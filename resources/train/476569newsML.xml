<p>Pre-Easter optimism had all but vanished on Monday as Marxist rebels slammed the government for its slow pace in reaching a negotiated solution for Peru's 104-day hostage crisis.</p>
<p>&quot;The slowness is due to the government's intransigency,&quot; charged &quot;Comrade Alejandro,&quot; a Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) military leader in Peru's eastern jungle.</p>
<p>&quot;The prisoners' issue is still not resolved,&quot; he added in a communication with Reuters. &quot;We will stay (in the residence) as long as is necessary to achieve the freedom of our prisoners.&quot;</p>
<p>The MRTA's demand for the release of jailed comrades has been the main sticking point since 20-odd rebels led by Nestor Cerpa blasted their way into the Japanese ambassador's residence during a cocktail party on Dec. 17.</p>
<p>Diplomatic and media circles were convinced last week the government and MRTA were close to an agreement involving asylum in Cuba for the hostage-takers, a possible ransom deal and the release of some lower-level prisoners.</p>
<p>But that optimism was dashed over the weekend as the MRTA made a string of tough public statements via the Internet, a banner draped outside the residence and a walkie-talkie conversation between Cerpa and journalists.</p>
<p>Fujimori said at the weekend he was still hopeful of a solution but was not prepared to shift his position on the prisoners' issue.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a lot of speculation during Holy Week that there would be a peaceful solution, but we were conscious that we were not in the final stage, that the conditions were not right,&quot; Fujimori said in a television interview.</p>
<p>&quot;Naturally, we are hopeful that it will be the soonest possible, but we do not foresee a date.&quot;</p>
<p>Although tension has been focused on possibilities for a peaceful solution, crack troops have been training in case of an assault and, according to intelligence reports, the MRTA has slipped an extra 70 fighters into Lima as a potential backup for those inside the residence.</p>
<p>Fujimori met on Monday at Government Palace with his chief negotiator in the crisis, Domingo Palermo, and members of a three-man guarantors' committee overseeing negotiations to end Latin America's longest hostage siege.</p>
<p>Japanese government observer Terusuke Terada was also present at the meeting, which lasted nearly two hours.</p>
<p>They made no comment to reporters afterward.</p>
<p>The guarantors have been holding separate &quot;parallel&quot; meetings with the MRTA and the government during a period of &quot;reflection&quot; since the last and 10th round of face-to-face talks on March 12. Last week's speculation focused on a supposed blueprint proposal by the guarantors to end the crisis.</p>
<p>The Vatican's representative on the guarantors' commission, Archbishop Juan Luis Cipriani, denied late on Sunday that talks between the two sides had &quot;broken down&quot; and called for patience and tolerance on all sides.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying to move as fast as possible,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The mainly middle-aged male hostages spent a quiet Easter weekend under the guns of their MRTA captors with whom they are said to have now formed close personal ties.</p>
<p>The Red Cross took in Easter eggs and fresh fruit along with their usual provisions on Sunday. A special Mass was held for the captives, who have also spent Christmas and the New Year inside the diplomatic compound.</p>
<p>While concern centred on the health of the hostages, Alejandro insisted the jungle-trained rebels inside were still in peak condition. &quot;They are doing well, both physically and morally,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Among the captives are the ambassadors of Japan and Bolivia; Fujimori's brother, Pedro; two Peruvian government ministers; military officers and Japanese businessmen and diplomats.</p>
