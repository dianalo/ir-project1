<p>Nigeria's military government has released 32.8 billion naira ($397.6 million) of the 89 billion naira budget to ministries and state-run bodies for capital projects in 1997, the national news agency said on Monday.</p>
<p>The News Agency of Nigeria quoted a finance ministry source as saying that the capital grant covers the period from July to September, while money allocated for special capital expenditures covers the first three quarters of the year. &quot;The non-release of capital grants since the beginning of the year has stalled activities in government ministries and parastatals and business activities nationwide,&quot; the agency report said.</p>
<p>No official reason has been given for the non-release of funds until now, which businesses say has aggravated an already-deep economic recession in Africa's most populous nation of over 100 million people.</p>
<p>Finance ministry officials privately say the reason for holding back lay partly in the desire to curtail wastage from ministries, by making them account for last year's expenditure before they received this year's, and partly in fear that spending would fuel inflation and weaken the naira currency.</p>
<p>Low inflation and a stable currency are the stated goals of military ruler General Sani Abacha's economic policies in the West African state whose economy is utterly dependent on spending of crude oil revenues.</p>
