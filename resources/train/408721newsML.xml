<p>Car rental rental company Avis Europe is likely to post full-year consolidated net profit of 50 million ecus (40 million pounds) compared with 15 million ecus, its Belgian parent company said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Avis Europe's bookyear ran until February 28, 1996.  </p>
<p>Avis Europe's forecast was based on results for the first 11 months and an estimate for this month.</p>
<p>Avis Europe, 77.1 percent held by leading Belgian car importer and distributor D'Ieteren , said earlier this year it wanted to list part of its capital on the London share market, which should raise about 250 million pounds.</p>
<p>The London Stock Exchange is due to approve the prospectus on Friday.</p>
<p>Avis Europe deputy chairman and D'Ieteren executive vice-president Gilbert van Marcke told a news conference the proceeds of the listing would be used to pay off debts, invest in development of rental activities and buy back General Motors (GM) stake in Avis Europe.</p>
<p>GM has a 14.2 percent in Avis Europe, Avis Inc 8.7 percent.</p>
<p>D'Ieteren said it planned to remain the majority shareholder in Avis Europe after its listing.</p>
<p>&quot;Apart from the planned operation, Avis Europe will buy back entirely the 8.7 percent stake now held by Avis Inc and acquire a 40-year licence to operate the Avis system in Asia in exchange for the payment of royalties,&quot; D'Ieteren said.</p>
<p>Van Marcke was confident the car rental market would grow further due to low interest rates, economic growth in Europe, expanding tourism and air travel.</p>
<p>In addition, Avis Europe also sees expansion in Central and Eastern Europe and in Asia.</p>
<p>Van Marcke added that future projects could include the launch of Avis activities in countries like India or China.</p>
