<p>India's troubled political scene will add to economic problems, keep investors jittery and give no respite to the country's sagging stock markets this week, brokers said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's legal problems top the list of flash points that could affect the market.</p>
<p>On Monday, a Delhi court will hear Rao's request to quash a non-bailable arrest warrant against him in a forgery case. The warrant was temporarily stayed on Friday shortly after it was issued by a lower court.</p>
<p>&quot;The market should fall if the stay on the non-bailable warrant issued against Rao is withdrawn,&quot; said Sanjay D'Souza, research head at Nucleus Securities. &quot;The possibility of his arrest will cast its shadow on the market.&quot;</p>
<p>The former premier faces another criminal conspiracy case in which he has won a temporary reprieve that excused him from personally appearing in court.</p>
<p>The legal troubles forced Rao to quit as president of the Congress party two weeks ago, and he is likely to resign as the party's leader in parliament where its support is crucial for the ruling coalition government to stay in office.</p>
<p>Congress has 140 seats in parliament.</p>
<p>Analysts believe Rao's exit is likely to trigger a political realignment with many former party stalwarts returning to the Congress, thus posing a threat to the four-month old minority government and possibly another national election.</p>
<p>Results of local polls in the politically sensitive northern Uttar Pradesh state, India's most populous, will be known this week and will set the realignment in motion.</p>
<p>The uncertainty could even slow economic reforms and curtail fresh foreign investment, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The first casualty at such times of uncertainty is the economy,&quot; said Rasesh Maniar, a dealer at broker Mukesh Babu.</p>
<p>&quot;We're in a recession and no one gives a damn,&quot; complained Zubin Tampal, dealer at broking firm Motilal Oswal. &quot;We're headed for bad times.&quot;</p>
<p>The gloomy economic outlook and forecasts of shrinking corporate earnings growth have already jolted the market. Some analysts say foreign fund managers, whose bonuses depend on the profits they earn on investments, have begun to book profits ahead of the calendar year's close.</p>
<p>The alarm bells were set off on Friday when the benchmark Bombay index dropped nearly 3.0 percent on heavy selling of blue-chip stocks by foreign institutional investors and local players.</p>
<p>&quot;There's strong possibility the foreigner institutional investors are booking profits to tidy their books (for 1996),&quot; said Ulhas Paymaster, a member-broker of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).</p>
<p>The 30-share BSE Index lost 153.46 points, or 4.71 percent, at 3,101.27 in the week ending last Friday.</p>
<p>Foreign institutional investor holdings in many blue-chip firms have reached the ceiling of 20-24 percent prescribed by the government. This has hit fresh demand as cash-starved domestic funds and equity-shy retail investors remain aloof.</p>
<p>Paymaster said he has advised his clients to sell. &quot;I see the index going down 500-600 points over the next 3-4 months,&quot; he added.</p>
