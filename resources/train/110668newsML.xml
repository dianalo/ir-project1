<p>Venezuela expects to record a steadily narrowing trade surplus this year and next as the economy begins to recover from a deep recession, Development Minister Freddy Rojas Parra said.</p>
<p>&quot;This year and next year the commercial balance will continue to be favorable,&quot; Rojas Parra said in an interview with Reuters late Thursday.  </p>
<p>The minister, who is also president of Venezuela's Foreign Trade Institute (ICE), would not specify the expected size of the trade balance, although he said the surplus would be smaller in 1997 due to rising imports associated with expected economic recovery.</p>
<p>Venezuela recorded trade surpluses of $2.45 billion and $1.582 billion in 1994 and 1995, according to Central Bank figures.  </p>
<p>Although still reliant for this surplus on strong oil exports, Parra said that Venezuela hopes to boost its monthly non-oil exports from about $400 million per month at present to $500 million per month sometime next year.</p>
<p>&quot;We are going to try to bring it up to $500 million per month, which would be $6 billion a year,&quot; Rojas Parra told Reuters in an interview late Thursday.</p>
<p>Non-traditional exports, which exclude oil and iron, were $430 million in August, up 20 percent on August 1995. But exports for the first eight months, at $2.661 billion, were down 13 percent on the same period last year.  </p>
<p>Venezuela's efforts to boost non-oil exports were being helped by a competitive exchange rate which since April has been set by the market, Rojas Parra said.</p>
<p>But Venezuela still has to overcome reluctance in the private sector to explore new markets.</p>
<p>&quot;The Venezuelan businessman does not have an exporting culture, it has to be nurtured,&quot; he said.</p>
