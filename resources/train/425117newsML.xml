<p>An Australian charity worker who doused a six-year-old Aboriginal boy with petrol and set him alight was on Thursday sentenced to life in prison.</p>
<p>Paul Streeton, 27, walked into a schoolyard in the northern state of Queensland last October and poured petrol over Tjandamurra O'Shane before setting him on fire.</p>
<p>O'Shane received burns to 60 percent of his body and spent three months in hospital recovering.</p>
<p>Streeton, who pleaded not guilty to attempted murder but guilty on the lesser charge of grievous bodily harm, was sentenced in the Queensland Supreme Court on Thursday.</p>
<p>In an audio tape played to the court, Streeton said he had chosen O'Shane at random as &quot;a sort of payback&quot; for mistreatment he claimed to have received as a child.</p>
<p>Streeton asked not to receive counselling while in prison and was given no set parole period by Judge Margaret White, who handed down the maximum sentence of life.</p>
