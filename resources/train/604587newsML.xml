<title>CZECH REPUBLIC: CZECH CROWN JUMPS AFTER CENTRAL BANK ANNOUNCEMENT.</title>
<headline>CZECH CROWN JUMPS AFTER CENTRAL BANK ANNOUNCEMENT.</headline>
<dateline>PRAGUE 1997-05-22</dateline>

<p>The Czech crown recovered some of its lost ground from earlier in the morning after the central bank agreed with major banks to restrict non-resident access to the money markets and close its last resort Lombard facility.</p>
<p>But the crown was volatile after the announcement, trading at 30.680 to the dollar and 18.021 to the mark, or 2.85 percent below central parity with its mark/dollar basket, with quotes ranging from -2.8 to -3.5 percent versus parity.</p>
<p>Prior to the announcement prohibitive hikes in the central bank's repo facility and direct intervention on the market helped the crown stabilise to around -4.0 percent below parity, that after the currency had dropped to below -6.0 percent in a huge selloff after trading opened.</p>
<p>Local dealers said that the central bank may have spent an estimated $500 million in buying crowns to prop up the currency, but then was forced to take more drastic action to stabilise the crown.</p>
<p>Dealers said the measures taken by central bank might help throughout the day but that the chances of holding rates at current levels in the longer term were not large.</p>
<p>Dealer Petr Kukla of Girocredit in Prague said the money market would be extremely short ater the measures, adding that banks in London had enough crowns at their disposal to continue in the attack on the Czech currency.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't know if the central bank realises that this is a huge destablisation of the interbank market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This prohibition of foreign entities can get us very far from the European Union. If the central bank is smart they will devalue (the crown) but they won't do it during the trading day.&quot;</p>
<p>The central bank fixed the crown after the announcement at -3.0 versus the basket, which was about where the market was trading at the time.</p>
