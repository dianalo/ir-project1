<p>The Swiss government gave final approval on Wednesday to a Holocaust memorial fund that gives world Jewish groups a big say in how to distrbute million of dollars in humanitarian aid to Hitler's victims.</p>
<p>The World Jewish Congress (WJC), which has led international criticism of Swiss banks and the Swiss financial role in World war Two, welcomed the decision as a big step towards better Jewish-Swiss relations after months of bitter wrangling.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Flavio Cotti told reporters the Federal Council, or cabinet, approved a decree that sets up the fund on March 1 after agreeing how to administer the pool of cash at talks on Monday and Tuesday with the WJC.</p>
<p>&quot;These talks led to a proposal for a solution which today was approved by the Federal Council,&quot; Cotti told reporters in Berne after a cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>Cotti did not say whether the government was closer to a decision on whether it will also pay into the fund, a choice it has delayed making until around mid-year.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a big step towards improving relations between the WJC and Swiss authorities,&quot; WJC assistant secretary general Maram Stern told Reuters.</p>
<p>The WJC and other critics, including U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato, have accused Swiss banks of sitting on accounts left by victims of Nazi genocide and the country as a whole of profiting cynically from its neutral status in World War Two.</p>
<p>The government agreed on February 12 to explore with Jewish groups how to administer humanitarian aid to Holocaust survivors from a fund launched with a donation of 100 million Swiss francs from Switzerland's three biggest banks.</p>
<p>The banks -- UBS, Credit Suisse Group and Swiss Bank Corp (SBC) -- acted after threats by world Jewish groups to call a boycott that would threaten their global business. The banks asked Berne to organise the fund.</p>
<p>&quot;The Federal Council will have overall supervision of the fund,&quot; the cabinet decree said.</p>
<p>&quot;The object of the fund is to support needy persons who were persecuted because of their race, religion or political views or...otherwise were victims of the Holocaust/Shoah, as well as to support their descendants in need,&quot; the decree read.</p>
<p>Officials have said a large part of the money is likely to go to Jewish groups and individuals in Eastern Europe who were cut off from compensation for decades by the Iron Curtain.</p>
<p>The decree sets up a board of seven directors, four of them Swiss to be named by Berne and three to be named by the World Jewish Restitution Organisation (WJRO), an umbrella group of major Jewish organisations and the state of Israel.</p>
<p>One of the four Berne-named members will be Rolf Bloch, head of the Swiss Jewish federation SIG, in order to strike a 50-50 balance between Jewish representatives and Swiss citizens, the WJC's Stern told Reuters.</p>
<p>The fund will have an advisory council of 18 members named by Swiss and foreign organisations including Jewish and other Holocaust victims, such as European gypsies. It will recommend to the directors how to spend the money.</p>
<p>Separately, the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA) urged its over 400 member banks to pay into the fund.</p>
<p>&quot;Further donations from the rest of the banking sector and other companies, the Swiss National Bank and the government must follow,&quot; SBA President Georg Krayer told reporters.</p>
<p>Berne politicians say the government intends to put up public money in the coming months after grooming broad political support for the step.</p>
<p>But a leading nationalist politician suggested he might organise a referendum against any government money for the fund.</p>
<p>Christoph Blocher, a right-wing member of parliament who led a successful drive to block closer Swiss ties to the European Union in 1992, said he objected to using tax payers' money.</p>
<p>Asked whether he would organise a referendum against a Berne contribution, he told the newspaper Blick, &quot;We will see.&quot;</p>
<p>Under Swiss direct democracy, any governmment policy can be challenged by referendum if 50,000 signatures are collected.</p>
