<p>Polish shares fell in lower turnover on Thursday and analysts saw more losses in the next few sessions amid profit-taking after the 9.3-percent growth since September 6.</p>
<p>The main market's WIG index fell two percent on Thursday to 14,536.9 and turnover fell 32.8 percent to 114.7 million zlotys ($41 million) on both markets as 58 issues fell, eight rose and 11 were flat.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices of several stocks have risen very high so taking profits is a natural reaction and I believe there are no fundamental reasons for the fall,&quot; said Michal Szczurek, an analyst at ING BSK Asset Management.</p>
<p>Analysts said 14,300 or 14,000 points of the WIG index should provide strong support for the market, which was likely to rebound after the profit-taking.</p>
<p>They said companies' August earnings reports, which for the second consecutive month proved better than in the disappointing first half, might keep the mood positive, but had been partially priced-in.</p>
<p>They said Thursday's biggest losers,  engineering firm Remak, construction company Espebepe and tyremaker Stomil Olsztyn, all fell after presenting unspectacular results.</p>
<p>Analysts also said that top gainers furniture maker Forte and paint maker Polifarb Cieszyn benefitted from particularily strong August earnings.</p>
<p>The bourse suspended trade in carpet maker Novita after the firm failed to present its August earnings on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Continuous trade turnover amounted to 2.4 million zlotys ($0.9 million) with the biggest mover steel trader Stalexport down 3.6 percent.</p>
