<p>NWE gas oil prices were sharply weaker on Wednesday after bearish U.S. crude and gasoline stock builds sent futures markets tumbling.</p>
<p>Traders said the API report for distillates was mildly bullish showing a 1.1 million barrel draw in U.S. stocks, but benchmark gas oil futures fell around $3 tugged lower by weaker crude and NYMEX gasoline futures.</p>
<p>Slack demand in Europe also put pressure on differentials to futures, adding a further 50 cents to $1 to overall losses.</p>
<p>In the key ARA market supportive buying interest from one major was less evident today adding to the dearth of demand.</p>
<p>Premiums for prompt lifting barges eased around 50 cents to June IPE +$1/$1.50 a tonne fob Rotterdam with sellers of early June liftings heard around June IPE $1.50 a tonne fob ARA.</p>
<p>EN590 barge and cargo premiums remained under pressure and were well offered at around June IPE +$12. Buyers were hard to find and notionally around $2 lower.</p>
<p>0.2 sulphur cargo differentials were also easier. Russian cargoes talked around June IPE +$2.50/$3.00 after 30kt traded into Hamburg around this level on Tuesday.</p>
