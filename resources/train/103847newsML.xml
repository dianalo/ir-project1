<p>National Mutual did not price its shares too cheaply before they were publicly floated, New Zealand general manager Anthony Ractliffe said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>His comments came shortly after National Mutual listed on the New Zealand and Australian stock exchanges at a sizeable premium to their retail and institutional application prices.</p>
<p>The shares listed in New Zealand at NZ$2.00 and traded up to $2.04, well above the retail application price of $1.70.  </p>
<p>&quot;I think it has certainly exceeded expectations, although we might have picked that there would be a premium when the institutions bid so well,&quot; Ractliffe told Reuters.</p>
<p>Brokers agreed that the initial share offering to both retail and institutional investors had been over-subscribed and demand for the stock was fierce at their listing.</p>
<p>But Ractliffe denied that the offer had been pitched too low. &quot;At $1.70 the general comment at the time was that that was really at the high end of expectations,&quot; he said. &quot;It was neatly pitched between net assets and net tangible assets.&quot;  </p>
<p>Ractliffe said the listing had been aided by global equity market strength.</p>
<p>&quot;We were helped in the end by generally good markets around the world, so I think we can be happy about that,&quot; he said. &quot;But I think the whole pricing exercise has been excellent.&quot;</p>
<p>The listing marked the end of a &quot;very successful episode for the company&quot; and had paved the way for other companies to demutualise in National Mutual's wake.  </p>
<p>&quot;We're the first cab off the rank in this part of the world and I have no doubt that other companies will follow -- we know CML (Colonial Mutual Life) are following shortly and there's a lot of talk about AMP and to a lesser extent Tower,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Really, it boils down in the end to where you get your capital from in the future, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to raise capital as a mutual organisation.</p>
<p>&quot;So I think they will follow our trend, but in fact, to be fair, we're only following an international trend.&quot;  </p>
<p>While the listing heralds a new era for National Mutual, it also marks the end of a 30-year career for Ractliffe, who will leave the company in about a month.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel I'm leaving the company on a high and I'm looking forward to doing something else around Wellington and still maintaining very friendly relationships, and indeed I'll be on a couple of National Mutual boards,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>National Mutual is owned 51 percent by insurance and financial services giant Axa SA.  </p>
<p>There were four million shares traded in the hour's trading available on the New Zealand exchange. Brokers said there was strong demand.</p>
<p>&quot;I think a lot of the institutions didn't get the holdings or the numbers that they were after, and I know that a lot of the retail investors were also scaled down. So I guess the natural progression on from there is that when they opened they were going to open at a bit of a premium, said Duncan Rutherford, broker at ANZ Securities.</p>
