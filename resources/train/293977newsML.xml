<p>The French Foreign Legion, one of the world's most famed fighting units, has taken on a new assignment far from the tropical expanses in which it usually operates - the Paris Metro.</p>
<p>The army said on Wednesday that a unit of some 320 legionnaires had fanned out in metro and RER (regional express) stations this week as part of the Vigipirate plan in which more than 2,000 soldiers are helping police patrol train and metro stations as well as airports.</p>
<p>The security plan was put into operation shortly after a December 3 rush-hour bombing of a commuter train which killed four people and wounded nearly 100.</p>
<p>Algerian Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas who claimed responsibility for an earlier wave of bombings in 1995 are suspected of also being behind the latest blast.</p>
<p>Most Paris commuters hurrying to catch trains did not seem to notice the Legion was present.</p>
<p>The public is used to used to the sight of the legionnaires on parade at Bastille Day, July 14, clad in dress uniforms and distinctive white kepi hats. However, those patrolling the metro in groups of four, each led by a gendarme (para-military policeman), wore the green berets and combat fatigues which are their operational gear together with their Famas assault rifles.</p>
<p>The legionnaires however are generally older, more physically fit and tougher - or meaner - looking than the young conscripts who have been on metro duty in the past weeks.</p>
<p>Those on duty in the metro appeared particularly unsmiling and people, mainly North African youths, asked to present their identity documents to the gendarmes leading the patrols looked uneasy when they realised who they were dealing with.</p>
<p>Army spokemen questioned about the legionnaires insisted their presence was nothing extraordinary although they admitted some people might be critical of foreign mercenary soldiers on police duty in the capital.</p>
<p>The 8,500-strong Legion was long banned from being stationed in France. Some of its units have been garrisoned here, however, since 1962 when France lost the vast North African territory of Algeria where it was headquartered.</p>
<p>The Legion, made up of men from about 80 countries, is famed both for iron discipline on duty as well as for robust behaviour on the battlefield and sometimes on leave.</p>
<p>One of the Legion's best known units, the First Foreign Parachute Regiment (1er REP), was disbanded after it spearheaded an attempt to topple then-president Charles de Gaulle over the Algerian issue in April 1961.</p>
<p>Legion units are currently based in several African countries where they prop up governments allied to Paris.</p>
<p>Others are based in southern France, like those drafted to Paris, where they often pitch in for heavy duty rescue work during floods or other catastrophes.</p>
<p>About 40 percent of recent recruits come from east European countries in the same way in which the Legion was flooded with Tsarist officers after the 1917 Russian Revolution, defeated Spanish Republicans after Spain's 1936-39 Civil War and veterans of Hitler's armies after the Second World War.</p>
