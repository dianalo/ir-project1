<p>A weak single European currency is not the answer to the structural problems which make European countries less competitive, Bundesbank council member Reimut Jochimsen said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Jochimsen said in a speech for delivery to a New Year reception in Dusseldorf, &quot;It would be fatal to believe now that we could buy ourselves out of our problems with a cheap euro.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that there was no alternative to structural reform to address issues which were caused by out-dated conditions.</p>
<p>&quot;As a sober look at some of our neighbours, such as the Netherlands and Denmark, demonstrates neither a lower exchange rate, nor an explosion in state spending, nor ever more increases in taxes and levies are needed to overcome these problems,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Jochimsen also hit out at apparent differences with France over the role of the future European Central Bank adding that it was essential that such difference in views be ironed out ahead of the start of monetary union in 1999.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be fatal to postpone such differences into the future as this could bring a rude awakening,&quot; he said. &quot;If we want to stick with the goal of monetary union they must be brushed aside now.</p>
