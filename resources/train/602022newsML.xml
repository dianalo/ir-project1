<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Thursday were seen steady to $0.50 per cwt higher, buoyed by expectations for competition among packers for tight available hog supplies, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Firm hog demand also was anticipated amid ideas that stronger pork prices would improve poor operating margins and stimulate increased packer demand, they said.</p>
<p>Pork prices were lifted by further reductions in hog slaughter, compared with last week, as packers tightened their belts another notch in an attempt to counter margins that were deep in the red, dealers said.  </p>
<p>Hog slaughter Wednesday was estimated at 327,000 head, compared with 333,000 a week ago, USDA said. The week to date figure was pegged at 948,000 head, down 1.8 percent from a week ago at 965,000, USDA statistics showed.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota top prices for hogs delivered to the plant could range $59.00 to $59.50 and Illinois top prices could span $58.50 to $59.00, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Indiana/Ohio top prices for hogs at the plant were seen $59.00 to $59.50, they said.</p>
