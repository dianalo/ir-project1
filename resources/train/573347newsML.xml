<p>Spanish gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of 1997 may have increased by around 2.7 percent versus the year-earlier quarter, the central bank estimated in its first quarter report, released on Friday.</p>
<p>Data from National Statistics Institute INE showed that GDP rose a provisional 2.6 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of 1996.  </p>
<p>The Bank of Spain also estimated domestic demand growth at more than 1.5 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, versus 1.4 percent growth as announced by INE in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;This evaluation is based on more dynamic private --rather than public-- consumption, and a recovery in the impulse of capital goods investment, while at the same time the fall in construction investment continues to soften,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>Exports are still increasing at a &quot;remarkable&quot; rate, although lower than in the fourth quarter when they grew 12.1 percent year-on-year, while imports &quot;seem to have picked up&quot;.</p>
<p>If this trend is confirmed, exports' contribution to GDP will have been high in the first quarter, although below the fourth quarter rate, the central bank said.</p>
<p>Inflation, which fell to a 29-year low of 2.2 percent year- on-year in March, was approaching the bank's medium term target of 2.0 percent, it said.</p>
