<p>A spokesman for Walt Disney Co said the company has no plans to file its annual proxy statement on Monday.</p>
<p>Separately, the company said former President Michael Ovitz officialy left Disney on December 27, about one month sooner than originally planned.  </p>
<p>The statement comes in response to media reports the company would file the proxy today. The proxy is expected to contain details of Ovitz' severance package, which is estimated to be worth more than $90 million in cash and stock.</p>
<p>Ovitz, a former talent agent, announced plans last month to leave his post at Disney after only 14 months.  </p>
<p>On Friday, a group of shareholders filed a lawsuit against Disney and several executives seeking to block the severance package. However, Disney said the lawsuit is &quot;without merit&quot; and the company intends to defend it &quot;vigorously&quot;.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the lawsuit is also late in calling for injuctive relief because Ovitz ended his employment with Disney last month and already received his severance payment. The company declined to say how much Ovitz received.</p>
