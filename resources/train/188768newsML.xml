<title>BELARUS: Belarus deputy minister quits, blames Lukashenko.</title>
<headline>Belarus deputy minister quits, blames Lukashenko.</headline>

<p>A senior government official in Belarus tendered his resignation on Thursday in protest against the policies of President Alexander Lukashenko, who is accused by critics of being increasingly authoritarian.</p>
<p>&quot;I have tendered my resignation because I do not agree with the policies of President Lukashenko,&quot; Deputy Foreign Minister Andrei Sannikov said in his office. He gave no further details.</p>
<p>It was the first sign of open resistance to Lukashenko in the government since a row broke out with parliament over his plans to use a November 24 referendum to broaden his powers.</p>
<p>There was no immediate confirmation from the foreign ministry or Lukashenko's administration that Sannikov's resignation had been accepted.</p>
<p>The last public government resignation in Belarus was last December when Viktor Gonchar quit as deputy prime minister, saying Lukashenko was under the influence of &quot;rogues&quot;.</p>
<p>On November 1, Lukashenko sacked his defence minister for turning up apparently drunk at an official ceremony.</p>
<p>Lukashenko has been widely criticised over his approach to the referendum, in which he is seeking to extend his term by more than two years to November 2000 and to appoint half the constitutional court and half the electoral commmission.</p>
<p>Gonchar, elected by parliament to run the Central Electoral Commission, has declared he will not validate the results of the vote, which Lukashenko has decreed as legally binding.</p>
<p>Parliament and the constitutional court have ruled that the results of the poll -- seen as a confidence vote in the president -- will only be advisory.</p>
<p>Lukashenko, a flamboyant former collective farm director, won overwhelming support from voters in July 1994 on promises to sweep away government corruption.</p>
