<headline>Peru government and rebels start talks- Red Cross.</headline>
<dateline>LIMA 1997-02-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Peru's government and Marxist rebels holding VIP hostages at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima on Friday started a second round of face-to-face talks to end the crisis, the Red Cross said.</p>
<p>Government negotiator Domingo Palermo arrived first at a Red Cross safe house used for a first round of talks last Tuesday. Minutes later, a Red Cross car entered the diplomatic compound and, out of sight of witnesses, picked up a rebel and took him across the street to the safe house, Red Cross spokeswoman Cecile Baux said.  </p>
<p>As the Red Cross car pulled out of the compound, Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebel hymns were heard coming from inside the residence, witnessses said.</p>
<p>The rebel inside the car was believed to be Rolly Rojas, the MRTA's second-in-command, who attended Tuesday's talks.</p>
<p>Also present at the meeting were members of a guarantors' commission, made up of officials of the Red Cross, the Vatican and the Canadian government, as well as a Japanese government observer.</p>
<p>Tuesday's meeting produced a pledge for further talks but little more apparent progress towards a peaceful solution. The rebels refuse to give up their demand for the release of over 400 jailed comrades, which the government flatly rejects.</p>
