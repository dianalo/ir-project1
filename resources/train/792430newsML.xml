<headline>INDONESIAN RUPIAH SOFTER ON RINGGIT SPILLOVER.</headline>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah was softer against the dollar due to a spillover from the weaker Malaysian ringgit in early trading on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>One U.S. bank dealer said fresh ringgit selling in a market response to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's comments pushed the rupiah lower. However, profit-taking limited the downside.</p>
<p>Mahathir told reporters on Friday the ringgit's fall of about five percent against the dollar was not much &quot;if compared with the deutschemark which has fallen by 17 percent&quot;.</p>
<p>The dealer said dollar profit-takers and selling from state banks capped the upside at the 2,610 level.  </p>
<p>Another local bank dealer said corporate orders and foreign dollar selling helped the rupiah recover to 2,601.0/03.0 at 0240 GMT from an opening of 2,608.0/13.0. But the rupiah was lower than Friday's close of 2,598.0.</p>
<p>&quot;There were some fights at the 2,600 level. If the rupiah falls through the 2,600 barrier, it becomes the resistance level, but if it strengthens above that, the 2,600 becomes the support level for the rupiah,&quot; the U.S. bank dealer said.</p>
<p>The dealer said there was some resistance for the rupiah to breach the 2,600 barrier because of renewed pressure on the Malaysian ringgit.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is not much drive in the market. Volume is pretty thin, with operators seen sidelined. It's a non-event day.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. bank dealer said swaps were also stable on adequate liquidity supply in the money market. Overnight money was at 15.0/15.5 percent on Monday morning.</p>
<p>Overnight swap was at 0.45/0.55 and tom/next at 0.40/0.42.</p>
<p>One-month swap was at 19.5/20.5, two at 37.0/42.0, three at 57.0/63.0 and six at 118.5/122.0 points.</p>
<p>The central bank kept its intervention band at 2,378/2,682 but raised the conversion band to 2,573/2,621 on Friday from 2,567/2,615 on Thursday. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364</p>
