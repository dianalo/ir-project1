<p>Egypt's Football Federation has banned defender Ibrahim Hassan from the international squad for life for making an obscene gesture to Moroccan fans during an African Nation's Cup qualifier.</p>
<p>In a meeting on Tuesday night, the federation also suspended Hassan from playing for his club Ahli for a year over the incident during last Saturday's match in Rabat.</p>
<p>Ahli had already fined Hassan 10,000 Egyptian pounds ($2,950) and slapped its own six-month ban on him.</p>
<p>Morocco beat Egypt 1-0 in the bad-tempered tie.</p>
<p>Hassan told reporters he had made a mistake but said he hoped the federation would take into account the pressure he was under during his stay in Morocco.</p>
<p>&quot;We were bombarded with insults that no one could bear and to attacks against me and my twin brother Hossam Hassan particularly. The fans also insulted Egypt and there were was unbearable provocation,&quot; Hassan said.</p>
