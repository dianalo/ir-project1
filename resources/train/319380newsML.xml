<p>NWE naphtha prices edged lower in quiet activity while high freight rates continued to hamstring the Mediterranean market, frustrating buyers and suffocating arbitrage deals, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has a very specific issue right now and it is the freight problem,&quot; one said. &quot;There are no vessels.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;There is material and there is (buying) interest...The arb is not clearly open to the U.S. with the freight rates so we're not going to see many cargoes going to the States,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>North African supplies were becoming available while demand was emerging for February material.</p>
<p>But few deals were heard getting done.</p>
<p>Swaps for the rest of January dropped $2.50 to $216.50/$217.50, and Feb fell the same amount to $214/$215 a tonne, traders said. March also lost $2.50 to $211/$212.</p>
<p>Physical trading was limited with NWE cargoes notionally assessed down $3 at $218/$221 for prompt material. Med cargoes were off $4 notionally at $215/$217.</p>
<p>Volatile crude prices continued to whipsaw naphtha as well, traders said, and a slight recovery in IPE Brent futures by midday may have cushioned naphtha's selloff.</p>
<p>In Northwest Europe, some Russian material was placed late last week but fresh supplies were seen becoming available for the rest of January and early February, another trader said.</p>
<p>The Med trader said it appeared to be easier to find a small vessel in Northwest Europe, but that demand was more robust in the Med.</p>
<p>&quot;What will be the final solution?&quot; this trader asked. &quot;We will probably have to wait for the vessels to come and wait for February demand.&quot;</p>
