<p>NYMEX January electricity futures rocketed toward contract highs midday Monday on outlook of plummeting temperatures later this week and a meteoric rise in natural gas prices.</p>
<p>Natural gas prices at all major receipt points in the U.S. jumped in tandem with today's surge in January Henry Hub gas futures which posted all-time high of $4.420 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>Electricity prices have been moving in lock step with gas prices for the past several weeks.</p>
<p>Forecast of well below-normal temperatures across the U.S. by mid-week was the primary trigger of today's run-up in all energy futures.</p>
<p>The electricity complex was also bolstered by strong cash prices in the western U.S..</p>
<p>The Bonneville Power Administration provided further impetus to today's bullish sentiments by offering next-day peak power at prices about $2.00 a megawatt hour (MWh) higher than Friday's spot levels.</p>
<p>In early western trading, next-day power for firm, peak delivery at the California-Oregon Border was quoted near $28.00 and the Palo Verde (PV) switchyard in Arizona near $26.00.</p>
<p>January 1997 COB futures were up $2.35/MWh to $27.85 after hitting as high as $28.75, just shy of its life-of-contract high of $28.85.</p>
<p>February COB jumped $2.00 to $21.50. Other active COB months were also higher midday.</p>
<p>January Palo Verde (PV) futures rose $2.90 to $27.58 after touching its contract high of $29.00.</p>
<p>February PV was up $2.60 at $22.90 after posting a new contract high at $23.50. March PV set a new contract high at $21.60.</p>
<p>Friday, COB's open interest ended at 3,956 contracts, up 86 and PV's at 1,834, down six.</p>
<p>As of 1200 EST, 188 COB and 69 PV contracts were sold.</p>
