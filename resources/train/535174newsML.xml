<p>Yugoslavia expects consumption of oil products to rise by 18 percent this year to 3.8 million tonnes, the Yugoslav Chamber of Commerce said in its latest report.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a significant increase in consumption was expected following lifting of sanctions last October,&quot; said Dusan Trifunovic of the chamber's council of traders in oil derivatives.</p>
<p>&quot;But the consumption is still 30 percent lower than in pre-sanction years,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Out of 3.8 million tonnes of refined products, diesel and heating oil account for 1.2 million tonnes or 30.9 percent, crude oil 1.055 million or 27.2 percent and petrol accounts for 725,000 tonnes or 18.7 percent.</p>
<p>The products will be secured from domestic crude oil output estimated at 1.039 million tonnes and 2.6 million tonnes of crude imports.</p>
<p>Domestic refineries are expected to produce 3.375 million tonnes of products and another 614.000 tonnes will be imported, the report said.</p>
<p>The government has established import quotas for petrol at 55,000 tonnes, diesel and heating oil at 100,000 tonnes, crude oil at 180,000 tonnes, primary petrol at 150,000 tonnes, kerosene at 24,000 tonnes and 105,000 tonnes of other oil products.</p>
<p>Buda Kopri, secretary to the Chamber's Energy Committee, said estimated consumption was not in proportion to a targeted 13 percent rise in gross domestic product.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of the planed consumption is obviously irrational and efforts must be made to reduce spending,&quot; he said. -- Gordana Kukic, Belgrade Newsroom +381 11 222 4254</p>
