<p>General Motors Corp.'s decision to sell the defence business of Hughes Electronics to Raytheon Corp. is a blow to losing bidder Northrop Grumman Corp., but experts say Northrop will remain a major player in the defence industry.</p>
<p>&quot;They are going to be disappointed, but at these prices and depending on what kind of alternative strategy Northrop has picked, they might come out ahead,&quot; said Jon Kutler, an investment banker at Quarterdeck Investment Partners.</p>
<p>&quot;Northrop has some extremely strong franchises and I still don't believe you have to be a $30 billion company to be a survivor in this industry,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>General Motors agreed to sell the Hughes assets to Raytheon for $9.5 billion despite receiving a higher bid from Northrop, experts said.</p>
<p>Sources said that Northrop's final bid for the Hughes defence assets was $10 billion. A crucial factor in the decision was that GM would have held a majority stake if the assets were sold to Northrop, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;Northrop actually bid more,&quot; said Joeseph Campbell, aerospace and defence analyst at Lehman Brothers. &quot;The question was, 'Would you rather own a third of Raytheon or about 60 percent of Northrop?' and (GM) made this choice ... that the market would most likely make all of this easier using Raytheon,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's not that much (defense business) to compete for in the next five years,&quot; he added. &quot;This is a longer-term consequence.&quot;</p>
<p>Most of the contracts for major defence projects for the next five years have already been won, meaning Northrop has some time to assess how it will compete for future contracts.</p>
<p>Northrop, which had 1995 revenues of $6.8 billon, specialises in electronics and systems integration and commercial and military aircraft aerostructures.</p>
<p>Among its strongest franchises are the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System, known as Joint-STARS, its B-2 Stealth bomber, its production of the fuselage, tail and systems for the F-18 fighter jet, and making fuselage and tail sections of the Boeing 747 and a variety of parts for Boeing's 757, 767 and 777 aircraft.</p>
<p>&quot;(Many of) the businesses that Northrop has ... are essentially unassailable positions,&quot; Campbell said.</p>
<p>The aerospace and defence industry has been consolidating since 1985. The first wave of consolidation ran from 1985 through 1987, when companies bought each other because they thought that defence was a growth industry. That round of consolidation was sparked by the 1985 acquisition of Hughes by General Motors.</p>
<p>The second wave of consolidation, from 1992 through 1997, was driven by a need become more efficient through cost-cutting and gaining economies of scale in an attempt to raise profits in the face of shrinking U.S. government defence spending. Analysts say the latest round of consolidation of prime contractors ended Thursday with the sale of Hughes.</p>
<p>&quot;This could very well be one of the very last deals that dips under the wire from a scrutiny standpoint,&quot; said Quarterdeck's Kutler.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has encouraged consolidation in the defence and aerospace industry to cut costs and increase competition. With those efficiencies now in place, the Pentagon is expected to take a frostier stance to large mergers and acquisitions at a prime contractor level, experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're starting to cross the line between reductions of cost, which was good for the customer, to reduced competition, which ultimately will be bad, and because of that I don't see hostile takeovers because the regulatory angle makes it too easy to defeat,&quot; Kutler said.</p>
<p>That means that while Northrop may choose to buy smaller players, it is an unlikely target of a hostile bid from a larger defence player, analysts said.</p>
<p>Further consolidation will likely be on a smaller scale, with deals in the $1 billion to $1.5 billion range.</p>
<p>&quot;There's still some deals to do, but it's like sweeping the floor after the construction project,&quot; said Campbell.</p>
<p>&quot;Northrop will focus on operating the businesses they have ... and investigate whether any of the smaller players would be interested in selling, and if they're smart, they will see if there may be opportunities in Europe where there has been no consolidation,&quot; he added.</p>
