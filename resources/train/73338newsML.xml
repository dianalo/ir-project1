<p>North Sea crudes were firmer on Tuesday, lifted by a wave of demand from refiners keen to take advantage of improved product margins, particularly for gas oil, traders said.</p>
<p>Dated Brent moved to a premium to Nov Brent paper as a U.K. major holding most of the October programme nominated so far sold an Oct 4-6 cargo to a northwest European refiner for Nov +3 cents a barrel.</p>
<p>A cargo with the same dates traded at Nov parity on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;There seems to be more interest from refiners -- they're seeing pretty good margins at the moment,&quot; said a trader.  </p>
<p>Brent paper was also holding on to early gains with Nov Brent up 16 cents at $22.42 a barrel by 1537 GMT and the Nov/Dec intermonth spread three or four cents firmer at +49/+51 cents.</p>
<p>Two Brent cargoes were passing through the paper chains.</p>
<p>Other North Sea grades were also benefiting from the refinery buying spree, with Norwegian Oseberg, Ekofisk and Statfjord all moving at slightly higher premiums than the last reported deals, traders said.</p>
<p>Oct 20-22 Ekofisk traded as high as Dated Brent +27 cents a barrel, compared with +12 cents for an Oct 4-6 cargo on Monday. Traders said the premium partly reflected the later dates.  </p>
<p>In the Mediterranean, Urals tightness prompted sellers to seek a 10-cent premium on October barrels, offering Dated Brent -65 cents against the last deal on Monday at Dated Brent -75 cents a barrel cif Italy.</p>
<p>With the National Iranian Oil Co (NIOC) still claiming to be sold out until late in October, even buyers were prepared to value Urals at Dated Brent -70 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;This time they (NIOC) must be almost right because we are trying to negotiate some barrels with them without success,&quot; said a Med refiner.</p>
