<p>Havana revived biological warfare charges against the United States on Friday, alleging a U.S. government crop-dusting plane crossed Cuba in October and dumped bugs that have caused crop disease on the island.</p>
<p>The ruling Communist Party daily Granma devoted two of its eight pages to the allegations. It did not say why Cuba chose this moment to renew charges it initially made in early May, but Havana could be planning to raise the issue at next week's U.N. General Assembly session on the environment, which will be attended by a number of heads of state and government.</p>
<p>Cuba said in May a U.S. plane used for narcotic crop eradication dumped Thrips palmi insects on western Cuba as it flew over the island en route from Florida to the Cayman Islands last Oct. 21. It said Thrips palmi, not previously present on the island, emerged two months later, causing damage to crops in western areas of the island.</p>
<p>At the time Washington dismissed the accusation it was responsible as &quot;an outrageous charge&quot; and called Cuba's allegations &quot;deliberate misinformation.&quot; The State Department acknowledged the flight but said the crop duster merely used its smoke generator to mark its position for a Cuban commercial aircraft passing below it.</p>
<p>Granma on Friday carried comments by the Foreign Ministry disputing the U.S. account, interviews with the Cubana de Aviacion plane crew on what they saw and a list of past alleged biological warfare by the United States.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry said the S2R single-engine crop duster was not normally equipped with a smoke generator, the pilot did not report his supposed use of smoke on arrival at his destination and ascertaining different aircraft positions was for local air traffic control to do, not pilots.</p>
<p>The pilot and co-pilots of the Cubana de Aviacion plane, on a flight from Havana to eastern Las Tunas province, said they had seen a liquid substance, not smoke, emitted by the plane.</p>
<p>Granma also listed past &quot;biological attacks&quot; by the United States on Cuba, including charges the United States introduced human and plant diseases responsible for epidemics of conjunctivitis and haemorrhagic dengue fever and for damage to sugar cane and tobacco plantations from 1979-81.</p>
