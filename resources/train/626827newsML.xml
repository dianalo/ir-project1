<headline>CVS to shed 120 Revco stores in FTC pact.</headline>
<dateline>WOONSOCKET, R.I.</dateline>
<text>
<p>CVS Corp. said Friday it will sell 120 Revco D.S. Inc. stores under an agreement with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission as part of the merger of the two drug store chains.</p>
<p>CVS said the FTC agreement allowed it to complete the $2.8 billion merger with Revco, which also involves CVS assuming about $900 million of Revco debt.</p>
<p>To satisfy FTC concerns over the huge market presence resulting from the merger of the two retail drug giants, CVS agreed to give up 120 Revco stores in Virginia and New York state.</p>
<p>CVS said 114 stores in the Richmond and Tidewater areas will be sold to Eckerd Corp.,a division of J.C. Penney Co Inc.</p>
<p>Eckerd, in a separate statement, said terms of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The remaining stores, located in Binghamton, N.Y., will be sold to Medicine Shoppe International Inc.</p>
<p>Under the merger, each share of Revco will be exchanged for 0.8842 CVS share. About 60 million CVS shares will be issued to Revco shareholders, based on a total of about 67.8 million outstanding Revco shares, excluding about four million Revco stock options.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very pleased to complete this merger, which brings together two industry leaders and will provide new opportunities for CVS to accelerate its growth,&quot; CVS Chairman and Chief Executive officer Stanley Goldstein said in a statement.</p>
<p>CVS shareholders voted to approve the transaction at the company's annual meeting on May 27. Revco shareholders approved the merger at a special meeting on May 28.</p>
<p>Revco, with 1996 sales of approximately $5.4 billion, operates nearly 2,600 stores in 17 Midwestern, Southeastern and Eastern states.</p>
<p>CVS, with annual sales of $5.5 billion in 1996, is a leading drug store chain in the Northeast and Middle Atlantic regions. As of April 26, 1997, CVS operated 1,425 stores in 14 states and the District of Columbia.</p>
