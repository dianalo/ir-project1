<p>South Africa's Bafokeng tribe is flexing its muscles by threatening to go to court and seize the mining assets of Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd (Implats) -- but the move is unlikely to affect production, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Bafokeng, entitled to 14.9 percent of Impala's taxable income from current lease royalties, said in an advertisement in South African newspapers earlier this week that litigation to nullify Implats' right to mine on tribal land was proceeding.</p>
<p>The tribe said if the legal action was succesful, it will reacquire the ore reserve and ownership of all Implats' fixed mining assets.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Bafokeng threat was a show of force and possibly an attempt to influence major shareholder Gencor Ltd to put pressure on the company to pay more royalties.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bafokeng obviously want to flex their muscles,&quot; BOE NatWest platinum analyst Paul Brogan said.</p>
<p>Implats said on April 24 that confidential negotiations with the Bafokeng aimed at ending the dispute have been terminated and on Friday managing director Steve Kearney said there &quot;will be no comment from the company at this stage&quot;.</p>
<p>The tribe maintains that 1990 agreements with Implats signed on their behalf by the then president of the nominally-independent Bophuthatswana homeland, Lucas Mangope, were invalid.</p>
<p>The deal also extended in perpetuity previous agreements concluded on behalf of the tribe dating back to 1977 and 1986 which otherwise would have had to be renegotiated in 1993.</p>
<p>Bophuthatswana was reincorporated into South Africa after the demise of apartheid and President Nelson Mandela's government came into power three years ago.</p>
<p>Societe Generale Frankel Pollack analyst Ross Gardiner said the tribe had now embarked on a political powerplay.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a pure political play...and it is about the pursuit of wealth.&quot;</p>
<p>Brogan said the worst case scenario would be that Implats -- which produced 900,000 ounces of platinum in 1995 -- would shut down its operations until the dispute is over, but he said this was unlikely.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the middle road would be that they increase the amount of royalty that they pay to the Bafokeng.</p>
<p>&quot;Impala can't survive without the Bafokeng and the Bafokeng can't survive without Impala,&quot; Brogan added.</p>
<p>Brogan and Gardiner said the dispute would have no impact on production at Implats. But an analyst who asked not to be named, said the Bafokeng could be trying to damage Implats' share price.</p>
<p>&quot;It is the most ferocious attack I've seen yet. I think they are going out of their way to do some damage to share prices,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
<p>Implats' share price dropped from 51.25 rand before the advertisement was placed to the current 49.75.</p>
<p>The analyst said Gencor -- which owns 46 percent of Implats -- had also come under attack from the Bafokeng.</p>
<p>&quot;They have actually attacked Gencor viciously as well as Impala. Maybe there is some bigger game afoot or maybe they are just trying to put a lot of pressure on Gencor to force Impala to pay up.</p>
<p>&quot;Gencor doesn't want its name dragged through the dirt. Impala is not very important to Gencor,&quot; the analyst said.</p>
