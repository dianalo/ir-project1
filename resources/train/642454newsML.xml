<p>The South African Medicines Control Council has reached agreement with the government on most aspects of a controversial draft law on medicines, but the pharmaceutical industry has demanded a delay in its passage.</p>
<p>The bill, due to be passed by parliament in the next two weeks, proposes to introduce international tendering for state medicine requirements, to curtail marketing practices and enforce a single price to all consumers and to promote generic substitution of medicines.</p>
<p>The Medicines Control Council (MCC) reported to parliament's health committee that it had agreed with the health ministry on a number of amendments to the draft bill.</p>
<p>But a spokesman said they remained divided on the definition of foreign substitutes with the government rejecting a requirement that the production site, as well as brand name, be part of the description of an acceptable foreign alternative.</p>
<p>The MCC also rejected a proposal that the minister and not the council should have the final say in the event of a deadlock between them.</p>
<p>In one of parliament's most heavily attended public hearings since the transition to democracy in 1994, industry lobbyists, nurses and doctors swamped the health committee with testimony on the proposed Medicines and Related Substances Control Amendment Bill.</p>
<p>The 1.9 million-member Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) hailed the proposals as a bid to make health care more affordable to workers.</p>
<p>Urging legislators to resist pressure from the pharmaceutical industry, the labour federation said at present 20 percent of the annual 10 billion rand expenditure on medicines went to the poorest 80 percent of the population.</p>
<p>&quot;Cosatu supports these price-reducing mechanisms proposed by the bill and we strongly reject the scare tactics being used by large multi-national pharmaceutical corporations, who are trying to bully the Minister of Health and even parliament in an attempt to stop the implementation of the proposed reforms,&quot; the federation said in a submission to the committee.</p>
<p>The committee will prepare a final draft of the bill, which is virtually assured of passage through the parliament, in which Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma's African National Congress holds 60 percent of the seats.</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association (PMA) accused the Health Ministry of rushing the bill through parliament and demanded a postponement pending further evidence.</p>
<p>Spokesman Nico Vermaak said the PMA had been allocated 10 minutes for its evidence when it needed at least two hours to make a proper submission.</p>
<p>The association produced similar figures to the Cosatu analysis of relative spending on the rich and poor, but said that while spending was much higher in the private sector, about two thirds by volume of all medicines went to the poorest 80 percent of the population.</p>
<p>Health committee chairman Abe Nkomo noted the objections of the industry and said the committee would discuss them later.</p>
