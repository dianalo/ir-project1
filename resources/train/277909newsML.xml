<title>MALAYSIA: Malaysian finance tycoon who never sings the blues.</title>
<headline>Malaysian finance tycoon who never sings the blues.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-12-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Azman Hashim is a singer with three albums under his belt, has been the host of a TV show, loves fast cars and has set a powerboat racing record.</p>
<p>He also heads the Arab-Malaysian group, one of Malaysia's biggest finance houses whose activities are almost as diverse as his hobbies.</p>
<p>At 57, Azman, a self-motivated ethnic Malay who grew up in a humble two-room house in Kuala Lumpur, is said to be one of Malaysia's richest men.</p>
<p>His group is into merchant banking, credit finance, commercial banking, trust business, insurance and property development with assets in excess of 36 billion ringgit ($14.3 billion).</p>
<p>But, after setting a scorching pace for 14 years that has helped the group grow out of relative obscurity to the top of the field, the Arab-Malaysian chairman is not sitting still.</p>
<p>Azman says there is a lot more to be done, like maintaining a 30-40 percent annual profit growth for group companies and keeping pace with the country's fast-changing financial sector.</p>
<p>And there is no doubt who is driving the group. Azman takes pride in being involved in every aspect of growth.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not an executive. I am only part-time chairman, but I am hands-on, all right. Probably that is why I enjoy it,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview on Thursday.</p>
<p>A chartered accountant by training, he has a certain disregard for formal management practices.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think I have any management philosophy, I don't follow any gurus and I don't read management books,&quot; he says.</p>
<p>He keeps in touch with the world of business through newspapapers and magazines like Forbes. &quot;I manage by the seat of my pants. Basically I run (the group) the Malaysian way.</p>
<p>&quot;We are soft in our management, in the Malaysian way. I treat people as friends and I don't tolerate bullying or throwing weight around by anyone,&quot; Azman says.</p>
<p>Though often accused by industry people of setting impossible targets for his managers to achieve his goals, the group chairman also enjoys the rating of being one of the best managers in the business.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the International Financing Review rated Arab-Malaysian Merchant Bank (AMMB) Asia's &quot;Finance House of the year 1996&quot;.</p>
<p>Azman is passionate when talking about financial issues. He does not want Malaysia to open the securities industry any further to global competition.</p>
<p>&quot;We have already opened up more than other markets. We are among the top 10 most free markets. Personally I think we don't have to open any more.&quot;</p>
<p>Malaysia allows foreigners to hold 49 percent equity in brokerages and opening up further would be disastrous, he says.</p>
<p>&quot;Then what happens, all the Wall Street giants come and swallow us up. What happens to Malaysians?&quot; he says.</p>
