<title>ZIMBABWE: Falcon, Falgold issue cautionaries.</title>
<headline>Falcon, Falgold issue cautionaries.</headline>
<dateline>HARARE 1997-02-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Zimbabwe's Falgold Ltd and its holding company Falcon Ltd on Monday urged shareholders to exercise caution in dealings because the recent decline in the gold price had rendered certain mining operations unprofitable.</p>
<p>These operations would have to be curtailed and as a result the group was unlikely to achieve its expected gold output for the second half of the year of 1,321 kg of gold, the companies said in cautionary announcements.</p>
<p>&quot;The substantial decline in the international gold price has rendered some of the group mining operations unprofitable,&quot; the cautionary statements said.</p>
<p>Falcon also said that it could no longer be &quot;prudent&quot; to maintain the company's annual rate of dividend of 20 U.S. cents.</p>
<p>The companies said that results for the year ending March 31, which are expected to be posted by early June, would report on the effects of these actions in more detail.</p>
<p>&quot;The directors believe that when cash flow from mining is inadequate to meet the full costs of operations and exploration to maintain reserves, it is essential to conserve resources,&quot; the two companies said.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe's Chamber of Mines said earlier this month that the slide in the international bullion price was threatening certain marginal gold mines and that many were operating unprofitably.</p>
<p>However, the price of gold, which has been sliding for several months, rallied towards the end of last week after it set a 3-3/4 year low on February 12 of $336.90 an ounce. Gold fixed last Friday at $353.50 an ounce.</p>
<p>Falcon closed Friday at 1,200 cents per share and Falgold at 60 cents per share. The mining index fell 46.17 points to finish at 882.29 points.</p>
