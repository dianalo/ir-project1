<p>General Motors Corp Chairman Jack Smith on Tuesday said that Saturn Corp last year turned its first profit after debt payments since the GM subsidiary began selling cars in 1990.</p>
<p>&quot;It gets better and better all the time,&quot; Smith said of Saturn's financial performance.</p>
<p>Talking to reporters at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Smith called Saturn a success, although he said it needed to add production capacity.  </p>
<p>&quot;As we look at it today, they're successful. They need to grow, and we have facilities that are available so we want to use those facilities,&quot; Smith said.</p>
<p>Saturn, formed in 1984, has created a niche for itself as an owner-friendly brand where consumers can purchase a car without haggling over the price.</p>
<p>In the past, Saturn has been profitable on an operating basis, but not after the annual amortization of GM's original $5 billion investment.</p>
<p>GM does not break out profit figures for Saturn in its quarterly results.  </p>
<p>At the press conference, Saturn officials also said 76 customers had taken delivery of its new EV1 electric car as of the end of 1996. There were 29 orders that had yet to be delivered, and 469 people have shown various stages of interest in the car, Saturn executives said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have been taken by the depth of interest by buyers,&quot; said Joseph Kennedy, Saturn's head of sales and marketing.</p>
<p>Saturn President Donald Hudler declined to comment on sourcing for the new upscale Innovate sedan now under development, though he said the car would have a high level of North American content. The car is based on the Vectra car from GM's Adam Opel AG unit.</p>
