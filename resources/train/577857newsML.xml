<p>Monday marks more than the 50-day milestone in the countdown to the handover of Hong Kong to China for outgoing Governor Chris Patten -- it's also his 53rd birthday.</p>
<p>But while Patten can start to think about winding down from five turbulent years at the helm of the British colony, another tough week is shaping up for the man who will become chief executive when the Chinese flag rises over Hong Kong on July 1.</p>
<p>Shipping magnate-turned-politician Tung Chee-hwa faces a fresh onslaught over his plans to tighten civil liberties laws.</p>
<p>He is expected to unveil draft replacement laws within days following a three-week public consultation period which yielded more than 4,000 submissions, a Tung spokesman said.</p>
<p>His aides said he is likely to soften some elements but not abandon the changes altogether. These plans include requiring protesters to obtain police permits for demonstrations and outlawing overseas funding for local political parties.</p>
<p>Analysts say concessions are unlikely to mollify his opponents who have protested against the proposals and waged a vigorous battle at home and abroad to press their case.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's pro-democracy camp, which has been itching to challenge in court the China-installed Provisional Legislature set up to replace the elected Legislative Council, may have found an opportunity to do just that.</p>
<p>The provisional chamber met across the border in China on Saturday and passed a minor bill on post-handover public holidays.</p>
<p>The law will not take effect until July 1, but the Democratic Party immediately announced plans to take the China-backed body to court.</p>
<p>&quot;The provisional legislature is an unconstitutional structure and they don't have any legal foundation to pass laws for Hong Kong,&quot; Andrew Cheng, a current legislator and Democratic Party member, said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a tiny but wealthy community of 6.4 million people, returns to China after more than 150 years of British rule and has been guaranteed a high degree of autonomy for 50 years.</p>
<p>Tung has promised to implement China's plans for an evolution towards full democracy over the next decade. But unlike Patten, whose democratic reforms prompted China's plan to dismantle the Legislative Council, Tung is receiving backing from Beijing.</p>
<p>In an unprecedented move, President Jiang Zemin went on Cable News Network last week promising to respect Hong Kong's separate identity and its autonomous legal system.</p>
<p>There's one problem Tung faces that his counterparts in the west would probably envy. What do do with an embarrassment of riches.</p>
<p>Years of windfall surpluses mean Hong Kong enters the momentus changes ahead cushioned by a hefty HK$330 billion ($42 billion) in reserves.</p>
