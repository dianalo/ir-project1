<p>Faustino Asprilla was due to arrive back in Britain on Saturday and will be heading for showdown talks with his Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan.</p>
<p>The Colombian was reported to be booked on a London-bound flight from Bogota.</p>
<p>Keegan, preparing his team for their Engish premier league game at Derby, wants to know why his 7.5 million pounds ($11.81 million) player is two days late.</p>
<p>Asprilla scored Colombia's winner in their World Cup game aganst Ecuador on Wednesday and was expected to return to London immediately after the game.</p>
<p>Bad weather delayed the scheduled flight but he was not on the next available plane.</p>
<p>Keegan said on Friday that he did not know of Asprilla's whereabouts and ruled him out of the Derby game.</p>
<p>Now Keegan must consider whether to include him in the Newcastle squad which leaves for Hungary on Monday for the UEFA Cup game against Ferencvaros on Tuesday.</p>
