<p>TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc said Thursday that Carlton Investments, a partnership composed of former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc executives that is the company's largest minority shareholder, has agreed to withdraw its lawsuit against the company.</p>
<p>The lawsuit had been filed in New York Supreme Court in 1994. The decision to withdraw the lawsuit is part of an overall settlement, TLC said.</p>

<p>TLC said that Carlton also agreed to withdraw its appeal of the settlement approved last month by the Delaware Court of the Chancery of a derivative lawsuit filed by Carlton against TLC Beatrice and the Lewis Estate.</p>
<p>TLC Beatrice distributes dry groceries, beverages and household products in the Paris area. It also makes and markets ice cream in Spain and the Canary Islands,and makes potato chips in Ireland.</p>
