<p>Bulgaria can overcome its grave economic crisis in some two years if radical measures are taken to liberalise the economy and restore confidence in the lev, said former Polish finance minister Leszek Balcerowicz.</p>
<p>Balcerowicz, also known as the architect of a tough shock therapy used to restructure Poland's embattled economy in the early 1990s, was on a two-day visit to Sofia to advise on urgently-needed reforms.</p>
<p>&quot;Eliminating inflation is a matter of months. Once (financial) discipline is imposed and sustained and the economy rapidly privatised, progress can be achieved in a year or two, but the effect will come later,&quot; Balcerowicz told reporters.</p>
<p>Cumulative inflation for the first two months of this year is 392 percent.</p>
<p>He saw restoring confidence in the national currency along with price liberalisation, rapid privatisation and strengthening of institutions as paramount to creating conditions for subsequent economic growth.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that Bulgaria's economic strategy is a sound one and the right one. It is very important once a government is formed to act rapidly and decisively,&quot; he said after meeting President Petar Stoyanov on Friday.</p>
<p>Under a $510 million 14-month IMF standby accord agreed last month, Bulgaria pledged to introduce a fixed exchange rate system known as a currency board in June to restore confidence in its collapsing financial system.</p>
<p>Under the agreement the caretaker government, is expected to make preparations for implementation of the currency board system by the new government and parliament to be formed after the April 19 general elections.</p>
<p>&quot;Once you launch radical reforms and sustain them there will aslo be social costs and it is important to inform the people of the choices...there will be unemployment, but there will also be prospects,&quot; said Balcerowicz.</p>
<p>Bulgaria's jobless are expected to rise by yearend by some 160,000 or to 17.2 percent of the total workforce structural reforms take place, the social wellfare ministry said.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) board is expected to review the cabinet's preparations for the currency board and consider disbursing the first tranche of the standby on April 11.</p>
<p>The system would require levs in circulation to be matched by central bank reserves, severely curbing the financial powers of the government and the central bank and preventing the printing of money.</p>
<p>Balcerowicz, 50, now head of the opposition Union for Freedom (UW), said he would not take a job in Bulgaria but saw it as his moral duty to help.</p>
<p>The liberal Polish economist, as a member of the first Solidarity government after the 1989 fall of communism, launched reforms that overcame hyper-inflation and, removing subsidies to industry, laid the basis for a market economy.</p>
<p>Unlike Bulgaria, which delayed fundamental reforms for seven years, Poland is now enjoying one of the highest economic growth rates in Europe although many Poles recall the first reforms as a frightening time of hardship in which real incomes dropped and unemployment rose sharply.</p>
