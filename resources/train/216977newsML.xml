<p>Leading Russian shares edged down on Tuesday as overheated prices cooled down, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Papers are slowly reaching the point where they are interesting to buy,&quot; said Alexei Toporkov, a trader from Alliance-Menatep, adding that shares like UES, Rostelekom and Mosenergo were already cheap enough.</p>
<p>He said Western investors would not buy at current levels due to political and economic instability in Russia.</p>
<p>An International Monetary Fund mission left Moscow on Tuesday without making any recommendations as to whether to pay Russia the next tranche of its $10 billion loan.</p>
<p>The communists on Sunday threatened to try and impeach Yeltsin or to call for a no-confidence vote in the government.</p>
<p>&quot;There are several unpleasant issues on the market, first of all the situation with Rostelekom. I think Rostelekom is dragging the whole market down,&quot; said Yevgeny Turok, a trader from UFG.</p>
<p>Russia has dropped London-based investment bank N.M. Rothschild as adviser on the sale of a stake in telecoms holding company AO Svyazinvest, the State Property Committee said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The statement did not say who would take over as adviser.</p>
<p>The Financial Times said on Tuesday that Russia's Alfa-Bank and Most-Bank would handle the sale in future.</p>
<p>The Committee said that, out of a series of options for selling Svyazinvest, the government had decided to transfer its 38 percent stake in Rostelekom to Svyazinvest.</p>
<p>Toporkov said the market's next direction would depend on news on the IMF decision, due to be taken in mid-December.</p>
<p>Yuganskneftegaz fell to $9.70 from $10.25 at Monday's close, Megionneftegaz was $2.33 after $3.37, UES edged down to $0.0822 from $0.0825 and Mosenergo rose to $0.980 from $0.994.</p>
