<title>POLAND: Poland asks Hachette group to improve Ruch offer.</title>
<headline>Poland asks Hachette group to improve Ruch offer.</headline>
<dateline>WARSAW 1997-03-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Polish treasury minister asked the Hachette-led Polish-French investor group to improve its bid for the country's largest newsstand chain Ruch SA after a Polish group submitted a competitive offer last month.  </p>
<p>&quot;Yesterday I sent the consortium led by Hachette a letter setting the deadline for its exclusive rights to negotiate the purchase of Ruch. I asked it to improve the parameters of the offer,&quot; Miroslaw Pietrewicz told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said Hachette could submit an improved offer by 1700 GMT on March 18.</p>
<p>Pietrewicz said that unless he got a better offer from Hachette he would annul the current tender for the Ruch sale and launch a new one, in which a recent bid by a Polish group could be considered. Ruch owns 17,000 kiosks nation-wide and controls 65 percent of Poland's press distribution market.  </p>
<p>Hachette, which signed an initial agreement with the treasury ministry late last year on buying a 75 percent stake in Ruch, has threatened unspecified action against the Polish government if it broke the deal.</p>
<p>But Pietrewicz said his prime concern was to protect interests of the treasury and that the accord with Hachette's consortium, which also groups several Polish press firms, was not legally binding.</p>
<p>He said the offer by a group led by the trading firm Universal, made after the tender for the Ruch privatisation had been closed, bettered Hachette's.  </p>
<p>&quot;The (Polish group's) offer would double revenues to the budget and it estimates Ruch's value is twice as big,&quot; Pietrewicz said.</p>
<p>Universal, whose group also includes the private television Polsat SA and soft drink producer and publisher Multico SA, has offered to pay $80 million for a 40-percent stake in Ruch.</p>
<p>The group also pledged to invest a total of $200 million in the company.</p>
<p>The treasury ministry distanced itself from the agreement with Hachette in January after the French firm revealed to the media the agreed price to be paid for Ruch ahead of signing the final accord.</p>
<p>The daily Nowa Europa quoted Hachette's president Jean-Louis Nachury as saying his company would pay $84 million for a 75 percent stake in Ruch and then earmark a further $45 million for increasing its capital.</p>
<p>The sale of Ruch, which netted 16.2 million zlotys on sales of 2.7 billion zlotys in 1995, to Hachette was strongly advocated by French President Jacques Chirac during his visit to Poland last year.</p>
<p>Some Polish politicians, including Economy Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek, said the failure to clinch a deal with Hachette after months of negotiations, may deter foreing investors from buying state-owned companies.</p>
<p>Treasury Minister Pietrewicz, who replaced the liberal Kaczmarek as the privatisation chief, is known for his cautious stance toward selling state-owned companies, notably to the foreign capital.</p>
