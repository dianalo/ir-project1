<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-12-12</dateline>

<p>U.S. stock index futures fell sharply late in the session after losing ground steadily during the day to end with steep losses and at the bottom of the session ranges.</p>
<p>Futures started the day with sizable gains as the market staged a correction from steep declines on Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, technical weakness and an Atlanta Federal Reserve November diffusion index that was on stronger than anticipated began to weigh on the bond market in late morning and early afternoon trade, which in turn weighed on index futures, traders said.  </p>
<p>Selling by a large U.S. broker, which some traders estimated at as much as 12,000 S&amp;P 500 contracts, then pushed index futures down with greater force as the end of the session approached.</p>
<p>The premium of the March S&amp;P contract over the spot index narrowed during the late drop. Traders said arbitrage sell programs were triggered when the premium of the March contract narrowed to about 5.50 points or less, which put further pressure on cash stocks despite index arbitrage curbs being in place at the New York Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>Technical selling also added to the market's woes as March S&amp;Ps broke below chart support at 744.30, 742.80, 739.00 and 734.55 on the decline.</p>
<p>S&amp;Ps slipped a bit further in after hours trade on GLOBEX, and traders said pressure could resume on Friday.</p>
<p>However, analysts noted that the bull-market upchannel remains intact, with the lower channel line coming in at about 720.00 in March S&amp;Ps today.</p>
<p>After showing resilience early in the face of losses in U.S. indexes, pressure emerged in Nikkei 225 and the contract ended lower.  </p>
<p>At settlement, March S&amp;P 500s were off 11.30 points at 735.25, Russell 2000s eased 3.10 point to 360.00, Value Line futures were off 8.20 point to 675.00, Nikkei 225 index futures eased 105.0 to 20,305.0 and Midcap 400s eased 2.20 point to 252.85.
