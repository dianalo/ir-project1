<p>France's opinion poll watchdog, battling against a tide of banned pre-election surveys, urged legal action to muzzle an Internet site on Friday and called for prosecutions at four newspapers and a radio station.</p>
<p>The official Poll Commission said it would ask the Justice Ministry to launch &quot;appropriate prosecution of all the people responsible&quot; for violating the controversial 1977 law which prohibits publication of voter surveys for a week before polling.</p>
<p>It also said it was exploring whether a publication could be prosecuted simply for printing an Internet address where polling data could be found.</p>
<p>Publication of polls in France has been outlawed since last weekend ahead of the May 25-June 1 National Assembly election, but confidential polls circulate widely and are a major factor driving French financial markets.</p>
<p>Violating the ban, denounced by pollsters as obsolete, carries a fine of up to 500,000 francs ($88,000).</p>
<p>The Commission urged action against the left-leaning Liberation daily for posting several polls on the Internet on Friday, on a page called &quot;Campaign Secrets&quot;, in a test of the reach of French laws into cyberspace.</p>
<p>The watchdog also targeted the daily Le Parisien, the financial daily La Tribune, the France Culture radio station and the La Republique des Pyrenees newspaper for mentioning &quot;secret&quot; polls in print or on the airwaves on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>It did not target any Internet sites compiled outside France or foreign dailies which have carried poll data on the French vote, including Switzerland's La Tribune de Geneve or Britain's Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>The Commission, in a second statement issued later on Friday, said it had asked the Justice Ministry's opinion of whether mere publication of an Internet address carrying polls banned in France amounted to complicity in breaking the law, intended to stop voters being swayed.</p>
<p>&quot;If the reply were affirmative, the Commission would like legal action to ensure respect of the law,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>French media have widely directed the country's 300,000 Internet subscribers towards site displaying polls.</p>
<p>The Republique des Pyrenees, in the south-western town of Pau, openly challenged the law on Friday, publishing a CSA poll along with an editorial entitled &quot;In the name of equality&quot; that denounced the law as hypocritical and outmoded.</p>
<p>Jean-Marcel Bouguereau wrote that confidential polls taken in recent days were available on the Internet and to people like politicians, stockbrokers and journalists while ordinary French citizens were denied access.</p>
<p>Polls taken before the blackout all gave the ruling centre-right at least a narrow lead over the left. The law boosts sales of foreign newspapers like La Tribune de Geneve, available just over the border.</p>
<p>Andre Santini, spokesman for the Union for French Democracy which is the junior partner in the ruling coalition, urged a review of the law. &quot;Technologies have evolved...I wonder if we're in the process of treating the French people like infants,&quot; he told France 3 television.</p>
<p>Similar bans apply in countries like Belgium, Spain and Italy. But Britain, Germany and the United States have no restrictions on polls.</p>
