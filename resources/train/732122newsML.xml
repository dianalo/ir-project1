<p>Argentine stocks were seen staging a comeback Wednesday after slumping the previous session on rumors of an immiment Brazilian devaluation, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will get back into a buying mode following the other stock markets in the region. The big buyers were already taking positions at cheap prices towards the end of the trading on Tuesday,&quot; a stock analyst said.</p>
<p>The blue chip MerVal index tumbled 3.37 percent to 807.91 after closing off 1.7 percent Monday.  </p>
<p>Some traders said that, Brazilian rumors aside, Tuesday's fall was a necessary correction in the Buenos Aires market, which has now lost five percent this week.</p>
<p>&quot;The fears of a Brazilian devaluation were just an excuse and not a cause for the correction in share prices. There's still an expectation of a rising market,&quot; said Adolfo Adorno of Roberto Agra y Compania Sociedad de Bolsa.</p>
<p>He said that the easing of the Brazil fears would also help the market rebound.</p>
<p>Shares in oil firm YPF were seen easing, after 10 percent of its shares were sold at $29.25 each.  </p>
<p>YPF shares closed Tuesday at 30.40 pesos. The 10 percent auctioned previously belonged to the former state-owned firm's employees.</p>
