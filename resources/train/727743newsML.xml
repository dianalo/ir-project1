<p>The Southeast Asian rubber trade was sceptical that the International Natural Rubber Organisation (INRO) will intervene soon in the market while prices are seen heading lower, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>The regional rubber business slowed to a crawl over speculation last Friday that INRO will intervene after its five day indicator price fell below the 'may-buy' level of 183.00 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kg.  </p>
<p>&quot;Based on our past experience, INRO normally won't buy at or slightly below the may-buy level,&quot; a trader in the Thai rubber centre of Hat Yai said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it (INRO) will enter the market when the price is nearer to the must-buy level..I would guess around 175-178 cents,&quot; he added. INRO's must-buy level is 172 cents.</p>
<p>A dealer for a commodity house in Singapore said there is also a question in her mind whether INRO has sufficient funds to intervene in a big way in the market.  </p>
<p>&quot;We need to know if they have the money to intervene. We also don't know if they can do this in a big way by procuring large amounts of rubber,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;INRO may be able to lift the gloom if it is willing to buy big volume. The best we can expect near-term is steady prices,&quot; said a Bangkok-based trader.</p>
<p>The sentiment was echoed in Malaysia although Indonesian dealers were pinning their hopes on INRO.</p>
<p>&quot;Our fate will depend on INRO's decision...because we expect to see something happen,&quot; a dealer in Padang in the province of West Sumatra said.  </p>
<p>Regional rubber prices are expected to remain weak with most of the major consumers in Europe and the United States out for the summer holiday season.</p>
<p>&quot;The market's fundamentals are not optimistic. Production is up and prices look a bit weak,&quot; a dealer in Singapore said.</p>
<p>An Indonesian dealer added: &quot;The sentiment remains bearish as we don't see much buying interest. I think INRO will become the sole buyer because buying interest from elsewhere is almost zero.&quot;  </p>
<p>Japan remained the only major buyer in Thailand, the world's biggest natural rubber producer. But overall demand remained sluggish while Chinese inquiries failed to yield any substantial orders, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Thai benchmark RSS3 for September delivery was quoted on Friday at around 92.00 U.S. cents per kg FOB Bangkok. October was quoted at 94.00 cents on the same basis. Latex was quoted at 70.00-72.00 cents a kg on the same basis, traders said.  </p>
<p>In Indonesia, offer prices were quoted at 43.50 U.S. cents a kg FOB Medan for September shipment, 43.00 cents FOB Padang and Surabaya, 43.25 cents FOB Palembang and 42.75 cents FOB Pontianak and Jambi, dealers said.</p>
<p>Malaysian traders had mixed views if prices could rebound this week. Prices ended firmer on Friday, but not before being bashed through almost the whole of last week by bearish factors.</p>
<p>&quot;There is still no indication of buyers returning to the market in a big way,&quot; a trader said. &quot;The Europeans are having their summer holidays while all others are generally sidelined, so I guess we'll still see some consolidation in prices.&quot;  </p>
<p>The benchmark RSS1 for August buyer was up one cent to 228 Malaysian cents a kg on Friday due to fresh technical support and reports of SMR20 sales to China and Germany, traders said.</p>
<p>The board quoted the SMR20 for August buyer half a cent up at 232.50 cents. But compared to a week ago, RSS1 was down 15 cents while SMR20 fell four cents.</p>
<p>Some traders said prices could strengthen slightly this week. But others said RSS1 could dip by another 10 cents and SMR20 by five cents if sentiment turned bearish again.</p>
