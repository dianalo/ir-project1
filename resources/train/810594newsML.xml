<p>United Parcel Service said late Monday night it had reached a tentative deal with the Teamsters' union to end a 15-day strike that has crippled the delivery of packages throughout the United States.</p>
<p>In a recorded telephone message at its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia, UPS said: &quot;This evening, we reached a tentative agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.&quot;</p>
<p>UPS said that under an agreement with Labor Secretary Alexis Herman, who has been pressing the two sides to make compromises at the negotiating table, no details of the tentative deal would be spelled out before Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>Herman was to formally report the tentative agreement on a contract at a late-night news conference in Washington following marathon talks between the company and the Teamsters.</p>
<p>The strike by 185,000 Teamsters has crippled the world's largest carrier of small packages, costing UPS $650 million so far.</p>
<p>Once final details of a deal were agreed on, the Teamsters could be back on the job within a few days, even though a ratification vote by mail will take up to a month, Cable News Network reported, citing Teamster sources.</p>
<p>The two sides had begun their latest round of talks Thursday at the request of Herman. The talks continued with only brief breaks for sleep until late Sunday night, when they adjourned for 12 hours, before resuming Monday at noon.</p>
<p>On Sunday, President Clinton had said he had a &quot;gut feeling&quot; that UPS and the Teamsters would settle. &quot;They're that close,&quot; he said, holding up two fingers not very far apart.</p>
<p>The strike was the largest in the United States since a three-day 1976 strike by 400,000 Teamster truck drivers, according to Cornell University labor studies professor Richard Hurd.</p>
