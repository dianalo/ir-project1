<p>French President Jacques Chirac on Wednesday reassured former African colonies that their CFA currency, linked to the French franc, would not suffer from the creation of the single European currency in 1999.</p>
<p>Chirac's spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said he told leaders of French-speaking African states in Ouagadougou that worries about a new devaluation of the CFA franc were unfounded.</p>
<p>He told them that article 109 of the Maastricht Treaty creating the European Monetary Union allowed special links between currencies to remain after the Euro currency comes into effect.</p>
<p>He said the parity between the French and CFA francs would be substituted by a new parity with the Euro, but the value of the west African currency would not be affected.</p>
<p>Colonna said Chirac had pledged to write personally to the leaders of CFA countries to reassure them.</p>
<p>The issue was prominent in opening talks to the 19th Franco-African summit in the capital of Burkina Fasso.</p>
<p>The CFA franc links the currencies of 14 African countries with the franc, and the proposed European currency had raised concern of a new blow following a massive 50 percent devaluation in 1994, the first change in parity since 1948.</p>
<p>The devaluation forced many governments to adopt economic rigour to avoid worsening poverty.</p>
<p>The current parity is 100 CFA francs for one French franc.</p>
<p>Leaders of 19 French-speaking African countries attended Wednesday's talks, a prelude to a fully-fledged Franco-African summit of nearly 50 countries on Thursday.</p>
<p>The summit is expected to issue a final statement insisting on democratic government and sound economic management as the keys to stability and development.</p>
<p>Central African President Ange Patasse, facing his third army mutiny this year, stayed away and sent his foreign minister. Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, convalescing from cancer surgery on the French Riviera, was represented by Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo.</p>
<p>Host President Blaise Compaore voiced concern about the situation in the Central African Republic and called for suggestions on how to deal with the mutiny.</p>
<p>Colonna said the opening talks steered clear of the turmoil in the Great Lakes region, but Ivory Coast President Konan Bedie repeated the need for an African peace force which would act on recommendations from the Organisation of African Unity or the United Nations.</p>
<p>Proposals made at the last Franco-African summit two years ago for dedicated military units appeared impractical, and Bedie suggested that units from various countries train together in order to be able to go rapidly into action.</p>
