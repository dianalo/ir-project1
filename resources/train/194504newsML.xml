<headline>PACCAR COMPLETES TAKEOVER OF DAF TRUCKS.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-11-14</dateline>

<p>U.S truck-maker Paccar Inc. has completed its friendly 933 million guilder takeover of the Netherlands' DAF Trucks NV, by acquiring 100 percent of the shares, DAF Trucks said on Friday.    </p>
<p>The deal consolidates Paccar's position as the world's third biggest producer of heavy trucks with annual sales of $6.3 billion based on the combined 1995 figures of DAF and Paccar.</p>
<p>In the United States Paccar makes Peterbilt and Kenworth trucks and in Europe it has now added DAF to its Foden trucks business in Britain.    </p>
<p>DAF Trucks chairman Cor Baan said the Paccar takeover would help further strengthen confidence in the Dutch company which was relaunched after being declared bankrupt in 1993.</p>
<p>&quot;Cooperation in a broader framework under the protective umbrella of Paccar Inc. gives DAF Trucks the opportunity to develop and grow further,&quot; he said.    </p>
<p>Paccar and DAF jointly announced the friendly takeover bid on October 7, saying it was backed by DAF's two main management organs, the executive board and the supervisory board.</p>
<p>The deal appears to set the seal on DAF's recovery, following the bankruptcy of the old DAF NV in February 1993.</p>
<p>The old DAF acquired the British Leyland commercial vehicles business in 1987 but was forced into bankruptcy six years later as a result of mounting losses and crippling debts.</p>
<p>The British operations were sold off and a new company, with the Dutch and Flemish governments as major shareholders, was set up to continue DAF's core heavy trucks business.    </p>
<p>The new DAF Trucks NV, with a smaller labour force and working strictly to customer orders, gradually clawed its way back to profitability.</p>
<p>DAF made a net profit of 164 million guilders on sales of 2.9 billion guilders in 1995, producing over 16,600 trucks.</p>
<p>In the same year Paccar made a net profit of $253 million on sales of $4.6 billion and produced over 54,000 trucks.</p>
<p>Paccar said last month it expected DAF immediately to make a positive contribution to earnings, adding that its cost structure was among the lowest in Europe.</p>
