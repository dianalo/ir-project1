<p>Naphtha prices went higher for the third consecutive day on Thursday, supported by overnight crude gains as well as the firm European market, trader said.</p>
<p>Open-specification naphtha for first-half March was assessed at $251.00/253.00, up from late Wednesday's $250.00/251.00.</p>
<p>Second-half March was quoted at $248.00/250.00. It was sold at $247.50 to a Japanese trading house in Wednesday evening trading.</p>
<p>In naphtha spreads, second-half March/first-half May was discussed at around plus $7.50.  </p>
<p>In physical naphtha trading, a petrochemical firm affiliated with a refiner was rumoured to have bought a first-half February cargo at plus $6.00 to $7.00 over the mean of Japanese quotes.</p>
<p>Other than this firm, most petrochemical end-users remained sidelined due to higher naphtha prices.</p>
<p>So far, three Japanese petrochemical firms said they plan to cut naphtha purchases because of skyrocketing import costs. In the low sulphur waxy residue market, Indonesian cargoes were talked at about $1.00 over the Pertamina formula for January delivery. --Tokyo Energy Desk +81-3-3432-8837</p>
