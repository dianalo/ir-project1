<title>NORWAY: Oslo shares underpinned by high oil price.</title>
<headline>Oslo shares underpinned by high oil price.</headline>
<dateline>OSLO 1996-09-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Norwegian shares closed moderately higher on Monday, with higher oil prices giving some support to the market. Besides the favourable oil price, there were few factors to trade on, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems like investors are a bit uncertain which sectors to invest in at the moment,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>The Total share index closed 0.5 percent up at 826.7 points in turnover worth 354 million crowns.</p>
<p>Industrial heavyweight Norsk Hydro rose one crown, closing at 295.5 crowns. One dealer attributed this to the jump in oil prices.  </p>
<p>&quot;But with an oil price above $22, I'm a bit disappointed that Hydro hasn't shined more than this,&quot; said the dealer.</p>
<p>Oil company Fountain Oil, which is also traded on the Nasdaq, was one of the session's winners, rising 0.80 crowns to 41.90 crowns. Players said several major broker houses had recommended a buy on the share.</p>
<p>Broker house Fokus Fonds in a market forecast said it expected Fountain's share price to double within one year.</p>
