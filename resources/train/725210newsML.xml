<p>Shares wafted in thin trade to</p>
<p>a new all-time high close on the main indices on Monday, with</p>
<p>the strong dollar helping Nokia and forestries and financials</p>
<p>adding a push on an otherwise mixed market, brokers said.</p>
<p>The FOX index gained 0.88 percent to a life-high 1,172.31,</p>
<p>scraping past its previous July 9 peak by four points, while the</p>
<p>all-share HEX rose 0.97 percent to a record 3,417.01 points. The</p>
<p>459 million markka volume was meagre against recent levels.</p>
<p>&quot;This looks fairly strong, but it all depends on how the</p>
<p>U.S. market performs,&quot; one broker said, while others said a</p>
<p>higher open on Wall Street for Nokia pointed to further upside.</p>
<p>With many domestic operators on summer holiday, brokers</p>
<p>said a scarcity of sellers in combination with a normal level</p>
<p>of overseas demand drove prices higher.</p>
<p>Nokia closed 9.20 markka higher at 428.20, coming off an</p>
<p>intraday high of 431.00 which was just a few markka short of its</p>
<p>all-time high 433.00 set last week.</p>
<p>Nokia's two shares together added more than five points to</p>
<p>the FOX index's 10 point gains.</p>
<p>The dollar-markka exchange rate punched briefly through 5.3</p>
<p>and helped Nokia and forestries, in particular, brokers said.</p>
<p>UPM-Kymmene closed 0.50 higher at 135.00 in fair volume.</p>
<p>Enso gained 0.40 markka to 50.90, stopping just</p>
<p>short of its 51.00 all-time high.</p>
<p>Pulp prices seemed to be firming, and a strike that began</p>
<p>Monday at major Canadian producer Fletcher Challenge </p>
<p>could support prices further by curbing supply, brokers said.</p>
<p>Finnish pulp derivatives exchange SOPI put the price of</p>
<p>northern bleached softwood pulp at $573.88 per tonne, up from</p>
<p>$572.30 last week.</p>
<p>Merita rose 0.40 markka to end at 20.30 after touching an</p>
<p>all-time high 20.40 in sturdy 28 million markka volume. It was</p>
<p>the first time the stock closed above 20.00 markka.</p>
<p>Software and data services group TT Tieto rose sharply in</p>
<p>brisk overseas and domestic demand, brokers said. It rose 32.00</p>
<p>markka, or more than seven percent, to 470.00, just one markka</p>
<p>off its all-time high 471.00.</p>
<p>Brokers said TT Tieto mirrored strength in Swedish software</p>
<p>maker WM-Data , though they said there did not seem to</p>
<p>be concrete connection between the gains in the two shares.</p>
<p>&quot;The (data processing) sector has risen in Sweden, and</p>
<p>that's reflected here,&quot; one broker said. Others pointed to</p>
<p>recent gains in U.S. technology stocks as a possible explanation</p>
<p>for TT's rise.</p>
