<p>Japanese carmaker Mazda, as part of a struggle to drag itself out of a slump, on Monday launched a stylish station wagon at a comparatively low price to lure young customers away from its bigger rivals.</p>
<p>The Demio, geared to young families, resembles a mini-van and is powered by a 1.3 or 1.5-litre engine.</p>
<p>It was launched amid fanfare attended by Mazda's new president, Henry Wallace, who is the first foreigner to head a major Japanese company.</p>
<p>&quot;The Demio is flexible, fun to drive, easy to drive in the city but roomy, and great value,&quot; Wallace told Japanese reporters at a press preview.</p>
<p>Wallace's celebrity status in Japan was marked by Mazda's decision to feature him in full-page advertisements in Japanese newspapers last week.</p>
<p>The Demio will be priced from below 800,000 yen ($7,407), Wallace said. The domestic price will start at 798,000 yen ($7,388) for the 1.3-litre model with a five-speed manual gearbox and no air-conditioner.</p>
<p>The cheapest car on the domestic market with a 1.3-litre engine is not a recreational vehicle but Toyota Motor's Starlet three-door hatchback with a price tag of 730,000 yen ($6,759) without an air conditioner.</p>
<p>Other makers have an array of recreational vehicles and Mazda itself also has several recreational vehicles such as the Bongo Friendee camper, MPV minivan, and Capella station wagon.</p>
<p>But Mazda maintains that none quite matches the shape and style of the Demio. It said the vehicle's name is derived from the Spanish &quot;de mio&quot; meaning &quot;mine&quot;.</p>
<p>Daihatsu Motor, an affiliate of Toyota, is due to launch on August 28 the 1.5-litre Pyzer recreational vehicle, which is slightly bigger than the Demio.</p>
<p>The Demio is equipped with driver's side air bag and anti-lock brake system as standard.</p>
<p>&quot;The sales target for the Demio is 4,000 a month. However, for initial sales, we are planning 5,000,&quot; Wallace said.</p>
<p>Wallace said Mazda aims to provide a higher degree of customer satisfaction, which the Demio will provide. This is the top priority, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The Demio, which is introduced today, is the very first example of the new Mazda corporate direction,&quot; Wallace said.</p>
<p>He said sales were weaker than planned, but overall the company was still comfortable with the full-year projection because of the weaker yen.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still projecting net profit of 20 billion yen ($185 million), unchanged (from an earlier estimate).&quot;</p>
<p>Mazda posted net profit of just 300 million yen ($2.7 million) in the last business year after posting a net loss of 35.70 billion yen ($330 million) the year before. In May, Mazda had forecast parent net profit of 20 billion yen ($185 million) in this business year.</p>
<p>Mazda plans to start exporting the new Demio in October at a rate of 500 per month to Australia and other Asian countries. It will not introduce the model in the United States because it is not a compact-vehicle market, Wallace said.</p>
<p>Nikko Research analyst Tsunemi Tachibana said: &quot;Sales of the Demio are likely to be tough because several makers are expected to launch similar models. The weak point of the Demio is that it has no four-wheel-drive version.&quot; ($1=108 yen)</p>
