<p>-- BONN MINISTER ATTACKS 'UNFAIR' EU TAX HAVENS</p>
<p>Jurgen Stark, a state secretary at Germany's finance ministry, has said that Bonn is planning a campaign against 'tax havens' in the European Union as part of a strategy aimed at stamping out what it sees as unfair tax practices which apparently favour foreign financial centres. Stark was particularly critical of the UK, but also spoke out against tax regimes in Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>
<p>-- NATWEST SUSPENDS STAFF IN NORWICH UNION FLOAT PROBE</p>
<p>National Westminster Bank has suspended 18 staff on suspicion they attempted to cash in on the floatation of Norwich Union. The staff are alleged to have backdated policies to make them eligible for windfall bonuses of about 500 stg each following the 4 billion stg floatation. The Personal Investment Authority, the regulator for the private investor, is investigating a number of allegedly fraudulent attempts to benefit from the Norwich Union floatation.</p>
<p>-- NORTHERN ELECTRIC'S FATE HINGES ON APPEAL OUTCOME</p>
<p>The fate of the 782 million stg hostile bid by US utility CalEnergy for UK regional electricity company Northern Electric is now likely to rest with an expected appeal to the Takeover Panel. The Panel, the City's takeover watchdog, ruled at the weekend to extend the deadline for the bid after it was revealed that BZW, advisers to Northern, charged an extra fee of 250,000 stg to its client for buying shares as part of its defence strategy. Now Northern is expected to lodge an appeal against the Panel's decision.</p>
<p>-- MILLENNIUM CUTS AIM TO WIN ALL-PARTY SUPPORT</p>
<p>Millennium Central, the company organising the Millennium Exhibition in Greenwich, London, is to slash up to 150 million stg from its budget in an attempt to win support for the project from the Labour party. Labour has said it will support the Greenwich project 'when the budget is under strict control', and Millennium Central is hoping that a reduction of 150 million stg from the 700 million stg budget will sway the opposition.</p>
<p>-- LABOUR MAY SHELVE MERGER OF OFT AND MMC</p>
<p>The Labour Party may be about to relax its plans to merge competition watchdogs the Office of Fair Trading and the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Shadow ministers are reported to have expressed misgivings that the proposals would increase costs in the short-term for little apparent gain. Labour's intention was to streamline the organisation of the competition authorities, and to create a new body with more powers.</p>
<p>-- LIFT TRUCK DEMAND 'TO REMAIN HIGH'</p>
<p>The British Industrial Truck Association, the organisation representing the main industry players in the UK lift truck sector, has predicted that demand for lift trucks in the UK will remain high during 1997. The Association predicts sales of lift trucks in the UK will remain at about 23,000 units, the figure for the last two years.</p>
<p>-- TWO PREDATORS STALKED WH SMITH</p>
<p>Two major British retail groups have considered, and then rejected, takeover bids for high street retailer WH Smith. The bids are reported to have been considered in the past six months by pharmacy and healthcare group Boots and by an unnamed large UK supermarket group. It is understood the bids would have valued WH Smith at over 2 billion stg.</p>
<p>-- APPLE'S PRODIGAL SON RETURNS AFTER NeXT ACQUISITION</p>
<p>Steve Jobs, one of the founders of Apple Computer, has returned to the company after it was announced that Apple is to acquire NeXT Software, the company Jobs formed after leaving Apple 11 years ago. As well as acquiring new technology enabling it to rejuvenate its aging Macintosh software, the $400 million (239.5 million stg) deal will also see Jobs take a part-time role as product strategy adviser to Apple.</p>
<p>-- INVESTOR TEAM AIMS TO BUY WELCOME BREAK</p>
<p>A team of venture capital investors, led by the former chairman of restaurant chain BrightReasons, is seeking to buy Granada Group's motorway service chain Welcome Break. The 21 motorway service areas must by sold by Granada after an instruction from the Department of Trade and Industry. Whitbread, the brewer and leisure group, and property group Heron International, are also understood to be interested in Welcome, which has been estimated by anaysts to be worth at least 300 million stg.</p>
<p>-- KEADBY SALE DUE IN NEW YEAR</p>
<p>Scottish Hydro Electric hopes to complete the purchase from United Utilities of the remaining 50 per cent it does not own in Keadby power station. Hydro Electric is the preferred bidder for the plant, which could cost it up to 250 million stg, and United Utilities has said it sees 'no significant problems' to completing the deal shortly after Christmas.
