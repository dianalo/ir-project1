<title>CROATIA: Croatian stocks close higher, further gains seen.</title>
<headline>Croatian stocks close higher, further gains seen.</headline>
<dateline>ZAGREB 1997-08-04</dateline>

<p>Most Croatian stocks resumed growth on Wednesday after Tuesday's public holiday, with blue chips breaking records in heavy trade.</p>
<p>Traders predicted further gains on the back of strong investor interest which comes in spite of the traditionally quieter holiday season.</p>
<p>&quot;The growth trend should last at least until the end of this week,&quot; said one trader with a large foreign client base.</p>
<p>Drugs firm Pliva, selling 5,699 shares, was the most active issue. It firmed 18 kuna to close at a new all-time high of 584.</p>
<p>Zagrebacka Banka climbed 150 kuna to 2,500 -- also a record -- with 4,016 a total of units sold.</p>
<p>&quot;Pliva and Zagrebacka did just great today. They led the whole market up and jointly accounted for almost the entire turnover,&quot; said Danijel Nevidal of CAIB, Austria's Credianstalt investment bank unit in Croatia.</p>
<p>He traced the developments to a rise in both blue chips' Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) earlier today, saying growth in Zagreb could go on if the upward trend in London continues.</p>
<p>Zagrebacka's, issued at 10 of each share, rose to a record $38.125 on Seaq International with a spread of 1.57 percent over the Zagreb price.</p>
<p>Pliva's 1/5 GDRs fetched $17.6, compared to $17.5 at close on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Apart from these two, seven other of 18 active issues also rose in Zagreb on Wednesday, four fell and five ended flat.</p>
<p>Volume rose to 25,230 from last Friday's 9,898 shares, turnover was almost four times higher at 18.6 million kuna after trade quickened just before close at 1200 GMT.</p>
<p>The bourse was closed for Thanksgiving on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Varazdinska Banka ordinary shares rose 11 kuna to 250 on volume of 5,471. Its B-series preferred stock led gainers, adding 20 kuna or 13.3 percent to close at 170 kuna.</p>
<p>Food processor Podravka continued its recovery to close four kuna higher at 269 kuna with 5,479 shares sold.</p>
<p>&quot;Podravka is quite liquid but we don't expect to see it rise much above 270 kuna, maybe a kuna or two,&quot; Nevidal said.</p>
<p>He said there was room for further growth of hotelier Laguna, which climbed 18 kuna to 1,468 with 576 shares sold.</p>
<p>The biggest loser was ship repairer Viktor Lenac which shed 10 kuna or 6.25 percent to 150 kuna, selling 270 units.</p>
