<title>SPAIN: Three bombs explode on beaches in eastern Spain.</title>

<p>Three bombs exploded on Wednesday on beaches along Spain's northeastern coast, causing no damage or injury, Catalonia region officials said.</p>
<p>Two bombs went off at 8.00 a.m. and 8.30 a.m. while leaders of the NATO military alliance were meeting in Madrid more than 600 km (375 miles) away.</p>
<p>A third bomb was set off by police at 10.30 a.m. after they searched Lloret de Mar beaches along the coast north of Barcelona.</p>
<p>Officials did not say whether Basque separatist rebels ETA were responsible, but the group often sets off small bombs at tourist sites during the summer season.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, police evacuated 15,000 sunbathers from Lloret de Mar beaches after a caller in the name of ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) warned that the group had planted a bomb.</p>
<p>Security in Madrid was at a maximum because of fears of an attack by the separatist group during the two-day NATO summit.</p>
<p>ETA has killed some 800 people during its nearly 30-year campaign for an independent Basque state, including senior public figures assassinated in the heart of Madrid and other cities.</p>
<p>Last July, ETA planted bombs almost daily at tourist sites across the country. A blast at an airport near an eastern resort town injured 35 people, mostly British tourists.</p>
<p>Officials said the three bombs on Wednesday had been planted some 50 metres (yards) from the sea on stretches of unpopulated coastline to the south of Lloret de Mar. One had been placed in a beach bag.</p>
