<p>Corsican separatists fired an anti-tank rocket into gendarmerie barracks on the French Mediterranean island early on Saturday in an attack that authorities called &quot;an act of war&quot;.</p>
<p>Police said the rocket, fired from a distance of about 150 metres (yards), pierced the armoured gate and a wall of the Porto-Vecchio barracks, ending up in a bedroom where two members of the paramilitary police were asleep.</p>
<p>They suffered shock and eardrum injuries.</p>
<p>Police said the rocket's warhead had not exploded and they were trying to determine if it was faulty or if the attackers had defused it to minimise injuries.</p>
<p>&quot;This is an act of war carried out in peacetime...All means will be used to unmask those responsible and bring them to justice,&quot; police chief Gerard Bougrier told reporters.</p>
<p>The &quot;Historic Wing&quot; of the outlawed Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC) claimed responsibility in a brief statement for the Porto-Vecchio attack and the machine-gunning of another gendamerie barracks in Bonifacio earlier this week.</p>
<p>(Corrects location of attack earlier this week)</p>
<p>The group, the most hardline of Corsican guerrillas, has also said it carried out a recent spate of bomb attacks in mainland France, including against the mayoral office of Prime Minister Alain Juppe in Bordeaux.</p>
<p>Some 30 bullets were fired earlier this week at the Bonifacio barracks, whose gendarmes took part in swoops on Corsicans suspected of helping in the Bordeaux attack.</p>
<p>All but two of the 12 seized by police were later cleared of suspicion in the October 5 attack on the Bordeaux city hall.</p>
<p>The two were transferred to Paris where an anti-terrorism magistrate was expected to open a formal investigation against them on Sunday or Monday.</p>
<p>They were named as Jean-Jacques Cantara, seized in Bonifacio on the southern tip of Corsica, and his brother Jacques-Marie Cantara, arrested in Marseille in southern mainland France.</p>
<p>Five women detained in Thursday's police swoops were freed within hours. Justice sources said two men held in Bordeaux were released on Friday night. Three others remained in custody, partly on suspicion of illegal possession of weapons.</p>
<p>Juppe has vowed to crack down on two decades of separatist guerrilla violence on Corsica after attacks spilled over on to the French mainland.</p>
