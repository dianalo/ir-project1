<headline>Cambodia's Sihanouk says new PM a &quot;puppet&quot;.</headline>
<dateline>PHNOM PENH 1997-08-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>King Norodom Sihanouk said Cambodia's new first premier was a &quot;puppet&quot; and added he would not be a player in his country's political &quot;comedy&quot; because his views differed radically from those of the people in power.</p>
<p>He said he was powerless to intervene and he still regarded his ousted son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, as a legitimate prime minister.</p>
<p>The king, in a message to a leader of the Cambodian opposition, Sam Rainsy, said he did not want to take any responsibility for political decisions in Cambodia and that was why he had authorised acting head of state Chea Sim to sign all laws and decrees.</p>
<p>&quot;I presently suffer morally a great deal as much as the innocent people of our country,&quot; the king said in his letter to Rainsy, a former finance minister.</p>
<p>Rainsy, a political ally of the ousted Ranariddh, is in Bangkok where he translated the king's message from the Cambodian language and made a copy available to Reuters on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;The fate of our nation is terribly sad: as for me I have no ability to do anything,&quot; Sihanouk, a constitutional monarch, said in his letter from Beijing where he is receiving medical treatment.</p>
<p>&quot;The power is totally in their hands,&quot; he said of government leaders in Phnom Penh. &quot;Their views are totally different from mine. I have no possibility to make them follow my way.&quot;</p>
<p>The Cambodian constitution requires that the king approve a new first prime minister but Sihanouk authorised Chea Sim to appoint Foreign Minister Ung Huot first premier in place of Ranariddh on Thursday.</p>
<p>Ranariddh was overthrown on July 6 by his coalition partner, Second Prime Minister Hun Sen.</p>
<p>Sihanouk also said Ung Huot was a &quot;puppet&quot; and he still regarded Ranariddh as a legitimate premier, the British Broadcasting Corporation reported, citing additional comments released by Sihanouk in Beijing.</p>
<p>Sihanouk was apparently suggesting that Ung Huot will not be able to act without the consent of the powerful Hun Sen who supported Ung Huot's nomination to replace the ousted prince.</p>
<p>Ung Huot was not available for comment on Saturday.</p>
<p>In his message to Sam Rainsy Sihanouk said he delegated authority to Chea Sim because he did not want to be responsible for any decisions made in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>&quot;If I give (Mr) Chea Sim the authorisation to sign all laws and decrees in my place, it is to make him responsible for the people and before history,&quot; Sihanouk said in the letter, dated Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;I must not share this responsibility with him nor with (Mr) Hun Sen. If I share this responsibility ...it would mean I associate myself with these people in the ongoing new political game.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I just cannot take part in this new comedy involving the state,&quot; he said. &quot;History will render justice to each one of us.&quot;</p>
<p>Hun Sen, Ung Huot and Chea Sim are due to travel to Beijing on Monday for a meeting with Sihanouk.</p>
<p>Ranariddh and the former leader of the Vietnamese-backed government in Phnom Penh, Hun Sen, formed their power-sharing alliance in 1993 after U.N.-supervised elections which Ranariddh won.</p>
