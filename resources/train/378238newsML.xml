<p>Helped by a drop on Wall Street, Brazilian stocks ended lower on Friday after posting moderate gains earlier in the last session before Monday's options settlement, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Bovespa index  .BVSP of the 49 most active shares fell 0.74 percent, closing at 87,000 points. For a second day in a row, market turnover was higher than usual, reaching 1.214 billion reais ($1.16 billion), of which 207.8 million reais referred to options which were exercised.  </p>
<p>Traders said heavy trade was also due to deals involving large lots of bellwether Telebras, the underlying stock for the most traded options, which seesawed to close off 1.89 percent at 98.70 reais after hitting 101.15 reais during the session.</p>
<p>Telebras' performance today diminished the chances for the firm's options at 100 reais strike price be exercised Monday but some traders noted that anything can happen on the settlement day, which means that players may be forced to rush to the market to cover positions.  </p>
<p>Most brokers are sure that Telebras options with strike prices of up to 96 reais will be totally exercised.</p>
<p>Because of the options expiry, market turnover is expected to surpass $2.0 billion Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>Other top blue-chips performed slightly better than Telebras. State oil firm Petrobras ended flat at 221.99 reais, while state mining conglomerate Companhia Vale do Rio Doce gained 1.89 percent to 27 reais.  </p>
<p>Sao Paulo bourse's power sector index made up of the nine most liquid stocks of the electrical sector, fell 1.2 percent to 2,491 reais, with federal Eletrobras leading the drop by losing 1.27 percent to 466 reais.</p>
