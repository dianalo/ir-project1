<title>KENYA: Kenya suspends coffee auctions due to shortages.</title>

<p>Kenya has suspended its weekly coffee export auctions because of acute shortages, a senior official at the Kenya Coffee Auctions Ltd said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is simple. There is no coffee. Like cars or batteries, if you have nothing to sell, you sell nothing,&quot; the official told Reuters in Nairobi. He said it was not known when the coffee supply situation would improve.  </p>
<p>Industry officials said that drought that ravaged most growing areas of East Africa from October last year and persisted to March had forced a severe cut in coffee production and coffee reaching the market from farmers was well below earlier predictions.</p>
<p>They added that Kenya had pushed through the auctions as much coffee as it had while global prices for its mild arabicas were high and this had left it with a very tight supply equation.</p>
<p>The Kenya Coffee Auctions Ltd official said that auctions would probably resume in the last week of the month if there was sufficient coffee for an auction. After that, Kenya would auction coffee twice a month &quot;depending on whether we get any&quot;.</p>
<p>The Auctions official did not give new estimates for the final 1996/97 crop or fresh forecasts for 1997/98. The Coffee Board of Kenya has previously said 1996/97 production will be around 80,000 tonnes compared to 97,575 in 1995/96 and 95,806 tonnes in 1994/95. Independent coffee consultants have put 1996/97 production at just around 70-75,000 tonnes.</p>
