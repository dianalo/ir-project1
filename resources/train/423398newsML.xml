<p>British Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine, warming up for an impending election, on Thursday launched an attack on the opposition Labour Party's spending plans.</p>
<p>In a rousing speech to parliament, Heseltine repeated accusations that Labour had made 30 billion pounds ($48.4 billion) worth of spending pledges, a claim dismissed by Labour as a &quot;pack of lies.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;By our calculation, there has been 30 billion pounds of these pledges. Not one has been renounced,&quot; he said. &quot;They never answer the question, where is the money coming from?&quot;</p>
<p>Elections are due by May and the Labour Party, up to 20 points ahead in the opinion polls, is hot favourite to regain power for the first time since 1979.</p>
<p>Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown has promised to stick to Conservative spending plans for the first two years of a Labour government. He has also pledged not to raise income tax in the life of the next government.</p>
<p>Heseltine said those pledges would be so restricting that Brown would resort &quot;to the oldest trick in the book&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;He will have an audit (of the public finance books) and five minutes later say, &quot;I never knew things were so bad&quot;,&quot; Heseltine said. &quot;But the fact is the books are open.&quot;</p>
<p>Deputy Labour leader John Prescott dismissed Heseltine's speech as electioneering.</p>
<p>&quot;18 years of Tory government has ruined the public finances,&quot; he said. &quot;We're not sure about the full extent of the damage yet or whether we are out of the woods.&quot;</p>
<p>He said high unemployment had inflated public spending as welfare costs spiralled. &quot;Our argument is that after 18 years there can be no excuses. The responsibility relies fairly and squarely with this Tory government.&quot;</p>
<p>Heseltine said if Labour accepted the government's spending plans for the next two years, it would have to embrace the Private Finance Initiative and other proposals such as the privatisation of London Underground -- the capital's underground train network, known as the Tube.</p>
<p>Labour has said it would not privatise the Tube. &quot;Public control of the system is the only way to guarantee the future of services and fares,&quot; Shadow Transport Secretary Andrew Smith has told Reuters.</p>
<p>Heseltine questioned Labour's proposal to finance house building by releasing local authority funds.</p>
<p>Poorer, inner city authorities have smaller or no receipts in reserve, he said, adding: &quot;You've got the wrong policy with the wrong targets.&quot;</p>
<p>He also criticised Labour plans for a proposed windfall tax on privatised utilities. Labour has said it would use billions of pounds raised from this to help the young and long-term unemployed back into work by paying employers to take them on.</p>
<p>&quot;Paying billions of pounds in subsidies to employers to take people off benefit for a couple of years...is a retrograde step and destructive of British competitiveness,&quot; Heseltine said.</p>
<p>&quot;And what happens when the money runs out? It's supposed to be a one-off, a windfall.&quot;</p>
<p>Prescott, in turn, attacked the government's record after 18 years of government, dismissing their claims that Britain has the best performing economy in Europe.</p>
<p>He said official figures showed Britain remained ninth out of 15 in the European prosperity league, adding: &quot;The U.K. remains in the relegation zone.&quot;</p>
