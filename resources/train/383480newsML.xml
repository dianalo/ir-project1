<p>An Algerian army offensive using helicopters and ground troops in the rugged northeastern region of Tamesguida killed more than 60 Moslem rebels, an Algerian newspaper said on Monday.</p>
<p>Army helicopters fired at guerrillas holed up in hilly forest 65 km (40 miles) southwest of Algiers and troops moved in at the weekend to kill more than 60 rebels in their hideouts, said Liberte newspaper.</p>
<p>Tamesguida is a stronghold of Moslem guerrillas in Medea province. Rebels stormed an army barracks in Tamesguida in 1993 killing at least 22 soldiers by cutting their throats. Rebels also slaughtered 12 Croatian workers there the same year.</p>
<p>Liberte said the operation was part of an offensive to wipe out guerrillas the authorities blame for killing more than 300 people in Algiers and neighbouring towns and villages in the past month.</p>
<p>Security forces killed seven guerrillas on Friday when they stormed a rebel hideout in Cherarba, 40 km (25 miles) south of Algiers, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>More than 170 guerrillas have been killed, according to Algerian newspaper reports, since President Liamine Zeroual on January 24 vowed to wipe out guerrillas.</p>
<p>About 60,000 people have been killed in Algeria's violence since early 1992 when authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead.</p>
