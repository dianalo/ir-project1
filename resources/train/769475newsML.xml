<headline>U.S. Spring/White Wheat - Bids firm, selling slow.</headline>

<p>Bids for dark northern spring wheat were mostly higher on Thursday but movement was slow ahead of harvest, several cash grain dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we'll start to see some test cutting and a little new crop coming in next week out of southern Minnesota and South Dakota,&quot; a Minnesota dealer said. &quot;It's ripening a little quicker than we thought it would. I think this dry weather has helped.&quot;</p>
<p>Reports from the annual Wheat Quality Council suggested yields would be lower this year. The tour wrapped up in Fargo, North Dakota on Thursday.</p>
<p>The tour pegged spring wheat yield potential at 31.3 bushels per acre, below last year's tour estimate of 36.4 bushels. They put durum at 27.7 bushels per acre, against 29.7 last year.</p>
<p>&quot;The spring wheat number is right in line with what we were thinking here,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;The durum seems a little on the high side. We were looking for (less than) 25.&quot;</p>
<p>Tour participants said the below-average yields were partly a result of an early-summer drought that cause erratic plant emergence, weed and disease pressure. Scab infestation in the Red River Valley was also cited.  </p>
