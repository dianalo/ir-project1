<p>The risk of accelerating inflation is less dangerous than the risk that unemployment stays high for many years, SAK chief economist Pertti Parmanne was quoted as saying in daily Demari on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;In my opinion, it would be better to take the risk that inflation will accelerate as a result of lose economic policy than that we take for many years the continuing risk that unemployment is not brought under control,&quot; Parmanne said.</p>
<p>The Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions (SAK) is an influential umbrella for branch unions representing some 1.1 million mainly blue-collar workers.</p>
<p>Parmanne said the &quot;priesthood&quot; of European central bankers was focussing on expurgating the inflation devil, which he said did not exist in Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;The emphasis of economic policies has clearly gone astray in this respect. While the problem is unemployment, inflation is being chased,&quot; Parmanne was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>He agreed with the need to adjust to an environment of low inflation, but said deflation was a real threat due to excessively tight monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be a terrible situation for the financial markets and from the point of view of the banking crisis if we were heading towards deflation,&quot; Parmanne said.</p>
<p>Three percentage points too low inflation was more dangerous than three percentage points too high inflation, he said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Finland had been fighting nonexistent inflation for many years, Parmanne said, calling for looser monetary policy. Nominal interest rates should be lowered to bring excessively high real interest rates lower, he said.</p>
<p>Economic growth was too slow to cure unemployment because both budget and monetary policies were too tight, he said.</p>
<p>In the same Demari article, Bank of Finland director and board of management member Matti Louekoski was quoted as saying that the central bank did not see any deflationary trend prevaling.</p>
<p>Louekoski repeated the central bank's standard line that low inflation is a condition for sustained economic growth, low interest rates and increasing demand, which coupled with economic policy decisions will take care of unemployment.</p>
