<p>Voter enthusiasm is so far lacking in a Lithuanian general election that is expected to unseat the government of former Communists and put the right back in power, an opinion poll published on Thursday showed.</p>
<p>The two-stage election on October 20 and November 10 and is the second national poll since Lithuania regained its independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p>The Homeland Union of Vytautas Landsbergis, who led Lithuania's independence drive but was dumped at the ballot box in 1992, hopes for revenge on the Lithuanian Democratic Labour Party (LDLP), born from the old Lithuanian Communist Party.</p>
<p>The LDLP completed its triumph a year later in a presidential election when its leader, Algirdas Brazauskas, beat the candidate backed by Landsbergis.</p>
<p>The Homeland Union has mounted a high-profile campaign, with extensive use of radio and television advertisements.</p>
<p>But a poll in the Respublika newspaper showed only 55 percent of people questioned intended to vote, compared with 62 percent in 1992. Just 25 percent of those planning to turn out knew which member of parliament represented them.</p>
<p>Disillusionment among the young was strong, with the poll showing that 56 percent of people aged 18 to 19 years were not interested in politics, compared with 11 percent in 1992.</p>
<p>In local elections in 1995, only 43 percent of people voted.</p>
<p>The lack of interest in politics is in marked contrast to the euphoria of the days when Lithuania was struggling to regain its independence from Moscow, when many ordinary people took to the streets and manned barricades against Soviet soldiers.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be a reasonable turnout but the election has not caught peoples' enthusiasm and imagination,&quot; one Western diplomat said.</p>
<p>Diplomats said many people regarded politicians with distrust and saw them as only pursuing their own interests. They also seemed to have little faith that politicians or government could actually influence their economic welfare.</p>
<p>But Arturas Racas, political writer for a leading daily newspaper, Lietuvos rytas, said opinion polls had been wrong before and could not be trusted tyis time.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not agree that Lithuanians are not interested in politics. People do not like the situation and they still believe that it can be changed,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said people tended to make up their minds only shortly before voting and expected at least a 65 percent turnout.</p>
<p>Gediminas Vagnorius, chairman of the Homeland Union, said the apparent lack of enthusiasm was a hangover from Soviet days when a way of protesting against Moscow's power was by not voting in elections in which only the Communist Party stood and usually won 99 percent of the votes. &quot;Many still think that not voting is a way of protesting,&quot; he told Reuters.</p>
