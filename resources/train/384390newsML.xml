<title>HUNGARY: ING Barings raises EPSs of six Hungarian companies.</title>
<headline>ING Barings raises EPSs of six Hungarian companies.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1997-02-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>ING Barings raised its 1997 earnings per share (EPS) forecast for six Hungarian companies, the securities house said in the February issue of its Eastern European Monthly.</p>
<p>ING Barings' analyst team upgraded its earlier forecasts for brewery Sopron, plastics group Pannonplast, chemicals Borsodchem, pharmaceuticals Richter, home improvement product maker Graboplast and hotelier Danubius.</p>
<p>It also modified its recommendation for all six stocks.</p>
<p>Sopron's 1997 EPS was raised to 549 forints from the previously forecast 453 forints, ING Barings said, adding &quot;we expect EPS to double as Sopron absorbs Martfu's operation.&quot;</p>
<p>Austria's Brau Union, majority owner of both Soproni and Martfu, said in January it would merge its two Hungarian units and made a buyout offer to all Martfu shareholders at 206 Austrian schillings per share.</p>
<p>Pannonplast's 1997 EPS forecast was increased to 464 forints from 439 forints, on planned capacity increases in four of the group's subsidiaries, quality change in product mix and a possible acquisition.</p>
<p>Borsodchem's EPS was raised to 989 forints from 810 forints, ING Barings said, adding that the company is likely to get a 100 percent tax holiday in 1997.</p>
<p>Ratings of each of Sopron, Pannonplast and Borsodchem were raised to 'buy' from 'long-term buy.'</p>
<p>Whereas Richter's recommendation was reduced to 'long-term buy' from 'buy' despite a rise in its 1997 EPS to 778 forints from 749 forints on &quot;stockpiling ahead of drug price rises in January.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time multiples at Richter are quite demanding such as EV/EBIDTA...that's the reason why ING Barings changed its recommendation to 'long-term buy' from 'buy'&quot; Gabor Sitanyi, ING Barings' analyst in London, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Danubius's EPS was raised to 277 forints from the previously planned 266 forints on &quot;better than expected occupancy rates and delayed financing costs attached to the Hungaria deal.&quot;</p>
<p>Danubius's rating was modified to 'hold' from 'long-term buy' for two reasons, Sitanyi said.</p>
<p>&quot;We didn't fully believe that the assets valuation argument is sustainable including the refurbishment costs at Hungaria (Hotels),&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The other reason was that we expect earnings being depressed over the next six months due to financing and refurbishment costs of Danubius's latest acqusition,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>ING Barings hiked Graboplast's EPS to 437 forints from 381 forints saying it will benefit from a weaker mark.</p>
<p>&quot;Stronger than expected margins as a result of a weak German mark, although the chemicals cycle is likely to work somewhat against the group in 1997,&quot; ING Barings said.</p>
<p>Graboplast's recommendation was changed to 'long-term buy' from 'buy'.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't expect the company to come to the market for new money and EPS growth is still going to be sustainably high,&quot; Sitanyi said.</p>
