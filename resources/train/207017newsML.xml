<p>Germany will keep its investigation centre for Nazi war crimes open for as long as there are Nazi cases to be prosecuted, state justice ministers decided unanimously on Thursday.</p>
<p>The future of the Ludwigsburg centre, which is funded by the 16 federal states, had been in doubt as the number of Nazi trials dwindled and cost pressures grew.</p>
<p>But the ministers decided at their meeting in Bonn to keep the centre in operation and to make sure its historic files would in future remain open to media and researchers.</p>
<p>&quot;The investigations will go on for as long as there is even one file still open,&quot; said Ulrich Goll, justice minister of Baden-Wuerttemberg state where the centre has been located since it opened in 1958. That process might take 10 years, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;This is one of the few institutions that relentlessly pursued the Nazis at a time when the readiness to do so was not so great any more,&quot; Hesse's justice minister Rupert von Plottnitz told a news conference.</p>
<p>The centre gathers and sorts all available documents about Nazi crimes in World War Two, tracks down suspects and passes on the cases to relevant local prosecutors.</p>
<p>The centre triggered 7,116 formal investigations up to the end of last year, eventually producing 6,494 convictions in German courts. Twelve of these were death sentences and 166 of them life sentences.</p>
<p>Veteran Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal appealed to the justice ministers earlier in the week to keep the centre open.</p>
<p>&quot;No institution has done as much, or as seriously, for German honour as the centre in Ludwigsburg...Whoever has been concerned with Nazi crimes and criminals for decades must also finish the job,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But the centre has no power to prosecute cases itself and occasionally local prosecutors' attempts to pursue Nazi war criminals have gone badly wrong.</p>
<p>An Italian court found earlier this year that former SS captian Erich Priebke organised the massacre of 335 men and boys in Rome's Ardeatine caves in 1944.</p>
<p>Priebke was tracked down to Argentina by a journalist after incriminating files lay untouched in Germany in a Dortmund prosecutor's office for decades.</p>
<p>A statute of limitations stopped him being jailed, although he is to be retried because of irregularities at his trial.</p>
<p>The chances of securing further convictions have diminished as suspects have died or become too ill to face possible trial.</p>
<p>As a result the number of staff at Ludwigsburg has fallen to 25 now from 130 in 1967, and just 35 preliminary investigations are still open.</p>
<p>But every year up to 300 historians come to Ludwigsburg to carry out research at the centre, which costs 2.2 million marks ($1.46 million) a year to run. American officers, students and school groups, including some from Israel, have also visited.</p>
<p>There was concern that, once the last few investigations were completed or closed, high costs might prompt the removal of the documents to the vast federal archive in Koblenz, where access would be severely limited.</p>
<p>Friday's decision ensured the documents would remain in Ludwigsburg as the centre is gradually transformed into a permanent research facility.</p>
