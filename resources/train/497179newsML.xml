<p>A judge investigating the alleged illegal funding of French President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist RPR party raided its headquarters on Wednesday to hunt for evidence, party officials said.</p>
<p>Judge Eric Halphen, who is investigating whether the conservative movement received money through kickbacks from Paris public works contractors, left without making any comment after searching the offices, for several hours.</p>
<p>RPR general secretary Jean-Francois Mancel said Halphen asked about the party's accounts and staff and seized documents.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe he took a number of documents but I am not sure which,&quot; Mancel told France-Info radio. &quot;Anyway, he may take away all the documents he wants. They are not at all secret...We are so law-abiding that we have no problems.&quot;</p>
<p>An anonymous informant has for months been sending Halphen copies of confidential police documents, claiming they were related to illicit RPR financing.</p>
<p>Halphen's raid was the latest stage in his dogged inquiry in which dozens of Paris region construction executives are being investigated for alleged misuse of corporate funds.</p>
<p>They are accused of systematically paying kickbacks to covert fundraisers for the party in exchange for contracts for the city of Paris when Chirac was mayor from 1977 to 1995 and from the Ile de France regional council.</p>
<p>All France's mainstream parties are suspected of raising illicit campaign funds with similar schemes in the 1980s and early 1990s. A judge searching for evidence raided Socialist headquarters in 1992 when the party was in government.</p>
<p>Former Socialist Party leader and treasurer Henri Emmanuelli was given a one-year suspended jail term two years ago and faces sentencing next month for receiving illicit campaign funds from a front company run by party insiders.</p>
<p>Halphen's probe has already led to Chirac's successor as mayor, Gaullist Jean Tiberi, and his wife Xaviere being investigated over a payment made to her out of public funds and paid into the couple's joint bank account.</p>
<p>The inquiry has been marked by several incidents. Criminal police chief Olivier Foll was suspended from his investigative capacity for declining to allow his men to help Halphen to search the Tiberis' home.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Jacques Toubon ordered a helicopter to be chartered to track down a magistrate holidaying in Nepal in an effort to head off the probe of Mrs Tiberi.</p>
