<p>Japan on Thursday was urged by an influential panel to set a target to reduce its annual fiscal deficit to below three percent of gross domestic product by 2005, in an effort to balance the state budget.</p>
<p>An advisory panel under Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka submitted a report to the ministry which proposed ways to restructure Japan's finances, but left out the question of whether that included raising taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;State finances are in a critical state. We must urgently tackle fiscal reforms,&quot; Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of the Fiscal System Council, told a news conference.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope this will arouse interest and discussion among the public about fiscal reforms and move the government to tackle the issue seriously,&quot; Toyoda said.</p>
<p>The proposals are likely to be adopted into Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's plans to make the business year starting in April 1997 the first year of fiscal reforms.</p>
<p>Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party and the government are considering the possibility of passing laws to carry out fiscal reforms and panel members said it was now up to the government to decide whether to include the numerical target suggested by the panel in the bills.</p>
<p>Snowballing public debt and dwindling tax revenues have made Japan's budget deficit worse than major industrialised nations such as Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>European countries are now in the midst of bringing down their fiscal deficits to below three percent of their nominal GDP by early 1998 in order to join the European monetary union.</p>
<p>The United States, meanwhile, is trying to balance its budget by 2002.</p>
<p>In its report, the panel said the government should first tackle the task of keeping spending, excluding interest payments and the redemption of government bonds, below revenues in the next two to three years.</p>
<p>The next step would be to keep the fiscal deficit at below three percent of GDP by 2005, which would mean at least a 0.4 percent reduction in the deficit annually, the report said.</p>
<p>The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expects Japan's fiscal deficit for 1997 to be 6.3 percent of its gross domestic product. Japan's nominal GDP stood at 488.5 trillion yen ($4.32 trillion) in the year which ended in March 1996.</p>
<p>At the same time, the government should try to stop issuing deficit-financing bonds and lower its dependency on government bonds to finance the state budget.</p>
<p>Deficit-financing bonds, unlike construction bonds used mainly for infrastructure projects which will benefit the next generation, are issued to fund shortfalls of current administrative costs and need parliamentary approval.</p>
<p>Japan has budgeted 21 trillion yen ($185 billion) worth of government bond issues, including 12 trillion yen ($106 billion) worth of deficit-financing bonds, to fund the core budget for the current fiscal year ending in March 1997.</p>
<p>The government's dependency on bonds to finance its core budget will hit 28 percent at the end of March and government bonds outstanding will total about 240 trillion yen ($2.12 trillion).</p>
<p>The report also urged regional governments to restructure their finances. Japan's outstanding debt, including both central and regional governments, is seen accounting for about 90 percent of GDP at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Japan should aim to manage fiscal finances in a way that would not lead to an accumulation of debt and limit annual growth in both regional and central government spending to below the nation's economic growth rate, it said. ($1=113)</p>
