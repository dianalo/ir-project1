<p>Irish Prime Minister John Bruton told his European Union colleagues on Saturday they must not put off tough decisions on the bloc's future in the hope that they can settle them more easily later on.</p>
<p>At a special EU summit called to give a boost to talks on a new treaty, leaders from the 15-nation bloc were also expected to insist on a European role in the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>But the summit was dominated by fears among leaders that their plans for reforming the bloc to accept new countries from eastern Europe and the Mediterranean were on shaky ground.</p>
<p>Bruton said enlargement meant it would be more rather than less difficult to agree in the future.</p>
<p>&quot;If it's difficult to get agreement among 15 heads of government on a treaty to deal with very difficult and major problems, obviously if we try to do it later on, when we have enlarged and are more than 20 members, it will be even more difficult,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A number of EU leaders have expressed concern that the inter-governmental conference (IGC), a series of negotiations designed to prepare the bloc for expansion, have stagnated.</p>
<p>But recent hints that leading countries are lowering their sights for the IGC, with a view to conducting another set of negotiations later, have triggered even more concern.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it could be dangerous to begin to speculate about (another IGC) today because that could give arguments to those who don't want any changes,&quot; Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson told reporters.</p>
<p>Earlier, Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said that not preparing properly now could be disastrous for the EU's wider plans.</p>
<p>&quot;What we need today is to get reaffirmation from the leadership that we want to make progress...otherwise we're going to delay the whole process of enlargement and that has enormous implications for the rest of Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On a visit to Dublin earlier in the week, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl suggested that one revision of the EU's Maastricht treaty might not be enough.</p>
<p>German officials sought on Saturday to play down the issue, saying Kohl simply believed that EU integration was a continuous process.</p>
<p>But his comments fit in with a general view among negotiators that the IGC will not achieve much until after Britain's elections, which must be held by May next year.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister John Major's Conservative government is opposed to many of the changes being floated at the IGC, notably anything that smacks of a loss of sovereignty.</p>
<p>Underlining this, Major was expected to express his distaste at the Dublin summit for plans to formalise job creation as an EU goal.</p>
<p>Bruton said, however, that the new treaty should not be put into cold storage because of the British election.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think any general election in any country has an overwhelming effect on the issue,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>In a veiled reference to Britain, European Parliament President Klaus Haensch said putting off decisions would only encourage those not favouring further EU integration.</p>
<p>&quot;We absolutely have to rule out talking about a possible (second IGC) because that would take the pressure off getting results next year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The leaders of Portugal and Spain, meanwhile, said they were committed to joining the European Union's planned single currency from the start.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very strong commitment of both governments, both countries, to join a single European currency at the beginning,&quot; Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres said.</p>
