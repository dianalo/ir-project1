<p>The overnight interbank rate was again kept between 6.5 and 7.0 percent on Monday as lenders maintained their rates despite a liquid market, dealers said.</p>
<p>The rate closed at 6.70/80 percent against 6.50 on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The overnight is holding very well despite rising liquidity,&quot; said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>He said with no new issue or maturity of Bank Negara bills this week, interbank rates were expected to stay around current levels.</p>
<p>Market liquidity had improved further following maturities of a 420-million ringgit long term government bond issue and a 500-million ringgit Bank Negara bills issue last week.</p>
<p>Dealers said that even though there was excess liquidity in the market, lenders were wary of offering lower as rumours of a new bonds issue remained rife in view of more bonds maturing this month.</p>
<p>Long-term government bonds worth 900 million ringgit will mature on May 15.</p>
<p>&quot;If the issue is not rolled over, rates may come off again,&quot; said another dealer.</p>
<p>Earlier, interbank rates were mostly unchanged.</p>
<p>One-week money was at 6.50/90 percent against 6.5/7.0 on Friday and three-week was unchanged at 7.10/20 percent.</p>
<p>One-month money at 7.25/30 percent, three-month at 7.30/35 and six-month at 7.35/40, were all unchanged.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were also traded unchanged.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT, the benchmark three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was unchanged at 92.67, or an implied yield of 7.33 percent.</p>
<p>December was at 92.66, or 7.34 percent, and March 1998 at 92.58, or 7.42 percent, both unchanged.</p>
<p>June was untraded.</p>
