<p>South Korea's main political parties agreed to pass a new labour bill on Monday, replacing a law that sparked almost one month of labour strikes, a parliamentary official said.</p>
<p>An evening session of the National Assembly was called to adopt the bill.</p>
<p>The ruling New Korea Party caved in to pressure by agreeing in the revised legislation to delay for two years implementation of a controversial clause making it easier for companies to lay off workers.</p>
<p>Layoffs have been all but impossible in South Korea, where redundancies must be approved by a court.</p>
<p>Provisions designed to discourage strikes that have plagued the economy were watered down and instant recognition was offered to the outlawed Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, which spearheaded industrial action after the law was rammed through parliament on December 26.</p>
<p>Strikes cost the nation $3.28 billion in lost production.</p>
<p>Employers gained modest victories with provisions upholding the principle of &quot;no work, no pay&quot; for strikers and introducing flexible working hours.</p>
<p>But the bill's original intention to help struggling companies stay afloat by allowing them to shed staff was compromised.</p>
<p>President Kim Young-sam was forced to send the law back to parliament after its forced passage unleashed some of the worst industrial unrest in South Korean history. Ruling party members pushed it through in an unannounced dawn session while opposition members slept.</p>
<p>Kim had earlier insisted a flexible labour market was essential to improve the country's industrial competitiveness and reduce a worrying trade deficit.</p>
<p>The New Korea Party and the opposition National Congress for New Politics and United Liberal Democratic Party cobbled together a compromise on the bill on Saturday.</p>
<p>But at the last moment, opposition groups insisted they would only support the law if the ruling camp also agreed to revise another controversial bill restoring powers to the domestic intelligence agency.</p>
<p>The bill on the Agency for National Security Planning, which once hounded political dissidents, was railroaded through parliament along with the labour law. The ruling camp agreed to revise it during the current session of parliament.</p>
<p>There was also squabbling over an opposition demand for parliamentary hearings into a loans scandal that has rocked the nation and hurt President Kim's &quot;Mr Clean&quot; image.</p>
<p>Once again, the ruling camp backed down and promised hearings during the current session. There is still debate over who should be summoned to the hearings, and whether the proceedings should be televised.</p>
<p>Under the revised labour bill, multiple trade unions would be allowed at a national level immediately and at a company level by 2002.</p>
<p>It would also require the abolition of salary payments for full-time union officials in five years.</p>
<p>It abandons clauses allowing firms to sub-contract production and hire outside workers during strikes. Instead of making it illegal to pay strikers, it says companies do not have to pay workers that walk out.</p>
<p>The confederation last week vowed to fight the revised bill, saying it was little better than the one it replaced.</p>
