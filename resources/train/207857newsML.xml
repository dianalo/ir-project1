<p>Italian mutual funds see total net inflows rising in November but to a lesser degree than October's surge to 7.953 trillion lire from 3.408 trillion lire in September, a Reuter survey of fund managers showed.</p>
<p>Italian mutual fund association Assogestioni is due to publish the official data on December 5.</p>
<p>Bond and money market funds continue to dominate the scene, but some fund managers like Sanpaolo Fondi, Arca and Fondigest also saw a slight improvement in the ailing equity fund sector, which should benefit from a falling trend in interest rates and bond yields.</p>
<p>Sanpaolo Fondi said it saw a continuation of the positive trend with over one trillion lire of inflows at mid-month from 2.487 trillion lire in October, with an increase of new inflows directed towards the equity market.</p>
<p>Fund manager Arca also saw an increase in total inflows, including italian equities products, even though &quot;we still don't see a real interest from retail investors&quot;.</p>
<p>For Fondigest, equity funds should break even in November, but they warned that the overall trend in this sector remains weak. The fund saw total inflows rising from the 424.9 billion lire in October.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank in Milan also had a &quot;very favourable&quot; month with net fund inflows totalling 280-290 billion lire at mid month from 527.4 billion lire in October. On equity funds, Deutsche noted a &quot;wait and see attitude&quot; over a widely expected official interest rate cut.</p>
<p>Romagest saw only a &quot;low-key&quot; development, with total net inflows of 140 billion lire at mid-month after 211 billion for the whole of October. The equity sector trend remained negative even if &quot;there is still a hope that expected lower rates will refocus attention on equity products.&quot;</p>
<p>For Gestiras, the trend continued to be positive with total inflows seen at some 10 billion lire at mid-November against 11.7 billion in October. But both Genercomit and Banca Fideuram said that after October highs they expected lower results for November against inflows in October of 600 billion lire and 320 billion respectively.</p>
