<p>The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Wednesday that the country's tourism industry was being held back by a number of &quot;barriers to growth&quot;, citing the planning permission process as one obstacle.</p>
<p>The employers' federation, in a report entitled &quot;Visitors Welcome&quot;, urged the government to set a growth rate target for the industry of one percent above the European average. That average is around eight percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Creating an industry for the future will require decisive action by national and local government and by business,&quot; said CBI Director General Adair Turner.</p>
<p>&quot;The aim is to remove the barriers to faster growth,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The CBI said tourism was now Britain's third largest industry, employing around 1.7 million people and worth over 37 billion stg.</p>
<p>It said the industry should adopt targets of five percent real growth for international receipts and aim for growth in domestic spending above that for consumer expenditure as a whole.</p>
<p>&quot;But growth by numbers will not be enough. Both the industry and the public sector must focus more strongly on adding value,&quot; Turner said.</p>
<p>The CBI said a survey of some 175 businesses had shown around 60 percent listed the difficulty of obtaining planning permission as a major barrier to development.</p>
<p>The CBI's other recommendations included the rapid introduction by the industry of a single classification and grading scheme for accommodation.</p>
<p>It recommended increased funding for the British Tourist Authority (BTA), the removal of tourism-specific taxes and greater spending on transport infrastructure.</p>
<p>The CBI said it was very disappointed with cuts announced in the BTA grant announced by the government in last month's budget. It also criticised the increase in air passenger duty and cuts in spending on London's underground rail network.</p>
