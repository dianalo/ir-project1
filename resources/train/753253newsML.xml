<p>Perkin-Elmer Corp Thursday reported fourth quarter, ended June 30, earnings per share rose 35 percent before special items to $0.85 from $0.63 a year earlier on a 13 percent increase in revenues to $347 million, from $305 million in last year's fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Revenues of the Applied Biosystems Division accounted for 52 percent of the company's total, it said. Currency fluctuations decreased revenues by about $14 million, or 4 percent, in the current quarter compared with last year.  </p>
<p>Chief Executive Officer Tony White said the Analytical Instruments Division's &quot;restructuring program is proceeding as planned, but we remain concerned about the division's future revenue growth.</p>
<p>&quot;At the same time, we've broadened the leadership position of the Applied Biosystems Division in rapidly growing life science markets, both by increasing our internal development efforts and through acquisitions and collaborations that promise to propel future growth.&quot;  </p>
<p>He pointed out sales and earnings, before special items, have now risen for eight consecutive quarters when compared with prior year periods.</p>
<p>Geographically, Perkin Elmer said, it reported revenue growth in each of its major regions in the fourth quarter. Revenues grew 11 percent in both the United States and Europe, and 27 percent in the Far East. Without the effect of currency, revenues in Europe and the Far East would have increased 19 percent and 36 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Regions outside the United States accounted for 61 percent of consolidated fourth-quarter revenues, which is consistent with the prior year, the company said.</p>
<p>The fourth-quarter restructuring charge, preliminary details of which were announced on May 13, amounted to $24.2 million before taxes. It was partially offset lower than expected costs for the restructuring announced in 1996.</p>
<p>The costs to implement the program were $11.2 million below the $71.6 million restructuring charge provided in last year, the company said.</p>
