<headline>NATO's Solana to meet Russian leaders on charter.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1996-09-09</dateline>

<p>NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana announced on Monday he would meet Russian leaders this month to work on a charter that will govern future relations.</p>
<p>&quot;What the alliance wants...is that bilateral relations be as deep and stable as possible and expressed within a legal framework,&quot; Solana told a news conference in Madrid. &quot;Positive relations with Russia is one of the aims in my mandate.&quot;</p>
<p>Solana, a former Spanish foreign minister, said he would meet Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov later this month but gave no dates. NATO diplomats said last week the meeting would be in Vienna on September 20.</p>
<p>Solana also said he also plans to meet Russian Defence Minister General Igor Rodionov in the near future, hopefully also this month.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher called last week for a formal charter to frame NATO-Russia relations which would make Moscow a full partner in building a new Europe.</p>
<p>Russia has staunchly opposed NATO plans to expand its membership to take in former Soviet-bloc countries but has recently indicated it does not want the issue to stand in the way of a new relationship with the 16-nation alliance.</p>
<p>The charter, which was discussed last week by NATO countries, could regulate issues of concern to Moscow such as NATO rules for stationing nuclear weapons or deploying troops in crises as well as outlining cooperation on peacekeeping.</p>
<p>Diplomats say the allies want a mechanism that allows Moscow to have some form of hot-line to NATO headquarters.</p>
<p>Christopher said a NATO meeting to name new members will be held in the spring or summer of 1997 and called for the charter with Russia to be ready for the same summit.</p>
<p>Solana was in Madrid to discuss Spain's integration into NATO's military structure.</p>
