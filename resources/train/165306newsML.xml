<headline>FEATURE - French arms industry moves upset partners.</headline>

<p>France's efforts to consolidate its fragmented defence industry have caused uncertainty among its partners, particularly Germany, and raised questions over the future of collaborative projects.</p>
<p>French and German defence executives told Reuters in mid-October that France's failure to consult its partners and unilateral moves to reorganise its arms industry have hindered the four-nation NH90 military helicopter and planned mergers of the missiles and satellites activities of the two countries.</p>
<p>France's state-owned Aerospatiale is extremely frustrated that after years of talks with Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace (Dasa), parallel mergers of their satellite and missile units have failed to materialise despite official blessing from their respective governments.</p>
<p>But a German executive, speaking on condition of anonymity, said things were changing fast in France and Germany needed to know what was happening on a number of collaborative projects before it would complete the mergers.</p>
<p>&quot;Things are fluid. We have to wait to see what will happen in the French defence industry restructuring,&quot; he said. &quot;In the last six months there have been fundamental changes.&quot;</p>
<p>The latest big development was the announcement by the French government on October 16 that it wants the Lagardere conglomerate to create a big missile company with the merger of Thomson-CSF and Lagardere's Matra.</p>
<p>That will rival Aerospatiale's position with the creation of a group with annual sales of some 60 billion french francs ($11.71 billion) and include the missiles unit of British Aerospace Plc (BAe).</p>
<p>Lagardere chairman Jean-Luc Lagardere told the defence committee of the French Senate on October 23 the new Thomson Matra company would be &quot;contagious&quot; and it was the natural centre for a European restructuring. He said talks had been held with Dasa for a link-up, minutes of the session showed.</p>
<p>Lagardere officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Aerospatiale officials said the Thomson Matra deal would not hurt them as there was room for two French groups and Aerospatiale works on a number of missile projects with Matra.</p>
<p>But Dasa wants to know what the French government's long term plans are, for example what will happen to Aerospatiale's missiles activity when the group is privatised.</p>
<p>One French company executive said the French government's choice of Lagardere to buy Thomson-CSF meant slowing down consolidation at the European level.</p>
<p>&quot;People say the biggest loser was GEC,&quot; said a French company executive.</p>
<p>The rival suitor for Thomson was French engineering giant Alcatel Alsthom, which had lined up Britain's General Electric Co (GEC) as a partner for Thomson-CSF if it won.</p>
<p>But executives said that would have brought GEC closer to Thomson than the French government wanted, and that the aim of President Jacques Chirac was to create strong French national champions before linking up at the European level.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, France aroused anger earlier this year when it cut its estimated requirement of the NH90 tactical transport and navy helicopter to 160 from 220. Paris has also sought price cuts of up to 30 percent as part of across-the-board reductions.</p>
<p>Germany, Italy and the Netherlands are also buying the NH90, and any changes in orders could affect unit prices.</p>
<p>NH Industries is the NH90 prime contractor, with industrial partners Eurocopter, Agusta SpA of Italy and Fokker Aviation of the Netherlands. Eurocopter is a joint venture between Aerospatiale and Dasa.</p>
<p>NH Industries has submitted figures to the four governments so they can draw up a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for the tooling-up and production phase of the project.</p>
<p>It has used the original estimated 726 orders for its costings, which assume unit prices of 90 million and 145 million francs respectively for the tactical and navy versions. ($1=5.125 French Franc)</p>
