<p>Following are economists' reactions to data on Friday showing a 0.3 percent fall in real, seasonally-adjusted New Zealand retail sales in the September quarter.</p>
<p>Economists were forecasting on average a fall of 0.38 percent for the quarter.</p>
<p>KEVIN SMIT, NATIONAL BANK TREASURY ECONOMIST</p>
<p>&quot;The seasonally adjusted sales before adjustment for price changes were slightly weak but only marginally weaker than we thought...  </p>
<p>&quot;The real data was right in line with what we thought and underpins this view that the September quarter won't be a particularly strong quarter in terms of growth.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it should make too much difference to financial markets. It was well anticipated.</p>
<p>&quot;It's more a confirmation of the general picture of the economy bumping along the bottom, troughing, rather than giving us any new information about the market being weaker than people generally anticipated.&quot;</p>
<p>STEPHEN TOPLIS, DOYLE PATERSON BROWN ECONOMIST  </p>
<p>&quot;It is indicative of a general weakening in the economy, and obviously in retail trade in particular, notwithstanding the fact that obviously the numbers are biased downwards by a very weak motor vehicle retailing sector.</p>
<p>&quot;I think if you want to take a pessimistic view of all this, you could actually say retail sales in total have now contracted for two consecutive quarters. That's a reasonably recessionary environment for the total sales, although again it's more driven by the automotive group than anything else.  </p>
<p>&quot;On balance it's consistent with what you'd expect to see in an economy that is really being slowed by very tight monetary policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly the Reserve Bank will not be unhappy with these numbers.&quot;</p>
