<title>USA: Quaker profits up 23 percent.</title>
<headline>Quaker profits up 23 percent.</headline>
<dateline>IRVING, Texas</dateline>
<text>
<p>Quaker State Corp. said Wednesday its second-quarter profits rose 23 percent, boosted by acquisitions and improvements at its lubricants and lubricant services division.</p>
<p>Net income for the quarter ended June 30 grew to $8.8 million, or 25 cents per share, from $7.2 million, or 22 cents per share, for the same 1996 period. Revenues rose 14 percent to $342.8 million from $301.8 million.</p>
<p>The results include Blue Coral and Medo Industries, which Quaker State acquired in the second half of 1996. Blue Coral produces popular lines of automotive appearance products and Medo is a leading manufacturer of automotive air fresheners.</p>
<p>Operating profit for Lubricants and Lubricant Services rose 6 percent to $12.6 million despite a 4 percent drop in sales to $244.7 million.</p>
<p>Quaker State's consumer products segment earned $12.7 mlilion on sales of $77.8 million. The results were bolstered by the Blue Coral and Medo acquisitions.</p>
<p>&quot;Our expanded consumer products segment is a significant factor in Quaker State's drive toward sustainable growth,&quot; said Quaker State chairman Herbert Baum.</p>
<p>&quot;And despite the continuing softness in the motor oil category, we see opportunities to strengthen our bottom line by reducing costs and improving profitability in our lubricants and lubricant services business.&quot;</p>
<p>Separately, the Federal Trade Commission in Washington said it reached an agreement with Quaker State regarding advertising of its Blue Coral &quot;Slick 50&quot; engine treatment.</p>
<p>The FTC said Quaker agreed to discontinue advertising what the FTC said was false, that the treatment reduces engine wear.</p>
<p>Quaker State subsidiaries falsely claimed that the product &quot;reduces wear (on engines) up to 50 percent for 50,000 miles,&quot; the FTC said. The company also falsely claimed that without the product there would be &quot;unseen damage&quot; when an engine is started, the FTC said.</p>
<p>The FTC said that if consumers recover less than $10 million in class-action suits pending against Quaker State for the false advertising, the commission has the option of further pursuing the company.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Quaker State said the company producing Slick 50 was already under investigation when it was purchased by Quaker State. He said the ads had been discontinued.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Slick 50 is oil with Teflon added. The spokesman said that Quaker State believes the product increases wear reduction properties of oil and extends the life of the engine.</p>
<p>Quaker State's stock rose 19 cents to $15.94 on the New York Stock Exchange in late trading.</p>
