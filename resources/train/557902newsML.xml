<p>The Labour Party's electoral avalanche in Britain left Hong Kong unmoved, as political leaders, businessmen and activists looked ahead instead to the British colony's imminent return to China.</p>
<p>The last British Governor Chris Patten and the territory's future leader Tung Chee-hwa congratulated Labour leader Tony Blair on his victory, but most commentators said the election would have little impact in the territory.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think we are disappointed or elated, either way,&quot; said Henry Tang, head of the Hong Kong Federation of Industry and a member of the administration that will run the territory when Britain hands it back to China at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>There was little difference in the policies on Hong Kong supported by Labour and the defeated Conservative Party that it swept from power in Thursday's poll, Tang told Reuters.</p>
<p>In congratulatory messages, future leader Tung said he looked forward to working with Labour, while Patten stressed the importance of bipartisan support for policies on Hong Kong.</p>
<p>British influence was fading in Hong Kong, with only 60 days to go before the handover of sovereignty, said the influential independent Chinese-language newspaper, the Economic Journal.</p>
<p>When 156 years of colonial rule from London come to an end, the only force that will be able to contend with Beijing will be the United States, it said in an editorial.</p>
<p>&quot;It's far more important for Hong Kong in economic terms and in political terms for our new government to be on good terms with the United States than with Great Britain,&quot; agreed Ted Thomas, founder of a campaign to boost Hong Kong's image abroad.</p>
<p>The United States &quot;are a much bigger customer of ours,&quot; he said. &quot;The best we can hope for is that we get what everybody wants, which is a happy transition, with as little interference from the government in the U.K.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As far as Hong Kong is concerned I don't think (the poll) is going to make a great deal of difference,&quot; said Martin Barrow, a director of Jardine Matheson, one of the leading companies, or &quot;hongs&quot;, and a pillar of the colonial order.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly the Labour Party leaders will want to establish good links with China, and that of course is in the interests of the people of Hong Kong,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>While Labour has given almost uniform support to Tory policies on Hong Kong during years of often bitter Sino-British wrangling, Hong Kong newspapers have suggested that a change of government might bring an opportunity to boost ties.</p>
<p>Legislator and pro-democracy activist Emily Lau said talk of improving Sino-British relations usually meant Britain bowing to Chinese wishes, and that Labour should do more to protect the freedoms of Hong Kong's 6.4 million people.</p>
<p>&quot;Labour has been very detached and has never seriously questioned or challenged the Tory decisions,&quot; Lau said, adding Britain had a responsibility to monitor post-colonial Hong Kong.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Hong Kong people have a suspicion that Labour care even less about Hong Kong,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm not hopeful that they will stand up to China. They have never done so.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers said the results of the U.K. election should have very limited impact on the local stock market.</p>
<p>&quot;It has no effect; the Labour Party has nothing to do with Hong Kong and there is just about 60 days to go,&quot; said Boby Ho, dealing manager at G.K. Goh Securities.</p>
<p>The once staunchly Conservative British business community in Hong Kong reacted without dismay to Labour triumph.</p>
<p>Members of the British Chamber of Commerce attending an election-watch breakfast gathering even expressed amusement as the scale of the Conservative defeat became clear.</p>
<p>&quot;We Hongkongers are interested in what goes on in our country of origin, but really a change of government will have little impact unless Labour raises taxes,&quot; said the chamber's executive director Christopher Hammerbeck.</p>
