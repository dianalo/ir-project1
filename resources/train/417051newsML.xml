<title>UK: World oil prices continue tentative recovery.</title>

<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>World oil prices continued their tentative recovery on Tuesday following a late rally on Monday which pulled levels up from fresh lows.</p>
<p>&quot;Sentiment was still negative (on Monday) as the markets dipped and then pared losses by the end of the day,&quot; said brokers GNI Ltd in London in a report. &quot;That is not to say a fundamental floor has necessarily been found yet.&quot;</p>
<p>World benchmark North Sea Brent Blend crude oil futures for April delivery closed up 58 cents at $19.50 a barrel on London's International Petroleum Exchange, boosted in late trade by a wave of short-covering.</p>
<p>On Monday, Brent fell to an eight-month low of $18.68 as the market continued a headlong slide in prices which has seen Brent plummet by nearly $6 from the year's high of $24.91 hit in January.</p>
<p>A mild northern hemisphere winter, which has stunted demand for heating oil and allowed global inventories to recover from historically low levels, and rising output from producers both inside and outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), lie behind the steep price slide.</p>
<p>But any significant further price falls were likely to be delayed at least until after the closely monitored American Petroleum Institute (API) U.S. inventory report is released later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>April crude oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) had slipped below the $20 mark on Monday to a low of $19.96, the lowest level since June 26, 1996, but rallied strongly in late trade on Tuesday as buyers came in to square positions.</p>
<p>&quot;Part of this is pre-API short-covering, but we were also able to bounce back after making new lows yesterday, so this is some follow-through from this,&quot; said Refco Inc vice president Victor Yu in New York.</p>
<p>The API inventory report is expected to show a draw of one to two million barrels in distillates, which include heating oil, in the latest week because of the recent mild weather.</p>
<p>A colder spell in part of the United States this week was seen providing only limited support.</p>
<p>&quot;With the winter almost over, the cold is expected to be very temporary, no-one is getting too excited about this influence,&quot; said brokers GNI in London.</p>
