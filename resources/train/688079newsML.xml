<p>The Dutch consumer confidence index was an unchanged at 16 in June compared to May, the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p> DUTCH CONSUMER CONFIDENCE	  June 97    May 97     June 96</p>
<p> Index (no base date)		   16	   16	   -1</p>
<p>Note - The index can vary between -100 and +100 points with zero as the neutral midpoint. A negative index value indicates a majority of the consumers polled by the CBS are pessimistic.</p>
<p>The total index is made up of two subindices which reflect consumers' feelings about the general economic climate and about their personal finances and spending plans:</p>
<p>					    June 97    May 97    June 96</p>
<p> Subindex economic climate:	   18	   23	  -8</p>
<p> Subindex personal finances:	  14	   11	   4</p>
<p>The CBS said the indicator for personal finances had been increasing in the last six months and reached a new high in June.</p>
<p>CBS said the personal finances index had reached the highest level in the last ten years.</p>
<p>Consumers told the CBS they had been choosing to spend on durable goods during the period. The CBS said the outcome on the willingness to spend on durable goods is as high as it was in 1977 and 1978.</p>
<p>The economic climate index was also at a high level in June, although it did not maintain the previous high, set in May.</p>
