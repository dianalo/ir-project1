<headline>Gold Outlook-price consolidates but threat remains.</headline>

<p>Precious metals prices were consolidating on Monday but dealers and analyst saw struggles ahead, especially for gold.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeing some consolidation but the overall bear trend has some way to run,&quot; one analyst said.</p>
<p>The platinum group metals (PGMs) were also going through a consolidation phase late last week after palladium exports from Russia arrived in Japan for the first time this year.</p>
<p>One dealer said the palladium market was behaving in perfect &quot;buy the rumour sell the fact&quot; mode after the much-delayed beginning of Russia's 1997 export campaign was confirmed with arrivals in Tokyo last Thursday.</p>
<p>Palladium crumbled to two-month lows on the news but dealers said they were not surprised palladium bounced off those levels as the recent decline from June's 17-year highs had been excessively sharp.</p>
<p>Palladium hit a high of $240 in June after storming up from $120 in February on extreme supply tightness caused by the Russian export delays.</p>
<p>&quot;Eventually palladium is going to come back down, maybe even to $130. But right now a slight correction is in order after the recent drop,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>Gold, having moved away from 12-year lows of $313.60 earlier in the week, was back up to around $321-$322 on Monday morning.</p>
<p>&quot;Gold has become very oversold on the technical charts and, having bounced off support around $315 this week, may even see a short covering rally in coming days,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>But the bounce was unlikely to go much beyond $330 or last very long, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gold prices tumbled at the beginning of the month when the Australian central bank announced it had sold 167 tonnes of its reserves.</p>
<p>Australia is the world's third biggest gold miner behind South Africa and the United States and its national bank has been criticised by gold miners at home and abroard for what they see as a breach of faith.</p>
<p>Concerns of more institutional selling to come continue to weigh heavily on the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The attitude of the central banks, especially in Europe, sends threatening vibes out. Sentiment is very bearish and it remains likely gold will see a strong test of $300 and lower sooner or later,&quot; the dealer said.</p>
<p>The banks have over 28,000 tonnes of gold sitting in their vaults and there have been increasing signs they were not keen on holding on to it.</p>
<p>&quot;It might not be true to say the banks have the industry at their mercy but there have to be changes as the realities of gold are appreciated,&quot; one commodities markets economist said.</p>
<p>That would inevitably lead to lower gold prices and fewer mines producing the metal.</p>
<p>Metal markets analyst Rhona O'Connell at stockbrokers T. Hoare added, &quot;Canada has been (selling from its reserves) for 20 years without causing the same uproar. It is unfortunate the Australian sale is taking place while sentiment is so bad. On a daily market basis 167 tonnes is not critical but shows a classic example of the market's vulnerability.&quot;</p>
<p>She added that unhedged producers in South Africa and Australia are definitely losing money at these prices. &quot;As much as 57 percent of of western world gold production is now at a loss,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;What is happening is that gold is being revalued to the market, which shows that gold is not an asset apart because it has to perform,&quot; said precious metals markets analyst Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS).</p>
<p>Smith estimated the cost of holding gold by the 12 central banks with the highest gold holdings was $15 billion a year in lost interest earnings.</p>
<p>Tony Warwick-Ching, senior markets analyst at CRU International said that central banks all over the world were probably doing the same cost-benefit analysis on their reserves and were coming to similar conclusions.</p>
<p>But whether or not there &quot;would be a rush for the exits&quot; as a result was debatable, he said.</p>
<p>UBS's Smith reasoned that a low price was not an issue for a central bank thinking of changing its reserve asset ratio by selling gold. &quot;The banks are now as cunning and savvy as any investor and that is the problem,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But another market observer said, &quot;Another central bank sale would take the price to under $300 very quickly.&quot;</p>
