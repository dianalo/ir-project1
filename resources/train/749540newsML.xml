<headline>Fed has moved to assure confidentiality--Greenspan.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-07-23</dateline>

<p>The Federal Reserve Board has moved to tighten access to confidential information after two Democratic lawmakers cited what they called lapses in secrecy, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have taken steps to assure that only appropriate people have access to confidential information of the Federal Open Market Committee,&quot; Greenspan said in letters to Reps. Henry Gonzalez of Texas and Maurice Hinchey of New York that were dated July 18 but released to the press on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>In a July 2 joint statement, Hinchey, a member of the House Banking Committee, and Gonzalez, the panel's ranking Democrat, called on the Fed to tighten controls over monetary policy secrets.</p>
<p>The lapses they identified included the presence of more than 400 people at FOMC meetings, 300 staffers and directors at monthly board meetings of the 12 Fed Banks, the Minneapolis Fed meeting at a motel or private bank, and foreign central bankers at a Kansas City Fed vote on the discount rate.</p>
<p>&quot;With regard to discount rate discussions at Reserve Banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City no longer allows foreign central bankers to sit in on such discussions of the Board of Directors,&quot; Greenspan said.</p>
<p>&quot;The general matter of attendance at confidential directors' discussions has been referred to an internal committee for review,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Greenspan said research directors and FOMC members have been reminded that only full-time Fed employees may have access to confidential information and that the contents of documents are not to be discussed with anyone who does not have appropriate clearance.</p>
