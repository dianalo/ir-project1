<p>Authorities in Cuba have detained three dissidents involved in trying to produce independent economic reports and news articles, diplomatic sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The sources said that Marta Beatriz Roque, director of a group called the Association of Independent Economists, and journalists Tania Quintero and Juan Antonio Sanchez were detained on Tuesday afternoon near the Czech embassy, which they had apparently been visiting.</p>
<p>The three were under investigation at a Havana police station, the sources added. They had no other details of the case.</p>
<p>There was no confirmation of the detentions by Cuban authorities, who rarely comment on cases involving the communist-ruled island's small, illegal opposition groups.</p>
<p>The detentions coincided with a 24-hour visit by Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy.</p>
<p>Axworthy, who was leaving Cuba later Wednesday, told reporters late on Tuesday he had raised Canadian concerns about human rights during talks with President Fidel Castro.</p>
