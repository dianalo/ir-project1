<p>Shenzhen Fangda Industrial Co Ltd said on Thursday it planned to issue 30 million additional foreign currency B shares tentatively priced at between HK$8 and HK$9 each.</p>
<p>The decision was made at a shareholders' meeting on Wednesday, the company said in a statement published in the Shenzhen-based Securities Times.</p>
<p>Trading in shares of Fangda, a high-tech construction materials maker, were suspended on Wednesday due to the shareholders' meeting and also on Thursday morning due to the announcement of the new share issue. Trading will resume on Thursday afternoon.  </p>
<p>Fangda would like to issue the shares &quot;as soon as possible&quot;, a company official told Hong Kong-based newsletter China Securities Bulletin on Thursday.</p>
<p>The issue still needs the approval of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the top securities watchdog, she said.</p>
<p>An official at Jardine Fleming International Inc said it might take part in underwriting part of the new shares.</p>
<p>Fangda's shareholders also decided to offer a 0.15 yuan per share cash dividend to all shareholders from its 1996 profit, the company statement said.</p>
<p>The company's 1996 net profit soared 157 percent year-on-year to 107.26 million yuan based on Chinese accounting standards.</p>
<p>Under international standards, Fangda made an after-tax profits of 107.90 million yuan last year.</p>
<p>Comparative figures for 1995 were not available.</p>
<p>By the end of 1996, Fangda had a total of 210 million outstanding shares, consisting of 112 million institutional shares, 67,200 staff shares, 27.9328 million A shares and 70 million B shares.</p>
