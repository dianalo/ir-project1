<title>COSTA RICA: Kidnappers of Dutch couple arrested in Nicaragua.</title>

<p>Seven members of an armed gang suspected of kidnapping a Dutch couple earlier this year in Costa Rica were captured in southern Nicaragua on Tuesday, Costa Rican police said.</p>
<p>&quot;We're talking about seven Nicaraguans, mostly either former Sandinista or Contra guerrillas,&quot; said a spokesman for Costa Rica's Judicial Investigation Unit, a branch of the country's Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The spokesman, who did not wish to be identified, had no other details about the identity of the men. The leftist Sandinista government ruled Nicaragua during the 1980s, while U.S.-backed Contra rebels fought the Sandinistas during that time.</p>
<p>Nicaraguan troops and Costa Rican police carried out a joint operation, capturing the men early on Tuesday in the southern San Carlos region of Nicaragua, 200 kms (124 miles) southeast of the capital Managua.</p>
<p>Hurte Sierd Zylstra and his wife Jetsi Hendrika, both 50, were kidnapped on August 25 in northern Costa Rica near the Nicaraguan border, where they worked as managers of a teak tree farm.</p>
<p>The couple were freed by their captors weeks later after a ransom was paid. Newspapers reported initially that the ransom was $600,000, although a lawyer for the tree farm told reporters earlier this week the amount was $200,000.</p>
<p>Costa Rican police said Esteban Paiz Lanza, a former Contra, was arrested earlier this week in the San Carlos area on suspicion of belonging to the gang. The kidnappers had asked him to negotiate on their behalf during the abduction, police said.</p>
