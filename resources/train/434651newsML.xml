<title>SINGAPORE: Asian crude weakens, Minas and Duri overhang.</title>

<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-03-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Asian crude prices were weaker on Tuesday in quiet trading with most focus on the overhang of Minas and Duri crudes for March lifting.</p>
<p>Up to 600,000 barrels of Minas were heard traded into China this week between ICP -30 and ICP -50 cents. The deal would help soak up some of the overhang of the crude owing to Dumai's maintenance and Balongan's shut down.</p>
<p>But traders said as much as 800,000 barrels of Duri may still be available for spot buyers and that there was unlikely to be much demand for the crude outside of blenders.</p>
<p>&quot;Main demand has already been met,&quot; one trader said.  </p>
<p>Traders said the China trade would leave around 200,000 to 400,000 barrels of Minas on the market. One affiliate was offering Minas at ICP -10 cents.</p>
<p>MidEast cargoes were heard all placed and focus was moving to the Masila second-quarter term talks.</p>
<p>Traders said the weakening Brent complex was prompting some firm bids around dated Brent less 80 cents, although some players had bid around dated Brent less 95 cents.</p>
<p>First quarter term contracts were concluded at dated Brent less 97 cents.</p>
<p>Futures in Asia were offering little direction on the day.  </p>
<p>NYMEX April crude on ACCESS last traded at $20.52, up three cents from New York, while May remained in contango, last trading at $20.59, up four cents.</p>
<p>April Brent on SIMEX was quoted at $19.25/$19.33, around the London close of $19.28 and the spread with May was a narrow 7/8 cents, brokers said.</p>
<p>They doubted the changing picture on the futures would affect Asian wet trade. April MidEast cargoes were mostly placed, while regional grades were still to be soaked up by the market. </p>
