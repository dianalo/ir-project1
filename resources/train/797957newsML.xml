<p>The won closed higher against the dollar on Wednesday as the central bank injected dollars to ease tightening dollar positions, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Korea intervened in early trading, selling dollars in one-month, three-month, and six-month forward trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank's intervention chilled trading. The market hardly moved this afternoon,&quot; said a domestic bank dealer.</p>
<p>The won closed at 894.30, against Tuesday's closing of 894.60. It opened at 894.70 and moved between 894.10 and 894.90.  </p>
<p>The central bank said on Wednesday it had supplied $1 billion on Tuesday to commercial banks to ease dollar shortages.</p>
<p>&quot;The market now looks squared-off in dollar positions,&quot; said a foreing bank dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers said dollars were recently drying up because of rising importer settlements.</p>
<p>The won's mid-rate is expected to be pegged at 894.30 on Thursday, compared with 894.40 today.</p>
<p>Brokers forecast trading would range from 894.00 to 894.60 on Thursday.</p>
