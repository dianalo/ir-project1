<p>A judge who must decide whether to put Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi on trial ordered an investigation into financial aspects of the case on Friday in a move that will delay proceedings for at least three months.</p>
<p>Examining judge Edoardo Landi, sitting behind closed doors, granted a request by another defendant for a court-appointed evaluation of the regularity of a controversial privatisation in 1993 at the root of allegations of abuse of office.</p>
<p>&quot;The judge ruled that he could not decide anything except on the basis of a study,&quot; Prodi's lawyer Paola Severino told reporters after the brief session, the first since the committal hearing technically opened on January 15.</p>
<p>She said the hearing would reconvene on March 19 for the judge to appoint expert inspectors.</p>
<p>They will then have at least 60 days to carry out their study and draft their findings. &quot;The study will look into the correctness of the procedure followed and the suitability of the sale price,&quot; Severino said.</p>
<p>She said the judge's decision was &quot;proof of his conscientiousness&quot; in the affair.</p>
<p>Prodi, head of a centre-left government since last May, was chairman of giant state industrial holding IRI in October 1993 when it sold food group Cirio to a little-known southern consortium, Fis.Vi for 310 billion lire ($184 million).</p>
<p>Public prosecutor Giuseppa Geremia alleges that Prodi and five other IRI board members at the time awarded an &quot;unjust advantage&quot; to Fis.Vi, whose former chief executive, Carlo Saverio Lamiranda, is also a defendant.</p>
<p>All deny the allegations on the basis of which Geremia has asked for the seven to be indicted.</p>
<p>Prodi has said he will not resign even if the case is sent to trial and was elsewhere recording a television interview on Italy's drive to join Europe's planned single currency when proceedings got under way on Friday.</p>
<p>He has suffered no evident political damage from the case, which does not involve any allegations of personal enrichment.</p>
<p>His lawyers have argued that he has no case to answer. The offence of abuse of office can be levelled against state employees and has itself become controversial, with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro joining calls for a change in the law.</p>
<p>Critics argue that the charge is vague, ranging in potential scope from administrative errors that would not constitute a criminal offence in many countries to fraud.</p>
<p>Cirio, best known for its canned tomatoes, was sold privately to Fis.Vi after IRI decided that offers submitted in a public tender did not meet the right conditions.</p>
<p>Fis.Vi soon after sold the company's olive oil interests to the Anglo-Dutch group Unilever, for which Prodi had worked as a consultant, and has since divested itself of the whole group.</p>
<p>Prodi denies his relationship with Unilever held any conflict of interest, saying he had cut his ties months earlier, in May 1993, when he became chairman of IRI for a second time.</p>
<p>The request for a court-appointed investigation into the Cirio sale was submitted by lawyers for Mario Draghi, who is director general of the Treasury Ministry and was a board member of IRI at the time of the sale of Cirio.</p>
