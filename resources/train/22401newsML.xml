<p>Paris stocks and the franc fell on Thursday because of fears of autumn industrial unrest in France and other European bouses were dragged down by renewed U.S. inflation worries.</p>
<p>Anxiety over French industrial strife and the timetable for the single European currency drove French shares sharply and hit the franc, which fell to a five-month low against the mark at one stage.</p>
<p>The dollar strengthened against the mark as figures on Thursday showed the U.S. economy booming more than expected, rekindling talk of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>The Paris bourse fell by 1.4 percent as the U.S. figures added interest rate worries to concerns that French unions were preparing to challenge the conservative government in the autumn over its social and economic policies.</p>
<p>&quot;We're looking at a context similar to that of November 1995 (when public sector unions struck for three weeks), possibly worse,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The fears of industrial unrest and the single currency timetable dragged down the franc to 3.4296 per mark -- its worst level since March 25 -- before it recovered to 3.4260 by early afternoon.</p>
<p>The franc was hit by jitters over Economic and Monetary Union in the run-up to 1997 budget presentations. Debate over the EMU timetable and efforts to meet convergence criteria have rekindled fears which had been largely soothed by a EU show of unity.</p>
<p>Threats of strikes in France have underlined the difficulty of reconciling fiscal austerity with public resistance to the spending cuts demanded by EMU.</p>
<p>&quot;The French arithmetic will add up -- but the credibility of those sums will be immediately questioned,&quot; said Stuart Thomson, chief international economist at Nikko Europe.</p>
<p>Other European equity markets were hurt by the data from the Commerce Department which showed the US. economy growing more robustly than expected, at its fastest rate in two years.</p>
<p>The U.S. gross domestic product expanded at a 4.8 percent annual rate in the three months from April instead of 4.2 percent as estimated a month ago.</p>
<p>The surprisingly strong surge was likely to fuel doubts that a predicted second-half slowdown will occur soon enough to deter the Federal Reserve from increasing interest rates later this year.</p>
<p>The figures, and the negative opening on Wall Street, pushed the London bourse, already languishing, down 0.8 percent. But trading volumes were thin.</p>
<p>&quot;Its such a thin volatile market everywhere that every move is  being exaggerated,&quot; said one market-maker.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, trading on ther computerised IBIS index fell by 0.5 percent after the release of the U.S. growth figures. Floor trading ended down 3.10 points at 2560.06.</p>
<p>The dollar was the main beneficiary of the Washington report, stregthening to 1.4797 marks after 1.4770 in late European trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The figures tend to tempt foreign currency traders to switch their investments into dollars from other currencies, attracted by the talk of higher U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1430 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 108.36 yen and 1.4797 marks compared with Wednesday's European close of 108.45 yen and 1.4770 marks</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1430 GMT</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 index was down 30.6  at 3888.1.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's DAX index ended down down 3.10 at 2560.06.</p>
<p>The Paris CAC-40 was down 29.15 1973.75.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $388.00 an ounce in the afternoon, just five cents under the morning fix, compared to Wednesday's close of $388.55. Silver was at $5.20, down a cent.</p>
