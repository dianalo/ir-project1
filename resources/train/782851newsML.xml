<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after talks with Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan on Wednesday Israel would ease sanctions against the Palestinian Authority only after it begins to fight &quot;terrorism&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;We are firm in the measures that we have taken,&quot; Netanyahu told a news conference. &quot;We expect to have the Palestinian Authority carry out its obligations if they expect us to carry out our obligations. And that remains our position.&quot;</p>
<p>Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip after an attack in a Jerusalem street market on July 30, a closure which Palestinian President Yasser Arafat condemned as collective punishment.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said it was not Israel's intention to inflict &quot;undue suffering&quot; on Palestinians and it had allowed humanitarian supplies of food and medicine into self-ruled areas.</p>
<p>But he appeared to give little ground to Arab calls for an easing of the Israeli blockade.</p>
<p>&quot;If they begin to fight terrorism, we will review the various steps that were taken in order to make them fight terrorism,&quot; Netanyahu said of the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>Crown Prince Hassan, King Hussein's brother, was the first high-level Arab official to travel to Israel since the attack in an apparent bid to persuade Netanyahu to take a softer line.</p>
<p>&quot;We stand by our measures,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p>
<p>&quot;We will not rescind our expectation and our request that the Palestinian Authority fights terrorism,&quot; he said. &quot;This is our policy. If they act, we will act.&quot;</p>
<p>Netanyahu wants the self-rule Authority, led by Arafat, to crack down on Moslem militants Israel said were behind the twin bombing that killed 15 people including the two bombers.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, replying to a question, rejected a U.S. call to unfreeze 70 million shekels ($19.8 million) of tax revenues which Israel has withheld from the Palestinian Authority since the bombing.</p>
<p>Crown Prince Hassan described the situation as a &quot;very dangerous crisis&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to say that we are on the brink of revisiting violence and clearly we should do everything that we can in our commitment to security to avoid an eruption of violence of any kind, particularly of a terrorist nature,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;There can be no peace without security and there can be no security without peace,&quot; the crown prince said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's talks with Prince Hassan had not been expected to yield a breakthrough. The right-wing Israeli leader is due to meet King Hussein in Jordan next week.</p>
<p>After the Jerusalem attack, Netanyahu suspended a resumption of Israel-PLO talks at committee level on so-called confidence-building measures such as the opening of air and sea ports in Gaza.</p>
<p>At the news conference, Netanyahu compared his crackdown on Palestinians over &quot;terrorism&quot; to U.S. sanctions against Libya over its alleged support for extremist violence.</p>
<p>Crown Prince Hassan publicly challenged the analogy.</p>
<p>&quot;With all due respect, I want to make the remark that United States policies towards Libya are not directly relevant to Israeli-Palestinian relations,&quot; he said.</p>
