<title>RUSSIA: Yeltsin to chair key security meeting - Kremlin.</title>
<headline>Yeltsin to chair key security meeting - Kremlin.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-02-10</dateline>

<p>President Boris Yeltsin, returning slowly to work after a long illness, will chair a meeting of his Security Council in coming weeks to discuss the situation in the volatile north Caucasus, the Kremlin press service said on Monday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 66, has held a series of one-on-one meetings since he was taken ill with pneumonia last month but has not headed any committee sessions or atended public meetings.</p>
<p>The next meeting of the Security Council, a policy body grouping senior ministers and the heads of both houses of parliament, is due at the end of February or beginning of March.</p>
<p>Yeltsin was absent from the Kremlin for most of the second half of last year with heart problems and he has looked stiff in recent television appearances.</p>
<p>His absence has fueled opposition charges that Russia is rudderless, although aides insist he is controlling affairs of state and meeting officials at the secluded Gorky-9 residence outside Moscow.</p>
<p>The press service said Yeltsin asked Security Council Secretary Ivan Rybkin to represent him at Wednesday's inauguration of Chechen president Aslan Maskhadov in the regional capital Grozny.</p>
<p>Maskhadov, elected on January 27 with a large majority, says he is seeking full independence for his Caucasus region. He headed the rebel forces during their 21-month war against Russian troops.</p>
<p>Russia pulled its soldiers out of the region last month, but insists that Chechnya is still part of the Russian Federation.</p>
