<p>The Russian Trading System 24-share index rose 3.5 percent to close at a record 288.49 on $56.06 million turnover for the entire market, the NAUFOR brokers association said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The flow of funds into the market since the beginning of the year has stunned operators and led some to fear a correction.</p>
<p>The index closed at 186.94 on December 23.</p>
<p>&quot;The risks are so high right now, so everyone is trying to fix their profits for the day in the morning, or even at the second half of the day,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>But many operators said new foreign investors who had waited months to enter the market were buying on expectations of long-term growth.</p>
<p>New investors were less concerned with new price levels and quick appreciation of the market than were experienced Russia buyers, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is being driven by a wall of money,&quot; Diggle said.</p>
