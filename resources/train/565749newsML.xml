<headline>Solana says working hard on Russian-NATO deal.</headline>

<p>NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said on Wednesday he was doing his best to solve differences between the Western defence alliance and Russia, and still hoped they would sign a new partnership agreement on May 27.</p>
<p>Solana was speaking in Ukraine one day after inconclusive talks with Russia on the terms of a new post-Cold War relationship and after the Kremlin demanded further compromise from NATO.</p>
<p>Asked if he expected the deal with Moscow would be signed later this month, Solana told a news conference: &quot;I don't know. I can tell you what would be my wish. My wish very clearly would be yes.</p>
<p>&quot;But of course in order to be able to have that ceremony in Paris requires an agreement of two. I am trying to do my best.&quot;</p>
<p>Solana repeated that he and Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov had made progress in the latest round of talks in Luxembourg on Tuesday but added: &quot;Still there are a few things on which we have to continue working. We will do so.&quot;</p>
<p>A Kremlin spokesman said in Moscow earlier on Wednesday that more talks were planned with Solana in the Russian capital next Tuesday.</p>
<p>These talks could help pave the way for Yeltsin to attend a NATO summit in Madrid in July at which the Western defence alliance will open the door to some ex-Warsaw Pact members.</p>
<p>Asked whether Yeltsin would attend the summit, Solana said: &quot;We have not decided what will be the format of the invitation for the partners to the summit in Madrid but in any case all the partners, countries, will be invited.&quot;</p>
<p>Moscow, still stung by its post-communist loss of superpower status, had previously ruled out Yeltsin's participation in the Madrid summit where Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are expected to receive invitations to join the alliance.</p>
<p>Solana, who is seeking parallel deals with Russia and Ukraine which will outline NATO's new relationship with them, brought a draft document to Kiev and opened an information centre designed to reduce lingering suspicions of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the former Soviet republic.</p>
