<p>Sri Lanka's privatisation programme is on track despite last week's re-nationalisation of seven state ventures, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This (repossession) will give a fillip to the whole privatisation process since it will give an opportunity to rehabilitate some of the enterprises...,&quot; said Ananda Weerasinghe, director-general of the Public Enterprises Reform Commission (PERC).</p>
<p>The PERC is the government's privatisation arm.</p>
<p>The seven firms are Hingurana Sugar Industries, Kantalai Sugar Industries, Mattegama Textile Mills, graphite company Kahatagaha Mines, State Fertilizer Manufacturing Company, Sri Lanka State Trading (Hardware) Corporation and CCC Fertilizers.</p>
<p>The government says it used the Rehabilitation of Public Enterprises Act to take over the firms because of suspected mismanagement and plundering of company assets by investors.</p>
<p>&quot;This law cannot not be used in future,&quot; Weerasinghe said.</p>
<p>&quot;It will be used only to rehabilitate ailing companies (privatised by the previous government) for a limited time frame and does not apply to any privatisations done by PERC.&quot;</p>
<p>The government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga came to power after winning general elections in August 1994, ending the 17-year-rule of the United National Party.</p>
<p>The Rehabilitation act enables the present government to repossess privatised state ventures, especially when there are threats to employee interests. The government has to compensate the original buyer.</p>
<p>Weerasinghe said many of the 45 ventures privatised by the previous UNP government were in difficulty, with some unable to pay wages.</p>
<p>&quot;The criticism against the previous privatisations was that they were done in an unplanned and haphazard manner,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Kumaratunga told a rally on Saturday that 10,000 workers lost their jobs after the seven firms were sold at virtually give-away prices. They would be reinstated and the firms privatised again, she said.</p>
<p>Econsult, a private think-tank, said in a report on Monday the government could ill afford to deviate from its policy since its credibility with multilateral lending agencies rested on its performance on privatisation.</p>
<p>&quot;The problem of the widening budget deficit, placing greater dependence on the revenues generated by privatisation, leaves the government little choice other than to push ahead as best as possible with its privatisation programme...,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The Indian Ocean island is restructuring or privatising loss-making and badly run public enterprises, under a programme which includes bringing private management into the national airline, Airlanka, and to the telecommunications operator, Sri Lanka Telecom.</p>
<p>The exercise has met opposition from labour unions partly because of the negative image created by the previous government's irregular sale of state ventures, officials said.</p>
<p>Kumaratunga's People's Alliance government had set a more modest target this year for the proceeds from privatisation -- five billion rupees ($88 million) -- after earnings from the sale of state ventures fell far below expectations in the previous two years.</p>
<p>The government earned only 4.4 billion rupees ($77 million) in 1996, against a target of 21 billion rupees ($368 million).</p>
