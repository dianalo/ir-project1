<p>The poverty rate for young children in America climbed 39 percent from 1979-1994, and was growing nearly twice as fast in the suburbs as the cities, a study said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Columbia University's National Center for Children in Poverty found one in four children under age six lived in poverty. Nearly half of all young children lived in poor families or families near the official poverty level of $15,141 for a family of four in 1994.</p>
<p>The poverty rate for young children grew twice as fast for whites as for blacks from the late 1970s to early 1990s. But the poverty rate for young Hispanic children rose the most rapidly -- climbing 43 percent over the period measured.</p>
<p>Having a worker in the family was no guarantee a child would fare well. The poverty rate for young children in two-parent families, with one parent working full-time, grew to 15 percent from 6 percent in 1975.</p>
<p>Nearly two-thirds of the young poor lived with at least one parent or relative who worked part- or full-time.</p>
<p>&quot;The figure that surprised me the most was the increase in child poverty among families that are kind of the Ozzie and Harriet families, two parents living together and working,&quot; said Dr. Lawrence Aber, director of the Center.</p>
<p>&quot;The skills and education that are required to get a non-poverty job are increasing out of the reach of some young parents,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>A recent Census Bureau study found a 1.1 percent drop in poverty rates for children under age 18 in 1995. The new study calls the 1995 Census report, which showed a 0.8 percent drop in poverty for young children, statistically insignificant.</p>
<p>The Center found the number of young children under age six in poverty grew to 6.1 million from 3.5 million during 1979-1994. Another 4.8 million children were near poverty.</p>
<p>The number of young children in extreme poverty, defined as incomes below 50 percent of poverty, doubled to 12 percent.</p>
<p>Poor young children are more likely to be born at a low birthweight, face hospitalization during childhood, die early and experience developmental delays.</p>
<p>The Center in 1990 issued a report that said young children under age six were more likely to be poor than older children or the elderly. It issued the new study, in part, as a basis for evaluating the impact of the new welfare law.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton this summer signed a welfare bill that ends a six-decade federal guarantee of aid, limits federal benefits to five years and requiring work after two years.</p>
<p>Advocates for the poor have predicted the law could push a million children into poverty, though supporters deny it will have such far-reaching impacts. Clinton wants to alter some provisions cutting Food Stamps and aid to legal immigrants.</p>
<p>Aber said the increase in poverty among children of working parents indicates a need to go far beyond the welfare bill to address child poverty in the United States.</p>
<p>The new study found 30 percent of young black children lived in extreme poverty, compared to 6 percent of white kids.</p>
