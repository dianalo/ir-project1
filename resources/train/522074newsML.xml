<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai closed mixed on Friday after Beijing announced that a central state debt depository had been set up in Beijing, traders said.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most actively traded seven-day contract rose to 10.50 percent from 9.08 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>Total turnover of the six-contract market fell sharply to 5.3 million lots from 11 million.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.  </p>
<p>Local media said China had set up a national state debt depository in which all investors and institutions are required to deposit their treasury debt certificates from now on.</p>
<p>The new depository, China Government Securities Depository Trust and Clearing Co, will be responsible for holding, clearing and settling all state debt transactions, the media said.</p>
<p>Traders said the new depository was likely to pull down trading volume on the Shanghai market.</p>
<p>&quot;Among other things, institutions will not be able to borrow funds from different securities exchanges using the same state debt centificate as they have done up to now,&quot; said a trader.  </p>
<p>But there was a domestic A share issue on the Shenzhen stock exchange today, which boosted demand for short-term funds, give support particularly to the seven-day contract, traders said.</p>
<p>The rates are likely to go up slightly next week because of a number of new issues on both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, traders said.</p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended mixed on Friday despite high yields for existing contracts with the active stock markets and the recent state debt issues sucking funds out of the spot market, traders said.  </p>
<p>The most actively traded three-year bond that matures in August 1999 rose to 107.34 yuan from 107.20 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the seven-contract market plunged to 593,483 lots from 1.6 million lots.</p>
<p>Traders said the contracts had the potential to rise next week given the high yields.</p>
