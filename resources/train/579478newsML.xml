<title>USA: KCBT wheat ends mostly higher on late spec buying.</title>
<headline>KCBT wheat ends mostly higher on late spec buying.</headline>
<dateline>KANSAS CITY, Mo. 1997-05-13</dateline>

<p>KCBT hard red winter wheat futures settled mostly higher and well above their intraday lows on late speculative buying, traders said.</p>
<p>Wheat opened lower on follow-through technical selling from Monday's weak close and on pressure from Monday's crop progress reports, which contained improved ratings for HRW wheat in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas.</p>
<p>The July contract fell as low as $4.16-3/4 per bushel Tuesday morning after support was breached at $4.20. But wheat firmed at the midsession as buying by local traders fueled a short-covering rally.</p>
<p>&quot;The ensuing... rally was warranted from a technical standpoint and was also exaggerated by the fact that (CBOT) beans and corn moved higher on the day,&quot; a KCBT trader said.</p>
<p>Traders also said wheat values drew support from concern over ongoing dryness in western Kansas.</p>
<p>KCBT wheat settled four cents per bushel lower to eight cents higher, with new crop July up 3-3/4 cents at $4.28-1/4. May gained eight cents to settle at $4.58.</p>
<p>Featured players included commodity brokers FIMAT Futures, which bought two million July bushels. E. D. &amp; F. Man International sold two million July bushels.</p>
