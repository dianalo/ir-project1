<title>FRANCE: Prosecutors seek life in jail for ETA's Frenchmen.</title>
<headline>Prosecutors seek life in jail for ETA's Frenchmen.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1997-06-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>A French state prosecutor asked Paris' assize court on Tuesday to jail for life three suspected members of ETA's notorious &quot;French commando&quot;, one of the Basque guerrilla organisation's bloodiest groups.</p>
<p>Prosecutor Gino Necchi requested the maximum sentence against French Basques Jean Parot, 46, Jacques Esnal, 46, and Frederic Haramboure, 43, who are accused of involvement in most of the squad's attacks.</p>
<p>It made raids into Spain in 1978-1989 and is held responsible for killing 37 people, including 10 senior Spanish army and navy officers, two magistrates, a businessman who refused to pay ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) &quot;revolutionary taxes&quot; and several passers-by.</p>
<p>In its bloodiest attack, the squad bombed a Civil Guard barracks in Saragossa in 1987, killing 11 people, including children, and wounding 78.</p>
<p>The prosecutor requested heavy prison sentences against three other suspected members of the commando: 14 years for Jean-Pierre Erremundeguy, 42, and 12 years each for Jean-Vincent Garcia, 42, and Philippe Saez, a 38-year-old monk.</p>
<p>Saez had joined a monastery before being arrested.</p>
<p>The defendants face multiple charges of murder and conspiracy in terrorism. ETA has killed some 800 people in its three-decade-old campaign for a Basque state independent from Madrid.</p>
<p>ETA's only squad made up of non-Spaniards, the &quot;French commando&quot; was smashed after its presumed leader, Henri Parot, was arrested in 1990 as he drove a car loaded with 323 kilos of explosives into Seville which was then preparing to host the 1992 World Fair.</p>
<p>Spanish police believe the explosives were intended to blow up the city's police headquarters. Parot is being held in Spain and Spanish authorities have turned down a request from the Paris court to summon him as a witness.</p>
<p>The court's verdict is expected by the end of the week.</p>
