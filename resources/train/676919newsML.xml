<p>Israeli soldiers firing rubber bullets wounded about 20 Palestinians on Friday during a seventh day of street battles with Arab demonstrators in the divided West Bank town of Hebron, witnesses said.</p>
<p>One 18-year-old Palestinian youth was shot and seriously wounded in the head and doctors at al-Ahli hospital struggled to save his life, officials said.</p>
<p>Witnesses said demonstrators hurled hundreds of fire bombs at Israeli troops, setting ablaze a room where soldiers were sheltering but none was hurt. Firefighters put out the flames.</p>
<p>The witnesses said a small crowd of about 100 Arab stone-throwers ignited the clashes. The group soon swelled to hundreds of youths.</p>
<p>One witness said a soldier was hurt when a stun grenade he was trying to throw at demonstrators fell near him. They said other soldiers took him to one of several Jewish settler enclaves in the Israeli-controlled part of the town.</p>
<p>Youths taunted soldiers by running with a blue-and-white Israeli flag they had set on fire. They also torched two American flags, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The Hebron clashes began last Saturday after a U.S. congressional vote demanding that President Bill Clinton recognise Arab East Jerusalem, viewed by Palestinians as the capital of their future state, as part of Israel's capiptal.</p>
<p>More than 100 Palestinians have been shot and wounded by rubber bullets in six days of violence along the dividing line. Several Israeli soldiers have been hurt.</p>
<p>Palestinians said that unlike on previous days, when most of the stone-throwers were children aged between 10 and 15, many of the demonstrators on Friday were adults.</p>
<p>The clashes underscored tensions over a three-month impasse in Israeli-Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) peace moves and Israel's expansion of Jewish settlement in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Israel handed over 80 percent of Hebron, the southernmost West Bank city, to Palestinian self-rule in January but kept troops behind to guard some 400 Jewish settlers living or studying in the remaining 20 percent.</p>
<p>The first casualty on Friday was a young man who stood next to a demonstrator concealing his face with a chequered black and white Arab headdress and wore the red, white, black and green Palestinian national colours, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said one soldier aimed at the demonstrator but hit the person standing next to him in the leg.</p>
