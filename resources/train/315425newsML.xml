<p>Enron Corp said recommendations from the Oregon Public Utilities Commission staff are being reviewed with Portland General Corp, and the companies are prepared to begin settlement discussions next week.</p>
<p>&quot;The most significant factor is that the staff has recommended approval of the merger,&quot; Enron said in a statement. &quot;While the approval has a number of conditions attached to it, we don't want to over analyze the dollar figures attached to the recommendations that remain preliminary at this stage.&quot;  </p>
<p>Enron said the commission has scheduled settlement conferences in the proceeding for January 22-24 and will issue a final recommendation and a proposed order on January 31.</p>
<p>The commission is scheduled to make a final decision on March 17.</p>
<p>&quot;We are extremely pleased that the staff did not use this proceeding to settle industry-wide restructuring issues,&quot; said Portland General Electric senior vice president Al Alexanderson. &quot;It further endorses the support we received for the merger just last week from a wide ranging group of ... natural resource and public interest groups.&quot;</p>
<p>Enron said the companies believe &quot;the staff's methodology and assumptions on certain conditions ... raise fundamental policy issues.&quot;</p>
<p>Stating &quot;we are in the middle of a complex procedure,&quot; Enron said &quot;it would be premature to provide further detail on our position on on these issues until we have had an opportunity to discuss them directly with the staff.&quot;</p>
