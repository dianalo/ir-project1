<p>A decision by the Dickinson School Board to change the name and dwarf-like logo of the high school's &quot;Midget&quot; mascot has torn this North Dakota town apart.</p>
<p>At least 400 Dickinson residents were expected to meet on Tuesday to debate the issue.</p>
<p>Dickinson School Board President Earl Abrahamson said when the board voted to change the midget name and logo that featured a short, squat, mean-looking character, few residents complained.</p>
<p>But the move sparked a storm of protest from what Abrahamson called &quot;die-hard fans&quot; of the 80-year-old mascot.</p>
<p>&quot;People have gotten very upset over the change,&quot; Abrahamson said. &quot;I wish they'd get as excited about real issues like alcohol, drugs and teenage pregnancy.&quot;</p>
<p>Abrahamson said the board will listen to comments and make a decision after Tuesday's meeting. He said a new name and logo had not yet been picked.</p>
