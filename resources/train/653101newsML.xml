<p>China's retail price inflation rose by a year-on-year 0.8 percent in May, the State Statistical Bureau said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>That compared with a 1.1 percent increase in April, a 1.7 percent rise in March and 2.9 percent in February.</p>
<p>Among China's provinces and municipalities, the two biggest declines in retail prices were registered in Shanghai, where prices rose by 1.6 percent, and in southern Guangdong province where retail price inflation rose 1.1 percent, it said.</p>
<p>However, inflation in the capital, Beijing, was 4.3 percent while southwestern Sichuan province saw inflation at 3.7 percent, the two highest rates in China, the bureau said in a report issued by the Xinhua news agency.</p>
<p>China has been fighting to rein in inflation after the retail price index soared to a communist-era high of 21.7 percent in 1994. Benchmark retail price inflation was 14.8 percent in 1995 and fell to 6.1 percent last year.</p>
<p>China's official goal for retail price inflation this year is 6.0 percent but economists have said the figure for the year could be as low as 3.0 percent.</p>
