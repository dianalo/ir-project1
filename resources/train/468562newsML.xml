<p>Czech coach Dusan Uhrin on Wednesday named a 19-man squad for next week's World Cup qualifier against Yugoslavia, sticking mainly to the line-up that propelled the Czechs to the Euro 96 finals.</p>
<p>Fourteen members of the Euro 96 team were chosen to represent the Czechs, who badly need a win in Prague on April 2 to keep pace with the rest of European group six.</p>
<p>Spain lead the group with 13 points after five matches, followed by the Yugoslavs on 12 points, also from five matches. Slovakia, with nine points from four matches, are also ahead of the Czechs who have four points from three games, including a 1-0 loss in Belgrade in November.</p>
<p>&quot;Everybody knows what's riding on this game and the players have promised to play with the unity and strength that we showed in England last summer,&quot; Uhrin said.</p>
<p>&quot;We know that that success is in the past though and must look to the future,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Uhrin's biggest concern remains his attack, which has failed to put pressure on opposing defences throughout the qualifying round.</p>
<p>Sparta Prague's Vratislav Lokvenc has been called up for his first cap in more than a year to replace veteran Radek Drulak, who continues to lead the Czech first division scoring race despite a winter break transfer to FC Linz in Austria.</p>
<p>Liverpool's Patrik Berger will be relied upon heavily to control play, especially in the midfield, while Manchester United's Karel Poborsky is showing signs of returning to form after a disappointing stretch in the English premiership.</p>
<p>Uhrin is expected to pick West Ham goalkeeper Ludek Miklosko rather than the more experienced Newcastle keeper Pavel Srnicek.</p>
<p>Squad:</p>
<p>Goalkeepers - Ludek Miklosko (West Ham), Pavel Srnicek (Newcastle United)</p>
<p>Defenders - Miroslav Kadlec (Kaiserslautern), Jan Suchoparek (Racing Strasbourg), Michal Hornak (Sparta Prague), Tomas Repka (Sparta Prague), Karel Rada (Sigma Olomouc)</p>
<p>Midfielders - Radek Bejbl (Atletico Madrid), Karel Poborsky (Manchester United), Radoslav Latal (Schalke 04), Jiri Nemec (Schalke 04), Patrik Berger (FC Liverpool), Petr Nedved (Lazio), Martin Frydek (Sparta Prague), Martin Cizek (Sparta Prague)</p>
<p>Forwards - Vladimir Smicer (Racing Lens), Pavel Kuka (Kaiserslautern), Horst Siegl (Sparta Prague), Vratislav Lokvenc (Sparta Prague).</p>
