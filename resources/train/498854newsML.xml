<p>Chicago Federal Reserve Bank President Michael Moskow said on Thursday that the Federal Open Market Committee hiked interest rates last month to sustain the U.S. expansion, which is now in its seventh year.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on the demand level in the economy, the spending level of the economy, we felt it was important to take a step now to maintain this expansion that we've had,&quot; said Moskow, responding to questions after a speech in Dana Point, California.  </p>
<p>&quot;It takes six months, nine months, a year before monetary policy has an impact on the economy, so we're always looking ahead,&quot; Moskow said. &quot;What the Federal Open Market Committee did in its last meeting is look ahead to the future.&quot;</p>
<p>The FOMC raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.50 percent on March 25.</p>
<p>In response to a question about the labor market, Moskow said, &quot;I think we're in the type of economy where there are lots of jobs available if people want to participate.&quot;</p>
