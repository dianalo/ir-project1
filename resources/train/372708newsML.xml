<p>Democratic Sen. Wendell Ford Wednesday proposed legislation to reduce the capital gains tax based on the length of time an investment is held.</p>
<p>The tax would fall by two percent for each full year an investment was held. Assets held more than one year would be taxed at 28 percent. The rate would drop to 14 percent for those held more than eight years. The investor would have a choice of using either current law or the new phased-in rate, whichever yielded a lower tax payment.</p>
<p>Ford, of Kentucky, who is Senate Democratic Whip, said in a statement that his proposal was designed to aid the middle class, farmers and small business owners.</p>
<p>Republicans who control Congress have said they would press for much broader capital gains relief and would like the tax rate cut in half to 19 percent regardless of the length of time an investment is held before sale.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Democratic leaders have said some rate reduction should be given to farmers and small businesses.</p>
<p>President Clinton proposed a more modest capital gains plan which would exempt most home sales from the tax. However, it would benefit those over age 55 who currently have some exemption from the tax.</p>
