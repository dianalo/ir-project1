<p>Taiwan's indirect investment in China fell an annual 1.9 percent in January-July to $771.88 million after the government's call to slow investment there, the Investment Commission said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The commission said it had approved 332 investment projects in the communist mainland in the four-month period.</p>
<p>In July alone it approved 89 investment projects in rival China -- an increase of 32 cases over June. The amount of investment in July totalled $276.090 million, up 161.67 percent over the preceding month.</p>
<p>Investments focused mainly on Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong, Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, with major investments in electronics and electrical appliances, mineral products, chemicals, food and beverage, and basic metal industries, it said.</p>
<p>Taiwan has banned direct investment and trade with China since a civil war split them in 1949.</p>
<p>Since a political thaw began in the late 1980s, some 30,000 Taiwan firms have poured more than US$30 billion into the mainland, making Taiwan one of China's top overseas investors and China one of Taiwan's most important markets.</p>
<p>Increased political and even military tensions in the past two years have prompted Taiwan's Nationalist government to call for more caution in mainland investing, warning that the island must not become over dependent on its adversary's economy.</p>
