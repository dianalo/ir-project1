<headline>RTRS - BHP says settles resource rent tax dispute.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-11-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd and Esso Australia Resources Ltd, a subsidiary of Exxon Corp, said on Wednesday they had reached agreement with the Victoria state government to resolve a tax dispute.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, BHP and Esso will split a settlement of about A$1 billion. BHP said its share would be about A$511 million which would result in an after tax profit of A$167 million.  </p>
<p>BHP said A$107 million of the A$167 million related to the period to October 31, 1996, and the balance related to gas to be supplied over the remainder of the current contracts.</p>
<p>The petroleum resource rent tax was imposed by the federal government on Bass Strait gas production from July 1990. The dispute centred on whether BHP and joint venturer Esso had the right to pass on the tax under contracts with Victorian government-owned entities GASCOR and Generation Victoria.</p>
<p>BHP said the settlement was conditional on final tax and regulatory clearances and the execution of an agreement between the state and federal government.  </p>
<p>BHP said resolution of the dispute had enabled the restructuring of the gas supply contract with GASCOR to allow greater competition in the south-east energy market.</p>
<p>&quot;The new contract with GASCOR enables BHP and Esso to supply gas directly to customers in Victoria and also opens the way for Bass Strait gas to be sold interstate,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>BHP Petroleum marketing president Jim Caffrey said the resolution of the dispute removed a critical barrier to gas reform in Victoria, and would assist plans by BHP and Westcoast Energy Australia to build a pipeline to supply Bass Srait gas to New South Wales.  </p>
<p>Caffrey said shareholders would benefit by recovery of a portion of the past and expected future resource rent payments, and through the opportunity to sell Bass Strait gas into new markets.</p>
<p>Esso and BHP would maintain existing gas supplies to GASCOR, which will commit to take 180 petajoules a year between 1996 and 2000.</p>
<p>The price of gas supplied to GASCOR would be held at present levels until 2001 for domestic supplies and 2000 for industrial supplies.  </p>
<p>After these dates, gas prices would be based on market conditions.</p>
