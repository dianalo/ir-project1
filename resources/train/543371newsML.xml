<p>* Lithuanian shares eased in light trade on Monday and no end was seen to the slump.</p>
<p>* The official list index lost 12.72 points to close at 926.63 while the Litin A index slipped 11.82 points to 2,330.42.</p>
<p>* Overall market volume was around 3.4 million litas.</p>
<p>* The central market turned over a sluggish 908,000 litas while the secondary T-bill market was a dull 1,989 litas.</p>
<p>* Electronics component producer Vilniaus Vingis saw over 2.3 million litas worth of its shares swapped in a block trade and dealers said a foreign investor was trying to take a substantial stake in the firm.</p>
<p>The share price for the block trade was 5.25 litas, a bit lower than the 5.33 litas which the company's shares were trading for on the central market.</p>
<p>* Vilniaus Bank was one of the session's few gainers, rising to 235.00 litas from 232.00 litas in trade of 117,500 litas.</p>
<p>Lithuanian shares eased in light trade on Monday and the mood among dealers was far from bullish.</p>
<p>&quot;This market won't rally this week,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>External factors putting a damper on the country's struggling bourse included the strong dollar, which the Lithuania litas is pegged to at a rate of four to one.</p>
<p>Dealers said companies which rely heavily on exports could be hit by the strong dollar, lowering their share price.</p>
<p>Closer to Vilnius, external factors were mixed. Estonian share prices eased while the market in neighbouring Latvia showed signs of recovery after last week's lows.</p>
<p>The market's biggest transaction involved a 2.3 million litas block trade Vilniaus Vingis shares. Dealers said a foreign investor was snapping up shares in the electronics components producer but could not name the buyer.</p>
<p>The share price on the block trade was 5.25 litas, slightly lower than the 5.33 litas which the company's shares were going for on the central market.</p>
<p>Vilniaus Bank was of the session's few gainers, rising to 232.00 litas from 227.00 litas in trade of 117,500 litas.</p>
<p>Siauliu Bank eased for the second straight day, falling to 90.00 litas from 100.00 litas in trade of only 1,710.00 litas.</p>
<p>Its price soared during a four-session bull-run last week which was sparked by Hermis Bank's announcement that it wanted to acquire 51 percent of its shares.</p>
<p>&quot;Siauliu seems to have risen a little too far and too fast,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
