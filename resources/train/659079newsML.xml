<p>Russian shares were left beached on Friday as investors focused on Wall Street gains, traders said, predicting low volumes and a flat day of trading overall.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index of 22 shares was 364.22 at 0800 GMT, slightly off the 365.26 closing index on Wednesday, the last day shares traded before a market holiday on Thursday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Dow Jones index stormed to 7,711.47 on Thursday, its fifth record finish in as many days, fuelled by investor optimism on the economic climate, but traders said the Russian market would have to wait for the profits to flow east.</p>
<p>&quot;Things are going too well over there -- who needs Altai Telecom when you can have AT&amp;T?&quot; said Peter Kizenko, chief equities trader at ING Barings, saying the market would continue to go sideways during the day.</p>
<p>&quot;The big managers are now concentrating on the U.S. Overall this is going to be good for the Russian market, but we'll have to wait for the U.S. to cool down.&quot;</p>
<p>National power company UES  EESR.RTS eased to $0.3151 at 0900 GMT from Wedneday's closing $0.3155. Oil company LUKoil LKOH.RTS firmed to $15.70 from $15.60.</p>
<p>Renaissance Capital trader Vladimir Chkikvadze said second and third tier stocks, which have been steaming ahead in a generally quiet market in recent days, were also quieter.</p>
<p>Traders saw the market unchanged at the end of the day, although ICFI (Bank MFK) senior trader Alexei Abdurakhimov said a downward correction next week was possible.</p>
<p>&quot;We're at a breakthrough point,&quot; Abdurakhimov said. &quot;Speculators are not being very aggressive and prices aren't going either up or down. I think next week things will gradually fall off.&quot;</p>
