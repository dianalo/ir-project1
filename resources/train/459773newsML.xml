<p>An American cigarette company's admission that smoking was addictive and could cause cancer will not stamp out a strong taste for tobacco in southern and eastern Europe but it has prompted some investors to pause for breath.</p>
<p>Smoking remains a treasured pastime in countries such as Greece, France and Romania. Liggett's decision was unlikely to stop smokers, analysts said, but it did put a dent in the shares of some cigarette companies.</p>
<p>Shares in European tobacco giant B.A.T Industries shrugged off the U.S. news after an early tumble.</p>
<p>But in Athens, Greek cigarette firm Papastratos saw shares drop 55 drachmas to 5,045 on Friday. A spokesman quickly dismissed the fall as coincidence.</p>
<p>&quot;We have no idea what this Liggett case is about,&quot; he said. The shares in Greece's other listed tobacco company, Karelia, ended unchanged at 6,900.</p>
<p>Greece leads in per capita cigarette consumption followed by Japan, Poland, Switzerland and South Korea. On average, Greeks suck up more than 2,700 cigarettes a year.</p>
<p>In France, smoking remains a sacred pastime but tobacco consumption has been on a decline since 1991, when it peaked at 97.1 billion cigarettes.</p>
<p>French consumption slumped to 86.2 billion cigarettes in 1996, largely because of a growing anti-smoking movement and sharply higher prices.</p>
<p>Several tobacco industry spokesmen noted that taxes on cigarettes were much higher in Europe, and went to paying for more progressive state health system.</p>
<p>Kalle Soikkanen, legal counsel of Amer Tobacco Ltd, part of Finnish sporting goods group Amer-yhtyma Oy, said: &quot;In Finland, taxes account for some 76 percent of the price of cigarretes, and that is far more than Liggett now has to pay.&quot;</p>
<p>In a legal settlement, Liggett agreed to pay 25 percent of its pre-tax profits for the next quarter of a century to 22 U.S. states.</p>
<p>Unlike the United States, where the anti-smoking campaign borders on a religious crusade, many European countries have a different attitude.</p>
<p>The French widely ignore laws which ban smoking in public places or require no-smoking zones in restaurants. In Greece, restaurants and cafes operate in a haze of cigarette smoke.</p>
<p>French courts have allowed just two suits against French cigarette monopoly Seita. In the southern city of Bexiers, the family of a young woman who died of lung cancer last October is seeking more than a million francs ($175,000) in damages.</p>
<p>The case alleges the firm sold an &quot;inherently dangerous&quot; product due to its addictive nature and its link to cancer.</p>
<p>The suits have depressed Seita's share price but officials have said they were untroubled because the cases lacked serious legal grounds and the price would recover.</p>
<p>In Romania, the second largest tobacco consumer in Eastern Europe after Poland, Western cigarettes have always been a status symbol. In communist times, a pack of Kent was as good as hard currency.</p>
<p>Heavy smoking continued after the 1989 fall of communism despite lowering purchasing power as craved-for Western brands hit the market where an estimated six million people, or a quarter of the population, smoke 21 billion cigarettes yearly.</p>
<p>Romania, where health warnings are almost unknown, is seen by some big tobacco companies as fertile ground to grow sales.</p>
<p>RJR committed $40 million to a plant near Bucharest, while British American Tobacco proposed a $70 million investment to build a plant north of Bucharest.</p>
<p>Greece's Papastratos plans to spend about $4 million in modernising a cigarette plant near the border with ex-Soviet Moldova.</p>
<p>In London, the shares in tobacco and insurance group B.A.T Industries Plc plunged six percent on Friday, with investors worried Liggett would reveal a &quot;smoking gun&quot; which would help prove cases against other tobacco companies.</p>
<p>The shares later recovered to stand down six pence at 483 pence at midsession. But analysts doubted any significant new information would be forthcoming from Liggett as part of its legal deal.</p>
<p>&quot;This is all hype. I can't believe Liggett has documents which the other tobacco companies don't have,&quot; tobacco shares analyst Tom Bennett of investment bank Banque Paribas said.</p>
