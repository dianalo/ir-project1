<p>The Bank of Spain caught markets off-guard on Thursday with an unexpectedly swift quarter-point reduction in its official rate, and economists say this is just the beginning of declines in the interest rate this year.</p>
<p>The central bank cut its key money market rate to six percent, a historic low, just one month after it had slashed the interest rate by 50 basis points. The Bank of Spain has steered the rate down from nine percent at the start of 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;This move was a little bit surprising for the market,&quot; said Luca Jellinek of Paribas Capital Markets in London.</p>
<p>Shares and bonds rose on the news. The 10-year bond outpaced its sturdier German counterpart and the yield drove to parity with the U.S. benchmark note for the first time ever, a sign the market sees no extra risk in Spanish over U.S. issues.</p>
<p>Economy Minister Rodrigo Rato, speaking at a seminar, attributed the reduction to a moderation in inflation but said more work needed to be done to contain prices.</p>
<p>Economists agreed, but added that the peseta's strength may also have played a key role.</p>
<p>&quot;In principle, we didn't expect it for today, although it is not a great surprise because there are many factors that explain it. In the first place, the inflation number for December was very good, but in addition, there is the peseta's strength,&quot; said Belen Mateos, economist at Analistas Financieras.</p>
<p>After months of straining at the bit, the peseta broke free last Friday and stormed through the 84.00 per mark barrier to trade at levels not seen since last May after the Bank of Spain released its frim grip and refrained from intervening.</p>
<p>Despite the reduction, it firmed slightly on Thursday. At 1300 GMT, it was trading at 83.54/55 from 83.60/62 before the interest rate reduction.</p>
<p>&quot;If inflation, which is key, continues along a good path, the central bank will continue to lower rates. Perhaps the peseta level has also influenced the decision, in order to relieve pressure, although I don't think that it will manage short-term because 25 basis points isn't very much,&quot; said Juan Antonio Mielgo, economist at the Bank of America in Madrid.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Spanish data showed inflation had moderated to end the year beneath the government's target. It was at 3.2 percent in December, well beneath the the government's mid-year target of 3.4 percent.</p>
<p>Overall inflation moderated by more than one percentage point in 1996, while underlying inflation, which strips away volatile food and energy factors to give a clearer picture of the price trend, has declined by 1.8 percentage points.</p>
<p>&quot;This measure shows that the Bank of Spain is fairly confident about the future of inflation. One will have to be more aggressive in relation to the Bank of Spain's policies this year,&quot; said Carmen Hernansanz, economist at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Many economists had expected the central bank to wait for additional inflation data mid-February before again slicing interest rates, amid hopes inflation will soon slip beneath three percent and head toward the central bank's end-1997 target of 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;We think that in a short time, by March, there will be another cut of a half point. The Bank of Spain has focused, principally, on price developments and perhaps it is anticipating favourable expectations for the evolution of prices in coming months,&quot; Mateos said.</p>
