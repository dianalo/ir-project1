<p>The race for Hong Kong's first chief executive moved into its final phase on Saturday with one of the territory's most popular figures declining to run and two contenders officially registering their bids.</p>
<p>&quot;After careful consideration of all the relevant factors governing the selection process and having consulted my senior colleagues within the civil service, I have decided not to put my name forward as a candidate for the chief executive post,&quot; Chief Secretary Anson Chan said in statement.</p>
<p>Polls have consistently placed Chan, Hong Kong's top civil servant and deputy to British Governor Chris Patten, as the people's top choice to lead the territory after it reverts to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30, 1997.</p>
<p>Popularity counts for little, however, because the territory's first post-colonial leader will be selected in December by a 400-strong selection board which in turn will be chosen by a China-appointed Preparatory Committee.</p>
<p>The committee is responsible for overseeing the transition of Hong Kong from a British colony to a Special Administrative Region of China.</p>
<p>Billionaire shipping magnate Tung Chee-hwa, who declared his intention to run and resigned as chairman from his family's shipping empire on October 18, became the first person to officially register his candidacy for the top post on Saturday.</p>
<p>&quot;My next step... is to work harder,&quot; said Tung.</p>
<p>Close on his heels was former Appeal Court judge Simon Li.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm very happy because today is a good day and a step up in my bid to become the chief executive,&quot; Li told reporters after filing his candidacy.</p>
<p>He said he would install opinion boxes across the colony in order to collect the views of Hong Kong people.</p>
<p>Tung begins his formal campaign on Sunday when he will meet the press and has plans to continue his media blitz in November with further radio and television interviews.</p>
<p>Li has wasted little time in wooing the media, giving interviews to Hong Kong and overseas media since Thursday, the day after he threw his hat into the ring.</p>
<p>Chief Justice Sir Ti Liang Yang and businessman Peter Woo, the son-in-law of late shipping magnate Sir Y.K. Pao, are also in the running. The two men and any other eligible parties have until Monday to file their candidacy.</p>
<p>A group of pro-democracy activists staged a street play outside the Preparatory Committee's office in the territory's Central business district to highlight the perceived lack of transparency in choosing Hong Kong's future leader.</p>
