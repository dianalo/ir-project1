<p>Jakarta stocks ended higher on Wednesday on a spurt of active late buying in selected financial stocks, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta composite index rose 1.55 points, or 0.24 percent, to close at 632.82 points after falling to a day low of 630.146 points.</p>
<p>Advancers led decliners by 111 to 85 with 90 issues unchanged. Total turn-over was 502 billion rupiah against 508 billion rupiah on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>&quot;Selected financial stocks dominated the active list near the close on improved sentiment following the Dow's rally yesterday and as the stocks were considered to have bottomed out,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>Financial firms Bank BNI, Lippo Life, Lippo Securities and Bank Internasional Indonesia made modest gains in active trading.</p>
<p>BNI rose 75 rupiah to 1,400 rupiah following improved market sentiment, despite reports of a dividend payment of only 13 rupiah per share for 1996, brokers said.  </p>
<p>The 13 rupiah dividend for 1996 should be seen in the context that the nominal share price is 500 rupiah and that the bank went public in late November last year, president director Widigdo Sukarman told reporters after a shareholders meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Can manufacturer Pelangi Indah closed 75 rupiah to 1,200 rupiah on market talk that the firm was likely to obtain a lucrative contract from conglomerate Astra.</p>
<p>Pelangi officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Telkom was traded at the cross board unchanged at 3,600 rupiah, with some 45 million shares traded, but details were not clear.  </p>
<p>Brokers, however, said large cross board trading of Telkom shares was possibly related to the government's expected further divestment in Telkom.</p>
<p>Matahari and Multipolar were also actively traded on the cross board, with some 15 million Matahari shares and 14 million Multipolar shares changing hands, but details were not clear.</p>
