<p>A Russian banker was stabbed to death in Cyprus after a scuffle with fellow Russians at a dinner party, police said on Friday.</p>
<p>The victim, identified as Seagei Malekhou, 29, was dead on arrival at a hospital in the southern port city of Limassol on Thursday night.</p>
<p>The killing occurred at a dinner party at the house of another Russian in the city's plush Germasoyia suburb.</p>
<p>Police have detained the host, Sergei Akaronov, and another Russian, Sergei Asqerov, for questioning. They launched a manhunt for another four Russians, visitors to Cyprus and believed to be present when Malekhou was stabbed.</p>
<p>Police said Malekhou was the manager of an offshore bank based in Limassol, but could not specify which one.</p>
<p>&quot;He was at the house with other Russians and a scuffle broke out for unknown reasons. During all the fuss one of them apparently pulled out a knife and fatally injured him in the chest,&quot; a police spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The people at the party had consumed considerable quantities of alcohol, he added.</p>
<p>The stabbing was witnessed by Malekhou's wife Irina, who fled the scene and telephoned police from a nearby house.</p>
