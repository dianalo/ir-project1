<p>A French court has jailed a man for 30 months after he took schoolchildren hostage last year, hoping in a bizarre bid of suicide by proxy that police would shoot him dead, justice sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>Nicolas Gaillard told the court he got his idea after a 1993 hostage drama in which a man wired to explosives and calling himself &quot;human bomb&quot; held children for 48 hours in a suburban Paris school until an elite police squad killed him.</p>
<p>Gaillard, carrying a pistol with blank cartridges, stormed a classroom in the Paris suburb of Clichy-la-Garenne last December. He told the court he had &quot;hoped sharpshooters would not miss me&quot;.</p>
<p>But he broke down after a few hours and released the children.</p>
<p>He had written to his parents: &quot;I wanted my death to be a success since my life was not. I am sorry I was born.&quot;</p>
<p>The Paris court sentenced him on Thursday to 30 months in prison with a further 30-month term suspended.</p>
