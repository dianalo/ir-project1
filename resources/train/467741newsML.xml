<p>Singapore gas oil swaps were weaker late afternoon on Tuesday in nervous trade as players ponder whether one local trader will continue to support the physical market in April.</p>
<p>&quot;There is some nervousness in the market, prices can come off more than a dollar if Hin Leong stops buying,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>April gas oil was last quoted at $26.50/$26.60 down from Monday's $26.90/$27.00 in quiet trading.</p>
<p>It traded earlier in the day at $26.55 per barrel, well off the intra-day traded high of $27.15 on Monday, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Physical gas oil prices rose by more than $3.00 per barrel since early March as a result of the buying spree by local trader Hin Leong who has bought more than five million barrels.</p>
<p>Traders said most people expect Hin Leong to support the market until March is over and it is the uncertainty of what would happen when this support is withdrawn that is making some people nervous.</p>
<p>They said talks that China maight limit imports in the second quarter at a time when almost one million tonnes of arbitrage cargoes are headed to the region is also making things jittery.  </p>
<p>Also Indonesia is not buying any additional cargoes on top of its regular 3.5 million barrels in April, traders said.</p>
<p>As a result the April/May time spread has widened to be last quoted at $1.00/$1.20 per barrel from around 80 cents last week.</p>
<p>The jet fuel/gas oil spread (regrade) narrowed on talks of reduced demand from Indonesia and the wide differential between the two products in the physical market.</p>
<p>Some traders said Indonesia might import less in April compared with around 1.5 million barrels in February and March.  </p>
<p>The physical regrade is currently valued at around minus 1.00 per barrel, pushing the forward April to minus 5 to plus 10 cents, brokers said.</p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps are under sell pressure with the April/May time spread narrowing to almost flat.</p>
<p>April fuel oil swaps were last quoted at $97.00/$98.00 per tonne, down from Monday's $98.50/99.50 per tonne, brokers said.</p>
<p>May was quoted at $97.00/$98.25 per tonne from Monday's $97.50/$98.00, they said. The April/May spread traded late on Monday at 35 cents per barrel and was bid earlier today at parity.  </p>
<p>Traders said lower prices were due to the emergence of fresh offers by a local trader, high stocks in Singapore and the expected arrival of more than 250,000-tonnes of arbitrage cargoes.</p>
