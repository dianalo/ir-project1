<p>Swedish automotive group Volvo said on Thursday a Dutch government ban on a permanent night shift at its co-owned Nedcar plant would not put production targets at risk.</p>
<p>&quot;The news is not a threat either to the profitability of the S40/V40 (car series) or to the production target of 65,000 cars set up for this year,&quot; Volvo spokesman Ingemar Hesslefors told Reuters.</p>
<p>Nedcar, a joint venture between Volvo Car, Mitsubishi Motors Corp and the Dutch government, said earlier it had failed to get a permit from the ministry of social affairs to introduce night shifts, which could have boosted production hours by one quarter.</p>
<p>The company aims to increase production to 280,000 cars in 1998 from a planned output of 145,000 in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;What Nedcar applied for was to introduce a permanent night shift where the workers would continuously work nights. There is still the possibility of introducing a night shift with a rolling schedule,&quot; Hesslefors.</p>
<p>Discussions would now begin between Nedcar's management and the works council, Hesslefors said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now that we've reached the end of the road with one alternative, we'll have to solve things with prevailing legislation,&quot; Hesslefors said.</p>
<p>Nedcar earlier this month applied for a licence to introduce nightshifts, saying it was vital for the company to increase its production by a quarter to 5,000 hours annually to meet its output target.</p>
<p>The ministry of social affairs said it would not give the permit to start a permanent nightshift in the Nedcar plant in the southern town of Born, as it was against the law to accept more than 28 nightshifts in 13 weeks.</p>
