<title>USA: KeyCorp CEO cites Internet security concerns.</title>
<headline>KeyCorp CEO cites Internet security concerns.</headline>

<p>Concern about security shortcomings on the Internet is one of the main reasons a group of banks has joined with International Business Machines Corp to develop their own banking network, KeyCorp president and chief executive Robert Gillespie said in a telephone interview.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Internet seems best suited for sharing information and not for conducting because of the lack of security,&quot; Gillespie told Reuters. &quot;We think the reason it has grown rather slowly in terms of commerce being conducted is because of the lack of a private secure network to do transactions on.&quot;</p>
<p>Cleveland-based KeyCorp, a bank holding company with $64.8 billion in assets, is one of 15 banks starting the Integrion Financial Network along with partner IBM.  </p>
<p>Asked to respond to comments from some computer industry analysts that there have been great strides in developing secure methods of doing business on the Internet, Gillespie said there was just &quot;too much broad access&quot; on the Internet.</p>
<p>Responding to analyst suggestions that the banks could save more money by using the Internet as opposed to developing their own system, Gillespie said technology expenditures at Keycorp &quot;won't need to go up as rapidly in the next two years as they have in the last two years.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;We think the announcement for electronic commerce is a step in that direction,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>On other subjects, Gillespie said the U.S. economoy is growing at a &quot;reasonabe pace.&quot; He continued, &quot;Frankly, we were a little surprised at the decline in the unemployment (to a 5.1 percent jobless rate).&quot;. But he added, &quot;it's very clear that the economy has got to slow in the third and fourth quarters or we'll be seeing some Fed tightening.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked to comment on the recent announcment of a $9 billion acquisition of Boatmen's Bancshares Inc by NationsBank Corp, Gillesipe said it was just a continuation of a wave of consolidations in the banking industry.</p>
<p>He said KeyCorp's acquisition focus has been and continues to be &quot;business line&quot; acquisitions such as leasing companies and student loan companies.</p>
<p>He said he was &quot;comfortable&quot; with Wall Street consensus earnings estimates of $0.95 per share for the third quarter of 1996 and $0.99 per share for the fourth quarter.</p>
