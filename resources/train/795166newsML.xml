<p>The Singapore dollar exchange rate is unlikely to have a clear-cut, one-directional, impact on trade or inflation, a Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It won't have a one directional effect,&quot; Yeo Lian Sim, director of the international department at MAS said at a briefing.</p>
<p>She said the impact would be mixed, partly because the Singapore unit had moved in different directions against major and regional currencies.  </p>
<p>The Singapore dollar had depreciated by about five percent against the U.S. dollar since the start of 1997. It had also fallen against the yen and the Taiwan dollar but it had risen against some European and regional currencies.</p>
<p>The exchange rate for the Singapore dollar was appropriate to what was happening in the market, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;The U.S. dollar has been generally strong. In that context we have moved down five percent since the beginning of the year,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>On the Singapore dollar's potential impact on trade, Yeo said the effect would also be mixed.  </p>
<p>&quot;The exchange rate is not the only factor that goes into determining import-exports,&quot; Yeo said.</p>
<p>She said demand cycles had to be considered.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of inflation, our pattern of imports is fairly spread out,&quot; Yeo said, suggesting this would minimise the effect on inflationary pressures in terms of more expensive imports for consumers.</p>
<p>She said the volatility in currency markets would not be &quot;stongly negative&quot; on inflation but this &quot;remains to be seen&quot;.  </p>
<p>The Singapore dollar fell to a three-year low on Tuesday morning of 1.5000 against the U.S. dollar after the MAS official's comments.</p>
<p>The last time the Singapore dollar reached these levels was in August 1994.</p>
