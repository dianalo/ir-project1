<title>ISRAEL: Israeli shares rise on Nasdaq gains.</title>
<headline>Israeli shares rise on Nasdaq gains.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1996-10-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Israeli shares rose across the board in very dull trading following the rise of Israeli shares traded on Nasdaq, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 1.64 percent, or 3.0 points, to 185.93 on very low turnover of 40 million shekels.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 index gained 1.65 percent to 196.21.</p>
<p>&quot;The market rose today but activity was extremely low. The market's recovery was first of all an outcome of the rise of the Israeli shares traded in New York. The market was also affected by the approval Teva got from the FDA,&quot; said Danniella Finn at Batucha Securities and Investments.</p>
<p>Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, the second most active share, rose 2.75 percent to 144,239 after it said that it was informed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that it had accepted an advisory committee's recommendation concerning Teva's multiple sclerosis treatment Copaxone.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite today's rise all investors are waiting to see what will happen on the political front and how the talks with the Palestinians end,&quot; Finn said.</p>
<p>Israeli and Palestinian negotiators plan to resume talks on Sunday evening, an outcome of last week's emergency White House summit spurred by clashes that killed 73 people.</p>
<p>Nice Systems surged the maximum 10 percent to 7,181 after its shares traded on Nasdaq rose 8.1 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>Elco Industries, the main gainer on the Maof, jumped 5.5 percent to 9,041 but traders said the share rose on very low volume.</p>
<p>&quot;It is very difficult to understand why the market rose today. The only logical explanation is that it gained because of the rise of Israeli shares in New York,&quot; said a trader at Bank Leumi.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody knows how the talks with Palesinians will end. The market is waiting for political developments and there is still a feeling of uncertainty among investors,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Koor Industries, the most active share, rose 1.0 percent to 28,449 on volume of 4.0 million shekels. Bank Hapoalim gained 0.5 percent to 440 on turnover of 2.0 million shekels.</p>
