<p>Sri Lanka's economy, which saw low growth in 1996, is likely to recover in 1997 due to improved agriculture and industrial output, a recent strategy report by UBS Global Research and John Keells Stock Brokers said.</p>
<p>A crippling drought between March and August 1996, is expected to restrict gross domestic product (GDP) growth to an estimated 3.7 percent.</p>
<p>Aided by normal power supply and improvements in the manufacturing sector, which accounts for almost 20 percent of overall GDP, growth in 1997 should improve, the report said.  </p>
<p>Investors are advised to remain underweight in the hotel sector, which has been hit by a 29.5 percent drop in tourist arrivals, mainly due to the continuing ethnic conflict in the northeast.</p>
<p>An underweight position is also recommended for the motor sector, because the government has frozen public sector expenditure on the purchase of new motor vehicles due to budgetary constraints.</p>
<p>A neutral stance is recommended on manufacturing since companies in this sector are recovering from the ravages of 1996, which could depress earnings in 1997.</p>
