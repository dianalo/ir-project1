<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>

<p>Dutch shares closed higher on Tuesday, extending Monday's big gains in reaction to a firm Wall Street showing overnight and a signal that German monetary policy was likely to remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank kept a key money market rate unchanged on Tuesday morning, soothing some concern that German rates might be heading higher, and helping to bring back in buyers scared by last week's big Amsterdam and New York falls.</p>
<p>The AEX share index closed 29.97 points or 3.27 percent higher at 947.45 on brisk volume but could not hold above resistance at 950 after a session high of 954.33.  </p>
<p>&quot;The Bundesbank news this morning was positive for our market and the bond market,&quot; one dealer said. &quot;We've seen the public and the big institutions buying.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that some impetus was coming out of the options market with some operators buying calls in index shares, betting on further gains in the cash market.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people think this market could be headed back up to the old high (1,011.62 on August 7) and they don't want to get left behind,&quot; said the dealer. &quot;My view is that it could be quite quick, people could be impressed by figures this week from Aegon and ABN AMRO and start chasing the market again.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;A lot of nervous people were shaken out over the last week or so and a lot of institutions have seen it as a buying opportunity. Some of my clients seem a little less nervous about stepping back into the market,&quot; another dealer said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of demand around and people still believe in this market,&quot; the first dealer said.</p>
<p>Other market watchers, however, remain jittery after the AEX's more-than-13-percent slump from the early August trading peak to Monday's session low of around 875, spooked by the prospect the AEX bull run from 648 at the end of 1996 might be on the verge of collapsing.  </p>
<p>&quot;When you see the sort of volatility we've seen recently in the past, that has been an indication of the end of a trend. I'm not convinced we can see the old high being retaken soon and even if it is it would be a big selling trigger,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Upcoming results enlivened the financials with Aegon up 6.30 guilders to 151.00 and ABN AMRO 2.20 guilders higher at 49.20, ahead of first half announcements later this week.</p>
<p>Cyclical shares returned to favour with Akzo 11.50 up at 330.00 guilders and DSM 8.10 guilders higher at 205.20. PolyGram rose 6.40 guilders to 116.40, gaining on hopes for a new major film to be released soon.</p>
