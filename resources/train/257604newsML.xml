<p>Saudi Arabian stocks ended broadly stable in a quieter trading session last week, figures from the Riyadh-based Bakheet Financial Advisors (BFA) showed on Sunday.</p>
<p>The index was little changed at 153.85 points on Thursday from 153.91 points the previous week. Of the 62 companies traded, 19 rose, 28 slipped and 15 were unchanged.</p>
<p>Banks accounted for 48 percent of trading volume, which BFA said edged down to nearly 3.79 million shares worth almost 910 million riyals ($243 million) from the previous week's 4.83 million shares worth 1.17 billion riyals.</p>
<p>For the second week running, Riyad Bank was the most active share. It accounted for some 25 percent of volume and value traded and closed four riyals firmer at 243 riyals, BFA figures show.</p>
<p>SCECO-Southern was the biggest gainer in the week, clocking up over 15 percent to 82 riyals. Saudi Investment Bank also gained good ground, ending 10 percent up at 231 riyals.</p>
<p>On the other end of the scale, losers in the week included glass company ZOUJAJ, which ended five percent down at 143, and agriculture firm GACO and Saudi Arabian Fertiliser Co, which each closed around four percent weaker at 23 and 658 riyals respectively. ($1=3.75 riyals)</p>
