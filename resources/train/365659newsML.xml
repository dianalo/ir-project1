<p>Peruvian police surrounding the Japanese ambassador's home and Marxist rebels holding 72 hostages inside settled down on Saturday in the continuing 53-day-old siege in the absence of Peru's President, Alberto Fujimori.</p>
<p>With Fujimori flying to London for a business forum and to garner the support of Prime Minister John Major and ex-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for his stance against the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), the resumption of talks appeared stalled until his return.</p>
<p>Fujimori was expected in London on Sunday for a Latin American business forum and talks with Major on Monday and Thatcher on Tuesday, when he was to return to Peru.</p>
<p>In Lima, attention switched to security around the residence and the living conditions of the MRTA's captives.</p>
<p>&quot;We wish to express our concern for the health conditions of the hostages and especially for the state of Bolivian Ambassador Jorge Gumucio and judges and congressmen whose families have expressed their worries,&quot; said the Peruvian Association for Human Rights in a statement.</p>
<p>On the request of the hostages -- Peruvian and Japanese officials, diplomats and businessmen -- Red Cross officials took in 13 mattresses to add to 72 brought in a week ago. Before that the hostages, and presumably the 15-odd MRTA rebels, slept on blankets on the floor.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a question of comfort, not of health,&quot; Red Cross spokesman Steven Anderson told Reuters.</p>
<p>The heavily armed MRTA guerrillas who stormed the residence on Dec. 17 seizing hundreds of cocktail party guests have freed most of them, keeping government ministers, the envoys of Japan and Bolivia, local and Japanese businessmen, and Fujimori's brother, Pedro.</p>
<p>The Red Cross will not comment on the health of individual hostages but has arranged medical visits by specialists. &quot;Some need to be followed more closely than others,&quot; Anderson said.</p>
<p>About 100 friends and relatives of Peru's Deputy Minister of Mining, Juan Mendoza, one of the hostages, marched up to police cordons near the residence on Saturday demanding the MRTA release him for medical attention for a hernia.</p>
<p>&quot;Please listen, MRTA,&quot; pleaded his wife, Enriqueta, heading the rally. &quot;Free my husband because he needs an operation. I haven't spoken to anyone; I have just come to free my husband.&quot;</p>
<p>Peruvian police, who have surrounded the residence and posted sharpshooters backed up by armoured personnel carriers, were tightening security in the streets nearby by issuing identity cards to residents.</p>
<p>&quot;The accredition will be finished by Wednesday and from that day on, nobody and no vehicle will be able to enter the area without a photo-card,&quot; said Police Col. Fernando Zapata.</p>
<p>The sight of an unmarked small plane flying low over the residence added to the tension, as did the continuing psychological warfare waged by police blasting the residence with patriotic &quot;criolla&quot; folk music from huge speakers.</p>
<p>The rebels chanted revolutionary hymns and slogans. Led by Nestor Cartolini Cerpa, they are demanding the release of more than 400 comrades held in Peruvian jails in exchange for freeing the captives.</p>
<p>Fujimori has refused to discuss the demand, but has promised Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, whom he met in Canada last weekend, to try to resume dialogue broken off on Dec. 28.</p>
<p>Mediators, including Catholic Bishop Juan Luis Cipriani, met Cerpa on Thursday and said afterward the chances of new talks had &quot;advanced positively&quot;. Cipriani entered the residence on Saturday for a mass, but there were no reports of fresh talks.</p>
