<title>POLAND: Poland studies text of Swiss deal on Jewish assets.</title>
<headline>Poland studies text of Swiss deal on Jewish assets.</headline>
<dateline>WARSAW 1996-10-17</dateline>

<p>Poland's foreign ministry has a copy of an agreement signed with Switzerland on June 25, 1949, on funds deposited in Swiss bank accounts and is now studying it, the ministry spokesman told PAP news agency on Thursday.</p>
<p>Spokesman Pawel Dobrowolski was questioned about charges by U.S. Senator Alfonse D'Amato that Switzerland, in a secret 1949 deal with Warsaw, had used assets of Polish Jews murdered in the Holocaust to compensate its own citizens for property nationalised in then-Communist Poland.</p>
<p>Dobrowolski said the agreement had not so far been secret but he declined to reveal it or its details until experts had studied it from a legal perspective, PAP said.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not entirely convinced the agreements in this accord are linked with the question of compensation for the Swiss for nationalised assets,&quot; Dobrowolski said.</p>
<p>He said the copy the ministry had was a French language version but a search of archives had not yet been completed.</p>
<p>PAP said it had information, not officially confirmed, that the agreement concerned so-called &quot;dead&quot; individual accounts in Swiss banks but that it involved the transfer of these funds to a Polish bank five years after the deal was signed.</p>
<p>D'Amato is head of the Senate Banking Committee which has been probing the Swiss financial role in World War Two.</p>
<p>He told a hearing in New York on Wednesday that researchers had uncovered documents revealing the 1949 agreement between Poland and Switzerland and that similar deals had later been struck with Hungary and Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>Around 3.5 million Jews lived in Poland before World War Two, most of whom were murdered by Nazi German invaders in death camps following the invasion.</p>
<p>Legislation is now before Poland's parliament paving the way for the return of communal property such as synagogues, which were taken over by Polish communist authorities after the war, to remaining Jewish congregations which group less than 3,000 people.</p>
<p>But the government says any return of private Jewish property must be part of a still-undecided general scheme to compensate people for assets confiscated by the communists and this will only apply to resident citizens, thereby excluding many Jewish survivors who emigrated after the war.</p>
