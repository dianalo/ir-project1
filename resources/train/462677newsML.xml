<p>U.S. first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her daughter Chelsea plunge into the Tanzanian wilderness on Tuesday for a close look at East Africa's elephants, rhinos, lions and other beasts.</p>
<p>Before the fun, President Clinton's wife is to fly north from Dar es Salaam to Arusha to visit the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda.</p>
<p>The tribunal is responsible for prosecuting people responsible for genocide and other violations of international humanitarian law committed in 1994 in neighbouring Rwanda, when an estimated 500,000 Rwandans were killed in an ethnic slaughter.</p>
<p>&quot;I will be visiting the tribunal to underscore the commitment, on the part of the United States and the community of nations, to seeing to it that the perpetrators of Rwandan war crimes are brought to justice and that the horrors of genocide do not happen again,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Clintons were also to visit Olturoto, near Arusha, a Masai village working to slow the rate of AIDS infection through various community action. Tanzania estimates nearly one million of its citizens will have AIDS by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Mrs Clinton and daughter are then scheduled to depart for an area with little contact with the outside world, the Ngorongoro Crater, sometimes called &quot;the Garden of Eden&quot;.</p>
<p>It is the collapsed cone of an ancient volcano, approached by steep roads winding down from the rim. An estimated 30,000 animals live in the crater, including lions, elephants, rhinos, buffalo, gazelle, wildebeest, zebra, ostrich and flamingoes.</p>
<p>Mrs Clinton and her entourage were to spend Tuesday and Wednesday night at the Ngorongoro Serena Lodge, not even equipped with telephones.</p>
<p>From the lodge the Clintons will go on safari to the crater as well as to the Olduvai Gorge, where some of the world's most significant archaeological discoveries have been made, including a 1.75 million year old skull that Mrs Clinton took a look at on Monday in Dar es Salaam.</p>
<p>They will also visit the Serengeti plain of grasslands and woodlands, a 5,700-square mile (15,000 sq km) national park rich in wildlife.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot wait to see the Ngorongoro Crater, the Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge,&quot; Mrs Clinton said on Monday. &quot;These are places of rare beauty and tremendous scientific importance. They also highlight the challenges and the priceless benefits of protecting the global environment.&quot;</p>
<p>After their wildlife interlude, the Clintons visit Uganda and then Eritrea before returning to Washington on March 30. During their two-week goodwill tour of Africa they have already visited Senegal, South Africa and Zimbabwe.</p>
