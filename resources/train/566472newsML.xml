<p>Wayne Huizenga's bid to build a nationwide chain of megadealers hit another pothole Wednesday when American Honda Motor Co. filed a lawsuit seeking to block Republic Industries Inc.'s  acquisition of Honda and Acura dealerships in the United States.</p>
<p>American Honda, Honda Motor Co. Ltd.'s U.S. sales and marketing unit, said in the suit Republic has refused to abide by sales, service and public ownership policies that limit individual ownership of Honda and Acura dealerships.</p>
<p>Honda's action comes after Toyota Motor Corp.'s U.S. unit filed a petition with the Texas Motor Vehicle Board on April 2 to block Republic's acquisition of a Toyota dealership in Houston.</p>
<p>Honda filed its suit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. The company claims Republic wants to buy 63 Honda and Acura dealeships in the next 18 months. That could potentially equal 20 percent of Honda's U.S. total sales.</p>
<p>Honda also charged that Republic wants to create a brand image around its AutoNation chain of superstores that could hurt the Honda and Acura names.</p>
<p>&quot;We are not going to sit back and allow Republic Industries to exploit our 27 years of relationship-building with our customers and our dealers, and erode the equity in the Honda and Acura brands,&quot; said Richard Colliver, senior vice president of Honda Division automobile sales.</p>
<p>Honda does not allow a single owner to have more than seven Honda dealerships and three Acura dealerships. It also has restrictions on how many dealerships an individual owner can have in a given geographic region.</p>
<p>Honda spokesman Art Garner said the lawsuit was sparked by Republic's purchase last Friday of Honda of Miami in Florida's capital. Republic had previously bought Courtesy Acura in Orlando, Fla.</p>
<p>Like Toyota, Honda officials are sceptical of Republic's ability to operate new and used car dealerships successfully.</p>
<p>&quot;We have an obligation to our customers and dealers not to risk our future on an untested concept,&quot; said Colliver.</p>
<p>Republic has been the most aggressive of the new breed of &quot;megadealers&quot; that are shaking up the 80-year-old auto dealer franchise system. By offering large selections of high-quality used cars at no-haggle prices, superstores hope to capitalise on consumer dissatisfaction with traditional dealers.</p>
<p>A year ago, Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based Republic was mostly a waste management company. But it has since been on a buying binge that has made it the largest dealer group in the country. Automotive News last month estimated Republic had 1996 annual dealer group revenues of $5.06 billion -- double the next closest dealer group.</p>
<p>Republic spokesman Jim Donahue said Honda's suit in federal court is an attempt to bypass state motor vehicle boards. He also noted Honda has allowed the purchase of the Orlando Acura store.</p>
<p>&quot;We think the suit is without merit and we intend to defend our point of view vigorously,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Mark Mandel, an analyst at ABN-AMRO Chicago Corp, said the two sides are likely to reach a compromise.</p>
<p>&quot;The manufacturers, as much as they would like to, can't stop this whole consolidation trend,&quot; he said.</p>
