<title>IRAN: Last EU ambassador in Iran goes home.</title>

<p>The last European Union ambassador still in Iran after a row over a German court's charge of high Iranian involvement in political killings abroad went home on Monday, a Western diplomatic source said.</p>
<p>Italian ambassador Ludovico Ortona returned to Rome and the embassy was being run by a charge d'affaires, the source said.</p>
<p>He was the only one of the 15 EU ambassadors to come back to Tehran after the court's April verdict which implicated top Iranian leaders in the assassination of three dissident Kurds and their translator in Berlin's Mykonos restaurant in 1992.</p>
<p>The EU collectively withdrew its ambassadors from Tehran and suspended ministerial contacts with the Islamic republic after the verdict. Iran strenuously denied the allegations.</p>
<p>EU foreign ministers decided at a meeting three weeks later in Luxembourg that they would return their envoys to Tehran.</p>
<p>But Iran's Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said the German ambassador would not be allowed back.</p>
<p>The Italian ambassador was quick to fly back to the Iranian capital but found himself isolated from his allies pending a decision by Rome's 14 EU partners.</p>
<p>The standoff between the EU and Iran looks set to continue.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati insisted on Sunday that Germany had to &quot;rectify&quot; its mistake. The German federal prosecutor's office said last week it would not pursue an investigation into Iran's leaders, but Velayati said this was not enough.</p>
