<title>JAPAN: Text of letter by self-described Kobe killer.</title>
<headline>Text of letter by self-described Kobe killer.</headline>
<dateline>KOBE, Japan 1997-06-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>The following is the full text of a letter received by the Kobe Shimbun daily newspaper from the self-described killer of 11-year-old Jun Hase, whose severed head and body were found on May 27.</p>
<p>A Kobe police spokesman said the police believed the letter was authentic because it contained details that had not been released to the press before.</p>
<p>(Full Text)</p>
<p>To Kobe Shimbun:</p>
<p>The television happened to be on as I was going out earlier and I noticed reporters were misreading my name as &quot;Onibara&quot;.</p>
<p>There is no behaviour so foolish as reading a person's name wrong. The name written on the preceding page is not a code, puzzle, nickname or fabrication, but my real name.</p>
<p>The name was given from the moment I existed and what I was to do was already decided. But sadly I have no nationality. Up until now, people have never called me by my name.</p>
<p>If I were the same exact way as I was when I was born, I probably would not have taken the trouble to place a severed head at the front gate of a junior high school.</p>
<p>Anyone who tries can enjoy killing people furtively. As one who has led and continues to lead an invisible existence, I have gone out of my way to attract public attention because I want to be recognised as a real person, at the very least in your fantasies.</p>
<p>At the same time, I have not forgotten to take revenge on the compulsory education system which has created me as an invisible existence and the society which gave birth to this education system.</p>
<p>However, I would gain nothing from mere revenge, save unburdening myself of the load I've carried until now. So I discussed this with a friend who alone in the world is invisible like myself.</p>
<p>He said, &quot;For revenge that is worthy, rather than miserable, mix your revenge with murder -- which is your hobby, your raison d'etre and your purpose -- and enjoy it as a game. Change your hobby from murder to revenge and you will gain or lose nothing and create -- if nothing more, then nothing less than -- a new world which is yours alone.&quot;</p>
<p>Thus moved by those words, I have started this killing game.</p>
<p>But even now, I don't know why I enjoy killing. I can only say that it is in my intrinsic nature. It is only when I kill that I can be freed from daily hatreds and feel a sense of relief. It is only other people's pain that can ease my pain.</p>
<p>One final word:</p>
<p>As I believe you can understand from this letter, I am more attached to my own existence than the average person. It follows that I cannot tolerate having my name misread or having my existence defiled. Watching the moves of police, I can only think that they are purposely hiding the fact that deep down they don't want to be bothered with me. Aren't they trying to hush up my existence? I am putting my life on the line with this game. I'll probably be hanged if caught. Therefore, although I'm not going so far as to say police should risk their lives, police should pursue me with more anger and determination. If even once again my name is misread or something happens to make me unhappy, I'll destroy three vegetables a week. It is a big mistake to think that I am a childish killer who can only kill children. I possess the ability to kill the same person a second time.</p>
<p>P.S. The script in the letter I attached to the head was blurred by rain or something and was hard to read, so I'm sending along the same exact content again.</p>
