<p>Several days of bitterly cold temperatures have done little to hamper barge traffic on the Illinois River Tuesday, river officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no problem with the ice,&quot; said a U.S. Coast Guard official based in Davenport, Iowa, referring to the Illinois River. He said one barge company had reported damage to a vessel from ice, but there were approximately 28 tows running on the Illinois River.</p>
<p>Temperatures in most of the Midwest over the past several days have not climbed far above zero degrees (Fahrenheit).  </p>
<p>In Illinois, temperatures were not expected to move above 21 degrees on Tuesday, and below freezing temperatures were seen for much of the remainder of the week, according to data from Weather Express, in Omaha, Neb.</p>
<p>However, mechanical problems with various locks along the river were cited as the source for some river traffic slowdowns, officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;The LaGrange lock and dam is still restricting things a little, but otherwise, there is a lot of traffic flowing,&quot; the Coast Guard official said.</p>
<p>The LaGrange lock near Beardstown, Ill., was closed last week to undergo repair to a hydraulic lead. The lock reopened on Thursday last week.</p>
<p>&quot;No one has mentioned any problems with ice, but we still have daytime closure of Lock and Dam 24,&quot; said Ken Kruchowski, spokesman with the Army Corps. of Engineers, St. Louis District.</p>
<p>Because of the repair work on Lock 24 at Clarksville, Mo., the lock is closed from 0600 to 1800 CST each day. The repair work is not expected to be finished until February, river officials said.</p>
