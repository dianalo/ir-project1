<p>German telecommunications group Deutsche Telekom declared an advertising victory at the Tour de France where the team it sponsored not only won the race, but invaluable worldwide publicity.</p>
<p>Telekom spokesman Ulrich Lissek said the company's brand-name recognition had reached about 96 percent in Germany through its sponsorship of the cyclists, a level paralleling that of Coca-Cola.</p>
<p>&quot;The team and Telekom drew enormous support,&quot; Telekom spokesman Ulrich Lissek said of the event, where German Jan Ullrich snatched the leader's yellow jersey early on in the race and never let it go until his win in Paris on Sunday.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom spent about 10 million marks ($5.4 million) supporting the team, which Lissek said the company had more than replenished with the powerful image boost.</p>
<p>Indeed, papers across the globe featured photos of the freckle-faced Ullrich in a Telekom cap holding the victor's cup. Advertising experts have described the 23-year-old's own sponsorship potential as &quot;unlimited&quot;.</p>
<p>A crowd of 10,000 swarmed a central Bonn market square to greet Ullrich and his teammates, which Telekom had decorated with thousands of pink balloons, the company colours. Hundreds donned hot pink cycling caps with the firm's trademark &quot;T&quot;.</p>
<p>The company, however, says it has no plans to expand its sports sponsorship beyond cycling, basketball and youth soccer, Lissek said.</p>
<p>&quot;It doesn't make sense to have too much of a good thing,&quot; Lissek said. ($ = 1.842 German Marks)</p>
