<p>Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre hinted in an interview on Monday that France had cleared Algeria's most ruthless Islamic rebel group of a 1996 bomb attack on a Paris commuter train in which four people died.</p>
<p>French officials had earlier said they believed that Algeria's deadly Armed Islamic Group (GIA) -- known as the GIA -- had claimed responsibility for the December 3 blast on the train as it pulled into Paris' Port Royal station.</p>
<p>But Debre told the French daily Le Figaro that the GIA had been misunderstood in a key communication and was instead claiming responsibility for 1995 attacks in France.</p>
<p>In an April article in the Arab newspaper Al Hayat, the GIA &quot;said nothing about the Port Royal attack,&quot; Debre said in the interview, to be published in Le Figaro on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Asked about the status of France's investigation of the bombing, Debre said it had made progress &quot;and we have been able to eliminate certain avenues put forward at the beginning of the investigation&quot;.</p>
<p>It was possible the bombing might be linked to unspecified gangsters and terrorists who were working together, he said.</p>
<p>But when asked whether that meant the GIA had been eliminated as a suspect in the blast, Debre responded: &quot;You cannot deduce that from my remarks. One must not rule out any hypothesis&quot;.</p>
<p>Investigators have long been said to be working under the assumption that a series of bombing attacks in France during 1995 and 1996 were linked to fundamentalist rebels unhappy with France's tacit support for the Algerian authorities.</p>
<p>An estimated 60,000 people have died in civil violence in Algeria since the authorities canceled a 1992 election the fundamentalist Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.</p>
