<p>Australian shares opened slightly weaker on Friday after Wall Street experienced a volatile session with the Dow reversing a 96 point plunge to close only slightly weaker.</p>
<p>At 10.15 a.m. (2315 GMT), the All Ordinaries index was 2.6 points lower at 2,408.6.</p>
<p>Early trading saw blue chip issues narrowly mixed with the industrial sector slightly firmer but resources weaker despite the stronger performance of base metal prices on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has been fairly cautious this morning and it should stay this way for the rest of the day. I don't think too many people will go long into the weekend given the volatility of the Dow last night,&quot; a dealer from a Melbourne-based brokerage said.</p>
<p>The dealer said investors also had one eye on a weaker local bond market after U.S. bonds slid on a stronger than expected rise in manufacturing activity.</p>
<p>Leading the market lower were Australia's largest company BHP, and major property and finance group, Lend Lease Corp, while some banks, including ANZ, Advance and St George, found a reasonable level of buying support early.</p>
<p>At 11.10 a.m. (0010 GMT), ANZ Bank was one cent higher at A$7.95 (US$6.28), Advance shares were seven cents up at A$7.00 and St George shares up two cents at A$7.82.</p>
<p>(A$1=US$0.79)</p>
