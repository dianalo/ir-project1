<p>Hungarian oil and gas company MOL Rt on Tuesday signed an agreement with a consortium of banks to borrow $100 million loan, officials of MOL and of the two lead manager banks told a news conference.</p>
<p>The loan was oversubscribed by 1.8 times, MOL General Director Zoltan Mandoki said.</p>
<p>The syndicated loan, lead managed by ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and Bankers Trust International Plc, consists of two, equal $50 million packages, with six and seven years of maturities.</p>
<p>The six-year part of the loan, to be spent on the development of information systems of MOL's oil refinery in Szazhalombatta, bears interest of 95 basis points above LIBOR and has to be repaid after a four year grace period.</p>
<p>The seven-year tranche is designed to serve general corporate financing aims. This tranche bears an interest of 115 points above LIBOR and has to be paid back after four years.</p>
<p>A total of 23 banks were members of the consortium.</p>
<p>Mandoki, asked about MOL's nine-month figures, said it was too early.</p>
<p>&quot;It's only beginning of October, so we aren't in the position to see the first-to-third quarter figures,&quot; Mandoki said. &quot;Those positive changes, which began at the company, begin to bear fruit.&quot;</p>
<p>According to rules of the Budapest Stock Exchange (BSE) companies in the listed A (previously called listed) category of the bourse have to submit their January-September results to the bourse by November 15.</p>
<p>On the BSE MOL shares closed at 1,605 forints, down 15.</p>
