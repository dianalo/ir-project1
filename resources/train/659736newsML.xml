<p>Sunrise Resources Inc said Friday it expects to report fiscal 1997 revenues of $43 million, but a loss of about $200,000 or $0.03 a share versus a profit of $2.5 million or $0.35 a share the previous year.</p>
<p>The company said the loss is the result of taking additional reserves of $6.6 million, including the partial writedown of its investment in lease and loan financing. Sunrise said it reassessed certain leases and loans and determined the added reserves were necessary.  </p>
<p>Sunrise said the additional reserves were were recorded in the fourth quarter ended March 31. It said they also include an increase in the provision for potential losses on certain loans and reductions on certain lease residuals.</p>
<p>The additional reserves will result in non-compliance with the company's primary bank credit line, in turn triggering cross default provisions on other loans, Sunrise said.</p>
<p>&quot;Based on our discussions with our lenders, we believe that steps currently being taken by the company will result in the waiver by these lenders of the non-compliance with the covenants,&quot; Errol Carlstrom, president and chief executive, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Carlstrom the additional reserves will not affect the company's cash flows at present, but added, &quot;There is no assurance that such cash flows will not be affected in the future if certain lease and loan payments cease or are materially reduced&quot;.  </p>
<p>Sunrise said it will release final results for the year ended March 31 before July 1.</p>
<p>Despite the problems with historical lease and loan defaults, Sunrise said it strengthened its leasing business.</p>
<p>&quot;While Sunrise will continue in the short term to deal with several problem loan and lease issues, we are now able to see a time when all of the company's resources can be focused on current business,&quot; Carlstrom said.</p>
<p>Sunrise provides leasing options to third parties, manufacturers and distributors.</p>
