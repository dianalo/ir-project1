<p>State industrial enterprises in south China's Guangdong province notched up a combined net profit of 14 billion yuan for 1996, down 16 percent from 1995, local media reported on Monday.</p>
<p>Losses of 18 billion yuan in 1996 by the province's state-owned firms were offset by higher gross profits, the Shenzhen-based Investment Herald weekly said. It did not give a size for the gross profits.</p>
<p>The newspaper said loss makers were mostly firms set up in the 1960s with backward facilities and which suffered in the 1990s from cut-throat competition caused by so-called blind investments that were made without consideration of risk.</p>
<p>The newspaper attributed the earnings decline to increased tax payments, and finance-related and welfare costs.</p>
<p>The province's state industrial firms paid 27.37 billion yuan in tax in 1995, up 90 percent from 1990, it said.</p>
<p>Tax rates generally rose after China reformed its taxation system in 1994, it said.</p>
<p>Heavy bank interest payments also cut deep into the profits of state firms, it said.  </p>
<p>An official survey covering the province's 70 big industrial groups showed bank interest payments from those firms rose 16.4 percent year-on-year to 26.16 billion yuan in 1996, it said.</p>
<p>Their liabilities-to-assets ratio averaged 63 percent, with 28 of them exceeding 70 percent and several topping 90 percent, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Most debts were loans from state banks, with non-performing loans remaining at a high level, the newspaper added.</p>
<p>Welfare payments granted by state firms to employees surged 22.7 percent year-on-year in 1996 as a result of Beijing's policy of improving its social security system.</p>
