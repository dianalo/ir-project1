<p>The Pakistan stock market, though deperate for a good news, is likely to respond cautiously to what analysts termed a bold economic reform course laid out by the new finance chief of the interim government.</p>
<p>Shahid Javed Burki, the new adviser to caretaker Prime Minister Meraj Khalid and a World Bank vice president, in his first news conference set out a sweeping reform programme on Saturday to shore up the country's crumbling economic foundations and regain the favour of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;The proposed changes are a combination of classic IMF and World Bank prescriptions as would be expected from Burki who is a serving vice-president at the World Bank,&quot; Abid Naqvi, head of research at Taurus Securities said.</p>
<p>Burki took a 90-day leave of absence from the World Bank after President Farooq Leghari, who sacked Benazir Bhutto's government on Tuesday, asked him to join the interim government.</p>
<p>Naqvi said the market, despite agreeing with the basic thrust of the programme, was cautious as key questions remain unanswered.</p>
<p>The Karachi Stock Exchange's 100-share index fell through the psychological barrier of 1,500 points on Sunday and fell 24.68 points, or 1.63 percent, to close at 1,492.19.</p>
<p>Naqvi said the market was not sure whether the interim government has enough time to generate sufficient momentum to implement the package through the existing inefficient bureaucratic machinery.</p>
<p>&quot;Given its 90 day mandate, how will the interim government ensure continuity thereafter,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Analysts say in many ways Burki's programme is reminiscent of that of Pakistan's last caretaker government in 1993 under Moeen Qureshi, whose reforms led to a short-lived agreement with the IMF.</p>
<p>&quot;The previous such attempt under another World Bank official (Qureshi) failed on both counts,&quot; Naqvi said, noting the IMF agreement came to an abrupt end within 20 months.</p>
<p>Burki said on Saturday he would lay the groundwork for a cheaper, longer-term loan, or enhanced structural adjustment facility (ESAF), in the next few days.</p>
<p>Asked if his plans might unravel when a new political government is elected on February 3 -- just as Qureshi's did under the Bhutto government -- Burki said one important difference was that Leghari's term still has two years to run.</p>
<p>Analysts said, however, since the president will have to stand for re-election by a new parliament his ability to ensure continuity of the economic policies will be constrained.</p>
<p>Nadeem Naqvi, analyst at the International Asset Management Co Ltd, said foreign investors are also likely to wait and see how the political and the macro-economic situation changes.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are sceptical about how the new set up will improve economic indicators within three months, given the political scenario which is fluid at the moment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Nadeem Naqvi said foreign investors perceived that at least two quarters were needed to trigger an improvement in the economic indicators.</p>
<p>He said the market was likely to remain volatile as more news about the reform programme filtered through and predicted foreign investment inflows in the May-June 1997 quarter if the reforms remained on track.</p>
<p>&quot;The only good thing is that maybe Pakistan has the last of its negative surprises when Moody's downgraded its rating,&quot; he said.</p>
