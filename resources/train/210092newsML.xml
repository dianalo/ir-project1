<p>Western and African military leaders met to discuss sending troops to ease Zaire's refugee crisis on Friday, but failed even to agree on the number of refugees and said their talks would go on into the weekend.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Maurice Baril of Canada, which is coordinating the U.N.-authorised mission, told a news conference that estimates presented at the meeting of the number of refugees in need of help varied between 100,000 and 500,000.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to find out (how many there are) before we commit any troops,&quot; he said. &quot;By the end of the weekend I would hope we will have developed a full slate of options.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A firm commitment (to send troops) can only be made later by governments after they have considered all the options,&quot; he told a news conference near the venue of the meeting at U.S. European Command headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany.</p>
<p>Baril refuse to be drawn on how many troops, if any, such a mission might require, but he said there appeared to be between 100,000 and 250,000 refugees requiring help.</p>
<p>But he did narrow the scope of a potential mission, saying: &quot;The mandate we have is to open a (relief) corridor to those who really need it...We're not here to feed and transport them, but to open the corridor.&quot;</p>
<p>A major problem for nations wanting to help has been the fluidity of the situation in eastern Zaire, where hundreds of thousands of Rwandan Hutu refugees have been displaced by a conflict pitting Rwandan-backed Zairean Tutsi rebels against Zairean government forces and Rwandan Hutu militias.</p>
<p>Baril said the first task for the Stuttgart planning meeting would be to get together with relief and multinational organisations to try to get a better idea of the size of the problem.</p>
<p>U.S. Brigadier General John Casey said part of the problem was finding out how many of the displaced people who had been located in aerial reconnaissance were Rwandan Hutu refugees rather than extremist Rwandan militias or Zaireans displaced within their own country.</p>
<p>Britain, France and Spain have all said they believe a force is still required despite the return of half a million refugees to Rwanda in the last week.</p>
<p>Zaire also maintains that a multinational force is still needed to help refugees and displaced Zaireans. It also wants such a force to help it recover territory from rebels.</p>
<p>But Washington, stung by the failure of its Somali military mission in the early 1990s, has cancelled plans to send combat troops to the region and instead has begun preparing for an airlift in which the U.S. military would provide logistics.</p>
<p>Several African nations -- including Zimbabwe, Botswana, Cameroon, Senegal and South Africa -- were present at the talks as well as representatives from the major Western powers.</p>
<p>But there were no representatives present from either Zaire or Rwanda.</p>
