<p>U.S. sour crudes retained their strength in late cash trading on Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>One Gulf Coast buyer attributed part of the firmness on Mexican and Venezuelan moves to store sour crude in the Caribbean, but this could not be immediately confirmed.</p>
<p>The continued closure of Mexico's Pajaritos port could be another factor, traders said.</p>

<p>West Texas Sour/Midland was around $2.00-1.95 a barrel under WTI/Cushing, with $2.00 last changing hands, up 10-15 cents from Tuesday.</p>
<p>Eugene Island was talked at WTI/Cushing minus $1.95-85 barrel after moving at minus $2.00 earlier.</p>
<p>Sweet grades were steady to weaker as the market digested a wave of West African crude on the Gulf Coast.</p>
