<p>Hyundai Electronics, a unit of South Korea's sprawling Hyundai Group, said Tuesday it planned a $1.4 billion semiconductor plant in Scotland to tap European markets with a new generation of computer memory chips.</p>
<p>&quot;The main purpose of the project is securing a production base in Europe in order to expand our market share in the region and overcome trade barriers,&quot; a Hyundai spokesman said.</p>
<p>The plant will begin commercial production of dynamic random access memory chips in December 1998 and generate about 1,000 jobs, he said.</p>
<p>Hyundai's plan comes on the heels of LG Group's 1.7 billion British pound ($1 billion) deal in July to make semiconducters and electronic goods in Wales -- the biggest single overseas investment in Europe from outside the European region.</p>
<p>&quot;Main items will be 64- and 256-megabit DRAMS, whose demand in Europe is expected to rise sharply from late next year on,&quot; the spokesman said. The 64-megabit and faster 256-megabit chips are considered a new generation in semiconductor products.</p>
<p>Prices for widely used 16-megabit DRAM chips have slumped following a huge glut of supply, weighing heavily on South Korean electronics firms and forcing them to look further abroad for new investment opportunities, analysts said.</p>
<p>The move to produce faster memory chips is particularly important for the South Korean economy, whose exports have been hit hard by spiralling prices for the 16-megabit chips.</p>
<p>The Scotland plant would be Hyundai Electronics' first European investment. The group began construction in February on a $1.3 billion semiconductor plant in the United States that is due to be completed late next year.</p>
<p>Hyundai said it selected Dunfermline, about 15 miles north of Edinburgh, because of various favourable conditions which Britain offered.</p>
