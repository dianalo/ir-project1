<p>Terrell Brandon scored 23 points and Michael Jordan missed a three-point attempt with one second remaining as the Cleveland Cavaliers posted a 73-70 victory over the Bulls on Thursday, snapping Chicago's seven-game winning streak.</p>
<p>Two free throws by Brandon and a jumper by Vitaly Potapenko with 2:45 remaining gave Cleveland a 72-65 lead. Potapenko hit all four of his field goals in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Chicago responded with a three-pointer by Steve Kerr and Scottie Pippen's two free throws with 19.7 seconds left, narrowing the deficit to 72-70.</p>
<p>Chris Mills was fouled with 10 seconds remaining and hit one of two free throws for the three-point margin. The Bulls then got the ball to Jordan, who could not sink a long-range shot that would have sent the game into overtime.</p>
<p>Jordan finished with 23 points and Dennis Rodman contributed 16 points and 16 rebounds for Chicago.</p>
<p>&quot;It was amazing that we had an opportunity to be in the ballgame,&quot; Jordan said. &quot;We never shot well and every loose ball, they came up with. It certainly was not the Bulls' night.&quot;</p>
<p>Chicago was held to its lowest point total since an 88-68 loss at Sacramento two years ago. The Bulls had won the last six meetings with Cleveland, including two games this season.</p>
<p>&quot;It was a great win for our team,&quot; said Cavaliers Coach Mike Fratello. &quot;We caught a lot of breaks, but I think we worked hard and made a lot of our breaks happen.&quot;</p>
<p>At Utah, Karl Malone recorded his second career triple-double with 32 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists to lead the Jazz to a 118-114 victory over the Toronto Raptors.</p>
<p>John Stockton added 19 points and 13 assists for the Jazz, who have won nine of 10 games to build a four-game lead over second-place Houston in the Midwest Division.</p>
<p>Walt Williams scored 32 points to lead Toronto.</p>
<p>In Dallas, Tom Gugliotta sank a 15-foot jumper from the left wing with 2.6 seconds left in double overtime to lift the Minnesota Timberwolves to a 107-105 win over the Mavericks.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves tied a single-season franchise record for wins with their 29th victory and moved two games over .500 for the first time in team history.</p>
<p>Kevin Garnett scored 23 points and Gugliotta added 22 points for Minnesota.</p>
<p>Erick Strickland led Dallas with 25 points.</p>
<p>At Washington, Elden Campbell scored 38 points and Nick Van Exel added 31 points and 12 assists as the Los Angeles Lakers defeated the Bullets 122-107.</p>
<p>Byron Scott scored five straight points early in the fourth quarter to help Los Angeles pull away.</p>
<p>Campbell is starting at centre in place of the injured Shaquille O'Neal.</p>
<p>Juwan Howard led the Bullets with 26 points and 12 rebounds, while Chris Webber added 24 points.</p>
<p>In Houston, Glen Rice scored 24 points, including seven during a key third-quarter run, as the Charlotte Hornets rallied for a 106-95 win over the Rockets.</p>
<p>Dell Curry added 17 points and Ricky Pierce had 13 for Charlotte, which won for the first time in 10 tries in Houston with strong help off the bench. Charlotte's reserves out-scored the Houston bench, 56-15.</p>
<p>Hornets forward Anthony Mason was ejected in the second quarter after arguing a foul and Charlotte Coach Dave Cowens also was ejected.</p>
<p>Mario Elie scored 23 points and Hakeem Olajuwon added 22 for Houston.</p>
