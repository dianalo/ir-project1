<p>Further consolidation is expected for Belgian shares after Wednesday's profit-taking, but dealers see no big downturn.</p>
<p>&quot;New York is down again in early trade today. If it stays there, we should be slightly negative tomorrow,&quot; said a trader. &quot;People need a breather and there will be further consolidation, but no dramatic downturn.&quot;</p>
<p>In line with weaker neighbouring bourses, the Bel-20 index of leading shares  .BFX closed on Wednesday 13.40 points or 0.73 percent down at the day's low of 1,810.15 points. A moderate 1.9 billion Belgian francs worth of shares changed hands.</p>
<p>&quot;We've been more resistant than other European markets lately and today's regression was gentler than elsewhere,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;The market's well supported at these levels, though there's not a lot of volume.&quot;</p>
<p>Retailer Delhaize was among the biggest losers, shedding 2.7 percent to 1,815 francs on a softer U.S. dollar. Chemicals group Solvay and oil stock Petrofina were also hit, slipping 1.3 and 0.6 percent respectively.</p>
<p>Belgium's biggest bank Generale Bank bucked the trend, gaining 0.7 percent at 10,875 francs, and posted the biggest volume by value, as it bounced back from recent lows.</p>
<p>D'Ieteren surged 3.8 percent to end at 5,710 francs after hitting a record high of 5,950 francs. The car importer and distributor, which is not continuously quoted on the Brussels bourse, was the seventh biggest traded stock by volume, a feat described by traders as &quot;impressive&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent media reports confirmed the company's good earnings trend and business is good at its car hire subsidiary,&quot; said a trader. D'Ieteren imports Volkswagen, Audi, Seat, Skoda and Porsche cars, and owns a majority stake in car hire firm, Avis Europe.</p>
