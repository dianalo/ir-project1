<p>Hundreds of people chanting anti-government slogans gathered on Friday in the eastern Lebanese town of Baalbek to launch a &quot;hunger revolt&quot; against the government.</p>
<p>Troops with armoured vehicles ringed the Bekaa Valley town known for its spectacular ancient ruins as Sheikh Soubhi Tufaili, a radical Shi'ite Moslem cleric and former head of the pro-Iranian Hizbollah movement, arrived to launch a campaign intended to force the government to tackle poverty in the region.</p>
<p>Tufaili, who led Hizbollah (Party of God) in the 1980s, is urging Bekaa residents to start a civil disobedience campaign by refusing to pay taxes and is demanding that the government reduce utilities, hospital and education charges for Bekaa residents.</p>
<p>Several hundred people in the main square of the town roared their support as the fiery cleric arrived for the rally wearing a black cloak and a white turban.</p>
<p>&quot;With our souls and blood we serve you, Tufaili,&quot; they shouted.</p>
<p>Tufaili and his supporters say Bekaa Valley residents have become impoverished since Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war due to a government crackdown on illegal drugs crops.</p>
<p>They accuse the authorities of ignoring their plight and failing to support new crops to maintain living standards.</p>
<p>&quot;People can't eat lunch and can't eat dinner. People are hungry. We will back the revolution and the sheikh (Tufaili) until we die,&quot; shouted a Bekaa farmer, addressing the crowd from a platform in front of Baalbek's serail (government house).</p>
<p>The serail was draped with a huge black cloth carrying the slogan in white letters: &quot;This is the grave of the criminal Lebanese authorities. God damn their soul.&quot;</p>
<p>Armed police stood on the roof of the building and Lebanese army troops manned roadblocks ringing the town as busloads of Tufaili supporters drove in from other areas.</p>
<p>Only a handful of police armed with automatic rifles could be seen in the town itself. Streets leading to the main square were manned by young Tufaili militants with black bands round their foreheads. Some brandished black flags and sickles.</p>
<p>President Elias Hrawi threatened last month to prosecute Tufaili when he first announced his campaign.</p>
<p>However, the government later allotted emergency funding of 150 billion Lebanese pounds ($97 million) for Bekaa development and Interior Minister Michel al-Murr said the inaugural rally could go ahead so long as national security was not endangered.</p>
<p>Tufaili has said he would take his campaign further by launching a hunger march on Beirut to besiege the residences of Hrawi, billionaire Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri and parliament speaker Nabih Berri if the government did not act effectively to alleviate poverty in the Bekaa.</p>
<p>Several people on the speakers' platform shouted &quot;Death to Hariri&quot; after Tufaili arrived in the main square of Baalbek to address the crowd.</p>
<p>Baalbek has been a stronghold of Hizbollah since its formation in the early 1980s with the help of Iranian revolutionary guards. Many Western hostages kidnapped by shadowy Moslem groups were believed to be held there during the war.</p>
<p>However, Tufaili's campaign is a challenge to the movement's leadership in Hizbollah's heartland.</p>
<p>He says the current Hizbollah leaders are too soft. They have replied that although it is true that poverty is rife in the Bekaa Valley, Tufaili's fiery tactics are not the way to tackle the problem.</p>
