<p>Two schoolgirls were killed and at least four people were wounded when a Jordanian solider fired on an Israeli school bus at the Israeli-Jordanian border on Thursday, rescuers said.</p>
<p>Israeli radio stations said the soldier shot at a bus along the border in a farm area which Israel leases from Jordan under a 1994 peace deal. Other Jordanian soldiers overpowered the gunman.</p>
<p>Israelis and Palestinians had feared an outbreak of violence following Israel's decision to forge ahead with a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>A hospital in the area was preparing for as many as 20 or more wounded. Several teenage schoolgirls arrived by ambulance. Some wounded were reported taken to hospital in Jordan.</p>
<p>&quot;According to information that is in our hands, there are two dead...Details are unclear for now,&quot; Israel radio said.</p>
<p>A witness told Army radio: &quot;We arrived at the area swiftly. A group of schoolgirls who were on the 'Island of Peace'...They tried to get away from there because he didn't let them clear the wounded.&quot;</p>
<p>Another witness said: &quot;There is a huge great panic. Many, many security forces have arrived.&quot; Helicopters hovered overhead.</p>
<p>&quot;By all appearances we are talking about a bus, a bus of children, which was fired upon by a Jordanian soldier from the border at the Naharayim junction,&quot; the witness told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Jordan and Israel signed a treaty in October 1994 and their border has been quiet for years.</p>
