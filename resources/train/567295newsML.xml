<p>UK telecoms watchdog Oftel said on Wednesday that it would look closely at how a new venture involving British Telecom and BSkyB intends to operate.</p>
<p>But Oftel director-general Don Cruickshank said it was not his job to approve the joint venture.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was not my job to approve this joint venture - that is for others including the European Commission. Now the joint venture has been announced, my job is to look at the way they do business,&quot; Cruickshank said.</p>
<p>&quot;If the joint venture works in a way which doesn't distort the market, the range of services it offers will be good news for customers,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Cruickshank said that Oftel would monitor developments in a bid to ensure compatibility between digital satellite, digital cable and digital terrestrial delivery platforms.</p>
<p>&quot;Over the coming months I will be watching very closely how this compatibility pledge develops and also at a number of other key issues.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;For example, how to recover the cost of subsidising the set-top box down to around 200 pounds, and how conditional access and the electronic programme guide will apply to all broadcasters and providers of interactive services.&quot; BT and BSkyB plan each to take a 32.5 percent stake in BIB, while Midland Bank will have 20 percent and Matsushita 15 percent.</p>
<p>BIB plans to develop interactive services such as home shopping and home banking and subsidise set-top boxes down to a retail price of around 200 stg.</p>
