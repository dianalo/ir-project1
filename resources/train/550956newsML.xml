<p>Ag Services of America Inc said Wednesday it is on track to meet its goal of growing earnings and revenues by 20 to 25 percent in its 1998 fiscal year.</p>
<p>&quot;If current favorable weather conditions continue, the company believes it will have its tenth consecutive year of record net revenues and earnings,&quot; Ag Services said in a statement. &quot;It is currently on target to meet its stated 20 percent to 25 percent revenues and earnings growth objectives for fiscal 1998.&quot;  </p>
<p>Ag Services, which supplies seed, fertilizer, crop insurance and cash advances to farmers, said at present it has three customers that have been partially affected by the flooding of the Red River in North Dakota, and all expect to complete planting.</p>
<p>&quot;Therefore, the company believes the recent flooding in North Dakota will have little or no impact on the company's growth and profitability for fiscal 1998,&quot; Ag Services said.</p>
<p>To date, Ag Services said customer applications and approvals for the planting season are well ahead of last year. The company has completed about 95 percent of its sales and marketing season, it said.</p>
<p>Ag Services said some portions of its marketing regions have had a cold and wet spring which could mean possible delays in planting, but favorable conditions the last several days in most areas have improved soil preparation and planting progress.</p>
