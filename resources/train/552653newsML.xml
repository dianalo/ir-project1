<p>At least 5,000 Palestinians previously barred from working in Israel entered from Gaza on Wednesday after Israel eased restrictions, a Palestinian official said.</p>
<p>Israel said on Tuesday it would let 55,000 Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza enter Israel beginning on Wednesday, easing a closure imposed after an Islamist bombing of a Tel Aviv cafe last month.</p>
<p>&quot;The number of workers who actually crossed Erez Crossing (from Gaza to Israel) today is 15,000,&quot; said Brigadier General Saeb al-Ajez, responsible for self-ruled Gaza's borders for the Palestinian Authority. &quot;Yesterday the number was 10,000 so we have at least a new 5,000.&quot;</p>
<p>Figures on labourers crossing from the West Bank were not immediately available.</p>
<p>Said al-Mudallal, head of the Department of Employment at the Palestinian Ministry of Labour, said 19,000 Palestinians from Gaza had permits to work in Israel, including 5,500 with permits issued on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said in the West Bank 14,000 Palestinians had work permits. He said Israel told the Palestinians it would increase the number of permits to 27,000 in Gaza and 28,000 in the West Bank, but the process would take a few days.</p>
<p>Israel Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said he hoped &quot;we will reach a situation where all aspects of (Palestinian) life will become fairly reasonable.&quot;</p>
<p>Mudallal said: &quot;Any additional number of workers means minimising unemployment in Gaza and the West Bank and is a positive step.&quot;</p>
<p>Under the new regulations permits are issued only to married Palestinians over the age of 30. Israel believes marriage and age requirements cut the risk of suicide bombers entering.</p>
<p>However, a Palestinian bomber who killed three Israeli women at a Tel Aviv cafe on March 21 was married and the father of four children.</p>
<p>The attack came three days after Israel began construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem which Palestinians view as the capital of their future state. The building touched off West Bank clashes in which Israeli troops killed seven Palestinians.</p>
<p>Palestinian legislator Fadel Tahboub said easing the closure was not enough to solve the problems of the Palestinian economy.</p>
<p>&quot;They treat us like we're in a big jail,&quot; he told Israel Radio. &quot;Everyone needs a permit. Whoever doesn't have a permit can be caught even on their way back and fined or jailed. The closure damages our economy and hurts our people.&quot;</p>
<p>Israeli police said on Wednesday a Palestinian was killed at an Israeli West Bank roadblock when police fired at the car he was travelling in and it collided with a truck.</p>
<p>A police spokeswoman said police signalled the car to stop and opened fire when the order was ignored. The dead man's identity was not immediately known, police said.</p>
