<p>- The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia again offers to establish diplomatic relations with Bosnia. The offer was sent to Moslem chairman of the collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, and is now being analysed.</p>
<p>- The main obstacle for establishment of diplomatic ties between Bosnia and Yugoslavia is Belgrade's request for Bosnia to withdraw suit in international court charging millitary agression by Yugoslavia. So far, Sarajevo has refused.</p>
<p>- Manfred Novak, former U.N. envoy for missing persons, says he resigned because he did not get financial support from the international community for his job in Bosnia.</p>
