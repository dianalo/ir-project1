<title>UK: LIFFE coffee at day's high, July/Sept widens.</title>
<headline>LIFFE coffee at day's high, July/Sept widens.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>LIFFE robusta coffee futures finished up and at the day's high on Wednesday supported by roaster buying but dealings were thin throughout.</p>
<p>Traders said activity was restricted as players turned cautious ahead of the long weekend in the United States. The New York arabica futures market is closed on Friday for the Independence Day holiday.</p>
<p>Volume totalled just 2,739 lots. Activity focussed on light industry buying, switches and some book-squaring.</p>
<p>September bucked lower opening calls to open about unchanged and ended the day $19 up at $1,840, the session high. November also firmed $19 at $1,825.</p>
<p>July/Sept switches, which were traded at $28 in the morning, widened to finish $36. Sept/Nov continued to range at $13-$14.</p>
<p>Fears of cold weather in Brazil's coffee belt that helped fuel the New York rally on Tuesday seemed to have subsided.</p>
<p>But attention is now focussed on Monday's volcanic eruption in Mexico which could force thousands of villagers to be evacuated.</p>
<p>The 17,890-foot (5,452-metre) giant Popocatepeti volcano, in its biggest eruption in 72 years, spewed red-hot rocks and a thick cloud ash that spread for hundreds of miles across central Mexico.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known if coffee farms were affected. Mexico is a key Central American producer.</p>
<p>Both U.S. and Brazilian weathermen said on Wednesday warm weather was in store for Brazil's coffee region this weekend.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, traders said the 574 lots of originals put up for tender on the first notice day on Tuesday was at the low end of market expectation.</p>
<p>In other news, the Ivorian coffee crop could fall in 1997/98 (Oct/Sept) from 1996/97's 300,000 tonnes, the largest crop since 1980/81, analysts said.</p>
