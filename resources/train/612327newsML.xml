<p>Hong Kong's leader-designate Tung Chee-hwa sought on Saturday to calm jitters in the territory by rejecting claims that the proposed electoral systems for a future legislature would keep democrats out of power.</p>
<p>The colony also received a big vote of confidence on Saturday from Thailand when its visiting Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasan announced visa-free access for holders of passports that Hong Kong will issue after its reversion to China.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the provisional legislature endorsed the nomination of British-educated lawyer Andrew Li as the Chief Justice of the future Court of Final Appeal, marking another milestone in the formation of the post-handover judiciary system.</p>
<p>Britain hands Hong Kong back to China on July 1, ending more than 150 years of colonial rule.</p>
<p>Tung returned on Saturday from Beijing where the China-appointed Preparatory Committee, which has been designing the framework of the future government, gave him recommendations on how to fill the seats of a new legislature to be elected in 1998.</p>
<p>He rejected suggestions that the proposed electoral system was stacked against democrats.</p>
<p>&quot;I think they have every opportunity to participate and I hope they will,&quot; he told reporters at the airport.</p>
<p>China has already made clear it will scrap the territory's existing fully-elected legislature and replace it with an appointed provisional legislature before a new legislature is elected.</p>
<p>The Preparatory Committee recommended the 20 directly-elected seats of the 60-strong new legislature be filled either by a form of proportional representation or a multi-candidate race with several top vote-getters winning office.</p>
<p>&quot;Each one of these systems is practised by different countries of the world and each one is democratic. The question is which is more suited for Hong Kong, and these are the things we will be looking at very carefully,&quot; Tung said.</p>
<p>Political analysts say the various systems of multi-seat, single-vote or proportional representation will limit the chances of the the most popular camp, the Democratic Party, and help some unpopular parties get more seats.</p>
