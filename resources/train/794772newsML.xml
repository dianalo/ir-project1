<p>German television broadcasters on Tuesday hosted TV stars and famous boxers and premiered new programmes at the industry's first trade fair aimed at boosting sales of advertising space as market growth slows.</p>
<p>Around 3,000 marketing, product and advertising managers are expected to attend the two-day fair that hosts nearly two dozen television stations and will give a peek at autumn shows and celebrities such as German boxer Henry Maske.</p>
<p>The fair is sponsored by the channel Sat1, and Germany's two main media agencies -- IP Deutschland, which is linked to the RTL group, and MediaGruppe Munich (MGM), with ties to recently-listed Pro Sieben Media AG.</p>
<p>Under pressure from media managers who had grown tired of each year's endless caravan of TV road shows, Germany's major stations banded together in a rare show of solidarity to give their customers the chance to compare stations directly.</p>
<p>&quot;In the past we had to drive around the country with 80 people for two weeks,&quot; said Jean-Pierre Wilwerding, head of IP Deutschland, that sells advertising space for RTL, RTL2, Super RTL and the German subsidiary of Viacom's Nickelodeon.</p>
<p>&quot;But today for the first time we are all in one place,&quot; he added. Public broadcasters ARD and ZDF did not attend the fair.</p>
<p>German net TV advertising revenues were around seven billion marks last year, but growth has slowed to around eight percent, a far cry from over 40 percent growth in the 1980s.</p>
<p>With some 30 channels that finance their programming through advertising, Germany is the world's second-largest TV market and viewers have the choice of hundreds of movies each week. But the sheer volume of programming is creating problems.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is out of balance,&quot; said Andreas Kuehner, spokesman for IP Deutschland. &quot;There are a lot of channels and meanwhile an oversupply of advertising time. A buyer's market has evolved from a seller's market.&quot;</p>
<p>In the huge halls of the Frankfurt convention centre amid the din of video clips, TV stations presented glitzy shows and provided potential customers with an atmosphere that aimed to set them apart from the competition next door.</p>
<p>RTL and SAT1, Germany's two largest commercial stations, pulled out the big guns. RTL presented boxing star Henry Maske, while Germany's wannabe David Letterman, the popular talk show host Harald Schmidt, came out for his employer SAT1.</p>
<p>Small niche channels also had their day.</p>
<p>TM3, the Munich-based women's channel, invited potential customers into a warm, rustic setting surrounded by plants and hanging vines to discuss ad rates for the coming season.</p>
<p>All-news channel N-TV, however, which shared a booth with the Weather Channel beneath a transparent globe with water fountains, said the event was dominated by big stations and niche players would have a hard time.</p>
<p>&quot;The opportunities and the show that buyers are getting here is fascinating,&quot; said N-TV chief Karl-Ulrich Kuhlo. &quot;But it is still questionable on the first day of the fair whether we, as a niche station, can keep up.&quot;</p>
<p>The buyers clearly enjoyed not only the spectacle but also the first chance to judge stations as if at a beauty contest.</p>
<p>&quot;It is wonderful that as planners we have all the stations here side by side and can make direct comparisons,&quot; said a manager whose agency buys ad time for Mitsubishi.</p>
<p>A buyer for the car industry, who also asked to remain anonymous, said the fair made buying advertising time more efficient.</p>
<p>&quot;But most of all I like the screening inn the big congress halls; it's like being at the movies,&quot; he said.</p>
