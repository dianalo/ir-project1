<p>One person was killed and more than 30 injured Wednesday in a fire at a hospital north of Toronto, fire officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have one confirmed fatality, one person severely burned and six people with smoke inhalation. But the ambulance staff say they are treating over 30 others. I don't know the severity (of their injuries) though,&quot; North York Fire Chief Frank Lamie said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>He said more than 100 patients were evacuated from the hospital after the fire was discovered at about 7 a.m. EDT in the chronic-care wing of Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in North York, a suburb of Toronto. The wing houses mostly war veterans.</p>
<p>The fire was extinguished after about 10 minutes, Lamie said. The cause of the fire was being investigated.</p>
