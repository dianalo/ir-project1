<p>Polish stocks fell for the third day running on Wednesday and analysts said that though shares could begin to stabilise on Thursday, May earnings reports, most due later on Wednesday, provided some uncertainty.</p>
<p>&quot;We could have still have more stocks falling as in recent sessions but some firms could do well with earnings and demand might concentrate on the good firms, giving us a swing of plus- minus 0.5 percent,&quot; said Tomasz Cwintal of BGZ brokerage.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market could receive a lift from Wednesday's news that the privatisation offer of Bank Handlowy was heavily oversubsubscribed.</p>
<p>The retail tranche of Poland's largest commercial bank was three times subscribed and the institutional tranche 17.4 times subscribed with foreign demand exceeding $3.5 billion.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index fell 1.3 percent ot 15,902.2 points and turnover rose 3.7 percent to 117 million zlotys ($36.1 million) on all three markets. Losers led gainers by 64 to 21 with 21 stocks.</p>
<p>Analysts said the good macroeconomic environment was another good sign but that the upcoming large public offering of copper giant KGHM Polska Miedz and uncertainty on this September's parliamentary elections would dampen buying.</p>
<p>Tyre maker Stomil Olsztyn fell 9.5 percent in light trade the day after it announced it was recalling two defective types of passenger car tyres and one type of delivery van tyre and would make 13.6 milliion zlotys ($4.2 million) in provisions in June. Stomil is 52.1-percent owned by France's Michelin.</p>
