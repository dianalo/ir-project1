<p>Carmike Cinemas said Tuesday that it believes the upcoming mid-summer movie releases will help boost results past what the company called a disappointing second quarter.</p>
<p>Although the company said in a statement that its second quarter earnings were a record for the company, they were still not as good as they had hoped.</p>
<p>Commenting on the quarter, Michael Patrick, president and chief executive officer of Carmike said, &quot;We are disappointed with the quarter's results even though it was a record quarter for the company.  Although April was very strong for us, beginning May 9th the available product did not perform up to expectations and did not hold well, nor was it able to surpass the strong results of &quot;Twister&quot; in the same period in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Patrick continued, &quot;Upcoming movies this summer are &quot;Air Force One,&quot; &quot;Conspiracy Theory&quot; and &quot;Spawn&quot; which should assist us with the third quarter results versus last year's when we were up against the Olympics.&quot;</p>
<p>Carmike reported second quarter earnings of $0.52 a share compared to $0.43 during the same time last year.</p>
