<p>British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind heatedly warned on Monday that Iraq's push into Kurdish areas was a pretext to regain territory lost in the Gulf War and was a launching point for new attacks on Baghdad's neighbours.</p>
<p>In a hard-hitting dismissal of suggestions that Iraq was acting on behalf of Kurdish factions in its troop and tank advance, Rifkind said the United States, Britain and its allies would address the provocation &quot;sooner rather than later&quot;.</p>
<p>Rifkind also cautioned against accepting that just because Iraqi forces appeared to be withdrawing from the town of Abril, site of the inter-Kurd fighting, Baghdad was giving up control of the area.</p>
<p>&quot;It all depends if they are withdrawing five kilometres (three miles) or 50 miles (80 kms),&quot; Rifkind told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;They can still control the town even if they are not inside its city limits,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Iraqi troops supporting the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) captured Arbil from rival forces of the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) on Saturday and hoisted the Iraqi flag over what used to be the Kurdish parliament.</p>
<p>Fighting between the two Kurdish factions -- longtime rivals which have shifted alliances between Iraq and Iran -- flared in mid-August despite U.S. efforts to broker a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Arbil was not in a zone placed off-limits to Iraqi troops by the United Nations after the Gulf War to protect the Kurdish minority. But U.S. officials said it lies within a &quot;no-fly zone&quot; and that U.N. resolutions broadly protecting the Kurds apply.</p>
<p>U.N. relief officials and guards in Baghdad said on Monday that Iraqi troops along with their heavy armour and artillery had evacuated Arbil but opponents of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein reported executions in the streets.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't think the world should be fooled by the pretext given by Saddam Hussein,&quot; Rifkind said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not because of Kurdish rivalry that he has sent tanks to the area. His objective is to re-establish his control over all of the Kurdish area and to try to regain control of northern Iraq,&quot; Rifkind added.</p>
<p>&quot;If he regained control of all of Iraq he could contemplate a renewal of aggression.&quot;</p>
<p>Rifkind said Iraq's actions were &quot;extremely disturbing&quot; and must not be allowed to stand.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clearly a grave violation of the safety area, the safe zone and I believe there can be no justification for action of this kind,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Rifkind is in Japan for a three-day visit on a tour that has already taken him to Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka. On Wednesday he leaves Tokyo for his last stop in Mongolia.</p>
<p>As well as U.S., forces in the region, about 70 U.S., British and French aircraft have been based in southern Turkey to prevent Baghdad's forces from attacking Kurds in northern Iraq since Saddam Hussein tried to take control of the region shortly after the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>The force includes six British Tornado GR1 fighter-bombers equipped with laser-guided bombs, anti-armour cluster bombs and the JP233 runway-busting device. Britain also has two destroyers on patrol in the Gulf armed with Sea Dart missiles, torpedoes and Lynx helicopters.</p>
