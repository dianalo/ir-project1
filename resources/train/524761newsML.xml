<p>A move by anti-abortion forces to recall Wisconsin's two Democratic U.S. senators got a boost during the weekend when a Republican congressman threw his weight behind it.</p>
<p>Representative Mark Neumann, a likely Senate candidate himself next year, said at a state Lutherans for Life gathering that he already had signed petitions seeking to recall Sens. Herb Kohl and Russ Feingold before their terms expired. He urged other anti-abortion activists to do the same.</p>
<p>Kohl, one of the state's most popular politicians, was re-elected to a six-year term in 1994. Feingold, a freshmen with a recent public opinion approval rating of 55 percent, is up for re-election next year.</p>
<p>But the recall effort, based upon their votes on a ban on so-called partial birth abortions, could change that schedule. The well-financed, well-organised effort is led by a group calling itself First Breath Alliance, which has more than 5,000 petition-carriers and a budget approaching $100,000, according to recent news reports.</p>
<p>A Kohl spokesman said the senator supported restrictions on the late term abortion procedure but did not back a total ban that would include cases where the mother's health or life was seriously in danger.</p>
<p>Neumann, though he claims not to be involved in the recall effort, said Saturday that signing the petitions would send a message on the issue.</p>
<p>&quot;I would think they would understand a few hundred thousand recall petitions,&quot; he said, noting anti-abortion forces still are short of the 67 U.S. Senate votes needed to override a presidential veto on the issue if one occurs again.</p>
<p>First Breath Alliance launched its recall effort April 4. It has 60 days from that date to present nearly 391,000 (corrects) petition signatures each against Feingold and Kohl. If enough valid signatures are submitted, the Wisconsin Elections Board could call special recall elections for later in the year.</p>
<p>If such elections were to occur, the incumbents would run against opposing candidates. But such elections are far from a sure thing, election analysts say. Gathering enough valid signatures is a huge task and there is also the question of whether Wisconsin's recall law applies to federal officials, whose offices were created by the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Neither the Constitution nor federal law provides for the recall of members of Congress. First Breath Alliance admits that but says it will fight any challenges all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
