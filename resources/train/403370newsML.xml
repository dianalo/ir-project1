<p>Mild winter weather has helped to beef up U.S. distillate stocks to near normal levels, the Energy Information Administration said Wednesday.</p>
<p>U.S. distillate inventories, including heating oil and diesel, fell 500,000 barrels to 105.3 million barrels last week, but were up 3.4 million barrels from a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;The 105.3 million barrels reported this week is ... almost within normal bounds,&quot; EIA said in its weekly distillate watch.</p>
<p>&quot;Distillate demand has fallen to 3.2 million barrels per day, in reflection of the warmer temperatures that have prevailed across much of the East Coast,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>Heating oil production for the week ending February 21 dropped to 1.3 million barrels per day from levels as high as 1.6 million bpd earlier this winter.</p>
<p>Diesel fuel production rose to 1.8 million bpd last week from about 1.7 million bpd the previous week.</p>
<p>Refinery use held at a low 89.7 percent with crude inputs of 13.4 million bpd last week, about the same as the previous week, &quot;indicating that maintenance activity prior to the gasoline season is being completed early this year,&quot; EIA said.</p>
