<p>The Taiwan dollar closed at an 11-month low against its U.S. counterpart on Tuesday, as political jitters ahead of a planned cabinet reshuffle spurred a foreign funds outflow begun on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>The local unit closed at T$27.778 against Monday's T$27.759 finish. It was the rate's lowest close since it finished at T$27.790 on June 8, 1996.</p>
<p>Turnover through dealers was a hectic US$375.5 million.</p>
<p>The dollar had fallen sharply on Monday against the greenback, driven down by the withdrawal of millions of dollars in foreign equity from the plunging stock market.  </p>
<p>Share prices again fell on Tuesday, but by only 0.18 percent -- far less than Monday's huge 3.72 percent selloff.</p>
<p>Anti-government sentiment in Taiwan erupted in April following the kidnap and murder of a famous actress's teenage daughter, triggering widespread calls for a cabinet reshuffle and the resignation of Premier Lien Chan.</p>
<p>Lien, who said on Monday he would resign in July, was expected to propose a mild cabinet reshuffle on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Parliament narrowly defeated an opposition-sponsored motion that would have urged President Lee Teng-hui to sack Lien and order a sweeping cabinet reshuffle.  </p>
<p>&quot;The political concerns right now are causing the Taiwan dollar to depreciate,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is a depreciation which the government, and the central bank in particular, does not mind seeing,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Many dealers and analysts believe the government welcomes a modest depreciation of the Taiwan dollar, which would spur exports -- the island's economic lifeblood.</p>
<p>A T$27.76-80 range was seen for Wednesday.</p>
