<title>UK: IBCA rates Imperial Tobacco BBB plus l-term.</title>
<headline>IBCA rates Imperial Tobacco BBB plus l-term.</headline>

<p>IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said on Monday it had assigned Imperial Tobacco Group a long-term rating of BBB plus and a short-term rating of A2.  </p>
<p>IBCA said Imperial Tobacco Group (ITG) which demerged from Hanson on October 1 1996 is Britain's second largest tobacco company with a good brand portfolio.</p>
<p>&quot;The UK cigarette market is in slow decline because of health concerns and fiscal penalties, but there still are an estimated 14 million smokers and any sudden fall in sales or profits is extremely unlikely,&quot; IBCA said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;ITG has expanded its international operations to compensate for the shrinking UK market and an increasing volume of sales is now generated overseas.&quot;</p>
<p>The rating agency said the threat of adverse litigation was inherent for any tobacco company but ITG had never had any exposure to the U.S. market and the legal environment in Britain was more benign.</p>
<p>&quot;The demerger left ITG with pro forma negative net worth of 1,007 million stg and net debt of 1,071 million stg,&quot; IBCA said. &quot;In January 1997, an additional 185 million stg of debt was incurred and goodwill of 167 million stg written off with the purchase of Rizla, the world's leading manufacturer of branded cigarette papers,&quot; the agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless, ITG is highly cash generative, permitting the comfortable servicing of debt and enabling the debt outstanding to be reduced relatively easily.&quot;</p>
<p>IBCA said ITG was the world's most efficient cigarette producer (measured by profit per billion cigarettes produced) with high operating margins that should allow the balance sheet to be slowly rebuilt from retained earnings.</p>
