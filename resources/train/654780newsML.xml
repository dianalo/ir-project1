<p>--------------------------(JUNE 11)-----------------------------</p>
<p>* NZ short rates weaken at close in line with TWI</p>
<p>* Bonds rally, possibility of further eurokiwis seen</p>
<p>* Terms of trade data have no market impact</p>
<p>The New Zealand yield curve flattened a fraction at Wednesday's close as the short end weakened in line with a falling currency Trade-Weighted Index (TWI), and bonds rallied back to Tuesday's closing levels.</p>
<p>The 90-day bank bills ended at 7.14 percent, up three on Tuesday's close, as the TWI slipped to 67.12 from its 67.27 Tuesday finish.  </p>
<p>Trading in futures was extremely heavy with 256 deals involving 11,343 futures, with a face value of NZ$5.4 billion. The bank bill futures attracted record volume of 10,843 contracts amid a changeover of contracts.</p>
<p>The September contract finished six basis points weaker at 92.84 on volume of 6,625 contracts, while the June contract, which closed-out during the session, ended four weaker at 92.86.</p>
<p>Monetary conditions are currently settling around 100 basis points easier than the Reserve Bank's desired mix, but fears are fading that the bank will speak up ahead of its Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) on June 27.  </p>
<p>The RBNZ is expected to sanction easier conditions in that statement, but by how much remains the crunch question.</p>
<p>Merchant bank Bancorp said the direction of short rates over the next six months depended largely on the TWI and the extent of the official endorsement in the MPS of looser conditions.</p>
<p>But Bancorp saw limited scope for 90-day rates to hold below seven percent, which was proving to be a market barrier.</p>
<p>&quot;In our view, what is likely is further weakness in the TWI to below 67 over coming months, and thus the markets will potentially push 90 day rates back to the 7.5-7.75 percent region,&quot; it said in a market commentary.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, mid and long bonds rallied back to end on their Tuesday closing levels after opening around three points weaker. Dealers said a few traders were on the look-out for more eurokiwi issuance overnight.</p>
<p>&quot;Clearly we went to the lows the other day and pushed back up, and we're having a bit of a consolidation time now. We might try to push a bit lower in the next few days,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>March quarter terms of trade data matched expectations and had no market impact, economists said. Terms of trade rose 0.4 percent in the quarter and were down two percent on a year ago.</p>
