<title>RUSSIA: Russia's Lebed visits rebel Chechnya.</title>

<p>Russian security chief Alexander Lebed visited Chechnya on Thursday for talks with separatist leaders less than a week after signing an ambitious peace deal for the breakaway region.</p>
<p>&quot;Peace in Chechnya has many enemies, many hotheads and empty heads whose actions can derail the peace process,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted Lebed as saying on board the plane.</p>
<p>Interfax earlier said that during his two-day mission Lebed would meet rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov, with whom he signed the accord on Saturday, in the village of Novye Atagi some 25 km (15 miles) to the south of the capital Grozny.</p>
<p>A Lebed aide met Maskhadov in the same village on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The meeting is expected to try to iron out problems in implementing the peace deal, which defers a decision on Chechnya's political status for five years.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted Lebed as telling reporters he was worried by reports about separatists seizing hostages and pursuing supporters of pro-Moscow authorities in the breakaway region. Rebel leaders have denied such reports.</p>
<p>Lebed is President Boris Yeltsin's representative in Chechnya, but the 65-year-old president, who dropped from sight in late June and is now on holiday near Moscow, has not publicly backed Lebed's peace deal.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, seen as a rival to Lebed, has given the accord his guarded approval.</p>
<p>The first test of the deal is expected to be on Friday, the fifth anniversary of Chechnya's self-declared independence.</p>
<p>Interfax said Maskhadov had promised to ban celebratory parades in Grozny in favour of purely religious ceremonies.</p>
<p>With peace tentatively setting in across the region after nearly 21 months of war and tens of thousands of deaths, Grozny is setting out on the long road to reconstruction with more hope than confidence.</p>
<p>Fery Aalame, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Grozny, said on Wednesday some 80,000 to 100,000 people may have been forced to flee Grozny by the fighting.</p>
<p>&quot;The civilian population has suffered a lot, there is a complete lack of clean water...there is no medical structure,&quot; Aalame told reporters in Grozny.</p>
<p>The Red Cross is helping to restart water supplies and was bringing in some 600,000 litres (132,000 gallons) a day to the civilian population. It is also supplying food and medicines.</p>
<p>Russian military autorities said on Thursday that separatists had killed one servicemen and wounded two in five attacks on Russian positions in the last 24 hours, launched in violation of the truce.</p>
