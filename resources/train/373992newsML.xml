<p>Crude prices in Asia were steady to lower on Wednesday as players generally marked timed ahead of next-month trading.</p>
<p>A slightly bearish set of data from the American Petroleum Institute (API) overnight dampened sentiment slightly but paper Tapis was slightly up on day-earlier levels offering regional grades some support.</p>
<p>Most active March was quoted at $21.90/$22.05 per barrel on paper, versus a day-earlier $21.80/$22.10.</p>
<p>Indonesia grades were on hold awaiting the export allocations from Pertamina.  </p>
<p>But traders said they expected premiums to come down, although Belida could find some support from pockets of Asian demand for light sweet grades.</p>
<p>A producer has already sold more than one million barrels of March Tapis, after bringing forward barrels into prompt months for several months.</p>
<p>An Australian producer has also sold its March barrels of Kutubu, Cossack and Griffin to buyers outside Australia, which could prompt some March demand from Australia.  </p>
<p>But traders also noted that West African imports were active last week, with up to three VLCC's traded into South Korea for late February early March dates -- although some of the trades represented normal monthly requirements.</p>
<p>China also bought at least two VLCCs for late February and early March, but its wider interest to trade March and April dates was still awaited in the wake of Lunar New Year.</p>
<p>Futures prices in Asia were generally drifting late afternoon on Wednesday, after the API showed a bigger-than-expected build in crude and fall in refinery runs.</p>
