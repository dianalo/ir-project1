<headline>Hungary BCE wheat, maize futures fall continues.</headline>
<dateline>BUDAPEST 1996-12-10</dateline>

<p>Maize and wheat futures continued to drop on the Budapest Commodity Exchange (BCE) on Tuesday and traders said a bleak export outlook was behind the trend.</p>
<p>Maize futures dropped by the daily limit of 400 forints for all 1997 maturities, with March 1997 closing at 19,300 and December 1997 contracts ending at 21,400 forints.</p>
<p>&quot;Producers stuck to high prices throughout October and November but a higher than expected crop (of some six million tonnes) and poor export possibilities took their toll,&quot; said Robert Vajo of Termin brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;Even a few hundred thousand tonnes export next spring would not soak up the surplus,&quot; he said, adding that he did not see any factor that could stop prices falling in the short term.</p>
<p>Milling wheat futures also dropped by the 400-forint limit for all maturities, closing at 27,140 forints for January 1997 and 23,800 forints for December 1997.</p>
<p>&quot;Clients from Belarus, Poland and Russia are backing out of contracts, adding to the downward pressure on the Hungarian market,&quot; Vajo said.</p>
<p>Feed wheat price changes mirrored those of maize and milling wheat.</p>
<p>Blackseed prices rose for October and November 1997 to 44,000 forints, up 400, and 44,600 forints, up 200. However, these were just the first small deals in remote maturities, Vajo said.</p>
<p>&quot;These are little more than exploratory moves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Total turnover was a modest 421 million forints or 931 lots, of which 587 lots were milling wheat and 299 maize.</p>
<p>(Lot size is 20,000 kgs for all contracts. $=163.49 forints)</p>
