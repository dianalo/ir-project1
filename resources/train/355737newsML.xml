<title>SINGAPORE: SIMEX Nikkei futures end off highs, upside limited.</title>
<headline>SIMEX Nikkei futures end off highs, upside limited.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-02-04</dateline>

<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures shed a good part of their gains by Tuesday's close after failing to break above an early high. The gains were inspired by a better-than-expected land auction in central Tokyo the previous day.</p>
<p>The benchmark Nikkei 225 March contract finished 185 points firmer at 18,335 after hitting an early high of 18,670.</p>
<p>&quot;It looks like the market is adjusting positions ahead of tonight's meeting,&quot; said a dealer at a Japanese house, referring to the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.  </p>
<p>Most analysts and market participants expect the Fed to hold interest rates steady at the two-day meeting, which ends on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;If nothing happens tonight, I'd see a pullback to 18,500 tomorrow,&quot; said the trader, adding that the March Nikkei would need to breach Tuesday's peak of 18,670 to head higher.</p>
<p>A chartist with a local institution said the contract could come off to cover a gap near 18,000 before heading back up to test the 18,670 level.</p>
<p>&quot;I'll only be convinced of the upside if it breaks and closes above 19,300,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Taiwan stock index futures were not traded as the Taipei stock market was closed for the beginning of a seven-day Lunar New Year break. Trading will resume on February 11.</p>
<p>On Monday, the March MSCI Taiwan index contract ended at 315.9 against its opening 316.5 on a turnover of 62 lots.</p>
