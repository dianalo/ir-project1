<p>Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party was on Wednesday considering a return to the Constitutional Assembly (CA) following two hours of talks with CA chairman and ANC chief negotiator Cyril Ramaphosa.</p>
<p>Ramaphosa, secretary general of the ruling African National Congress, and Constitutional Development Minister Mohammed Valli Moosa headed four-a-side talks with an Inkatha team including Correctional Services Minister Sipo Mzimela.</p>
<p>Inkatha adviser Walter Felgate told Reuters his delegation had made proposals concerned a timetable for the correction of flaws identified by the Constitutional Court and about issues that should be up for further negotiation.</p>
<p>He said Inkatha would decide whether to return to the CA, which is hoping to iron out flaws in the post-apartheid constitution pointed out by the country's top court, after reporting back to Buthelezi. He declined to say when an answer was likely.</p>
<p>&quot;We are seeking to be constructive, but we are seeking to address the essential issues without which our constituency would not allow us to go back,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Felgate said the role of traditional leaders including the Zulu king would have to be included in future negotiations.</p>
<p>Inkatha negotiator Ben Ngubane said he was optimistic that the ANC would make it possible for his party to abandon its 18-month boycott of the constitution-writing process.</p>
<p>&quot;We are worried about the scope of the discussion and also the timeframes...We want room to really address issues, not prescribed by time.</p>
<p>&quot;Our concerns centre very much around the inclusiveness of local government and the responsibilities that the provinces can exercise,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ngubane said the Inkatha delegation did not renew its demand for international mediation on its dispute with the ANC.</p>
<p>The party quit the CA early last year after the ANC refused to implement a 1994 agreement to submit outstanding issues to foreign mediation and was not part of the May 8 vote to adopt a draft constitution for post-apartheid rule.</p>
<p>The draft was returned by the Constitutional Court last month for further work on a small number of issues, including the definition of local and provincial government powers.</p>
