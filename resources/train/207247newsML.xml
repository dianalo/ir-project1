<p>Pakistan's only Nobel prize winner, theoretical physicist Abdus Salam, died in Oxford, England, on Thursday, relatives in Islamabad said.</p>
<p>His brother, Abdul Wahab, told Reuters that Salam, 70, had died in the early hours at his Oxford home and that his body would be brought back to Pakistan on Saturday for burial.</p>
<p>Salam, who won a Nobel prize for his work in particle physics in 1979, will be buried in Rabwa, in Punjab province, a centre of the Ahmadi sect to which he belonged.</p>
<p>He was chief scientific adviser to the president of Pakistan for 11 years until 1974. He resigned in that year after Ahmadis were officially branded non-Moslems under the government of then prime minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto.</p>
<p>Salam was professor of theoretical physics at London's Imperial College of Science and Technology from 1957 to 1993. He founded the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste, Italy, and served as its director from 1964 to 1993.</p>
<p>Salam, who had been suffering from Parkinson's disease, is survived by his wife, two sons and four daughters.</p>
