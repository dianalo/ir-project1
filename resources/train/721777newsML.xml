<p>Financial markets will be keeping a close eye on retail sales data in the U.S. in the coming week for any signs of a pick-up in consumer spending and price pressures, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>On the other side of the Atlantic, UK labour market data and any signs of political tension between Germany and France over monetary union will preoccupy markets, they added.</p>
<p>&quot;The key thing is to see how the U.S. economy finished the second quarter,&quot; said Gerard Lyons, chief international economist at DKB International.</p>
<p>Economists expected U.S. June retail sales, due on Tuesday, to rise by 0.1 percent on the month after falling 0.1 percent in May. They said it was not yet clear if the slowdown in the U.S. economy in the second quarter would be transient or a trend set to carry over into Q3.</p>
<p>Lyons said U.S. consumer price data, due on Wednesday, should give further evidence of low inflation. The CPI is seen up 2.4 percent on the year versus a 2.2 percent rate in May.</p>
<p>But Eric Fishwick, international economist at Nikko Europe, said the CPI data would be a non-event.</p>
<p>&quot;I don't see much surprise there (CPI data),&quot; Fishwick said. &quot;The markets have a firm conviction the economic picture (in the U.S.) shows strong growth and low inflation.&quot;</p>
<p>He said it was too early for the market to start factoring in any U.S. interest rate move expectations.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a long way to the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting in August,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Some analysts said they would be focusing more on anecdotal evidence for clues on the state of the U.S. economy going into the third quarter.</p>
<p>&quot;We are looking to the Philadelphia Fed survey and the University of Michigan July numbers for signs of a pick up into the third quarter in the U.S.,&quot; said Dick Howard, senior economist at Julius Baer Investments.</p>
<p>The domestic focus in Britain will be on June labour market data due on Wednesday, analysts said, while on the Continent, the latest twists in the European monetary union (EMU) saga will continue to dominate the agenda.</p>
<p>&quot;France and Germany are quite clearly on a collision course (over EMU),&quot; said Lyons. &quot;The question is if that can be prevented for a while longer.&quot;</p>
<p>No attempt by the French to reduce their deficit to GDP ratio to the key 3.0 percent could lead to political tensions with Germany, he said.</p>
<p>Across the Channel, a big question mark remained over the UK inflation picture, Lyons said.</p>
<p>&quot;There shouldn't be any problems from the earnings data but the unemployment figures should confirm there is still a lot of strength left in the UK economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Lyons forecast UK May average earnings growth to remain around 4.5 percent, and June unemployment to show a fall of around 30,000.</p>
<p>UK producer price figures due on Monday were expected to highlight the deflationary impact of a strong sterling, analysts said.</p>
<p>The market would also be casting an eye on the minutes of the first newly independent Bank of England monetary policy committee meeting last month for an insight into the quarter point rate hike.</p>
<p>In Japan, markets would be looking to the quarterly BoJ branch managers meeting at the start of week for any hint of a change in interest rate policy, an unlikely scenario for the near term.</p>
<p>Howard at Julius Baer said markets would be keenly watching Japanese trade balance numbers due on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;A big surplus would give the Yen another kick upwards,&quot; he said. --International Bond Unit + 44 171 542 6176</p>
