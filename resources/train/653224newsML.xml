<p>A Colombian physician who prosecutors say methodically murdered a patient while the victim's grieving family stood confused by the bedside went on trial in this rural Florida city Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dr. Ernesto Pinzon, 37, would spend the rest of his life in jail without chance of parole if convicted of first-degree murder.</p>
<p>&quot;This is the story of a doctor who decided on his own without the consent of the victim or his family to end a life -- just as certainly as if he put a gun to his head,&quot; prosecutor John Agueros told jurors during opening arguments.</p>
<p>It was Pinzon's own colleagues at the Highlands Medical Centre who turned him in to police, Aguero said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think he just pulled a Kevorkian,&quot; one nurse told her supervisor, according to Agueros, referring to Jack Kevorkian, who is a major proponent of doctor-assisted suicide.</p>
<p>She watched Pinzon inject morphine, valium and potassium chloride -- sometimes used in lethal injection executions -- into Rosario Gurrieri, who died later that night.</p>
<p>But Pinzon's lawyers said the nurse did not trust foreign doctors and was ready to believe the worst of Pinzon, who moved to Florida 17 months ago from Puerto Rico where his family had lived since leaving Bogota when he was a child.</p>
<p>Gurrieri, 70, checked into the medical centre in Sebring Oct. 5 with lung cancer that had spread to his spine, liver and other vital organs. He suffered from a host of other ailments including congestive heart disease. His doctor had given him no more than two days to live.</p>
<p>&quot;It was illness, not the doctor that killed him. Dr. Pinzon is innocent of any crimes whatsoever,&quot; defence counsel Bill Fletcher told jurors during his opening argument.</p>
<p>He said Pinzon administered morphine in high doses because the patient's family begged that his pain be relieved. The potassium chloride was to slow a racing heartbeat that would have killed Guttieri.</p>
<p>During a recess, lead defence counsel Jack Edmund said the charges resulted from a frightened hospital staff that did not understand the medically sound course of medication.</p>
<p>He accused state attorney Jerry Hill, often mentioned as a candidate for Florida attorney general, of playing politics.</p>
<p>&quot;There may have been a substantial political misreading of the elements of this case,&quot; he said, refering to widespread public support for Pinzon in Sebring.</p>
<p>Much of the prosecution case rests on a statement Pinzon allegedly made to the family before administering the drugs</p>
<p>&quot;I don't like what I'm going to do but it has to be done,&quot; Pinzon told the family, according to testimony.</p>
