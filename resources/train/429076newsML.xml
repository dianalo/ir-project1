<p>Bosnian federation police shot dead a Djibouti-born man and captured a Frenchman on Sunday in a crackdown on &quot;terrorism&quot; in central Bosnia, the state news agency BH Press said.</p>
<p>Zeferini Biniam, 27, was killed and Lionel Dumont, 26, arrested a month after they were put on the federation wanted list over &quot;serious terrorist attacks&quot; and an attempted petrol station robbery in which a policeman was killed, it said.</p>
<p>On Sunday, BH Press said, special police units in Zenica sealed off a neighbourhood where Biniam and Dumont had been seen and moved in on their hideout.</p>
<p>Biniam and Dumont opened fire and wounded one policeman before police resorted to tear gas to flush them out, said BH Press. Biniam was killed in an ensuing shootout and Dumont arrested, it said.</p>
<p>&quot;All this points to the existence of an infiltrated and organised terrorist group charged with destabilising central Bosnia and achieving other objectives&quot;, the agency said.</p>
<p>The Zenica-Doboj Canton interior ministry said in a statement that it had &quot;implemented a wide range of operational and tactical measures aimed at thwarting terrorist activities&quot;.</p>
