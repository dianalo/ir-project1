<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ Dairy Board final payout rate 318 c/kg.</title>
<headline>NZ Dairy Board final payout rate 318 c/kg.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-05-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Dairy Board on Thursday announced a final price of 318c/kg of milk solids -- down 11.6 percent on last year's 360c/kg payout to farmers.</p>
<p>But the board effectively will add a further 3c/kg to its payout for the 1996-97 season by distributing tax credits to farmers.</p>
<p>For the average farmer in the main Waikato dairying region, each cent in the payout equates to more than $520 in farm income.  </p>
<p>But the board said the 1997-98 milk price was expected to fall further -- in the range of 290c/kg-305c/kg, a drop of between 4 percent and 7.2 percent.</p>
<p>Board chairman Sir Dryden Spring said the slump of nearly 12 percent in payment for milk solids was in spite of a 12 percent increase in production, to a record 822 million kg for the season.</p>
<p>The board has previously said its optimal growth target for milk production is between 3 percent and 4 percent.  </p>
<p>But the rise in the New Zealand dollar's value in key exchange rates against the U.S.dollar and the British pound sterling eroded the industry's earnings by $140 million -- equivalent of 17c/kg milk solids -- over the season.</p>
<p>Spring said the board expected further erosion of its earnings through adverse movements in the currency, as it was running out of room to delay those effects through hedging.</p>
<p>He did not expect any improvements in prices before the fourth quarter of 1997.  </p>
<p>But there has been a cumulative increase in production of 20 percent over the past two years, and the board will have to sell more than 250,000 tonnes more product this season, compared with 1995-96.</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the negative effects of currency and price movements, the board's added-value marketing in the consumer, food service and specialty ingredient business sectors generated an additional $100 million in revenues this year,&quot; Spring said.  </p>
<p>&quot;There is potential for market improvement later in the season,&quot; he said. If the trend of currency movements were to be reversed, the board would be in a good position to benefit.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the market and currency outlook, the board proposes to set its advance price at 255c/kg,&quot; he said. This would be reviewed and added to through the year.</p>
