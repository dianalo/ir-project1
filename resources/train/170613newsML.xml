<title>BELGIUM: EU warns Spain about 1996 budget deficit.</title>

<p>Spain has escaped losing billions of pesetas in EU funds despite missing its budget deficit target in 1995.</p>
<p>But the European Commission warned on Wednesday it would be watching to see that Madrid met its 4.4 percent forecast for 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;The Spanish authorities should be in no doubt of the consequences if the 4.4 percent objective is not met when the figures for 1996 are available,&quot; it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Commission said it would have suspended the payment of EU money under the so-called cohesion fund had it known when it made the first of its twice-yearly economic forecasts for the EU in the spring that the Spanish budget deficit in 1995 had been 6.6 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>The Commission did not say what the target was.</p>
<p>But Spain was now back on track regarding sound public finance, as demonstrated in the Commission's autumn economic forecasts released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;This suspension could have ended in autumn 1996, as the Commission's forecasts for the Spanish deficit matches the recommended target for 1996 of 4.4 percent&quot;, the statement said.</p>
<p>But it demanded a &quot;written declaration of assurance from the Spanish government confirming that the target of 4.4 percent will be fully respected&quot;.</p>
<p>The cohesion fund adopted in 1993 has set aside 15 billion European currency units to be shared among the EU's poorer members to help them catch up with their richer neighbours. Spain gets more than half of the cake.</p>
