<p>French President Jacques Chirac called on his government on Friday to do everything in its power to bolster economic growth, spokeswoman Catherine Colonna said.</p>
<p>She told reporters that Chirac told his government at a New Year ceremony that it must seek a better result in the fight against unemployment.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect the government to do everything to consolidate the return to economic growth, which remains the principle key to employment, by lowering taxation where this is possible by favouring consumption and investment, and by supporting the development of our companies and by continuing the improvements in public finances,&quot; she quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>The president had said that by the end of 1996 the economy was &quot;solid and competitive&quot;, she added.</p>
<p>Earlier, Prime Minister Alain Juppe told the president that the government would continue its reforms. Colonna quoted Juppe as also saying that France must stick to its international and European commitments as these were in France's interest.</p>
<p>Unemployment in France hit a record 12.7 percent in November.</p>
<p>France's most recent official forecast is for 2.3 percent growth in gross domestic product in 1997 after 1.3 percent for 1996.</p>
