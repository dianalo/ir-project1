<p>A low-fat diet rich in carbohydrates can help lower a major risk factor for breast cancer in women, according to a Canadian study published on Wednesday in the U.S. Journal of the National Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer to strike women, said Kathleen Pritchard, head of oncology at Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Center. It is the biggest killer of women under 50 in the Western world.</p>
<p>One woman in nine will develop the disease in her lifetime, according to the National Cancer Institute of Canada. Each year in Canada, 18,600 women develop the disease and 5,000 die from it.</p>
<p>Scientists have found in the past that breast density -- the relationship of fibrous tissue to fat -- is one of the most important risk factors for this type of cancer, second only to breast cancer gene mutation.</p>
<p>Women with extensive breast density are four to six times more likely to develop malignant lumps in their breasts.</p>
<p>The study by researchers at the Ontario Cancer Institute and Toronto's Princess Margaret Hospital found that the density of breast tissue can be reduced by a diet that is 15 percent fat and 65 percent complex carbohydrates.</p>
<p>&quot;The intervention we use involves a reduction in the intake of fat. So that means a reduction in the intake of meat and poultry and an increased intake of complex carbohydrates, so an increased intake of grains, fruits and vegetables &quot; Dr. Norman Boyd, head of epidemiology at the Ontario Cancer Institute and Princess Margaret Hospital, told Reuters.</p>
<p>In fact, low fat intake is found in countries where breast cancer is rare, which may indicate that fat itself could be one cause of the disease -- but this is yet to be proven.</p>
<p>The trial, which is part of the larger 10-year Canadian Diet and Breast Cancer Prevention Study, examined 817 women between 30 and 65 years over two years. All the women's breasts were more than 50 percent dense tissue, meaning they were higher-risk individuals.</p>
<p>In a related development, analysis of two other clinical trials by Canadian researchers have shown that the drug anastrozole -- marketed by Zeneca Pharma Inc. under the brand-name Arimidex -- can boost survival by 22 percent over megestrol acetate.</p>
<p>Megestrol acetate is currently the most prescribed drug for treatment of advanced breast cancer in post-menopausal women, Toronto-Sunnybrook's Pritchard told a media briefing.</p>
<p>The study said that Arimidex, which helps dry up secretions of estrogen in women who have gone through menopause, is also better tolerated and has fewer severe and life-threatening side-effects such as weight gain and blood clots than megastrol acetate.</p>
