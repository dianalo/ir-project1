<headline>BankAmerica's Peterson to retire, Helms resigns.</headline>
<dateline>SAN FRANCISCO</dateline>
<text>
<p>BankAmerica Corp. said Luke Helms, manager of retail banking, will resign as vice chairman effective Oct. 31 to pursue other opportunities.</p>
<p>In addition, Vice Chairman Thomas Peterson, manager of consumer banking operations worldwide, plans to retire in 1997 after a successor for his position is named.</p>
<p>BankAmerica said it was looking internally and externally for Peterson's successor. It also said that in order to streamline management of consumer banking operations, Helms' position, which reports to Peterson, will not be replaced.</p>
<p>Some industry analysts believed Helms, highly regarded in the banking sector, was leaving BankAmerica because he was overlooked for Peterson's position as the definitive head of retail banking.</p>
<p>Helms joined BankAmerica in 1993 from Seafirst Bank, BankAmerica's subsidiary in Washington state, where he was chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>&quot;I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at BankAmerica,&quot; Helms said in a statement. &quot;Dave Coulter is an excellent chief executive officer with a very clear idea of where he wants to lead the bank and he should have every opportunity to build his own team as he moves forward.&quot;</p>
<p>Helms added, &quot;At this point, however, my career goals are best achieved outside the BankAmerica organisation.&quot;</p>
