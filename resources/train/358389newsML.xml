<p>Spanish financial markets held their ground on Wednesday after weary traders brushed aside another wave of EMU worries.</p>
<p>Analysts said that although reports of a compromise on delaying Italy's membership of the single European currency could implicate Spain, they had failed to unnerve markets which have already been teased with such an option.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone is saying what they're supposed to say and as long as they continue to do so the markets won't be shaken,&quot; said Alfredo Urrutia, chief economist at Societe Generale in Madrid.</p>
<p>The Financial Times newspaper on Wednesday quoted unnamed senior monetary officials as saying Italy would be offered a deal that would delay its entry into EMU (economic and monetary union) until 2000 or 2001.</p>
<p>Germany denied it knew of any such a deal while Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi rejected the reports as false, unjustified and unfounded.</p>
<p>Spanish Economy Secretary Cristobal Montoro said he was sure Spain would be in the first wave of EMU entrants.</p>
<p>Some analysts said if Italy were to delay entry, the EU would be hard pushed to refuse Italy and accept Spain.</p>
<p>But they added that the markets had already been forced to face such an option and were not now overly concerned.</p>
<p>Comments from German bankers and officials that Italy and Spain might not make the front line for EMU whipped the carpet from under Spanish markets' feet on Monday. But by Wednesday they had recovered and marched ahead.</p>
<p>Some analysts said in any event, a deal to delay Italian entry could be positive for Spain's financial markets.</p>
<p>&quot;If this is an arrangement that would make EMU happen at all and it took away some of the obstacles against EMU happening between France, Germany and the Benelux countries, that in itself is a gain,&quot; said Henrik Lumholdt, chief economist at Bank of America in Madrid.</p>
<p>Spanish bonds brushed aside Wednesday's worries and trudged higher. By 1345 GMT, the 10-year 8.8 percent benchmark bono had risen to 113.88 from Tuesday's close of 113.50. The stock market also raced ahead, the Ibex-35 index of leading shares gaining 62.72 points, 1.18 percent, to 5,360.34.</p>
<p>In the currency market, traders said fear of central bank intervention was capping any weakness.</p>
<p>&quot;We've had the Bank of Spain intervening successfully around 85.00 and so there's a sense that if you try to push it much beyond that point you'll get your hands slapped,&quot; said Lumholdt.</p>
<p>By 1345 GMT, the peseta was trading at 84.61/62 to the mark after touching 85.00 earlier in the session and compared with levels late on Tuesday of 84.79/82.</p>
<p>In the longer run some analysts said bonds were set to receive the hardest blow from EMU worries.</p>
<p>&quot;Down the line a bigger reaction is likely in the bond market which is still discounting too happy an outcome of this complicated scenario,&quot; said one analyst.</p>
<p>The peseta, meanwhile, is expected to remain trapped in the 84.50 to 85.00 band.</p>
<p>In recent sessions, traders have seen the central bank selling marks against the peseta to hold the 85.00 level in the run up to a single currency. Analysts said they believed the central bank would continue to play its hand.</p>
<p>&quot;The Bank of Spain will continue to try to control the volatility...and fear of intervention will provide a cap,&quot; said Urrutia.</p>
