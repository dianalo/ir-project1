<p>Eighteen people including 16 policemen were killed on Friday when Maoist guerrillas attacked a police station in southern India, United News of India said.  </p>
<p>The news agency said members of the outlawed People's War Group (PWG) attacked Karakugudem police station in Khammam district of Andhra Pradesh state and took weapons and ammunition.</p>
<p>In November, guerrillas from the same left-wing group killed 13 policemen and one civilian in a raid on a village police station in Andhra Pradesh.</p>
<p>The PWG is one of many Maoist rebel groups considered part of the Naxalite movement, which started in India in the 1960s among groups who split from the main communist party.</p>
<p>It was first banned in Andhra Pradesh in 1992 but gained a year-long reprieve beginning in June 1995 before being banned again in July of this year.</p>
