<p>Slovenian shares fell for the fifth straight day on Wednesday as heavy selling pressure on shares of food maker Kolinska wiped out strong gains in shopping center operator BTC.</p>
<p>Traders said the outlook for the market remained clouded by the postponement of the ratifaction of Slovenia's association accord with the European Union, which is expected to help bring fresh foreign capital to the small Alpine country.</p>
<p>The SBI index fell 0.45 percent or 5.85 points to close at 1,288.77. The index lost a total of 2.29 percent over the past five days.</p>
<p>Overall 12 shares fell, three rose and 13 were untraded. Turnover rose to 64.4 million tolars from 55.8 million.</p>
<p>&quot;Most shares went down, so I can easily say that today was a black day for our market and there is no sign of improvement in the short term,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect shares to stagnate over the summer -- only the ratification of the EU agreement could mean a turnaround, indicating to international investors that our market is definitely opening up for foreign capital,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>Last week the country's constitutional court delayed the ratification of the treaty, which was signed in June last year, and ordered parliament to change the country's constitution in order to allow foreigners to own real-estate.</p>
<p>Food maker Kolinska was the most actively traded share, falling 34 tolars or 1.79 percent to 1,862 tolars on turnover of 4,531 lots.</p>
<p>Issue C of drug company Lek was the leading decliner, losing 7.37 percent to 22,510 tolars on volume of only one share. Brokerage Dadas was the top gainer, jumping 10.42 percent to 14,400 tolars on volume of 28 shares.</p>
<p>Market participants said both moves were a technical reaction after the shares moved in opposite directions on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Shopping centre operator BTC, whose global depository receipts are expected to be listed on the SEAQ segment of the London Stock Exchange on June 20, rose 1.98 percent to 14,400 tolars on volume of 748 shares.</p>
<p>&quot;As expected, yesterday's news did not make for a revolution on the market today, because expectations of the listing were already priced in,&quot; one trader said, adding that BTC was likely to rise up to 15,000 tolars in the near future. -- Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
