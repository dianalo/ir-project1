<p>Royalist forces of deposed Cambodian First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh will wage armed resistance against Hun Sen only as a last resort if peaceful means fail, a Ranariddh aide said on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The prince does not want to have bloodshed. The first solution is to negotiate and get Hun Sen to respect the Paris peace agreement and restore democracy,&quot; said Ahmad Yahaya, a member of Ranariddh's entourage.  </p>
<p>&quot;If we don't achieve this, as a final resort we would have to create a resistance movement. But it is still too early to say we want to create such a movement,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ahmad Yahaya told Reuters that Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC party was still in government, though Hun Sen had evicted royalist forces from Phnom Penh and declared Ranariddh was no longer the first premier.</p>
<p>Therefore it had to pursue peaceful negotiations first to find a political solution, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;But we also have army and forces. If they attack us we have no choice but to fight back,&quot; he added.</p>
