<p>The Air Force on Monday blamed crew error in the August crash in Wyoming of a C-130 cargo plane that accompanied President Bill Clinton on vacation and which killed all eight crew members and a Secret Service agent on board.</p>
<p>&quot;The accident investigation board report concludes that crew error caused the crash,&quot; the Air Force said in a statement on the incident, in which the four-engine plane slammed into a mountain near Jackson Hole on Aug. 17.</p>
<p>&quot;The crew failed to monitor the aircraft's position and flight path relative to high terrain surrounding the Jackson Hole Airport,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The C-130 was on a presidential support mission and had taken off from Jackson Hole headed for John F. Kennedy Airport in New York when it hit Sleeping Indian Mountain in the Bridger-Teton National Forest, about nine miles (15 km) east of Jackson Hole.</p>
<p>Clinton had left Jackson Hole by helicopter, where he vacationed the previous week, several hours before the crash.</p>
<p>The plane was carrying Secret Service agent Aldo Franscoia, presidential vehicles and other equipment.</p>
<p>Gen. Ronald Fogelman, the Air Force chief of staff, stressed in the statement that the C-130 remained one of the service's safest planes and that &quot;we have the highest regard for, and confidence in, all our C-130 air crews around the world.&quot;</p>
<p>But the the 15-page report by Col. Robert Skolasky said that several mistakes were made, including failure of the pilot and crew of the flight, dubbed &quot;Havoc 58,&quot; to review quick climb requirements in such a mountainous area.</p>
<p>&quot;They were complacent and not situationally aware of their proximity to that (mountainous) terrain,&quot; said Skolasky, the accident investigation officer.</p>
<p>The report noted that although no clouds were reported below 12,000 feet (3,600 metres) when the crash occurred at about 10:30 p.m. local time, &quot;numerous witnesses state that it was a dark night and the mountaintops were not visible.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Radar information, which would have been showing on the navigator's radar scope, was not correctly interpreted&quot; during the brief and fatal flight, according to Skolasky.</p>
<p>He said that Capt. Kevin Earnest was at the controls when the plane took off and he flew the aircraft until about 15 second before impact.</p>
<p>Capt. Kimberly Jo Wielhouwer had just taken the controls when the plane slammed into the mountain, he added.</p>
