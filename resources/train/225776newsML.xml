<p>German shares crowned a record-breaking week with an all-time high on Friday as the seemingly unstoppable market surprised share experts by hitting most year-end targets a month in advance.</p>
<p>The DAX index of Germany's top 30 stocks closed bourse dealings at an all-time high of 2,845.52 points, up 28.03 points, or 0.99 percent, marking a gain of over 80 points, or three percent in just one week.</p>
<p>&quot;The dynamism of the current climb had been surprising,&quot; admitted Peter Pietsch, economist at Germany's Commerzbank.</p>
<p>Market analysts, who had widely forecast a year-end level of 2,850 points, said the DAX could now charge ahead to 2,900 points by the end of the year. Some said the once-unthinkable 3,000 point level now seemed within the grasp of the market.</p>
<p>&quot;If you had asked me six weeks ago if we could climb this fast I would have said 'no', but now we can see 3,000 points,&quot; said Andreas Heine, analyst at Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechselbank, &quot;But we've had very good reasons for the climb.&quot;</p>
<p>The DAX index has gained almost 600 points, or 26 percent, since the beginning of the year, but in the last couple of months the rally has accelerated even faster.</p>
<p>The market was propelled forward by the dream combination of strength in German government bonds, which have reached all-time highs, and a firmer dollar, benefiting German exporting sectors, in particular the chemical industry.</p>
<p>&quot;Decisive at the moment is the low level of the mark which is linked to the increased likelihood that there will be a bigger currency union in 1999,&quot; said Juergen Callies, economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors had moved out of the security of the German mark and into the bonds of southern European countries after the Italian lira rejoined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) on Monday, boosting optimism that monetary union would indeed go ahead in Europe.</p>
<p>The dollar received a further boost against the mark, penetrating the crucial 1.53 mark level, after the Bank of France monetary policy council member Jean-Pierre Gerard said on Thursday he favoured a stronger dollar against the mark.</p>
<p>Gerard also said that short-term interest rates should be cut in Germany and France to further boost the dollar and help exporters in the two countries.</p>
<p>Dealers said this comment had helped propel the German bond market forward, which previously had almost ruled out the possibility of any more rate-easing.</p>
<p>But some analysts warned that euphoria had caused the market to lose sight of economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>&quot;The current high level of the DAX prices in a lot of optimism and is only justified when interest rates continue to fall and company results are very good next year,&quot; said Commerzbank's Pietsch.</p>
<p>&quot;It is our responsibility to warn that the market cannot always go up,&quot; Pietsch said, warning that fears of interest rate rises were likely to creep into the market again as the German economy picked up.</p>
<p>Commerzbank analysts said 2,700 points was a more realistic medium term level for the DAX index.</p>
<p>Some traders agreed, saying the market was very overheated at the moment and would benefit from a pause before advancing further.</p>
<p>&quot;But any fall in the German market should be used as a buying opportunity,&quot; said Vereinsbank analysts.</p>
