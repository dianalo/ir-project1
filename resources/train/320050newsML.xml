<title>JAPAN: Tokyo stocks tumble again on policy malaise.</title>

<p>Battered Japanese stocks took another tumble on Monday, depressed by the government's unwavering resolve to raise taxes and by the insolvency of a once high-flying chain of sushi bars.</p>
<p>The key Nikkei average of 225 leading shares slid more than 800 points in early trade as players gambled that a policy speech by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto later in the day would fail to deliver any boost for stocks.</p>
<p>As expected, the government resisted calls from the stock market to reconsider its economic policies, offering no special relief for the market and vowing to press ahead with planned tax increases. But the index clawed back a little by the close, ending down 609.70 points at 17,480.34</p>
<p>The share price plunge helped push the dollar to a 46-month high of 117.90 yen, partly on fears that the weak stock market would cause foreign investors to ditch the Japanese currency.</p>
<p>In his policy speech to the new session of parliament, Hashimoto vowed to forge ahead with a rise in the sales tax to five percent from three percent on April 1 and end two trillion yen ($17 billion) worth of special income tax cuts. He also warned that more belt-tightening was in store, but announced no new measures or revisions to previously announced plans.</p>
<p>Stocks had started the day on a sombre note after a chain of sushi restaurants said it was seeking protection from creditors under Japan's bankruptcy laws, joining a growing list of companies crushed under &quot;bubble&quot; era debts.</p>
<p>The move underlined the extent of the economic woes left over from the late 1980s bubble of aggressive expansion, soaring asset prices and unbridled consumerism.</p>
<p>Kyotaru Co Ltd filed for protection on Sunday at a Tokyo court with huge debts totalling some $865 million, becoming the first failure among firms listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange since mid-1993. The chain had expanded abroad and invested heavily in the 1980s and struggled to restructure when the bubble burst in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Traders said the morning stock slide was mostly led by a futures sell-off which signalled the market's disapproval of Hashimoto's anticipated policy statement.</p>
<p>Some market participants bought futures late last week on hopes that the government would try to boost the stock market once parliament opened on Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>The stock market has fallen heavily since the start of the year on worries about the health of the banking industry and fears that the proposed tax increases could strangle Japan's tentative economic recovery.</p>
<p>Concern over an economic slowdown has been weighing on the market since the budget for the fiscal year starting on April 1 was approved by the cabinet in late December.</p>
<p>Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita on Monday attempted to calm those fears, telling a central bank branch managers' meeting that Japan's economy was still gradually recovering and that the strength of that recovery was growing gradually.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchange market, the slide in share prices prompted selling of yen by overseas operators.</p>
<p>But dealers said the greatest action in the dollar was against the mark, where massive bids by overseas players, particularly U.S. funds, sent the greenback surging.</p>
<p>The key March Japanese government bond futures contract also ended up sharply due to the plunge in share prices, on the assumption that a weak stock market means Japanese interest rates will stay at low levels. ($1=117 yen)</p>
