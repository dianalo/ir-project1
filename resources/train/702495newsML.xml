<p>Commerce Secretary William Daley said on Wednesday the administration expects to send legislation to Congress soon that would implement two international treaties that update copyright laws to the digital age.</p>
<p>&quot;I would hope that in a very short period we will have legislation to put forward,&quot; Daley told reporters.</p>
<p>The treaties agreed to by the United Nations' World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) in December have to be ratified by the Senate, and implementing legislation has to be passed by both the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>Daley said it was important that the United States act on the treaties that update international copyright laws to take account of new digital technologies before the end of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Until we act we can't expect others to,&quot; Daley said.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that there was a brewing controversy between Internet service providers that do not want to be held liable for third party transmissions of pirated material and copyright owners who want their works protected.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a great controversy of content-versus-liability issue that has to be addressed,&quot; Daley said.</p>
<p>He said the legislation was one of the department's most immediate challenges in trying to carry out President Bill Clinton's proposals announced on Tuesday to promote commerce in cyberspace.</p>
<p>Daley heads to Germany next week to attend a European conference on global information technologies being held in Bonn. He said the United States will participate only as an observer but that he will have a chance to outline Clinton's vision of cyberspace commerce largely unfettered by government regulation and taxes.</p>
