<p>Valero Energy Corp chief executive officer Bill Greehey said on Friday that the company would look to buy other refineries once a deal with PG&amp;E Corp is completed to sell its natural gas operations.</p>
<p>Greehey said Valero, whose main asset will be its high-tech Corpus Christi, Texas refinery, will have more than a billion dollars in equity and a debt-to-capital ratio of less than 17 percent by the time the sale to PG&amp;E is completed in July. &quot;That's going to give us an opportunity to look at acquisitions and grow the business,&quot; he told Reuters.  </p>
<p>&quot;We'll be looking at acquiring other refineries that are synergistic to our refinery and also where we think we can improve their operations and their yields and capacity,&quot; Greehey said.</p>
<p>He did not think the new Valero would be a takeover target, saying &quot;We want to be independent.&quot;</p>
<p>Greehey said Valero was still pursuing a proposed $450 million project to produce the gasoline additive MTBE in Mexico. He said the company had written off the on-again, off-again deal, but a &quot;major company&quot; in Mexico had come forward to ask Valero to take another look at it.  </p>
<p>&quot;They're looking at it and they want us to do something, so we're evaluating that. It's not dead,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The project, a plant to produce 17,000 barrels of MTBE daily, was put on hold first because of the Mexican economic crisis following the 1994 peso devaluation and later because of the difficulty of getting financing. MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, is an additive that makes gasoline burn cleaner and raises octane.</p>
<p>PG&amp;E and Valero announced on Friday that PG&amp;E would buy Valero's 7,500-mile natural gas pipeline and processing plants for $1.5 billion in stock and debt assumption.  </p>
<p>Greehey predicted that the proposed deal, which must be approved by shareholders, would boost Valero's stock price, saying it was &quot;a great deal.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of people didn't think we could get this kind of a price for these assets...so I think a lot of people are going to be re-evaluating the stock and I think there's still a lot of upward movement in the stock,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Valero said earlier that 28 companies had expressed interest in its pipeline, but it narrowed it down to five bidders. Greehey said the decision came down to two bids that were &quot;much higher&quot; than the others, and PG&amp;E won out.</p>
