<p>Canada's unemployment rate stayed at a stubborn 9.7 percent in February, unchanged from January, Statistics Canada said on Friday.</p>
<p>The number of jobs created during the month fell by 18,700 to 13.74 million, while the percentage of people actively looking for work remained flat at 64.6 percent, the government agency said.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an absolutely soft report with no redeeming features,&quot; said David Rosenberg, senior economist at brokerage Nesbitt Burns in Toronto.</p>
<p>The month saw 19,000 more part-time jobs, but 38,000 fewer full-time workers.</p>
<p>Canadian women beared the brunt of the full-time job loss. About 44,000 adult women lost their jobs during February, although part-time employment for women has been growing steadily since December 1994, Statscan said.</p>
<p>Employment in the retail and agriculture sectors lost ground in February. The decline was partially offset by gains in transportation, storage and communications. Construction employment was unchanged, and manufacturing jobs stayed flat, the agency said.</p>
