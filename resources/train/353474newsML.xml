<title>UK: Euro shares rise before U.S. Fed mulls rates.</title>
<headline>Euro shares rise before U.S. Fed mulls rates.</headline>

<p>European stocks mostly moved higher on Tuesday but with little conviction as investors faced two anxious days awaiting news on U.S. interest rates, the issue which has haunted this year's bull runs.</p>
<p>The dollar held firm in tight ranges, with dealers likewise transfixed by a meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-making arm starting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>With the United States apparently enjoying low-inflation economic growth, logic dictates that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should leave rates unchanged.</p>
<p>But markets face a long wait to hear whether logic will prevail as no announcement on rates is expected until the two-day meeting ends late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, the DAX index actually closed at a record high of 3,067.06. But that was a rise of 4.77 points or just 0.16 percent and across the continent turnover was low.</p>
<p>French shares failed to sustain an early rise and the CAC-40 was down 2.28 points at 2,506.27 by mid afternoon.</p>
<p>London tried to cling on to its early gains, but a lower opening on Wall Street -- the Dow Jones industrial average was down 9.24 at 6,796.92 after half an hour's trade -- took its toll.</p>
<p>By mid afternoon, the FTSE-100 index had slipped from morning highs and was up a scant 10.5 points at 4,268.3.</p>
<p>&quot;It's very dull. People want to get the FOMC out of the way before doing anything,&quot; one market maker said. &quot;It would be a nasty shock if the Fed put up rates this week.&quot;</p>
<p>But three years ago to the day, the Fed delivered just such a nasty shock, raising interest rates just when the market least expected them.</p>
<p>Stock markets plunged around the globe in response and this time nobody wants to get caught out.</p>
<p>In London, investors have their own worries as British monetary authorities are scheduled to hold a regular meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Economists expect finance minister Kenneth Clarke to continue resisting a rate rise so close to the election which must be held by the end of May. But Bank of England governor Eddie George has called for higher interest rates to nip inflation in the bud.</p>
<p>&quot;The market will be on edge until (the meetings) are over,&quot; said one London dealer. &quot;If anybody is looking for a change in rates it will probably be here rather than in the U.S. ... But neither looks very likely.&quot;</p>
<p>Stocks have stormed ahead this year but any interest rate rise, which would make investments other than shares more attractive, could throw markets both side of the Atlantic into reverse.</p>
<p>The approaching results season in the Britain is also keeping investors sidelined as worries persist over whether sterling's strength will hit exporters.</p>
<p>The story was much the same on foreign exchange markets. The dollar was muted, its movements small as the market awaited the FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>The mark's strength against other currencies also dampened the dollar, along with nerves about yen selling before a meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven industrial nations at the weekend.</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.6410 marks and 122.18 yen at mid afternoon, down from its late Monday European level of 1.6436 marks but up from 121.83 yen.</p>
<p>Gold showed some unaccustomed strength in the morning with dealers saying it had been oversold.</p>
<p>But as so often, it did not last long. By mid afternoon bullion had slipped to $345.75 an ounce from a morning fix at $346.30 and a $346.25 close on Monday.</p>
