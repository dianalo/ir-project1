<title>USA: Senators ask O'Leary to probe high propane prices.</title>
<headline>Senators ask O'Leary to probe high propane prices.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. Senators Pete Domenici and Frank Murkowski on Thursday urged Secretary of Energy Hazel R. O'Leary to review the causes of &quot;troubling&quot; price increases for propane and how inventories have shrunk to &quot;their lowest level in 27 years.&quot;</p>
<p>In a letter to O'Leary, the two Republican senators said retail prices of the residential heating fuel had increased by more than 30 percent over the past year, reaching heights not seen since 1990.  </p>
<p>They said average retail residential prices had jumped to nearly $1.20 a gallon from only 92 cents a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;Moreover, in certain states the price increases are even more dramatic. For example, propane is now $1.61 per gallon in Rhode Island,&quot; the senators said.</p>
<p>Murkowski, of Alaska, is chairman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. Domenici, of New Mexico, chairs the Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development.</p>
<p>Both come from rural states, where propane is a widely used heating fuel.  </p>
<p>The fuel, a gas derived from both crude oil and natural gas and then liquified under pressure, is also vital for a variety of agricultural uses -- particularly for drying corn and other crops after they are hauled from the fields.</p>
<p>Spot prices of the fuel, what refiners charge traders and wholesale distributors, have skyrocketed even more dramatically than retail residential rates.</p>
<p>In the Midwest, they have soared 20 cents a gallon this week, reaching seven-year highs of $1.00 a gallon on Wednesday in the midcontinent trading hub of Conway, Kansas.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are writing to ask that the Department of Energy review this situation to determine the reason for the price increases and low inventories, and to consider if anything can be done to help protect consumers,&quot; the senators wrote.</p>
<p>Traders said barebones inventories have helped spur panic buying in the Midwest propane spot market, one of the nation's largest markets for the clean-burning fuel.</p>
<p>And they predicted those spiralling costs could force retailers to pass their pain on to residential customers -- pushing costs to homeowners even higher.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's absolutely gone crazy. A lot of our low and moderate income users will suffer,&quot; said Bob Pascal, owner of United Propane Inc of Maryland -- one of the country's largest independent propane retailers.</p>
<p>And he said hundreds of smaller distributors would have difficulty staying afloat because they can only pass a portion of their higher costs on to farmers and homeowners.</p>
<p>&quot;People won't be able to stay in business if prices stay this high because the refineries expect them to pay up within ten to thirty days,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Murkowski and Domenici said propane inventories in the Gulf Coast, source of much of the nation's output, &quot;are at their lowest in 27 years.&quot; Historical data on other regions was not immediately available.</p>
<p>Midwest stocks in primary storage stand at 15.2 million gallons, 27 percent less than last year, according to the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group.</p>
<p>Stocks in region have been battered by sharp crop-drying demand this year and a simultaneous early cold snap last month -- exacerbated by the oil industry's recent drive to minimize inventories as a cost-savings measure.</p>
