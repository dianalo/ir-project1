<title>UK: DOLLAR/YEN JUMPS IN EUROPE AFTER RUBIN'S COMMENTS.</title>
<headline>DOLLAR/YEN JUMPS IN EUROPE AFTER RUBIN'S COMMENTS.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>The dollar bounded higher in early Europe to stand over one yen up from 122.58 yen in late European trade after U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said currencies should not be used as instruments of trade policy, despite concern about Japan's trade surplus.</p>
<p>&quot;The comments (Rubin) suggest the dollar is still in an uptrend and dollar/yen should go higher,&quot; said Stuart Frost, currency analyst at NatWest Markets.</p>
<p>At 0856 GMT the dollar was trading at 123.88/93 yen against 122.58/68 in late Europe on Thursday. Against the mark, the dollar was also firmer at 1.6744/54 marks vs 1.6680/90.</p>
<p>During a visit to Japan, Rubin urged on Friday Japan guard against a resurgence of its trade surplus but rejected suggestions that a stronger yen was the best way to do that.</p>
<p>&quot;It is critical that Japan's current account surplus not rise again to a level that is detrimental to global growth, that causes trade friction with Japan's trading partners and that could fuel protectionist sentiments,&quot; he told business leaders after a meeting with Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.</p>
<p>Earlier, Rubin had told reporters: &quot;We don't believe in anybody using their currency for trade policies -- us or anybody else.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts said while the dollar had reacted with relief to what seemed like a relatively conciliatory line taken by Rubin, some said his message was mixed.</p>
<p>&quot;Rubin said he didn't think anyone should use the currency as a way of influencing trade policy. At the same time he said it is important the Japanese current account surplus doesn't rise or protectionist sentiment will increase,&quot; said Adrian Schmidt, international economist at Chase Investment Bank.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a bit of a veiled threat,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Rubin said Japan needs to promote strong domestic demand, open up its markets more to imports and deregulate its economy.</p>
<p>Japan's trade surplus rose in February for the first time in two years, as the weak yen helped make the nation's exports more competitive in world markets.</p>
<p>Rubin leaves Tokyo later on Friday for a meeting of Asia-Pacific finance ministers in the Philippines.</p>
<p>As Rubin's Japan visit comes to an end, currency markets will be focusing on key U.S. jobs data due at 1330 GMT.</p>
<p>Strong figures, said analysts, would be favourable for dollar/mark but would also raise a spectre over U.S. asset markets. Blue-chip stocks closed lower on Thursday for the fourth time in five days amid lingering fears of rising rates.</p>
<p>Reuter forecasts for March non-farm payrolls show a rise of 196,000 jobs in March against a rise of 339,000 in February while average hourly earnings are forecast to have risen by 0.4 percent in March against 0.2 percent in February.</p>
