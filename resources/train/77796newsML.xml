<p>Veteran Bobby Wadkins, a non-winner in 658 events on the PGA Tour, putted superbly to lead after the first round at the $1 million Buick Challenge on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I putted like Ben Crenshaw. I have his caddie this week. Maybe it's rubbing off on me,&quot; Wadkins said after a bogey-free eight-under-par 64 in a testing breeze at pretty Callaway Gardens.</p>
<p>He stood one stroke ahead of fellow American Jim McGovern, while Davis Love, Olin Browne, Michael Bradley, Stewart Cink and Len Mattiace were two shots behind.</p>
<p>Wadkins, 45, has the dubious record of earning more prize money than any other non-winner on tour. He has accumulated $2,551,570 since joining the tour in 1975, enough to live very comfortably, but not necessarily earn the ovewhelming respect of his fellow professionals, who judge their peers by victories.</p>
<p>&quot;It makes you wonder if there's a reason why you put in all the hard work,&quot; he said. &quot;Today's the reason why you keep coming to work every day. Nobody is more surprised than me.</p>
<p>&quot;I've led a bunch of tournaments, but never at the very end. Hopefully this will be the week.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm in no-man's zone. Being 45, I'm not old enough for the Senior Tour, and a little too old for the kids out here.</p>
<p>&quot;The best part of my game is the driver, and if you drive the ball well here you have a chance to make some birdies. I like the course.&quot;</p>
<p>Wadkins made six birdies, plus an eagle at the par-five seventh where he sank a 35-footer.</p>
<p>Several well-known players were within striking distance, including Love, who helped the United States retain the Presidents Cup against the Internationals two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Love was not happy with his game early, despite an eagle at the second hole.</p>
<p>&quot;My ball-striking was a little shaky at first,&quot; he said. &quot;I started out missing fairways and a few greens but I was still scoring.&quot;</p>
<p>Despite a breeze and wiry rough, the field averaged a low 71.5 strokes, mainly because the four par-fives all played easily.</p>
