<title>USA: U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Expiration or profit-taking?.</title>
<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Expiration or profit-taking?.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>The expiration Friday of May U.S. stock index options could be one reason for the market's sharp decline, but several options traders said profit-taking was a more likely reason.</p>
<p>In late trading, the bellwether Dow industrial average was down 94 points at 7,239, above its session low of about 7,203 reached in afternoon trading.</p>
<p>Among broader indices, the S&amp;P 100 was off about 10 at 818.27 and the S&amp;P 500 fell roughly nine to 832.71. June S&amp;P 500 futures lost 10 to 834.75.</p>
<p>So was the market down because of the expiration?  </p>
<p>&quot;It's possible but I don't see it,&quot; said one index options trader. &quot;It's not hitting me over the head.&quot;</p>
<p>He noted that the Nasdaq composite index also posted a sharp decline, losing nearly 11 points to about 1,343. It reached a session low at about 1,340.</p>
<p>&quot;You've got Hewlett-Packard down 6-3/8. That took down all the tech stocks and that took down the whole market,&quot; said Harrison Roth, a first vice president at Cowen &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Hewlett shares were down 6-3/8 at 52-1/2 on nearly 17 million shares after reporting disappointing fiscal second quarter earnings after the close Thursday.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't think (the selloff) really has anything to do with the expiration,&quot; one index option broker said. &quot;I think it's profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;What's down 100 (on the Dow) when we've gone up 100 day after day?&quot; the broker said.</p>
<p>He added that uncertainty over next week's Federal Open Market Committee was most likely a driving force behind the profit-taking.</p>
<p>&quot;Nobody knows what (Federal Reserve Chairman) Greenspan is going to do,&quot; he said. &quot;They had thought he was going to raise rates, but now they're talking about him not doing it.  </p>
<p>&quot;Uncertainty is what kills this market,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Late-session order imbalances from the New York Stock Exchange were all on the sell side.</p>
<p>Through Thursday, options traders were expecting an upside bias to the expiration, but a large number of the OEX calls were exercised Thursday, weakening that argument.</p>
<p>Traders said the sharp selloff in Hewlett off the opening bell effectively wiped out any chance of an early upside move.</p>
<p>May SPX options settled at the SPX opening price Friday and OEX options settle Saturday morning.  </p>
<p>Traders said the one sure effect on the market of the expiration was a pickup in volume, at least on the options side.</p>
<p>&quot;They've been in a fast market almost all day,&quot; the index options trader said, referring to the OEX trading pit.</p>
<p>In the OEX, the May 820 calls, which until today looked to be expiring in-the-money, were the most active, with turnover of more than 43,100 contracts. They fell 8-15/16 to 1/16.</p>
<p>The OEX May 820 put, which rose 6-1/2 to 7-1/2, traded roughly 43,000 contracts.</p>
