<title>FINLAND: BENEFON EXTENDS GAINS ON GSM ANNOUNCEMENT.</title>
<headline>BENEFON EXTENDS GAINS ON GSM ANNOUNCEMENT.</headline>
<dateline>HELSINKI 1997-03-05</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in Finnish mobile phone maker Benefon Oy rallied further on Wednesday as news of its GSM type approval announcement spread among investors, but some brokers felt the share had reached its short term peak.</p>
<p>At 1255/1055 GMT, Benefon traded at 117.30 markka, up 5.40 markka or nearly five percent. The share earlier touched a 13-month high of 123.00 markka -- it highest since January 3, 1996. Trade was a lively 6.9 million markka.</p>
<p>Some brokers said Benefon was unlikely to rise further until more details emerged about its long-awaited first GSM handset.</p>
<p>They said recent sharp gains in the stock were only based on Benefon's announcement on Monday that it had won type approval for its GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications), handset so could now move to start producing and marketing the product.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a rally is unsustainable,&quot; a broker said, referring also to the typical high volatility in the stock.</p>
<p>But another said a current road-show by telecoms giant Nokia in the U.S. boosted the upside also for Benefon, and saw the share soon rising to about 150 markka provided Nokia can keep its upward trend.</p>
<p>&quot;Benefon is still making good business, and it can benefit from the expected escalation of the cellular phone market,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Benefon has risen gradually since February 11, when it advanced 8.00 markka to 87.00 on market talk it would soon launch its GSM product.</p>
<p>It has risen some 26 percent since Monday, but remains well short of its life high of 229 markka reached in August 1995. It closed at 93.00 markka last Friday.</p>
