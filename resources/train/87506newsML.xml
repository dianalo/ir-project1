<p>Property tycoon Mark Guterman appeared to do a u-turn on Tuesday when he said he would not be making a cash injection into troubled Manchester City.</p>
<p>Guterman, a 36-year-old millionaire who is currently the chairman of third division Chester, cancelled a news conference at which he was expected to announce details of a proposed offer to City, after meeting City chairman Francis Lee.</p>
<p>At the weekend it had been reported that Guterman was preparing to lead a consortium which would buy the club from Lee for 35 million pounds ($54.8 million).</p>
<p>But Guterman said in a statement on Tuesday: &quot;I have had an amicable meeting with the Manchester City chairman Francis Lee.</p>
<p>&quot;I remain chairman of Chester City Football Club and will devote all of my efforts towards ensuring the future and development of the club. Promotion is my aim for Chester City.&quot;</p>
<p>Manchester City, who were relegated from the premier league last season, have made a poor start to this season. </p>
<p>They are 14th in division one, lost to minnows Lincoln in the league cup and on Monday former player Willie Donachie became the seventh to turn down the chance of becoming the club's new manager since Alan Ball was sacked at the end of August.</p>
