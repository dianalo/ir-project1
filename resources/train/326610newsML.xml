<title>JAPAN: JGBs firmer at Tokyo close despite stock's rebound.</title>

<dateline>TOKYO 1997-01-22</dateline>
<text>
<p>Key March 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) futures closed firmer on Wednesday as the JGB market ignored a rebound in Tokyo stocks.</p>
<p>Traders said the JGB market was strongly supported by investors' firm demand in cash bonds, including newly auctioned 20-year JGBs.</p>
<p>&quot;Outside factors, such as stocks and currency rates, were uncertain. Thus, traders shifted their concerns to the supply/demand balance,&quot; said a city bank dealer.</p>
<p>The key March contract was up 0.07 at 126.22 after opening at 126.00.  </p>
<p>The contract moved between 125.88 and 126.35 with 45,556 contracts changing hands.</p>
<p>Traders said Wednesday's rebound in the stock market was widely considered as temporary and failed to dampen JGBs.</p>
<p>&quot;It seems a bit mysterious that JGBs were not sold despite today's rebound in stocks. But that was because nobody believes the stock market's downtrend is over,&quot; said a senior dealer at a major securities house.</p>
<p>A downtrend in the stock market since late last year has been supporting the bond market's view that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) needs to maintain its low interest rate policy.  </p>
<p>The benchmark Nikkei stock average surged by nearly four percent at the close, boosted by media reports that the government may scrap taxes on securities transactions.</p>
<p>The index was up 655.72 points or 3.78 percent at 18,013.88, clearing the psychologically important 18,000 level.</p>
<p>Cash bonds were hardly affected by BOJ Governor Yasuo Matsushita's comments on the economy, which came after futures trading ended. The comments were little changed from those made at the opening of the BOJ branch managers' meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>The yield of key 182nd 10-year JGBs stood at 2.395 percent at 0708 GMT, down 0.025 from Tuesday's finish.  </p>
<p>Matsushita said Japan's economy was still recovering gradually and the recovery was becoming firmer.</p>
<p>He added: &quot;Our monetary policy for now, as I have said before, is to put emphasis on securing the basis for economic recovery while keeping careful watch on economic developments.&quot;</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, large-lot selling was detected in the futures market soon after the BOJ conducted an outright bond purchase operation at 0110 GMT as expected, traders said.</p>
<p>The purchase volume was 100 billion yen, unchanged from the previous operation announced January 8. The BOJ has halved the amount to 100 billion yen in each operation since December 24.</p>
