<headline>Shanghai B shares end up on window-dressing trade.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1996-09-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shanghai's B share index closed up on Friday, reversing early losses on institutional window-dressing buying late in the session, but market sentiment remained weak ahead of a National Day holiday, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index gained 0.241 points or 0.50 percent to 48.903 points, on volume of 7.7 million shares worth $2.5 million. Of 41 B shares, 31 traded, with 12 up, nine flat and 10 down.</p>
<p>Brokers said that late window-dressing buying caused today's rise, but sentiment was poor and trading sluggish.  </p>
<p>&quot;Most investors are in a holiday mood, with no interest in buying shares, and liquidation selling from overseas will depress the market,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>China's National Day holiday will last from September 28 to October 2. Trading will resume on October 3.</p>
<p>A second broker said it would be difficult to change the bearish tone after the holiday unless there was positive news, since overseas investors were likely to withdraw their capital from the market.  </p>
<p>Shanghai Post and Telecommunications Equipment was the star on a technical rebound after falling in the past weeks, helped by a single order ahead of the close, brokers said. It jumped $0.048 or 12.63 percent to $0.428, on volume of 107,500 shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai Narcissus Electric Appliance was the biggest loser amid poor results because of a soft domestic electric appliance market, brokers said. It fell $0.008 or 5.79 percent to $0.130, on volume of 961,700 shares, the biggest trading volume.</p>
<p>Shanghai's A share index rose on rumours the Shanghai city government would give some listed firms preferential policy, brokers said. Officials declined to comment.  </p>
<p>The index ended up 22.326 points or 2.49 percent to 918.946 points, on volume of 651.2 million shares worth 6.6 billion yuan.</p>
<p>The SSE 30 rose 68.271 points or 2.85 percent to 2462.463 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai Hero was the star on institutional speculative buying, surging 3.78 yuan or 22.49 percent to 20.58 yuan, on volume of 4.8 million shares.</p>
