<p>Wall Street stocks were expected to open mixed to slightly higher Thursday, with bargain-hunters stepping in after a volatile session yesterday that saw share prices finish lower.</p>
<p>While the broader market may rise, the technology sector could come under pressure after several earnings warnings, analysts said.</p>
<p>A big swing in initial jobless claims could also derail the bond and stock markets, they said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Unless we have a wild claims number, we should see some bargain-unting and the market could open a little higher,&quot; said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker.</p>
<p>In early trade, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 futures index was up 1.45 points at 897.70, while the long bond was unchanged at a 6.74 percent yield.</p>
<p>Stocks slumped yesterday amid a sell-off in bonds and concerns that higher oil prices might fuel inflation. The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished down 68.08 points at 7689.98.  </p>
<p>Bonds, which declined yesterday after a Treasury auction and comments by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, will take their early direction from initial jobless claims, due at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT, analysts said.</p>
<p>Claims are forecast to fall by 7,000, to 340,000, for the week ended June 21.</p>
<p>Stocks were expected to keep a wary eye on bonds while digesting earnings warnings in the technology sector.</p>
<p>Komag Inc said Wednesday that results for its second quarter and the rest of the fiscal year would fall short of forecasts due to weak demand for its disk drives.  </p>
<p>Atmel Corp also said its second quarter results would fall short of estimates. It cited pricing pressures in its non-volatile memory business due to increased competition.</p>
<p>&quot;There could be some pressure in the technology sector,&quot; said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments. He forecast more choppiness for tobacco stocks.</p>
<p>Analysts said oil prices, whose rise spooked stocks yesterday, would not be much of a factor today.</p>
<p>The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ended Vienna talks on Thursday by retaining its production limits.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't think it will have much impact on markets,&quot; Cardillo said. &quot;There is so much cheating on OPEC quotas.&quot;</p>
<p>Japan's Nikkei average closed off 54.51 points at 20,624.76.</p>
<p>In London the FTSE 100 was up 17.5 points at 4657.5.</p>
<p>The dollar pared gains against the yen on profit-taking, trading at 113.81/91 yen in Tokyo. In Europe the dollar traded at 1.7260/70 marks, rangebound after Germany's central bank, the Bundesbank, left interest rates unchanged.  </p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal said in its Heard on the Street column that Westinghouse Electric Corp's director and senior executive Mel Karmazin has scored points since taking control of the company's CBS TV station group.</p>
<p>The New York Times said in its Market Place column that relatively good quarterly results from Morgan Stanley, Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co were a sign of strength on Wall Street.</p>
