<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss franc firms versus mark on SNB comment.</title>
<headline>Swiss franc firms versus mark on SNB comment.</headline>
<text>
<p>0650 GMT - The Swiss franc opened narrowly mixed against the dollar and mark but firmed against the German unit in early trade on Swiss National Bank Chairman Hans Meyer's reported comment the central bank did not conduct exchange rate policy.</p>
<p>His remark to a Swiss newspaper reiterated SNB policy, but signalled the SNB did not intend to drive the franc lower against the mark, one dealer at a big Swiss bank said.</p>
<p>&quot;Certainly what he said won't make people jump on the mark against the franc, more the reverse,&quot; this dealer said.  </p>
<p>* Dollar opens at 1.4650/4660 francs, down from yesterday's close at 1.4683/4688</p>
<p>* Mark starts at 85.02/05 Swiss centimes, up from 84.95/97, but slips under 85 centimes in early business</p>
<p>* Three-month Eurofrancs quoted at 1.50/1.75 percent</p>
<p>&quot;Some people outside Switzerland thought the SNB would do its utmost to push the franc lower,&quot; one dealer said, noting those short francs were eager to see how the SNB would react to the mark's retreat from February highs at 87.77 centimes.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not the story that will prompt a big move, but it could help the mark firm a bit,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Other investors who have been long dollars are slowly getting tired of waiting for the U.S. unit to stop lagging against the franc, he added.</p>
<p>&quot;For dollar/Swiss, the risk is on the downside,&quot; he added.</p>
