<p>CBOT corn futures closed higher on impressive gains in soybeans, on spillover support from Friday's cut by USDA in its estimate for 1996-97 U.S. corn ending stocks, and on cold weather, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;Cold weather here and hot and dry in southern Brazil plus followthrough from Friday and that's all it takes,&quot; said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>USDA Friday pegged 1996-97 U.S. corn carryover at 959 million bushels, below the previous forecast by the government at 1.157 billion bushels. USDA also said Friday that 1996 U.S. corn production totaled 9.293 billion bushels,  below average expectations for 9.317 billion.</p>
<p>Cold weather and input from the export sector contributed to the advances.</p>
<p>Bitter cold temperatures in the U.S. was increasing livestock feeding rates, the traders said.</p>
<p>Also USDA Monday said 37.967 million bushels of corn were inspected for export during the week ended January 9, above expectations for 25 million to 30 million bushels.</p>
<p>Corn closed 1-3/4 cents per bushel higher to 3/4 lower, with March up 1-3/4 at $2.67-1/4.  </p>
<p>Cargill Inc bought three million bushels of March, FIMAT Futures bought three million bushels of May, Tenco Inc bought 2.5 million March and Lehman Bros bought two million bushels of March, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 85,000 contracts, below the 101,885 contracts traded Friday.</p>
<p>In corn options, Smith Barney bought 400 March $2.50 puts at one to 1-1/8 cents, FIMAT Futures sold 600 May $2.70 puts at 10-1/4 to 10-3/4 cents and LFG Futures bought 500 May $3.00 calls at 2-1/4 cents, traders said. Produce Grain bought 600 May $2.50 puts and sold 600 March $2.50 puts, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 25,000 contracts, about the same as the 24,996 contracts traded Friday.</p>
