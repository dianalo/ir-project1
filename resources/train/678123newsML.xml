<headline>UK export demand picks up in June - CBI survey.</headline>

<p>UK export demand began to pick up in June, but only slightly, with the strong pound dampening the recovery, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Friday.</p>
<p>But while shackling export growth, the strength of sterling was helping to subdue any increases in goods' prices, in turn warding off any near-term inflationary worries, the report said.</p>
<p>&quot;Currency appreciation is helping to hold down price rises of manufactured products, suggesting that short-term prospects for price inflation remain highly promising,&quot; said Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economics.</p>
<p>The CBI report said that while overseas demand for UK manufactured goods still remained weak, fewer manufacturers were reporting lower-than-normal export orders.</p>
<p>The latest CBI monthly trends survey, covering the end of May and June, showed that 24 percent of firms consider their total order books to be below normal, while 21 percent said they were above normal, leaving a negative balance of three percent compared with negative balances of eight percent in May and seven percent in April.</p>
<p>A negative balance of 20 percent of manufacturers reported below normal export order books, compared with 24 percent in May and 23 percent in April.</p>
<p>Stocks of finished goods in June reached the highest levels seen since May 1996, the report said.</p>
<p>A positive balance of 21 percent of companies said their stocks were more than adequate to meet expected demand. This compares to a positive balance of 14 percent in May and 17 percent in April.</p>
<p>But UK manufacturers have eased their output growth expectations to the lowest levels since last June.</p>
<p>June's positive balance of 13 percent is down of May's figure of 17 percent.</p>
<p>Price expectations had sunk to their lowest levels since last July. Manufacturers expect prices to remain broadly unchanged over the next four months. The negative balance of one percent compares with positive balances of four percent in May and six percent last June. --Simon Gardner + 44 171 542 2774</p>
