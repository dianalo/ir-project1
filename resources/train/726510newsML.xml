<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/Expiration week starts off slow.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-07-14</dateline>

<p>The July expiration week got off to a slow start Monday, but traders said a late-session move could once again enliven the market.</p>
<p>&quot;It's kind of slow, but volatility's high,&quot; said one trader in the S&amp;P 500 index .SPX options pit.</p>
<p>&quot;We'll probably get our 12 to 15 point move in today,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't know which way, but we'll get it.&quot;</p>
<p>Sharp market moves in the last hour of trading are nothing new, but traders said the regularity of such moves is new.</p>
<p>July options expire at the end of the week.  </p>
<p>By about 1140 CDT/1640 GMT, the SPX was up 4.11 at 920.79, off the 921.78 session high but above its 916.68 low. September S&amp;P 500 futures were up 3.25 at 927.65.</p>
<p>Among other major indexes, the Dow industrial average .DJI gained nearly 20 points to 7,941 and the S&amp;P 100 .OEX added 5.64 to 899.23.</p>
<p>Traders said volatility in July index options would likely remain high for the beginning of the week but would drop sharply into the expiration.</p>
<p>The volatility index .VIX, which is priced off certain front-month OEX contracts, was up 0.40 at 22.43 Monday.  </p>
<p>One index option trader said late-session moves were not uncommon but their increased regularity was helping to keep volatilities pumped up.</p>
<p>Options analysts said early indications showed solid underlying strength for the market heading into this week's expiration.</p>
<p>Jerry Hegarty, an analyst at Thomson Financial Services, said through the 14 trading days of the July expiration cycle, nearly 400,000 index puts have traded compared to calls.</p>
<p>&quot;This accumulation should help push stock prices higher this week,&quot; he said in a report.  </p>
<p>But if index options activity was suggesting investor caution, other sentiment measures were still showing high bullishness.</p>
<p>&quot;Wall Street is wildly bullish,&quot; Chris Cadbury said in his daily market letter. He noted that last week, three sentiment surveys all showed investor bullishness at 70 percent or higher for the first time ever.</p>
<p>He forecast the SPX to end the week at 916 or lower.</p>
