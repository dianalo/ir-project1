<p>Hewlett-Packard Co's surprisingly sluggish order and revenue growth in its second quarter will force investors to weigh whether and when recent rapid growth can resume, analysts said.</p>
<p>Complicating the matter is the variety of factors in the slowdown, which affected a number of the company's computer lines as well as printers and involved product transitions, competition and currency rates as well.</p>
<p>&quot;There's no area that is totally free of some kind of a problem,&quot; one analyst said after listening to a thorough two-hour long conference call with HP executives.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard shares had strengthened in recent sessions on anticipation of a positive earnings report, with shares gaining 2-1/4 to close at 58-7/8 in New York consolidated trading before the earnings release.</p>
<p>HP shares were halted at the market close, but analysts said they would expect the share to shed at least five points at the outset and could hit the low 50s.</p>
<p>Some analysts appeared to be broadsided by the disappointing earnings result, remarking it could take more than a quarter for the company to turn around underperforming businesses. &quot;I expect it to take shorter than nine months, but probably more than three,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Some analysts expressed concern, for example, that the lackluster growth in printers, including a slight decline in orders and revenue of HP LaserJet printers, could be evidence the sector is maturing.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm puzzled. I've never seen anything like this,&quot; proclaimed another analyst during the conference call, referring to the evidence that printer growth was well below that of personal computers for the industry.</p>
<p>HP executives said in the conference call printers were one of several areas where it will be introducing more aggressive products in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>&quot;I think we've had a hiccup here,&quot; one of the HP executives said of the weak sales and orders for printers.</p>
<p>The company also plans to unveil speedy new high end Unix servers next week, which could help it counter recent launches of high-performance, competing machines from companies like Sun Microsystems Inc and Silicon Graphics Inc and Digital Equipment Corp</p>
<p>At one point, HP executives appeared a bit exasperated by the heavy concerns of analysts despite the difficult comparison from the year-ago period when business was booming and revenues grew by 33 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Don't forget the comparison we're talking about here. That has a big affect on things,&quot; one HP executive told analysts in the conference call. &quot;Yeah, there's been some slowing, but is the sky falling? Absolutely not.&quot;</p>
<p>HP CFO Robert Wayman told analysts the company must continue to work on controlling costs.</p>
<p>&quot;HP has seen slowdowns like this in the past, and certainly we have said for some time that we could not sustain 20 percent growth indefinitely,&quot; said Wayman.</p>
<p>Other HP executives said the company continues to target growth in the high teens to 20 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;There is a maturing business in the printer business and how do they react to that in order to keep the top line growth on a perennial 15 to 20 percent clip (for the whole company),&quot; said JP Morgan analyst Daniel Kunstler.</p>
<p>Still, it is not as if HP, which is the second largest U.S.-based maker of computing equipment, is powerless to bring changes in its markets - it supplies more than two out of three printers in many markets, for example.</p>
<p>&quot;A lot of (the solution) is going to have to do with the fact that their market presence is so powerful that as they introduce new markets they can create the market, they can spur the market on,&quot; said Kunstler. (sam.perry@reuters.com, Palo Alto Bureau 415 846 5400)</p>
