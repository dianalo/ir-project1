<p>Over the past 25 years American women gained ground in the workplace -- with more female managers and a narrower pay gap with men -- but overall parity between the sexes is elusive, a new study reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Population Reference Bureau, a private, non-profit group, reported that despite advances in the workplace and growing political clout as demonstrated by the outcome of the 1996 presidential election -- when President Bill Clinton's victory was widely attributed to women voters -- women lagged socially and economically in key areas.</p>
<p>While labour force participation was up for women, the study found that women in the mid-1990s were earning on average only 72 percent of what men did. This was an increase from the 59 percent of men's earnings that women made in 1970.</p>
<p>The proportion of women managers jumped to 43 percent in the mid-1990s, compared with 19 percent in the 1970s, according to the study, and by 1993, women earned 54 percent of all college degrees.</p>
<p>But women retained primary responsibility for housework and child care, the study said, citing figures that showed married mothers performed about two-thirds of housework in the mid-1980s, compared with the 85 percent they did in 1965.</p>
<p>&quot;Recent studies suggest that men have not increased the hours they spend doing domestic chores over the past decade,&quot; the study's authors said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;The increase in men's share of housework reflects the fact that women have begun doing less housework rather than men picking up the slack.&quot;</p>
<p>Divorce hits women harder than men, the study said, with women's household income dropping by 24 percent after divorce, while men's declined by 6 percent.</p>
<p>Women's chances of living in poverty remain higher than men's, especially in the case of the elderly, with older women twice as likely to live in poverty than men their age.</p>
<p>The study's authors, Suzanne Bianchi and Daphne Spain, said in the statement the movement toward greater equality between men and women in work and family roles would come about through generational change.</p>
