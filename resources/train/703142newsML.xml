<p>The Justice Department's public integrity section is about to recommend against seeking an independent counsel to investigate CIA-Director-designate George Tenet's failure to disclose stock and real estate holding, the Washington Post reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The newspaper quoted officials familiar with the department's two-month inquiry into Tenet's holdings as saying the report would be released &quot;shortly.&quot;</p>
<p>At issue are telephone stock and condominium apartments in Greece that Tenet inherited from his father, who died in 1983, but that Tenet did not list on his initial financial disclosure forms when he joined the Clinton administration in 1993.</p>
<p>Tenet said he did not learn about the stock and the Athens property until 1994, when his brother discovered their existence after looking through a family safe deposit box.</p>
<p>The dividends from the stock went directly to Tenet's mother and the income from the apartment accumulated in Greece, according to the newspaper report.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the White House decided the initial failure to disclose was a technical violation and automatically triggered the provision of the act, requiring an investigation of up to 90 days before Attorney General Janet Reno could make a determination that an independent counsel was not required.</p>
<p>The FBI and Justice Department attorneys have spent hours interviewing members of Tenet's family and going over documents -- including Greek law -- to try to cover every possible element in the case.</p>
