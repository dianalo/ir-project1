<p>Germany took another firm step on Thursday towards sending hundreds of thousands of civil war refugees home to the Balkans when it signed a repatriation agreement with rump Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Manfred Kanther and Vukasin Jokanovic, Belgrade's interior minister, said at a news conference in Bonn that some 135,000 refugees from Yugoslavia would be sent home starting in December.</p>
<p>The agreement came a day after the conservative south German state of Bavaria deported the first of some 320,000 Bosnian civil war refugees in Germany. Several other German states are ignoring criticism from humanitarian groups and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and planning to start repatriating refugees this year.</p>
<p>The man expelled by Bavaria late on Wednesday was a Bosnian refugee convicted of sexual violations. The state government vowed to deport other lawbreakers who do not leave voluntarily.</p>
<p>Most of the Yugoslav refugees in Germany are from the mainly Albanian-populated province of Kosovo. Kosovo's 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority has boycotted Serbian authority since Belgrade clamped down on the province in 1989.</p>
<p>In Bonn, several hundred Kosovo Albanian refugees demonstrated outside the Interior Ministry, holding posters that read: &quot;Don't sent us back to the torturers!&quot; and &quot;The deportation of Kosovo Albanians will provoke a new Balkan war&quot;.</p>
<p>Kanther said the refugees would be repatriated within three years, and the agreement would send a signal to anyone contemplating coming to Germany. About 2,500 refugees from rump Yugoslavia are still arriving in Germany each month.</p>
<p>&quot;This agreement underscores the fact that Germany is not a land for immigrants,&quot; Kanther said.</p>
<p>&quot;Germany is prepared to help out during the turmoil of war or other special circumstances when needed, but it also expects foreigners to leave our country again when they can live legally, safely and with dignity in their own land.&quot;</p>
<p>Jokanovic, the first Yugoslav minister to visit Bonn since the Balkan war ended, said Belgrade was counting on German help in the recovery of the Yugoslav economy. But he and Kanther both insisted there were no strings attached to the agreement.</p>
<p>&quot;Yugoslavia does not negotiate a price to take its own people back,&quot; said Jokanovic.</p>
<p>He added that there would nevertheless be economic and social difficulties in reintegrating the refugees from Germany to a region he called &quot;backward and underdeveloped&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;There was no price for this agreement,&quot; Kanther said. &quot;It is a fundamental part of international law that nations take back their own people.&quot;</p>
<p>Germany took in some 320,000 refugees from the 3 1/2-year Bosnian war, more than the rest of the European Union together.</p>
<p>States such as Bavaria and Berlin, whose budgets have been hit by costly support payments, have taken a hard line and are starting to send refugees home this month, despite calls to wait until after the winter.</p>
<p>Berlin said it not so far deported anyone but several Bosnian criminals or those who had come to Germany in the last year could be expelled before the end of the month.</p>
