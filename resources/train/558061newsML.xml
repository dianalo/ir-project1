<p>An informal session of Zaire's parliament on Saturday called for the return of Roman Catholic Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo as speaker, the constitutional successor to beleaguered President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>&quot;We are asking him to come back so that in the case of negotiations or of a military victory by the rebels the democratic process hoped for by the Zairean people can be safeguarded,&quot; said Christophe Lutundula, one of parliament's deputy speakers.</p>
<p>Rebels fighting to end Mobutu's three-decade rule have seized three-quarters of Zaire and reached within 150 km (95 miles) of the capital. The 66-year-old president is also battling with prostate cancer.</p>
<p>According to Zaire's transitional constitution the speaker of parliament succeeds the president in the interim, in the event of his death or incapacity.</p>
<p>Saturday's vote was unanimous among the 320 deputies present in parliament, who requested a full session of the 738-member body early next week to confirm the vote.</p>
<p>On Wednesday parliament rejected a move by political leaders to place a Mobutu ally in the key position.</p>
<p>The post has been vacant since 1995, when Monsengwo was ousted by a coalition of politicians from the opposition and presidential movements.</p>
<p>Monsengwo, archbishop of the eastern city of Kisangani, is a widely respected figure in the largely Roman Catholic nation.</p>
<p>He played an important role as a political mediator in the turbulent politics of the early 1990s after Mobutu, under heavy foreign pressure, announced a programme supposed to lead to democratic elections.</p>
<p>Mobutu was in the Congolese port of Pointe Noire on Saturday, waiting for rebel leader Laurent Kabila to arrive from the Angolan capital Luanda for peace talks presided over by President Nelson Mandela aboard a South African naval ship.</p>
