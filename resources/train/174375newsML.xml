<p>Queensland pace bowler Andrew Bichel took six for 63 on Thursday to spark a dramatic collapse by the Tasmanian batsmen on the second day of their Sheffield Shield match.</p>
<p>Tasmania took their overnight total of 14 to one to 121 without further loss before Bichel swung into action.</p>
<p>David Boon's side then lost their last nine wickets for 47 and were eventually dismissed for an inadequate 168.</p>
<p>Michael DiVenuto was the best of Tasmania's batsmen, scoring 66 before he fell to swing bowler Adam Dale who took three for 29 in his maiden first-class appearance.</p>
<p>At the close Queensland were 206 for nine in reply with Geoff Foley unbeaten on 62.</p>
<p>Queensland started their innings hesitantly and were 97 for four before Foley came to the crease and steadied the innings.</p>
