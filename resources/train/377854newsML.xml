<p>Strong underlying profit growth by British pharmaceutical group Medeva Plc will be masked by one-off acquisition charges, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The company is expected to announce on Wednesday a rise in full-year pre-tax profit before exceptional items to between 99 and 103 million stg from 79.0 million in 1995.</p>
<p>However a charge of around 65 million stg linked to the acquisition of the U.S. assets of Rhone Poulenc Rorer Inc will make the headline figure rather less impressive.  </p>
<p>The dividend is expected to be raised to between 4.5 and 5.8 pence from 4.0 pence a year before.</p>
<p>Behaviour-controlling drug Methylphenidate will again be the main engine of profitability. However Medeva's dominant position in the highly-controlled U.S. market for the drug, which is used mainly on children and young adults, is likely to be squeezed over the next two years as new competition comes on stream.</p>
<p>Analysts at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said the acquistion of the former U.S. operations of Fisons, acquired by RPR in 1995, would give Medeva a platform to build on its acquisition of late-stage drugs.  </p>
<p>&quot;The deal secured both modern and efficient manufacturing capacity in excess of current requirements, and the opportunity for U.S. rationalisation with associated cost savings,&quot; SocGen said in a recent note.</p>
<p>The company's strategy of acquiring late-stage development products to sell received a boost last month with positive test results from Hepagene, a vaccination and potential therapy for hepatitis B.</p>
