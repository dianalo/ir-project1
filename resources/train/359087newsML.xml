<p>An underground tunnel carrying palletised air freight is to move off the drawing board to a detailed design phase if 12 million guilders in funding can be secured from the Dutch government.</p>
<p>Thys Stoffer, head of communications at the leading Dutch flower auction Bloemenveilling Aalsmeer told Reuters that a preliminary study had proven the technical feasibility of the so-called Underground Logistic System (ULS).</p>
<p>The system is being proposed to link the flower auction with Schiphol airport and the national rail network at the Dutch town of Hoofddorp.</p>
<p>In a telephone interview Stoffer said the various parties working on the feasibility study had come to see the project as a piece of infrastructure which &quot;like a motorway or railway, requires state support.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We look at this system as an underground motorway and we know that there's increasing interest from the Government, not just the Ministry of Economic Affairs, but from the Transport and Agriculture Ministries and from the Ministry of Education, which views this as exportable technology.&quot;</p>
<p>The preliminary research suggested that a 25-kilometre long tube with a diameter of five metres would cost one billion guilders to build. A cheaper option would carry 3.5 metre wide pallets of freight at speeds of between 20 and 40 kilometres an hour between the auction, airport and railway station, and would cost 550 million guilders.</p>
<p>A total of nine loading and unloading stations were suggested - four at Schiphol, three at the auction and three at the Hoofddorp rail terminal. Dutch newspapers have nick-named the system the 'freight metro.'</p>
<p>The initial study was carried out on behalf of the airport operating company Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, the freight wing of Dutch state railway company, NS Cargo, the flower auction, the airfreight trade body ATAN, the freight promotion body Nederland Distributieland and the Dutch research body Centre for Transport Technology. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax:5017</p>
