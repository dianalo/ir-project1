<p>British Airways Plc was bracing itself on Wednesday for the result of a strike ballot of 10,000 of its cabin crew as union leaders predicted overwhelming support in favour of industrial action over an annual pay deal dispute.</p>
<p>A BA spokesman told Reuters before the 1000 GMT ballot result announcement &quot;We have not heard about any results from the union so far. We've heard the speculation and if that is true, it is disappointing but not surprising.&quot;</p>
<p>The result of a ballot by the British Airlines Stewards and Stewardesses Association (BASSA), part of the T&amp;G union, is expected to show &quot;overwhelming backing&quot; for industrial action, said T&amp;G general secretary Bill Morris on BBC radio this morning.</p>
<p>That statement put pressure on the airline's shares, which were down five and a half pence at 695 at 0930 GMT.</p>
<p>The BA spokesman said if the vote favoured industrial action, &quot;We would be forced to put contingency plans into place.&quot; He refused to comment on those plans further.</p>
<p>The deal is understood to have been accepted by 3,000 thousand cabin staff, said BA. But if staff decide to strike, BA would need to be given seven days notice ahead of any action, which would need to be taken within 24 days of the vote being held, said the airline spokesman.</p>
<p>The pay deal comprises a basic wage rise of between 14.2 percent and 24 percent, with higher pensionable salaries and better profit sharing terms, sickness and maternity leave benefits.</p>
<p>BA chief executive Bob Ayling wrote to staff this week offering to guarantee that no-one would be worse off under the new deal. A three year money-back guarantee was offered as security on this promise, said Ayling.</p>
<p>Talks between the two sides broke down after five months of discussions over how to restructure pay.</p>
