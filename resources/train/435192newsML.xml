<p>Galileo Corp said Wednesday it expects to record a charge for the three months ended March 31, 1997 of $6.8 million, or at least $1.00 per share, as a result of a reorganization.</p>
<p>The reorganization, as well as redeployment of its resources, have been adopted as a result of the recent loss of its largest customer, Xerox Corp, it said.  </p>
<p>The company previously disclosed that the loss of Xerox will have a material adverse impact on its financial performance for at least the remainder of fiscal 1997 and will likely result in operating losses for the year.</p>
<p>Galileo said the bulk of the charge will be non-cash and relates to reductions in inventory, plant and equipment and other assets.</p>
<p>The charge also includes provisions for severance and other obligations offset by a credit due to the curtailment of related pension benefits, it said.  </p>
<p>Galileo said it has reduced its work force by 39 employees, or 16 percent of the total, resulting in an annualized savings of $1.3 million.</p>
<p>In addition, certain significant discretionary expenditures, originally planned to support higher operating levels, have been either postponed or eliminated, it said.</p>
<p>William  Hanley, president and chief executive officer, said the company believes it has taken appropropriate steps to respond to the loss of the Xerox business.</p>
<p>&quot;From the anticipated growth in our medical products group and the continued health of our scientific detector products group we believe that we will return to profitability in the first calendar quarter of 1998,&quot; he said.</p>
