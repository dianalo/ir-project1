<title>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Kenmare denies BHP takeover interest.</title>
<headline>Kenmare denies BHP takeover interest.</headline>

<p>Irish exploration company Kenmare Resources Plc on Tuesday denied market rumours that its joint venture partner BHP was going to make a bid for Kenmare.</p>
<p>&quot;As far as we are aware no approach has been made to us by BHP, nor are we aware of any intention by them to make an approach,&quot; company secretary Tony McCluskey told Reuters.</p>
<p>McCluskey said he had spoken with the Irish stock exchange on the matter and he said he had given it a similar response in that, as far as Kenmare was aware, no bid was being prepared, had been prepared or had been entered into on behalf of BHP for Kenmare.</p>
<p>Kenmare and BHP entered into a joint venture in July 1996 covering exploration and possible development of the Congolone Mineral Sands Project in northern Mozambique.</p>
<p>At the time of the announcement an estimated resource of 50.5 million tonnes of ilmenite was identified.</p>
<p>&quot;We are in a very significant joint venture with BHP and that is the extent of our involvement with BHP. It is probably not fully understood by the market as it is a relatively complex area,&quot; McCluskey said.</p>
<p>The joint venture agreement entitles BHP to earn a 75 percent interest in the project by spending $24 million. However, BHP's participation was contingent on the continued success of the exploration programme.</p>
<p>&quot;To build that project you are probably talking in the order of $300 million plus and since the announcement we have made very good progress with BHP,&quot; McCluskey said.</p>
<p>&quot;They (BHP) have continued to advance their involvement and to advance their drilling programmes and as far as I am aware they are planning another drilling programme for 1997,&quot; McCluskey said.</p>
