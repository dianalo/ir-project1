<p>Technology giant Motorola Inc., still battling the downturn in its key semiconductor business, on Monday reported earnings of $325 million, lower than last year but beating analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>Motorola said its earnings, equivalent to 53 cents a share, came on sales of $6.6 billion and included gains from the sale of an investment and favorable patent settlements. In the first quarter of 1996, Motorola earned $384 million, or 63 cents a share, on sales of $7.0 billion.</p>
<p>The company said the gains accounted for less than 10 percent of pre-tax profits, and analysts estimated that excluding the gains Motorola earned at least 48 cents a share.</p>
<p>Market analysts had predicted Motorola would earn 45 cents a share, according to estimates compiled by First Call.</p>
<p>The results also met analysts' expectations that the profit would exceed that of the fourth quarter of last year, when it earned $238 million, or 39 cents a share. But analysts said revenues were shy of expectations, which ranged from about $6.8 billion to $7.2 billion.</p>
<p>&quot;The bottom line is these are pretty good numbers,&quot; said Mona Eraiba, an analyst for Gruntal &amp; Co. &quot;The margins are improving, they're bringing costs down and it's an improving trend. But revenue is the question mark right now.&quot;</p>
<p>Motorola said the decline in sales for the quarter reflected a 16 percent drop in sales of semiconductor products, and orders were off 5 percent. But the company said the segment returned to profitability from an operating loss in the fourth quarter of 1996, although the profits were lower than a year ago.</p>
<p>&quot;While semiconductor sales and orders were lower than first quarter 1996 levels, orders improved from fourth quarter 1996, as the business emerged from last year's semiconductor industry recession,&quot; Robert Growney, Motorola president, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company said its steps to reduce costs in several business segments were beginning to have a favorable impact.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the bottom line is they were able to reduce their costs,&quot; said Chris Chaney, an analyst for A.G. Edwards. &quot;Gross margin was up a couple of points and we didn't expect that.&quot;</p>
<p>Motorola said sales in its cellular products segment, recently hit by pricing pressure and stiff competition, increased by 4 percent and new orders increased by 3 percent. But sales in the messaging information and media segment, which includes the paging group, fell 7 percent, orders were up just 1 percent and operating profits were lower.</p>
