<p>Czech shares continued to rally with both the RPIX and PX50 indices gaining nearly 0.8 percent each, driven with equal force by major and less heavily capitalised issues.</p>
<p>Power utility CEZ was one of the PX50 index's biggest gainers among the major issues rising 11 crowns, 1.2 percent, to 961. Despite the gains, CEZ has lost nearly 26 percent from its 12 month high of 1,310 which it reached in late summer.</p>
<p>Most analysts said that despite better than expected nine month financial results, published in November, there was little likeleood of a rebound in CEZ's fortunes on the bourse.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that the fair value of the stock is between CZK 900 and CZK 1,000...we see little short-term upside potential,&quot; a report to investors from Patria Finance investment bank said.</p>
<p>All other major issues moved higher.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, computer systems company PVT continued to post strong gains despite a surprisingly sharp fall in its nine month unconsolidated pre-tax profits of 92 percent to 52 million crowns.</p>
<p>Since November 13, PVT's share price has risen 457 crowns or 15.6 percent. On Tuesday the issue was up 161 crowns to 3,391.</p>
