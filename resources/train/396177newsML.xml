<title>ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA: Antiguan government investigates six banks.</title>

<p>Antiguan government officials said on Friday they were investigating six offshore banks with Russian and Ukrainian links that U.S. officials claimed were being run as money laundering operations.</p>
<p>&quot;It became apparent that the offshore banking act was a very weak one,&quot; said Wrenford Ferrance, special adviser on drugs and money laundering policy to Antigua's prime minister, Lester Bird.</p>
<p>&quot;There were a lot of loopholes and these banks were pretty unregulated,&quot; Ferrance told a news conference at the bi-annual summit of the Caribbean Community Heads of Government.</p>
<p>He said the prime minister, after prodding by Washington, ordered an investigation a year ago into Antigua's banking system. The investigation concluded that relatively few of the island's offshore banks could be regarded as legitimate.</p>
<p>Ferrance said the government had identified six of 59 offshore banks registered in Antigua as having Russian or Ukrainian links.</p>
<p>Ferrance said the island's offshore bank inspectorate was preparing to shut down five of six of those banks &quot;due to irregularities in their operations.&quot;  He did not indicate which banks were being forced to close on the island.</p>
<p>He said the government also declared a moratorium on new offshore bank applications until a new, stricter law could be tabled in parliament later this year.</p>
<p>Antigua first marketed itself as an offshore banking center in 1983, hoping to diversify its economy, which is heavily dependent on tourism.</p>
<p>According to the finance ministry, fees paid by offshore banks last year totaled $1.6 million, far less than the $30 million to $40 million Bird says the sector is capable of producing.</p>
<p>&quot;We've gotten a bum rap,&quot; Bird told reporters, referring to the island's reputation for being a haven for dirty money, pointing to the fact that the majority of Antigua's offshore institutions were owned and operated by Americans.</p>
<p>Bird said Antigua had asked the British government to send a permanent representative to Antigua to help monitor the island's banking sector.</p>
<p>Ferrance said that since the early 1990s, a growing number of offshore banks had been registered in Antigua. Recently, U.S. and British officials urged Antiguan authorities to tighten up the system, alleging the so-called Russian mafia was laundering hundreds of millions of dollars through its offshore banks there.</p>
