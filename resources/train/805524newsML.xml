<p>Cambodian government forces on Monday advanced to within one kilometre (half a mile) of the last town held by loyalists of ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, military officials said.</p>
<p>But Khmer Rouge rebels, who had come to reinforce the royalist positions at the town of O'Smach, said they had pushed government forces back to Phong, a town 12 km (seven miles) south of O'Smach.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge also said they had destroyed a government artillery base and had killed 70 soldiers in a nearby town, Krong Kriel, about 25 km (15 miles) south of O'Smach. They said only three rebels had died.</p>
<p>But General Meas Sophea, chief of fighting operations, denied the Khmer Rouge's reports of their advance and government casualties and said his army was only one km from O'Smach.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to take it today,&quot; he told Reuters, adding that dense forest, a proliferation of landmines and booby traps and malaria in the area had slowed the government's advance toward the northwest town near the Thai border.</p>
<p>The general said about 600 Khmer Rouge troops were fighting alongside Ranariddh's forces.</p>
<p>The area around O'Smach was quiet on Monday after forces loyal to Second Prime Minister Hun Sen pounded the town with mortar and artillery fire at the weekend.</p>
<p>Dozens of artillery and mortar shells landed four to five km (three miles) from the centre of town and two shells landed on Thai soil over the weekend.</p>
<p>Ranariddh's rag-tag forces have been fighting the government in the northwest since the prince was overthrown by Hun Sen in Phnom Penh on July 6.</p>
<p>The Khmer Rouge on their clandestine radio on Monday appealed to opposition forces to press the fight against Hun Sen.</p>
<p>Major Yen Bunsrun of Ranariddh's army said his forces were fighting with help from more than 1,000 soldiers of the Khmer Rouge, Maoists who ruled Cambodia during the 1975-79 &quot;Killing Fields&quot; years.</p>
<p>&quot;The Khmer Rouge are responsible for the front-line fighting, laying landmines and blowing up a bridge,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Ranariddh's forces control a small strip of territory along the Thai border leading to the Khmer Rouge base of Anlong Veng, about 50 km (30 miles) east of O'Smach, Cambodian army officials said.</p>
<p>Yen Bunsrun said the Khmer Rouge had joined the royalist fighters out of fear that if O'Smach fell, government troops would then press into Anlong Veng.</p>
<p>Hun Sen and Ranariddh formed an uneasy coalition after 1993 elections sponsored by the United Nations. The Khmer Rouge was a party to the 1991 pact that led to the polls but reneged on the deal and waged a low-intensity guerrilla war against Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>Ranariddh had been negotiating a peace deal with the guerrillas for several months and was reported to have reached an agreement just before Hun Sen's power grab.</p>
<p>The fighting has pushed thousands of fleeing civilians to the Thai border, and the Thai army has been moved to full alert in case the fighting spilled across the border.</p>
<p>Major General Jeerasak Promakorn, commander of the border task force in Thailand, said he thought the royalists could hold out for some time.</p>
<p>He said the Thai army was allowing international relief agencies to cross the border up to 200 metres into Cambodia to assist displaced persons.</p>
<p>Cambodians might be allowed to cross the border if fighting worsened, he said.</p>
