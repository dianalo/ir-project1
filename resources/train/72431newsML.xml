<p>Russia's opposition communists stepped up pressure on Boris Yeltsin over his heart problems on Tuesday, but the Kremlin hit back by saying there was no question of the president stepping down.</p>
<p>Gennady Seleznyov, the communist chairman of the lower house of parliament, called for more openness on Yeltsin's health and said doctors should release full details when they meet on Wednesday to discuss when or whether to operate on him.</p>
<p>Seleznyov held out hope that Yeltsin would stand down if his health were too poor. &quot;You remember that Yeltsin himself said that he would not want to work at only a third of his strength,&quot; he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov on Monday cited remarks by one of Yeltsin's doctors that the Kremlin leader may not be able to withstand early surgery as evidence that he should quit.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said the communists' attacks were &quot;unacceptable&quot; and Yeltsin would not resign.</p>
<p>&quot;This is out of the question now,&quot; Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as telling reporters.</p>
<p>The communists have moved their attacks up a gear since cardiac surgeon Renat Akchurin, who is widely expected to operate on Yeltsin, suggested on Sunday that doctors could delay the president's bypass operation by at least six weeks.</p>
<p>The 65-year-old president has indicated he would not be happy being a &quot;passive&quot; ruler.</p>
<p>Some analysts suggest he might want to step down if he were unable to operate at full capacity.</p>
<p>But most Russians would find it hard to imagine him giving up power without a momentous fight, even if his heart bypass surgery were cancelled altogether, and the Kremlin appears to be digging in to keep Yeltsin in power for as long as possible.</p>
<p>If he had any plans to step down, his aides would be sure to advise him that it would not be in Russia's interests because calling an early presidential election would give his old foes, the communists, a chance to seize power.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if the president thought about stepping down, those around him would not let him do so,&quot; Alexander Konovalov, an analyst at Moscow's U.S.A. and Canada think tank, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;What Russia needs least of all right now is another election and what the aides think meets Russia's interests most is to keep Yeltsin the president for as long as possible.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeltsin said he was driven in his successful election campaign this year by a desire to stop the communists returning to power and to safeguard his political and economic reforms.</p>
<p>But Zyuganov, who finished second in the election runoff on July 3, scents victory now if Yeltsin steps down.</p>
<p>The communist leader believes he can cash in on the still widespread discontent with the hardships endured under market reforms and frustration with the president's failure to carry out a campaign promise to settle a huge backlog of unpaid wages.</p>
<p>An early election could split the centrist camp between three potential rivals -- security tsar Alexander Lebed, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.</p>
<p>Many analysts say the three men are already jostling for influence but do not want an election immediately because they need time to build up their power bases.</p>
<p>The communists' campaign is expected to be conducted mainly from the opposition-dominated State Duma, the lower house of parliament, but some analysts say it will come to little.</p>
<p>&quot;There will probably be some hysterics in the State Duma but I don't think they will have a big impact,&quot; said Alexander Golts, a commentator on the Krasnaya Zvezda newspaper.</p>
