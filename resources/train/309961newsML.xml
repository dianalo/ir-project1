<text>
<p>Growth from the African and ex-Soviet market led to a significant increase in freight volumes handled at Ostend airport, said a spokesman for the airport.</p>
<p>Freight traffic in 1996 rose 12.6 to 91,769 tonnes.</p>
<p>Ethiopian Airlines had increased its flights from twice weekly to daily Boeing 757 flights, he said, with the carrier sometimes leasing in aircraft as well.</p>
<p>Air Memphis and Egyptair were very active, he added, especially during the twice-yearly green bean season from Egypt. Daily flights during the season is not unusual, he added.</p>
<p>The growth was partly due to Belgium's historical links with Africa, he added. Perishable traffic out of African countries was also a reason for the increase in cargo, he said. Electronic goods, general consumer goods and car parts are major shipments into Africa, he added.</p>
<p>Daily flights are also coming into the Belgium airport from many CIS countries, he said. A third of all of the airport's cargo traffic is from CIS countries, said the spokesman.</p>
<p>There had been considerable growth from the many off-shoots of Aeroflot, he said.</p>
