<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch residents strike back against drugs tourists.</title>
<headline>Dutch residents strike back against drugs tourists.</headline>

<text>
<p>About 30 Rotterdam residents took the law into their own hands by beating up two French and two Belgian drugs tourists and wrecking their cars, Dutch police said on Monday.</p>
<p>The disgruntled inhabitants of Spangen, a western suburb of Rotterdam which draws drugs tourists from around the world, attacked the four people in separate incidents on Sunday, beating them and, according to police, totally destroying one car.</p>
<p>Spangen residents in 1995 demonstrated against drugs tourists attracted to the Netherlands by the Dutch policy of tolerating possession of small amounts of &quot;soft drugs&quot;.</p>
<p>But police are taking a hard line on vigilante drugs reformers, no matter how angry they become about the number of drugs houses in their area. &quot;This will absolutely not be tolerated,&quot; said a police spokeswoman.</p>
<p>She said the victims were not seeking to press charges.</p>
