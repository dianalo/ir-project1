<p>Intel Corp company and market fundamentals &quot;remain very strong&quot; and the company remains confident it can retain its leadership in the microprocessor marketplace, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>&quot;The fundamentals of Intel and of the marketplace remain very strong and the company really hasn't changed focus there,&quot; said Intel spokesman Howard High, in response to questions about the company's share activity.</p>
<p>Earlier, Intel shares had fallen as low as 130-1/2, down 7-3/8.  Analysts cited concerns about competing microprocessor products and general stock market weakness as factors.  </p>
<p>&quot;The personal computer business is doing wonderfully.  The Intel architecture is doing wonderfully within that business and there seems to be a reasonable level of activity and growth year on year,&quot; High added, without elaborating in detail.</p>
<p>&quot;We focus on managing the business and trying to do the right thing for customers and shareholders,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>High reiterated that the world's largest semiconductor company, due to report first quarter results after the market close on April 14, has not changed its guidance about the quarter since its mid-January investor conference call.  </p>
<p>The company said at that time that it expects revenues in the first quarter to be roughly flat sequentially with the $6.44 billion it posted in the fourth quarter of 1996, which would be a jump of 39 percent from $4.64 billion a year ago.</p>
<p>Intel said at the time that gross margins as a percent of revenues could be slightly lower in the first quarter than its strong 63 percent level in the fourth quarter and for the full year would be around the 60 percent level, as Intel is set to spend $4.5 billion on capital expenditures this year.</p>
<p>The company expects some increased manufacturing costs as it ramps up production of new chips this year as well.  </p>
<p>Earlier, analysts said competitive concerns were at least partly behind Intel's share decline, with chipmaking rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc, Cyrix Corp and Digital Equipment Corp announcing more competitive products.  Analysts added, however, that they did not see any great challenge to Intel's leadership position.</p>
<p>&quot;The reality is that a lot of companies will try to challenge Intel's posittion and they have various product offerings coming,&quot; said High.  &quot;What we have to do is take all of those things very seriously, which we always do.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But it's a great motivation to put our best and brightest products out there and see if we can retain our lead and we have confidence that we will do so,&quot; he added.</p>
