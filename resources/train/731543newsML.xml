<p>Boris Becker made a successful return to competitive tennis two weeks after his emotional farewell to Wimbledon by scoring a hard-fought win over Moroccan Karim Alami at the Stuttgart clay-court tournament on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Becker, playing his first match since his quarter-final defeat to Pete Sampras at the All England Club, needed two tie-breaks to overcome unseeded Alami 7-6 7-6.</p>
<p>The former world number one German, who said after losing to Sampras that he had played his last Wimbledon match, said he intended to play for a few more months before starting a new career as a coach.</p>
<p>Becker, who on Tuesday unveiled a team of young German players he intends to train, said last week he would enter the upcoming U.S. Open championships, ending speculation that his Wimbledon appearance could have been his last at a Grand Slam event.</p>
<p>More than 5,000 fans turned up in Stuttgart to watch their hero, who failed to impress but nevertheless managed to win.</p>
<p>But there was also bad news for Becker, who heard from the organisers of November's ATP Tour world championship that he would not get a wild card for the prestigious Hanover tournament.</p>
<p>Earlier in Stuttgart, Austria's Thomas Muster, the top seed, was ousted by unseeded Spaniard Alberto Portas in straight sets.</p>
<p>Muster, struggling to recapture the form which made him the world's best clay-court player, looked helpless at times on his way to a 6-4 7-5 defeat in the second round.</p>
<p>Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov, the second seed, recovered from a poor start to overcome Frenchman Fabrice Santoro in three sets, 2-6 6-3 6-4.</p>
<p>Briton Greg Rusedski, seeded 13th, lost a tight three-set battle with Swede Magnus Larsson. The unseeded Larsson, more at ease on clay than the hard-hitting Rusedski, won 7-6 6-7 6-4 to advance to the third round of the $1 million event.</p>
<p>Another seed to go out was Swiss Marc Rosset, who fell in straight sets to Spanish baseliner Francisco Clavet. Rosset, the 16th seed, lost 7-5 6-1.</p>
