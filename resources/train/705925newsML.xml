<p>Whichever way the cookie crumbles, the final decision is sure to be sweet.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Gov. William Weld must decide by July 10 whether to sign or veto legislation, passed Tuesday, designating the tollhouse chocolate chip cookie as the state's official cookie.</p>
<p>The tollhouse was invented in 1930 by a woman at the Toll House Restaurant in Whitman, Massachusetts, who ran out of cocoa while baking chocolate cookies.</p>
<p>But there's a bug in the batter. Weld has his own favourite cookie.</p>
<p>&quot;Several months ago when this was being debated, Gov. Weld threw his weight, which is considerable, behind the Fig Newton,&quot; said his deputy press secretary, Ilene Hoffer.</p>
<p>The Nabisco company invented the Fig Newton in Newton, Massachusetts, in 1891.</p>
<p>&quot;You got to stick with Fig Newtons,&quot; Weld said in April. &quot;Everybody I knew grew up with Fig Newtons...they're delicious.&quot;</p>
<p>Both sides in the weighty issue have tempted the governor to try to tip the scales in their favour, Hoffer said.</p>
<p>&quot;He's been tempted by the Fig Newton people as well as a couple platefuls of tollhouse cookies,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Boston Globe has asked readers to vote for their own favourite.</p>
