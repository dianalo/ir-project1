<p>The United States praised Mexico on Friday for arresting an alleged drug-trade kingpin, even as Washington was considering whether to certify Mexico as an ally in the fight against drugs.</p>
<p>&quot;The United States welcomes the arrest by the Mexican government of Oscar Malherbe de Leon,&quot; State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. &quot;He is a notorious and violent narco-trafficker ... We hope very much that now that he's arrested he might be prosecuted and brought to justice. If this is a trend, it's a good trend.&quot;  </p>
<p>Burns was asked about the arrest at a news briefing shortly after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright concluded a meeting with President Bill Clinton at which she gave Clinton her recommendation on whether Mexico should be recertified as a drug-fighting ally.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not aware that they have come to any final decision,&quot; said Burns, adding that an announcement on this delicate diplomatic issue would be made at the State Department as soon as Clinton made his decision. U.S. officials said earlier that could come later Friday but might be held over until Monday.</p>
<p>In announcing the arrest of Malherbe earlier on Friday, the Mexican attorney general described the suspect as having recently been &quot;at the head of the drug-trafficking operations of the so-called Gulf Cartel.&quot;</p>
<p>The United States issues its drug-war certifications annually and those who fail to get them could face economic sanctions as well as a diplomatic black eye. Mexico has always been certified, but Clinton has come under heavy political pressure to decertify it this year because the official in charge of its anti-drugs programme has been charged with corruption and taking bribes from drug-dealing criminals.</p>
