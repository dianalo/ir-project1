<p>Andre Agassi's season comes down to the wire in Paris this week.</p>
<p>Either the ninth seed does well enough at the Paris Open starting on Monday to pick up the points he needs to qualify for the season-ending ATP Tour World Championship in Hannover next month or he says goodbye until next season.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm coming to win,&quot; said the 1994 winner of the Bercy tournament. &quot;But my season ends in Paris if I don't manage to qualify for the Masters (former name of the ATP finals).&quot;</p>
<p>Agassi, top of the rankings earlier in the year, is placed ninth in the world rankings and needs to leapfrog eighth-placed South African Wayne Ferreira to qualify for the World Championship.</p>
<p>Agassi has been drawn for another clash with top seed Pete Sampras in the quarter-finals, the stage at which his fellow American dealt him a crushing defeat at the Stuttgart Open last Friday.</p>
<p>But Agassi feels he is only slightly short of his best form after an enforced layoff and enjoys Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;I recall playing very well in Paris and I love the crowd. The few matches I've won here have helped my game progress,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Agassi was unable to defend his title last year because of injury. In his only other appearance at the Paris Open in 1992 he went out in the first round.</p>
<p>World number one Sampras beat Boris Becker in straight sets in the 1995 final of the tournament first played in 1986 when the German won the first of his three titles.</p>
<p>Only one of the top 36 players in the world is missing Bercy, the richest tournamant on the ATP Tour with total prize money of $2.55 million. Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev has pulled out through injury.</p>
