<p>Britain on Tuesday urged all its citizens to leave Albania as soon as possible, saying the longer they stayed in the violence-ravaged Balkan state, the more dangerous it could be.</p>
<p>A Foreign Office spokesman said there were around 200 people in Albania for whom Britain was responsible, including some Irish and Commonwealth citizens.</p>
<p>&quot;The longer the delay, the more difficult and dangerous any departure may become. At the moment, most commercial airlines and ferry companies are operating normally, but this may change,&quot; he told a briefing.</p>
<p>The list of those in Albania included journalists, aid workers, businessmen and &quot;one or two intrepid tourists&quot;, he said. Albanian President Sali Berisha on Tuesday resumed talks with political party leaders on a new national unity government.</p>
<p>But rebels tightened their grip on the south of the country, taking control of several more major towns. At least 40 people have died in the latest wave of disturbances over the past 10 days.</p>
<p>A British charity said on Monday that it had pulled its British and Irish staff out of Albania, where they had recently set up a children's hospital in the southern port of Sarande.</p>
<p>The Children in Distress charity said the staff were withdrawn on the advice of the Foreign Office because of the worsening situation. Sarande has been the scene of rioting.</p>
