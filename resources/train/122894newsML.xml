<p>Opener Gary Kirsten lashed 84 from 81 deliveries as South Africa made 261 for seven off their 50 overs against India in the opening match of the Titan Cup triangular series on Thursday.</p>
<p>Kirsten smashed nine fours and one six, but his side slipped to 166 for six before captain Hansie Cronje hit an unbeaten 63 off 75 balls to restore their fortunes.</p>
<p>South Africa were given a solid foundation by the opening pair of Andrew Hudson and Kirsten, who compiled 74 runs off 81 balls.</p>
<p>The wayward Indian bowling was severely punished as Hudson launched the all-out attack by lifting Venkatesh Prasad for a straight six and twice struck Javagal Srinath to the leg-side boundary.</p>
<p>The partnership was broken when Hudson hit Prasad straight to Mohammad Azharuddin. Hudson's 34 runs came off 51 balls and included four boundaries and one six.</p>
<p>Pat Symcox, promoted to indulge in some big hitting, did not last long and was bowled by a flipper from Anil Kumble.</p>
<p>Kirsten and Daryll Cullinan then added 43 in 53 balls for the third wicket.</p>
<p>Kirsten, dominating the partnership, struck Sunil Joshi for a six to the sight screen, but the left-arm spinner broke the stand when Cullinan (16) lofted him to straight to Prasad at mid-off.</p>
<p>That was the start of a slump in which four wickets tumbled for 38.</p>
<p>Cronje and Brian McMillan, returning after a groin injury, halted the slide with a 76-run seventh-wicket stand off 80 deliveries.</p>
<p>McMillan's 32 came from 34 balls and included four fours while Cronje struck six fours in his half-century.</p>
