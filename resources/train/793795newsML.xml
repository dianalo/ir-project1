<headline>TOKYO STOCKS SEEN HOVERING IN NARROW RANGE.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1996-08-13</dateline>

<p>Tokyo stocks are expected to move in a relatively narrow range on Wednesday amid an absence of aggressive buyers or sellers, brokers said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Nikkei 225 average finished 274.93 points or 1.46 percent higher at 19,099.11. Its September futures gained 320 points to 19,100.</p>
<p>&quot;Stock prices will be capped by profit-taking,&quot; said a broker at a major Japanese brokerage.</p>
<p>But another broker said many participants will likely go bargain-hunting if the Nikkei 225 index falls below the 19,000 level.  </p>
<p>Brokers also said market sentiment will be generally cautious after a decline in New York stocks overnight. Buyers will bargain-hunt some international blue chips, they said.</p>
<p>Market players are also watching Nomura Securities Co Ltd's moves after the expiry of some of the penalties imposed for an illegal payoff scandal, they said.</p>
<p>Japan's biggest brokerage was banned from conducting stock-related business at its headquarters and all of its branches until Tuesday.</p>
<p>Market sources predicted trade would stay in a 18,850 to 19,250 range in the Nikkei 225 average.</p>
