<p>Vietnamese Communist Party chief Do Muoi arrived to a ceremonial welcome in Rangoon for a four-day visit to boost bilateral ties.</p>
<p>Prime Minister and chairman of the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC), General Than Shwe, and other senior officials of the military government met the Vietnamese party leader.</p>
<p>Do Muoi was given a 21-gun salute after he inspected a guard of honour and thousands of school children lined the streets waving flags of the two countries as he drove to the state guest house.</p>
<p>Government sources have said Do Muoi was expected to discuss boosting bilateral ties and Burma's impending and controversial entry as a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
<p>The seven-member group which include Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia and Vietnam, is expected to discuss Burma's possible entry into the bloc at a meeting in Malaysia on May 31.</p>
<p>Also in Do Muoi's 65-member delegation were Deputy Prime Minister Phan Van Khai and Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam.</p>
<p>The two countries have formed a joint commission for bilateral cooperation and also signed agreements to cooperate in narcotics control and bilateral cooperation in forestry.</p>
