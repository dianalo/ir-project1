<p>Ekaterina Koffa took a second sprint gold for Greece at the world indoor championships on Saturday at the end of a week in which Athens made the final shortlist of five candidates to stage the 2004 Olympics.</p>
<p>Koffa clocked 22.76 seconds to win the women's 200 metres final by a hundredth of a second from Jamaica's 1992 Olympic silver medallist Juliet Cuthbert.</p>
<p>On the first day of the three-day championships on Friday, Haralambous Papadias won the men's 60 metres title.</p>
<p>Trinidad's Ato Boldon, favourite for the men's 200 title, pulled up suddenly in the final straight and crumpled to the track.</p>
<p>His coach John Smith jumped down from the stands and watched anxiously as Boldon was carried from the track on a stretcher.</p>
<p>The race was won by American Kevin Little in 20.40 seconds.</p>
<p>&quot;It didn't surprise me at all, I felt I could not be beaten,' Little said. &quot;It's nice to have a superstar like Boldon in the race, it certainly takes the pressure off.</p>
<p>Moroccan Hicham el Guerrouj ran away with the men's 1,500 race although his time of three minutes 35.31 seconds was well outside his own world record of 3:31.18 set early last month.</p>
<p>German Ridger Stenzel was well back in second place ahead of Kenya's 1992 Olympic 800 champion William Tanui.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an easy race for me,&quot; said el Guerrouj. &quot;I was well prepared and I was not worried.</p>
<p>&quot;I have had a sensational start to this year and I hope there's more to come. This could be my year.&quot;</p>
<p>Kazakhstan's Igor Potapovitch won the men's pole vault with a leap of 5.85 metres despite the distractions of the men's long jump competition on the adjacent runway.</p>
<p>Inna Lasovskaya of Russia took the women's triple jump with a leap of 15.01 metres, only two centimetres short of the world record.</p>
<p>&quot;Paris was always my favourite town and Bercy my favourite track,&quot; said Lasovakaya.</p>
<p>The women's 3,000 metres, the final track event of the evening, was won in a thrilling sprint finish by Romania's defending champion Gabriela Szabo, who overhauled Irishwoman Sonia O'Sullivan over the final metres.</p>
