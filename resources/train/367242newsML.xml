<headline>Sweden unaware exports used in V2 rockets - experts.</headline>

<p>Sweden was probably not aware that mechanical parts it exported to Nazi Germany were used in V2 rockets which killed thousands of people in Britain and Belgium, Swedish experts said on Monday.</p>
<p>&quot;It is one thing to make parts for different weapons, another to export parts to such a thing (as V2 rockets),&quot; Hans Villius, a Swedish history professor, told Reuters. &quot;I do not think Sweden would have done that.&quot;</p>
<p>The World Jewish Congress on Friday released a letter in which a New York port official told the U.S. Secretary of State Edward Stettinius that an American ship had discovered V2 rocket parts labelled &quot;Made in Sweden&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;If Sweden had known what the parts would be used for, it would have erased the mark of origin,&quot; Villius said.</p>
<p>&quot;That is what Sweden did when it exported secret weapons to the resistance in Denmark towards the end of the war.&quot;</p>
<p>Villius pointed out that V2 was an extremely secret project which Sweden could not have known about.</p>
<p>Sweden, which was neutral during World War Two, had close trade links with Nazi Germany and sold iron ore and ball bearings to its munitions industry.</p>
<p>The V2 rocket parts in question could be ball bearings, which Sweden exported to Germany until late 1944, experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;It is not surprising that the Germans could have used ball bearings deriving from Sweden in the V2 rockets,&quot; said Alf Johansson, a history professor at the Swedish Military Academy. &quot;Sweden could not have known what the Germans used them for.&quot;</p>
<p>The Swedish foreign ministry said on Sunday it would look into whether the country supplied parts for the rockets.</p>
<p>&quot;We take this information very seriously and we will look into the matter,&quot; a foreign ministry spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The V2, according to then British Prime Minister Winston Churchill's &quot;The Second World War&quot; memoirs, killed 2,724 people in Britain and injured 6,476 during seven months in 1944 before The Hague -- from where most of the rockets were fired -- was liberated from German occupation.</p>
<p>Some 1,300 were fired at England and several hundred were fired in 1944 against Belgium.</p>
