<p>Brazilian lawmakers faced a quiet first week back in Congress after a short break with only a few bills due for a vote, officials said Monday.</p>
<p>More important pieces of legislation, including votes on the government pension and civil service reform bills, were only expected to be put on the agenda next week, they said.</p>
<p>The only scheduled vote on the floor of the Chamber of Deputies this week was on a bill which creates incentives and new financing opportunities for homebuilding by construction companies, a lower house official said.  </p>
<p>In the Senate, a constitutional amendment aimed at streamlining Brazil's clogged justice system was also due to be put to a vote, its second in the upper house.</p>
<p>The bill would prevent courts from judging constitutional issues which have already been settled by more than a two-thirds majority of the judges of the Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF), Brazil's highest court for constitutional matters.</p>
<p>The reform is opposed by the influential Order of Brazilian Lawyers, which says it will reduce the independence of the judicial system. But backers argue it will save time and money by cutting the workload of the courts.  </p>
<p>If fully approved in the Senate, the bill goes to the Chamber of Deputies.</p>
<p>Other possible action this week in Congress includes the start of the process for approval of Gustavo Franco as the new president of the Central Bank.</p>
<p>President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was expected to submit Monday the nomination of Franco to replace Gustavo Loyola as the head of the bank for approval in the Senate.</p>
<p>In the Chamber of Deputies, a bill outlining the rules for the October 1998 elections for the presidency, state governorships and many seats in Congress might be put to a committee-level vote.</p>
<p>The bill is reportedly opposed by the presidency because it imposes several restrictions on campaigning by holders of elected office seeking re-election.</p>
