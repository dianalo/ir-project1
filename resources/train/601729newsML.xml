<p>The Marxist guerrilla group that held 72 hostages in Peru for four months plans to blow up an ancient tunnel complex that inspired the military's bloody rescue strike, daily Expreso said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels recently left pamphlets scattered around the Chavin de Huantar ruins threatening to blast the 3,000-year-old tunnels in the northern Andes, the newspaper quoted police sources as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;According to the plan, they would blow up the site with strong explosives under the Chavin temple so as to block its subterranean passages,&quot; said the report, which police could not immediately confirm.</p>
<p>Peruvian troops burst out of a warren of tunnels to kill all 14 MRTA hostage-takers in their April 22 &quot;Operation Chavin de Huantar&quot; to free 72 captives held for 126 days at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima.</p>
<p>Two soldies and one hostage also died in the raid.</p>
<p>President Alberto Fujimori later said that a visit to the famous tunnel complex had given him the inspiration for the plan.</p>
<p>Sixty men working 24 hours a day spent three months and shifted 200 truckloads of earth to build the raid tunnels. Like the original Chavin de Huantar complex, the military's tunnels included sleeping and eating facilities, as well as food deposits.</p>
<p>The MRTA, which was demanding the freedom of jailed comrades in return for its hostages, has threatened reprisal attacks for the April 22 strike. The group has less than 200 fighters, mainly in Peru's eastern jungle, analysts say.</p>
