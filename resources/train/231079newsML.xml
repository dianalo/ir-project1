<p>Thirteen Singaporeans burned to death and 12 were injured on Tuesday when their tour bus rammed into a truck parked on the side of a highway near the Malaysian capital.</p>
<p>A police spokesman told reporters all the passengers were Singapore nationals on their way to the Genting Highlands, a hilltop casino resort that is popular with residents in neighbouring Singapore.</p>
<p>Those killed were five men, four women, and four children, police spokesman Mokhtar Hassan told reporters.</p>
<p>Both vehicles caught fire immediately after the bus slammed into the truck, which was carrying scrap metal, Mokhtar said.</p>
<p>Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim promised a thorough investigation into the crash, which occurred at 4.30 a.m. local time (2030 GMT Monday) outside the town of Nilai on the North-South Highway.</p>
<p>The national Bernama news agency quoted the bus driver, who escaped unscathed with his co-driver, as saying that he could not see the lorry he ploughed into.</p>
<p>&quot;I did not see the lorry in the dark and there was no warning light,&quot; Rosni Jaat, 31, told Bernama after he was detained by police.</p>
<p>Bernama said most of the survivors crawled out through broken windows. Some smashed windows to escape the burning bus, it said.</p>
<p>Sam Wei Jie, 10, was among those injured.</p>
<p>&quot;My father carried me out and put me on the side of the road but I can't remember what happened after that. There were flames all over the bus,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The boy's mother, aunt and grandfather are believed to be among the dead, hospital officials said. His father and grandmother were admitted to hospital.</p>
<p>Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong expressed shock at the accident, which Bernama said was one of the worst in Malaysia's history.</p>
<p>&quot;I am deeply shocked and saddened to learn of the death of so many Singaporeans this morning in the tragic accident on the North-South Highway in Malaysia,&quot; Goh said in a statement.</p>
