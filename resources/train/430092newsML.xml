<p>- Bosnian agency for refugees and displaced persons and Swedish Institute for Immigrants discussed possibilities of return of Bosnian refugees currently living in Sweden.

<p>- Serb Civic Council (SGV), which gathers Serbs living in the Moslem-Croat federation, formed a bureau for refugees and displaced persons. Some 10,000 Serbs from Drvar, actually under Croat control, are most likely to return to their homes.</p>

<p>- Chairman of Bosnia's three-man collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, told the ruling Moslem Party of Democratic Action (SDA) that Moslem-Croat federation will not suffer or be exposed to obstructions because of some uncontrolled elements from the Croat party HDZ.</p>
<p>- Izetbegovic told the state news agency BH PRESS that results from the Vienna conference on Brcko are satisfactory and expected. He welcomed newly appointed U.S. supervisor for Brcko Robert William Farrand and said the Bosnian side will provide full support and co-operation to supervisor. -- Sarajevo newsroom, +387-71-663-864</p>
