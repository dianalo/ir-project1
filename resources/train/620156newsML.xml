<p>Naphtha prices fell in afternoon Tokyo trade on Wednesday in reaction to a sharp drop in crude oil prices on overseas markets, traders said.</p>
<p>Open-spec naphtha for second-half July was quoted around $213.50/215.00 per tonne.</p>
<p>First-half August delivery was assessed at $214.00/215.50, compared with late Tuesday's levels of $217.75/218.75.</p>
<p>It was said to have been traded at $218.50 in early afternoon trade on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Second-half August was traded at $218.00 on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>In inter-month naphtha spreads, second-half July/second-half August was discussed at minus $1.00/minus 25 cents. It changed hands between South Korean trading houses at minus 25 cents in Tuesday's trade, market sources said.</p>
<p>In low sulphur waxy residue (LSWR) trading, demand from Japanese power firms, which are major customers of Indonesian LSWR cargoes, remained slack, traders said.</p>
<p>Although end-April fuel oil stocks at Japan's 10 regional power utilities fell seven percent from a year ago to 2.23 million kilolitres, lower stock levels have so far failed to spur the power firms to seek spot cargoes, they said.</p>
