<headline>LME gets off to slow start, trade lethargic.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>Activity was subdued during early Tuesday LME trading, with prices largely clinging to levels set late on Monday.</p>
<p>Traders saw little to suggest the market would be shaken out of its torpor in the short term, and said prices were just drifting gently lower.</p>
<p>&quot;It is summer, and there is a lot of lethargy around,&quot; one said.</p>
<p>Copper fluctuated in a $2,375/2,380 a tonne band, which was down from Monday's $2,399 kerb close but little different from the prices prevailing during late inter-office trading in the evening.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has held up fairly well, considering the (2,250-tonne) stock rise,&quot; the trader said.</p>
<p>But copper looked to be coming under pressure, with chart targets of $2,355 beckoning if current levels around $2,375 were lost.</p>
<p>Spreads were also softening in the run-up to the late July tight dates, with some lending seen throughout Monday. Cash/threes was around a $135 backwardation, some $15 softer than pre-weekend levels.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, aluminium sagged from initial steady levels to $1,579, down $8 from Monday. Another stock fall -- 3,150 tonnes -- passed by without any impact.</p>
<p>&quot;Stocks are down all the time now -- the surprise will be when they come in one day up,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>Zinc dipped back under $1,450 at one point, but was largely supported around that level and was just $4 easier at $1,452. In the short term, further consolidation below the recent $1,495 high seemed likely.</p>
<p>Nickel was trading routinely just under Monday's closing levels, with three months $60 softer at $6,800.</p>
<p>Tin and lead were indicated at softer levels of $5,520/40 and $651/653 respectively. Alloy was quoted at $1,435/40.</p>
