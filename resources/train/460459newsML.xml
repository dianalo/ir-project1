<title>BELGIUM: EU details probe into Thomson SA rescue plan.</title>
<headline>EU details probe into Thomson SA rescue plan.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-03-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Commission has expressed doubts about the viability of French holding company Thomson SA and its consumer electronics arm Thomson Multimedia despite France's proposal to inject 11 billion francs into the debt-laden group.</p>
<p>It said in a notice published in the European Union's Official Journal of March 20 that the French government had not sufficiently proved that the state-owned group would be able to return to profitability by 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission, therefore, requested a restructuring plan for the firm and called on Paris to propose measures that will compensate for a distortion of competition in a an already struggling sector.</p>
<p>A final decision was not expected before mid-June, a Commission official said.</p>
<p>The Commission announced in December it was investigating whether the 10.866-billion-franc cash injection amounted to state aid and if so, whether it could be allowed and under what conditions.</p>
<p>Publication of the detailed probe allows rival companies or interested governments to submit their views within a month.</p>
<p>The French government submitted the rescue plan in October when Thomson's profitable electronic defence subsidiary Thomson-CSF was expected to be sold off to the Lagardere group and the multimedia unit was to be acquired by Daewoo of South Korea.</p>
<p>The privatisation plan aborted, but France maintained Thomson Multimedia's rescue plan and pledged to sell it at a later stage.</p>
<p>Thomson Multimedia is Europe's second largest consumer electronics firm after Philips NV. It makes mainly television sets, video and audio equipment under the firm's brand name as well as Telefunken, Saba, Ferguson and RCA, its North American subsidiary.</p>
<p>Despite some commercial and technological successes -- the group is the world leader in digital television -- Thomson Multimedia accumulated losses of 10 billion francs between 1990 and 1995 and its debts rose to a total 15 billion francs in the same period, the notice said.</p>
<p>It said the Commission had &quot;reservations&quot; about the French authorities' December forecasts that the capital injection would put the group on the safe side by 1999.</p>
<p>The Commission judged that the market projections on which the forecasts were based were &quot;particularly optimistic&quot;, pointed out that the unspecified measures to compensate for harming competition had not been taken into account and argued that nothing could be certain without knowing the terms on which the multimedia unit might be privatised.</p>
<p>As part of the probe, the Commission also asked the French state to justify the price at which it agreed to buy Thomson SA's 3.01-percent stake in Credit Lyonnais.</p>
<p>It said the government agreed in April 1996 to pay a minimum 482 million francs for the stake, which represented a premium per share of 46 percent over the market price for the bank's investment certificates -- the only instrument quoted in the stock exchange.</p>
<p>The probe does not concern Thomson-CSF's direct shareholding in CL of 16.86 percent.</p>
