<p>Syria's vice-president and foreign minister arrived in Cairo on Friday for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the latest developments in the Middle East peace process, government sources said.</p>
<p>Vice-President Abdel-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara's visit comes on the day that Israeli soldiers began their redeployment in Hebron after a deal on Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank town.</p>
<p>&quot;The Syrian officials will discuss with President Mubarak developments in the peace process in light of a good and honest implementation of the Hebron deal, which is a step that will open the door to movement on the peace process as a whole,&quot; an Egyptian government source said.</p>
<p>Khaddam and Shara would first meet Prime Minister Kamal Ganzouri to discuss bilateral relations and Arab affairs over a working Iftar, or the meal that breaks the daylight fast of the Moslem month of Ramadan, the source said.</p>
<p>Mubarak and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad discussed by telephone &quot;some Arab issues&quot; on Thursday, a Syrian spokesman said. The official Syrian newspaper al-Thawra said on Friday there was nothing new to encourage Syria to resume peace talks with Israel.</p>
<p>Syria has held sporadic talks with Israel since 1991 but the negotiations have been blocked over the fate of the Golan Heights, occupied by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War. Talks broke off in March last year. 1045 170197 GMT</p>
