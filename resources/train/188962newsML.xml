<p>South Korean President Kim Young-sam's government faced mounting attacks on Thursday after a fresh bribery scandal involving the wife of a former minister cast doubts over its integrity.</p>
<p>Leading newspapers said the government and Kim's anti-corruption drive were now in tatters and opposition parties have called for a new government untainted by scandal.</p>
<p>Minister of Health and Welfare Lee Sung-ho stepped down on Wednesday, the third minister to leave in a month and the second to go under a cloud of corruption.</p>
<p>On Thursday Lee's wife, Park Sung-ae, was arrested on charges of accepting 170 million won ($205,000) handed to her in three batches between July and October last year from the head of an opticians' association.</p>
<p>Lee himself was cleared of any wrongdoing after being grilled by prosecutors for more than six hours on Wednesday, senior prosecutor Park Joo-sun said.</p>
<p>Last month Kim sacked his defence minister, Lee Yang-ho, who was formally charged on Monday with accepting bribes and leaking state secrets.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Gong Ro-myung stepped down on November 5 citing health reasons.</p>
<p>&quot;The current government has been crying out to root out corruption ever since it was established, but we don't see any progress in the reform drive with only one year left in the president's term,&quot; the Dong-a Ilbo newspaper said in an editorial.</p>
<p>President Kim has polished his Mr Clean image since taking office in 1993 by bringing to justice on charges of corruption former presidents Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae-woo.</p>
<p>He is due to step down when his single term expires after presidential elections in December next year.</p>
<p>On Thursday he shrugged off criticism, conceding he faced difficulties rooting out bribery but insisting the fight against graft would continue.</p>
<p>&quot;There are always troubled people, but they have to be cleaned out. The anti-corruption drive should continue to the end of time,&quot; he told a television interviewer.</p>
<p>The Chosun Ilbo newspaper ran an editorial headlined &quot;Disappointing Kim Young-sam cabinet&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;The biggest problem is the consciousness level of high government officials,&quot; it said. &quot;Although human instinct is to crave wealth, they shouldn't be using their positions to collect wealth and fortune through illegal means.</p>
<p>&quot;We are all unfortunate for having a cabinet so weak and disordered,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>The main opposition National Congress for New Politics seized on the scandal to attack Kim's administration.</p>
<p>&quot;The current government was born corrupt,&quot; it said in a statement on Wednesday. &quot;The anti-corruption drive has to begin with a fundamentally new start. This calls for a new government.&quot;</p>
<p>The minor United Liberal Democrat Party said the &quot;government's morality has evaporated completely with continuous bribery scandals involving ministers&quot;.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Kim Tae-ok, president of the Korean Optometrics Association, had also been arrested on charges of paying money to the wife of the former health minister.</p>
<p>The association was seeking changes in the law to give its members a monopoly over the sale of spectacle frames.</p>
