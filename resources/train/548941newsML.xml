<title>TURKEY: Turk army in &quot;life or death&quot; fight with Islamists.</title>
<headline>Turk army in &quot;life or death&quot; fight with Islamists.</headline>

<p>A leading Turkish general on Tuesday said the armed forces' struggle against Islamist activities was vital to the survival of the secular republic.</p>
<p>&quot;Destroying fundamentalism is of life or death importance,&quot; General Kenan Deniz told a special briefing for journalists to lay out the military's position in its row with the government of Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.</p>
<p>The general also blasted neighbouring Iran, with whom Erbakan has made a special effort to patch up strained ties, for seeking to undermine Turkey by providing overt support for the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).</p>
<p>&quot;Iran... is continuing with its efforts to destroy the regime in the Turkish republic,&quot; said Deniz, a leader in the security forces' fight with the PKK. &quot;It is known to have directed terrorist actions in Turkey.&quot;</p>
<p>The general's tough talk follows weeks of mounting tensions between the armed forces, traditional defenders of Turkey's secularist system, and Erbakan, modern Turkey's first Islamist leader.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Erbakan reluctantly agreed to demands from the army for a series of anti-Islamist measures, but his Islam-based Welfare Party has made it clear it was not prepared to go along with reforms that would close Koranic schools.</p>
<p>Turkey's generals have toppled three civilian governments since 1960, but have been content in recent weeks to only hint at possible intervention this time around.</p>
<p>The ensuing crisis has sent political leaders scrambling to find a new government formula to exclude Erbakan. It has also put renewed pressure on Turkish markets.</p>
