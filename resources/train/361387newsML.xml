<p>O.J. Simpson's wealth has dwindled from $8 million to $500,000 in the space of a year, according to records given to plaintiffs' attorneys by the defence in the former football star's civil trial.</p>
<p>Simpson's net worth is crucial following Tuesday's verdict which blamed Simpson for the June 12, 1994, murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman.</p>
<p>The jury, which granted the plaintiffs compensatory damages of $8.5 million, will hear testimony from financial experts on Thursday and must then decide on punitive damages to punish Simpson for his actions, which they found were performed with &quot;malice&quot; and &quot;oppression.&quot;</p>
<p>According to an investigation by CNN and Time magazine published before Wednesday's court proceedings, Simpson's net worth was estimated at $11 million four years ago.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs' attorney Peter Gelblum told Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki in a hearing on Wednesday that when Simpson's attorneys first disclosed his finances they said he was worth $8 million, but in their latest papers he had only $500,000.</p>
<p>A source familiar with the case told Reuters the first financial disclosure was in February 1996.</p>
<p>A criminal court jury acquitted Simpson of the murders in October 1995. He was sued in the current wrongful death civil trial by the families of the victims.</p>
<p>Fujisaki, in the hearing on Wednesday with jurors absent, ruled the jury may be told by a plantiffs' expert that Simpson could earn more than $24 million over the next 20 years through endorsements and the sale of his &quot;image and likeness.&quot;</p>
<p>The judge also rejected a motion by Simpson's lawyers that no punitive damages be awarded because members of the Brown and Goldman families and their attorneys breached the judge's &quot;gag order&quot; by talking to the press after the verdicts were read in court.</p>
<p>Simpson will serve no jail time, but could lose much of what is left of the fortune he earned in his days as a football star, advertising pitchman and sportscaster. Attorney Leo Terrell, a friend and strong supporter of Simpson, told Cable News Network the verdict would be appealed.</p>
<p>Attorney Robert Tourtelot, who filed suit on behalf of the Goldmans before being replaced, said the &quot;huge&quot; compensatory damages showed the punitive award &quot;is going to be gigantic.&quot;</p>
<p>Legal analysts said the plaintiffs could hound him for the rest of his life, forcing him to auction his Bentley, give up his tennis courts and adopt a more modest lifestyle.</p>
<p>While only Goldman's family was entitled to compensatory damages, Nicole Brown Simpson's estate will share in any punitive award.</p>
<p>While the lawyers in the case were barred from comment on the trial, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, an adviser to Simpson's criminal defence team, said there were &quot;some very substantial issues&quot; on which to base an appeal, including: &quot;The admission of the lie-detector test evidence, the anonymous phone call to the battered women's hotline from a woman called Nicole.&quot;</p>
<p>Simpson testified he took a lie detector test as an experiment but disputed plaintiffs' attorney Daniel Petrocelli's assertion he failed it. A woman who told jurors she took the battered women's call from a &quot;Nicole&quot; said the caller complained she was being &quot;stalked&quot; by her ex-husband.</p>
<p>But Dershowitz held out little chance of a reversal of the verdict. &quot;Judges in California are going to look very long and hard before they reverse what will be a very popular verdict among their constituents. I don't predict there will be a reversal of this verdict,&quot; he told NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show.</p>
<p>Christopher Darden, a member of the unsuccessful criminal trial prosecution team, said the difference in the civil case was that Simpson had to testify. &quot;O.J. lied in front of this jury, he lied to the black community and he lied to the American public. This jury focused on the evidence, not race or politics,&quot; he said.</p>
