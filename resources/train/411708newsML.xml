<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch call money rises as market digests rate hike.</title>
<headline>Dutch call money rises as market digests rate hike.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-02-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch money market trading on Friday was reinvigorated by Thursday's 0.20-percent hike in the special advances rate to 2.70 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said the rate increase was linked to the weaker guilder-mark rate and was aimed at reducing the gap on Germany's 3.0-percent repo rate.</p>
<p>But the guilder hardly reacted to the move and was quoted at 112.44 versus 112.42 on Thursday.</p>
<p>One dealer said the current 0.7-percent gap between the Dutch special advances rate and the secured loans rate was illogical.  </p>
<p>&quot;Now that we know what's happening, rates on the money market are likely to stabilise, and many parties are more confident about getting back into the market,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>He said trade was fairly active compared to recent sluggishness. Trade focused on overnight money, which changed hands at 2.94 percent, and tomorrow next money.</p>
<p>Call rates were between 2.88 and 2.93 bid.</p>
<p>One dealer pointed out one- and six-month deposits were also more active, as increased certainty over short rates lured investors back.</p>
<p>One-month deposits were down four basis points from Thursday at 3.02 percent, while six-month deposits lost two basis points, bid at 3.10 percent.</p>
<p>Prices on the two new Dutch Treasury Certificates (DTCs), maturing on May 30 and December 31, were unchanged from Thursday at 3.07 and 3.16 percent, respectively.</p>
