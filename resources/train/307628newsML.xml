<p>The government on Tuesday ignored calls for a quick fix for Japan's ailing stock market and stuck to its view that the economy is still growing.</p>
<p>The official monthly assessment of the economy, issued by the Economic Planning Agency (EPA), used the same phraseology to describe economic conditions as in December and prescribed the same remedies to secure recovery.</p>
<p>&quot;Although stock prices are falling, the current state of the economy is that it is continuing to recover gradually and is more or less firm,&quot; an EPA official said.</p>
<p>The report said Japan would continue to promote various economic structural reforms including deregulation and work towards managing the economy properly to secure growth.</p>
<p>&quot;Share prices may move according to their own principles, but I'd like to say that the economic indicators are not moving in a bad direction,&quot; EPA Minister Taro Aso told reporters.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, asked if his ministry was considering any special steps to tackle the recent stock plunge, said its first priority was to put in place an already planned extra budget as soon as possible.</p>
<p>But he added: &quot;We will continue to watch movements in the stock market with deep interest.&quot;</p>
<p>The stock market seemed little impressed, resuming its month-long slide after a partial recovery on Monday.</p>
<p>The benchmark Nikkei average of 225 leading shares fell more than 500 points in the first 30 minutes of trade, though it clawed back to close down 25.66 points at 18,093.13. The index lost 2,000 points last week.</p>
<p>The EPA official said falls in share prices may have a negative impact on business sentiment, and thus corporate capital spending, but only to a limited extent.</p>
<p>Corporate capital spending was on the rise and firms would be forced to invest to survive various structural reforms in the economy, he said.</p>
<p>He was aware of worries that stock price falls would undermine the ability of Japanese banks to deal with risks and bad loans and dampen lending, but said that given weak fund demand in Japan, lending was unlikely to be greatly affected.</p>
<p>Despite the government's insistence that economic prospects are not so bad, economists have joined a chorus of those warning about additional downward risks.</p>
<p>&quot;It is clear that the Nikkei crash has increased the downside risk to 1997 economic forecasts,&quot; said Jesper Koll, head of research at J.P. Morgan Securities Asia Ltd.</p>
<p>Senior officials of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) are also putting pressure on the government to address stock market woes.</p>
<p>Jiji news agency quoted Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the LDP's policy-making committee, as saying he had urged the government to consider new measures to tackle weak share prices in a morning meeting of economic ministers.</p>
<p>Japanese media reports said Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto was planning to meet Chief Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama and Finance Minister Mitsuzuka on Tuesday night to discuss current management of the economy.</p>
<p>Hashimoto, on the last leg of a Southeast Asian tour, was due to return to Japan from Singapore later in the day.</p>
