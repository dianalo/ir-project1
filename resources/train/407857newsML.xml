<p>Former Commission President Jacques Delors on Thursday called for the creation of a special protocol committing countries heading towards European currency union to cooperate on macro-economic policy.</p>
<p>Delors, speaking at a conference in Frankfurt, said such a commitment would help smooth out possible shocks within the European economy, while promoting growth and job creation.</p>
<p>He added that such a measure should not be feared as compromising the independence of a future European Central Bank, an issue that has caused apparent conflict among some European Union countries.</p>
<p>&quot;The extent of cooperation has recently not been very encouraging. This is all the more reason to detail within a protocol the procedures and instruments for real agreement in macro-economic policies that is also compatible with the accords included in the stability pact,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The stability pact, agreed late last year in Dublin, aims to ensure the stability of European economic conditions after monetary union, due 1999.</p>
<p>Delors said the laws and statutes relating to the German Bundesbank -- which among other things listed its goals as including price stability, full employment and sufficient growth -- showed that such a move was not necessarily incompatible with central bank independence.</p>
<p>&quot;The same (goals) will apply to the European Central Bank, whose independence will naturally be completely respected,&quot; Delors, president of the European Commission between 1985-95, said.</p>
<p>&quot;We could expect much from an economic union that was based both on the idea of macro-economic cooperation...and a completely independent European central bank,&quot; he added.</p>
