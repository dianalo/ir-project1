<p>Coventry manager Ron Atkinson and player Gordon Strachan have been charged with bringing the game into disrepute after Strachan had a row with a referee last week, the English Football Association (FA) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Former Scotland international Strachan, who is also Coventry's assistant manager, brought last Thursday's reserve game against West Bromwich Albion to a temporary halt when he refused to leave the pitch after being ordered off for foul language.</p>
<p>The game was eventually restarted, without Strachan, after a 14-minute delay.</p>
<p>Atkinson's charge relates to remarks the manager made to referee Tony Green in the dressing-room area after the incident.</p>
<p>Both have 14 days to answer the charges.</p>
<p>The FA has also asked Atkinson and Strachan to explain incidents in a match at Chelsea on August 24 which Coventry lost 2-0.</p>
<p>The pair were involved in angry touchline scenes over Chelsea's first goal, scored by Frank Leboeuf after Dan Petrescu was alleged to have handled.</p>
<p>An FA spokesman said referee Paul Danson's report had raised the question of their conduct: &quot;As a result we have written to them, asking them for their observations.&quot;</p>
