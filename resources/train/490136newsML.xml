<headline>NHL-DEVILS BLANK BLUES FOR THIRD STRAIGHT SHUTOUT.</headline>
<dateline>ST. LOUIS 1997-04-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mike Dunham got New Jersey's third straight shutout and Jay Pandolfo's goal with 6:26 left in the third period broke a scoreless tie as the red-hot Devils blanked the St. Louis Blues 2-0 Sunday for their fifth successive win.</p>
<p>Dunham turned aside 25 shots for his second shutout of the season and the team's fourth in five games.</p>
<p>&quot;It's nice to get, it's a team thing,&quot; Dunham said. &quot;The team played well again. I don't think I saw a rebound shot, to be honest. We're being patient and waiting to get those goals.&quot;</p>
<p>John MacLean added an empty-net goal for the Devils, who have allowed just two goals in their last five games and remained atop the Eastern Conference standings with 101 points, one ahead of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>New Jersey is 7-1-1 in its last nine road contests and broke a five-game winless streak at St. Louis, winning there for the first time since December 1, 1990.</p>
<p>&quot;I thought we would get a few goals and they would get a few goals, too. It is remarkable what we've been doing lately,&quot; said Devils coach Jacques Lemaire.</p>
<p>Grant Fuhr made 17 saves for the Blues, who had their four-game unbeaten streak snapped. St. Louis and Chicago are tied for the final two Western Conference playoff spots.</p>
<p>The little-used Pandolfo cut down the slot and tapped Denis Pederson's centering pass from the lower right faceoff circle under Fuhr's glove for his fourth goal of the season and first since January 29.</p>
<p>MacLean tallied with 17 seconds remaining, giving him goals in three straight games.</p>
<p>New Jersey has a league-leading 12 shutouts and has held opponents to one goal or less in 30 of 78 games. The Devils have scored first 56 times -- tops in the league -- and are 39-10-7 in those contests.</p>
<p>In Denver, Patrick Roy stopped 24 shots in his first action in 11 days and Joe Sakic scored the game-winner in the second period as the Colorado Avalanche edged the Phoenix Coyotes 2-1 for their franchise-record 48th win of the season.</p>
<p>Keith Tkachuk tallied for Phoenix to become the NHL's first 50-goal scorer of the season. It is the latest date in a non-lockout season that the league has had its first 50-goal scorer since there were none in 1969-70.</p>
<p>Roy missed three games since injuring his right shoulder in a wild scuffle at Detroit. But he showed no signs of rust, carrying a shutout into the third period.</p>
<p>Stephane Yelle had the other goal for the Avalanche, who broke the previous mark of 47 wins, set in 1992-93 when the team was based in Quebec and equalled last season.</p>
<p>In Calgary, Chris Chelios scored with 7:57 left to break a tie and Jeff Hackett made 33 saves to lead the Chicago Blackhawks to a 2-1 road victory over the Flames in a key battle for the final playoff spot in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>The Flames are four points behind St. Louis and Chicago with three games left. Calgary visits Chicago on Friday.</p>
<p>Chelios, who was upended by Glen Featherstone in the second period and landed on his back, shook off the injury to score the game-winner. He kept the puck in the offensive zone at the right point and floated a wrist shot that eluded Trevor Kidd.</p>
<p>Chelios also set up Ethan Moreau's first-period goal. Marty McInnis pulled Calgary into a 1-1 tie midway through the second period.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Pat Falloon scored with 22 seconds left in the second period to break a tie and lift the Flyers to a 2-1 win over the Ottawa Senators.</p>
<p>The loss was costly for the Senators, who are tied with Hartford for the eighth and final playoff spot in the East with 71 points. But Ottawa has just three more games left, one fewer than the Whalers, and has two fewer victories. The Senators have never made the playoffs.</p>
<p>Trent Klatt got the Flyers on the board 51 seconds into the game with a shorthanded goal. Sergei Zholtok tallied at 3:24 of the first to tie it 1-1.</p>
<p>At Washington, Peter Bondra scored with 50 seconds left in regulation to rally the Capitals into a 3-3 tie with the Florida Panthers.</p>
<p>The Capitals, who are 0-4-1 in their last five games, are desperately clinging to their playoff hopes.</p>
<p>The tie moved the Capitals out of a tie with the Islanders in the Eastern Conference and into a deadlock with Tampa Bay at 69 points, two behind Hartford and Ottawa and three back of Montreal.</p>
