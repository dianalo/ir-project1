<headline>S.Africa's P.W. Botha says will not seek amnesty.</headline>

<p>South Africa's hardline former state president, P.W. Botha, said on Wednesday he would never seek amnesty from the country's post-apartheid Truth and Reconciliation Commission.</p>
<p>&quot;I will not ask for amnesty, not now, not tomorrow, not the day after tomorrow. I will not ask for forgiveness for being an Afrikaner Boer,&quot; Botha said in a state television interview.</p>
<p>&quot;What I did, I did because I believed it was the best for South Africa under the circumstances.&quot;</p>
<p>Denying that he had ever ordered the security forces to commit murder or operate outside the law, he added: &quot;I have never said so-and-so should be killed. Give me one example.&quot;</p>
<p>Former apartheid police officers have charged in testimony to the truth commission that Botha personally authorised &quot;dirty tricks&quot; against anti-apartheid activists.</p>
<p>Botha's political career ended in 1989 after he suffered a stroke and was forced to quit the presidency in favour of F.W. de Klerk.</p>
<p>His resignation cleared the way for accelerated reform and an end to apartheid under de Klerk, who freed Nelson Mandela and unbanned the now ruling African National Congress in 1990.</p>
<p>Discussing his departure from politics, Botha remarked: &quot;I am not a bootlicker, and I am not a fool.&quot;</p>
<p>He recounted a meeting with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl during the 1980s, Botha said he had offered to free Mandela should Kohl persuade Europe to lift economic sanctions against South Africa.</p>
<p>&quot;He (Kohl) said: 'I'll write you a letter'. I have not yet received that letter. I don't say it to disparage him. It's the truth,&quot; Botha said. Qualifying his willingness to release Mandela from jail, Botha added this would have depended on the ANC leader's preparedness to renounce violence.</p>
<p>The Truth and Reconciliation Commission on apartheid-era crimes was set up by President Mandela in 1995 in a bid to promote national reconciliation and heal the wounds of the past.</p>
<p>Botha's 75-year-old wife Elize died at their coastal home near George earlier this month. Retired Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who heads the truth probe, attended the funeral.</p>
