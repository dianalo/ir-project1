<p>Shares continued to ease on Lithuania's sluggish bourse on Friday with no immediate pick up in sight, dealers said.</p>
<p>The group A index dipped by 44.69 points to 2,396.70 in dull trade of just over one million litas.</p>
<p>The Lithuanian Sea Shipping Company slid to 7.08 litas from 7.65 litas in turnover of 54,400 litas. It earlier reported a net profit of 49 million litas in 1996 versus 67.67 million litas in 1995.</p>
<p>Kalnapilis brewery dipped slightly to 7.98 litas from 8.00 litas and 7,700 litas worth of its shares changed hands, while Rokishkis Cheese fell to 48.00 litas from 49.99 litas in trade of 65,600 litas.</p>
<p>Birzai Dairy and cardboard maker Medienos Plausas seemed unaffected by their 1996 results, which fell short of market expectations.</p>
<p>Birziu dairy made a slight gain, firming to 8.05 litas from 8.02 litas in turnover of 22,400 litas, while Medienos Plausas held steady at 15.00 litas.</p>
<p>Dealers say that the market, which is struggling after a brief but spectacular bull run last month, is not likely to pick up steam for a couple of weeks though gains are seen on the horizon.</p>
<p>&quot;Prices are comparatively low now, but investors seem to be waiting for them to fall some more,&quot; Tomas Andrejauskas, a dealer with Vilnius brokerage house Suprema, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;When they do, interest will increase, but it won't happen immediately,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dealers also say that a spate of disappointing results released this week for key companies has dampened investor appetite in the market.</p>
<p>Investors are still waiting for results from the big commercial banks, including market leader Vilniaus Bank.</p>
<p>Trade on the secondary T-bill market was a brisk 7.4 million litas but dealers say that one bank needed some capital and that it was not a sign that investors are switching from equity to debt.</p>
<p>Block trades worth 313,00 litas were also made on Friday.</p>
