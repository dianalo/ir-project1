<p>Chile's state copper company Codelco may recover less than $12 million in damages from court cases against Belgian and German brokers over failed futures deals, reported evening newspaper La Segunda Monday.</p>
<p>Codelco has started court cases in London against Belgian brokerage Sogemin Ltd and Germany's Metallgesellschaft over the loss-making deals by Codelco's former top futures operator Juan Pablo Davila.  </p>
<p>Asked what sums Codelco expected to receive from Sogemin and Metallgesellschaft, Codelco president Marcos Lima replied:&quot; Up to now we have shown them to be close to $9.8 million in one case (Sogemin) and $1.5 million in the other (Metallgesellschaft).&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;These were (sums) deposited in Davila's personal accounts or in those of related companies,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, has accused both firms of paying secret commissions to Davila to persuade him to keep speculating in copper futures markets.</p>
<p>Brokerage Merrill Lynch agreed last week to pay Codelco $25 million to end a dispute over Codelco's allegations that the brokerage encouraged Davila to carry out unauthorized futures trading.</p>
<p>All three companies have denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Codelco says its investigations have shown payments by Sogemin and Metallgesellschaft into secret bank accounts owned by Davila and his associates in the Cayman Islands.</p>
<p>The discoveries were the result of a three-year probe by Codelco into the deals which cost the company around $170 million in 1993 and sparked Chile's worst financial scandal.</p>
<p>Although most of the losses are unrecoverable as they relate to trading losses due to price swings, Codelco has been keen to pursue brokers who it suspects of paying illicit kickbacks to the once high-flying trader.</p>
<p>Davila, fired as soon as the losses were uncovered in 1994, has been charged with fraud and carrying out business &quot;incompatible&quot; with his position in Codelco.</p>
<p>He was recently released from preventive detention in a Santiago jail to undergo cancer treatment. ((-- Margaret Orgill, Santiago newsroom, 562-699-5595x212))</p>
