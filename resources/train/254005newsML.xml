<p>Israel lashed out at the Palestinian Authority and closed off the West Bank town of Ramallah on Thursday after an Arab guerrilla attack that killed a Jewish settler and her 12-year-old son.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the Authority should understand there is no point in peace talks or agreements if they do not result in security,&quot; Finance Minister Dan Meridor told Army Radio.</p>
<p>&quot;This demand has been conveyed to them very sharply and clearly and they must take action,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu gave no firm sign the drive-by killing of the two Israelis near Ramallah on Wednesday would lead to a freeze in talks with the PLO on Israeli troop redeployment from Hebron in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Jewish settler leaders publicly demanded a halt to the slow-moving negotiations over Hebron, where 400 Jews live amidst some 100,000 Arabs.</p>
<p>&quot;Whenever (Palestinian President Yasser Arafat) runs into a problem, he tries to pressure Israel and achieve results. So he lets them run free and there is an attack,&quot; said Issar Slumiansky, mayor of the Elkana settlement.</p>
<p>Israeli Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said George Habash's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) was responsible for the attack on the settler family.</p>
<p>The woman's husband and four other children were wounded in the shooting and Israeli security officials said they believe the guerrillas had fled into self-ruled Ramallah.</p>
<p>The Israeli army announced it had sealed off the town.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure the Palestinian Authority could have done much more to handle the PFLP and other terrorist groups,&quot; Mordechai said on Army Radio. The PFLP opposes the interim PLO-Israel peace deals.</p>
<p>&quot;If it had dealt with the PFLP intensively and continuously, it is possible this attack could have been prevented,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Authority condemned the shooting, a PLO official told Reuters. He voiced suspicion Israel would use the attack as an excuse to renege on a deal signed by the previous Labour government to pull troops out of most of Hebron.</p>
<p>Netanyahu, who won election in May pledging to boost security for Israelis following suicide attacks by Moslem militants last February and March, broke off a vacation and rushed to a Jerusalem hospital to visit the wounded.</p>
<p>He said the killings and apparent fleeing of the gunmen to Ramallah posed a &quot;test&quot; for Arafat.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect that they will extradite and first of all help us to arrest these murderers of children, murders of women...We will not let up until we catch them,&quot; Netanyahu said.</p>
<p>But Yossi Beilin, a former peace negotiator and minister in the previous centre-left Labour government, said the Palestinian Authority was not required under the peace deals to extradite suspected guerrillas if it put them on trial.</p>
<p>Netanyahu was due to consult cabinet ministers before the funeral later on Thursday of Etta Tzur, 42, and her son Ephraim, on what steps Israel should take in the wake of the attack.</p>
<p>Jewish settler leaders also planned to convene in an emergency session.</p>
