<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>
<headline>Dutch closing share market report.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-10-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch shares ended lower, after a dipping Wall Street opening and falling U.S. jobless claims added to already weaker sentiment.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected a sideways pattern in the near-term since recent euphoria was fading.</p>
<p>The AEX share index slipped 3.47 points to 584.37. &quot;The index is likely to linger between 580-590 points,&quot; said one dealer, adding new highs were not expected in the near term.</p>
<p>KLM closed at a year-low at 41.60 guilders, off 1.40.</p>
<p>Industrial holding firm Atag and retail chain KBB nosedived on unfavourable profit forecasts.  </p>
<p>KBB sank almost 10 percent, or 13.50 guilders, to 128.50.</p>
<p>Koninklijke Bijenkorf Beheer said last night it expected full-year net from ordinary operations in the 1996/97 financial year to lag significantly behind that of the previous year.</p>
<p>The stock started tumbling at the open, taking Vendex in its wake. Vendex, which earlier this week said it was planning to sell its 36 percent stake in KBB, shed 2.50 guilders to 70.00.</p>
<p>&quot;KBB's profit warning was not really a present for Vendex as it was planning to sell the shares within two weeks,&quot; said one dealer. &quot;But, I stick to my buy recommendation for Vendex,' the dealer said, despite the bad-luck with the sell-off.  </p>
<p>SmallCap Atag, which rose on Wednesday on two buy-recommendations, fell hard on Thursday, since the firm said profits would be much lower during the third quarter.</p>
<p>Atag dipped to 111 guilders from 127.50 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>KLM ended at a year-low. Dealers said competition was fierce for the airline carrier and rising oil prices did not support the stock as well.</p>
<p>Financials, somewhat weaker, were expected to perform slightly better than the overall market in the near term.</p>
<p>Philips surprised dealers as the stock managed to stay in positive territory for most of the day.  </p>
<p>Philips handed back the gains near the close to end 0.10 guilders lower at 64.00.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was cautiously waiting for the giants third quarter results, due October 24.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's U.S. PPI data could have an impact on the market, but dealers said this was not likely.</p>
<p>Analysts have forecast a 0.3 percent rise for the U.S. PPI on a month-to-month basis, the same as the previous month.</p>
<p>Today's U.S. jobless claims were lower than expected, which slightly depressed the market.</p>
