<headline>Irish bonds slip, yield spread over Germany widens.</headline>
<dateline>DUBLIN 1997-04-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Irish bonds were weaker in late trade on Friday and yield spreads over German widened in the 10-year area after a good performance earlier in the week on the back of a successful domestic auction, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The trend of the day was we saw some unwinding of spreads after the auction. The feeling in the market over the last few days was that we had reached the top after the auction. The market has since come off,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The National Treasury Management Agency's (NTMA) auction of 150 million Irish pounds of the eight percent bond due 2006 on Tuesday was covered 5.15 times.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market's underlying tone was firm.</p>
<p>By 1445 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was down 10 pence from Thursday's close at 102.15 to yield 5.93 percent while the key benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 eased 25 pence to 108.75 to yield 6.70 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said Irish bonds were yielding 88 basis points over German bunds in the 10-year area, a widening of two basis points on the close.</p>
