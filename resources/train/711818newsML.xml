<headline>Australian official reserve assets rise in June.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-07-07</dateline>

<p>Australia's holdings of gold and foreign exchange assets rose to US$17.024 billion in June from US$16.975 billion in May, compared with US$15.037 billion in June 1996, the Reserve Bank of Australia said.</p>
<p>In Australian dollar terms, reserves rose by A$538 million to A$22.835 billion in June from A$22.297 billion in May, compared with A$19.059 billion a year earlier, the bank said.</p>
<p>The bank said the rise mainly reflected valuation effects arising from the appreciation of foreign currencies against the Australian dollar. Net transactions over the month were small, the RBA said.  </p>
<p>The RBA said that within the total there was a shift in composition out of gold into foreign currency investments.</p>
<p>Last week, the RBA announced that it had sold 167 tonnes of gold over the past six months, reducing its holdings to 80 tonnes. The first 125 tonnes of that gold were delivered in June and the remainder are to be delivered in August and September.</p>
<p>The RBA said holding of gold fell by A$1,830 million, while holdings of other reserve assets rose by A$2,368 million in June, reflecting the re-investment of the gold proceeds and the valuation effects in the month.  </p>
