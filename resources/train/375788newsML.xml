<p>West Virginia Gov. Cecil Underwood proposed a $2.4 billion budget for fiscal 1998 that uses most of the state's new revenues to pay off pension fund and federal obligations.</p>
<p>The budget unveiled in Underwood's state-of-the state speech Wednesday night increases spending by $80 million over the current year, but does not cut or raise taxes.</p>
<p>Underwood proposed that the state put $32 million into the Teachers Retirement Fund &quot;in order to keep the fund solvent and protect our improving bond rating.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the state could not afford to do that and still give teacher pay raises this year, but should make &quot;the responsbile choice&quot; by putting the money into the pension fund.</p>
<p>&quot;We made a commitment to teachers and service personnel and we simply must honor it,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Underwood urged lawmakers to repay the state Board of Investments $10 million that was borrowed in previous years for prison projects.</p>
<p>He also urged lawmakers to use $27 million from the state's rainy day fund to repay money the state owes to the federal government for overpayments into West Virginia's Public Employee Retirement System.</p>
<p>He urged lawmakers to adopt enabling legislation to issue the $550 million of highway bonds that voters approved in November.</p>
<p>Part of that money should go toward construction of a network of four-lane highways throughout the state, specifically the Southern Coal Expressway, he said.</p>
<p>Underwood noted that President Clinton's proposed 1998 budget calls for funding of the federal share of several major highway projects in West Virginia, including completion of Corridors H and G and the Parkersburg Bypass.</p>
<p>Underwood also advocated construction of the proposed regional airport between Charleston and Huntington.</p>
<p>In addition to making infrastructure improvements, Underwood urged lawmakers to adopt economic incentives to support the chemical industry and promote industries that would create finished products, such as furniture, from the state's natural resources.</p>
<p>&quot;We have all watched the trucks and freight cars loaded with our timber, our coal and our chemicals roll out of the state,&quot; Underwood said.</p>
<p>His budget would allocate an additional $9.95 million for Medicaid to offset federal reductions, and add $3.5 million to programs that enforce child support payments and fight welfare fraud. The latter would include a plan to make welfare payments via electronic transfer cards.</p>
<p>Underwood proposed raising higher education funding by $10 million, mostly to fund professor salary increases. That would be partly offset by merging Marshall University and the West Virginia College of Graduate Studies.</p>
<p>He also urged lawmakers to spend another $10 million to continue a program aimed at putting computers in all public school classrooms.</p>
