<p>China congratulated U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday for his election triumph, saying the victory presented a good opportunity to improve ties between Washington and Beijing.</p>
<p>Clinton's sweeping win over Republican rival Bob Dole is good news for a Beijing leadership which prefers to deal with familiar statesmen, Chinese academics and officials said.</p>
<p>&quot;We wish to congratulate President Clinton on his re-election,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai said.</p>
<p>&quot;Now, a good opportunity has presented itself for improving and expanding Sino-U.S. relations,&quot; Cui told reporters. &quot;Some positive progress has been made in bilateral relations, with a somewhat improved atmosphere.&quot;</p>
<p>China was ready to work with Washington for further progress on the basis of past Sino-U.S. joint agreements, he said.</p>
<p>While Clinton had presided over four years of Sino-U.S. ties often strained by disputes over trade, human rights, arms proliferation and Taiwan, his re-election could help stabilise relations, Chinese academics said.</p>
<p>&quot;The result should be a good thing for Sino-U.S. ties. After four years Clinton now understands China to a certain extent and there is some stability in his China policy,&quot; said one academic at a U.S.-funded election party in Beijing.</p>
<p>&quot;Another four years should allow some improvement in relations,&quot; said the specialist in international strategic studies, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>&quot;Clinton is an opponent we know well,&quot; said a government official at the reception, where invited U.S. and Chinese guests watched electoral results emerge over satellite television and real time Internet links.</p>
<p>&quot;It's like basketball: if the Chicago Bulls come to play the Beijing team and the two sides have never met before, it won't be a good game,&quot; said the official who declined to be named.</p>
<p>&quot;Neither side knows what the other can do,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Washington and Beijing both say ties have thawed since the two sides narrowly averted a trade war over copyright piracy and exchanged diplomatic fire over Taiwan earlier this year.</p>
<p>Cautious optimism was the tone taken by many of the Chinese specialists and officials at the reception in a Beijing hotel, where cola, hamburgers and live election coverage were served up by U.S. businesses keen to boost cross-Pacific understanding.</p>
<p>&quot;The Chinese leaders... like to deal with U.S. presidents whom they know personally,&quot; said Professor Xu Cunyao of the Ministry of Culture's Institute for Administrators' Education.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the Chinese leaders will be very happy with this result,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Despite the diplomatic spats of recent years, Sino-U.S. economic and trade ties had grown relatively fast during Clinton's tenure, Gu Yuanyang of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>&quot;We are all satisfied with this result because it will have a certain positive effect on the recovery and development of Sino-Chinese relations,&quot; said Gu, director of the academy's Institute of World Economics and Politics.</p>
<p>Relations would not improve automatically, he said, adding Clinton should push for high-level contacts, ensure China's trade status, smooth Beijing's entry to the World Trade Organisation and refrain from creating difficulties on Taiwan.</p>
