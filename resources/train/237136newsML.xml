<p>Swissair and KLM illegally flew suspected Nazis to safety in South America after the Second World War and Swiss officials may have given some of them false travel documents, a U.S. Senator said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato, who has been waging a war against Switzerland over its dealings with Nazi Germany, said the new charges were contained in documents discovered by his researchers in the U.S. National Archives.</p>
<p>The World Jewish Congress, which also has researchers combing the archives, released a document claiming that the German Army High Command in 1942 deposited one million Swiss francs in a Swiss bank that was withdrawn two years later by a Swiss citizen apparently acting as its agent.</p>
<p>D'Amato, who has been criticised by the Swiss for releasing unverifed documents that may contain false allegations, said the latest documents raised the possibility that &quot;Swiss government officals could have helped prepare false travel documents.&quot;</p>
<p>He was referring to a one-page secret document written in February 1948 by a U.S. army major quoting a Dutch businessman informant working in Switzerland as saying: &quot;The Swiss government was not only anxious to get rid of German nationals, legally or illegally within their borders, but further that they made a considerable profit in getting rid of them.&quot;</p>
<p>The informant, described as having excellent Swiss government contacts, alleged that Swiss officials charged as much as 20,000 Swiss francs for temporary residence documents needed before a person could be processed for &quot;transport via KLM to the Argentine.&quot;</p>
<p>Swissair acted as booking agent for KLM.</p>
<p>In another document released by the senator, the U.S. Embassy in the Hague told the Secretary of State that KLM Royal Dutch Airlines was transporting suspected Nazis to Argentina and objecting to providing passenger lists.</p>
<p>Other documents named Swissair, Air France and Air Sweden as either transporting suspected Nazis or acting as a booking agent for them.</p>
<p>The U.S. Ambassador in the Hague in 1948, Herman Baruch, said in a secret letter to a U.S. diplomat in Switerland: &quot;It is the embassy's belief that KLM wants this business (of transporting suspected Nazis) for purely commercial reasons, regardless of the type of persons being transported.&quot;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, D'Amato released documents alleging that Swiss bankers used their government's diplomatic pouches to carry Nazi money to Argentina during the war. The documents alleged that several top Nazis were able to deposit millions of dollars in Argentina using this method.</p>
<p>One document said that Hermann Goering, Hitler's Reichsmarshal, used diplomatic pouches to send more than $20 million of his &quot;personal fortune to Argentina.&quot;  Goering also transferred some funds to Argentina by a Nazi submarine in the summer of 1943, according to the document.</p>
<p>Swiss diplomat Thomas Borer, his country's main spokesman on the issue of Switzerland's wartime role, accused D'Amato on Thursday of using unverified documents and presenting them as facts. But he said he would investigate the charge that the Swiss allowed bankers to use diplomatic pouches during the war.</p>
