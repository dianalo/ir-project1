<p>Australia's Foreign Minister Alexander Downer on Monday criticised the unelected legislature which will be sworn in after Hong Kong reverts to China but said at least elections had been promised for next May.</p>
<p>The introduction of the pro-Beijing legislature on Tuesday was regrettable but Downer told a news conference: &quot;The important thing is the commitment to hold elections.&quot;</p>
<p>Australia has said that it will take part in the swearing-in ceremony of the new assembly.</p>
<p>Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy also said on Monday he would attend the swearing-in, refusing to join a Anglo-American ministerial boycott.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, along with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, plan to boycott the ceremony. Both Britain and the United States are sending diplomats.</p>
<p>Downer said on Sunday that the territory's future Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa had told him the first election for a legislature under Chinese rule would be next May.</p>
<p>&quot;What I want to see in Hong Kong is a continuation of its civil liberties, so let us wait and see whether civil liberties will be retained. My judgment is that demonstrations will be allowed, that the opportunity to demonstrate disapproval will be retained,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Downer said Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen had said he should come back in two years time and he would see that things were very much the same.</p>
<p>International human rights groups and Hong Kong democrats are pessimistic about the future of the territory after it reverts to China after 156 years of British colonial rule.</p>
<p>Downer said he and Qian had discussed the case of Australian businessman James Peng, jailed for 18 years in 1995 on charges of embezzlement. Peng has insisted the charges were trumped up by powerful business rivals.</p>
<p>&quot;I feel from my discussion that there is a political will to solve this problem but there are legal obstacles. I am committed to getting Peng deported to Australia and I do not think a great deal of publicity would help his case,&quot; Downer said.</p>
<p>Downer went on to say that the handover was a great event for Hong Kong and China, as well as for the whole Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 Australians live in Hong Kong, while around 90,000 people of Hong Kong origin live in Australia, and two-way trade between the two was valued at around $US 4 billion.</p>
<p>He defended China's plan to station almost 5,000 People's Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers in Hong Kong, saying the defence of Hong Kong clearly lies within China's sovereignty, and that the PLA would not have responsibility for internal security.</p>
