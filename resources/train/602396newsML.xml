<p>Indian call money ended Wednesday at 4.75-5.0 percent, down from Tuesday's closing quotes of 5.0-5.5 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said rates came down as demand had eased ahead of banks' reporting day on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Most banks have already covered their positions ahead of the reporting Friday,&quot; said a dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>The money market would be largely inactive on Thursday as banks in the commercial centre of Bombay and several other centres are closed for a holiday.</p>
<p>&quot;Liquidity is good and once demand eased, rates were bound to come down,&quot; the dealer said. &quot;Further, inflows of over 23 billion rupees through interest payments on government securities and redemption of maturing stocks are due before the end of the month.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the announcement of a bond auction for next week could affect call money rates in the next reporting fortnight.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) auctions 30 billion rupees of three-year federal government bonds on May 28.</p>
<p>&quot;Call money could open higher after the reporting Friday as market players discount outflows towards the bonds auction,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;But I don't think rates will go up much as inflows are also good.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said prices of government securities fell in light trade as some market players consolidated positions ahead of next week's auction.</p>
<p>&quot;Some market players seem to be selling as they want to switch to the new stock,&quot; said a dealer. &quot;Prices fell but volumes were moderate.&quot;</p>
<p>The 12.69 percent 2002 stock traded at 100.30 rupees against its last traded 100.42, the 13.12 percent 1999 dropped to 103 from 103.15 and the 13.40 percent 1999 to 104.45 from 104.75, dealers said.</p>
<p>Other securities which fell included the 13.70 percent 1999 to 104.7 from 104.99, the 13.85 percent 2000 to 105.45 from 105.65 and the 13.85 percent 2001 to 104.5 from 104.9.</p>
<p>Treasury bill maturing in April 1998 traded at a yield of 9.4 percent against 9.35, October 1997 bill traded at 8.5 percent and February 1998 bill at 9.17 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said a certificate of deposit maturing in August was traded in the secondary market at a yield of 10 percent.</p>
<p>Three-month commercial paper issued by a top-rated corporate was placed in the primary market at 9.85 percent, they said.</p>
