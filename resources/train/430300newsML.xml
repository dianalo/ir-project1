<p>Creditors of the Philippines' Victorias Milling Corp on Monday reached a consensus to draw up a &quot;restructuring plan&quot; to aid the cash-strapped firm, an official of a creditor bank said.</p>
<p>Representatives of the 32 creditors at a meeting formed a special committee to negotiate a bail-out plan for the country's largest sugar miller in talks starting on Tuesday. Victorias' oustanding debts total 4.423 billion pesos ($168 million).</p>
<p>&quot;There was a consensus to form a restructuring plan,&quot; said the official, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>An official of another creditor bank said the creditors had agreed to negotiate &quot;as a group.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;We hope to sit down with Victorias and try to look at its financial condition at the moment,&quot; said the official.</p>
<p>The creditors, who include banks and investment houses, last week agreed in principle to grant a 90-day moratorium on principal repayments of Victorias's debts.</p>
<p>Land Bank of the Philippines, Philippine Commercial International Bank and the Bank of the Philippine Islands have been appointed to represent &quot;secured creditors&quot; - or creditors who had collaterals on their loans to Victorias - in Tuesday's talks, said the bank officials, requesting anonymity.</p>
<p>Development Bank of the Philippines and the Philippine Savings Bank will represent the so-called &quot;unsecured creditors,&quot; or those without collaterals, they said.</p>
<p>Asian Bank Corp will represent the small creditors while Deutsche Bank has been appointed to represent the foreign creditors, they added.</p>
<p>Victorias asked for a 90-day debt moratorium from creditors to improve its cash-flow. The firm blamed the steep drop in sugar prices to 480 pesos three months ago from 800 pesos at the start of 1996 to a glut because of what it said was over-importation from neighbouring countries.</p>
<p>The firm hopes to get a partner to infuse up to two billion pesos for a 35 to 40 percent stake to aid its recovery.</p>
