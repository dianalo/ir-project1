<headline>Israeli shares end lower after high CPI.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-04-16</dateline>

<p>Israeli shares closed lower on Wednesday in dull trading following the release of a higher than expected March consumer price index (CPI), traders said.</p>
<p>The CPI, released on Tuesday after the end of the trading day, rose 1.0 percent. The figure was above analysts' expectations of a 0.7-0.8 percent rise.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares fell 1.04 percent, or 2.66 points, to 254.29 on an all-share turnover of 86 million shekels against 120 million shekels on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index closed 0.98 percent lower at 263.96.</p>
<p>&quot;The market rose for several days on hopes of a relatively low CPI that will lead to a rate cut. Now, the Bank of Israel is expected to leave its key rate unchanged and this affected the market in a negative way,&quot; said a trader at Tachlit Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;We were expecting a sharper decline in shares following the release of the disappointing inflation figure. The market has been showing strength recently and it did not decline in reaction to negative political developments and Wall Street losses,&quot; said Idan Azoulay at Impact Union Protfolio Management.</p>
<p>Traders said media reports that police had recommended corruption charges against men close to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not have a real impact on the market.</p>
<p>&quot;The fact that the market is declining on relatively low volume is an indication that the market is still strong,&quot; Azoulay added.</p>
<p>The Tachlit trader said the reaction to the CPI was very moderate. &quot;Investors are still waiting for further developments. There are more talks about the possibility of a package deal including a one billion shekel budget cut and a reduction of interest rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Talks on Tuesday night between Netanyahu, Finance Minister Dan Meridor and Bank of Israel Governor Jacob Frenkel failed to yield any decisions concerning the government budget deficit.</p>
<p>Officials present at the meeting said the three agreed to continue talks. Treasury officials want to tie spending cuts to an agreement that the central bank will lower interest rates to boost the slowing economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if the Treasury agrees to another budget cut I am not sure that Frenkel will lower the rate,&quot; Azoulay said.</p>
<p>The most active shares were Israel Discount Bank, which fell 2.5 percent to 340 agorot on volume of 19.3 million shekels; Koor Industries, which gained 0.25 percent to 30,649 agorot on turnover of 7.2 million shekels; and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which lost 0.5 percent to 18,740 agorot on volume of 2.8 million shekels.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.4 shekels)</p>
