<p>South Korea faces a year-end political drama on Monday as former presidents Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae-woo prepare final appeals against convictions and the ruling party attempts to push through two controversial laws.</p>
<p>Chun and Roh are expected to meet a deadline on Monday to take their challenges against convictions for mutiny, treason and bribery to the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Last Monday an appeals court upheld guilty verdicts, but commuted Chun's death sentence to life in jail and slashed Roh's jail term to 17 years from 22-1/2 years.</p>
<p>The sentences relate to a 1979 coup, a massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators that followed in the city of Kwangju and huge slush funds the former presidents amassed in office.</p>
<p>One business tycoon and six former aides and military subordinates of Chun and Roh, convicted with the one-time heads of state, have already filed appeals.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, parliament meets in an extraordinary session during which the ruling New Korea Party will try to complete its legislative agenda for the year -- passage of a labour law and new national security law.</p>
<p>An official at the spokesman's office of the ruling party said on Sunday the labour law was likely to slide through after back-room bargaining among all parties.</p>
<p>But opposition groups have vowed to block passage of the security law -- using physical force if necessary.</p>
<p>Labour unions have threatened general strikes if the National Assembly adopts a labour law that challenges decades of job security by allowing layoffs and flexible work hours.</p>
<p>Potentially as explosive is a new national security law reviving powers of the National Security Planning Agency, the Korean version of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) once notorious for torturing political dissidents under military-backed rule.</p>
<p>President Kim Young-sam, himself a former dissident, was elected to office on a pledge to scrap the law. But after weakening the investigative powers of the secretive agency he now believes South Korea has dropped its guard against the threat from communist North Korea.</p>
<p>Hardline proponents of the bill say South Korea is threatened by pro-Pyongyang student radicals and spies. Fears of subversion reached fever pitch after a North Korean submarine intruded in September.</p>
<p>Leading the emotional charge against the law is Kim Dae-jung, the most prominent victim of the agency that is believed to have organised his kidnapping and planned his assassination in 1973.</p>
<p>Kim Dae-jung heads the main opposition National Congress for New Politics and is preparing a bid for the presidency in elections due next December.</p>
<p>Among those who have appealed sentences imposed during the &quot;trial of the century&quot; involving Chun and Roh is the chairman of the Dong-Ah Group, Choi Won-suk, who was handed a suspended jail term by the appeals court.</p>
<p>Others appealing are former legislator Lee Won-jo and five one-time generals convicted over the 1980 Kwangju massacre in which hundreds of protesters were shot and clubbed to death.</p>
<p>Domestic media reports said the chairman of the Daewoo Group, Kim Woo-choong, is expected to challenge his suspended prison sentence.</p>
