<p>Russia has imported 730 tonnes of British beef subject to a worldwide ban because of mad cow disease, Interfax news agency quoted Russia's agriculture minister as saying on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;The situation is extremely serious,&quot; Viktor Khlystun told a news conference. He did not give a precise date for the import of the beef, which he said came via Belgium, nor did he say to where in Russia it was delivered.</p>
<p>According to Interfax, he declined to say whether the meat had already gone on sale.</p>
<p>The announcement marked the first time the Russian government has recognised the imports of large quantities of banned beef. Officially, Russia has not imported British beef since 1990.</p>
<p>The European Commission said last week that 1,600 tonnes of British beef had been illegally exported to the Netherlands, Russia and Egypt through Belgium,</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency quoted a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry as saying on Thursday it was &quot;practially impossible&quot; to import poor quality meat into Russia legally. But the agriculture ministry said it could not block all illegal channels.</p>
<p>&quot;Preventing the import of contaminated meat is in principle impossible, although we have mobilised frontier guards and veterinary services. There is no legal or moral ground for banning beef imports from Belgium,&quot; Interfax quoted Khlystun as saying.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no 100 percent guarantee that Russian importers will not import one or more cargo of British beef,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Even if we checked every car crossing the border, it is not possible to prevent (such imports), insofar as there is no way to diagnose bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).&quot;</p>
<p>German authorities this week seized an unspecified quantity of beef imported from Belgium which they believed came illegally from Britain.</p>
<p>They say this cargo was heading for Russia via Germany. BSE, or mad cow disease, has been linked to a handful of deaths in Britain from Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease among people believed infected by eating beef.</p>
