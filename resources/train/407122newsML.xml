<p>Around 50 people tread on land mines in Bosnia every month and between five and 15 of them die from their injuries, the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Experts estimate there are around six million mines left in Bosnia from a war that ended with a U.S-brokered ceasefire in October 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;Exact figures are irrelevant, but there are as many mines as there are Bosnians,&quot; Nina Winquist of the ICRC said.</p>
<p>The country has fewer mines than Afghanistan or Cambodia, but is more contaminated per square metre because it is smaller, she said.</p>
<p>The most frequent victims are farmers and manual labourers around Banja Luka in the northwest and Tuzla in the northeast. A fifth of the victims are children, and the number is expected to rise this year.</p>
<p>The ICRC conducted a study of mine injuries for 1996 and Winquist said they expected mine accidents to soar in 1997, especially during the farming seasons.</p>
<p>&quot;In 1996 war memories were still fresh and we think this will gradually change,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Children will be more difficult to control because their memories of war fade fastest and injuries are likely to increase if refugees start trickling across former front lines.</p>
<p>The responsibility to clear mines lies with Bosnia's former warring factions, but only about half of the minefields have been reported and marked, experts in Sarajevo said.</p>
<p>The ICRC has tried to raise mine-awareness through media adverts and posters and will start an education programme in schools across Bosnia in March.</p>
<p>&quot;We feel that we have a lot of work to do in terms of convincing the parties to stop mining, especially in abandoned houses in the Zone of Separation,&quot; Winquist said.</p>
<p>The zone is a two km wide strip along the former front line between the Serb republic and Moslem-Croat federation. It has often been the scene of night-time explosions in houses, aimed at discouraging refugees from returning.</p>
