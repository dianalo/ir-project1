<p>The battle for the takeover of Ivory Coast's telephone company CI-TELCOM took a dramatic turn on Thursday when local consortium Africa Bell, which chose U.S. telecommunications giant AT&amp;T as one of its partners, was disqualified from bidding.</p>
<p>&quot;The decision to disqualify Africa Bell was taken by the Privatisation Committee,&quot; committee president Jean-Claude Brou told reporters, adding: &quot;Africa Bell had not demonstrated technical or financial capacity.&quot;</p>
<p>During a round of bidding on December 17 when France Telecom and Telekom Malaysia also made offers, Brou said that Africa Bell had not yet acquired a reputable technical partner.</p>
<p>&quot;Africa Bell also wrote at the time to say its financial plan had not yet been concluded,&quot; Brou added.</p>
<p>A partner in Africa Bell, founded by Ivorian interests, announced on Monday that AT&amp;T had since given a firm commitment to take a 35 percent stake and make its technical expertise available to the consortium.</p>
<p>The elimination of Africa Bell, announced at a final round of bidding, leaves the French and the Malaysians as the only contenders for a 51-percent strategic stake in CI-TELCOM.</p>
<p>France Telecom, bidding through a local consortium led by its subsidiary, France Cable Radio, this time offered 105 billion CFA francs ($198 million) for the 204,000 shares on sale, an improvement of two billion CFA on its previous bid.</p>
<p>It also repeated an offer to pay off 40 billion CFA of CI-TELCOM's debt over 10 years and to finance the network with a 25 billion CFA loan it was arranging through institutional partners in Africa and Europe.</p>
<p>Telekom Malaysia made a significant increase in its previous offer of 82.4 billion CFA for the shares, raising it to 104 billion CFA. Like the French, the Malaysians agreed to recapitalise 51 percent of CI-TELCOM.</p>
<p>France Telecom is counting on its long association with Ivory Coast, a former French colony, where the French network is a major supplier, technical partner and creditor.</p>
<p>The local consortium through which it bid includes diversified group SIFCOM, the largest private company in Ivory Coast with interests ranging from commodities to car dealerships and duty-free shops.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a long time since we've been here trying to help with the development of the country. It's an occasion we shouldn't miss,&quot; said France Cable Radio's Pierre Godiniaux.</p>
<p>The Malaysians for their part hope to impress with their experience in running the privatised telephone company in Guinea for which they paid $45 million last Decemeber. Telekom Malaysia also looks on course to clinch the deal to run Ghana'a state telephone network, industry officials say.</p>
<p>Although it is yet to find a local partner as required by Ivorian authorities, it says one will be found within a permitted period of about two years.</p>
<p>&quot;In terms of local partners and financing for network development, we will fulfil our conditions as required,&quot; said Michael Grossman, corporate finance manager of the Ivorian unit of Citibank, lead manager for Telekom Malaysia.</p>
<p>The winner of the bid, expected to be known in about a week, will take a 51 to 55 percent stake in CI-TELCOM, the state will retain 35 percent, eight to 10 percent will be sold to Ivorian shareholders on the Abidjan stock exchange and staff will be offered one to two percent.</p>
