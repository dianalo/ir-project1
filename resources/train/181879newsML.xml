<title>UK: Closing stock market indices.</title>
<headline>Closing stock market indices.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Tuesday.</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE 100 continued to reclaim some of the ground lost in recent weeks, but traders and strategists say further gains are likely to be limited until the British budget is released Nov. 26. Buoyed by a firm bond market and a strong performance on Wall Street overnight, the British benchmark blue-chip index climbed 19.9 points to close at 3,934.3.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German stocks ended market trade slightly firmer as the dollar stablized, supported by Monday's record close on Wall Street and strength of German government bonds. The 30-share DAX closed up 5.98 points at 2,734.30 points. In after-hours trade, the index was up 33.86 at 2.764.30.</p>
<p>PARIS - Merger fever and comments on the dollar from a Bundesbank official seen as benign for the franc hustled the market to a year high. The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 23.93 points, or 1.09 percent, at 2,229.13.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares ended mixed as a weaker beginning on Wall Street dampened sentiment, but the blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) was still able to finish at a new closing high. The All-share SPI ended down .14 point at 2,445.72 points.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks ended on a firm note Tuesday, cheered on by the bull run on Wall Street and strong U.S. semiconductor data. Analysts added that the market was also supported psychologically by signs that the domestic economy was not really as feeble as thought by some. The key Nikkei 225 closed up 141.35 points, or 0.67 percent, at 21,206.43.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong's Hang Seng index squeaked to a new record close Tuesday after a mixed session buoyed by late European interest. The Hang Seng index closed 34.45 points higher at 12,806.31.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian stocks closed lower Tuesday, their early slide accelerating in the afternoon as the resource leaders ran into selling from offshore investors. The All Ordinaries index lost 14.6 points to close at 2,343.5.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African shares bounced to firmer levels, finishing in positive territory for the first time in nine sessions. The all-share index climbed 29.4 points to 6,762.1, the industrial index gained 38.3 to 7,930.2, and gold stocks rose 22.4 to 1,701.6.</p>
