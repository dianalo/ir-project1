<headline>US and European bourses progress, dollar mixed.</headline>

<text>
<p>Wall Street and European bourses made progress on Wednesday, putting aside their worries over future prospects for now.</p>
<p>The New York stock market, the world's largest, had rebounded on Tuesday after U.S. interest rates were held steady and it rose a further 0.6 percent in morning business Wednesday, aided by higher bond prices.</p>
<p>Strength in shares of computer giant IBM and other recently shaky high technology stocks provided support.</p>
<p>On the foreign exchanges, the pound took centre stage, gaining ground after news of a 95,800 drop in British unemployment last month -- the biggest fall on record.</p>
<p>The dollar was boosted against the mark after a slowdown in German money supply growth left faint hopes for a cut in the key German money rate. But it was weaker against the yen after the first rise in Japan's trade surplus for two years.</p>
<p>Share trading in London, Europe's busiest stock market, was spiced with a little takeover bid speculation after news of an agreed 1.267 billion pound ($2.1 billion) bid by U.S. group Entergy for London Electricity.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of key British shares gained 38.6 points to 4,018.2, topping 4,000 for the first time in five days.</p>
<p>Activity quickened despite the proximity of Christmas holidays, although most fund managers had seemed ready to wait until the New Year before rejigging portfolios, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The bid this morning created thoughts of more money coming into the system,&quot; said one trader. &quot;Coupled with Wall Street it was good enough to give us the momentum to get up to 4,000.&quot;</p>
<p>London shares shrugged off news that British November unemployment fell 95,800 to 1.93 million and retail sales rose 0.7 percent rather than a forecast 0.5 -- strong data that spurred fears of higher interest rates. This did, however, jolt the bond market although it later recovered.</p>
<p>&quot;(It is) very strong data which will certainly increase pressure on the Chancellor(of Exchequer Kenneth Clarke) to increase rates,&quot; said Andrew Snowball, economist at the Cooperative Bank.</p>
<p>French shares held on to their gains to close higher, aided by strength on Wall Street, and traders were moderately optimistic about further gains.</p>
<p>German stocks ended bourse dealings with modest gains, also encouraged by Wall Street, a firmer dollar -- good news for exporters -- and weaker-than-expected German money supply data.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank said growth in its main monetary policy indicator, M3 money supply, slowed to an annualised rate of 8.0 percent in November from 8.4 percent in October.</p>
<p>Few analysts expect a German interest rate cut just now but they said the Bundesbank might shave rates as it often fixes its key repo rate over the year-end holiday period and could do so at a slightly lower rate than the current 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>Currency markets, pondering the chances of a surprise move by the German central bank, boosted the dollar against the mark.</p>
<p>&quot;The M3 data was just soft enough to keep interest in Thursday's meeting alive,&quot; said one trader at a British bank.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank central council meets for the last time this year on Thursday and is set to announce its 1997 M3 growth targets at a news conference afterwards.</p>
<p>&quot;I'd be very surprised (if the Bundesbank cut). The only thing that gives you a slight nag is the fact we've had France and a couple of other countries move. It has been suggested that perhaps there are some concerted ideas around,&quot; said Peter Wood, trader at Bank of Boston.</p>
<p>The Bank of France trimmed its key intervention rate to 3.15 percent from 3.20 on Tuesday, since then French call money has eased to 3-3/16 5/16 from 3-1/4 3/8, giving hope of more rate reductions, analysts said.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT THE EUROPEAN CLOSE</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 1.5543 marks and 113.62 yen, compared with 1.5454 and 113.73 in late business on Monday.</p>
<p>The pound rallied to 2.6002 marks from 2.5845.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT THE EUROPEAN CLOSE</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 index ended 38.6 points higher at 4,018.2.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX ended floor trade up 5.62 at 2,820.75 but slipped to 2,814.23 in later electronic business. In Paris, the CAC-40 share index finished up 25.19 at 2,218.89.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold ended London trading at $369.10 after an afternoon fix of $368.70 and a previous close of $368.95. Silver was one cent lower at $4.86.</p>
