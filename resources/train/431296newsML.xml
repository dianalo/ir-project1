<headline>FBI looking for 3rd man in Oklahoma bombing - Time.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>The FBI is hunting for a third man in the Oklahoma City bombing case, Time magazine reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The weekly magazine, which investigated the story with CNN's newsmagazine programme Impact, identified him as Robert Jacques, a muscular young man with a short haircut and dark features whom FBI agents have been seeking for over a year.</p>
<p>The FBI is not ready to classify Jacques as a suspect or target in its investigations, but does want to question him as part of its attempt to reconstruct the activities of prime suspects Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, Time said.</p>
<p>The FBI built a portrait of Jacques with information obtained from a real estate agent from the Ozark mountains, William Maloney, who said he met Jacques with McVeigh and Nichols several months before the April 19, 1995, bombing.</p>
<p>The three men drove up to Maloney's office in Cassville, Missouri, in late 1994. Jacques did all the talking and seemed to be in charge, Maloney told Time. Maloney asked them if they were looking for a place to hide, but got no answer. The trio left the same day and never returned.</p>
<p>McVeigh is scheduled to go on trial in Denver on March 31 for the attack on the Alfred P. Murrah federal office building in downtown Oklahoma City in which 168 people were killed.</p>
<p>The FBI is still looking for a man who may have been with McVeigh when he allegedly rented the truck that carried the powerful fertiliser and fuel oil bomb.</p>
