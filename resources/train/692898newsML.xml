<p>President Clinton exulted Thursday over the Supreme Court's dismissal of a challenge to his line-item veto powers.</p>
<p>But he said that he would have to study questions raised by a court decision on religious freedom and that he would make a &quot;counteroffer&quot; to a ruling on indecency on the Internet.</p>
<p>Amplifying earlier official statements put out by the White House, Clinton gave a thumbs up to the ruling Thursday that turned back a congressional challenge to a law that permits the president to veto specific items from spending and tax legislation.</p>
<p>At the end of a grueling day that Clinton acknowledged left him spent, he turned aside a question on whether he had in mind any provisions on which to exercise his special new line-item veto power.</p>
<p>Instead, he replied, &quot;My experience as governor (of Arkansas) with that (the line-item veto) is that the existence of it is more important than the use of it.&quot;</p>
<p>The law took effect in January, but Clinton has yet to use the veto, and a U.S. District Court judge struck the law down as unconstitutional. On Thursday the high court ruled that six members of Congress who sued in challenging the line-item veto law lacked the legal standing or right to bring the case in the first place.</p>
<p>Clinton, himself a lawyer and a former professor of constitutional law, said he did not fully understand a ruling the Supreme Court made Wednesday striking down the 1993 Religious Freedom Restoration Act. That act said that the government must show a compelling interest before it could apply general laws against religion.</p>
<p>&quot;We're going to have to assess where we are and what we're going to do on it,&quot; Clinton said of the religion ruling. &quot;I'm going to have to read the opinion.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked about a second Thursday ruling that struck down parts of the so-called Communications Decency Act, which aimed to curtail transmission of obscenity on the Internet, Clinton said, &quot;We'll have a counter-offer.&quot; He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>In an earlier White House statement, Clinton said he would convene industry leaders and groups representing teachers, parents and librarians. That meeting could come as early as next Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;We can and must develop a solution for the Internet that is as powerful for the computer as the V-chip will be for television, and that protects children in ways that are consistent with America's free speech values,&quot; the statement said.</p>
<p>The V-chip is a computer chip that, in conjunction with a voluntary ratings system devised by the television industry, would allow parents to screen out programs they do not want their children to watch.</p>
<p>In a brief but relaxed discussion with reporters, Clinton admitted being tired at the end of a two-day trip that included stops in Nashville, Chicago and his boyhood hometown of Hope, Arkansas, where he attended the funeral of his great-uncle Henry Oren Grisham. His tour ended in New York with a speech at the United Nations Earth Summit.</p>
<p>He said he felt revitalized after visiting Hope, where he met with family and friends.</p>
