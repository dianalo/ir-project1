<p>The quaint nickname of the weather phenomenon &quot;El Nino&quot;, given by Peruvian fishermen after the baby Jesus because it tends to arrive at Christmas, belies the chaos it brings to economically vulnerable Latin America.</p>
<p>El Nino's already developing freak wind patterns and overheating of the Pacific Ocean threaten to produce a trail of havoc well into 1998 from flooding, droughts and disrupted agriculture and fishing patterns throughout the region.</p>
<p>&quot;From the evidence so far, there's no way that this couldn't continue to develop and be a major El Nino,&quot; said Michael Halpert, a research meteorologist at the U.S. government's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's climate prediction centre.</p>
<p>&quot;I am sure that it can have devastating impacts, which is why we are trying to forecast it as accurately as possible and urge governments to get prepared,&quot; he added in a telephone interview from Washington.</p>
<p>El Nino will swell to its peak towards the end of 1997 and in the first half of 1998, with the worst affected countries likely to be Peru and Chile, on South America's Pacific coast.</p>
<p>Its impact will, however, be felt the length of the continent -- from increased storms off western Mexico to abnormal rainfall in Argentina. And the possibility of billions of dollars of damage is worrying governments, investors and populace alike.</p>
<p>CHILE THE FIRST MAJOR VICTIM</p>
<p>Sparked by a mysterious disruption in the atmospheric system which changes wind patterns and water temperatures in the tropical Pacific, El Nino occurs with varying strength every two to seven years and lasts up to 18 months.</p>
<p>Its effects are already being felt.</p>
<p>Most dramatically, in Chile, El Nino was blamed in June for the nation's worst flooding in a decade that killed 17 people, forced 60,000 to flee their homes and seriously damaged agriculture and infrastructure.</p>
<p>Santiago, the capital, was drenched by more than 300 mm of rainfall in a month -- more than usually falls in a year -- while parts of northern Chile, which is mainly desert, received more rain in one month than normally falls in 30 years.</p>
<p>Worse is likely in July and August. &quot;We expect much more extreme events in coming months than we saw in June. Rains will be heavier than normal,&quot; said meteorologist Juan Quintana, of the National Meteorological Service in Santiago.</p>
<p>But it wasn't all bad news for Chile. As President Eduardo Frei announced a $165 million plan to repair flood-damage, Finance Minister Eduardo Aninat said that, far from harming the economy, renovation work should stimulate growth in the construction sector.</p>
<p>And local fishermen are rubbing their hands in glee at the prospect of higher catches as fish migrate south from Peru looking for cooler waters.</p>
<p>THIS YEAR COULD EQUAL WORST OF THE CENTURY</p>
<p>Already international scientists are comparing this year with notorious Ninos in 1957-1958 and 1972-1973 and say it could rival the worst this century in 1982-1983, which caused billions of dollars of damage worldwide.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a big event,&quot; said Ants Leetma, director of the U.S. climate prediction centre.</p>
<p>Latin America's worst-hit country in the 1982-83 apparition was Peru, where hundreds died in floods and landslides, tens of thousands were left homeless and damage contributed to a 12 percent economic downturn.</p>
<p>Already in Peru this year, the warmer sea has brought an Indian summer on the coast and begun to harm the nation's second most important industry, fishing, while unusually cold temperatures in the Andes have killed scores of children.</p>
<p>Anticipating heavy flooding in the north and droughts in the south, President Alberto Fujimori has declared nine of Peru's 24 regions in a state of emergency and earmarked $19 million for anti-Nino preparations.</p>
<p>PHENOMENON WILL HIT LENGTH OF LATIN AMERICA</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Latin America, Mexico is bracing for more storms on its Pacific coast, which could affect tourist resorts and shipping sites for crude oil, grains and other products.</p>
<p>Central America is unlikely to be hard hit, although Panama's narrow isthmus has already experienced droughts on the Pacific side and flooding on the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Colombia, heavily dependent on energy from hydro-electric generators, is reporting a four degree centigrade temperature rise off its Pacific coast that could spark a severe drought from February next year.</p>
<p>When El Nino last hit in 1992, energy was rationed for a year in Colombia, with homes and businesses losing supplies for up to eight hours a day.</p>
<p>Despite the discomfort, though, many Colombians remember the experience fondly.</p>
<p>&quot;People used to meet up in their homes to play cards or tell stories. It was good for family solidarity. It brought people back together again,&quot; a Colombian journalist said. Others recounted how shopping malls, with their own generators, became magnets for residents without electricity.</p>
<p>Colombia's coffee-growing regions are expected to experience a significant drop in rainfall, but this is not seen affecting the crop.</p>
<p>&quot;Paradoxically El Nino could be good for coffee because flowering periods are better when dry spells are longer,&quot; said agroclimatologist Orlando Guzman, of Colombia's National Centre for Coffee Research (Cenicafe).</p>
<p>ECUADOR ON ALERT</p>
<p>Like Peru and Chile, Ecuador's government has put the country on alert and announced plans to spend an initial minimum $7.5 million in prevention work.</p>
<p>&quot;El Nino is imminent,&quot; said Public Works Minister Homero Torres. &quot;We are preparing to carry out maintenance and repair work in the highways, control drainage and sewage systems, strengthening of bridges, build walls to support roads, and clean irrigation channels.&quot;</p>
<p>Ecuador, which suffered an estimated $640 million  damage from El Nino in 1982-83, is also anticipating damage to crops such as rice, maize, sugar, soya and cocoa. &quot;The effects are unpredictable, uncontrollable and unmeasurable. We cannot anticipate what strength it is going to be,&quot; said a worried Raul Morales, executive director of the Agriculture Chamber.</p>
<p>LESS DAMAGE EXPECTED IN BRAZIL AND ARGENTINA</p>
<p>Further south, in the larger economies of Brazil and Argentina, disruption is also expected but on a smaller scale.</p>
<p>Brazil anticipates higher rainfall in the south and drought in the northeast from El Nino. Its last appearance there in 1991-1992 burst river banks, killing about 30 people and forcing 100,000 to abandon their homes, and also reduced the northeast region's sugarcane harvest.</p>
<p>This time, the phenomenon has already brought unseasonal rains to the south, followed by an Indian summer. The extra rains, expected to return to the south in September, may have an impact on one of Brazil's key commodities -- coffee.</p>
<p>Argentina is likely to see heavier rain in the River Plate Basin and more snow in the Andes, but does not expect widespread damage.</p>
<p>COUNTRIES SEEN BETTER PREPARED</p>
<p>Investors in Latin America are gradually waking up to El Nino and its possible effect on economic growth this year and next, but there is no panic yet.</p>
<p>Rather, they are trusting that recent experiences of El Nino, the stronger state of the region's economies, better forecasting and early preparations will minimize the impact.</p>
<p>&quot;I think there is a growing concern in the markets about El Nino. It is just starting to get across people's radar screens,&quot; said William Romary, senior Latin American economist for UBS Securities.</p>
<p>&quot;But it is very hard to judge the economic impact until we know in August, September just how bad it is going to be.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts say the effects of El Nino could knock half to one percentage point off the gross domestic product (GDP) growth of the worst affected countries, like Peru and Chile.</p>
<p>&quot;But I don't expect it to affect the overall growth rate of the region, as Chile and Peru have relatively small economies compared to Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, which will remain largely unaffected,&quot; Romary said.</p>
