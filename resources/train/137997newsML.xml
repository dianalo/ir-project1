<p>Syria's official media said on Wednesday that Israel's obstruction of French President Jacques Chirac's visit to Arab East Jerusalem was a &quot;deliberate provocation&quot; because he supports Arab rights.</p>
<p>&quot;The Israeli government allowed television screens in the world to show part of its ugly and condemned practices. The target this time was President Chirac who came to the region on a noble mission to revive the peace process,&quot; the Tishreen daily said.</p>
<p>&quot;Because Chirac came to the region to urge Israel's rulers to adhere to the land-for-peace principle and the basis of the peace process, he was met with deliberate provocation by the Israeli leaders,&quot; Tishreen said in an attack that was echoed by all official newspapers.</p>
<p>Chirac, in Israel on a regional tour, was furious when Israeli security forces on Tuesday prevented him meeting Arabs during a visit to Jerusalem's Old City, captured by Israel in 1967.</p>
<p>A red-faced Chirac, teeth clenched and elbows flailing, snapped at Israeli guards surrounding him to leave but was ignored. Israel later apologised, saying it had been trying to protect him.</p>
<p>&quot;The government of (Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin) Netanyahu insisted on the security measures and ordered the army and police to hassle the French president,&quot; Tishreen said.</p>
<p>&quot;The reason is known,&quot; the paper said, adding that Chirac's call for just and comprehensive Middle East peace based on the exchange of occupied Arab land for peace did not please Netanyahu.</p>
<p>In contrast, the French president was earlier given a hero's welcome in Damascus. Syria also backed his call for a greater European role in the faltering Arab-Israeli peace talks.</p>
<p>The Syrian newspapers said Israel objected to Chirac's call for Israel to return the Golan Heights captured from Syria in 1967 and to end its occupation of a strip of southern Lebanon.</p>
<p>Syria had held sporadic peace talks with Israel since 1991 but there have been none since Netanyahu came to power in June. Netanyahu rules out a return of the Golan and this week rejected Chirac's call for a larger European role in peace talks.</p>
<p>&quot;The Israeli rejection of a European role is due to the fact that the Tel Aviv leaders could not blackmail Europe as they do with the U.S.. That is why the Israelis deliberately placed obstacles against Chirac's mission,&quot; Tishreen said.</p>
