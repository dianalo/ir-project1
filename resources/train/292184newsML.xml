<headline>CU down on profit taking, Hoare downgrade.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in Commercial Union Plc dropped on Tuesday amid profit-taking after its recent gains and as some investors switched into Legal and General Plc amid renewed bid speculation, dealers said.</p>
<p>Separately, analysts at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett lowered estimates for net asset values across the composite insurance sector and lowered their recommendations on a number of stocks in the sector, market sources said.  </p>
<p>Shares in CU, which set an 11-month high of 699p at the end of December, were down 9p at 674-1/2 by 0901 GMT while Legal &amp; General gained 8p to 384-1/2.</p>
<p>Dealers said buying of L&amp;G shares late yesterday had continued today, helping rekindle the bid speculation that has surrounded the stock for some months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile a report in the Financial Times that General Accident Plc was considering an acquisition to boost its sales of life assurance, pensions and investment products also helped renew bid talk in the sector, traders said.</p>
<p>GA shares were up 1p at 738-1/2.  </p>
<p>The FT reported Peter Hales, GA's assistant general manager, as saying GA Life aimed to double new premium income through the next three years and that the company would consider an acquisition to help it achieve that target.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the report had helped switch the focus of bid speculation back to Legal &amp; General.</p>
<p>Separately Hoare Govett lowered its recommendation on Commercial Union to &quot;hold&quot; from &quot;undervalued&quot; though market sources said the stock was not seen by analysts at the brokerage as a major bear story in the sector.</p>
<p>Analysts at Hoare Govett also cut Guardian Royal Exchange Plc to &quot;overvalued&quot; from &quot;buy,&quot; sources said, though analysts at Hoare were not immediately available for comment.</p>
