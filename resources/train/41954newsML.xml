<title>USA: Couple die in flooding outside Philadelphia.</title>

<p>A couple in suburban Abington township north of Philadelphia drowned when rapidly rising flood waters trapped them in their basement on Sunday, authorities said on Monday.</p>
<p>Abington Township manager Burton Conway said 12 homes in the Roslyn section along Sandy Run Creek were evacuated during the evening when the deaths were discovered. Authorities did not identify the couple.</p>
<p>&quot;We have one unofficial estimate that 10 inches (25 cm) of rain fell on us in little more than an hour&quot; Sunday evening, Conway said. The rainful was part of a line of thunderstorms that marched through the northern Philadelphia suburbs and into central New Jersey.</p>
<p>They were a product of Hurricane Fran, which pumped humid tropical air into the area and triggered a storm front that stalled overhead. Tornado-like winds were reported in Chester County, Penn., and Middlesex County, N.J. Hardest hit were Abington and nearby Montgomery County.</p>
<p>At its peak, the storm knocked out electricity service to 90,000 Philadelphia Electric Co. customers but crews worked overnight to restore service to 70,000 by Monday morning, a spokesman said. All service should be restored by day's end.</p>
