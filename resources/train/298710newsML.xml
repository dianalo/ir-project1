<title>UK: UK questions EC ban on sale of airport runway slot.</title>
<headline>UK questions EC ban on sale of airport runway slot.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain said on Friday it did not agree with the European Commission that European Union rules necessarily prevent airlines selling takeoff and landing slots at overcrowded airports such as London Heathrow.</p>
<p>&quot;We are fully aware of the EC's belief that the slot allocation regulation does not endorse slot trading but the regulation is silent on the matter,&quot; a spokesman for Britain's Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said. &quot;It (the EU regulation) does not go either way.&quot;  </p>
<p>The European Commission said earlier it was advising Britain that under EU legislation British Airways and American Airlines could not sell off the Heathrow slots that they are being asked by Britain to release to rivals as a condition for approving their alliance.</p>
<p>But the DTI said it was not yet decided whether BA and American must surrender or should be allowed to sell the slots.</p>
<p>Trade and industry minister Ian Lang proposed in December that the companies should release a total of 168 weekly slots but asked for other airlines to comment on the proposals to his Office of Fair Trading (OFT) by the end of today, January 10.  </p>
<p>&quot;We are not saying that we are telling BA and American to sell them and we are not saying we are telling them to give them away,&quot; said the DTI spokesman.</p>
<p>&quot;We are saying the matter is open to consultation and for third-party views. That consultation ends today and it will then be for the OFT to report to the DTI on the responses that have been received.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Under the consultation process the EC is just as welcome to submit evidence as any other interested body.&quot;</p>
<p>Quoting from EU Council Regulations 95 Article 8 he said the EU rule simply stated that slots could be &quot;freely exchanged between air carriers or transferred by an air carrier from one route or type of service to another by mutual agreement or as a result of a total or partial takeover, or unilaterally.&quot;</p>
<p>BA says it should not be forced to give up slots, and any that are given up should be acquired by rivals &quot;for a fair value.&quot;</p>
