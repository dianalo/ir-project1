<p>Private Japanese investors may adopt a more cautious stance about investing in U.S. Treasuries and other foreign bonds due to fears of a possible slowing of the rise in the dollar, underwriters said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said investors are starting to worry that the pace of the dollar's rise may not be as rapid as it has been over the past two years, even after the recent Group of Seven (G7) meeting failed to make a specific reference to yen weakness as a shared concern.</p>
<p>&quot;Individual investors are becoming more cautious about extending their foreign investments, as they are not expecting the dollar to climb extensively like it has in the last two years,&quot; a senior underwriter at a major brokerage said.</p>
<p>The G7 communique stressed the need to avoid currency rates that spur trade imbalances, which indirectly referred to the yen and Japan's rising trade surplus, currency traders said.</p>
<p>The G7 also said its members will cooperate as appropriate in foreign exchange markets.</p>
<p>Retail investors, seeking high returns at a time of low interest rates in Japan, have been comfortably increasing their foreign bond investments, supported by the dollar's rapid appreciation against the yen, underwriters said.</p>
<p>Investors will be closely monitoring the currency market, with intervention fears growing as the dollar rallies. They are also watching domestic interest rates to see whether the possibility of credit-tightening surfaces in Japan, they said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not expecting retail investors to cut their U.S. Treasury or dual-currency bond buying very aggressively, because they are not expecting the dollar to crash,&quot; another senior underwriter said.</p>
<p>&quot;Demand should be constant, but total volume may fall because the dollar is unlikely to rise dramatically from current levels,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Retail investors have increased their foreign bond investments since the start of the fiscal year on April 1, which was seen as supportive of the dollar in a month when major institutional investors were mostly sidelined.</p>
<p>On a payment date basis, total samurai bond issues in April reached 380 billion yen, the highest level since December, underwriters said.</p>
<p>In addition to buying samurai bonds, private Japanese investors have been shifting funds from bank deposits and postal savings into foreign bonds denominated in various currencies, such as the U.S. dollar, the Australian dollar and the pound.</p>
<p>George Magnus, chief international economist at UBS Ltd, said sentiment in the currency market has changed from two years ago, with dollar-selling intervention pressure growing.</p>
<p>&quot;If we do have some intervention over the next weeks or months, it's going to be the reverse of what we've seen during the last couple of years,&quot; Magnus said.</p>
<p>Magnus said that for the immediate future, private investors may find it difficult to keep investing in U.S. Treasuries and other foreign bonds at the same pace as they have been.</p>
<p>&quot;In a general context, I think the pace of accumulation, which we've seen over the last year or two, is probably going to slow down a bit,&quot; Magnus said.</p>
