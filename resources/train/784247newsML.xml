<p>The battle for control of rugby league in Australia moved closer to resolution on Thursday when Rupert Murdoch's rebel Super League clubs supported an Australian Rugby League (ARL) peace plan.</p>
<p>The 10 Super League clubs approved a proposal by the ARL, the sport's national governing body, for a unified competition in 1998, a Super League spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;Our clubs were briefed on the proposal during a telephone hook-up this morning and have agreed in principle to support it,&quot; Rebecca Wilson said.</p>
<p>&quot;At this stage there is nothing more we can say about it, it's now up to the ARL clubs to consider it,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Both the ARL and Super League have agreed to refer the peace plan to their respective clubs after making amendments to an original ARL peace proposal at a meeting in Sydney on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Details about the meeting were not made public.</p>
<p>But Murdoch's Daily Telegraph newspaper in Sydney said on Thursday it understood the ARL had agreed to let Super League control the game's finances in return for the day-to-day running of the game.</p>
<p>ARL spokesman John Brady said the 12 ARL-loyal clubs would discuss the proposal later this week.</p>
<p>Brady told Reuters the plan did not address the emotive issue of how many clubs would be needed in a unified competition or the question of television rights.</p>
<p>Super League wants to establish an elite 12-team competition but the ARL wants a minimum of 16 clubs and the consensus among media commentators is that they will reach a 14-team compromise.</p>
<p>Murdoch launched the rebel league earlier this year primarily to provide sports programming for his local cable operation Foxtel.</p>
<p>He is believed to have committed about A$400 million (US$292 million) to set up and run the rebel league in Australia and the established leagues in New Zealand, Britain and France with which Super League is aligned.</p>
<p>The ARL is backed by Foxtel's local cable competitor Optus, which is thought to have spent about A$120 million funding the 12 ARL clubs in the main competition and the ARL itself.</p>
