<headline>Malaysia to review foreign labour policy.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-09-22</dateline>

<p>Malaysia will review its overseas labour recruitment policy after receiving complaints that foreign workers were involved in violence and causing social distrubances, local newspapers reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim was quoted as saying on Saturday that the government had received numerous complaints about foreign workers from the public.</p>
<p>&quot;We will look into it (policy) now,&quot; Anwar, who is also chairman of the Cabinet Committee on Foreign Workers, was quoted as saying The Sun.</p>
<p>&quot;We have received several complaints and objections on their employment. That is why we are studying the matter so that we can come up with solutions,&quot; he was quoted as saying by the Star.</p>
<p>Foreign workers, especially Bangladeshis, have recently been involved in various fights with the local population.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, a local man was assaulted by 13 Bangladeshis when he warned them against disturbing his sister.</p>
<p>Two days earlier, a factory security guard was beaten up by a group of Bangladeshi workers when he tried to stop one of them from bringing a friend into the factory hostel.</p>
<p>The worst incident took place on September 10 when seven Bangladeshi workers were seriously injured in a fight involving 70 Bangladeshis and residents of a village in southern Johor state. The cause of the fight was not known.</p>
<p>Booming Malaysia has more than 1.2 million foreign workers out of a total workforce of around eight million.</p>
