<p>NWE high sulphur fuel oil prices softened on Friday with traders gloomily forecasting further falls next week in a bearish market despite a late rally on Brent crude futures.</p>
<p>Utility buyers heard offers of $82 a tonne cif NWE for high sulphur cargoes, down $2 on the day, but no trades were reported and bids were thought to be slipping below Thursday's $80 mark.</p>
<p>&quot;The price is still on the slide,&quot; said one buyer, &quot;I wouldn't be surprised if we see numbers beginning with seven soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Warm weather leading to over-supply, fluctuating crude prices and the expected influx of Iraqi material were all said to be weighing down the fuel oil sector, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a very dismal picture ahead for next week,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges slipped $2 to $83.50, with trades heard at $86, $82 and then $84 a tonne.</p>
<p>High sulphur cargo prices in the Med also fell, with cargoes chasing homes and Thursday's sale to a Spanish refinery of bunker material setting the marker below its price of $85.50.</p>
<p>Low sulphur fuel oil prices in the north and the Med were supported by poor prompt supply but low U.S. prices for late month availability will cap rises, traders said.</p>
<p>One European refiner was heard to be offering low sulphur fuel oil at $102 fob, above price norms, but no buyers were seen in a thin market.</p>
