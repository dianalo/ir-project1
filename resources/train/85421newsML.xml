<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Monday he would travel to Washington for Tuesday's Middle East peace summit with an open mind and a commitment for results.</p>
<p>Speaking after a meeting with European Union foreign ministers, Arafat said: &quot;We are committed to a concrete result. we hope something will be achieved.&quot;</p>
<p>Arafat said he was confident the Washington summit, called by U.S. President Bill Clinton, could be a success despite the absence of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. He said the Egyptian foreign minister would take part in his place.</p>
<p>Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, speaking for the European Union, said the EU would continue to provide financial and other help to the Palestinian government.</p>
<p>&quot;We need a strong signal from the Israeli government that they are also committed to peace,&quot; Spring said.</p>
<p>Arafat was due to leave late on Monday night for Washington.</p>
<p>Asked earlier at Luxembourg airport on arrival what he wanted from Netanyahu, Arafat told reporters:</p>
<p>&quot;I am not asking for the moon, I am only asking for what had been agreed upon and what had been signed to be implemented accurately and honestly.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The agreement which I had signed (was) not with the Labour Party, I signed it with the government of Israel. This had been accepted in the Knesset (the Israeli parliament), also it had been accepted in our legislative council and in our national council.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So we are committed to it, the Israelis are committed to it, and we have to do our best to protect the peace process.&quot;</p>
