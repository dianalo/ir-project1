<p>International Business Machines Corp. Tuesday reported fourth-quarter earnings that were slightly better than expected, bolstered by its service business, growth in software sales and tight expense controls.</p>
<p>The world's largest computer maker said net income rose about 18 percent to $2.02 billion in the quarter from $1.71 billion in the 1995 quarter.</p>
<p>Earnings per share rose faster, to $3.93 from $3.09, since IBM had 7 percent fewer shares outstanding in the quarter due to stock buybacks. Wall Street analysts had expected profits of $3.88 a share on average, according to First Call, which tracks earnings estimates.</p>
<p>Analysts and investors said the results looked good, but some said IBM stock might come under profit-taking pressure on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;It's an excellent number, it's an excellent quarter. You really can't say anything bad about it. But I think it may cause a brief period of selling because Wall Street (sells) on that kind of news,&quot; said Thom Brown, managing director of Rutherford Brown and Catherwood.</p>
<p>&quot;They were mixed results, software and services were great&quot; and European results were somewhat encouraging, said David Takata, a Gruntal &amp; Co. analyst.</p>
<p>But he said weak mainframe computer revenues were disappointing. Some analysts had been predicting mainframe revenues rose in the quarter due to strong new products.</p>
<p>The Armonk, N.Y.-based computer maker said service revenues jumped 22 percent in the quarter and personal computer sales rose, but sales of mainframes fell and RS/6000 minicomputers were flat.</p>
<p>Software revenues rose 4 percent in the quarter, and hardware sales increased 2 percent.</p>
<p>Revenues overall rose 5.6 percent to $23.14 billion from $21.92 billion. Expenses fell 2 percent in the quarter from the 1995 period, IBM said.</p>
<p>&quot;We showed good growth in the fourth quarter despite a difficult year-over-year comparison, continued weakness in Europe and a greater-than-expected currency impact,&quot; IBM Chairman Louis Gerstner said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;Although we still face many challenges, IBM is a much different company than it was only a few years ago,&quot; he said, noting IBM's services business accounted for 21 percent of revenues at the end of 1996 compared to 13 percent in 1993.</p>
<p>The impact of converting revenues received in foreign currencies into dollars erased three percentage points from the fourth-quarter revenue gain, IBM said. That compared with about a two point positive impact in the 1995 quarter.</p>
<p>Net earnings for the year rose to $5.4 billion, or $10.24 a share, from $4.2 billion, or $7.23 a share, in 1995. The 1996 results included a charge for research and development from the acquisition of Lotus Development Corp.</p>
<p>Full-year revenues rose 5.6 percent to $75.95 billion from $71.94 billion.</p>
<p>In a break with tradition, IBM released its results after the stock market closed rather than before the market opened.</p>
<p>Analysts said there was no particular significance to IBM reporting after the close. IBM was trying to avoid the drastic swings in its stock that have come during a conference call with analysts it hosts after the earnings are released.</p>
<p>The stock closed up $1 at $168 in consolidated trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>By region, revenues in North America rose 11 percent to $9.6 billion in the fourth quarter, Asia-Pacific rose 6 percent to $4.3 billion and Latin America gained 4.0 percent to $1.1 billion. Revenues in Europe, Middle East and Africa were $8.1 billion, little changed year over year.</p>
