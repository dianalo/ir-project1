<p>The Reserve Bank has again been accused of being too pessimistic about the economy and urged to consider an interest rate cut by the end of September, when conditions should be right.</p>
<p>Board of Executors economist Rob Lee said in his latest Investment Outlook on Tuesday that the central bank was sticking to a too strict interpretation of its constitutional duties to keep inflation down.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe that the bank is too pessimistic about how much the inflation rate is already set to fall,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>&quot;In particular, they may be underestimating the downward impact on inflation of increasingly rapid integration into the global economy. The larger than expected overseas investment allowances are the latest example of this.&quot;</p>
<p>Lee forecast that inflation would fall rapidly over the next two years to about five percent. This implied that there was scope for much lower interest rates, though possibly only one in 1997.</p>
<p>Some move on interest rates was important given the slowing economy, which could already be defined as being in recession and remain so for some time.</p>
<p>Although government had speeded up its economic reforms to stimulate growth, Lee said the Reserve Bank's monetary policy could now be considered too stringent to meet growth targets.</p>
<p>Last month Lee accused the Reserve Bank of &quot;economic overkill&quot; in its approach to interest rates.</p>
<p>The central bank's forecasts on inflation appeared to be more cautious than most and it wanted to see more evidence of lower wage growth.</p>
<p>It also appeared far less willing to move rates down ahead of expected lower inflation than it was to move rates up to pre-empt rising inflation.</p>
<p>The bank was unimpressed with the view that recent high broad money and credit growth was distorted by structural changes and achieving the target growth remained a priority.</p>
<p>&quot;Although continued economic weakness should soon be reflected in money and credit data, this pre-condition appears to rule out a rate cut until September at the earliest,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>A key issue would be how much the rand weakened with the partial lifting of exchange controls.</p>
<p>Lee said that some exchange rate weakness was appropriate but that the Reserve Bank had ample reserves to prevent a major slide in the rand, especially as net outflows were not likely to be large.</p>
<p>&quot;South Africa is likely to receive an investment grade rating from the key credit rating agency in September,&quot; Lee said.</p>
<p>&quot;This will reinforce continued foreign interest in the country.&quot;</p>
