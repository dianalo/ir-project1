<p>Australian dollar support survived another session of offshore pressure Wednesday in a struggle to establish exactly where its floor lay after Friday's rate cut.</p>
<p>On the bid side today were local corporates, and some of the local banks along with options-related demand which had held the line at US$0.7635 since Friday's slide from US$0.7770.</p>
<p>On the offer were a who's who of U.S. investment banks who had been aggressive sellers since the dollar's yield advantage disappeared. Traders suspected they were out both to trigger a stop-loss rout and, more worrying for bulls in the longer run, to lighten their portfolio exposure to the currency.  </p>
<p>By 5.00 pm (0700 GMT) the local dollar was keeping its chin up at US$0.7658/63 having dipped as low as US$0.7634 during the day after finishing Tuesday at US$0.7650/55 here.</p>
<p>Further chart support was put at US$0.7620 and 76 cents while bears had their sights on the 1997 low of US$0.7550 hit in February. A break would see it to 15-month lows and risk a return to the 73 cent trough from January last year.</p>
<p>On the topside, resistance at US$0.7675 had established itself as tough over the last couple of days, but analysts felt the market was short enough overall to allow a squeeze to the US$0.7710/20 area short term.  </p>
<p>But the dollar would have to recover the US$0.7770 level held before the Reserve Bank's easing, to counter the present bearish trend.</p>
<p>Traders felt this a tall order given Australian money market rates out to two-years had already fallen below those in the U.S. and looked likely to move further in the US$'s favour given the pace of U.S. economic growth.</p>
<p>The latest strength came Tuesday when consumer sentiment data for May showed a rousing 8.6 point jump to a 28-year high of 127.1. If the Fed did hike it would take official U.S. rates above Australian levels for the first in more than a decade.  </p>
<p>On the crosses the local currency was loitering at 88.90/00 yen from 88.70/80 late here Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was an undercurrent of concern about impending maturities of dual currency samurai bonds, made worse by mistaken press reports of the amount involved.</p>
<p>One Japanese newspaper said bonds worth as much as 90 billion Australian dollars were coming due -- a wild figure which would have come close to half of the country's entire national debt. This was later corrected to 90 billion yen, or a much more manageable A$810 million, but the brief scare served as a taste of things to come later this year.  </p>
<p>From October onwards a flood of yen/A$ samurais do mature and if Japanese investors chose not to roll these over or re-invest the money into other A$ assets, the currency could come under pressure against the yen, said dealers.</p>
<p>In trade weighted terms the dollar was steady at 58.3.</p>
<p>On the domestic front, economic data Thursday might offer a little direction although the RBA had rendered them largely irrelevant by cutting rates when it did.</p>
<p>Business inventories for the March quarter will add another piece to the GDP jigsaw. Forecasts are for a 0.5 percent rise following a larger than expected 1.2 percent gain in Q4.  </p>
<p>Since it is the size of the change that matters with stocks, such a gain would imply a small detraction from growth in the quarter.</p>
<p>Also out Thursday is the balance of goods and services for April, which has partly replaced the old monthly current account series. Analysts are looking for a surplus of around A$100 million after a A$103 million deficit in March.</p>
<p>More important will be quarterly balance of payments data Friday which will provide the first current account details for the March quarter and a contribution of exports to GDP.</p>
