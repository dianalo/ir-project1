<p>Russia's interior minister ordered security to be tightened across the country on Wednesday after accusing security chief Alexander Lebed of plotting to seize power while President Boris Yeltsin awaits heart surgery.</p>
<p>General Anatoly Kulikov said tougher precautions were needed because of intelligence reports about planned attacks by rebels from breakaway Chechnya, but gave no details of the measures.</p>
<p>He had said earlier on Wednesday that Lebed, Yeltsin's national security adviser and Kulikov's opponent in a fierce Kremlin power struggle, was planning a &quot;creeping coup&quot; with the aid of Chechen rebels.</p>
<p>Lebed denied the accusations and said he would press charges against Kulikov. Yeltsin, who doctors said would have his heart operation in mid-November, expressed his concern at Kulikov's allegations and demanded details.</p>
<p>&quot;(Lebed) has decided to move ahead using force instead of waiting for the next presidential poll,&quot; Kulikov told a news conference. &quot;The question is what awaits Russia if Lebed comes to power through a creeping coup.&quot;</p>
<p>Kulikov later told a television interviewer that he had agreed on the need for tougher security with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Nikolai Kovalyev, head of the FSB Federal Security Service.</p>
<p>&quot;Today Nikolai Kovalyev and I, with the agreement of the head of the government, signed a telegram to local branches (of the interior ministry) and Federal Security Service departments ordering a switch to a stronger security regime,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Moscow police could not immediately confirm that any special measures had been taken.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin summoned Kulikov, Kovalyev, Defence Minister Igor Rodionov and other security officials to a meeting on Thursday which Itar-Tass news agency said would discuss the row between Lebed and Kulikov.</p>
<p>A Yeltsin spokesman told Interfax news agency that the president had demanded a report on Kulikov's accusations from Chernomyrdin and the interior minister himself.</p>
<p>Hardline communists staged a coup d'etat against then Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991, but failed. Frequent rumours of coups since then have proved false.</p>
<p>Lebed denied any wrong-doing. He told Interfax: &quot;I intend to sue Anatoly Kulikov.&quot;</p>
<p>The row marked a further heightening of a power struggle which has intensified since Yeltsin announced on September 5 that he would need a heart operation. Yeltsin appealed for an end to the &quot;verbal duels&quot; on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sergei Mironov, head of the Kremlin medical centre, made clear on Wednesday that Yeltsin had had a blood problem but it had now cleared up and his operation would not be delayed.</p>
<p>Yeltsin met President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus at the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow. He moved slowly and his eyes were puffy in brief television footage.</p>
<p>Yeltsin dropped out of public view shortly before he was reelected on July 3. He had two heart attacks last year and one surgeon says he may have had a third this summer.</p>
<p>He has handed some of his duties to Chernomyrdin, but many officials have been jostling for position.</p>
<p>Lebed, 46, has not hidden his presidential ambitions since Yeltsin made him his national security adviser and secretary of his influential Security Council last June after he came third in the presidential election. He has many rivals in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>Lebed says Kulikov knowingly let fighting rage on in Chechnya until a peace deal was signed on August 31. Kulikov hit back by saying the peace deal, which Lebed signed, amounted to capitulation by Moscow.</p>
<p>He said on Wednesday that Lebed planned to set up an elite &quot;legion&quot; to stage a mutiny and that he had been promised 1,500 Chechen gunmen to help.</p>
<p>Interfax quoted the rebels as denying the allegation, while a top Lebed aide said all plans for a new mobile force had been discussed with Kulikov and others.</p>
<p>The drama overshadowed a visit to Moscow by U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry, intended to persuade parliament to ratify the START-2 treaty which would slash the number of strategic nuclear warheads to a third of Cold War levels.</p>
<p>Rodionov said after talks with Perry that he hoped parliament would ratify the treaty.</p>
