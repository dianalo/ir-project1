<p>A former French defence minister, the late Charles Hernu, was paid as an agent of the Soviet Union and other east bloc countries in the 1950s and 1960s, a French magazine said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>&quot;Charles Hernu was an agent of the East,&quot; the weekly L'Express said. Hernu, defence minister from 1981 to 1985 under Socialist president Francois Mitterrand, died in 1990.</p>
<p>The magazine said Hernu was spotted as a rising political star by a Bulgarian spy in Paris in 1953, and was paid by Bulgaria, Romania and the Soviet Union until at least 1963 for writing reports about French politics.</p>
<p>L'Express said Mitterrand was informed in 1992 of the payments to Hernu by French counter-intelligence chief Jacques Fournet and ordered the scandal covered up as a state secret. Mitterrand, a personal friend of Hernu, left power in May 1995 and died last January.</p>
<p>The magazine said it was unknown whether Hernu had acted for the east bloc when he became defence minister.</p>
<p>&quot;Still today, the question is open: did the Russians play this secret weapon against Charles Hernu after 1981? The answer is still buried in the most secret archives of the KGB,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The magazine said a record of the payments to Hernu, known by the codenames of &quot;Andre&quot; or &quot;Dinu&quot;, was handed to France by an east bloc country after the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p>Among the biggest payments to Hernu, L'Express said, he had accepted the equivalent of 300,000 francs ($60,000) in 1958 to fund an election campaign to the French parliament. Despite the cash, Hernu lost.</p>
<p>Hernu resigned in disgrace in 1985 after French agents sank the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior in Auckland harbour as the vessel was preparing to protest against French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.</p>
<p>Hernu's son Patrice said he would ask President Jacques Chirac for an investigation into the charges, saying he found it impossible to believe that his father had been a Moscow puppet when in office.</p>
<p>He noted that Hernu had been criticised more for his warmth towards the United States than to Moscow.</p>
<p>Yves Bonnet, head of the DST French counter-intelligence services in 1982-85, also said he was shocked by the charges.</p>
<p>&quot;I can say that nothing in his behaviour, dealing with a number of delicate issues that affected our security in relation to the Soviet Union, justifies such an allegation,&quot; he told LCI television.</p>
