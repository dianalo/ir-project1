<title>SOUTH AFRICA: South Africa said to seek arms deal with Beijing.</title>

<p>South Africa is negotiating to sell advanced military technology to China in a deal worth about one billion rand, or $220 million, the Sunday newspaper Rapport said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Afrikaans-language weekly said Brian Blackbeard of the arms manufacturer Reutech -- part of the state-run Armscor conglomerate -- had confirmed that a contract was being sought with Beijing.</p>
<p>No independent confirmation was immediately available. However, the report fits recent assertions by President Nelson Mandela's government that South Africa has a world-class arms industry and intends to export wherever it chooses.</p>
<p>Rapport said China was interested in a variety of high-tech arms and equipment, including two dimensional radar, with the possibility of a later upgrade to three-dimensional scanning.</p>
<p>The paper quoted Blackbeard as saying the South African system was extremely sophisticated and ranked as &quot;the best in the world&quot;.</p>
<p>China was specifically interested in the radar system because it fitted its military requirements, it quoted Blackbeard as saying.</p>
<p>The arms deal would also include a tank firing and guidance system like the one South Africa may yet sell to Syria, if it is prepared to defy strong United States objections.</p>
<p>Rapport said however that while Syria could be offered a straight sale of equipment to upgrade its tanks, South Africa could make a deal allowing China to manufacture and develop the system.</p>
<p>A leak of cabinet documents last month disclosed that South Africa was preparing to tender for a major contract to upgrade Syrian's ageing, Soviet-built T-72 tanks.</p>
<p>The United States, which regards Syria as a terrorist state, warned it would cut off aid to South Africa if such a deal went ahead, prompting an angry Mandela to tell Washington his government would do business with whomever it chose, whether or not they were friends of the West.</p>
<p>South Africa has made no final decision on whether to pursue the Syrian contract.</p>
