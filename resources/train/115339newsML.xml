<p>Emerging debt prices barely flickered on Monday with the market closed from noon for the U.S. Columbus Day holiday.</p>
<p>The market had ended last week higher in line with U.S. Treasuries after slipping earlier.</p>
<p>&quot;There's nothing going on at all. Everyone is looking to close at midday,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>About the only activity was in Russian MinFins with the earlier maturities slightly firmer.</p>
<p>Several analysts are now recommending Russian debt, which soared this month on the back of a credit rating, despite uncertainty over the country's political outlook.</p>
<p>&quot;There is further scope for spreads on Russian paper to tighten in against the rest of the market,&quot; ING Barings said in a research note.</p>
<p>The next key rallying point is the planned Russian Eurobond, generally expected to be priced with a spread of 350 basis points.</p>
<p>Also the chances of the Vneshekonombank debt restructuring deal with commercial banks not going through have virutually been elminiated.</p>
<p>ING picked MinFin bonds three and four -- which mature in 1999 and 2003 respectively -- as looking particularly attractive.</p>
<p>&quot;The Russian yield curve remains fairly flat, which makes short-maturity bonds look especially cheap,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>It added that spreads between when-and-if Vneshekonombank principal loans and the interest arrears notes could narrow up to 75 points as the market rallies.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley analyst Eric Fine said he expected Russia's foreign currency debt yield curve to shift downwards by as much as 240 points by the end of the first quarter next year.</p>
<p>&quot;We believe Vnesh Principal (when-and-if)...offer potential annualised total returns of up to 47 percent between now and the end of the first quarter of 1997,&quot; Fine said.</p>
