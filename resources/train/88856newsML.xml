<headline>Japan and U.S. agree on new insurance deadline.</headline>

<p>The United States and Japan agreed on Tuesday to set a new deadline of December 15 to settle their long-running dispute over insurance, putting off any immediate threat of U.S. trade retaliation.</p>
<p>The announcement was made by Japanese Finance Minister Wataru Kubo, in Washington for a meeting of the Group of Seven industrialised nations.</p>
<p>Kubo told reporters that he and U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky held negotiations on September 29 and 30 and agreed to commit themselves to continue talks for a final agreement by December 15.</p>
<p>&quot;Since we have reached an agreement like this, there is no possibility of the United States applying the Super 301 (trade clause) over the insurance issue,&quot; Kubo said.</p>
<p>Super 301 allows Washington to impose punitive tariffs on nations seen to be violating international trade rules.</p>
<p>At issue is Japan's $382 billion domestic insurance market, although the problem unusually focuses on a deregulation move by Tokyo to allow big Japanese firms to enter a niche sector now dominated by foreign insurance firms.</p>
<p>Known as the &quot;third sector&quot;, it includes such cover as personal accident, sickness and nursing care.</p>
<p>Kubo said if agreement could not be reached by the December deadline, Japan could delay domestic firms' entry into the third sector until after January 1, 1997.</p>
<p>Separately, a MOF official told reporters both Washington and Tokyo would have to agree on the restrictions to be placed on Japanese insurance firms' business in the third sector.</p>
<p>As part of efforts to settle the dispute, the Japanese government also lifted a ban on the sale of auto insurance by mail on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The change will help foreign companies, which do not have a large network of agents to do business.</p>
<p>But Japan and the United States remain far apart on solving the overall dispute, and an agreement may be elusive ahead of elections in both the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>The U.S. presidential election is November 5, while general elections for Japan's Lower House of parliament are to be held on October 20.</p>
<p>Washington is demanding that the third sector not be opened to Japanese firms until Tokyo's primary and casualty markets are fully opened to foreign competition.</p>
