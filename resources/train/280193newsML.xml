<p>The leader of rebels fighting to topple Zaire's government on Monday said the army had launched a counter-attack on rebel positions south of the eastern town of Uvira but were repulsed by the rebel force.</p>
<p>Laurent Kabila, head of the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire (ADFL), told reporters that Zaire's army attacked Fizi and nearby villages last night and fighting went on until Monday morning.</p>
<p>Kabila said his forces had managed to repel the attack but there was no independent confirmation.</p>
<p>&quot;The Zaire army attacked Fizi and the villages around at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) last night and fought until this morning when the forces of the alliance repulsed them,&quot; said Kabila.</p>
<p>The rebel chief said a smaller attack had also taken place at Itombwe, 40 km (25 miles) from Uvira, and that the army had again been pushed back.</p>
<p>The alliance that began the rebellion three months ago with a group of mostly ethnic Tutsis, now occupies a 500 km (300 mile) swathe of eastern Zaire along the border with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.</p>
<p>Mobutu Sese Seko, Zaire's president for over 31 years, last week named a new government whose primary responsibility is to crush the rebels.</p>
<p>The sprawling central African country with vast mineral resources is facing its worst crisis in decades and so far Zaire's ragged and poorly-paid army has been unable to turn back he rebel advance.</p>
<p>The latest push by the Zaireans came after rebels announced last week that they had captured the eastern town of Bunia but Kinshasa said it still had control of the airport and heavy fighting was raging.</p>
<p>Bunia is on the threshold of vast gold and mineral resources in the Upper Zaire province, and was one of the few remaining airstrips in the east used by the army to bring reinforcements.</p>
<p>It is also at the head of one of the few passable roads in the region west to Kisangani, the biggest city in the east, in the heart of the jungle and which the rebels have threatened to target.</p>
<p>Uvira, once a strategic base for Burundian Hutu rebels waging war against Bujumbura's Tutsi army junta, was the second town to be captured by the rebels after they took nearby Kamanyola on the Rwandan border three months ago.</p>
<p>Africa's latest conflict was sparked off by Zairean attempts to expel back to Rwanda the Banyamulenge -- an ethnic Tutsi group that migrated to Zaire up to 200 years ago.</p>
<p>The Banyamulenge, backed by Rwanda's battle-hardened Tutsi-dominated army, resisted and took up arms to fight for their rights as Zaireans.</p>
<p>The rebellion soon spread after Kabila's anti-Mobutu forces forged a link with the Banyamulenge and marched through eastern Zaire capturing Kamanyola, Uvira, Bukavu, Goma, Beni and Butembo.</p>
