<p>South Africa may reopen an inquest into the 1977 death of black activist leader Steve Biko if new evidence comes to light from five police officers who confessed to beating him to death, a newspaper said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Sunday Independent quoted Justice Minister Dullah Omar as saying the application for amnesty from the five former officers to South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission did not mean the case would remain closed.</p>
<p>The commission is seeking to heal the scars of South Africa's apartheid past by exposing the truth about crimes committed in the name of the system -- as well as by its violent opponents. It has the power to offer amnesty to those who confess.</p>
<p>&quot;No application for amnesty is automatically granted,&quot; the paper quoted Omar as saying. &quot;The perpetrators will have to show a political motive and the committee has to be satisfied that there is full disclosure.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;But if the independent investigations reveal any new evidence and information, then I will ask the relevant attorney general to reopen the inquests,&quot; Omar told the Independent.</p>
<p>The minister said he had met the Biko family to discuss its opposition to the granting of amnesty to the killers of the anti-apartheid campaigner, who was arrested in Port Elizabeth and severely beaten under interrogation in 1977.</p>
<p>He died shortly afterwards, with his wounds untreated, in a Pretoria jail. An inquest two months afterwards -- now revealed to be a whitewash -- absolved the police of blame.</p>
<p>The Independent quoted Francois van der Merwe, lawyer for the five ex-policemen, as saying his clients would not make any major revelations about Biko's death but would simply clarify some issues.</p>
<p>The five have applied to the Truth Commission for amnesty for the culpable homicide of Biko and have indicated they will claim his death was not intentional.</p>
