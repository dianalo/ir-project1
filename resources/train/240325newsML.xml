<p>India's Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda called on Friday for stable world oil prices at a global conference between consumer and producer countries being held against a backdrop of a market nearing six-year highs.</p>
<p>&quot;Producers and consumers have an equal interest in the stability of energy prices,&quot; Gowda told an audience that included ministers from 15 of 37 participating countries.</p>
<p>&quot;Yet in the global market place oil prices have shown anything but a clear and predictable trend,&quot; he said at a welcoming ceremony that opened with a Hindu prayer to fire and energy.</p>
<p>The &quot;Fifth International Energy Conference&quot; hosted by India in its tourist playground of Goa formally starts on Saturday.</p>
<p>North Sea Brent crude approached its mid-October, post-Gulf War high of US$25.06 a barrel this week, about $8 higher than the last consumer-producer meeting in Venezuela in 1995.</p>
<p>The call for price stability has become a mantra during the four previous consumer-producer meetings, initiated in the wake of the 1990-1991 Gulf War oil price scare.</p>
<p>&quot;We need stability, and to remain stable we need to create a suitable climate for investment,&quot; Venezeulan Energy Minister Erwin Arrietta said in an opening address.</p>
<p>But the forum exerts little influence over the market and discussions centre on other macro-energy issues including investment requirements, technology, alternative energy sources and the environment.</p>
<p>Norway's Energy Minister Grete Faremo floated an idea that the gatherings could evolve into a global energy policy setting forum along the lines of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>&quot;We can use this producer-consumer dialogue to put energy on the political agenda,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The world's major industrialised energy importers for the most part have shrugged off this year's sharp rise in crude oil prices, which are nearing their highest levels since the Gulf War.</p>
<p>Inflationary pressures so far have not been triggered. But if prices don't deflate, that could change.</p>
<p>For emerging countries with large energy deficits, like India, the price issue is already becoming increasingly painful as import bills swell.</p>
<p>But while consumers are looking for stability at cheaper levels, producers want high, stable prices after seeing real oil values, stripping out inflation, slump in the decade from 1986.</p>
<p>OPEC producers, represented in Goa by six ministers and officials from four of its other five members, are increasingly confident that Brent prices can be sustained around $20-$25.</p>
<p>&quot;These prices are here to stay,&quot; a senior official from a Middle East OPEC country said after arriving on Thursday.</p>
<p>High prices certainly don't appear to have hit demand yet, with world oil consumption set to grow next year by another 1.9 million barrels a day (bpd) to 73.7 million bpd, according to International Energy Agency (IEA) projections.</p>
<p>Demand this year has outstripped even the most ambitious oil producers' projections and the market is now heading into the peak demand northern winter.</p>
<p>But the partial resumption of Iraqi exports, which Baghdad says could begin next week under a U.N. oil-for-food deal, provided some relief for oil consumers on Friday, slicing 50 cents off crude prices.</p>
