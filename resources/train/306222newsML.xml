<p>Finnish shares on Tuesday shrugged off some talk of a correction to hit new records as bulls took courage from U.S. CPI data, tossing shares to strong gains, particularly in the financial sector, brokers said.</p>
<p>The general HEX index rose more than one percent to break through the 2,700-point barrier in late trade, but closed just off it. It ended up 1.12 percent at 2,698.6.</p>
<p>The extended January buying-spree boosted trade to over a billion markka but technical redemption of Lansivoima shares inflated volume by some 250 million markka.</p>
<p>&quot;This (market) is very bullish,&quot; one broker said, referring to sentiment after the in-line U.S. inflation data.</p>
<p>&quot;These were good figures. They were even surprisingly well received by the market, U.S. CPI doesn't usually affect our market so much,&quot; said another.</p>
<p>Merita broke the 16 markka psychological barrier and closed up 1.00 markka or 6.54 percent at 16.30, still supported by Friday's report that Merita pension funds would be allowed to repay over one billion markka of contributions to the group.</p>
<p>Nokia also breached resistance, heartened by Ericsson in Stockholm and ended above the 300.00 barrier, up 4.50 markka at 302.00 after very active trade.</p>
<p>Raisio remained strong on recent press reports and added another seven percent to close at a new 362.00 markka record.</p>
<p>There was also buying interest in forestry shares amid recent analyst upgrades for the industry.</p>
<p>&quot;It's back to basics. Investors are buying bluechips. They are looking for cyclical shares, especially because of the strong dollar,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>But &quot;there's always a bad hangover at some point,&quot; said another broker.</p>
