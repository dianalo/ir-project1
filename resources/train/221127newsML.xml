<title>FRANCE: French government sacks GAN head.</title>

<p>The French government fired the head of state-owned insurance group GAN on Wednesday and said that it would name a replacement later in the day.</p>
<p>Asked by reporters after a cabinet meeting if a decree to remove Bonnaud had been accepted, Lamassoure said &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
<p>He would not comment further on the removal of Bonnaud but told a news conference Finance Minister Jean Arthuis would name a successor later in the day.</p>
<p>The decree was adopted after GAN boss Jean-Jacques Bonnaud refused a government call to step down following the failure of attempts to privatise GAN's regional banking network Credit Industriel et Commercial (CIC).</p>
<p>Business daily Les Echos said earlier that the government was expected to name Didier Pfeiffer, vice-chairman of UAP which is merging with rival insurer Axa.</p>
<p>The government demanded Bonnaud's resignation last week. Whoever replaces him is expected to name a replacement for Barnard Yoncourt as chairman of the CIC subsidiary.</p>
<p>The call came after Arthuis earlier this month said he was calling off a tender for the sale ot 67 percent of CIC.</p>
<p>Arthuis says he is still determined to privatise the bank.</p>
<p>Arthuis said Bonnaud, as well as CIC chairman Yoncourt, had not helped to promote the sell-off. Yoncourt had warned that the sale of CIC, a group of 11 regional banks, to a major French bank could spell its &quot;death.&quot;</p>
<p>The plan to privatise CIC ran into fierce opposition from opposition politicians and staff and the government received only two offers for the banking network, both of which were reported to have offered a low price.</p>
<p>Banking analysts blamed the lacklustre response to the govenrment's initial call for bids on strict government conditions placed on the sale.</p>
