<p>One of South Africa's leading industrial employers said on Tuesday it was planning to take part of its business to India, lured by low labour costs and a healthier market for its products.</p>
<p>Engineering and transport group Dorbyl said on Tuesday it would close down its bus manufacturing plant in the Eastern Cape province -- one of the two in the country -- by the end of July.</p>
<p>Rob Duff, Dorbyl's transport division manager, said India topped the list of several countries the firm was considering as a site for relocation.</p>
<p>He said their bus division had been hurt by fierce competition since 1985 and the situation was worsened by the emergence of the minibus taxi industry, now a pivotal mode of transport for millions of blacks.</p>
<p>&quot;(Our bus plant) hasn't made money for 12 years and we have also suffered a massive decline in volumes. We will be closing it at the end of July,&quot; Duff told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;The whole South African market used to make about 3,000 buses a year and now it's less than a thousand,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The plant's closure means about 160 employees will have their jobs axed at the end of July, Duff said.</p>
<p>&quot;All I am prepared to say is that all our input costs are uncompetitive. The bus industry is probably in the worst condition than it has ever been in 30 years.&quot;</p>
<p>Dorbyl's announcement comes amid a tense standoff between the country's labour force and employers who on Monday faced a 24-hour strike by South Africa's labour union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu), over planned new labour laws.</p>
<p>Cosatu which represents 1.9 million members, is demanding a 40 hour working week phased in within five years, six months maternity leave and the minimum age for formal employment to be set at 18.</p>
<p>But employers say the demands are a recipe to make South Africa uncompetitive on the world's economic stage and threatened to unwind the fledgling economy President Nelson Mandela's government was trying to rebuild following four decades of apartheid misrule.</p>
<p>&quot;In India they are prepared to work 48 hours a week for salaries that are less than 50 percent of the costs and here the load is just taking everybody out...and it's doing extreme damage to the economy,&quot; Duff said.</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, the labour cost there (India) are much lower than in South Africa -- more than 50 percent lower -- and that is why we are considering moving our plant there,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Dorbyl, which employs about 11,000 people in its nationwide operations serving water, ship repair, mining, construction and automotive component industries, reported a slump in its 1996 year-end earnings last week.</p>
<p>The group reported headline earnings per share of 387.2 cents versus 421.9 cents.</p>
<p>&quot;We've tried for 12 years to keep the (plant) alive...and the market has just slid away and now imports are coming in which are more competively priced,&quot; Duff said.</p>
<p>He said Dorbyl would still continue operating its other bus plant in the Northern Province, but cautioned that its future too might have to be reviewed if market conditions failed to improve.</p>
