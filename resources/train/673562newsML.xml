<p>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. has agreed to pay $30 million to settle a 2-1/2-year investigation by the Orange County district attorney's office into the county's 1994 bankruptcy, sources said Thursday.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the out-of-court settlement, the district attorney will close the investigation of Merrill Lynch and its employees, and agree not to bring any action against them.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch will deny any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, sources close to the probe said.</p>
<p>Orange County shocked Wall Street in December 1994 when it filed for bankruptcy after losing more than $1.6 billion on risky investments made by its once-respected treasurer, Robert Citron. The county emerged from bankruptcy one year ago.</p>
<p>The district attorney planned to hold a news conference at 10 a.m. (1 p.m. EDT) to make the announcement. County prosecutors declined to comment in advance.</p>
<p>An Orange County grand jury has been investigating various bond and investment firms, including Merrill Lynch, and other financial professionals in connection with the county's bankruptcy crisis.</p>
<p>The grand jury focused on Merrill Lynch's role as the underwriter of county notes. The panel's deliberations have been kept secret, but rumours spread in recent weeks that indictments were likely.</p>
<p>County attorneys and Merrill Lynch declined to comment on the settlement.</p>
<p>Sources said Merrill Lynch's settlement with the district attorney would not have any effect on the county's $2 billion civil lawsuit against the powerful New York brokerage.</p>
<p>Sources said the settlement would also have no effect on the Securities and Exchange Commission's probe of Merrill Lynch and other investment firms.</p>
<p>As previously reported, SEC staff has sent notices to at least two senior Merrill Lynch executives, informing them they may be charged in connection with the county bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The $30 million that Merrill Lynch will pay as part of its settlement with the district attorney will be deposited in the county's general fund, sources said.</p>
