<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan central unworried by cash-driven stock rise.</title>
<headline>Taiwan central unworried by cash-driven stock rise.</headline>

<p>Taiwan's central bank said on Saturday it had no plans to adjust its stable-to-loose monetary policy despite a recent surge in stock prices driven in part by loose liquidity.  </p>
<p>&quot;The central bank has been adopting a stable-to-loose monetary policy so the (bullish) stock market performance has been expected,&quot; central bank vice governor Hsu Chia-tung said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has risen some 30 percent this year which looks a bit high,&quot; he told reporters. &quot;But that is because of the comparatively low base in 1995.&quot;</p>
<p>The stock market's weighted index has risen 32 percent in 1996 and has mounted a minor recent rally that has added more than 200 points or 3.3 percent since mid-November.</p>
<p>The index lost 27.2 points or 0.4 percent to 6,779.61 in Saturday's session, apparently unaffected by Hsu's comments.  </p>
<p>The November rally is widely believed to have been sparked by political buying by government funds and sustained by relatively loose liquidity in Taiwan's money markets.</p>
<p>Hsu reiterated the central bank's oft-stated view that loose liquidity was no economic cure-all, citing the inability of the stock index to break through resistance despite the relatively easy money in Taiwan's market.</p>
<p>&quot;The index has tried but failed to break the 7,000 point level,&quot; he said. &quot;That means the ability of liquidity to drive the market higher is limited.&quot;  </p>
<p>For this reason, he said, the central bank has no plans to adjust monetary policy unless a liquidity-driven stock rally begins to affect the Taiwan dollar exchange rate or triggers inflation.</p>
<p>&quot;Unless the stock market affects (the stability of) the foreign exchange market or consumer prices, the central bank will not take action,&quot; Hsu said.</p>
<p>The local dollar has been rock solid against the U.S. dollar since a short-lived depreciation at mid-year. The consumer price index has been stable at just above 3 percent since bad weather pushed prices temporarily higher in July and August.  </p>
<p>Hsu's comments were the first by Taiwan's central bank since comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan sent stock prices tumbling on major world markets on Friday.</p>
<p>Greenspan had said in a speech in the United States on Thursday night that &quot;irrational exuberance&quot; in the financial markets could damage the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>His cautious comments shook stock and money market traders worldwide, who feared he was suggesting the possibility of higher interest rates.  </p>
