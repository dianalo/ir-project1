<headline>BHP continues to firm on steel shake-up.</headline>
<dateline>MELBOURNE 1997-04-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>The shares of Australia's largest company, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd (BHP), continued to gain ground in mid-morning trade on Tuesday after it announced it would close its Newcastle steelworks.</p>
<p>At 11.20 a.m (0120 GMT), BHP shares were 27 cents higher at A$17.65 on turnover of 1.3 million shares.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's reacting to the announcements that were made this morning. The tightening-up of the steel division,&quot; said Kevin Lourey a dealer at Melbourne-base broker, Peake Lands Kirwan.</p>
<p>Lourey said the market was interpreting the changes as a decision by BHP to improve its earnings.</p>
<p>&quot;I think it (BHP's share price) will now move back towards A$18.00. I think it's got further to go,&quot; Lourey said.  </p>
<p>In a widely-expected announcement, BHP said it would phase-out steel making at its major Newcastle plant by the end of 1999 and also close its Geelong rod mill and Sydney wire mill in the same year.</p>
<p>Another Melbourne-based broker said the news was very positive for the company but some investors were treading Carefully until they saw the reaction of unions to the changes.</p>
