<title>FRANCE: French spending to rise less than inflation - Juppe.</title>

<p>France's centre-right government would cap public spending in real terms for five years to reduce deficits and unemployment if it wins next month's parliamentary election, Prime Minister Alain Juppe said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Asked on TFI television if he advocated a five-year nominal spending freeze, he said: &quot;That would not be realistic. I said it (expenditure) must not increase from one year to the next in real terms. Later, spending must rise less than inflation so it does not eat into the national wealth.&quot;  </p>
<p>Juppe said the government would need to take extra savings measures to meet the criteria for joining a single European currency by 1999, but he ruled out tax increases, saying President Jacques Chirac had explicitly excluded that course.</p>
<p>Within 40 days after the election, to be held on May 25 and June 1, the new government would set a five-year framework for state spending and revenues, with a view to stabilising expenditure, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;The state cannot go on spending more year after year. You will have noticed the countries with the highest unemployment rates are the countries with the highest level of public spending. So we have to stabilise that,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>With growth forecast at three percent next year, the government would have room to cut taxes beyond what had been done so far and to reduce deficits further, he said.</p>
