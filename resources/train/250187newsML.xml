<p>Despite an expected drop in Morocco's public foreign debt drop to $22 billion at the end of this year from 1995. Morocco's finance minister said the debt will still weigh heavily on the economy.</p>
<p>In remarks published in Le Matin du Sahara on Wednesday, Mohamed Kabbaj said the debt had been cut by three billion dirhams ($340 million) from 1995.</p>
<p>&quot;The charges of the debt, despite their drop, continue to weigh heavily on the national economy,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Payments of principal and interest should reach 26 billion dirhams in 1996 compared to 29.9 billion dirhams in 1995,&quot; he said, adding that compared to current balance of payments receipts, debt service represented 25 percent against 33 percent last year.</p>
<p>&quot;In relation to gross national product, the outstanding debt represents 60 percent against 69 percent in 1995 and 123 percent in 1985,&quot; the minister added.</p>
<p>Morocco was restructuring its debt. Some had been converted into private investment, with part of the debt with France totalling 600 million French francs ($115 million).</p>
<p>&quot;Out of this, some 218.1 million have already been allocated and concern seven projects which should generate a total investment of 760 million dirhams.&quot;</p>
<p>The same had been done with Spain for some $50 million worth of debt.</p>
<p>&quot;This mechanism brings two advantages. It enables us, at the same time, to attract foreign investments by reducing their financing cost and also reduces outstanding Moroccan debt,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>There was also a French loan of 1.5 billion francs, partly guaranteed by France, and the &quot;cancellation-conversion&quot; of 400 million francs into public investment.</p>
<p>The conversion value of this in dirhams was being put into a fund for development projects in the north of Morocco.</p>
<p>Internal debt, which the minister said had taken an important place in Treasury financing, rose to 102.5 billion dirhams at the end of last November, a rise of 6.9 percent compared with the end of December 1995.</p>
<p>($1 = 8.8 dirhams) ($1=5.218 French Franc)</p>
