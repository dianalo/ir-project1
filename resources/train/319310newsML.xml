<title>UK: Police said to warn British sports stars on bombs.</title>
<headline>Police said to warn British sports stars on bombs.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-01-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>British police were on Monday advising potential victims targetted by suspected Danish neo-Nazis in a planned letter bomb campaign against sports personalities in mixed-race marriages.</p>
<p>Danish officials said a group of seven neo-Nazis were held at the weekend after police seized three letter bombs -- explosive devices hidden in video cassettes -- posted in Sweden to addresses in London.</p>
<p>British newspapers said that among those targetted were former heavyweight boxing champion Frank Bruno, swimmer turned television presenter Sharron Davies and England international footballer Paul Ince.</p>
<p>Bruno and Ince are black while their wives, Laura and Claire, are white. Davies is white and married to black athlete Derek Redmond.</p>
<p>Redmond said: &quot;Obviously, it is upsetting, but it's not the first time something like this has happened. Unfortunately it is unlikely to be the last,&quot; he told the Daily Mail.</p>
<p>Danish police cautioned, however, that they had no evidence to support reports that British sports personalities in mixed-race marriages were the targets.</p>
<p>&quot;There is nothing in our material referring to sportspeople in Great Britain,&quot; Ove Dahl, assistant chief of the Copenhagen police murder squad, told the Danish news agency Ritzau.</p>
<p>The comment caused surprise as Danish Justice Minister Frank Jensen had on Sunday told the daily Berlingske Tidende: &quot;They were to be received by people known as left-leaning and by sportspeople married to blacks.&quot;</p>
<p>Jensen was travelling on Monday and an aide was trying to reach him for clarification.</p>
<p>British police would not confirm or deny the newspaper reports and said only: &quot;Police are liaising with the intended recipients, who are being given crime prevention advice.&quot;</p>
<p>This included tips on how to recognise a letter or parcel bomb and what to do if one arrived in the mail.</p>
<p>A Copenhagen court early on Sunday remanded five Danes in custody for 27 days and freed two on bail after a series of raids and the retrieval of three letter bombs posted in Sweden to addresses in London.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail said a journalist working for Britain's Channel Four television was also an intended recipient.</p>
<p>Danish police were alerted to the group's activities by Britain's Scotland Yard through a police intelligence clearing house in Wiesbaden, Germany, the Daily Mail said.</p>
<p>Danish police found neo-Nazi literature and symbols in Saturday's raids in Copenhagen and in a seaside village north of the capital along with detonators, a nine-millimetre pistol and a pump-action shotgun.</p>
<p>The only one of the seven to be named by police, 26-year-old Thomas Derry Nakaba, shot a policeman in the groin as detectives forced their way into his home.</p>
<p>Danish police are clearly unhappy with their Swedish colleagues' decision to detonate the three letter bombs but hope that laboratory tests may still reveal useful evidence.</p>
<p>&quot;It's certainly bad news that they blew them up but at the moment I don't think it is of very great significance,&quot; Dahl said.</p>
