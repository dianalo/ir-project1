<p>London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices are seen making a fresh tentative stab at the elusive US$2,500 mark later on Tuesday, base metal dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;I still think it will make a try at $2,500,&quot; a dealer for a foreign metal trading company in Singapore said.</p>
<p>&quot;It should go up a bit on some shortcovering this afternoon,&quot; the general manager of another firm said, adding he expected cash copper prices to gain about $20 on the LME.</p>
<p>Three-month copper was quoted by the trade at around $2,491/96 a tonne at 0230 GMT, little changed from the late indication in London on Monday of $2,490/96 a tonne.  </p>
<p>&quot;With very little interest noted, prices drifted in a tight 11 dollar range, lacking any real direction,&quot; brokers Macquarie said in their daily review.</p>
<p>Far East dealers said another projected copper stock draw, when the LME report comes out at 0800 GMT, should provide short-term direction for the market.</p>
<p>LME brokers Brandeis said the low level of copper stocks and supply worries &quot;should favour the upside in the short-term.&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;With the 10-day moving average now falling towards current price levels, it would not be surprising to see the market attempting to get above this level so as to spur technical buying,&quot; Brandeis said.</p>
<p>The base metal business in the region was quiet with the trade mulling the actual volume of Chinese zinc said to be in warehouses in Singapore.</p>
<p>&quot;Rumours are still going around about huge zinc parcels coming in,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>But another dealer said problems in getting export licences in China may keep zinc from being shipped to the city-state.  </p>
<p>&quot;I don't think fresh zinc will be coming here,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The volume of zinc in the LME's Singapore warehouse reached 20,650 tonnes on Monday, down 575 tonnes from last Friday's level. Dealers estimate about 20,000 tonnes of zinc remain off-warrant here.</p>
