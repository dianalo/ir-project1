<p>The New Zealand Government would introduce legislation this month simplifying provisional tax rules from the 1998-99 income year, Finance and Revenue Minister Bill Birch said on Friday.</p>
<p>Birch said the changes aimed to reduce compliance costs. The complexity of provisional tax rules had long been a source of concern to provisional taxpayers and tax practitioners.</p>
<p>&quot;The objective of the provisional tax rules is to ensure that businesses pay tax on income in the year when it is earned, but the current rules are a maze of thresholds, penalties and interest provisions,&quot; he said in a statement.  </p>
<p>He said he had no doubt business taxpayers and tax practitioners would welcome the proposed changes, especially the removal of the unpopular underestimation penalty.</p>
<p>Birch said the main changes would be -</p>
<p>* Removal of the underestimation penalty. At present those who significantly underestimate their taxable income pay a penalty of 10 percent of the underestimated amount.</p>
<p>* The definition of &quot;provisional taxpayer&quot; would be extended to ensure those who had overpaid provisional tax received interest.  </p>
<p>* The rules covering changes of balance date would be set out in legislation to provide improved certainty for taxpayers.</p>
<p>* Payment dates later in January  would recognise that many people were on holiday in early January.</p>
