<title>UK: Closing stock market indices.</title>
<headline>Closing stock market indices.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON</dateline>
<text>
<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended Monday.</p>
<p>LONDON - British stocks fell for the sixth straight session, as uncertainty about British interest rates and taxes and a weak start on Wall Street hurt investor confidence. The FTSE 100 fell 18.1 points to 4,575.8.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - German stocks also fell, hurt by profit-taking after Friday's surge. The DAX-30 index lost 33.55 points to close at 3,754.72.</p>
<p>PARIS - Defying Wall Street's downturn, French shares edged higher in a session dominated by technical trading on the last day of the monthly settlement. The CAC-40 index closed at 2,762.20, up 5.10 points.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Shares shook off early weakness to rise to record highs for the fourth day in a row. The Swiss market index closed at 5,587.8, up 26.0 points.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Stocks closed a subdued session mixed, with little effect from the G7 summit in Denver at the weekend, which yielded no surprising news. The 225-share Nikkei average rose 50.60 points to 20,436.14.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Stocks fell after a volatile day. The Hang Seng Index hit a new intraday high but retreated on profit-taking and nervousness over China-related issues, brokers said. The Hang Seng index closed at 15,021.23, down 133.13 points.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - The share market ended a lackluster session slightly weaker after a fall in the price of gold put pressure on the resources sector. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,706.3, down 6.3 points.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - Shares rallied on strength in industrials. The all-share index rose 52.2 points to 7,286.3, the industrial index added 57.3 points to 8,568.8, but the gold index lost 12.3 points to 1,015.1.</p>
