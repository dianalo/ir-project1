<title>UK: IRA bomb suspect to keep her baby in British jail.</title>
<headline>IRA bomb suspect to keep her baby in British jail.</headline>

<p>A pregnant Irish woman wanted in Germany for questioning about an IRA bomb attack at a British army base will be allowed to keep her baby with her in prison, the British prison service said on Thursday.</p>
<p>It said Roisin McAliskey would give birth in a hospital outside jail, in line with government procedure, and then take up residence in a special prison unit.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be in the child's best interests for them both to be located in the mother and baby unit. While prison can never be an ideal place for a baby, the unit offers a reasonably relaxed regime geared to helping the emotional, physical and all-round development of the child as well as teaching parenting skills to new mothers,&quot; Alan Walker, a director of operations in the prison service, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The daughter of veteran Irish nationalist campaigner Bernadette McAliskey, nee Devlin, 25-year-old McAliskey is currently in Holloway jail in north London.</p>
<p>Germany has applied for McAliskey's extradition in connection with an Irish Republican Army mortar bomb attack on a British army base in Germany last summer.</p>
<p>She is due to give birth in May and has become the focus of an ardent campaign by activists seeking bail for her.</p>
<p>Supporters say McAliskey has been subjected to &quot;barbaric and inhumane conditions&quot; in prison, but the prison service says her treatment has been &quot;appropriate and humane&quot;.</p>
<p>She was arrested in November in connection with the attack on a British barracks in Osnabrueck last June. McAliskey denies any link with the bombing.</p>
<p>The IRA called a ceasefire in its battle to oust Britain from Northern Ireland in August 1994. The truce was broken 17 months later with a series of attacks on targets in mainland Britain before the Osnabrueck attack.</p>
