<title>JAPAN: Officials demoted in Japan nuclear plant cover-up.</title>

<p>Five officials at Japan's sole nuclear fuel reprocessing plant were demoted for falsifying a report about a fire and explosion at a nuclear complex in March, Japanese media reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The state-run Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corporation (PNC) demoted five officials for collaborating to falsify a report on the March 11 incident at the Tokaimura nuclear complex, 160 km (100 miles) northeast of Tokyo, the reports said.</p>
<p>A fire which caused radiation to escape from the reprocessing plant was not extinguished properly and caused an explosion at the facility 10 hours later.</p>
<p>The explosion exposed 37 workers to small doses of radiation and was dubbed the nation's worst nuclear disaster.</p>
<p>On Saturday, PNC President Toshiyuki Kondo submitted a report on an in-house probe of the cover-up and apologized to Science and Technology Agency chief Riichiro Chikaoka.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot find the right words of apology,&quot; Kondo was quoted as telling Chikaoka. The agency overseas PNC operations.</p>
<p>The PNC also announced it has demoted a department chief and four lower-level managers for refusing requests by their subordinates to retract an error in an initial report about the fire, Japanese media reported.</p>
<p>In the initial report submitted to the government, the PNC said workers had visually checked to ensure the fire had been put out. The PNC conceded last week that this was untrue.</p>
<p>According to PNC investigations, 15 PNC employees, including the six managers, were involved in falsifying the report.</p>
<p>The daily Yomiuri Shimbun reported that Ibaraki prefectural police and prosecutors have launched an investigation to determine whether the PNC violated laws regulating the operation of nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>A furious Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto last week ordered a raid on PNC headquarters after PNC executives admitted the deception.</p>
<p>Hashimoto has said there will be a full probe by independent consultants into the accident, and other senior government officials have called for a complete review of the organization, including a possible break-up of the operation.</p>
<p>Public confidence in the PNC had already been seriously shaken by a coolant leak in December 1995 at its prototype fast-breeder reactor, Monju. No one was hurt in that accident and there was no radiation leakage.</p>
