<p>China on Thursday accused some U.S. opponents of its Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status of trying to politicise the trade issue and use it to interfere in Beijing's internal affairs.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some people in the U.S. who attempt to politicise the MFN issue and use it as a means to interfere in China's internal affairs and pressure China,&quot; the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;We strongly oppose such a practice, which is unwise and will not succeed,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The ministry was responding to a request for comment on statements by U.S. House of Representatives Democratic leader Richard Gephardt who urged Congress to revoke China's trading privileges.</p>
<p>Gephardt on Tuesday lashed out at Beijing for its human rights record and its trade policies, saying Washington needed a policy of &quot;firm engagement&quot; that demanded improvement in human rights and labour issues.</p>
<p>The Missouri congressman also accused China of &quot;blackmailing&quot; foreign companies into giving it technology and trade secrets.</p>
<p>The yearly debate over China's trade status with the United States was counter to Washington's own interests, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai told a news briefing.</p>
<p>&quot;There are some people in the United States who every year take out Most Favoured Nation treatment as a problem to stir up once more,&quot; Cui said.</p>
<p>&quot;In reality, this causes a lot of obstacles to U.S. trade and certainly does not accord with the own interests of the United States,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton announced on May 19 that he would extend for another year China's MFN status, which allows lower duties on imports from China.</p>
<p>Opponents were expected to mount the fiercest congressional fight over the issue in years.</p>
<p>Beijing repeated its praise for Clinton's decision, calling it a wise and welcome move.</p>
<p>It also said MFN, which the U.S. extends to nearly all of its trading partners, was normal and mutually beneficial.</p>
<p>&quot;MFN is the basis to develop the Sino-American trade relationship and serves the fundamental interests of the Chinese and American people,&quot; the ministry said.</p>
<p>Loss of MFN status would send import duties soaring and would affect billions of dollars of Beijing's trade with the United States.</p>
<p>China had a trade surplus of about $40 billion with the United States last year, according to U.S. trade data. Some estimates put this year's surplus at more than $50 billion.</p>
