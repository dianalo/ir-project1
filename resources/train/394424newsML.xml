<p>Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz visited NATO and the European Union on Friday to push his country's case for membership of the two Western clubs.</p>
<p>He came away confident agreement could be wrapped up on membership of the NATO military alliance this year, but remained circumspect on the deadline for crossing the EU's threshold.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe that we can get the agreement even this year,&quot; he told a news conference, saying NATO Secretary General Javier Solana had echoed remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright this week about a year-end finish to NATO expansion talks.</p>
<p>&quot;We have to remember it's technically much much less complicated than the EU negotiations,&quot; he said, referring to the laborious process of EU entry negotiations, which cover everything from agriculture to trade and environmental policy.</p>
<p>At a Madrid summit in July,  NATO will invite a number of Eastern European countries - widely expected to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech republic -- to join the alliance.</p>
<p>In the case of the European Union the timetable is less clear, and depends largely on the successful conclusion of the EU's ongoing inter-governmental review of its treaty, which in theory should wrap up at the EU's June Amsterdam summit.</p>
<p>European Commission President Jacques Santer told Cimoszewicz the EU executive was drawing up individual advice on each of 10 eastern European applicant countries for submission to EU governments after the conference ends.</p>
<p>But he made no promises about with whom the EU will negotiate and when.</p>
<p>Cimoszewicz said that while he hoped assurances from French President Jacques Chirac that a number of eastern European countries could cross the threshold at the millenium would come true, Poland was not counting on it.</p>
<p>&quot;We appreciate very much the repeated position of President Chirac. I believe that scenario can be fullfilled, but I always answer that from my point of view...the problem is when we start negotiations,&quot; he said, pointing to the laborious task ahead.</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom in Brussels is that it will be the year 2002 before the EU takes in any new members. Poland is generally seen as among the favourites for the first entrants.</p>
<p>He said he thought ratification of the NATO accession accords would make the expansion possible in April 1999 and said he doubted that NATO member Turkey would carry out a threat to block expansion of the alliance, in its bid to pressure the EU to take its own application more seriously.</p>
<p>Earlier, talking to NATO ambassadors, he urged the major Western powers not to cut a deal with Russia over the heads of other countries in order to sooth its opposition to NATO enlargement.</p>
<p>Albright said earlier on Friday she had made important progress on a deal with Russia which is designed to overcome Moscow's hostility.</p>
