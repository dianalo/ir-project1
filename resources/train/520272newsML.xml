<headline>RTF slides as Latvian market loses ground.</headline>

<p>Latvian share trade was slightly higher on Friday although most shares fell and further losses were in sight, dealers said.</p>
<p>Total turnover came to 92,000 lats against 86,000 and the Rietumu Bank index lost 2.48 percent to 188.03.</p>
<p>&quot;Activity is going over to the voucher market as the privatisation of the big state enterprises is to come soon,&quot; Aldis Sipols, head of equities at Savings Bank, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Riga Transport Fleet was most traded and the biggest faller, losing 14 percent to 1.23 lats on turnover of 26,900 lats.</p>
<p>&quot;A (1996) profit figure of 120,000 lats for a company with 17 million of own capital seems to be suspiciously low,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Another dealer said the market was also disappointed with a lack of information from RTF and that its year profit figures were coming in below earlier, more optimistic forecasts.</p>
<p>Unibanka reported its first quarter undivided profit of 1.4 million lats against 2.46 million lats after the market session ended. During trade, it lost three santimes to 3.75 lats on turnover of 20,800 lats.</p>
<p>&quot;If the profit is lower, that means earnings per share might go down, dragging the share price with it,&quot; Sipols said.</p>
<p>Daugavpils Chain was also active on 12,400 lats as it held its shareholder meeting. It lost 1.1 percent to 2.65 lats.</p>
<p>Salacgriva fish cannery slipped 1.4 percent to 5 lats on turnover of 9,500 lats.</p>
<p>Another dealers said shares were likely to stay quiet next week with many companies preparing for shareholder meetings although prices should be stable.</p>
<p>Market attention was also focused on when Riga Shipyard would come to the market, with a decision expected today on whether it would join the official list or not.</p>
<p>A stake in Riga Shipyard was earlier this week sold for cash at 1.39 lats a share.</p>
<p>&quot;I suppose it (the listing of Riga Shipping) will help the market,&quot; said one trader.</p>
