<p>Czech President Vaclav Havel said on Tuesday he had invited South African President Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama, Microsoft boss Bill Gates and others to a conference on mankind at the end of the millennium.</p>
<p>The three-day conference, organised jointly by Havel and Nobel Peace Prize winner Elie Wiesel, will be called Forum 2000 and will be held in Prague in September.</p>
<p>Mother Theresa, Russian author Alexander Solzhenitsyn and former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger have also been invited, Havel's office said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have invited to this conference over 100 prominent personalities from all over the world, people who have been thinking about the situation of man and mankind at the end of this millennium,&quot; Havel told journalists.</p>
<p>&quot;There are several Nobel Prize winners among them, philosophers and representatives of different religions, including the Dalai Lama,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Havel, a former dissident playwright who spent five years in jail under the Czechoslovak communist authorities, has angered China several times due to his friendly contacts with the Dalai Lama, who visited Prague in 1990.</p>
<p>Havel has repeatedly said he would welcome discussions between China and Tibet on the autonomy of the region.</p>
<p>The conference would not deal with particular political issues, Havel said, nor do the organisers expect a joint statement to come out of it.</p>
<p>&quot;The topic (is) ... to take stock, to bring together the minds and the souls and the spirits of great men and women of all over the world, to look together at the mistakes that were made,&quot; Nazi death camp survivor Wiesel, who was in Prague to discuss the conference, said.</p>
<p>Havel said a part of the conference should also be a &quot;multi-religious&quot; mass in Prague's Saint Vitus Cathedral where representatives of all the main religions would meet.</p>
