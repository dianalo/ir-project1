<p>From a ramshackle tent in the shadow of Seoul's gothic Roman Catholic Cathedral, a former Paris correspondent for a South Korean newspaper now leads strikes crippling his nation's economy.</p>
<p>Kwon Young-kil warms his hands by two gas stoves, shielded from falling snow by blue and white plastic sheeting insulated with styrofoam.</p>
<p>The newsman-turned-unionist is out on bail after a stint in prison for leading a subway strike two years ago.</p>
<p>Now he has returned to the barricades, this time raising the stakes in a battle against the government of President Kim Young-sam that he says has stifled democratic freedoms.</p>
<p>For the moment, he has become the government's chief political adversary.</p>
<p>A stocky man, his head shaved in a act of protest, Kwon sits cross-legged on the ground conferring with his top lieutenants in the outlawed Korean Confederation of Trade Unions -- one a government agricultural economist, another a construction company manager.</p>
<p>The scholarly trio command half a million weathered labourers from shipbuilding to car manufacturing, directing them with portable telephones.</p>
<p>Kwon is a man of few words, but listens intently as messengers bring reports of strikes that have closed car plants and shipyards in protest at a new labour law.</p>
<p>Hospital workers and unionists at four big broadcasters joined the snowballing strikes on Tuesday. The confederation said 217,000 workers were now idle, up from 190,000 on Monday.</p>
<p>Kwon inveighs against a separate bill, rammed through parliament with the labour law, strengthening the powers of a spy body formerly know as the Korean CIA that once persecuted labour leaders.</p>
<p>&quot;Democracy needs two pillars -- freedom of association and freedom of thought,&quot; the 54-year-old Kwon said in a low, tired monotone.</p>
<p>&quot;The Kim Young-sam government has snatched both pillars away. The new labour law will kill the unions, and the law to strengthen the Agency for National Security Planning will impede our freedom of thought.&quot;</p>
<p>Kwon was in Paris filing despatches for the Seoul Shinmun, a state-run newspaper, from 1981-1988 and missed violent labour protests that forced then strongman president Chun Doo Hwan to cede democracy.</p>
<p>In those days, as now, Myongdong Cathedral with its red-brick spires was a refuge for militant workers and radical students battling authorities.</p>
<p>Union leaders hope the sacred grounds will provide immunity against police batons.</p>
<p>Newspapers litter the floor of Kwon's command headquarters. Union leaders comb their pages, reading by the light of two bare 100 watt bulbs, to gauge the media response to snowballing strikes. Public opinion is key as they plot their moves.</p>
<p>Outside the tent, Daewoo Motors workers warm themselves around a rusty oil drum full of blazing cardboard boxes. Steel rods in hand, they protect their commanders around the clock, ready to repel any attempt by police to charge the tent and arrest its occupants.</p>
<p>The entrance to the church grounds is barricaded by Kia Motors workers.</p>
<p>State prosecutors have issued summonses to Kwon and dozens of his fellow unionists, who have ignored them and are now virtual fugitives from the law.</p>
<p>&quot;No one wants to leave their families and go to prison, but I am honored to be part of this fight and am willing to sacrifice myself,&quot; said union vice president Bae Suk-bum, whose eldest daughter studies at a U.S. college.</p>
<p>Another vice president, Heo Young-koo, the agricultural economist, said the current strife marked a turning point for labour unions.</p>
<p>&quot;Labourers are opening their eyes to politics by fighting the law,&quot; Heo said.</p>
<p>&quot;Strikes are no longer just for higher wages. Labourers will emerge as a political force, and perhaps even form a political party in the future.&quot;</p>
