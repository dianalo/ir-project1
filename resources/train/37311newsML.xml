<headline>KL shares end mixed, blue chips falter.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-09-06</dateline>
<text>
<p>Buyers stepped away from Kuala Lumpur blue chips on Friday, but second liners continued to pull in bids after Tuesday's sharp spill.</p>
<p>Cautioned by a nearly 50-point dive in the Dow overnight and the approaching U.S. monthly employment data, which was due out at 1230 GMT, institutional buyers of main counters largely stayed on the sidelines.</p>
<p>The key Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index ended off 2.16 points to 1,105.33. Meanwhile, the Second Board index surged 11.16 points to 554.39 at the close, after hitting a new intraday high of 554.84.  </p>
<p>Volume was over 219 million shares, and gainers led losers 330 to 209.</p>
<p>While the market was hit with a slew of corporate news, including corporate earnings reports, dealers said investors had largely discounted the information.</p>
<p>&quot;It's all been expected,&quot; said one market analyst.</p>
<p>William Chan, an institutional dealer with Seagroatt and Campbell, said, &quot;It's the (U.S.) jobs (report) that is worrying. If things are going too fast, we can expect an interest rate hike.&quot; A Reuter survey calls for August payrolls to rise 244,000 versus a 193,000 gain in July.</p>
