<p>Polish shares extended Friday's fall and analysts said the bourse could stabilise this week as investors wait for more details on damage from the flooding that has hit Poland this month.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market might be taking heart from the flooding's less severe second wave over the weekend but noted that costs from earlier damage were not yet counted.</p>
<p>&quot;Generally there's uncertainty on the market because of the flood situation...people don't know what will be the effect of (upcoming) central bank loans on inflation and other economic indicators,&quot; said Ewa Radkowska of ING BSK Asset Management.  </p>
<p>The Polish government on Monday said it may ask the central bank this week for a first tranche of 2.5 billion zlotys in flood relief credit.</p>
<p>No firm estimates of total costs of repairing damage have been given but a government body in charge of flood relief has said the losses would amount to several billions zlotys.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index fell 0.8 percent to 15,226.4 points and turnover eased 5.4 percent to 171.1 million zlotys on both markets.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market might prove strong enough to stay above the 15,107 points it fell to after the heaviest flooding.  </p>
<p>Analysts said Drosed, PEPEES and Bank Komunalny, down 10 percent, 7.6 percent and seven percent respectively in light trade, were likely hurt by weak June earnings data released on Friday.</p>
<p>They said a good sign was that heavier falls were suffered by smaller firms in apparent speculation by domestic investors.</p>
<p>But analysts said the upside from any positive impulses would likely be limited by the uncertainty linked with the run-up to parliamentary elections due on September 21.</p>
