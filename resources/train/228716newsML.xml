<headline>Poll picks Colin Powell as top U.S. baby-sitter.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Colin Powell, the retired general who ranked high in all political polls this year, is the top choice to baby-sit Americans' children, Newsweek magazine said Monday.</p>
<p>The person Americans least wanted as a baby sitter was House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who got only one percent in the poll, released in a special year-end issue of Newsweek.</p>
<p>In a poll of 929 adults, Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was the pick of 19 percent of those asked who they would most want to baby-sit their children.</p>
<p>First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton finished second with 15 percent, better than President Clinton's 11 percent, and Elizabeth Dole was third at 14 percent, far ahead of her husband Bob Dole, the Republican candidate who lost to Clinton in November's presidential election, at five percent.</p>
