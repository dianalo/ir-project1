<p>India's beleaguered Congress party on Wednesday turned to the widow of Rajiv Gandhi on the sixth anniversary of his assassination, saying Sonia Gandhi embodied the party's dynastic past and future hopes.</p>
<p>&quot;Congress is once again linked to the great family,&quot; party president Sitaram Kesri said to thunderous applause at the indoor stadium where he addressed a packed political rally.</p>
<p>He was referring to Sonia Gandhi's recent decision to come out of the political wilderness and officially join India's oldest party.</p>
<p>&quot;From the time Congress delinked from the Gandhi-Nehru family, it lost its way,&quot; Kesri later told reporters at a painting exhibition inaugurated by Sonia Gandhi.</p>
<p>&quot;Again when it got linked (to the Gandhi-Nehru family), Congress regained its true strength,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sonia Gandhi refused to answer reporters when asked what her next step would be.</p>
<p>The Italian-born Sonia Gandhi offered flowers at former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi's memorial in New Delhi shortly after dawn, and later prayed at the memorial of Rajiv's mother, Indira Gandhi.</p>
<p>The daughter of India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi was prime minister for 16 years, between 1966 and 1977, and again from 1980 to 1984, when she was shot by her Sikh bodyguards.</p>
<p>Rajiv was blown up by a suicide bomber while campaigning in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu in 1991.</p>
<p>After her husband's death, Sonia Gandhi, 50, stayed away from the political arena and repeatedly spurned requests to enter politics.</p>
<p>She limited her role to discreet meetings with Congress and foreign leaders at her residence in New Delhi.</p>
<p>But earlier this month, Congress announced that she had officially become a member, setting off intense speculation that the inheritor of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty was preparing to make a play for party leadership.</p>
<p>Newspapers speculated earlier this week that Sonia Gandhi would visit the site of her husband's assassination in Sriperumbudur, Tamil Nadu, on Wednesday and make a political statement. But her office denied the rumours on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Long dominated by the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty, Congress has held sway over India for all but five of the 50 years since independence from Britain in 1947.</p>
<p>But the party was humiliated in general elections last year, suffering its worst defeat and losing power. It now supports Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's centre-left government, but has no cabinet positions.</p>
<p>Congress has scheduled elections for June 9 to choose a president. Kesri took over the top job last September when former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao stepped down after being implicated in a series of corruption scandals.</p>
