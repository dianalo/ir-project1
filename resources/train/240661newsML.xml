<p>Unperturbed by the highest prices since the Gulf War, major industrial nations are guzzling oil faster than expected but surging supply from producers outside OPEC is beginning to quench their thirst, analysts say.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Friday raised its estimate for global oil demand in the fourth quarter of 1996 by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) to 73.9 million, up two million from the same period last year.</p>
<p>But world supply kept pace, jumping 1.3 million bpd to 73.9 million in November as a long-awaited surge in production from outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) began to materialise, the IEA said.</p>
<p>&quot;Almost 95 percent of the monthly increase occurred in non-OPEC production with the North Sea and Latin America accounting for about three quarters of this... increase,&quot; said the Paris-based agency in its latest monthly report.</p>
<p>Technical problems and bad weather delayed the start-up of a number of new fields earlier this year but the way now seems clear for sustained growth in non-OPEC output, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Global supply fundamentals appear to be the most bearish element in the market, with the startup of a number of small fields in the North Sea and Latin America,&quot; said Washington-based Petroleum Finance Company in a recent report.</p>
<p>&quot;Total non-OPEC production is projected to increase by... 1.9 million bpd in 1997, the latter just equalling expected demand growth, thus leaving little room for increased OPEC production,&quot; the IEA said.</p>
<p>In mid-October, oil prices hit their highest levels since the Gulf War of 1991 amid Middle East tensions, buoyant demand and fears that heating oil stocks may fall short this winter.</p>
<p>On Friday, marker Brent Blend crude in London was trading at $24.40 a barrel, less than 70 cents below the October high and still almost $7 above where they were a year ago.</p>
<p>Despite the expense, leading members of the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) like the United States, Japan, Germany and France saw stronger demand than expected in October, particularly for heating oil.</p>
<p>&quot;In October, U.S. oil demand increased by 1.0 million bpd or 5.7 percent from a year earlier, mainly due to gas oil and other product deliveries... In Japan, oil demand rose by 7.7 percent due to the effect of cold weather,&quot; said the IEA, the OECD's energy watchdog.</p>
<p>The rise in non-OPEC output and increased supply from the 11-member cartel itself -- seen by the IEA up 70,000 bpd at 26.14 million in November against its 25.03 million self-imposed ceiling -- was helping to trim the shortfall in industry stocks.</p>
<p>Inventories held by industry in OECD members rose 300,000 bpd in October, narrowing the stock deficit compared to 1995 to 67 million barrels from 83 million at the end of September.</p>
<p>But oil consumers gathering in the Indian resort of Goa for talks with producers this weekend will be disappointed in their hopes for a substantial price retreat in the short-term, analysts said.</p>
