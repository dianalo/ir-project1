<p>The Taleban have repulsed an offensive launched by opposition forces north of Kabul but lost some territory, a Taleban commander said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&quot;(Opposition forces) had secretly deployed a number of their groups and ambushed a some of our vehicles, but we repulsed the attack.</p>
<p>&quot;They had a plan to take the high ground and cut the road,&quot; said Mullah Khair Mohammed, commander of the Taleban forces on at the frontline at Jabal-os-Siraj, some 80 km (50 miles) north of Kabul.</p>
<p>&quot;Our defensive line here is unchanged, but we lost some artillery spotting positions and ambush points.&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The Afghan opposition alliance, based in the north of the country, said on Wednesday it had launched a major offensive and advanced about 10 km (six miles).</p>
<p>The alliance, consisting of forces of the government that the Taleban ousted from Kabul last September and northern leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum, launched the attack on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>The Afghan Islamic Press, a private Pakistan-based news agency, quoted witnesses as saying several Taleban were killed in the attack.</p>
<p>Khair Mohammed said that no Taleban fighters had been killed, and denied reports that 70 of his men had been captured, saying only three had been taken.</p>
<p>&quot;The opposition have captured a number of travellers on the road and are calling them Taleban.&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;We captured five opposition fighters and there were some dead bodies, which we pushed into the river.&quot;</p>
<p>It was not immediately possible to confirm his statement.</p>
<p>Journalists visiting Jabal-os-Siraj on Wednesday saw one captured opposition fighter in the back of a Taleban truck with his hands tied behind his back.</p>
<p>Khair Mohammed said that he was waiting for an order from his superiors to launch an attack against the opposition.</p>
<p>Taleban and opposition troops were exchanging salvoes of fire from Soviet-built multiple rocket launchers on Wednesday morning. The Taleban were targetting a ridge overlooking Jabal- os-Siraj, with the opposition hitting the town itself.</p>
<p>Few civilians appeared in the town on Wednesday. The Taleban have moved most of the civilian population from the areas north of Kabul, fearful of an uprising against their troops.</p>
<p>Tuesday's attack was the first major offensive on Jabal-os-Siraj since the Taleban took it from the alliance on January 23.</p>
