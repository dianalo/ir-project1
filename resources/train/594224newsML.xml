<p>IPE Gas oil futures closed higher on Monday as the market played catch-up with crude futures gains late on Friday, brokers said.</p>
<p>The June gas oil contract settled $4.75 higher at $177.75 a tonne, while July Brent was trading 19 cents lower at $20.16 a barrel at 1659 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;Crude's strength is it's main prop,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;It has to be said that most of Europe is out of the market today so it's quite easy to move around,&quot; said a second trader. &quot;Even so the overall trend appears to be up.&quot;</p>
<p>Most brokers considered the fact that July Brent had held above $20.00 a barrel was a positive sign, although many players wanted to see more volume behind the rise to substantiate the gains.</p>
<p>July Brent futures rose 86 cents late on Friday after funds moved back into the market, propelling it higher.</p>
