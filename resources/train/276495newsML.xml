<headline>YACHTING-BRINDABELLA BREAKS MAST AS FRONT HITS FLEET.</headline>

<p>Australian maxi Brindabella was one of seven yachts forced to retire shortly after the start of the 52nd Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race on Thursday as German yacht Morning Glory took the lead in strong winds and heavy seas.</p>
<p>Brindabella had just taken over the lead from Morning Glory when her mast snapped near its base as the fleet sailed into a southerly front with winds of up to 40 knots and three-metre seas off Sydney's Botany Bay, a race spokesman said.</p>
<p>Three hours earlier Brindabella, Morning Glory, Hong Kong pocket maxi Exile and Australian maxi Amazon -- all among the early favourites to win the race -- had been in a group of 25 yachts forced to restart after prematurely breaking the start line in light northerly winds in Sydney Harbour.</p>
<p>Brindabella, a 23-metre maxi owned by Australian George Snow, was also forced to retire damaged in 1993 and finished runner-up the last two years.</p>
<p>Syd Fischer, sailing in his 27th Sydney-to-Hobart race, also led briefly but was forced to retire when his 50-footer Ragamuffin tore its sails.</p>
<p>George Steel's 43-footer Quest was forced out with a bent mast. Quest and Ragamuffin were members of the Australian team which won this year's Kenwood Cup regatta in Hawaii.</p>
<p>Others to withdraw after sailing into the southerly change were Australian yachts Prowler, Innkeeper and Drake's Progress.</p>
<p>Ninety Seven, winner in 1993, withdrew after a collision at the start left her with a small hole in her bow.</p>
<p>Race officials said Morning Glory, owned by German industrialist Hasso Plattner, led about five hours after the start from the Australian yachts Sydney, BZW Challenge and Condor, which won the race in 1983.</p>
<p>Sydney, designed and helmed by Australian America's Cup veteran Iain Murray, was earlier the first yacht out of Sydney Harbour after Exile was recalled by race officials and suffered a 20-minute penalty for sailing on after it broke the start.</p>
<p>The crews aboard Morning Glory, Brindabella and Amazon all rounded the fleet to start again without being penalised.</p>
<p>Exile, owned by expatriate Australian Warwick Miller, later caught up with the rest of the fleet, officials said.</p>
<p>There appeared little hope of the 88 remaining boats challenging the race record of two days 14 hours 36 minutes and 56 seconds set in 1995 by U.S. maxi Kialoa.</p>
