<text>
<p>Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan Videnov on Saturday presented the resignation of his cabinet at a congress of his Bulgarian Socialist Party and said he would not seek re-election as premier or party leader.</p>
<p>&quot;As of this morning, parliament will have the resignation of the government. This will enable the Democratic Left to present for support in parliament the government Bulgaria needs today,&quot; he told the opening session of the congress  </p>
<p>Videnov said he felt he lacked the necessary support from the party and from society as a whole to continue as premier, and the congress would appoint a new cabinet headed by someone else.</p>
<p>&quot;I declare my firm intention not to run for a leading post in the party or the government,&quot; said Videnov, who became prime minister when the Socialists won parliamentary elections in December 1994.</p>
<p>He said he believed his resignation would help satisfy opposition demands that tough economic reforms be introduced by political consensus, while sparing the country the need for parliamentary elections.</p>
