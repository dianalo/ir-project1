<p>Trade diplomats cautioned Thursday that conclusion of a global pact to open up basic telecommunications was far from certain only two days before the Feb. 15 deadline for an accord.</p>
<p>They said optimism voiced by European Union and Canadian officials on Wednesday that the United States was virtually &quot;on board&quot; for a deal appeared premature amid persistent signs that Washington was not happy with offers on the table.</p>
<p>&quot;Right now, I would put the prospects at best at 50-50,&quot; said one source close to the talks. &quot;The situation is changing all the time.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It's not necessarily going in a positive direction,&quot; said another diplomat.</p>
<p>Other WTO envoys said strong pressure was being exerted by a U.S. team headed by Deputy Trade Representative Jeffrey Lang in bilateral talks on an improvement of market-opening offers, especially on the degree of foreign ownership.</p>
<p>&quot;I fear the U.S. is pushing the barrier very high,&quot; said one, adding: &quot;It may be too high.&quot;</p>
<p>U.S. officials declined to say where they thought the negotiations stood. The talks are being held under the umbrella of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>Success of the talks, the second effort in the last year to shape a WTO pact among about 60 countries accounting for around 91 percent of global telecommunications revenues that total over $600 billion, depends entirely on the U.S. evaluation.</p>
<p>Diplomats say that as the largest single world telecommunications market, the United States is essential for a deal -- and could again walk away as it did last April just as other powers said agreement was within grasp.</p>
<p>The United States argues that offers from other leading economies in both the developed and developing world have to be good enough to justify it throwing open its lucrative home market to all comers, as it has offered.</p>
<p>In a statement issued late Wednesday, Lang said his team was &quot;working hard .... to bring this negotiation to a successful conclusion.&quot; But he added: &quot;We still need to see improvements in the offers on the table.&quot;</p>
<p>The main focus of the U.S. drive appeared centred on getting key countries, especially Canada, to improve their offers of opening domestic telecommunications companies to foreign ownership by pushing the allowed equity level above 50 percent.</p>
<p>A senior Canadian official has said Ottawa's current offer of 47.8 percent cannot be changed, arguing that other aspects of his country's proposals made the package a very liberal one.</p>
<p>But diplomats close to the talks said increasing domestic pressure on the U.S. administration over trade issues might be making it harder for Washington to accept that line while offering a total opening of its own market.</p>
<p>U.S. Senator Ernest Hollings is seeking to prevent congressional approval of the nomination of Charlene Barshevsky as U.S. Trade Representative, a post she currently holds on an acting basis, by attaching conditions that could overshadow a telecommunications pact.</p>
<p>These would make it obligatory for President Clinton to bring any trade accords negotiated through the WTO to Congress for approval line-by-line, leaving them open to being picked apart and made unacceptable to other countries.</p>
<p>The senator is a strong critic of the free trade policies espoused by Clinton as well of the 1994 pact that set up the WTO and of the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement linking the United States, Mexico and Canada.</p>
