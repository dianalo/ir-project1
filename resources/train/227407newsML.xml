<title>FRANCE: French teenager jailed for causing train crash.</title>
<headline>French teenager jailed for causing train crash.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>A French court has jailed a teenager for seven years for planting a piece of metal on a railway line &quot;just to see what would happen&quot;, radio and television said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The metal derailed a commuter train, causing a collision in which four people died.</p>
<p>The unnamed 19-year-old, who has been held since the accident three years ago, told the court he had put a heavy piece of metal, left behind by maintenance workers, on the track.</p>
<p>He said he had expected the train would simply twist the metal and had not thought it could cause an accident.</p>
<p>Four people died and 27 were injured when the commuter train smashed into a local train in the morning rush hour at Saint-Leu d'Esserent, 60 km (35 miles) north of Paris.</p>
<p>The state prosecutor had sought a 10-year prison term.</p>
