<p>Leading Russian shares closed mixed on Tuesday on fragile Western demand and small volumes, traders said.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index of 21 issues rose by 0.79 percent to 183.39 on volume of $7.56 million.</p>
<p>&quot;It is a very, very quiet market,&quot; said Martin Diggle from Brunswick brokerage. &quot;Prices were marked up this morning, but there was no demand from the West and the prices fell again in the afternoon on very small volume.&quot;</p>
<p>Sergei Kosynkin, a trader from Bank Menatep, said Russian brokers did not want to sell shares as yields on Treasury bills fall, making stocks more attractive.</p>
<p>&quot;The West is not initiating demand and our people do not want to sell hoping for the demand,&quot; he said. &quot;Yields on the T-bill market are such that it is possible to invest in shares.&quot;</p>
<p>Diggle said the market would remain firm in the next few days, but he was waiting for more Western demand in mid-September.</p>
<p>&quot;This week it'll be fairly quiet but I think the market should be generally firm,&quot; he said. &quot;The market believes that there will be more Western funds coming -- it is a question of when, not if.&quot;</p>
<p>Mosenergo closed at $0.966 after $0.971 at Monday's close, LUKoil fell to $9.85 from $9.98, Norilsk Nickel rose to $7.75 from $7.70 and Rostelekom rose to $2.58 from $2.57.</p>
<p>Petersburg Telephone shed much of Monday's gains to close at $16.05 after $17.60.</p>
