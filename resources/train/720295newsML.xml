<p>South African Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals said on Thursday a study ranking South Africa as having the highest investment risk among the 10 largest emerging markets was &quot;a little bit unfair&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I haven't had the opportunity to study the assessment in any detail but what I gather from the Reserve Bank in Pretoria is that it is a little bit of an unfair assessment. We will disagree with a number of the assumptions made in that assessment,&quot; he told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>Stals was referring to a study carried out by DRI/McGraw Hill, released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The report said South Africa presented the highest risk based on data that showed a declining rate of growth along with rising unemployment and inflation. The country's mineral and agricultural output was stagnant or declining and consumer debt had reached dangerous proportions, it added.</p>
<p>But Stals said the Bank felt inflation had peaked and that it was showing encouraging signs of coming down again.</p>
<p>&quot;I think South Africa will say that we have greater stability within the political system at this stage than we've had since the reforms and transformation procedures started about five years ago,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Reacting to the study's comments about South Africa having high levels of consumer debt, he said he was concerned about the rate of increase in total debt extension by the banking institutions over the past two years, but that it was not dangerously high.</p>
<p>&quot;One of the concerns is there is a growing indebtedness of the private sector and the personal sector towards the banking system but I would certainly not see it as dangerously high at this stage. The level of the outstanding debt is not so much out of line of past history for the present stage of the business cycle,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>South Africa has recently had a sovereign debt rating upgrade and has increased foreign reserves.</p>
<p>But DRI/McGraw Hill chief international economist Nariman Behravesh said in the study: &quot;The general dismal fundamentals of the South African government and economy are expected to lead to poor long-term prospects for this country.&quot;</p>
<p>Stals, however, told RFTV, &quot;I think that the South African economy is in a period of consolidation, a short term cyclical adjustment that is necessary for the balance of payments.&quot;</p>
