<headline>U.S., N. Korea meet over bilateral issues.</headline>

<p>Officials from the United States and North Korea met on Friday to take stock of bilateral issues concerning the two nations, a discussion that a U.S. official described as &quot;very useful and businesslike.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the countries agreed to work in the weeks ahead on three issues in particular -- nonproliferation of missiles, locating remains of missing U.S. servicemen from the Korean War and opening liaison offices in each country.</p>
<p>The bilateral meeting came just two days after U.S. and South Korean officials held a briefing in New York to give North Korea details of proposed four-way talks to forge a new agreement to replace the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
<p>That briefing aroused fresh hopes that the isolationist Communist nation would join in peace talks with South Korea, its arch-rival on the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>Friday's meeting was distinct from the earlier briefing and was concerned with issues involving the United States and North Korea, the U.S. official said. The earlier briefing on peace talks was mentioned but not in any new light, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;Nevertheless the scope of the bilateral meetings today was exceptionally broad,&quot; he said, calling it a &quot;stock-taking, a general review of our relationship from A to Z.&quot;</p>
<p>The meeting lasted almost 11 hours.</p>
<p>The two nations also agreed to continue periodic discussions about their overall relationship, he said. No schedule was decided upon.</p>
<p>Kim Gye Gwan, vice minister for foreign affairs and the head of the North Korean delegation, spoke briefly with members of the media waiting outside the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, where the meeting was held.</p>
<p>&quot;We had very serious discussions on the broader issues concerning the bilateral relations for more than 10 hours today,&quot; he said through a translator. &quot;Both sides ... have agreed to have further contacts in order to pursue further progress in the relations between the countries.&quot;</p>
<p>The meetings are taking place during a tense period on the Korean penisula, where there has been a string of defections from the North and reports of famine and economic collapse in the Stalinist state.</p>
<p>The North Koreans brought up the issue of food supplies, but the U.S. official would not elaborate on what they said. The economic relationship between the two countries also was discussed, he said.</p>
<p>A meeting at such a high official level has not occurred since December 1995, he added.</p>
<p>The North Korean team plans an unofficial visit next week to Washington for private meetings, but official working-level meetings are possible with members of the delegation, the U.S. official said.</p>
<p>He said both sides agreed &quot;to pursue progress&quot; in the areas of weapons proliferation, recovery of remains of U.S. servicemen and establishment of liaison offices.</p>
<p>The United States has been seeking North Korea's cooperation in locating remains of missing U.S. servicemen. It also wants Pyongyang to abide by international agreements covering missile development and sales.</p>
<p>However, the U.S. official described Wednesday's briefing as more significant.</p>
<p>That briefing was convened at the request of Pyongyang, which wanted more information on the proposal made last April by U.S. President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young-Sam to hold four-way peace talks. Pyongyang had twice delayed taking part in the briefing.</p>
<p>The North Koreans did not reveal their intentions in the wake of Wednesday's briefing, the U.S. official said.</p>
