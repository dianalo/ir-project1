<title>MALAYSIA: Ringgit surges on Negara's presence, dollar sales.</title>
<headline>Ringgit surges on Negara's presence, dollar sales.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>The ringgit firmed against the dollar in late Asian trading on liquidation of long dollar positions by both offshore and local players, dealers said.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT, the ringgit hit a high of 2.5100/10 per dollar against 2.5240/50 for most of the day.</p>
<p>They said offshore players started selling the dollar at just below 2.5250, and were joined later by local players.</p>
<p>&quot;There were massive stop-loss sales,&quot; said a dealer with a European bank in Singapore. &quot;It was down all the way from 2.5250 to around 2.5100.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said the selling was triggered by talk that Bank Negara was looking to sell the dollar in large amounts.  </p>
<p>Some dealers said the central bank was heard offering the dollar through brokers at 2.5200 and below. This could not be confirmed as Bank Negara does not usually comment on its open market operations.</p>
<p>&quot;Negara is suspected of selling through brokers at different levels, the last being at 2.5130/40,&quot; said a dealer at a Malaysian bank. &quot;We heard he was selling $50 million each time.&quot;</p>
<p>Dealers said they were not surprised over the central bank's action as dollar/ringgit was trading very close to 2.5250, the level at which Bank Negara had aggressively defended the ringgit, for most of the day.  </p>
<p>&quot;It was a question of who would act or give way first. The battle may have just begun but Bank Negara has demonstrated it's not going to hold back its punches,&quot; said research house MMS International in its market commentary.</p>
<p>Some dealers said the central bank could have sold more than $2 billion since last week to defend the ringgit.</p>
<p>Dealers said that although stop-loss orders were seen at below 2.5100, they expected a rebound back to 2.5150.</p>
<p>The ringgit was quoted at 2.5065/75 to a dollar at 1030 GMT.</p>
