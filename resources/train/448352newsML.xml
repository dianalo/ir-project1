<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ bond yield curve continues to flatten at close.</title>
<headline>NZ bond yield curve continues to flatten at close.</headline>

<p>The New Zealand bond curve continued to flatten at Monday's close after what dealers described as an &quot;exceedingly quiet&quot; session.</p>
<p>&quot;The curve has flattened up about seven points from Friday's levels, largely on the view that the sell-off (on Friday) might have been overdone,&quot; one trader said.</p>
<p>Local bonds outperformed the U.S. and Canadian markets but were outdone by Australian debt.  </p>
<p>The 02/00 bond finished three basis points lower at 7.67 percent, while the ten-year bond was down 10 at 7.80 percent.</p>
<p>In the money market, the 90-day bank bills closed on its opening level of 7.47 percent, up from Friday's finish of 7.42 percent. The June futures contract was two points weaker at 92.39 with 1,561 contracts traded.</p>
<p>A 3.4 percent rise in seasonally-adjusted retail sales in February was above market expectations, but dealers said the series was traditionally very volatile and it was hard to read too much into monthly moves.  </p>
<p>The data did not significantly impact on sentiment, but Bankers Trust suggested it would reinforce the market's determination to keep overall monetary conditions somewhat firmer than the Reserve Bank of New Zealand assumed in its economic projections on Thursday.</p>
<p>The RBNZ assumed 90-days at 7.5 percent and the currency's Trade-Weighted Index averaging 68.0 over the forecast period.</p>
<p>Traders said the tone in the longer end of the market would be set over the next few days by sentiment in the U.S. as it heads towards the Federal Open Market Committee meeting on March 25. Debate is still alive and well over whether the Federal  </p>
<p>Reserve will tighten monetary policy.</p>
<p>One dealer said that in the larger scheme of things local yields seemed to have an upward bias.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe it needs to do a bit of work before it goes a whole lot higher than this, but I think overall we're still in an upward trend, and that's going to be reinforced by the fact that the U.S. is still looking a little bit shabby.&quot;</p>
