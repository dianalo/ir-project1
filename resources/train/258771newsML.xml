<p>Israeli shares closed almost unchanged on Monday in selective trading as investors cheered the low November consumer price index but expressed concerns about the political situation, dealers said.</p>
<p>The CPI rose 0.6 percent against a rise of 0.8 percent in October.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 0.05 percent, or 0.10 points, to 205.79 on all-share turnover of 78 million shekels against 70 million shekels on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index gained 0.01 percent to 213.77.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are sitting on the fence. The low CPI figure is very encouraging but the political situation is unclear,&quot; said Doron Tsur, head of research at Sahar Securities.</p>
<p>The Israeli cabinet decided on Friday to reinstate investment benefits to settlements in the West Bank after an attack in which a settler and her son were killed. The Palestinians have reacted angrily to the decision, increasing tensions between the two sides.</p>
<p>Tzur said investors took profits on the recent run-up in share prices, but he said the fact that prices did not decline despite lower volume shows investors are in a wait-and-see mood.</p>
<p>&quot;Investors are now waiting for fresh news as the market searches for direction after several weeks of nice gains,&quot; said a trader at the First International Bank of Israel.</p>
<p>Traders noted that the market moved in a tight range.</p>
<p>Elron Electronic Industries Ltd rose 1.75 percent to 12,408. Salomon Brothers said on Monday that it was retaining its strong buy recommendation for the company, saying that Elron was trading at a 32 percent discount to a net asset value (NAV) based on its analysis of future earnings in group companies.</p>
<p>The most active shares were Koor Industries, which gained 0.5 percent to 27,796 on volume of 3.7 million shekels; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which rose 0.25 percent to 151,439 on volume of 3.6 million shekels; and Supersol, which gained 0.75 percent to 7,968 on turnover of 3.4 million shekels.</p>
<p>($1=3.28 shekels)</p>
