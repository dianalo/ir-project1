<p>Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer on Monday said markets should be cautious about expecting any further U.S. interest rate changes after the U.S. Federal Reserve ended its 20-month easing period on March 25.</p>
<p>&quot;Of course we have to look at how markets will react, but one should be very cautious in expecting that this is the beginning of further moves, but of course it is all up to authorities in the U.S.,&quot; the head of Germany's powerful central bank told reporters.</p>
<p>The Fed nudged its short-term fed funds rate up by 25 basis points to 5.50 percent, its first interest rate increase in over two years.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer was briefing reporters after a regular monthly meeting of Group of Ten (G10) central bank governors, who discussed the recent U.S. rate move as part of a monthly review of leading world economies.</p>
<p>He said the governors also discussed market reaction to the U.S. Fed move, which raised fears of further rate hikes. But Tietmeyer said conditions on world financial markets now were different than in the 1994, when bond markets were sent into a tailspin, the last time the Fed tightened credit.</p>
<p>&quot;All in all we see the situation as different from for example 1994 because capital market rates are more on solid ground and we don't see any excessive developments,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The U.S. was represented by Fed Governor Lawrence Meyer, who was attending for the first time at the gathering held in the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS).</p>
<p>Turning to economic conditions in other parts of the G10, Tietmeyer said the central bank heads agreed that signs of growth were emerging in Japan while economic trends remained mixed in Europe.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer said recent gross domestic product data for the first quarter in Japan had been &quot;relatively strong,&quot; and the latest Tankan survey showed increasing confidence.</p>
<p>The latest survey released on April 2 showed corporate Japan in a more upbeat mood, but also indicated there were signs of worry about the future.</p>
<p>The G10, which includes 11 countries -- Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Britain, Canada, Italy, Sweden, the U.S., France, Japan and Switzerland -- was showing mixed signs of growth in continental Europe.</p>
<p>&quot;On the one hand the situation in the Netherlands is improving, as you know,&quot; Tietmeyer said.</p>
<p>&quot;On the other hand, most countries in continental Europe are in a structural adjustment process,&quot; Tietmeyer said, without naming any countries.</p>
<p>He noted central banks have probably done what they could in terms of helping the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;For the time being, monetary policy has not to play a special additional or changing role in those countries,&quot; he said. Tietmeyer has said in past that it was now up to the individual governments to contribute to growth through measures like labour market liberalisation.</p>
<p>He said central bankers believe inflation is under control in Europe.</p>
<p>The recent strengthening of the dollar had led to increases in some import prices, which could have an impact on inflation. &quot;But all in all, there is no inflationary environment&quot; at present, Tietmeyer said.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer also said the central bank governors saw no reason for concern about the current levels of foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not talking about the rates of one currency to another,&quot; Tietmeyer said. &quot;I am talking about the whole situation of the dollar vis-a-vis Europe, the dollar vis-a-vis Japan (and) the situation inside Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
