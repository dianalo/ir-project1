<p>Dutch shares finished stronger on Thursday, shrugging off an early shock from poor Philips third quarter profits as promises of tough restructuring boosted the company's shares and the index.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was buying interest in the market after Wednesday's slight correction and several stocks which had been under pressure recently were starting to look cheap and attracting bargain hunters.</p>
<p>Philips shares plunged around five percent at the open as the company unveiled a 77 percent drop in third quarter net profits to 123 million guilders.  </p>
<p>But the shares bounced on a wave of short covering and then moved ahead as Philips's new Chairman Cor Boonstra did some tough talking, promising to tackle the company's problems more aggressively.</p>
<p>Boonstra said Philips would turn around, sell or close underperforming businesses in its portfolio. The company announced a one billion guilder charge to cover restructuring in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Philips shares ended up 1.70 at 58.30 guilders. The AEX index was up 1.59 points to 585.16.</p>
<p>The AMX index of smaller shares was up 3.65 at 912.78.  </p>
<p>&quot;I'm really quite surprised by the way the shares have recovered,&quot; one trader said. &quot;People may be thinking the worst is over, but I'm not sure we see any evidence of that yet.&quot;</p>
<p>Generafairly positive, dealers said, with advances leading declines by 14 to seven. Investors were taking the opportunity of Wednesday's 9.54 point fall tar stocks, they said..</p>
<p>Copier firm Oce-van der Grinten gained 4.60 guilders to 184.60 after a recent slump on fears about its market started by dismal results from Xerox in the U.S. last Friday. Brewer Heineken also made up some lost ground, ending up 4.6 guilders.  </p>
<p>Swedish Compact disc equipment maker Toolex-Alpha also performed strongly with a recent big U.S. seller seen backing off, bringing in buyers betting on the stock having bottomed. Toolex finished up 1.00 guilder, or 6.29 percent. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040</p>
