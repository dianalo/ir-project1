<p>Polish shares eased in slightly higher turnover on Thursday but analysts said that though stronger buying after price-fixing signalled growth on Friday, it was not clear where the market would go from there.</p>
<p>The main market's WIG index fell 0.2 percent to 13,696.7, and turnover rose 1.9 percent to 84.1 million zlotys ($30 million) on both markets as 51 issues fell, 22 rose, and 10 were flat.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the bourse could extend its three-week horizontal trend as no fresh signals were in sight.</p>
<p>&quot;We are still in a horizontal trend and...I see no factors which could help create a clear direction for the market,&quot; said Mateusz Andrzejewski, an analyst at Pekao SA brokerage.</p>
<p>But others saw the positive economic climate as an impulse strong enough to help the bourse climb next week.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the market could pierce 14,000 points.</p>
<p>Analysts said the central bank deputy head's Tuesday comments on a possible rise in interest rates next year was bringing some uncertainty to the bourse.</p>
<p>But they said the uncertainty was unlikely to significantly influence the market.</p>
<p>Polish brewer Zywiec plunged nine percent in a 1.8-million- zloty turnover ($0.6 million) in reaction to Wednesday's unexpected surge, analysts said.</p>
<p>Continuous trade turnover was at three million zlotys ($1.1 million) with four stocks rising, one falling and one flat.</p>
<p>Mass privatisation NFI units rose 2.4 percent in 17.8-million-zloty ($6.4 million) continuous trade and fell 1.3 percent in 38.6-million zloty ($13.8 million) turnover in the regular session.</p>
