<p>Marina, a 50-year-old secretary in one of Yugoslavia's state-run businesses, pondered at the counter of a city department store.</p>
<p>Her dilemma: whether to splash out nine dinars ($2) on a sheet of colourful paper to wrap a favourite nephew's birthday present in, or eat.</p>
<p>She chose the paper. &quot;But tomorrow I will not have the money to buy milk and yoghurt for breakfast,&quot; she said. &quot;That is how we survive.&quot;</p>
<p>Her daily struggle is typical in a country where the average monthly wage is $130 -- well short of the $280 that the government estimates a family of four needs for food alone.</p>
<p>At least as far as the socialist administration is concerned, 3-1/2 years of war-time sanctions are to blame for the country's economic woes. End the remaining &quot;outer-wall&quot; of sanctions, so the argument goes, and the economy will boom.</p>
<p>Nine months after the trade embargo was suspended, Belgrade increasingly resembles other European cities, with shops full of famous-brand goods and designer clothes.</p>
<p>Young nouveau-riche with mobile phones and luxury cars are a regular sight in the town recently overcrowded with black market dealers trading fuel and foreign currency.</p>
<p>But as many economists predicted, the end of sanctions did not translate into economic well-being for ordinary people. Instead their standard of living fell even further.</p>
<p>One taxi driver said the only significant change for ordinary Belgrade residents is the return of traffic jams now that petrol is back and cheap. &quot;But people have less money -- oh, and the police have new uniforms,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Gordana, a mother of two who with her husband earns 850 dinars ($173) a month, said her family had never been worse off. &quot;Yesterday I did not even have five dinars for two notebooks for my children.&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;And we won't have money for the rest of the week until I get next month's wages. I don't expect things to get better soon.&quot;</p>
<p>Government officials are not so gloomy. They blame the sluggish return to prosperity on delays in rejoining international financial markets after sanctions were suspended.</p>
<p>&quot;We are eagerly waiting for the day after Bosnian elections when the outer wall of sanctions is to be lifted,&quot; said a senior government official who asked not to be named. &quot;We expect a dynamic economic revival after that.&quot;</p>
<p>The U.N. imposed economic sanctions in May 1992 over Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's role in the Bosnian war.</p>
<p>The economy contracted significantly under the sanctions, slashing Yugoslav gross domestic product to $15.9 billion or $1,500 per capita last year -- a drop of 44.7 percent compared with pre-war 1990.</p>
<p>Diplomats and local economists see mismanagement, war spending and corruption as more significant causes of Yugoslavia's economic devastation. &quot;The leaky embargo served as a convenient scapegoat for socialist leaders,&quot; said a diplomat.</p>
<p>The &quot;scapegoat&quot; lasted until November 1995, when Milosevic signed the Dayton peace accord on behalf of the Bosnian Serbs.</p>
<p>But a so-called &quot;outer wall&quot; of sanctions remained in place, blocking Yugoslavia's access to international financial markets and desperately needed funds, as a way of pushing both Belgrade and the Bosnian Serbs to meet their Dayton obligations.</p>
<p>While access to foreign finance is important, local and Western analysts say it is unlikely in the near future.</p>
<p>The U.S. says Belgrade's return to the world community depends on its cooperation with a war crimes tribunal in The Hague, and respect for Albanian human rights in the province of Kosovo. &quot;And this is a slow process,&quot; said another diplomat.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund is expected to link strict conditions to any loans, pressuring Milosevic to ease state control over the economy.</p>
<p>&quot;Milosevic must prove privatisation is going forward and not back, and that the dinar is stable,&quot; the diplomat said.</p>
<p>But even if investment arrives, economists doubt it will help the government boost growth of 2.5 percent in the first six months to its forecast of 12.5 percent for the year.</p>
<p>&quot;Any expectations of a spectacular revival of production and growth are groundless,&quot; said Zoran Popov of the Institute of Economic Sciences.</p>
<p>An acute shortage of fresh working capital is the main problem of Serbian and Montenegrin companies, Popov said. &quot;At least $1 billion is needed to kick-start production, but only if the money goes to economically viable programmes.&quot;</p>
<p>On top of enormous foreign and internal commercial debt, the national economy is also burdened with crippling illiquidity.</p>
<p>But analysts warn the central bank should not be tempted to print money, as it would create a vicious inflationary spiral.</p>
<p>&quot;Inflatory expectations are very high here after the experience of 1993 when inflation was 60 percent a day,&quot; said Jurij Bajec, chief economic advisor to the Serbian government.</p>
<p>&quot;The dinar must remain stable despite growing pressure from trade unions, pensioners, farmers and big monopolies for fresh money,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Last year inflation reached 120 percent. Since sanctions were suspended, it has fluctuated from month to month, but in the year to August, it slowed to 99.2 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Lifting sanctions won't help me buy new shoes and winter clothes for my children,&quot; said Gordana as she ticked off the hours in her office. &quot;And it won't help me buy milk or bread.&quot;</p>
