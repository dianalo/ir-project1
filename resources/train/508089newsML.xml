<p>* NZ debt rallies at close as hopes grow for benign inflation data on Tuesday</p>
<p>* Strength comes across curve, shorts helped by firm TWI</p>
<p>New Zealand debt performed an impressive about-face during Monday's session to close stronger across the curve, boosted by bullish sentiment ahead of Tuesday's key inflation data.</p>
<p>The 90-day bank bills rallied eight basis points to 7.57 percent and the June futures contract closed up nine at 92.25 on good volume of 3,337 contracts traded.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the short end was finding support through the currency's Trade-Weighted Index, which continued to hold in well above 68.65.</p>
<p>Hopes had risen that annual core inflation would be a benign 2.2 percent or less, following December's 2.6 percent.</p>
<p>Bonds also gained on the improved inflation expectations, with good offshore buying in the 7/98s and local buying in the 03/02 maturity following a bearish open in line with weaker U.S. Treasuries.  </p>
<p>&quot;The way the market's acting in the futures it looks like a bit of a short squeeze, or some position-adjusting going into the CPI tomorrow,&quot; an Auckland dealer said.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll of economists gave an average forecast of 0.41 percent quarterly inflation (2.16 percent annually), against the Reserve Bank's of 0.5 percent (2.2 percent).</p>
<p>The tightness of monetary conditions beyond that assumed by the RBNZ in March -- a mix of short rates at 7.5 percent and the TWI at 68.0 -- lent traders confidence to buy.  </p>
<p>Several commentators have suggested that if market players do not ease conditions sufficiently on the back of a good core inflation number, the RBNZ may step in and do it for them through a comment.</p>
<p>Dealers said a quarterly out-turn on market expectations of 0.4 percent might spark a rally of 15 basis points in the 90-day bank bills, but the currency's reaction would be muted.</p>
<p>One dealer said surprisingly strong data would leave the currency well bid and monetary conditions excessively tight, which would limit weakness in the money market.  </p>
<p>&quot;So really you can't sell off too far in interest rates, or otherwise I imagine you would see something come out of the Reserve Bank if conditions tightened up further. I guess that's why people have had the confidence to come in and buy,&quot; he said.</p>
