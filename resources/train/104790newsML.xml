<p>An exiled Hutu lobby group accused Rwanda's Tutsi-appointed government of assassinating two prominent Hutu exiles found dead on Wednesday on the outskirts of Nairobi three days after they disappeared in the capital.</p>
<p>The Rally for the Return of Democracy and Refugees in Rwanda (RDR) said Colonel Theoneste Lizinde and businessman Augustine Bujulifura were found dead in Kiambu district on the outskirts of Nairobi.</p>
<p>Kenya's police chief told reporters the bodies of two Rwandans had been found and they were apparently murdered. He said police did not know of a motive for the killings but were investigating.</p>
<p>RDR Executive Director Innocent Butare said the two men, who disappeared on Sunday, had gunshot wounds on their bodies.</p>
<p>&quot;Rwanda is responsible for these killings. The death of these men is a big loss for us and for the Hutu cause,&quot; Butare, his voice shaking, told Reuters in Nairobi.</p>
<p>Lizinde and Bujulifura disappeared from Lizinde's Nairobi home on Sunday afternoon after receiving a telephone call to go and meet an unidentified friend.</p>
<p>&quot;No one knows who the friend was and the two men never returned home after they left,&quot; said Butare.</p>
<p>Government and military officials in the Rwandan capital Kigali could not be reached for comment on the accusations.</p>
<p>Lizinde served as Rwanda's chief of intelligence in the government of late Hutu president Juvenal Habyarimana between 1973-80. He was jailed for plotting against Habyarimana from 1980 until Tutsi rebels fighting Habyarimana freed him in 1992.</p>
<p>He served the new Tutsi-appointed Rwandan government as a member of parliament and senior military officer before fleeing into exile last year after accusing the army of persecuting Hutus.</p>
<p>Butare said Lizinde was just about to complete a book on atrocities committed by the Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), now the government army in Rwanda, against the Hutu population.</p>
<p>&quot;The killings are no coincidence at all. Lizinde was just about to finish a book on the RPF. It was on his experiences with the RPF during the war and after the war. He was our main witness on Tutsi crimes against Hutus,&quot; Butare added.</p>
<p>He said Lizinde, a veteran of the RPF's four-year war against Habyarimana's rule, had only recently joined the RDR after arriving in Nairobi from the Zairean capital Kinshasa two months ago.</p>
<p>The RDR is backed by the 40,000-strong former Rwandan Hutu army now exiled in Zaire and says it has the support of an estimated two million Hutus who fled as refugees during the genocide in Rwanda of up to one million people by Hutus in 1994.</p>
<p>Analysts said the killings were likely to heighten tension between Rwanda and Kenya. Nairobi shut down the Rwandan embassy and deported its diplomats earlier this year in a row over the wounding of an exiled Hutu politician.</p>
<p>Kenya said the attack on Seth Sendashonga, a former interior minister in the post-genocide Rwandan government, was carried out by a Rwandan diplomat on orders from Kigali. Kigali denied any involvement and accused Kenya of harbouring Hutu criminals.</p>
