<p>Persistent anxieties over Bulgaria amid delayed IMF funding, a share offering from Russia, and a clutch of data from Argentina will provide the main focus for emerging market investors this week.</p>
<p>Volatility in the Bulgarian markets looks set to continue, with investors anxiously eyeing every move by the country's leaders for any sign that will soothe their nerves.</p>
<p>Sofia's failure to immediately satisfy the International Monetary Fund it was taking convincing steps towards economic reform meant the Fund delayed by one month a crucial $115 million loan tranche, amid concern over whether default on its foreign debt might loom.</p>
<p>&quot;The market has no conviction over Bulgaria and there are very few well informed fundamental holders,&quot; said one eastern European debt trader in London.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess we're clearly getting to a crunch point and the market's nervous.&quot;</p>
<p>A convergence of factors, including hefty debt service payments and big seasonal imports of food and fuel ahead of the winter, are putting extra strains on the country's reserves, while the approach of presidential elections at the end of October is adding uncertainty.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Dimitar Kostov was reported at the weekend to have said agreement had been reached for an IMF mission visit by the end of October, to conclude a programme review and set parameters for next year.</p>
<p>RUSSIA will otherwise provide the main focus in eastern Europe, with its debt markets likely to continue their inexorable rise in anticipation of a debt rating, probably before October 10, and a subsequent Eurobond launch.</p>
<p>Traders say the price divergence between Russia's MinFin bonds and its forthcoming Eurobond, with the market largely assuming the award of a BB rating, is forcing outstanding Russian debt prices higher.</p>
<p>&quot;The Eurobond is provoking a comparison between the domestic hard currency market and the potential Eurobond hard currency market,&quot; said one East European strategist in London. &quot;The difference between the two markets is still too big.&quot;</p>
<p>Russian equity investors will be eager for further details of the international share offering by Russia's RAO Gazprom, the world's biggest producer of natural gas, when it begins roadshows in London on Monday.</p>
<p>Equity analysts are expecting strong interest in the dollar-denominated security, which avoids both direct exposure to the rouble and the custody complexities more usually involved in directly owning Russian shares.</p>
<p>In LATIN AMERICA, debate is due to begin in the BRAZILIAN congress in mid-October on whether President Fernando Henrique Cardoso should be able to stand for re-election.</p>
<p>&quot;Congress is scheduled to start debating this this week,&quot; said one Latin American analyst here. &quot;While opinion polls show the population is divided I think the Congress will give (the president) room for manoeuvre.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile on Monday Brazil is expected to release details of a special purpose company to run state mining giant Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) for five years after privatisation later this year.</p>
<p>It will also announce the terms of the company's sale.</p>
<p>Investors tracking ARGENTINA will be seeking clarification on GDP figures after conflicting numbers for the second quarter were presented by the economy ministry and the secretary of industry.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be looking for confirmation from ARGENTINA on their GDP figures -- that could incite a little bit of intrigue,&quot; said James Montier, Latin American economist at Kleinwort Benson.</p>
<p>&quot;We should also get a number out of Argentina on the trade balance -- another trade deficit is probably due,&quot; he said, adding that import growth looked fairly robust.</p>
<p>The MEXICAN peso may attract more attention after President Ernesto Zedillo on Friday affirmed the country's commitment to a floating peso, and after recent comments on the currency by U.S. economist Rudiger Dornbush.</p>
<p>&quot;Mexico could attract a bit more focus this week,&quot; Montier said, adding September inflation data were also due.</p>
<p>And in VENEZUELA, the chamber of deputies is set on Tuesday to study the government's plans to use an estimated $2.5 billion in windfall oil revenues to pay off some national debt.</p>
<p>The IFC emerging market composite investable index, IFC/IPRD, denominated in dollars, was up 1.6 percent at 301.38 on Monday compared with the previous week.</p>
<p>Latin America was up 2.9 percent at 550.06, Asia was up 0.5 at 253.84, and Europe, Middle East and Africa were up 1.6 percent at 142.78. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 2734</p>
