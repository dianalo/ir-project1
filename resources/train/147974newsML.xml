<p>Pakistani authorities detained the leader of the religious Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) opposition party and his deputy on Monday, as police skirmished with JI demonstrators in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said local officials backed by dozens of armed police picked up JI leader Qazi Hussain Ahmed and his deputy Khurshid Ahmed from the latter's house in Islamabad.  </p>
<p>&quot;They have no written orders nor any right to arrest me...&quot; the JI leader told reporters as he was being taken away. &quot;Now there will be a campaign all over the country.&quot;</p>
<p>He said arresting Khurshid Ahmed, a member of the Senate (upper house), contravened parliamentary norms as the Senate was in session.</p>
<p>The JI chief was also a Senate member until he quit his seat last month as part of his struggle to oust Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's three-year-old government for alleged corruption.</p>
<p>Several hundred JI demonstrators eluded police to get within a few hundred metres (yards) of parliament, where JI had planned to hold a sit-in. Police stood by as the Islamic militants blocked the city's main Jinnah Avenue and offered prayers.</p>
