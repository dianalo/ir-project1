<headline>Ekeus calls for firm reaction to Iraqi violations.</headline>
<dateline>UNITED NATIONS 1997-06-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>Chief U.N. arms inspector Rolf Ekeus called Wednesday for a firm reaction by the Security Council to what he said was Iraq's repeated blocking of U.N. weapons teams.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters after briefing the council, he said Iraq's actions were &quot;a clear violation&quot; of Council resolutions.  </p>
<p>&quot;If Iraq is allowed now to decide what we should inspect, when we should inspect it, I think the value of the whole mechanism set up after the Gulf war would be put into question,&quot; he said, referring to the U.N. special commission set up to scrap Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction and ensure they are not replaced.</p>
<p>&quot;This a challenge to the whole ceasefire arrangement and a challenge to the United Nations, which was given the task by the (Gulf war) coalition to carry out the ceasefire. So I said that we expect a firm reaction from the Security Council to support the activities of the commission and by the IAEA (the International Atomice Energy Agency),&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Other sources said some council members were working on a draft resolution dealing with the recent incidents, which included blocking U.N. weapons teams from three sites they wished to search.</p>
<p>Last Friday the council issued a statement deploring an earlier series of incidents in which UNSCOM said Iraqi personnel aboard U.N. helicopters, or Iraqi helicopters flying nearby, had endangered the U.N. craft and their crews while assisting U.N. teams conducting inspections on the ground.</p>
