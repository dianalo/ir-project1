<headline>Hearings expose sleaze aplenty but no plots.</headline>

<p>By Alan Elsner, U.S. Political Correspondent</p>
<p>Four weeks of hearings into campaign  fund raising have exposed sleazy aspects of President Bill Clinton's  1996 re-election campaign but have failed to demonstrate any sinister  foreign plots against America.</p>
<p>The hearings by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee have introduced  a bizarre cast of characters involved in many incidents that Connecticut  Sen. Joseph Lieberman described as &quot;stranger than fiction.&quot;</p>
<p>The testimony has painted a tawdry picture of a Clinton White House  obsessed with the need to raise campaign dollars in unprecedented  amounts without asking any awkward questions about where they came  from.</p>
<p>Shadowy Asian businessmen and their contact men buzzed around Washington,  apparently eager to fill the need with foreign money, gaining entry  to the White House apparently almost at will. The key, and still unanswered  question is, what did they get, or hope to get, in return?</p>
<p>Utah Republican Sen. Bob Bennett thinks he knows the answer. They  hoped to gain status and prestige by showing they had access to the  most powerful man in the world, the President of the United States.</p>
<p>Republicans may have made a strategic mistake when the hearings began  by suggesting that espionage was involved or that the Chinese government  tried to influence the outcome of the 1996 presidential election.  Testimony has failed to substantiate either allegation.</p>
<p>It is precisely because there do not seem to be any vital national  interests at stake, as there were in the Watergate or the &quot;arms for  Iran&quot; scandals, that most Americans do not appear to be paying much  attention.</p>
<p>The testimony is often entertaining and occasionally surreal but it  only confirms the belief of many voters that all politicians are corrupt  and there is little new to learn.</p>
<p>As Democrats have repeatedly pointed out, if there was a nefarious  foreign plot, it is hard to see how it could have been more amateurish  and ineffectual.</p>
<p>For example, Commerce Department official John Huang, who came to  that job from the Indonesian industrial conglomerate, the Lippo Group,  routinely saw classified data and received CIA briefings.</p>
<p>He also often visited the Chinese embassy and submitted his taxi expenses  for reimbursement, hardly the act of a man trying to conceal his contacts.</p>
<p>Later, Huang went to work at the Democratic National Committee where  he rounded up hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal foreign  campaign donations by such subtle methods as persuading Buddhist nuns  who had taken vows of poverty to wrote $5,000 checks for the DNC and  reimbursing them.</p>
<p>Yah Lin &quot;Charlie&quot; Trie, a Little Rock restaurateur with a passing  acquaintance with then-Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, saw the chance  to hit the big time when Clinton became President in 1992.</p>
<p>He moved to Washington, engaged in a series of failed business ventures  and hooked up with a Macau-based tycoon and the Taiwanese-based leader  of a Buddhist sect.</p>
<p>Trie conceived the belief that he could expand his importance by donating  huge sums to the Democratic Party and to Clinton's legal defence fund.</p>
<p>In March 1996, he suddenly showed up at the offices of the defence  fund with $460,000 in checks and money orders in a manila envelop  and dumped them on the table.</p>
<p>Then he went to lunch with Mark Middleton, a middle-level White House  official, and gave him a letter on the state of Chinese-Taiwanese  relations to pass on to the President.</p>
<p>Clinton replied a month later with a &quot;Dear Charlie&quot; letter that was  a standard restatement of U.S. policy. For Trie, the contents may  not have mattered. What was important was being able to demonstrate  his clout by showing people the letter with its White House letterhead  and presidential signature.</p>
<p>While Democratic misdeeds took up most of the committee's time, Republicans  did not emerge unscathed. Three days of testimony demonstrated that  former Republican chairman Haley Barbour actively solicited a $2.1  loan guarantee from a Hong Kong businessman and then reneged on the  loan.</p>
<p>When Barbour tried to argue that he thought the money came from a  U.S. subsidiary, committee chairman Fred Thompson of Tennessee reminded  him that he made his pitch for the cash while sitting on a yacht in  the Hong Kong harbour.</p>
