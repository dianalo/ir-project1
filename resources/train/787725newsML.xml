<p>Brazilian Communications Minister Sergio Motta was due to undergo surgery Friday to remove a benign tumor from his appendix, his doctor said.</p>
<p>Professor Bernardino Tranchesi Jr. said in a statement Motta had checked into the Albert Einstein hospital in Sao Paulo Thursday evening.</p>
<p>The minister was also due to undergo a final phase of dental surgery, Tranchesi said.  </p>
<p>Newspapers reported that the tumor had been discovered during a routine check-up and that the operation was not considered serious.</p>
<p>In the absence of Motta, officials at the Communications Ministry were opening bids Friday morning for two more Band B cellular concessions -- Sao Paulo state and an area comprising the northeastern states of Alagoas, Ceara, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Piaui and Rio Grande do Norte.</p>
<p>A key member of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's cabinet, Motta underwent heart surgery last year.</p>
