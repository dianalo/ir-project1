<p>Lithuania's fledging bourse showed signs of recovery on Tuesday and dealers were bullish on the market's prospects for the autumn.</p>
<p>Volume on the central market was over 1.3 million litas compared with 128,000 litas last Thursday.</p>
<p>The central market, which seldom tops 200,000 litas, was boosted by the debut of state-run oil firm Lietuvos Kuras, which saw 240,000 of its shares traded at the price of five litas for a deal worth 1.2 million litas.</p>
<p>Dealers were tight-lipped about the deal. Lietuos Kuras is to be merged by parliament later this month with three other state-run oil sector firms.</p>
<p>Market leader Vilniaus bank, which is majority owned by the huge Bankers Trust, saw its price rise five percent to 1,050 litas and 28 of its shares were traded.</p>
<p>Brokers said that prices on the central market were on the rise and they expected the trend to continue through the autumn.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect to see prices on the central market continue to rise. A growing number of foreign investors are showing an interest in the Lithuanian market,&quot; said one dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;Some investors who have succeeded on the Estonian market are now eyeing Lithuania. Estonia's market is stabilising and Lithuania is looking more profitable.&quot;</p>
<p>Brokers also said that local and foreign investors were beginning to turn to equities in the wake of a steep drop in T-bill rates, which have fallen to between nine and 12 percent after hitting almost 40 percent in February.</p>
<p>Lithuania's bourse has yet to establish an index but bourse officials say they hope to have one this autumn.</p>
<p>The volume on Tuesday's secondary T-bill market was 93,500 litas and the yields ranged from 10.00 percent to 13.81 percent.</p>
