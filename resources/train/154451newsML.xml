<headline>Britain, France concern on jailed China dissident.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Britain and France on Wednesday expressed their concern at the 11-year prison sentence handed down by a Chinese court to dissident Wang Dan convicted of trying to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>&quot;We are dismayed by the heavy sentence that has now been given to Mr Wang Dan. His is one of a number of human rights cases which we have raised with the Chinese,&quot; a Foreign Office spokesman in London said.</p>
<p>&quot;We urge the Chinese to show clemency and allow Wang's early release,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Wang, a 27-year-old former student leader, was found guilty of conspiring to subvert the Chinese government, sentenced to 11 years in prison and deprived of his political rights for a further two years, the Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>He had faced a maximum penalty of death and a minimum 10-year sentence.</p>
<p>He said Britain would be considering with its EU partners what further action to take. Britain hands its biggest remaining colony, Hong Kong, over to Chinese sovereignty next June.</p>
<p>France expressed disappointment at the jail term and urged Beijing to soften the sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;Appeals for clemency and tolerance have unfortunately not been heard,&quot; Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;France notes with disappointment today that China does not take account of European feelings and concerns,&quot; Rummelhardt said. &quot;France joins its voice to all those requesting a revision of this judgment on appeal.&quot;</p>
<p>He added that &quot;the harshness of the sentence seems as shocking as the judgment against Wei Jingsheng&quot;, the father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement sentenced to 14 years in jail last year on similar subversion charges.</p>
<p>Wang, 27, told his family after the four-hour trial that he wanted to appeal.</p>
<p>France, seeking to foster ties with China as an export market despite worries about its human rights record, has angered Beijing this week by allowing a visit by Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama.</p>
