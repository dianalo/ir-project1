<p>Questions surrounded the death of a key East Timor rebel leader after the Indonesian military said on Thursday he had died of wounds many hours after being captured in a gun battle with troops.</p>
<p>East Timor military commander Colonel Slamat Sidabutar told Reuters by telephone from the capital of Dili that David Alex died on Wednesday night after he was flown to that provincial city for treatment.</p>
<p>Alex was believed to be the second in command of about 200 guerrillas from the military wing of the pro-independence Fretilin party, which has opposed Indonesia's rule in East Timor since Jakarta's 1975 invasion.</p>
<p>However, sources close to the East Timorese resistance movement said Alex and four other men had apparently been captured on Wednesday morning in a confrontation in Kaibada, near the second city of Baucau, about 100 km (62 miles) east of Dili.</p>
<p>Resistance sources said Alex was interogated before being flown to Dili.</p>
<p>Other sources in Dili said family members were trying to claim the body in Dili on Thursday afternoon, but some reports said Alex had already been buried in what would be considered unusual circumstances.</p>
<p>Sidabutar denied that Alex had died while in military detention. East Timor police said they were not involved in the case.</p>
<p>&quot;It's not true that he died in custody, but he died while he was being treated and was receiving a blood transfusion. Doctors tried to treat him, but he had lost too much blood,&quot; Sidabutar said.</p>
<p>He said Alex had received two large bullet wounds during shooting between rebels and local Indonesian army troops. He was flown to Dili by helicopter on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>&quot;He was a rebel leader who was sought because he was part of a group that had killed members of the community,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Sidabutar declined to give any further information.</p>
<p>Resistance sources said Alex was shot in the legs.</p>
<p>Australian supporters of the East Timor resistance movement on Thursday urged Australia's envoy to Jakarta to begin an immediate investigation into the Alex's death.</p>
<p>Ambassador John McCarthy has been on a fact-finding mission in the former Portuguese colony this week and was due on Thursday to arrive in Kupang in neighbouring West Timor.</p>
<p>&quot;We're asking the ambassador to go back and investigate what happened. He could hop on a plane and be back there in an hour,&quot; Rob Wesley-Smith, spokesman for Australians for a Free East Timor, told Reuters.</p>
<p>&quot;How can the number two man in the East Timor resistance be shot in the legs and yet die in the tender arms of the Indonesian military?... People who get leg wounds don't usually die. It needs to be investigated.&quot;</p>
<p>One doctor contacted by Reuters said somebody with a serious gunshot wound would have bled to death in one or two hours without treatment, but one source said one version of the events given by the military said Alex died early on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Amnesty International has said that torture or ill-treatment of political detainees in East Timor in both police and military custody is routine.</p>
<p>At least 35 people have died in various clashes in East Timor since late May, when Indonesia held its general election. Seventeen security force members died in one attack and human rights groups have feared retaliation against civilians.</p>
<p>The United Nations does not recognise Indonesia's 1976 declaration of East Timor as its 27th province. The U.N. regards Portugal as the administering power.</p>
