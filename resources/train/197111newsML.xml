<p>Germany said on Monday it saw no need to advise its citizens to leave Iran despite a barrage of anti-German protests, provoked by a Berlin prosecutor who accused Tehran of ordering the murder of three dissidents.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said Germany, Iran's biggest trade partner, had no reason to change its stance after a protest on Sunday at Bonn's embassy in Tehran.</p>
<p>Around 5,000 people marched to the embassy and threw eggs and tomatoes at the compound to protest against a German prosecutor's allegations that Iran ordered the 1992 killing of three Kurdish leaders and their translator in Berlin.</p>
<p>&quot;There were no attacks at yesterday's demonstration and we have no reason to believe that Tehran will not stick to its obligations under international law,&quot; Erdmann told reporters.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel spoke twice by telephone with his Iranian counterpart Ali Akbar Velayati over the weekend, reminding Iran of its obligation to protect foreign diplomats and other nationals on its territory.</p>
<p>Government deputy spokesman Helmut Schmuelling said it was too early to tell if the affair would have an effect on Europe's policy of &quot;critical dialogue&quot; with Iran. Kinkel is a leading advocate of the policy, which Washington views with suspicion.</p>
<p>&quot;It's up to Iran whether relations can continue as they are at the moment,&quot; Schmuelling said, adding Bonn had repeatedly made clear to Iran that Germany has an independent judiciary and the government had no powers to intervene in its affairs.</p>
<p>Schmuelling also rejected allegations in the Iranian media that Germany had been involved in delivering missiles and chemical weapons to Iraq during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war.</p>
<p>He said Bonn had not set up a crisis centre to deal with the safety of the 38 embassy personnel, their families and around 400 other German nationals in Iran.</p>
<p>&quot;We have not set up a crisis centre in order not to dramatise a situation which, from our point of view, does not need to be dramatised,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Erdmann added that plans had been made to ensure the safety of Germans in Iran in case the situation changed.</p>
<p>Trade ties between Iran and Germany were worth around $1.4 billion last year.</p>
<p>Germany's main opposition Social Democrats said the government was right not to bend to pressure over the trial.</p>
<p>The prosecution last week accused Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and other Tehran officials of ordering the shootings in Berlin's &quot;Mykonos&quot; restaurant and demanded life sentences for an Iranian and a Lebanese man.</p>
<p>But the smaller Greens party said Bonn was paying the price for being too cosy with Iran.</p>
<p>&quot;This regime tramples on human rights, sweeps opposition parties it does not like out of the way and blames other people for its actions,&quot; the party said in a statement. &quot;How much more is the German government willing to take from this regime?&quot;</p>
<p>Tehran has repeatedly denied any role in the killings and officially protested on Thursday to Bonn over the charges.</p>
