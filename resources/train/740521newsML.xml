<p>Malaysian rubber prices ended the week higher but activity was restrained on the back of a weakening ringgit, traders said.</p>
<p>They said prices could stay stable or fall next week depending on the movement of the ringgit.</p>
<p>The ringgit fell to a three-year low on Friday, hitting 2.6120 at 0900 GMT.</p>
<p>&quot;The prices have gone up quite a lot and I think it should either hold at this level or ease off a bit,&quot; said a trader.  </p>
<p>Traders said although the fall of the ringgit made Malaysian rubber more competitive against Thai and Indonesian, the depreciation was too fast for the market to grasp.</p>
<p>At the close, the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board (MRELB) quoted the benchmark RSS1 buyer for August at 236 cents (90 U.S. cents) a kg, up two cents from Wednesday's close. The SMR20 buyer for August was up one cent to 237.</p>
<p>The market was closed on Thursday for a religious holiday.</p>
<p>Traders quoted Wednesday price levels, putting the SMR 20 at 241 cents, SMR CV at 295, SMR L at 277, SMR5 at 248, SMR10 at 242 and drum latex at 193.</p>
<p>The INRO's five-day average price strengthened at 184.78 Malaysian/Singapore cents a kg on July 17, compared to 183.85 on July 16. The daily indicator rose to 186.06 from 185.86 previously.</p>
<p>Malaysian-based shipping brokers quoted freight rates for rubber from Malaysia to Rotterdam at $700 per 20-ft container, and $1,400 per 40-ft container.</p>
