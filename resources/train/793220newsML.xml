<p>UK natural gas prices eased lower on Tuesday after heavy selling on the IPE September contract had a knock-on effect into the winter.</p>
<p>A major shipper dominated selling on the IPE, pushing the September contract down by 0.210 pence a therm to the psychologically important 9.00 pence level.</p>
<p>On the spot market, first quarter 1998 saw the most activity, with several deals done below 17 pence, at a low of 16.90 pence.</p>
<p>&quot;There's a general bearish mood. September traded down which brought down levels in October and the rest of the winter,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>&quot;There was a feeling that above 17 pence Q1 was overvalued relative to the rest of the curve&quot; another added.</p>
<p>Prompt gas was heavily traded with one power generator buying more than half a dozen times on within day and day ahead gas. Prices slipped, with a day ahead deal at the NBP done at 9.0 pence.</p>
<p>October slipped about 0.10 pence a therm to trade at a low of 10.825 pence, and Q4 also slipped back to a low of 13.20 pence.</p>
<p>&quot;People are realising that there really isn't a real amount of genuine bid interest out there,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>Next summer was thinly traded, with two deals for the second and third quarters at 10.90 pence and 10.85 pence.</p>
