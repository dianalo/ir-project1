<p>Japan's new Democratic Party had a lead over the main opposition party in a poll published on Wednesday but both trailed the main government party.</p>
<p>A survey by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily, found 7.8 percent willing to vote for the Democratic Party, which will be formed later this month, while only 6.5 percent said they would vote for Shinshinto.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) scored the highest, with 22.4 percent.</p>
<p>An overwhelming 49.4 percent of those polled said they were still undecided on which party to vote for. The survey covered 3,000 people nationwide over the weekend.</p>
<p>Hashimoto is widely expected to call snap elections next month.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party, to be headed by Yukio Hatoyama, former member of the smallest coalition partner Sakigake, and Health Minister Naoto Kan, hopes to group liberal forces from, among others, Sakigake and the Social Democratic Party, the two other members of the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>Sakigake scored just 1.2 percent in the poll, the SDP 3.7 percent, communists 2.6 percent, others 1.7 percent and 4.7 percent did not respond.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, support for Hashimoto's cabinet was largely unchanged at 41.0 percent, down only 0.5 percentage point from the previous poll conducted in June.</p>
