<p>Dinamo Bucharest, knocked out of the UEFA Cup by a team of Icelandic amateurs, dismissed their coach on Thursday and put in his place a man who held the job two years ago.</p>
<p>Steaua Bucharest, salvaged some honour from a Romanian soccer system riven by scandal and a chronic cash shortage by clearing the first hurdle of the European Cup.</p>
<p>The 1986 winners defeated Bulgarian champions CSKA Sofia 2-0 on Wednesday to qualify for the European Cup second preliminary round against Paris Saint Germain 5-3 on aggregate.</p>
<p>But Dinamo fell to KR Reykjavik, winners in both the home and away matches, with an astonishing 4-1 aggregate against the Romanian side.</p>
<p>Club officials moved swiftly to sack coach Cornel Talnar. His duties were assumed by Viorel Hizo, 54, Dinamo's coach in 1995 before moving on to Rapid Bucharest, the Romanian capital's third club.</p>
<p>Also felled by a rank outsider were Otelul Galati, defeated by HIT Gorica, a newcomer from Slovenia, on the strength of two goals in the final two minutes of the match.</p>
<p>Both sides now return to the mediocrity and problems of the national championship.</p>
<p>Steaua, Romanian champions for the last five years, carry their share of the financial burden in the Romanian game but seem to be the only club blessed with adequate organisation and a proper training system.</p>
<p>Many sides have become bogged down in what newspapers have described as a &quot;black market of points&quot; negotiated between club presidents, trainers or players.</p>
<p>National team coach Anghel Iordanescu quit for a time last year to denounce what he said were &quot;strategic games&quot; organised by first division team officials. Club presidents, he said, were interested solely in acquiring villas and luxury cars.</p>
<p>The Romanian Soccer Federation has not escaped allegations of corruption either. Most charges against the governing body revolve around a scandal that it skimmed off 10 percent on transfer fees involving players moving to foreign clubs.</p>
<p>Steaua are now demanding the return of about $1 million taken over the past five years. But Federation officials say they have ploughed the money back into soccer.</p>
<p>Romania's new Sports Minister Sorin Stanescu has begun an investigation into the allegations but the Federation has resisted all attempts to examine its finances. REUTER</p>
