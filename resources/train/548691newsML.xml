<p>Australian farmers believe a ten-point plan proposed by Australian Prime Minister John Howard to settle native title uncertainties has brought a resolution of the issue closer but miners remain cautious.</p>
<p>Wendy Craik, executive director of the National Farmers Federation (NFF), said on Tuesday Howard's plan was still under close examination.</p>
<p>&quot;It's hard to tell, it's a basis for discussion. But yes I think it's moving closer to a resolution.</p>
<p>&quot;At the end of the day legislation has to be drafted and the devil is in the detail,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The NFF expected that draft legislation would be introduced in the June sitting of Federal parliament with passage of the law expected by the end of the year, she said.</p>
<p>Craik said Howard's ten-point plan, which had not yet been officially released by the PM's department, varied slightly from day to day on exactly how the ten points were covered.</p>
<p>The points involve: validation of all pastoral leases granted since 1994; extinguishment of native title on freehold, residential and commercial leases; denial of Aboriginal negotiating powers over third-party acquisition of urban land; pastoral leases to be upgraded and to prevail over native title rights.</p>
<p>They also involve: Aboriginal access to require current physical connection with land; reduced Aboriginal right to negotiate on mining; no Aboriginal right to negiotiate over acquisition of vacant urban Crown land and a tighter test to be imposed in rural areas; government controls over water management; overhauling of native-title claims process and inclusion of a sunset clause; voluntary but binding agreements to be established between Aborigines and other parties.</p>
<p>Craik said everything depended on interpretation. Some parts of Howard's plan could work very well for farmers, she said.</p>
<p>An example was the proposal that exclusive possession definition maps out areas where indigenous people have not been resident.</p>
<p>This would remove many pastoral leases from the argument, Craik said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Minerals Council of Australia said miners were still waiting for the detail of Howard's plan.</p>
<p>&quot;At this point they're just ten points on a piece of paper,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Howard has been attempting to resolve a major dispute between Aboriginals and Australian farmers and miners which followed a High Court decision of last December which ruled in a case involving the Wik tribe that pastoral leases and native title could co-exist.</p>
<p>Farmers have been pressing the Howard government to fully extinguish native title on pastoral leases.</p>
<p>Farm groups have said that native title uncertainty would affect rural production through blockages to farm business.</p>
<p>Negotiations between mining groups and aboriginals over native title have also unsettled or slowed new mine proposals.</p>
