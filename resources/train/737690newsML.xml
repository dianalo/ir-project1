<headline>Tokyo naphtha gains on stronger European markets.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-07-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Firmer European naphtha markets overnight helped boost Tokyo's open-spec naphtha levels on Thursday, despite little change in overseas crude oil prices, market participants said.</p>
<p>Near-term naphtha prices rose above $210.00 for the first time since early June, they added.</p>
<p>Open-spec naphtha for second-half September was bid at $210.00 per tonne, while offers were heard at $211.00.</p>
<p>It was traded at $209.00 in late Wednesday trade.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, first-half October changed hands twice at $208.50.  </p>
<p>In the low sulphur waxy residue market, fuel oil traders said Indonesia's initial allocation for August lifting was expected to total about 2.5 million to three million barrels.</p>
<p>Pertamina's LSWR availability for August is expected to be tight because the Balikpapan refinery is scheduled to remain closed for routine maintenance well into the month, they said.</p>
<p>They also said the state-run oil firm is likely to have few extra cargoes to roll over into August.</p>
<p>Pertamina is expected to announce its initial LSWR allocation for August loading next week.</p>
