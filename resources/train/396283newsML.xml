<p>President Clinton and congressional Republicans crossed swords Saturday on the merit of a balanced budget amendment with Clinton charging it could force Social Security cuts or tax increases.</p>
<p>&quot;We must balance the budget, but a balanced budget amendment could cause more harm than good,&quot; Clinton said in his weekly radio address.</p>
<p>Not so, said Republican Rep. Bob Franks of New Jersey. He said Clinton was spreading scare tactics.</p>
<p>&quot;That's outrageous, it's the worst form of demagoguery,&quot; Franks said in the Republican radio address.</p>
<p>The proposed amendment would require the government to balance its budget each year during peacetime and would make it harder for Congress to raise taxes, approve deficit spending or borrow more money.</p>
<p>The Republican-controlled Senate since Feb. 5 has been debating the amendment and may vote on it this week when members return from a recess.</p>
<p>The outcome is too close to predict. A key Democrat, Sen. Tim Johnson of South Dakota, said Thursday he would vote against it because of concerns about Social Security benefits, raising doubts that Republicans can prevail. The Republican-led House of Representatives is waiting to see what the Senate does.</p>
<p>If both houses of Congress approve it by a two-thirds majority, the amendment would then have to be ratified by 38 of the 50 states to become part of the Constitution.</p>
<p>It is no easy feat. The last great effort to change the Constitution, the Equal Rights Amendment, was defeated in 1982 after a 10-year struggle.</p>
<p>Clinton has been using the bully pulpit of the presidency to try to head off a balanced budget amendment in spite of the populist appeal for a government in Washington that ends years of red ink and only spends what it takes in.</p>
<p>He said writing a specific economic policy into the Constitution could force the treasury secretary to cut Social Security, or drive the budget into courts when a deficit occurred.</p>
<p>&quot;In a court of law, judges could be forced to halt Social Security checks or to raise taxes just to meet the demands of the constitutional amendment,&quot; he argued.</p>
<p>But Franks said only the discipline of a constitutional amendment to keep federal spending in check could save the retirement system, which faces huge deficits ahead as the post-war baby boom generation retires.</p>
<p>&quot;It's the only way to make sure Social Security stays solvent and can continue to send out the monthly checks seniors count on,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Franks said a permanently balanced federal budget would benefit all Americans by lowering interest rates on home mortgages and other loans.</p>
<p>&quot;The choice is now clear. Either we tie the hands of Washington and stop them from spending our money or Washington will tie the hands of our children and continue spending them into debt,&quot; Franks said.</p>
<p>Clinton said the opposing parties should simply agree on a plan this year that balances the budget by 2002 without an amendment.</p>
<p>Republican leaders of the Senate have scheduled for next week votes on Democratic alternatives to exempt Social Security and make other changes to the amendment and a final vote on the amendment itself.</p>
