<p>Cigarette manufacturer W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills Holdings Ltd said on Wednesday it did not consider the level of profitability achieved in the six months to June 30 to be repeated in the second half of the year due to continuing intense market competition.  </p>
<p>&quot;The company has had considerable success in reducing costs following a major review of its operations,&quot; Wills said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;However, these savings will be eroded in coming months by substantial expenditure to replace and modify the company's computer systems to resolve the millennium issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Wills, about 67 percent owned by B.A.T. Industries Plc, said its half year net profit to June 30 rose to A$12.88 million from A$6.10 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Operating profit rose to A$21.72 million from A$16.41 million last year.  </p>
<p>The so-called &quot;Millennium Bug&quot; is a global programming problem that could cause many computers to view the year 2000 as the year 1900. It is the result of a programming fault which only allows computers to accept the last two digits of a year.</p>
<p>While it was unlikely to be repeated in the coming period, the performance in the first half year had been good enough for directors to decide to reintroduce interim dividends, it said.</p>
<p>Wills declared an interim dividend of three cents.</p>
<p>The company expected competition in the cigarette industry to remain &quot;fierce&quot; and said brand equity and marketing was the best way to maintain market share.  </p>
<p>Wills noted that smoking bans in hospitality venues were being either introduced or considered by state governments around Australia.</p>
<p>In light of this, a publicity campaign called &quot;A Fresh Look&quot; would be staged to &quot;promote effective ventilation and air filtration as a means of accommodating both smokers and non-smokers&quot;.</p>
<p>Wills also said it would &quot;vigorously&quot; defend a personal injury case launched by an individual against it and other Australian tobacco manufacturers.</p>
