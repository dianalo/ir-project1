<p>TOP STORIES</p>
<p>- The prime minister and army chief have allowed Burma to dredge the Moei River in Tak province in a deal in which Rangoon agrees to open the friendship bridge. The standoff between Thai and Burmese forces at the dredging site, which was settled yesterday, comes about because field military officers are not informed of the agreement. (BANGKOK POST)</p>
<p>- The influential tycoon's son accused of shooting a man in a pub is warned to surrender to the police or risk decisive action. The warning to Suksant, or Man, Kong-udom, is issued by commander of south Bangkok police, after the Interior Ministry issued a warrant for his arrest. Man is accused of shooting and assaulting Assadamongkol Tantemsap, a nephew of the Thai ambassador to Beijing, at the pub early on Tuesday. (BANGKOK POST) (THE NATION)</p>
<p>- Growing public criticism has prompted 30 democracy groups to make clear their stand by announcing support for the draft charter. The 30 organisations resolved at a meeting yesterday to back the draft. But they also want charter writers to heed their calls for the new constitution to give people full power to inspect the state's use of power, and to truly participate in running the country.
