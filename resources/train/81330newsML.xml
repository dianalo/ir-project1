<p>Argentine President Carlos Menem dismissed a 36-hour general strike that began Thursday, and a rally of tens of thousands outside the presidential palace, as a &quot;complete failure&quot; that would not affect policy.</p>
<p>The Peronist leader, facing the greatest challenge to his free-market reforms since he came to power in 1989, poured scorn on the protest Thursday in Buenos Aires' Plaza de Mayo which unions say rallied 100,000 and Menem says rallied 40,000. He made his remarks in newspaper interviews published Friday.  </p>
<p>&quot;In my opinion it was a complete failure. In a city of 3.5 million people, ruled by the Radicals, for a protest of all the opposition and the CGT (union federation) to get no more than 40,000 people according to police is a failure,&quot; Menem said in an interview with Clarin newspaper.</p>
<p>&quot;I think Sunday's Boca and River (soccer match) will get more people,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The CGT, the largest labor federation, is a traditional ally of the Peronist Party, but called the &quot;Strike And A Half&quot; to protest 17.1 percent unemployment and a government drive for fiscal austerity and more flexible labor laws.  </p>
<p>The government has already pushed its tax hikes and worker benefit cuts through Congress, and is determined to introduce labor laws that would lower employer costs and give companies more of an incentive to take on staff.</p>
<p>Menem, in another interview to La Nacion, vowed to go ahead with labor reforms and said the strike &quot;changes nothing in any way. These demands don't scare anybody, least of all the government.&quot;  </p>
<p>There were no indications early Friday of what percentage of workers were observing the strike, which follows a 24-hour stoppage in August that unions said was 90 percent successful and the government acknowledges had 50 percent success.</p>
<p>Menem, who angered unions and opposition by dismissing the latest action as a &quot;tourist&quot; strike -- an excuse for a long weekend -- said he had flown over Buenos Aires and surrounding districts by helicopter and estimated only 25 percent of workers walked out.</p>
