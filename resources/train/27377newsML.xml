<p>A 32-year-old Manhattan woman has been charged with murdering her four-year-old daughter by allegedly starving the girl to death, a spokeswoman for New York's prosecutor said on Monday.</p>
<p>The woman, Carla Lockwood, has also been charged with endangering the welfare of a child. The child, Nadine, was found dead in her crib by police Saturday night after they responded to a 911 call that said she was having difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>Police said six other children, three boys and three girls aged one to 13, were also found in the rat-and-roach-infested apartment. The six appeared healthy.</p>
<p>The dead girl appeared malnourished with sunken cheeks, protruding ribs and patches of hair missing. She also had extremely thin arms and legs, the complaint said.</p>
<p>&quot;She has admitted to not feeding the child,&quot; Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, said Monday.</p>
