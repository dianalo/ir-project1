<p>Australia on Monday announced a 24-man squad, which included injured Jason Little and David Wilson but not Matthew Burke, for the first of three Bledisloe Cup matches against New Zealand in Christchurch on Saturday.</p>
<p>Coach Greg Smith said the squad would allow selectors &quot;options on all positions&quot; for the opening match of the Cup, currently held by the All Blacks.</p>
<p>The Wallabies, fresh from two test victories against Five Nations champions France, will train in Brisbane for the next two days before flying to Christchurch on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Burke, one of the Wallabies' most experienced backs, missed both tests against France because of a groin injury.</p>
<p>Little and Wilson were injured in a fiery match against France in Brisbane on Saturday, which the Wallabies won 26-19. Little was replaced in the second half because of a serious hip muscle injury, while Wilson had hip and rib soreness.</p>
<p>In contrast, the All Blacks had announced a team with just one change from the line-up which thrashed Argentina 62-10 at the weekend. The team boasts Zinzan Brooke, who will celebrate his 50th All Black test cap against Australia.</p>
<p>Australia - Steve Larkham, Ben Tune, Mitch Hardy, Joe Roff, Daniel Herbett, Jason Little, Pat Howard, James Holbeck, Tim Horan, George Gregan, Sam Payne, Richard Harry, Andrew Blades, Ewen McKenzie, Michael Foley, Marco Caputo, John Eales, David Giffin, Matt Cockbain, David Wilson, Troy Coker, Daniel Manu, Toutai Kefu.</p>
