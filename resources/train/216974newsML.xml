<title>POLAND: Foreign investors may get majority Polish oil stakes.</title>

<p>Foreign investors may be offered majority stakes in the sale of Poland's oil sector but they will be obliged to keep domestic fuel production levels, a holding group controlling the industry said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The group,  Nafta Polska SA, said in a report that small Polish investors would be allowed to buy minority equity in refineries, which could also place new shares on the bourse. @</p>
<p>&quot;It seems possible to allocate more than 50 percent of shares (of refineries) and include passive investors in the programme, as well as place a part of the shares on the bourse,&quot; Nafta's report said. </p>
<p>Nafta was created last year to supervise the government's oil sector sell-off scheme, which is likely to begin next year with the sale of between 20 percent of 30 percent of shares in the country's seven refineries. </p>
<p>Nafta controls shares of all refineries -- including two big ones,  Petrochemia Plock SA and  Rafineria Gdanska SA -- and will be given shares in the state-owned petrol distribution network CPN SA. </p>
<p>The programme provides for equity links between the refineries and CPN and thus investors in the seven companies will get access to the distributor's lucrative chain of 1,300 stations. @</p>
<p>Nafta said the largest Plock refinery will get 33 percent of shares in CPN while the smaller Gdansk -- 12.4 percent. The two refineries process more than 14 million tonnes of oil annually, which covers about 80 percent of domestic demand.</p>
<p>Nafta will retain 25 percent of CPN shares. @</p>
<p>The oil sector privatisation programme has been designed to attract nearly $3 billion needed for the industry's modernisation ahead of its opening up to the international competition, due in the next few years.</p>
