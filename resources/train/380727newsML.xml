<p>A Japanese TV reporter left a radio transmitter in the ambassador's home in Lima where hostages are being held by Marxist rebels, the foreign ministry said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The ministry said TV Asahi reporter Tsuyoshi Hitomi left the radio in the residence on January 7 when he sneaked in with his Peruvian interpreter, Victor Borja, to meet the rebels.</p>
<p>A TV Asahi spokesman said network staff in Lima made radio contact with some 10 Japanese hostages in late January and conveyed their messages to their families. The network did not broadcast the radio contact with the hostages.</p>
<p>The ministry denounced TV Asahi, saying the radio contact could jeopardise the Peruvian government's efforts to secure the safe release of all 72 captives held in the residence since December 17.</p>
<p>&quot;We have repeatedly conveyed our concern to TV Asahi that, depending on the way the radio was used, it could have grave impact on the course of talks between the Peruvian government and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA),&quot; the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Japan's Posts and Telecommunications Ministry summoned TV Asahi President Kunio Ito this week and lodged a protest, a network spokesman said. He did not elaborate.</p>
