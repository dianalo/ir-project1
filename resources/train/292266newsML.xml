<p>Crude oil prices in Asia were firmer on Tuesday supported by strong futures prices and continued shut downs of Australian light sweet crude fields.</p>
<p>Major 70,000 barrels per day (bpd) Griffin and 90,000 bpd Cossack fields were shut down overnight as Cyclone Rachel approached.</p>
<p>The 10-15,000 bpd Barrow Island and the 30,000 bpd Thevenard were also planning shut downs. The heavier 10,000-bpd Wandoo crude was also shut-in by the storm, traders said.</p>
<p>The output losses were underpinning Tapis paper, but traders said they had not spotted any fresh buying off the back of news.  </p>
<p>January paper Tapis was quoted at $25.60/$25.80, up from a day-earlier $25.25/$25.45. Brokers attributed most of the rise to overnight gains on Brent and NYMEX, but said the news would undoubtedly underpin the market.</p>
<p>Little fresh action was seen in the cash market.</p>
<p>A February Dubai cargo was heard on offer by a producer at quotes plus $1.00, with two partials offered at plus 97 cents.</p>
<p>A state-oil company was bidding the Dubai paper and overnight bought Feb/Mar from a European major at 65 cents.</p>
<p>Feb/Mar was assessed Tuesday at 55/70 from 63/70 in New York. The state-oil company was said to be bidding at 63 cents.  </p>
<p>Oman discussions for March barrels started in earnest with debate centred on the premium.</p>
<p>The Oman/Dubai differential widened out to $1.04 from 86 cents, indicating achievable premium could be 10-15 cents for March compared with plus 30 cents for February.</p>
<p>But Oman's 80,000 bpd refinery is on turnaround in March which will put some extra Oman on the market. Seasonal demand might be slower also, some traders said.</p>
