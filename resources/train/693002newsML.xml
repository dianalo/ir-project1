<p>Members of Congress who helped pass a law restricting indecent material on the Internet vowed Thursday to rework the legislation after the Supreme Court ruled it unconstitutional.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an unfortunate ruling and is a huge blow to those of us who want to protect our children from sexual predators using the Internet,&quot; said Sen. Christopher Bond, a Missouri Republican.</p>
<p>The court's decision did not rule out &quot;more specific regulatory methods,&quot; Bond argued. &quot;I believe Congress will try again and that we'll get it right next time.&quot;</p>
<p>The justices by a 7-2 vote ruled that all key parts of the Communications Decency Act, passed as part of the 1996 overhaul of telecommunications laws, amounted to government censorship in violation of the First Amendment.</p>
<p>Sen. Dan Coats, an Indiana Republican who was of the author's of the law, said the decision would allow &quot;immediate, unrestricted access of children to pornography.&quot;</p>
<p>But plaintiffs in the lawsuit, ranging from the American Civil Liberties Union to the American Library Association, denied that children were left unprotected.</p>
<p>&quot;This issue is about how to protect children and how to allow them to enjoy the incredible benefits this medium has to offer,&quot; said William Burrington, assistant general counsel at America Online. &quot;The way to do it is to empower parents with technology, educate them on how to use it, and enforce existing laws.&quot;</p>
<p>Some members of Congress had good things to say about the court decision and they pledged to oppose new internet indecency laws.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't need and cannot afford renewed efforts to evade the court's decision and censor speech on the Internet,&quot; said Rep Jerrold Nadler, Democrat from New York. &quot;I hope that Congress and the president will read the court's decision and learn from it.&quot;</p>
<p>Sen. Joseph Biden, a Delaware Democrat, said he would back an alternative legislative approach requiring the government to help develop technological filtering solutions.</p>
<p>Some software is already available that attempts to filter or screen materials from the Internet to prevent children from accessing pornography, Biden said.</p>
<p>&quot;The market is already developing software and hardware to enable parents to block children's access to filth, violence and other objectionable material,&quot; he said. &quot;This solution is now proven as the better way.&quot;</p>
<p>Makers of one of the most popular filtering programs, called Surfwatch, said Thursday they would provide users with daily updates of sites inappropriate for children.</p>
<p>The program &quot;is a far more viable and less restrictive solution than government censorship,&quot; Surfwatch general manager Michael Sears said.</p>
