<p>United Airlines said it reached tentative labour agreements with unions representing its pilots and machinists.</p>
<p>The carrier, the operating subsidiary of UAL Corp, said the agreements with the Air Line Pilots Association and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers included two mid-term wage increases of 5 percent for both groups of employee owners. The first would become effective in July, while the second would be in effect in July of 1998.</p>
<p>The company said in the year 2000, the agreements also restore wage rates for the two groups to levels that existed before July of 1994, when the pilots, machinists, salaried and management employees agreed to wage reductions in exchange for stock in UAL through an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP).</p>
<p>&quot;By committing to restoring pre-ESOP wages, it ensures that employees, who have already sacrificed their wages to help keep United flying will not be asked to do so twice,&quot; Mike Glawe, chairman of the pilots union's Master Exectuive Council at United said in a statement.</p>
<p>The carrier also said its contribution to the pilots' pension fund will also be restored to pre-ESOP levels of 9 percent from its current level of 1 percent.</p>
<p>Last month, United's 8,500 union pilots rejected a wage proposal that would have increased pay by 10 percent over four years. The machinists' union, which represents more than 12,000 United employee-owners, also rejected a similar proposal in early January.</p>
<p>Pilots' union officials said the new pact represented a critical moment in the development of the company as en employee-owned business.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officials of the machinists' union said they anticipated prompt and overwhelming support for the agreement by the rank and file.</p>
<p>&quot;It's been a long, and at times, somewhat rocky road that's gotten us to this point, but employee ownership means workers must be able to express their views freely and to have those views respected, and to share in the financial success of their company,&quot; Ken Thiede, president of the machinists' union District 141 said in a statement.</p>
<p>&quot;I believe this agreement puts us closer to that goal than ever before, and I am optimistic about the future of United Airlines and its employee ownwers,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The agreement with the machinists also provides for a one-time, lump-sum payment for employees represented by that union and payment of premiums for various skills and licenses.</p>
