<p>County Hall is a grand white building whose palatial facade faces the Houses of Parliament across the river Thames. It was built in the 1940s to house London's governing council.</p>
<p>Following 18 years of Conservative rule in parliament, the building is now owned by a Japanese company and being converted into luxury flats. London, Europe's largest city, is the only western capital without its own government.</p>
<p>The Greater London Council (GLC) was abolished by &quot;Iron Lady&quot; Margaret Thatcher in 1986 in one of her many triumphs over the political left.</p>
<p>The GLC was led in the 1980s by &quot;Red Ken&quot; Livingstone, one of Thatcher's hate figures who taunted her across the river by flying a giant red banner on the front of County Hall tracking the then rising number of London's jobless.</p>
<p>More than a decade later, the opposition Labour Party says that if it wins the May 1 national election, it will reinstate a ruling body for London and create the post of elected mayor for the capital.</p>
<p>LONDON'S FUTURE DIVIDES MAIN PARTIES</p>
<p>The future of London is one of the few election issues on which the two main parties are utterly divided.</p>
<p>The Conservatives, now led by John Major, insist the system created in 1986, when the GLC's responsibilities were carved up between more than 80 different bodies, most of them unelected, is working.</p>
<p>Conservative leaders argue that any London-wide government would be profligate and unwieldy.</p>
<p>They summon up memories of the gargantuan GLC with its staff of more than 20,000 and annual budget of two billion pounds ($3.3 billion). Prime Minister Major can still raise a chill of horror among Conservative supporters by reminding them of the antics of the left-led GLC.</p>
<p>Under Livingstone, now a Labour member of parliament, the GLC declared London a nuclear-free zone, twinned it with Nicaragua and handed out grants to a swathe of minority groups, including lesbians and single parents.</p>
<p>In fact, economists have never established whether abolishing the GLC achieved Thatcher's stated aim of cutting costs and bureaucracy because its functions are now so disparate.</p>
<p>The Conservative's 40-page manifesto for London offers only one major new policy -- the privatisation of the underground railway -- and devotes several pages to warning of the dangers of Labour's plans.</p>
<p>&quot;London is booming precisely because it isn't stifled by too much government and 'strategic' bureacracy; because, free from the threat of an all-powerful city-wide authority, people are prepared to work together, to co-operate,&quot; said Environment Secretary John Gummer, unveiling the manifesto this month.</p>
<p>CAPITAL APPEARS TO BE THRIVING</p>
<p>London does appear to be thriving. The U.S. magazine Newsweek has labelled it the coolest place on the planet and the city is experiencing a third year of economic growth after a recession in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Tourism hit a record high last year, with nearly 24 million visitors to Britain, nearly all of whom visited London.</p>
<p>But Labour says Londoners have suffered unfairly under Conservative rule. Unemployment rates are at national highs in parts of London and thousands of the city's householders are in huge debt because their houses are worth less than they paid for them during the property boom of the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Opinion polls suggest Labour will take control of Britain and London in the May 1 general election, leaving Major's Conservatives with just eight parliamentary seats of the capital's 74.</p>
<p>Labour has not fleshed out its overall policy for London but the party's leader Tony Blair has won strong support for his proposal for a mayor and a &quot;strategic&quot; Greater London Authority (GLA).</p>
<p>&quot;The baby of efficiency went out 10 years ago with the bathwater of political correctness, Tory (Conservative) style, when the GLC was scrapped instead of being usefully scaled down and reformed,&quot; wrote Anne McElvoy, deputy editor of the Spectator magazine.</p>
<p>&quot;The result is that our identity as Londoners - whether we were born within the sound of Bow Bells or imported from the far steppes of the provinces - is fragmented and so is our city.&quot;</p>
<p>Last year, thousands of Londoners crowded a London hall for a series of meetings to discuss the future of their city.</p>
<p>&quot;These debates, which the organisers had modestly expected might fill a church hall in Piccadilly, have become surely the biggest indoor rallies in post-war London politics,&quot; wrote Simon Jenkins, whose London Evening Standard newspaper helped sponsor the event.</p>
<p>If Blair is elected and his party fulfils its pledges on London, the Greater London Authority will have to find a different home from its predecessor.</p>
<p>The luxury flats in County Hall are almost complete and Demi Moore and Bruce Willis are reported to be among prospective tenants.</p>
