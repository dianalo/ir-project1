<p>A dual auction of gilts this week, worth 3.5 billion stg, should prove easily digestible for the market despite fears about inflation pressures and rising interest rates, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Bank of England will auction 2.0 billion stg of 7.0 percent gilts due 2001 on Tuesday and 1.5 billion stg of 8.0 percent stock due 2015 on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;Auctions have had a good record ever since March or April, particularly the shorter ones,&quot; said Steve Scott, gilts analyst at Kleinwort Benson.</p>
<p>&quot;The higher yields and spreads now available in the market may encourage buying,&quot; Scott said.</p>
<p>The 10-year gilt/Bund spread has ballooned by nearly 20 basis points in recent sessions as strong economic data showed the British consumer is back with a vengeance and underlying inflation ticked up to 2.9 percent year-on-year.</p>
<p>The extent of the gilt market's nerves was demonstrated on Friday when Tim Congdon, a member of the Treasury's panel of independent economic advisers, called for a full percentage point rate rise in a newspaper article.</p>
<p>Gilts dropped sharply even though Congdon is well known to be a monetary hawk. But those jitters should not deter investors from coming to auction, analysts said.</p>
<p>Scott said both auctions would get ample cover and only moderate yield tails. &quot;Tails aren't really a problem because they indicate some depth to the market. But they won't be too long this time anyway. There will be no scrabbling to sell.&quot;</p>
<p>Don Smith, UK economist at HSBC Markets, said the success of the inaugural dual auction set a positive backdrop.</p>
<p>The Bank launched a ground-breaking dual auction in July. Then, the shorter stock on offer proved a roaring success as two billion stg of 8.0 percent gilts due 2000 were covered 4.81 times with no yield tail.</p>
<p>The second part of the sale, 1.5 billion stg of the same longer dated stock that is on offer this week, was also well received, attracting cover of 1.88 times.</p>
<p>Smith said the five-year paper on offer this week looks good value. He noted the five-year gilt/Bund spread has widened by over 40 basis points in the last two months while the 10-year spread has swelled by just 11 ticks.</p>
<p>Analysts at Goldman Sachs agreed. &quot;Futures have outperformed recently and dragged that (10-year) area of the curve higher,&quot; they said in a client note.</p>
<p>Furthermore, five- and 20-year gilts have been shunned by investors ahead of this week's auctions.</p>
<p>For that reason, they forecast the second part of this week's auction, the sale of gilts due 2015, would also go well.</p>
<p>&quot;After this auction there is no further supply at the long end of the market until February,&quot; the Goldman analysts said. &quot;This could produce a severe shortage of long dated stock&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally, although the gilt market is now hyper-sensitive to signs of burgeoning inflation, this week's data could provide some relief. The Confederation of British Industry's quarterly industrial trends survey, due on Tuesday, is expected to show moderating improvement and the consensus forecast for September retail sales figures on Wednesday is for sales to fall 0.1 percent on the month.</p>
<p>&quot;We expect the market generally to be well supported this week,&quot; Smith said. &quot;In particular, we forecast a much weaker sales number than the market expects.&quot; HSBC have pencilled in a 0.8 percent fall in sales.-- London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109</p>
