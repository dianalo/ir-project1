<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) warned on Friday that some 75 million people, twice the current figure, could be blind by the year 2020 unless there was a global effort to halt the trend.</p>
<p>In a report issued after week-long discussions in Geneva by experts from around the world, the United Nations agency said developing countries would be hardest hit but industrialised economies were also suffering.</p>
<p>Within the next quarter of a century, the WHO said, &quot;blindness and serious visual disability, already a public health problem -- will become a major socio-economic burden worldwide....&quot;</p>
<p>The development &quot;may even thwart progress in some middle and low-income countries,&quot; the report declared.</p>
<p>The WHO said that at present close to 150 million people around the globe suffered from significant visual disability, of whom 38 million were blind.</p>
<p>More than two-thirds of these cases could be avoided &quot;through adequate and timely intervention and treatment,&quot; it added.</p>
<p>Of about seven million people who now lose their sight every year, 70 per cent had vision restored through treatment -- leaving the overall number of blind increasing by up to two million annually.</p>
<p>Some 80 per cent of these new cases were related to ageing. Based on demographic trends, the experts estimated that by 2020 there would be around 54 million blind people around the world aged over 60, 50 million in developing countries.</p>
<p>In other age groups, the total number in 25 years time would be over 21 million, the WHO said.</p>
<p>The report said that by 2020 the burden of disabling eye diseases on national economies would also surge.</p>
<p>&quot;The costs for eye care and surgery are expected to escalate because of increased demand and as a result of the introduction of new technologies,&quot; it declared.</p>
<p>&quot;To curb this trend, a new global initiative is needed, bringing together international organisdations, governments, non-governmental development organisations and industry in a WHO-coordinated international effort to eliminate avoidable blindness and visual disability,&quot; the WHO said.</p>
