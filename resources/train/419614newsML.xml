<p>Thai Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan on Tuesday called on private banks and finance firms with surplus funds to help the authorities ease liquidity problems of other financial institutions.</p>
<p>Amnuay, asked how the government would help out finance companies struggling to raise capital and set aside higher provisions for deteriorating assets, said: &quot;The central bank is prepared to help but (private) financial institutions should cooperate by opening credit lines among themselves.&quot;  </p>
<p>Amnuay said the central bank will closely monitor the situation and provide necessary assistance.</p>
<p>Central bank governor Rerngchai Marakanond on Monday instructed banks and finance firms to raise provisions for sub- standard debt, a measure that will require them to set aside a total 50 billion baht ($1.94 billion) of reserves within two years.</p>
<p>He also said 10 finance firms, including three listed companies, would also have to increase capital by 8.25 billion baht immediately to assure creditors that they could continue operating soundly.</p>
<p>A central bank source said on Tuesday the bank would aval, or guarantee, promissory notes issued by finance companies that face public runs on their deposits to ensure that these firms can meet withdrawals by jittery clients.</p>
<p>The source said the 10 finance firms told to raise capital faced runs on their deposits for the second day on Tuesday but withdrawal demand is expected to ease later.</p>
<p>Amnuay said recent measures adopted by the central bank were aimed at boosting domestic liquidity, resulting in a gradual decline in Thai interbank rates which eased to appropriate levels this week.</p>
<p>The Thai overnight interbank rate eased to 8.50-9.00 percent on Tuesday morning from 8.75-9.50 late on Monday.</p>
