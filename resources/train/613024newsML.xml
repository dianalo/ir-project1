<p>French voters sent President Jacques Chirac a message of angry protest on Sunday, putting the opposition left well ahead of his centre-right coalition in the first round of a parliamentary election.</p>
<p>The vote of disenchantment with two years of austerity and rising unemployment under Prime Minister Alain Juppe threw the outcome of next Sunday's decisive second-round runoff wide open, polling institutes said.</p>
<p>Projections broadcast after voting ended at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT) suggested France could be heading for a period of difficult &quot;cohabitation&quot; between a possible left-wing government and the conservative Chirac, who called the snap election in hopes of securing a majority for his remaining five years in office.</p>
<p>The opposition Socialists, Communists, extreme-left and other-left candidates were set to capture between 40.6 and 41.6 percent of the vote, with the ruling RPR-UDF coalition and other moderate-right candidates scoring between 36.1 and 37.1 percent.</p>
<p>The extreme-right National Front was on course for its best ever parliamentary score with about 15 percent and its leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, called on Chirac to resign.</p>
<p>Juppe, whose deep unpopularity was a key factor, sought to put a brave face on his side's mediocre result.</p>
<p>In a brief statement at coalition headquarters, he said: &quot;The French people meant above all to say that they want a real change. We must listen to this message.&quot;</p>
<p>Pledging a renewed drive to modernise France for the 21st century, the prime minister urged the right to mobilise all its efforts to win the second round.</p>
<p>Socialist party leader Lionel Jospin said the first- round results showed a new, left-wing majority was possible and appealed to the left to unite for victory next Sunday.</p>
<p>&quot;I call on all those who want a more balanced government and a new policy for France to unite on this (June 1) second round. All those who aspire to change must unite because a change of majority is possible and desirable,&quot; Jospin said in a statement in his constituency of Cintegabelle, near Toulouse.</p>
<p>Communist leader Robert Hue said Chirac had sought a vote of confidence and the French people had told him &quot;No!&quot;.</p>
<p>Gaullist Justice Minister Jacques Toubon, whose own seat in Paris was reported to be at risk, said the vote was &quot;a warning, a manifestation of disappointment, discontent and irritation&quot;.</p>
<p>Most of the 577 National Assembly seats were expected to go to a runoff, where the behaviour of National Front supporters and of the roughly 32 percent of voters who abstained on the first round will be crucial.</p>
<p>The SOFRES polling firm forecast that the RPR-UDF coalition would win 255-287 seats next Sunday, short of the 289 required for a parliamentary majority. It projected the Socialists would win 250-270 seats, their Communist allies 21-30 seats and the National Front 0-3 seats.</p>
<p>The BVA institute put the RPR-UDF between 255 and 275, well short of a majority, with the Socialists taking 250 to 270, the Communists 15-20 and the National Front 0-2.</p>
<p>Both projections might leave the Communists holding the balance of power or even give a tiny handful of extreme-right deputies a pivotal position.</p>
<p>The forecasts sent the mark higher against several European currencies in rare currency trading on a Sunday night, traders said. Economists forecast a nervous reaction to the left's stronger-than-expected showing when French financial markets open on Monday.</p>
<p>The projected vote was a severe blow to Chirac, who wagered the future of his presidency after two years in office on the snap election, 10 months before his vast parliamentary majority needed to face voters.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a very bad score for the RPR-UDF. I think one can say that the president has lost his gamble,&quot; anti-Maastricht left-winger Jean-Pierre Chevenement crowed on television.</p>
<p>Chirac said he took the decision because he needed a &quot;new elan&quot; to lead France into a single European currency, a policy rejected by both the Communists and the National Front.</p>
<p>Voters had a choice between a centre-right platform promising market-oriented reforms to scale down state control, and an opposition pledging vigorous state job creation and a shorter working week to attack record 12.8 percent joblessness.</p>
<p>A total 6,389 candidates, including a record 1,469 women, vied on Sunday for seats in the chamber.</p>
<p>Juppe, shown by opinion polls last year to be the least popular prime minister since 1958, had to submit to an unexpected identity check when he voted in the southwestern city of Bordeaux where he is a candidate.</p>
<p>When a polling official asked him to identify himself, Juppe replied: &quot;Usually, it's enough to be well known&quot;. The official refused to budge, obliging Juppe to show his identity card.</p>
<p>Chirac himself voted in Sarran, a village in his home bastion of Correze in central France.</p>
