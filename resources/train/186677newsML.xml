<p>France's conservative government on Wednesday approved a revised 1996 budget meant to hold course on deficit reduction despite weak economic growth.</p>
<p>The traditional end-of-year budget covers new spending requirements -- including recapitalisations of state firms -- while capping the budget deficit to ensure France meets targets it set itself in preparation for European monetary union.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Alain Lamassoure told reporters the revised budget fixed the central government budget deficit at 287.9 billion french francs ($56.58 billion), just 100 million more than the 287.8 billion francs forecast in the initial 1996 Finance Act.</p>
<p>This would allow France to meet its target of limiting the total deficit -- which also includes welfare and local authority spending -- to four percent of gross domestic product this year.</p>
<p>It plans to cut the deficit to three percent of GDP in 1997 to meet Maastricht treaty standards from five percent last year.</p>
<p>&quot;They look to be right on track,&quot; ABN Amro economist Philippe Brossard said. &quot;Their four percent target looks quite all right,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>The budget allows for a total of 40 billion francs in what Lamassoure said were &quot;inevitable&quot; increases in spending.</p>
<p>This will be offset by spending cuts elsewhere of 35 billion francs, and six billion francs in higher-than-expected revenues.</p>
<p>Lamassoure said that while weak economic growth had bitten into revenues from Value Added Tax (sales tax), company and income taxes had risen, while the government had also brought in 17 billion francs in non-tax receipts.</p>
<p>He declined to give full details on non-tax receipts, although some seven billion will come from state bank Caisse des Depots et Consignations and export credit agency Coface.</p>
<p>Further windfall gains came from a lower than expected contribution to the European Union budget, and lower debt service charges, thanks to the fall in interest rates.</p>
<p>Lamassoure said the revised budget also provided 4.9 billion francs in central government funds to help pay for capital injections to state-owned companies this year.</p>
<p>Since taking office in 1995, the government has used money from privatisations to pay for capital injections. But heavy state sector demand for recapitalisations has forced the government to top up these revenues with central budget funds.</p>
<p>Lamassoure said the government's sale of a nine percent stake in oil company Elf on Wednesday brought revenues from privatisations this year to 27 billion francs.</p>
<p>The government said earlier it expected to make 10 billion francs from selling most of the remaining stake it retained after Elf's 1994 privatisation.</p>
<p>Combined with a total 8.7 billion francs in central government funds, the government thus had a total 36 billion francs to spend on recapitalisations this year.</p>
<p>Lamassoure said 13 billion francs had already been spent on injections into Air France, arms maker GIAT, regional bank Societe Marseillaise de Credit and Cie Generale Maritime.</p>
<p>&quot;That leaves 23 billion francs which will therefore be shared out between now and the end of the year between companies which need to be recapitalised, particularly those that are in the course of being privatised,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He declined to name the companies involved.</p>
<p>But state-owned Thomson SA is due to have an 11 billion franc recapitalisation before it is sold to Lagardere Groupe, while the government may need to spend up to 2.6 billion francs to pay for a managed wind-down of property lender Credit Foncier de France.</p>
<p>State bank Credit Lyonnais may need a more than 10 billion franc capital injection in the years ahead to ready it for privatisation, banking analysts estimate.</p>
