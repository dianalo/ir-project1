<p>U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Monday the current U.S. tax system is unfair, and the Internal Revenue Service must be eliminated for a simpler system that lowers the tax burden on families.</p>
<p>&quot;Our goal is the total dismantling of today's tax system,&quot; Lott said during a luncheon speech to the Economic Club of Chicago about replacing the U.S. tax system by 2001</p>
<p>Lott said the U.S. must replace the current tax system &quot;with a new system that is fair, simple, uniform and most important, a system that lowers the tax burden on working men and women.&quot;</p>
<p>Lott wants to replace the IRS with a Taxpayer Protection Agency and reduce income tax &quot;to the point where no family pays more than 25 percent,&quot; including state and local taxes.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm not sure exactly what is the best system yet,&quot; Lott said. &quot;I had been leaning toward a single flat rate tax.&quot;</p>
<p>However, Lott said a sales tax or consumption tax, as espoused by Representative Bill Archer, a Texas Republican and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, had merit.</p>
<p>&quot;We need to talk about it,&quot; he said, adding that any sales tax would have to be accompanied by a repeal of the income tax.</p>
<p>Lott, a Republican from Mississippi, helped craft Friday's balanced-budget deal between the White House and congressional Republicans that will provide for a gross $135 billion in tax cuts over five years, including capital gains tax relief.</p>
<p>After the speech, Lott told reporters he would like to see the capital gains tax rate below 20 percent. The Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee will decide on the capital gains tax rate.</p>
