<p>The stock of online book retailer Amazon.com Inc. surged more than 60 percent on its first day of trading Thursday, extending a rally that began even before the company went public.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday, Amazon.com launched an initial public offering of 3 million shares at $18 a share. Just two days earlier, lead underwriter Deutsche Morgan Grenfell had already raised the price to between $14 and $16 a share from $12 to $14 a share, reflecting healthy demand for the Internet book seller.</p>
<p>The stock traded Thursday at $26.75 on Nasdaq, where it was the most active issue on volume of almost 3 million shares in late morning trading.</p>
<p>Amazon's offering, one of the most closely watched IPOs this year, has attracted considerable attention because the Seattle-based company has been one of only a handful of companies to successfully exploit the Internet as a vehicle for commerce.</p>
<p>IPO analysts had expected the two-year old company to garner strong premiums, especially since technology stocks have rebounded this month after slumping earlier in the year.</p>
<p>The company offers more than 2.5 million titles and bills itself as the world's biggest bookstore.</p>
<p>On Monday, bookstore giant Barnes &amp; Noble took issue with that description and filed a lawsuit against Amazon.com.</p>
<p>Barnes &amp; Noble also launched its own Web site on Tuesday, boasting more than 1 million available books, most of which were being offered at prices that undercut Amazon's.</p>
<p>Amazon is growing exponentially, selling $15.7 million worth of books in 1996. It topped that in the first quarter this year, selling $16 million from its headquarters in a slightly run-down Seattle office building.</p>
<p>But it warned in its prosectus that such growth rates are probably &quot;not sustainable&quot; and said it expects to incur &quot;substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future.&quot;</p>
<p>Investors are betting that with a cash infusion of some $40 million, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, 33, will be able to capitalise on the buzz that has made his company one of the best-known names in Internet commerce.</p>
<p>But Amazon.com could have a tough time beating back Barnes &amp; Noble and other rivals. Other booksellers also are dipping into online waters, and Borders Group Inc. is expected to announce its Internet plans soon.</p>
<p>Amazon said it has granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to 450,000 additional shares from the company to covering over-allotments, if any. Alex. Brown Inc. and Hambrecht &amp; Quist are co-managers in the IPO.</p>
