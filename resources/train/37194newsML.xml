<p>Peruvian Prime Minister Alberto Pandolfi predicted annual exports would rise 127 percent to $13.55 billion by 2005 from an estimated $5.96 billion this year.</p>
<p>At a Congressional hearing late Thursday, Pandolfi also predicted exports would rise to $6.730 billion by 1998.  </p>
<p>Exports in 1995 were $5.572 billion, while imports last year were $7.687 billion.</p>
<p>Pandolfi also said that the current account deficit would be less than five percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 1998 and around three percent in the years after 2000.  </p>
<p>The current account deficit in the first quarter of 1996 was six percent of GDP, down from 7.2 percent last year, Pandolfi had previously said.</p>
<p>The prime minister reiterated the government's forecast of three percent economic growth in 1996, rising to six percent in 1998.</p>
<p>He added that central government's operating income would rise from 14.1 percent of GDP in 1996 to 14.6 percent in 1998 and 16 percent in the first years of the next decade.</p>
