<p>The rest of the world was long addicted to television by the time the first South African broadcaster was set up in 1976, but now the country's television addicts are catching up fast -- via satellite.</p>
<p>Over the next six months two new networks, promising a total of 13 channels, plan to start beaming to South African homes.</p>
<p>Industry figures say the market is buoyant.</p>
<p>&quot;We are very optimistic about the market. It's growing well,&quot; said Hans Hawinkels, chief executive of MultiChoice.</p>
<p>MultiChoice, which offers a &quot;bouquet&quot; of up to 24 channels, is soon to be challenged by AstraSat, the satellite arm of state-owned South African Broadcasting Corp (SABC) and Uplink Broadcasting Ltd, a Christianity-oriented network.</p>
<p>Both newcomers are hunting for equity partners to raise funding.</p>
<p>AstraSat is offering local firms a 40 percent slice of its equity and overseas investors another 20 percent. The firm is hungry for cash injections because, as SABC is a public broadcaster, it wants to minimise the financial risk.</p>
<p>Chief executive Gert Claassen said the firm expected to announce its partners later this month. &quot;We are getting on with the discussions very well,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The six-channel service is set to launch early next year.</p>
<p>Funding Uplink is a different proposition. The group wants to spend 350 million rand ($77 million) on launching seven channels &quot;free of gratuitous violence, foul language and sex scenes&quot;.</p>
<p>About 35 percent of the cash is to be raised by a private share placing for Christian individual investors and firms. The rest is to come from more conventional equity partners.</p>
<p>Chief executive Craig Kinsman said the firm was seeking to encourage groups it has already struck strategic alliances with, such as BSkyB, to take a stake.</p>
<p>&quot;We are working very hard to get them on board,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Multi-Choice, as the dominant giant, is sceptical about whether either new network will get off the ground. &quot;I think they will have trouble getting funding,&quot; Hawinkels said.</p>
<p>Both Uplink and AstraSat have faced the dilemma of plumping for digital broadcasting, which is expensive but can broadcast many channels and is seen as the technology of the future, or using the older analogue system.</p>
<p>They have taken different choices.</p>
<p>AstraSat, with an eye on costs, is to use analogue and hopes that the cheaper rates it will then offer will help it reach its aims of 125,000 subscribers a year after launch and 600,000 in five years' time.</p>
<p>&quot;Analogue is not just a technological issue, it is a price issue,&quot; said Claassen.</p>
<p>AstraSat believes that a rising black middle class will be attracted to a more affordable analogue network. &quot;There is a huge upwardly mobile sector of the population coming through. Why should they just have to go for top-end of the market?&quot; Claassen said.</p>
<p>MultiChoice, which already offers the cheaper analogue channel M-Net and has a total of about a million subscribers, is prepared for a cut-throat price war with AstraSat. &quot;I will meet the price. I would have to kill them off,&quot; Hawinkels said.</p>
<p>Hawinkels said choosing analogue technology offered only a short-term price advantage. &quot;Why would anyone want to invest in that? It is like reinventing the wheel,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Uplink, however, has joined MultiChoice in seeking to offer a digital service. The group has struck a technical deal with digital supplier Scientific Atlanta which it says will cut the cost of setting up the network.</p>
<p>&quot;Costs will almost be comparable to analogue,&quot; Kinsman said.</p>
<p>No matter which technology beams the programmes back to Earth both new networks are foregoing the challenge of meeting Multi-Choice head on and instead aim to carve out niche markets.</p>
<p>Kinsman thinks Uplink can exploit a need for targetted local viewing, as compared to Multi-Choice's range of international channels like Cartoon Network and music-based VH-1.</p>
<p>&quot;We are trying to really specialise in niches...we are not competing head-to-head (with Multi-choice). Our systems will exist side-by-side,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Uplink's &quot;family-values&quot; viewing may strike a chord in a nation beset by violent crime and, two years after its first full democratic elections, still dogged by racial tension.</p>
<p>Uplink has calculated that its programming could appeal to 1.3 million subscribers and aims to have signed up 350,000 of them over the next five years.</p>
<p>If the two new channels are successful the market may soon start to look a little crowded. The PAS-7 satellite is set for launch by the end of next year and will pave the way for even more entries into the market.</p>
