<p>A teenage boy charged with murdering a 16-year-old girl went to the same high school and was a casual acquaintance of the victim, officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The body of Nielsa Mason was found in the shower area of a boys' locker room at Cumberland Regional High School Monday night. She had been beaten and had cuts around the neck, police said.</p>
<p>It was the second highly publicised killing involving teenagers in New Jersey in the past 10 days. On April 19 two teenagers allegedly lured two young pizza deliverymen to an abandoned house in rural Franklin and shot them to death.</p>
<p>Cumberland County prosecutor Arthur Marchand said Wednesday he would seek to try the 16-year-old boy accused in Monday's murder as an adult so he could face a tougher punishment if convicted. The teen was arrested Tuesday night and charged with beating his classmate to death.</p>
<p>The name of the arrested teen was not released.</p>
<p>Officials said the teens were both from Bridgeton, New Jersey, and sophomores at the high school.</p>
<p>Mason was &quot;literally beaten to death,&quot; New Jersey State Police spokesman John Hagerty said. He said the motive for the crime was still under investigation.</p>
<p>Her body was found fully clothed in the locker room by a school custodian after her father reported her missing. Her father found her bookbag but could not find her when he went to the school to pick her up after track practice.</p>
