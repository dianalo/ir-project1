<title>HONG KONG: Shenzhen A, B shares rally on technical rebound.</title>
<headline>Shenzhen A, B shares rally on technical rebound.</headline>
<dateline>HONG KONG 1996-09-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shenzhen's A and B share indices staged a technical rebound on Thursday following Wednesday's slide, analysts said.</p>
<p>But a growing number of investors, cautious about buying after recent falls, moved to the sidelines to wait for major market-moving news, they said. The lower turnover in the A and B share markets reflected the trend, they added.</p>
<p>The B share index inched up 0.20 point, or 0.23 percent, to close at 87.73, on turnover of HK$13.54 million, compared with HK$15.60 million on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The A share index rose 4.64 points, or 1.80 percent, to 262.70, with turnover shrinking to 3.79 billion yuan from 5.41 billion yuan. The composite index jumped 4.14 points, or 1.70 percent, to end at 248.56.</p>
<p>One analyst said that, technically speaking, the B share market had bottomed out because the B index had consolidated below the 90-point level in a narrow range for about 20 sessions.</p>
<p>On the B share market, Shenzhen International Enterprise, which specialises in retailing and real estate development, rose HK$0.13, or 5.33 percent, to HK$2.57.  </p>
<p>Shenzhen Properties climbed HK$0.07, or 3.00 percent, to HK$2.40. Brokers said that the issue had fallen steeply since it released sharply lower interim earnings this year.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Textile gained HK$0.05 to HK$1.74 and SEG added HK$0.06 to HK$2.69.</p>
<p>Guangdong Expressway, which operates the highway linking Shenzhen and Guangzhou, inched up HK$0.01 to HK$4.61 on thin volume of 9,800 shares. A trader said the firm has a promising earnings outlook because traffic on the highway will increase after Hong Kong returns to China next year.  </p>
<p>Diesel engine maker Changchai lost early gains on late profit-taking, brokers said. The issue fell HK$0.01 to HK$5.06 on the session's heaviest turnover of 985,600 shares.</p>
<p>Tellus Machinery showed the largest fall among B shares, down HK$0.04, or 2.47 percent, to HK$1.58.</p>
<p>On the A share market, cement producer Guangxi Huwei Co Ltd, which listed 15.50 million class A shares and 4.50 million staff shares in Shenzhen on Thursday, ended the session up at 8.66 yuan each on active trade of 16.82 million shares.</p>
<p>Gold mining concern Inner Mongolia Hongfeng surged 1.95 yuan, or 30.47 percent, to 8.35 yuan on speculative buying.</p>
