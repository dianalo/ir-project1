<p>Veteran centre Adam Oates reported to his new team on Tuesday after negotiating a new contract to play for the Washington Capitals.</p>
<p>Oates, who was part of a big six-player trade between the Boston Bruins and Washington on Saturday, had refused to report to the Capitals without a renegotiated contract.</p>
<p>&quot;This is truly an exciting day in the history of the Washington Capitals franchise,&quot; team chairman Abe Pollin said at a Tuesday news conference to announce that Oates was on board.</p>
<p>&quot;We have secured a lineup that features all-stars Peter Bondra, Adam Oates, Phil Housley, Dale Hunter and Bill Ranford. This roster makes us an immediate contender for the 1997 Stanley Cup playoffs,&quot; Pollin said.</p>
<p>The star centre was traded by Boston, along with goaltender Ranford and right wing Rick Tocchet in exchange for goalie Jim Carey, centres Anson Carter and Jason Allison and a 1997 third-round draft pick.</p>
<p>But Oates sat out the Capitals 2-0 home loss to the last-place New York Islanders Sunday before holding contract talks with the team Monday. Terms of the new deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The 34-year-old Oates is one of the NHL's premier centres and is currently fourth in the league with 52 assists.</p>
<p>The 12-year veteran, who played for Detroit and St Louis before being traded to Boston during the 1991-92 campaign, has 730 career assists and 254 goals.</p>
<p>Oates has 18 goals and 70 points in 63 games this season, and led Boston in scoring in each of his five seasons there.</p>
<p>But the disgruntled centre had been subject of trade rumours after publicly blasting Bruins officials for the team's lack of direction. He was then stripped of his assistant capatain's role, which intensified the trade speculation.</p>
<p>The Capitals have been struggling offensively all season and are currently two points out of the final Eastern Conference playoff spot with 55 points.</p>
