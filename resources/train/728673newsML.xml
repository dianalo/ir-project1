<p>Major Czech steel mills and coal mines have been forced to cut output and may have to close soon due to the interruption of rail links caused by the worst floods this century, the daily Hospodarske Noviny reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The paper said 900 railway carriages full of steel have piled up at the Nova Hut a.s. steel mill, in the north-eastern region of Ostrava where only eight trains are running.</p>
<p>Shipments of steel and coal to neighbouring Poland and Slovakia remained interrupted, the paper said,</p>
<p>As a result, Nova Hut, steelworks Vitkovice a.s. and Trinecke Zelezarny a.s. and coal mine OKD a.s. may be forced to shut down in a week's time.</p>
<p>&quot;If we don't get more empty carriages, we will be forced to stop the machinery, and that will cause a chain reaction in other firms,&quot; the newspaper quoted Karel Hybl of Nova Hut as saying.</p>
<p>It quoted Oldrich Faiman, the director of OKD's transportation division, saying his customers were stopping production. He said the most endangered were Slovak steel mill VSZ Kosice and Voest-Alpine Stahl Linz GmbH.</p>
<p>Company officials were not immediately available for additional comment.</p>
<p>Hospodarske said Trinecke, running at one-third capacity, was also suffering from a lack of lime and scrap metal.</p>
<p>For over a week, the eastern part of the Czech Republic has suffered the worst flooding this century caused damage estimated at as much as 100 billion crowns, killing at least 39 people.</p>
<p>The flood interrupted rail and road connections in the affected regions as well as gas, power and telephone links.</p>
<p>The Czech parliament has approved the issue of up to five billion crowns in flood bonds and the release of up to another five billion from privatisation proceeds.</p>
