<p>Belgian-French company Mobistar, which operates Belgium's second GSM mobile phone network, said on Monday it had signed up 68,000 clients four months after its launch -- 42,000 more than expected.</p>
<p>&quot;This number strongly exceeds our initial forecast of 26,000,&quot; the company said in a statement. &quot;Mobistar has now reached a sales rhythm initially expected for mid-1997,&quot; it said.</p>
<p>The statement quoted Mobistar Managing Director Bernard Ghillebaert as saying he was &quot;very satisfied with the extremely fast start of Mobistar and with its operational results&quot;.</p>
<p>The statement said a survey carried out in late November and early December showed that 94 percent of Mobistar's clients were willing to recommend the service to friends and relatives.</p>
<p>Mobistar is owned 62 percent by France Telecom. Belgian data communications firm Telinfo NV has 10 percent and a group of eight other Belgian investors 28 percent.</p>
<p>Belgacom Mobile, which operates Belgium's first mobile phone service Proximus, had 409,000 GSM subscriptions by December 31.</p>
<p>Belgacom Mobile is 75-percent owned by Belgian state telephone operator Belgacom and 25-percent by AirTouch Communications Inc.</p>
<p>Belgacom Mobile spokesman Luc De Groote said he expected there to be 800,000 mobile phone users by the end of this year -- eight percent of the entire population.</p>
<p>De Groote told Reuters he expected two million mobile phone users by the year 2000 -- &quot;as many as possible&quot; of those from Belgacom Mobile. Mobistar has said it hopes to have 11 percent of the Belgian market by 2000.</p>
<p>Belgacom is 49.9 percent owned by a consortium including Ameritech, Singapore Telecom, Tele Danmark and three Belgian groups.</p>
