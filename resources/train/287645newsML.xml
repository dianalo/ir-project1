<headline>No breakthrough in Irish prison siege.</headline>

<p>Negotiations in Dublin's Mountjoy jail on Sunday failed to secure the release of four prison officers held hostage by six inmates armed with makeshift weapons.</p>
<p>The officers, seized on Saturday night, were being held in the prison's segregation unit and were reported to be unharmed.</p>
<p>The prison governor and a senior official from the Irish Justice Department were continuing talks to win their release.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Nora Owen said the six prisoners were protesting against alleged ill-treatment and overcrowding.</p>
<p>The inmates and the officers were well and food was being taken to them during the negotiations, she added.</p>
<p>A representative of the Irish Penal Reform Trust appealed to the prisoners to end their siege.</p>
<p>&quot;I would plead with them to think and consider how they could end it. I think it is quite important that the officers have been humanely treated so in a real sense no real harm has been done,&quot; said Valerie Bresnihan.</p>
<p>The six inmates, who were described as armed with iron bars and blood-filled syringes, originally took five prison officers hostage on Saturday night but they released one man shortly after the siege began.</p>
<p>The officer was sent to the prison governor to ask Justice Department officials to intervene in the crisis at the Victorian prison outside Dublin which has a history of problems including drug taking. Some of the prisoners in the jail are HIV positive.</p>
<p>Paul Ward, one of the inmates involved in the siege, and who is facing conspiracy-to-murder charges in connection with the fatal shooting of Irish investigative journalist Veronica Guerin, was also protesting his innocence.</p>
<p>Guerin was gunned down in her car in Dublin last June.</p>
<p>No political prisoners or members of the Irish Republican Army which has fought a 25-year war to oust Britain from Northern Ireland are held at the prison.</p>
