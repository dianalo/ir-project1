<title>JAPAN: U.S. Treasuries not excessively vulnerable - Lindsey.</title>

<p>Former Federal Reserve Board Governor Lawrence Lindsey told Reuters Financial Television in an interview on Friday that he did not think the U.S. Treasury market was extra vulnerable to a sell-off following recent comments by the Japanese prime minister on U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>Asked about the level of U.S. Treasury bonds and whether U.S. Treasuries were vulnerable to a large sell-off after Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto commented in late June that Japan was tempted to sell its holdings of U.S. securities in the past, he said: &quot;People should buy bonds wherever they want to buy bonds.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Japanese investors, German investors, and also central banks around the world buy U.S. Treasuries not to be kind to America, but because they think it is in their own self-interest,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I think as long as people are motivated by self-interest, then that's the rule of the market and how we should live with it. I don't think there is excessive vulnerability now.&quot;</p>
<p>Regarding the collapse of the price of gold, Lindsey said: &quot;There is a lot of central bank selling. Central banks hold substantial portions of gold.&quot; He said it was not so much a supply-demand factor that was causing the price of gold to fall, but rather a change in the attitude of central banks.</p>
