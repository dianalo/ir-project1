<p>Bankgesellschaft Berlin AG, the state-owned German bank, on Friday reported a slump in net profit to 47 million marks ($27.3 million) in 1996 from 476 million due to a surge in risk provisions.</p>
<p>But Bankgesellschaft, Germany's sixth largest listed bank, said it was keeping its dividend unchanged at 1.10 marks because it expected earnings to stabilise in 1997.</p>
<p>Profit was hit by a sharp rise in the need for loan loss provisions, Bankgesellschaft said in a mandatory statement released after a supervisory board meeting.</p>
<p>The slump came as no surprise to the stock market after the bank said in December it was setting aside 2.2 billion marks to cover problem loans amid an economic downturn in its home region of Berlin and east Germany.</p>
<p>The bank's shares even bucked a decline in the overall share market to trade up 0.3 percent or 0.10 marks at 32.80 marks in after-bourse dealing after the results.</p>
<p>Germany's top five banks were all lower as the sector has fallen out of favour with investors after a surge in recent months.</p>
<p>Operating profit after risk provisions fell to 355 million marks from 958 million marks. Before risk provisions, operating profit totalled 1.78 billion marks, up 5.6 percent.</p>
<p>The group balance sheet total rose 19.9 percent to 337.5 billion marks.</p>
<p>&quot;The profit fall did not surprise me, Bankgesellschaft is a typical turnaround candidate,&quot; said Dieter Hein, banking analyst at BHF-Bank, who said he was maintaining his &quot;speculative buy&quot; recommendation for the stock.</p>
<p>Hein predicted earnings per share would show a loss of two marks for 1996 but a profit of 3.20 marks for 1997 and 3.40 marks for 1998.</p>
<p>Bankgesellschaft, 56.8 percent owned by the state of Berlin, had given itself a clean slate with last year's allocation to loan loss reserves and provisions were set to fall sharply this year and next, Hein said.</p>
<p>But he added he may revise his projections after next Monday's news conference at which Bankgesellschaft will unveil detailed results for 1996.</p>
<p>Hein also criticised the bank for declining to hold an analysts' meeting on its 1996 results and refusing to conduct bilateral interviews with analysts until August.</p>
<p>&quot;A bank in such a situation should not refuse to give information to analysts,&quot; Hein said. The bank's investor relations department could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>In a move which fuelled speculation about mergers in Germany's overcrowded banking sector, Bankgesellschaft and Norddeutsche Landesbank, a regional bank, got the go-ahead from their state owners last year to intensify talks about increasing cooperation.</p>
<p>But analysts say the banks are less enthusiastic about a tie-up than their owners, who are expected to profit from any merger by placing a portion of their stake with private investors afterwards.</p>
<p>NordLB is owned by the states of Lower Saxony, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Saxony-Anhalt.</p>
