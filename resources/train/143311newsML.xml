<p>Poland's lower house of parliament on Friday approved a bill curbing pension rises, one of the first in a legislative package aimed at reforming the country's inefficient social security system.</p>
<p>The bill, passed by 257 to 65 votes with 77 abstentions, would subject pension rises to annual negotiations and guarantee that they would not fall in real terms.</p>
<p>Under the bill, which needs to clear the senate and be signed by the president, pension rises would be negotiated in a special Trilateral Commission grouping representatives of the government, trade unions, employers and other organisations.</p>
<p>The result would be subject to parliament's decision each year during the budget debate, but would not be below the forecast growth of prices of a special basket of goods.</p>
<p>The present law, suspended for this year by a special bill securing 2.5 percent real pensions growth in 1996, pegs pension rises to average wage increases.</p>
<p>The goverment argues the system cannot be sustained as growth in real wages has forced up budget subsidies to the social security system.</p>
<p>The subsidies have reached more than 20 percent of budget revenues and if not checked will rise further because of the ageing of Polish society.</p>
<p>The new bill introduces two pension rises a year, in March and September, if annual inflation is higher than 10 percent, and only one, in June, if inflation falls below 10 percent.</p>
<p>The labour ministry has said the draft law, due to take effect next year, would be followed by four bills launching the reforms by the end of March 1997.</p>
<p>The bills will include two crucial ones -- on the creation of new privately-managed pension funds and on endowing these funds with shares of firms undergoing privatisation.</p>
<p>The bill on pension rises should guarantee a real pension increase of 1.5 percent next year.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Labour Minister Andrzej Baczkowski said real growth in pensions should reach four percent in 1997 because pensioners would also get a one-off back payment dating from 1995, as the result of a constitutional court ruling.</p>
<p>The bill has to be passed by the upper house within seven days because it was sent to parliament as urgent. President Aleksander Kwasniewski will then have another seven days to sign it into law.</p>
