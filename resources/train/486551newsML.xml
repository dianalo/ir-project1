<headline>Dow Jones seeks reversal of libel award.</headline>
<dateline>HOUSTON 1997-04-02</dateline>

<p>Dow Jones &amp; Co. Inc. has asked a federal judge to overturn a record $222.7 million judgment levied in a libel suit, warning that it would have a &quot;staggering effect&quot; on journalism if allowed to stand.</p>
<p>The media giant, which owns the Wall Street Journal, said in court documents unveiled on Wednesday that &quot;the enormity of the jury's verdict in this case cannot be overstated&quot;.</p>
<p>But attorneys for plaintiff MMAR Group Inc. said the verdict &quot;easily passes constitutional muster&quot; and should be approved by U.S. District Judge Ewing Werlein.</p>
<p>A seven-person jury awarded the damages on March 21 to MMAR, a now-defunct securities firm, which charged in a lawsuit that it was forced out of business by an unflattering 1993 article in the Journal.</p>
<p>The award was the largest ever in a libel suit, easily eclipsing the previous record of $58 million against the Dallas-based A.H. Belo Corp. in a 1991 trial.</p>
<p>The jury found that parts of the Journal article, written by reporter Laura Jereski, were incorrect and malicious.</p>
<p>But Dow Jones said the story was &quot;substantially true&quot; and that malice was not present.</p>
<p>&quot;So long as the verdict stands, its mere existence will have a staggering deterrent effect on vigorous business and financial reporting in (Texas) and elsewhere,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>The article charged that MMAR's mishandling of complex financial instruments had resulted in losses for a Louisiana pension fund.</p>
<p>MMAR said the story was wrong and had so injured the company's reputation that its revenues immediately dropped by 52 percent. A month later, it was out of business.</p>
<p>Werlein, who presided over the two-week-long trial, was to take the arguments under consideration. He could affirm the jury's decision, overturn all or part of it, or reduce the damages. No matter what his decision, the case will almost certainly be appealed to the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, attorneys said.</p>
