<headline>FORECAST - Poll experts tip more gains for UK Labour.</headline>

<p>Britain's top election experts on Wednesday increased their forecasts for a large Labour majority as the ruling Conservatives made no progress in clawing back a huge opposition lead in public opinion polls.</p>
<p>In a poll of 20 political experts on their predictions for the outcome of the May 1 general election, the mean forecast pointed to an 83-seat Labour majority in the 659-seat House of Commons, up from a 77-seat average prediction they gave a week ago.</p>
<p>Nineteen of the 20 members of the Reuters panel believe Labour will win the election -- one expects a hung parliament -- and six expect a majority of more than 100 seats for Labour after 18 years in opposition.</p>
<p>Paul Whitely, lecturer at the University of Sheffield, said experts were revising their predictions up because the Labour lead in public opinion polls had not diminished.</p>
<p>&quot;There is no evidence that Conservative support is re-emerging. As we go along, the possibility of a Labour landslide becomes greater,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The predictions in the Reuters survey ranged from David Carlton, lecturer in politics at the University of Warwick, who predicts a hung parliament, to John Curtice at the University of Strathclyde, who forecasts a 185-seat majority for Labour.</p>
<p>But although the experts are increasing their predictions for Labour as the election nears, they still fall well behind the levels of support for Labour being registered in public opinion polls.</p>
<p>While the experts on average showed Labour with a 10-point lead over the Conservatives with 45 percent of the vote, most opinion polls put the gap between the two main parties at 20 percentage points or more.</p>
<p>The latest Reuters/NOP opinion poll published on Monday showed Labour support at 51 percent, 21 points ahead of the Conservatives. Translated into seats under a widely-used formula devised by political analysts Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher, this would give Labour a 221-seat majority.</p>
<p>Ivor Crewe, vice-chancellor at the University of Essex, believes the explanation for the gap between public polls and the opinion of the Reuters panel was two-fold.</p>
<p>&quot;The first is that because we have never witnessed in living memory a lead of this magnitude by any party, nobody can believe it,&quot; said Crewe. &quot;And second, because they can't believe, they think it will have to come down.&quot;</p>
<p>Issues uppermost in voters' minds were the economy, specifically health and education. The public see the track record on both as negative for the Conservatives, the experts said.</p>
<p>They said allegations of corruption and sex scandals had severely dented support for the Conservatives, and the effect had filtered through to perceptions of incompetence.</p>
<p>Part of the problem for the Conservatives was the difference between Prime Minister John Major and Tony Blair, leader of the opposition, the experts said.</p>
<p>&quot;John Major cannot control his ministers, they squabble in the public eye and people also believe that the sleaze is something which should by now be under control. So it's not just economic incompetence, it's overall incompetence,&quot; said one expert.</p>
<p>&quot;But Tony Blair has managed to gag the unions and the extremists, at least for now. Labour is managing to present a united front.&quot;</p>
