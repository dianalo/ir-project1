<p>Russian communists and nationalists welcomed a Union Treaty signed between Moscow and Belarus on Wednesday, even though it fell short of their dream of an outright union.</p>
<p>Others said the treaty was premature and were concerned by some of its aspects.</p>
<p>The signing of the treaty &quot;is the most sober step by President Boris Yeltsin over the past five years&quot;, said Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of Russia's communists.</p>
<p>&quot;I congratulate you all,&quot; he told a news conference. &quot;We live in a Union again...which stretches from Brest (on the Polish border) to Vladivostok (in the Far East).&quot;</p>
<p>Zyuganov told Ekho Moskvy radio he hoped former Soviet republics Ukraine and Kazakhstan, Russia's biggest neighbours, would soon follow Belarus' example. &quot;They will see that we live better and will join us,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>But Kazakhstan, Russia's Central Asian neighbour, was not overly upbeat about the document signed in Moscow.</p>
<p>Krymbek Kusherbayev, President Nursultan Nazarbayev's spokesman, said Kazakhstan was happy to see a union between Russia and Belarus, but warned it was concerned by some aspects of the treaty and by the speed of its adoption.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan is worried by possible consequences of the treaty, as it has a number of trade disputes with Russia and important documents on cooperation that have not yet been ratified by Moscow.</p>
<p>Kusherbayev added that the union could also speed up the process of disintegration within Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead of working for the cause of unification, the union treaty may cause disagreements within Russia. A number of Russia's regions, Chechnya, for example, may demand a similar treaty for themselves,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Russia's popular law-and-order General Alexander Lebed said the union was premature.</p>
<p>&quot;I am not an opponent of integration, but this building must be constructed from the basement up, while it is now being constructed from the roof down. Such buildings do not last long,&quot; Lebed told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;Before (the treaty is signed)...it is necessary to work hard in the economic sphere, to harmonise legislation in the two countries, carry out other important steps -- and only then can a political treaty crown the efforts.&quot;</p>
<p>Lebed criticised the behind-the-scenes preparation of the treaty. &quot;Do we have a tsar or a president in our country? If we have a president he should have informed the people about the conditions of integration,&quot; Lebed said.</p>
<p>Liberal deputies in the State Duma lower parliament house said the document harmed Russia's interests as a sovereign state, while a liberal deputy, Yuli Rybakov, called the treaty a coup attempt.</p>
<p>&quot;Russia is being occupied by the pro-fascist regime of Lukashenko,&quot; the radical leader of Russia's Democratic Union party, Valeriya Novodvorskaya, told Ekho Moskvy.</p>
<p>She and a handful of liberal deputies staged a protest picket outside the Duma building.</p>
<p>But the opposition-dominated Duma was unimpressed.</p>
<p>On a proposal from deputy speaker Sergei Baburin, the legislature will discuss a motion to &quot;pave the way to stage-by-stage reunification of Russia and Belarus and creation of a single sovereign state&quot;.</p>
