<text>
<p>Sixteen members of Ethiopia's national soccer who had gone missing in Rome resurfaced on Wednesday and asked for political asylum.</p>
<p>&quot;They have asked for political asylum,&quot; lawyer Mario Lana told reporters at the foreigners' office at Rome police headquarters.</p>
<p>Lana, who accompanied the players to the office where requests for permits of stay are reviewed, said it was still not clear if they would be able to play soccer in Italy if their request was granted.</p>
<p>The 16 members went missing before they were due to fly to Casablanca for an African National Cup match.</p>
<p>The players arrived in Italy on Monday afternoon from Addis Ababa and were scheduled to fly to Casablanca on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Early on Tuesday morning 16 members, including the coach, left their hotel with their passports and their luggage, according the hotel manager.</p>
<p>Seven members of the original group were still in Rome.</p>
