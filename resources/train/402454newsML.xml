<p>About 80 percent of small business proprietors in Australia believe the government's policies are either working against them or had no real impact, according to a survey released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The survey, conducted by Telstra Corp's half-owned telephone directory subsidiary Yellow Pages Australia, found that negative assessments of government policies outweighed positive assessments for the first time since the March 1996 election.</p>
<p>It showed that 22 percent of small businesses now believed government policies worked against them, compared with 20 percent which believed they were supportive.  </p>
<p>The number of positive assessments was less than half the peak figure reported in the first post-election survey in May last year, according to a commentary on the survey.</p>
<p>Survey economic adviser John Marsden said the disenchantment stemmed from the failure of economic growth and recovery to flow through to small business, and from the sector's frustration with perceived government inaction.</p>
<p>More than 80 percent of the 1,200 proprietors randomly surveyed believed the economy was still in recession and nearly 80 percent believed the government had not helped small business at all, he said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Moreover, three-quarters of proprietors reported that recent interest rates cuts had not, to date, improved their business fortunes,&quot; Marsden said.</p>
<p>&quot;Given the critical role of the small business sector in job creation, these findings must be of concern to the government and the unemployed,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The survey also found that the small business confidence was unchanged from the low levels recorded in the August and November surveys.  </p>
<p>&quot;Until confidence and sales growth return to the nation's small businesses, proprietors will clearly not invest in capital or people,&quot; Marsden said.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted between January 24 and February 5. -- Canberra Bureau 61-6 273-2730</p>
