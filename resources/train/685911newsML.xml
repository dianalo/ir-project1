<p>Thai opposition leaders on Wednesday demanded Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh clarify government policy on the embattled baht and measures to revive the troubled finance and property sectors.</p>
<p>Chavalit's predecessors Chuan Leekpai and Banharn Silpa-archa also accused the ruling coalition of surreptitious budgeting in the first parliamentary debate on the proposed fiscal 1998 budget (October-September).</p>
<p>Chuan sought assurances for local and foreign investors from new Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya that he would meet Chavalit's pledge to keep the baht's exchange rate regime unchanged. Thanong has not replied yet.</p>
<p>The baht came under speculative attack in May on rumours it may be devalued amid a chronic economic crisis facing Thailand, but stabilised after a successful defence by the Bank of Thailand with the help of regional central banks.</p>
<p>Thailand is suffering its worst economic crisis in more than a decade, hit by high interest rates, a sharply slowing economy, sluggish exports and a liquidity crunch affecting the troubled finance and property sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;The central bank has been obsessive in defending the baht through its high interest rate policy, without showing any concern for business which has been choked by high funding costs,&quot; opposition member Newin Chidchob said in parliament.</p>
<p>Bangkok MP Sudarat Kaeyurapan said: &quot;The economic crisis has spread to every sector. About 2,000 companies have gone bankrupt this year, putting some 40,000 people out of jobs.&quot; Chavalit introduced to parliament a 982 billion baht ($39.3 billion) budget for next year, calling it an austerity bill that reflected the Thai economic slowdown that began before his government took office last November.</p>
<p>Debate during the first reading of the budget bill is due to last three days. The bill is likely to pass since Chavalit's coalition controls 222 of 393 seats in the house.</p>
<p>Thailand is expected to post its first budget deficit in a decade in fiscal 1997 as the economic slowdown cuts into tax revenue. Opposition leaders said they expected at least a 17-billion-baht budget deficit next year.</p>
<p>&quot;The economic slowdown has made it very tough for the government to propose a balanced, deficit-free budget... I believe the (1997/98) austerity budget is appropriate under current...bearish financial sector conditions in the country,&quot; Chavalit told parliament.</p>
<p>Predicting a mild economic recovery next year, Chavalit gave conservative projections for 1997 that included 5.7 percent gross domestic product growth against an expected 5.6 percent expansion this year, with inflation easing marginally to 4.4 percent from 4.5.</p>
<p>The central bank has scaled down its 1997 GDP growth projection several times, to 5.9 percent last month from the 7.1 percent predicted early this year and against 6.4 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Chavalit said exports should grow by seven percent this year and in 1998 after contracting 0.2 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>&quot;Exports would be a vital indicator of recovery that we pin our hopes on,&quot; he said, adding that his government would strictly adhere to fiscal and monetary disciplines adopted by previous governments.</p>
<p>Banharn Silpa-archa also sought details from the government on its recent measures to prevent the 91-company finance sector from melting down.</p>
<p>The government on Tuesday issued four urgent decrees to avert a crisis in the finance and property sectors. The executive decrees sought to allow greater foreign equity participation in new banks and merging finance firms.</p>
<p>Finance firms are saddled with billions of dollars in non-performing loans, mostly to the property sector.</p>
