<title>USA: U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Euphoria up but bull is raging.</title>
<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Euphoria up but bull is raging.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-06-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Euphoria is creeping into the U.S. stock market, but options analysts and traders said the market appears to be unstoppable, with even a near-term pullback likely to lead to higher prices.</p>
<p>&quot;How can anyone fight it?&quot; asked Jerry Hegarty, an options analyst at Thomson Financial Services, as the Dow industrial average .DJI was up 84 points, or 1.1 percent at about 7,660 around 1215 CDT/1715 GMT.</p>
<p>The broader S&amp;P 500 index was up 8.37 at 877.94 and September S&amp;P 500 futures, the new lead month, gained 9.50 to 888.90. The S&amp;P 100 index added 6.39 to 854.29.  </p>
<p>One sign of investor bullishness has been the high level of equity call buying compared to equity put buying.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Board Options Exchange, equity call volume topped put volume by 197,742 to 60,993 at 1200 CDT/1700 GMT. At 1000 CDT/1500 GMT on the Pacific Exchange, call volume was 25,787 compared with put volume of 12,849.</p>
<p>Hegarty said he had studied past time periods when equity call buying outpaced put buying as it has done recently.</p>
<p>In the past, &quot;when you got equity call buying to levels it's been at, the market always sold off,&quot; he said. &quot;You just didn't withstand that kind of call buying.&quot;  </p>
<p>But Christopher Cadbury, who publishes the Cadbury Fax Service newsletter, said that while equity call buying has been heavy at the CBOE, it has been more restrained at the other three options exchanges.</p>
<p>In the last couple of weeks, he said, equity mutual funds have seen a heavy inflow of cash that has helped drive the market higher in the face of the heavy call buying.</p>
<p>Even so, the market could sell off for a few days &quot;because a lot of the indicators have turned fairly neutral.&quot;</p>
<p>Analysts also noted the market's ability to absorb earnings warnings from key companies and move higher.  </p>
<p>Hegarty said two possible scenarios exist: either the market sells off sharply, satisfying the heavy equity call buying signal, or it remains strong. The second scenario is looking more and more likely, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm thinking call premiums are very rich and there's a lot of speculation in here,&quot; he said. &quot;They should sell off but they just don't do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Jay Shartsis, director of options trading at R.F. Lafferty &amp; Co, said one sign of investor complacency, which is often a precursor to a pullback, is that eight-point moves on S&amp;P 500 futures are beginning to be accepted as normal.  </p>
<p>&quot;This whole thing is madness,&quot; he said of the market's ongoing rally. &quot;No one's ever seen anything like this and no one really knows how to handle it.&quot;</p>
<p>He said one dependable sentiment measure has shown a reading of 77 percent bulls for two days in a row, a level he has not seen in a long time.</p>
<p>&quot;You've got some numbers that are quite extreme,&quot; he said. &quot;Between now and expiration day (June 20) you'll probably get a very sharp setback, and then I think it will come back up after that again.&quot;</p>
