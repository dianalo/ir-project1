<p>The U.S. Davis Cup team said on Thursday they would not let themselves be riled by boisterous Brazilian fans during their World group first round tie beginning on Friday.</p>
<p>They also refused to be intimidated by Brazil's 10-year unbeaten home record in the competition.</p>
<p>Austrian star Thomas Muster stormed out of a qualifying tie in Sao Paulo last year, claiming he had been spat at, that fans had hurled obscenities at him and pointed mirrors at him while he was facing serve.</p>
<p>Brazil were awarded the tie after the International Tennis Federation turned down Austrian protests.</p>
<p>&quot;From what I've heard, I don't think Thomas handled the situation as well as he could have,&quot; said Jim Courier, the Americans' top-ranked player.</p>
<p>&quot;Coming to a country where the fans get very excited about the game is part of the joy and excitement of playing Davis Cup.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing I'm concerned about is what happens inside the lines.&quot;</p>
<p>A spokesman for the local organisers said Brazil had never been sanctioned for crowd behaviour though they had been punished in the past for bad organisation. He added that Muster had been fined $8,000 for his conduct and the Austrian tennis federation $50,000.</p>
<p>U.S. captain Tom Gullikson was equally dismissive about the South Americans' impressive run of home wins. &quot;It's a very good record but records are made to be broken,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Brazil, who reached the semi-finals in 1992 after shock home wins over Germany and Italy, appear to have little realistic chance of another upset as they return to the competition's top flight for the first time since 1993.</p>
<p>Gustavo Kuerten, their top player, is a modest 85th in the world rankings, exactly 50 places below Alex O'Brien, the lowest-ranked of the U.S. team.</p>
<p>Paulo Cleto, begining his 10th year as Brazil's Davis Cup captain, said: &quot;They are the clear favourites for all the obvious reasons.&quot;</p>
<p>The draw paired Kuerten against MaliVai Washington in the first of Friday's opening singles, with Courier facing Fernando Meligeni, who was born in Argentina and is a naturalised Brazilian, in the second.</p>
<p>Washington was called in for the injured Andre Agassi.</p>
<p>Schedule:</p>
<p>(Friday)</p>
<p>Gustavo Kuerten v MaliVai Washington</p>
<p>Fernando Meligeni v Jim Courier</p>
<p>Doubles (Saturday)</p>
<p>Kuerten and Jaime Oncins v Alex O'Brien and Richey Reneberg</p>
<p>Reverse singles (Sunday)</p>
<p>Kuerten v Courier</p>
<p>Meligeni v Washington</p>
