<p>Benchmark Mexican peso contracts closed firmer on Wednesday after dealers sold long dollar positions amid market caution ahead of key inflation data, traders said.</p>
<p>&quot;The peso traded within a very narrow range, so there was not much to do. Some dealers are still long dollars, and that's why the peso firmed up,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour stablemate closed 1.5 and 1.3 centavos firmer, respectively, at 7.8870/7.8890 and 7.8820/7.8850 per dollar.  </p>
<p>Same-day peso contracts had earlier closed 0.6 of a centavo weaker at 7.8750/7.8850 per dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;Many investors went long on dollars before the March 25 Federal Open Market Committee meeting to hedge against an agressive market reaction to U.S. interest rate hikes,&quot; a foreign exchange analyst said.</p>
<p>&quot;But as the markets did not get out of hand, they have had to sell those positions little by little and that is why the peso has been trading firmly,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Traders said market caution was due to inflation data expected shortly after the foreign exchange market closed.  </p>
<p>&quot;Dealers were very much looking forward to inflation data. We need to see the outcome to determine what we'll do tomorrow,&quot; another trader said.</p>
<p>A Reuters survey of Mexico City financial firms showed they expect an average increase of 1.31 percent in the March consumer price index, down from 1.68 percent in February.</p>
<p>Dealers said trading on Thursday would be greatly influenced by the inflation data, and said 48-hour peso contracts could weaken on pre-weekend swaps.  </p>
<p>&quot;The dollar is already very cheap for some and they may take that, or even reactions on the U.S. bond market ahead of Friday's U.S. data, as a pretext to weaken the peso on pre-weekend demand,&quot; a foreign exchange analyst said.</p>
