<p>Roisin McAliskey, a pregnant Irish prisoner in England wanted for questioning in Germany about a guerrilla bombing, will contest a seat in the May 1 British election, her mother said on Thursday.</p>
<p>McAliskey, 25, whose detention has been widely criticised by the Irish government and Catholic politicians, is in London's Holloway jail pending extradition in connection with an IRA attack on a British military base in Osnabrueck last year.</p>
<p>McAliskey plans to stand for election in the Mid-Ulster constituency, where she lives in Northern Ireland, if she is not released on bail to have her baby.</p>
<p>In 1969 her radical nationalist mother Bernadette, using her maiden name Devlin, caused a sensation when she won the same seat at the age of 22. She became the youngest woman ever elected to the British parliament but lost the seat in 1974.</p>
<p>Roisin, eight months pregnant, denies involvement in the attack by the Irish Republican Army as part of a long-running campaign to force Britain to end its rule of Northern Ireland and to merge it with Catholic Ireland.</p>
<p>Bernadette McAliskey told Belfast's nationalist newspaper The Irish News that her daughter was protesting against being refused bail and said an election campaign might mean should could have her baby in freedom.</p>
<p>The decision had not been easy, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;But in the face of the continued refusal of the British court to acknowledge her right to bail and the British administration's racist belligerence, insult and inhumanity, we feel this may be her only opportunity to secure her release before the birth of her child.&quot;</p>
<p>She said if her daughter were granted bail by the time candidates must officially submit their names for election &quot;then the situation would obviously change&quot;.</p>
<p>Bernadette McAliskey called on two other Catholic candidates to give her daughter a clear run in a bid to unseat hardline pro-British Protestant legislator, William McCrea.</p>
<p>But the moderate nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) said that it would not stand aside.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein, the political arm of the IRA, which is also contesting Mid-Ulster, reacted cautiously. It and the SDLP are bitter rivals in a bid to oust McCrea, an outspoken advocate of British rule and member of the Democratic Unionist Party.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland parties are fighting for 18 seats in the British parliament. Protestant &quot;Unionist&quot; parties, representing the 60 per cent pro-British majority, traditionally win most of the seats.</p>
<p>The SDLP recently rejected Sinn Fein overtures for electoral pacts. Sinn Fein said a joint strategy at the polls could lead to eight seats for Catholics, twice as many as now, but the SDLP said the IRA must first abandon a violent campaign which has escalated since December.</p>
