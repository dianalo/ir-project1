<text>
<p>World Cup holders Sri Lanka are to advertise for a coach to replace former Australian test player Dav Whatmore who is quitting to join English county side Lancashire when his contract expires in May next year.</p>
<p>&quot;We will advertise locally and internationally for someone to coach the World Cup champions,&quot; Upali Dharmadasa, president of Sri Lanka's cricket board, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dharmadasa said the board had not anticipated the highly respected Whatmore &quot;leaving at this stage&quot;.</p>
<p>He emphasised that there had been no ill-feeling between Whatmore and the board.</p>
<p>Whatmore took on his coaching role in Sri Lanka in June 1995 after the board failed in their bid to enlist two former test captains, Allan Border and Ian Botham.</p>
