<p>Grocery retailers Woolworths Ltd said on Monday sales for the 12 weeks to March 30, 1997 totalled A$3.57 billion and sales for the 40 weeks to March 30 were A$11.79 billion.  </p>
<p>&quot;In light of current trading conditions in the retail sector this result is pleasing,&quot; Woolworths said.</p>
<p>Woolworths said its third quarter sales rose 10.83 percent, which included the Easter period, while last year's third quarter sales did not include the Easter period. Sales for the 40 weeks were 9.27 percent higher than a year ago, it said. It said like-for-like stores achieved a sales increase of 4.24 percent for the 40 weeks. &quot;Adjusting for the difference in the timing of Easter, the sales trend in the third period is still slightly higher than that of the second period,&quot; it said.  </p>
<p>&quot;Sales in the third period continued to show strong growth in both food and general merchandise,&quot; Woolworths said.</p>
<p>&quot;Sales in specialty retail however were affected by continuing tough trading conditions in women's apparel,&quot; the company said.</p>
<p>Woolworths shares were one cent higher at A$3.63.</p>
