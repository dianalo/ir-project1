<p>Canada's robust economic growth in recent months will likely provide some pleasant surprises for investors when fourth-quarter Canadian corporate earnings roll out over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Optimism about earnings is helping the bull market in Canada keep charging ahead. But analysts said blighted natural resource companies -- with the notable exception of oil and gas producers -- would probably post poor results in contrast with other business sectors.</p>
<p>&quot;I think you're going to see surprising numbers on the upside right across the board. And I say that coming from a macro (economic) view,&quot; predicted Bob Boaz, a market strategist at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>&quot;The way the economy has been performing, it's been surprising a lot of people through the fourth quarter...the trade balance in Canada has been moving ahead by leaps and bounds and that normally translates into good profitability,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Industrial products companies were expected to beat analysts' forecasts, particularly those firms that export a lot of their output south of the border, said Jim Doak, senior vice-president, investment research, at brokerage ScotiaMcLeod Inc.</p>
<p>&quot;(Industrial products) should be solid. The export numbers that we have been seeing have been good, so that implies that the exports of manufactured goods remain intact,&quot; noted Dunnery Best, director of private client investing at Midland brokerage Walwyn Inc.</p>
<p>Boaz said industrial products concerns likely to deliver solid earnings advances included Unican Security Systems Ltd., Premdor Inc., Skyjack Inc., Spar Aerospace Ltd., Northern Telecom Ltd. and Newbridge Networks Corp..</p>
<p>While fourth-quarter economic data have not yet been released, economists polled in a Reuters survey forecast that Canada's merchandise trade balance would show a surplus of C$2.92 billion ($2.18 billion) in November, compared to C$1.49 billion ($1.12 billion) in October. The official data are due out Friday.</p>
<p>Real estate and energy were among other sectors that would likely turn in a good quarterly performance, analysts said.</p>
<p>The once-moribund real estate group has heated up recently as Canada's bargain-basement interest rates boost occupancy and lease rates in the industrial, office and retail areas.</p>
<p>Oil and gas producers should benefit from the recent gusher in crude oil and gas prices, making them an exception in the natural resource world.</p>
<p>&quot;I think a lot of the resource companies will do relatively poorly, with the exception of the energy sector. Metals, forest products, I think are going to report a very bad fourth quarter,&quot; said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer and Co.</p>
<p>&quot;(Oil and gas) I think should show a very strong fourth quarter. And I expect prices to remain firm and to actually edge up in 1997 and refining margins also will improve,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Metz said the tail-end of 1996 and the beginning of 1997 could mark a low for many commodity prices, which, he believed, could turn sharply upward during the year.</p>
<p>Most analysts reckon forest products and mining companies had a tough time eking out profits for the fourth quarter and for 1996 as a whole.</p>
<p>But many major gold producers hedged, or sold forward, much of their production, which should offset the impact of the slide in world bullion prices and help cushion earnings.</p>
