<p>FCC Chairman Reed Hundt on Tuesday urged broadcasters to seek an anti-trust waiver to allow them to meet to come up with a code regulating liquor ads on television.</p>
<p>That code could lead to companies that produce hard liquor eventually putting ads promoting their products on the air.</p>
<p>But Edward Fritts, the head of the National Association of Broadcasters, said later in the day he doesn't understand why the liquor industry would do an about-face on a code that has been in place for decades, barring such ads.</p>
<p>&quot;We have a code. Every network has its own code,&quot; Fritts said, adding. &quot;If it's not on the air now, it seems to be a solution in search of a problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Hundt, in an address at the NAB's annual convention in Las Vegas, seemed to indicate that he wanted the broadcasting industry to sit down and hammer out regulations that would not permit liquor ads on television -- a forum now reserved for wine and beer.</p>
<p>Such a meeting would normally be prohibited under anti- trust laws.</p>
<p>&quot;This is not an issue that should be allowed to be swept under the table,&quot; Hundt said in an address at the annual National Association of Broadcasters convention. The liquor industry, he said, &quot;is hoping to wear everybody down.&quot;</p>
<p>Ultimately, if the liquor industry prevails, &quot;what you will be doing is impugning the very value of free local TV,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Hundt also addressed the advent of digital television and the prospect of free political advertising as a condition of receiving a digital television license.</p>
<p>Recently, the FCC set in motion a process that is to lead to digital broadcasting within the next 18 months. Regulators also are calling for all-digital television by 2006.</p>
<p>Hundt said he wants many of the decisions affecting the technology used in digital television to be dictated by the marketplace - not by the FCC.</p>
<p>It will be up to broadcasters to determine whether it goes with a traditional TV manufacturing model, a subscription-based service or technology pushed by the computer industry.</p>
<p>Hundt said that not only are those decisions that he believes the FCC should stay out of, but that they should likely be made on a market-by-market, station-by-station basis.</p>
<p>&quot;Let's trust the marketplace,&quot; he said. &quot;Let's let competition decide that. ... These are not decisions we think government should be making.&quot;</p>
