<p>Bundesbank council member Helmut Hesse said on Tuesday that he saw no grounds for the Bundesbank to either tighten or loosen its monetary course.</p>
<p>In a speech prepared for delivery to a reception in the eastern German town of Magdeburg, Hesse said the Bundesbank could not use its own interest rates to push long-term rates lower under current conditions and would be judged severely by markets if it drifted from its anti-inflation policy.</p>
<p>&quot;Under the given conditions it is probably not possible for the Bundesbank to steer long-term rates lower,&quot; he said.  </p>

<p>Hesse warned that under certain circumstances, such as in the case where market interest rates were pushed higher by worries about Europe's Economic and Monetary Union, a German interest rate cut would not be able to counter the worries.</p>
<p>On the contrary, concerns that the new euro could bring increased inflation if too many countries joined the single currency group could be further fanned by such a move, he said.</p>
<p>Turning to the domestic impact of a possible rate cut, Hesse said that there were few signs that lower bank rates would help to stimulate investment, which had remained weak despite the fact that rates were already at historic lows.</p>
<p>Monetary policy could also do very little to help reduce unemployment, he said.</p>
<p>&quot;A switch to even more expansion is not appropriate, nor is a tightening of the stability course,&quot; Hesse said.</p>
<p>He rejected that critcism voiced by some that, given that inflation was now at just 1.5 percent, the Bundesbank was overshooting on its stability course and heading for deflation.</p>
<p>He said such criticism was &quot;not justifiable and should therefore be rejected.&quot;</p>
