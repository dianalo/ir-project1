<headline>EU Grains - A break from sliding prices, for now.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Benchmark grains firmed up from near intervention lows in the European Union market this week providing some respite from sliding prices. But many traders, discouraged by diminished export prospects and steady output, still seemed bearish about prospects.</p>
<p>In France, wheat prices for prompt deliveries were underpinned by logistic problems as exporters scrambled to find grain to cover a few cargoes for shipment out of Rouen.</p>
<p>Higher UK prices were linked to light short-covering, mainly related to sterling fluctuations while in Germany wheat seemed to have found a floor with increased local and eastern demand.</p>
<p>Spain was the only exception to price hikes this week as local and imported supplies continued to exert pressure.</p>
<p>The European focus turned again to the Commission's export policy as traders sought ways to foil aggressive competition from Argentine wheat in traditional European outlets.</p>
<p>Some traders were disappointed by last week's increase in the EU wheat export rebate to 22.35 Ecus a tonne.</p>
<p>But the European Commission Director-General Davod Roberts said on Wednesday that cautious policies would continue in the rest of the 1996/97 campaign due to budgetary restrictions.</p>
<p>French traders said less wheat was available in port silos than initially thought and with the sugar harvest in full swing trucks for grain transportation were in short supply.</p>
<p>Traders said the outcome of Egypt's tender on Friday for 100,000 tonnes of Argentine and 50,000 tonnes of U.S./French wheat could provide clues to the direction of world prices.</p>
<p>Germany saw a hesitant recovery in eastern European milling wheat demand and feed wheat requirements from compounders.</p>
<p>But country merchant and cooperative buying at the farmgate was slowing because German top wheat qualities could not be marketed in third country markets, brokers said.</p>
<p>In the fob Baltic export market, normal bread wheat (12 percent) was offered at a steady 282.50-287.50 but higher quality material was stronger in a 287.50-305 marks range.</p>
<p>Barley markets suffered from British and Danish competition but fob sellers kept prices stable at 250-270 marks.</p>
<p>UK barley was easier and although wheat recovered slightly, traders saw the move as temporary with increased farm sales reported. Buying was not expected to pick up until after Christmas.</p>
<p>&quot;One or two nervous shots were taking positions in very little volume,&quot; said one trader.</p>
<p>The French maize harvest was winding down in the southwest of the country and cooperatives are under less pressure to move their grain promptly from silos. This helped prompt maize prices stabilise at last week's levels.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, maize commanded a higher price in Italy on increasing demand from feed producers.</p>
<p>Almost all of the crop has been harvested but there are still no estimates of final production, but traders reckoned prices could rise further once harvest officially ends.</p>
<p>Italian buyers were bargain hunting for cereals after severe price drops in the past months.</p>
<p>&quot;It would have been difficult for durum wheat prices to stay under the 300,000 lire per tonne threshold,&quot; one dealer said adding that producers were also reluctant to sell their crop at current prices..</p>
<p>Spanish cereal prices retreated further, also because the market is well supplied by imported material and cooperatives were releasing crops previously held back.</p>
<p>Maize dropped in line with weaker Chicago prices after an increase in U.S. supply estimates.</p>
<p>This is how benchmark European grains performed this week. All prices are per tonne. French prices exclude carry.</p>
