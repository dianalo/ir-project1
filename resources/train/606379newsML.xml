<title>UK: U.S. stocks in London static, eye volatile dollar.</title>
<headline>U.S. stocks in London static, eye volatile dollar.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-05-22</dateline>

<p>U.S. shares were little changed on Thursday from Wall Street's closing prices as current volatility in the currency markets kept many European investors away, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;The swings in the dollar have killed the market today. We've had very little business,&quot; one dealer said.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency charged higher in Europe on Thursday to stand near 116 yen by 1030 GMT, up over two yen from late Wednesday.</p>
<p>Against the German mark, the dollar eased off its highs to stand at 1.6921/26 against earlier peaks just above 1.70.  </p>
<p>Only a handful of shares had traded by late morning. AT&amp;T Corp was up $1/8 to $34-3/4 after Chairman Robert Allen told shareholders at the company's annual meeting on Wednesday that boosting the phone giant's flagging stock price was management's highest priority.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T shares, which closed at a 12-month low of $30.75 on April 24, gained 37.50 cents to end Wednesday's session at $34.625. The stock has underperformed the S&amp;P 500 by around 55 percent over the past 52 weeks, according to data from Reuters Securities 3000.</p>
<p>But historic comparisons are complicated due to the 1996 divestiture of Lucent Technologies Inc. and NCR Corp, AT&amp;T's former equipment and computer arms.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T stock remains the most widely held publicly listed stock in the U.S., with more than 3.3 million shareholders owning about 1.6 billion shares, according to a company spokesman.</p>
<p>Boeing Corp was up $1/4 to $102-3/4 after the company said on Wednesday that it remained confident that its planned merger with McDonnell Douglas Corp would be completed this summer despite formal objections from the European Commission.</p>
<p>The June S&amp;P 500 futures contract was down 0.40 to 842.55 while the June T-bond eased 2/32 to 109-7/32.</p>
