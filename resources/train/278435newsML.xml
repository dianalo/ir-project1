<p>Belgian retail group Delhaize said on Friday it planned further expansions of its U.S. Food Lion unit in order to maintain its leadership position in the southern U.S.</p>
<p>&quot;Food Lion wants to remain among the top 10 distributors in the U.S.,&quot; Gui de Vaucleroy, chief executive of Delhaize, told Belgian financial daily L'Echo, explaining why Delhaize's U.S. food unit Food Lion recently bought Kash 'n Karry.</p>
<p>Vaucleroy said Food Lion aimed to build about 50 stores per year in the 14 states where it is present, and possibly also in the peripheral regions.</p>
<p>Consolidation would also be achieved through a &quot;remodelling&quot; by enlargement and relocation of around 120 stores per year.</p>
<p>Vaucleroy said one of the company's paths to growth was through acquisitions, which had started at the beginning of the year with the purchase of  Food Fair and more recently the $341 million Kash 'n Karry deal.</p>
<p>He said Food Lion and Kash 'n Karry would together have 22-23 percent of the market in the South and Southeast of the U.S., placing them second in the region.</p>
<p>Vaucleroy said he wanted to maintain the group's leadership position in the south and southeast of the U.S. but was considering an expansion into neighbouring states. He said he did not want to move into the west coast.</p>
<p>Vaucleroy rejected the idea that Delhaize Le Lion SA, which received 60 to 70 percent of its turnover from Food Lion, was very dollar sensitive.</p>
<p>&quot;We do not share financial analysts' view who estimate that we are very sensitive to the dollar&quot;.</p>
