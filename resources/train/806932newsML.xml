<p>A four percent drop on Germany's IBIS DAX index on Monday prompted fears the rampant bull run of recent weeks may be over, but German chartists soothed nerves and said the upward trend remains intact.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX stood at 4,038.59 points, down 38.67 points or 0.95 percent, off earlier lows of 3,965.31 points. Overall the DAX has risen 55 percent since January compared with about 30 percent for the Dow Jones Industrial index on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Chartists were generally confident that the bullish trend which has driven record gains on the DAX, was not yet over and that the current correction merely represents a much-needed breather for the German share market.</p>
<p>&quot;We have broken the 40-day (moving average) line moving downwards on the IBIS DAX for the first time since April of this year. We are going to see further corrections in the share market in the medium term,&quot; Giro Olbertz, chartist at Vereins- und Westbank said.</p>
<p>There were widespread fears over the weekend that the decline on the Dow Jones on Friday, which saw the index lose around 250 points, would translate into a crash in Germany, but there are no technical reasons for these concerns.</p>
<p>&quot;I certainly don't think we have seen the lowest point of this consolidation, but thoughts of a crash are exaggerated. I still believe that the bull market is not over yet and we will see some more all-time highs this year,&quot; Wieland Staud, analyst at Yamaichi Bank in Frankfurt, said.</p>
<p>Marcel Muessler, chartist at DG Bank in Frankfurt, sees all the signs of a classic correction.</p>
<p>&quot;It's a classic reversal. The next Fibonacci Retracement which can be technically establised and therefore counts as significant, is at 3,980 points and then 3,825 points,&quot; Mussler said.</p>
<p>&quot;But there is little danger of a change in the upward trend and I think we could be back up at 4,500 points within four or five weeks, with sinking levels of volatility,&quot; Muessler said.</p>
<p>Opinions among the analysts differ on the how long it will take for the DAX to re-enter record-breaking territory.</p>
<p>&quot;Within half a year or a year we will be back up to the old highs. By year-end we are forecasting the DAX should be back at between 4,000 and 4,200 points,&quot; Olbertz said, adding that the highs of 1997 are behind us for the moment.</p>
<p>&quot;We are forecasting that the IBIS DAX will reach 3,650 points within the next three or four weeks. If resistance holds at the 3,650 level, then we will have seen the end of the correction,&quot; Olbertz said.</p>
<p>Wieland Staud is more optimistic, but believes that the market is heading for a rollercoaster period.</p>
<p>&quot;I think the DAX has entered a consolidation period which will last for between six to eight weeks. I think that we will see the DAX move in a range of between 3,850 points and 4,400 points -- we are entering a very volatile period,&quot; Staud said.</p>
<p>Mussler said: &quot;We are expecting the market to stay high now but to take a break in the autumn. The market has been weak for 10 out of the last 13 September/October periods.&quot;</p>
