<p>A U.N. weapons inspector erred in entering a church and a monastery near Baghdad but did not carry out an inspection, a senior U.N. official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The official was responding to Iraqi charges that a U.N. arms inspection team had committed a &quot;flagrant aggression&quot; earlier by entering the buildings.</p>
<p>Gustavo Zlauvinen, political adviser to chief U.N. weapons inspector Rolf Ekeus, said the incident occurred when a team led by an official of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and including members of the U.N. special commission (UNSCOM) in charge of disarming Iraq approached a group of buildings to conduct an inspection.</p>
<p>The team leader had not known they included religious establishments. But when he saw they included a church and a monastery, he erred in accepting a priest's invitation to enter for a few minutes, Zlauvinen said. The other team members remained outside.</p>
<p>&quot;We don't consider it as being an inspection but rather a visit. In any case, we consider it was a personal mistake to even just go into the church and monastery....and we apologise for the inconvenience we caused, if any,&quot; he added.</p>
