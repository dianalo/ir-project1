<p>Police said on Friday they had detained two men suspected of selling hand grenades used in a spate of bombings in Budapest in the past two months.</p>
<p>The Hungarian capital's police chief, Janos Bodracska, told a news conference that the men had been held on Thursday night after being found in possession of 28 grenades and other explosives.</p>
<p>Budapest has been rocked since September by a gangland turf war that has seen more than a dozen hand grenade attacks on nightclubs and restaurants and at least four shootings, one of them fatal.</p>
<p>The latest attack was on Friday when an unidentified assailant first shot at a 52-year-old Budapest casino owner and then struck him with the gun before fleeing.</p>
<p>Bodracska said the two men held on Thursday  had admitted selling nine handgrenades. Police were now conducting searches which have already unearthed a Stinger rocket in a house in a village in southwest Hungary.</p>
<p>The police chief added that the black-market price of a hand grenade was currently 10,000 forints ($60) in Budapest.</p>
<p>The gangland war began over a sum of 2.7 billion forints, borrowed by an underworld figure at high interest, Bodracska said.</p>
<p>&quot;He used the money and the sum was dwindling, and when it got too low, he disappered,&quot; Bodracska said. &quot;Now we cannot find him and (the gangs) can't either.&quot;</p>
<p>He said the only casualties of the gang war had been criminals but that the property of ordinary citizens, such as cars, had been damaged. ($1=161.31 Forint)</p>
