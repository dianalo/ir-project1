<p>Jakarta call money was traded at 14.0/15.0 percent on Monday morning, dealers said.</p>
<p>The central bank money policy was neutral on Monday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the carry-forward effect from last Friday was still felt in the market as some banks moved to cover their shortages early on fear of a possible repeat.</p>
<p>Overnight money soared to a high of 45 percent before settling at 40 percent late on Friday. Dealers said the jump was technical and was not due to fundamental changes.</p>
<p>One European bank dealer said overnight rates' jump last Friday seemed to unsettle some small banks, which boosted their rupiah reserves and kept overnight money at 14.5 percent.</p>
<p>Longer-term rates were up, with one-week money traded at 14.00/14.25 and one-month at 13.50/13.75 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>One local bank dealer said rates should stabilise further because some banks had misread the market last Friday.</p>
<p>The central bank lowered its six-month bilateral papers (SBIs) by 25 basis points to 11.25 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>The central bank offered overnight SBIs at five percent, seven-day at seven percent, two-week at 8.25 percent, one-month at 10.25 percent, three at 10.75 percent, six at 11.25 percent and 12-month at 12.0 percent.</p>
<p>Bond dealers said focus was still on the primary market, with volume on the secondary market remaining thin.</p>
<p>The average overnight interbank rate on Friday was 15.93 percent, compared with 10.79 percent on Thursday.</p>
