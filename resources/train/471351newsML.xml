<p>Barcelona's world player of the year, Ronaldo, looks to be heading to Rome, according to Italian newspaper reports on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Brazilian, who has already scored 23 goals in the Spanish league this season, has been given permission to meet Sergio Cragnotti, the owner of Serie A club Lazio, the day after Barcelona's European Cup Winners' Cup semifinal against Fiorentina on April 24.</p>
<p>The possible move has been given the blessing of the Italian media and, it would appear, Ronaldo's sponsors.</p>
<p>&quot;Ronaldo-Lazio, another yes,&quot; declared the Corriere dello Sport newspaper in a front page headline, reporting that his main sponsor Nike had said it would not object to him moving to the mid-table club.</p>
<p>&quot;All roads lead to Lazio...&quot; read a photo caption.</p>
<p>The headline was &quot;Ronaldo, we're here.&quot;</p>
<p>Tuttosport meanwhile printed a photo-montage of the player wearing a Lazio strip next to a team line-up showing the Brazilian along with Sampdoria veteran Roberto Mancini, another player who has been linked with a move to Rome.</p>
<p>However, newspapers have also pointed out that the terms of Lazio's current sponsorship deal with Umbro, rivals of Nike, could scupper any deal.</p>
<p>The speculation has been growing since Ronaldo declared on Monday that the &quot;door is open&quot; for him to leave Barcelona at the end of the season.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to stay here but I'm a professional and I must choose what is best for me. Circumstances could make me go,&quot; said Ronaldo whose representatives are pushing Barcelona further improvements to an already lucrative contract.</p>
<p>Ronaldo, signed from Dutch side PSV Eindhoven for a then world-record fee of $17.4 million in the close season, said he felt he had a right to negotiate with other clubs.</p>
<p>Juventus and Milan, the two wealthiest clubs in Italy, have reportedly balked at the cost of bringing Ronaldo to Italy but Lazio, who last won the Italian league in 1974, seem more open to the idea.</p>
<p>&quot;April will be the decisive month,&quot; said Cragnotti whose holding company Cirio, a well-known food processor, has business interests in Brazil.</p>
<p>And, while Cragnotti wants to continue the off-field club-building by listing for the club on the bourse, club president Dino Zoff is determined to relive the glory days on the field.</p>
<p>Zoff is acting coach at the moment after the dismissal of the Czech Zdenek Zeman.</p>
<p>However, for next season they appear to have lured Sampdoria's Swedish coach Sven-Goran Eriksson from under the nose of English club Blackburn Rovers and perhaps they will now steal Ronaldo away from Barcelona.</p>
