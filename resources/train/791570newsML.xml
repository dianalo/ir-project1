<title>USA: CBOT'S ARBOR BLASTS CFTC ON DELAYS, TRADE OPTIONS.</title>
<headline>CBOT'S ARBOR BLASTS CFTC ON DELAYS, TRADE OPTIONS.</headline>
<dateline>GALENA, Ill. 1997-08-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Chicago Board of Trade Chairman Patrick Arbor on Monday attacked the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) for &quot;meddling&quot; and &quot;waffling&quot; on key issues affecting CBOT operations.</p>
<p>In remarks prepared for delivery to the GROWMARK Summer Grain Conference here, Arbor stepped up the exchange's recent sharp criticism of the regulatory agency for delays in approving a new delivery plan for its corn and soybean contracts.</p>
<p>Arbor also attacked the CFTC's push to make changes in the delivery terms of the CBOT's wheat contract and the CFTC's possible approval of off-exchange ag trade options.</p>
<p>&quot;The CFTC is holding our grain markets hostage,&quot; he said. &quot;Our 1999 corn and soybean contracts include the proposed delivery terms, but market users tell us they are hesitant to use them because of regulatory waffling by the CFTC.&quot;</p>
<p>The CFTC, citing concerns about shrinking elevator capacity in the Chicago area, in December ordered the CBOT to come up with a new delivery system for corn and soybeans within 75 days. The exchange submitted a plan on April 16.</p>
<p>But the plan, which drops Toledo and St Louis as delivery points in favor of elevator locations along the northern Illinois River, prompted a wave of criticsm from some grain industry players and from local Ohio politicians.</p>
<p>&quot;Today is August 11 -- 160 days after the urgent deadline. And the CFTC recently indicated it might take more than 180 days -- a full six months -- to make a decision,&quot; Arbor said.</p>
<p>Arbor said he spoke to CFTC chairperson Brooksley Born last week about the plan and Born said there was no timetable.</p>
<p>&quot;She said her agency has concerns. I said the agency has political pressures and I suggested she should do what is right for the market,&quot; Arbor said.</p>
<p>Arbor said that the CFTC, meanwhile, continued to push for unspecified changes in the CBOT's wheat contract. Last month it asked the grain industry for public comments on the contract.</p>
<p>&quot;While the Freedom to Farm Act took the government out of farming, it did not take the government out of agriculture. The CFTC continues to meddle in the stable markets that support U.S. agribusiness,&quot; Arbor said.</p>
<p>Arbor also said the CFTC's plans to lift a longstanding ban on off-exchange &quot;ag trade options&quot; was wrong-headed. Born said on July 23 that she favored a three-year pilot program to see how the industry would use the options.</p>
<p>Ag trade options are party-to-party agreements that allow farmers to pay a premium to an elevator or other commercial firm for the right to sell grain at a particular price.</p>
<p>Arbor said hedging products need market integrity and proven oversight which off-exchange ag trade options lacked.</p>
<p>&quot;The result could be a sequel to the hedge-to-arrive (HTA) horror show the industry experienced only last year,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Many farmers defaulted on off-exchange HTA contracts when cash corn prices soared to record levels last spring, selling their corn and &quot;rolling over&quot; their HTA delivery obligations.</p>
<p>That prompted a swath of lawsuits and incriminations across the Corn Belt about the terms and enforcement of HTA contracts.</p>
