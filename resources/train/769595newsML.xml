<title>USA: New trial ordered for Detroit cop in motorist death.</title>
<headline>New trial ordered for Detroit cop in motorist death.</headline>

<p>The Michigan State Supreme Court ordered a new trial Thursday for one of two white policemen convicted of second-degree murder in the 1992 beating death of a black motorist.</p>
<p>The court ruled that the conviction of Walter Budzyn should be overturned, but it upheld the conviction of Larry Nevers. The two white policemen were convicted of clubbing Malice Green, who was black, to death Nov. 5, 1992, with heavy flashlights.</p>
<p>Budzyn and Nevers had argued their convictions should be overturned because the Recorder's Court jury selection was flawed, the jury was biased, there was excessive pre-trial publicity and insufficient evidence.</p>
<p>In its ruling, the Michigan high court said the juries for both defendants were exposed to &quot;extrinsic influences&quot; that created a &quot;real and substantial possibility of prejudice&quot; and deprived them of their constitutional right to a fair trial.</p>
<p>But the court stopped short of overturning Nevers' convictions because of &quot;the overwhelming evidence of his guilt,&quot; it said in a summary of its decision.</p>
<p>The case and 12-week trial came shortly after the Rodney King videotaped beating by police in Los Angeles and deeply divided Detroit on along racial lines.</p>
