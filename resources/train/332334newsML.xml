<p>A possible credit rating upgrade for the Philippines by Moody's Investors Services is expected to open the doors of the international capital market for more domestic corporate borrowers, bond underwriters said on Friday.</p>
<p>Moody's earlier announced that it had placed the Philippines' foreign currency sovereign ceiling for bonds and notes on review for possible upgrade from the present Ba2 rating.</p>
<p>A Ba2 rating is two notches below investment grade.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect to see more maiden issuers, first timers going to the market with big issues,&quot; said Consuelo Garcia, head of investment banking at ING Bank's Manila branch. ING Bank is one of the top bond underwriters for Philippine companies.</p>
<p>Andrew Alcid, director of Citicorp International Ltd, agreed, saying that more corporations would be encouraged to borrow abroad, especially if the United States Treasury rates remained at their current low levels.</p>
<p>Institutional investors had already priced Philippine bonds as if they were investment grade issues, both investment bankers said.</p>
<p>They cited the case of the Republic of the Philippines Eurobond, whose spread against U.S. Treasury had narrowed to the same spread as Poland's Eurobond, which is an investment grade debt paper.</p>
<p>Bids for the 20-year Philippines Eurobonds went up to 103 1/4 from 102 3/4 on Thursday immediately after the announcement, but it had pulled back to 102 7/8 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>&quot;It's just a knee-jerk reaction. The upgrade has been expected by the market for a long time already. The surprise element here is that the bond prices reacted to this,&quot; Citicorp's Alcid said.</p>
<p>Garcia added that she expected blue-chip borrowers to diversify their borrowings into other currencies than the dollar and the yen since they would get better deals through bigger issues, longer maturities or lower interest charges.</p>
<p>&quot;I expect more multi-currency issues for Philippines borrowers. Why not a deutsche mark bond? Why not a guilder bond?&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Philippine corporations have been actively tapping the international bond market because they were being favoured with tighter spreads. Since 1993, local corporate borrowers have issued more than $4 billion worth of dollar-denominated notes and bonds.</p>
<p>Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo told Reuters he expected more investors to relocate to the country due to the positive news.</p>
<p>&quot;I am glad this signal is early in 1997 as it will further consolidate international perceptions of the Philippines as the primary investment destination of choice,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Moody's said the review was prompted by the successful macroeconomic policies implemented by the Philippine government in recent years, in particular the substantial effort made to increase tax collections.</p>
