<p>Inter Milan president Massimo Moratti was quoted on Wednesday as saying that he was &quot;fatalistic&quot; about the chances of Brazilian Ronaldo joining his club and doubted that he would be arriving.</p>
<p>Moratti confirmed that Inter had made an offer for Barcelona's star striker and was waiting to see what happened.</p>
<p>&quot;I am waiting here for events to happen. With fatalism. Because its clear that if he breaks (with Barcelona) it will be the player who chooses his team,&quot; Moratti said in an interview with the Gazzetta dello Sport newspaper.</p>
<p>Rome club Lazio have been chasing Ronaldo for months along with several other clubs in Europe and Brazil, although the total deal to bring him from Barcelona could cost an astonishing 50 million pounds ($82.7 million).</p>
<p>Moratti said Inter had put their hat in the ring because Ronaldo was a great player.</p>
<p>&quot;If you want my impressions, I don't think that Ronaldo will choose Inter in the end,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>He pointed out that top class players did not have to cost the earth by mentioning that Inter had bought Nigerian Nwankwo Kanu, who has not played for the club since a heart problem was diagnosed, for far less than Ronaldo would cost.</p>
<p>Moratti said Kanu was an &quot;extraordinary talent&quot; who could have proved just as sensational.</p>
<p>He told the newspaper that he would dearly love to sign Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta but that was looking impossible because Fiorentina refused to let him go.</p>
<p>Asked whether it would become possible if the player broke with Fiorentina, he replied:</p>
<p>&quot;You have to understand the kind of price involved. At the figures going around recently ($24 million) I think it would be an impossible operation.&quot;</p>
<p>Moratti said the club did not want to modify its current squad much. New coach Luigi Simoni had made few particular requests and was bringing Brazilians Andre Cruz and Caio with him from Napoli when he starts next season.</p>
<p>Chilean striker Ivan Zamorano would be staying.</p>
<p>&quot;Then much depends on Ince, who is in a state of deep uncertainty,&quot; said Moratti of his unsettled English international midfielder. &quot;Paul knows that by staying he would be giving me an exceptional present.&quot;</p>
