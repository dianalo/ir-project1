<p>France will put their capacity both for hosting and winning the 1998 World Cup finals to the test in the four-team Tournoi de France, also involving Brazil, Italy and England, which starts on Tuesday.</p>
<p>France put their playing credentials to the test in the opening match against World Cup holders Brazil at Lyon's Gerland stadium, with both teams expected to be at full strength. Off the pitch, Michel Platini's organisers and the security organisation will be putting their own arrangements for the World Cup finals, which have been expanded to 32 teams, into practice for the first time.</p>
<p>French coach Aime Jacquet and his Brazilian counterpart Mario Zagalo, whose teams have not been involved in qualifying games, need competitive matches to assess the true state of their sides.</p>
<p>Brazil's shock 4-2 defeat by Norway in Oslo on Friday will have sent alarm bells ringing round the Brazilian camp.</p>
<p>Zagalo must send his team out to prove that England manager Glenn Hoddle, speaking to France Football magazine, was correct when he said: &quot;Brazil and France are at present definitely the strongest in the world.</p>
<p>&quot;In the Tournoi de France the two countries will line up their best players, they'll be 100 percent for slightly different reasons -- France thanks to their individual stars and popular support, Brazil because they are the most balanced team,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Jacquet, however, is unhappy that he has to wait until 48 hours before kick-off for a number of his foreign-based players involved in league action this weekend to arrive.</p>
<p>&quot;This tournament is something exceptional and as one only rarely gets the chance to play against Brazil, we wanted to try something interesting. We won't be able to,&quot; he said at France's retreat south of Paris.</p>
<p>&quot;I wanted to carry out attacking combinations but we're going to have to take into account the state of fatigue of those arriving on Sunday (night) and that changes everything.&quot;</p>
<p>England and Italy, who meet in Nantes on Wednesday, would have preferred the tournament to be held later in the year.</p>
<p>A long, hard season that included a high-profile World Cup qualifier between the two countries which Italy won 1-0 at Wembley in February, has taken its toll on their players and the squads arrive in France with notable absentees.</p>
<p>Both countries plan to use the tournament to experiment but they will not be want to give too much away as they are due to clash again in the return qualifier in Rome in October -- a match which looks certain to decide top place in the group following England's 2-0 victory over Poland in Chorzow on Saturday.</p>
<p>World governing body FIFA said last week it was pleased with the way France was handling its preparations, although the issue of perimeter fencing, which the French government wants to retain for the finals, was still a cause for concern.</p>
<p>France would have liked Lens, the soccer-crazy industrial town in the north-east near the Belgian border, to have been ready for the Tournoi de France. But delays to alterations of the Felix Bollaert stadium for the World Cup finals and allegations of corruption among officials meant the city had to withdraw.</p>
<p>Brazil's match against England on June 10 -- a year to the day before the World Cup finals start -- has been switched from Lens to Paris, where the tournament ends the following day when France meet Italy. Both matches are at the Parc des Princes.</p>
<p>Montpellier, in the far south, hosts France's other match, against England on Saturday June 7. Brazil play in Lyon twice, meeting Italy in a repeat of the 1994 World Cup final at Gerland the next day.</p>
