<p>The Indian rupee ended down at 35.72/73 against the dollar on Friday after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervened in the spot market, dealers said.</p>
<p>The rupee opened the day almost unchanged at 35.70/71 against the dollar.</p>
<p>&quot;There was some welcome volatility today,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>He said RBI's purchases came on the top of moderate corporate dollar demand. &quot;RBI bought upto 35.7250,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Three European banks were in the market buying dollars for the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corp, dealers said. Officials at the firm were not available for comment.</p>
<p>&quot;There were deals upto 35.73 today,&quot; a dealer said.</p>
<p>The forward premiums opened slightly down, but held their ground later on profit-booking, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;There was also apprehension RBI may step in anytime though it didn't happen,&quot; said a dealer.</p>
<p>&quot;The February dollar premiums fell by almost 18 paise in the last two days,&quot; said the chief dealer at a leading bank.</p>
<p>The six month annualised forward premium closed the day at 4.31 percent compared to the previous close of 4.59 percent.</p>
