<p>China's securities authorities have decided to flood the country's volatile share markets with new issues next year to soak up excess funds which make trading so speculative, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The massive issues were likely to continue to attract local investors in spite of comments by Beijing on Monday morning which caused a two-day market crash, the analysts said.</p>
<p>The People's Daily said China's stock markets were overheated and warned that if there were a crash, Beijing would not step in to help investors.</p>
<p>Stocks immediately plummeted on both the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges, although they staged what some brokers called a technical rebound on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Securities authorities on Sunday announced an annual share quota of billion yuan ($1.2 billion), nearly double the 5.5 billion yuan approved last year.</p>
<p>China has used a system of annual share quotas since its two stock markets were founded in 1990. Part of a year's quota can be held over for issue later depending on market conditions.</p>
<p>The announcement was obviously one of the measures timed to offset the market panic which set in on the publication of the People's Daily editorial, analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;The new quota is a record of China's stock markets,&quot; said one analyst. &quot;The central government seems more determined than ever to use new shares to absorb funds to curb speculation in line with the current crackdown on the markets.&quot;</p>
<p>The expected 1997 issues will increase the number of shares on the two stock exchanges by almost a third. Tradeable shares on the markets at the end of November totalled 25.6 billion domestic A shares and 7.58 billion foreign currency B shares.</p>
<p>The issues would succeed, despite the risks of the primary share market, thanks to the huge and growing individual savings deposits in China's banks and a lack of alternative investment channels, the analysts said.</p>
<p>&quot;Market conditions will be the key to the success of the new issues,&quot; said an executive with a major Chinese brokerage.</p>
<p>&quot;The new shares will still be hot sellers next year as long as the central government gradually reduces its administrative interference and uses more market means to regulate trading,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Markets sources expect the trend in new issues next year to focus on large issues of larger companies which will make it more difficult for speculators to repeat the huge profits they have made on many primary issues in recent years.</p>
<p>&quot;Risks on the primary market will rise if big firms with large issues are introduced,&quot; said a second analyst. &quot;But this suits to Beijing's policy of cooling down the markets.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Despite the expected new trend, new shares will still attract retail investors,&quot; said another analyst. &quot;Liquidity will not be a problem at all. Individual bank deposits are rising fast and the channels of investment available are very limited.&quot;</p>
<p>Speculation on the futures markets has been rigorously suppressed, and the real estate market, another popular avenue for &quot;hot money&quot;, has been in a slump for more than a year.</p>
<p>Treasury bills and bonds issued to the public have hit record high volumes for three successive years with an issue of 195.2 billion yuan this year alone. But the quantity was still tiny compared to the rocketing bank deposits, analysts said. ($1 = 8.3 yuan)</p>
