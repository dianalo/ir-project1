<p>An official Israeli inquiry into the crash of two military helicopters earlier this month said on Friday it had so far failed to find the reason for the accident that killed 73 soldiers.</p>
<p>&quot;The commission cannot as yet identify the cause of the accident,&quot; Israel radio quoted an interim report as saying.</p>
<p>The defence minister ordered the inquiry immediately after the crash on February 4 of two Sikorsky CH-53s over northern Israel on their way to south Lebanon. All 73 soldiers and officers on board were killed. Nobody on the ground was hurt.</p>
<p>The commission headed by former air force head David Ivri made a number of recommendations for changes in procedures for flights ferrying troops into Israel's south Lebanon occupation strip.</p>
<p>Israeli army chiefs presented the interim report at a Tel Aviv press conference carried live on all Israeli television and radio stations.</p>
<p>The report ruled out the stormy weather at the time of the crash as its cause. It also said it was unlikely arteriosclerosis discovered in one of the pilots in an autopsy was related to the accident.</p>
<p>It recommended helicopters fly separately instead of in formation to reduce the risk of crashing and increase the freedom of pilots to make quick decisions. It said the policy of extinquishing the aircraft lights when crossing the border should be reexamined.</p>
<p>Air Force Commander Major-General Eitan Ben-Eliahu said the recommendation to change procedures did not mean the old procedures were at fault for the accident, but that flights could be made safer.</p>
<p>&quot;We completely adopt these recommendations,&quot; he said. &quot;They will allow us to continue flying as safely as possible even while the final findings are being sought.&quot;</p>
<p>Asked whether the cause of the crash might never be known at all, Ben-Eliahu said: &quot;Everything, but everything, is possible.&quot;</p>
