<p>New Zealand extended their overall lead to 184 runs at lunch on the third day of the second cricket test against Sri Lanka on Sunday.</p>
<p>The home side, who dismissed the tourists for 170 on Saturday to earn a first innings lead of 52 runs, were 132 for three at the lunch break in their second innings.</p>
<p>New Zealand resumed on 53 for one in the morning but lost Matt Horne in the seventh over of the session. Offspinner Muttiah Muralitharan deceived him in the air and off the track, presenting wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana with a straight forward stumping.</p>
<p>Horne made 16 and his wicket was Muralitharan's 99th in the test arena.</p>
<p>Opening batsman Bryan Young, who started on 22 in the morning, looked set to dominate as he went on to his 11th test half-century before being dismissed for 62.</p>
<p>Young, who had hit eight fours and one six -- over mid-wicket against offspinner Kumar Dharmasena -- was caught at short mid-wicket by Arjuna Ranatunga off Dharmasena.</p>
<p>At the crease are skipper Stephen Fleming on 22 and Nathan Astle on nine.</p>
