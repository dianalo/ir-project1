<p>Dutch paper group Koninklijke KNP BT will probably use proceeds of the sale of its plastic packaging unit to Tenneco of the U.S. to expand in central and eastern Europe, sector analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>&quot;I think that they will use the proceeds to expand their corrugated board activities where a considerable return can be realised,&quot; said Jan Wirken of financial research institute IRIS.</p>
<p>He said the planned sale, announced earlier today, would enable KNP BT to take a major step towards expanding its core activities, particularly in eastern Europe, and create added value for the company.</p>
<p>Wirken said he expected KNP BT would receive about 500 million guilders for its Flexible &amp; Protective Packagings unit which has annual turnover of about one billion guilders.</p>
<p>He estimated the invested capital of the unit at about 700 million guilders but said it also had interest bearing debts of 200 million.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not expect them to make a substantial book profit or loss on the sale,&quot; Wirken said.</p>
<p>KNP BT spokesman Patrick de Leede declined to comment on analysts' estimates of the selling price, which ranged from 400 to 500 million guilders.  </p>
<p>He said the deal was not expected to be concluded until late February or early March, so KNP BT could not disclose a takeover price until then.</p>
<p>De Leede said some parts of the unit, those which make flexible packagings, were not profitable last year but that the vast majority of the protective packagings units were.</p>
<p>IRIS's Wirken said the unit as a whole was profitable although some parts were in the red.</p>
<p>&quot;It certainly is not a bad company, but it is not a core activity,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>Robert-Jan Stassen of Bangert Pontier said the sale of the flexible and protective packagings unit was a good move as plastic packagings were not really one of KNP BT's strengths.</p>
<p>&quot;It would be better to keep the proceeds within the packagings division so that the money could be used, as the company itself has indicated before, to expand in eastern Europe,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>KNP BT has already made its first steps in that direction, with investments in the Czech Republic and Poland.</p>
<p>IRIS's Wirken said the planned sale had not changed his opinion of KNP BT's shares but added his firm had raised the shares to Hold from Sell just before today's announcement.</p>
<p>IRIS expects KNP BT to post higher sales and profits in 1997 after a disappointing 1996. It believes the worst is over for the paper division and that packagings will make higher operating profits this year.</p>
<p>KNP BT's distribution division is expected to be a relatively constant growth factor in group turnover and operating profits, IRIS said.</p>
