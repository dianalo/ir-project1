<p>Strawberries and cream, Pimms and ... queuing.</p>
<p>It was business as usual on Monday for the start of the 111th Wimbledon championships -- a familiar line weaved its way around the streets and parks of the leafy London suburb.</p>
<p>But the British, like no other nationality, are patient and Frances Burgess, 37, of Oxford, is this year's champion after a marathon 66-hour wait.</p>
<p>She pitched her igloo tent on the footpath at the main entrance to the courts at 8pm on Friday to ensure she could get a seat for the opening of court one at 1.30pm on Monday.</p>
<p>By the time local favourite Tim Henman and Canada's Daniel Nestor inaugurated the court, she had endured numerous thunderstorms, but the long vigil was worth it.</p>
<p>&quot;This is my 12th year I've lined-up here, but usually I'd only come on the Saturday,&quot; said Burgess, a groom on a thoroughbred stud farm. &quot;But I wanted to make sure I could get tickets for court one -- you could call me a tennis addict.&quot;</p>
<p>By midday on Saturday, the footpath resembled a camping ground with 20 tents lined up and by the early hours of Monday the number of people had swelled to thousands.</p>
<p>That meant hundreds missed out as there were only 500 unreserved seats in the new 11,000-seat number one court.</p>
