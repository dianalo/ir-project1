<title>USA: Juror dismissed in Simpson civil trial.</title>
<headline>Juror dismissed in Simpson civil trial.</headline>
<dateline>SANTA MONICA, Calif 1997-01-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>The judge in the O.J. Simpson civil trial dismissed the only black member of the jury Friday and ordered them to begin their deliberations from scratch as investigators looked into allegations of jury tampering.</p>
<p>Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki gave no explanation for the juror's removal after three days of deliberations, except to say it was for &quot;legal cause.&quot;</p>
<p>But a source involved in the trial said it had nothing to do with the claims of jury tampering that have swirled around the case this week.</p>
<p>The source said the dismissed juror, a woman in her 60s, was removed at the request of Simpson's attorneys. She was replaced with an Asian-American man in his 30s.</p>
<p>Simpson, who was acquitted in October 1995 in the murders of his ex-wife and her friend, is now battling a wrongful-death civil lawsuit brought by the victims' families, who are seeking substantial monetary damages.</p>
<p>&quot;A juror has been excused for legal cause,&quot; Fujisaki said at a hastily called court hearing after meeting with attorneys for both sides in his chambers.</p>
<p>The decision came in the midst of an investigation ordered by Fujisaki after two of the civil trial jurors told him they had received a letter signed by two panellists from Simpson's criminal trial.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs' attorneys, apparently out of concern over the jury tampering allegations, asked Fujisaki on Friday to sequester the jury for the remainder of their deliberations, but the judge refused, the source said.</p>
<p>In a brief court session, Fujisaki told jurors they would have to start all over again, saying it was the only way to ensure a fair and impartial verdict.</p>
<p>&quot;This right may be assured in this case if the jurors begin deliberating again from the beginning. You are to put all previous deliberations aside and begin anew,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Meeting behind closed doors in a cramped, windowless room, jurors have given little indication of how far they have progressed and where they are heading in their discussions.</p>
<p>The jury is now made up of nine whites, one Hispanic, one Asian-American and one person of mixed black and Asian descent. The panel that acquitted Simpson in his criminal trial was mostly black.</p>
