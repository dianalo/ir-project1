<p>Chilean blue chips powered ahead on strong foreign buying and Wall Street's gains, smashing past the 110-point psychological barrier and pushing the bolsa's New Year's rally to new heights.</p>
<p>The selective IPSA index closed 1.97 percent higher to end at 110.96 points, with a few high-volume stocks posting hefty rises.</p>
<p>The general IGPA rose 1.16 points to 5224.89 on volume of 12.9 billion pesos, stronger than Monday's paltry level, but still relatively weak.  </p>
<p>Expectations of a cut in local interest rates continued to animate the market, but the main factors were heavy buying by foreign institutional investors and confidence in the U.S. economy after a benign report on December inflation eased fears of a Fed rate rise, brokers said.</p>
<p>Risers included Madeco, up 5.5 percent to 1,150 pesos, after it boasted of a big increase in revenues expected this year.</p>
<p>Santa Isabel gained 7.3 percent to 735 pesos, leading the supermarket chain to issue a statement saying it knows of &quot;no particular reason for today's increase.&quot;  </p>
<p>But analysts at BICE brokerage issued a report forecasting a 30.6 percent jump in Santa Isabel's earnings this year over last.</p>
<p>The same report forecast strong gains in the Chilean banking sector's earnings and declines in the power generation and distribution industries, coinciding with many analysts' comments seeing a tough year for the power sector.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, electricals have been among the strongest gainers in the rally. Endesa closed up 2.7 percent for the day to 246.50 pesos and Edelnor rose 6.3 percent to 170.11 pesos.  </p>
<p>Maderas y Sintticos, or Masisa, was up 4.7 percent to 222 pesos, and Cristaleras was up 3.6 percent to 2720 pesos.</p>
<p>Brokers saw no sign of the rally ebbing. But one said the lack of local news to move the market, with much of the country on summer holidays, meant the market was even more swayed than usual by events abroad.</p>
<p>The day's handful of decliners included Infodema, off 2.2 percent to 18 pesos and Oro Blanco, down 1.9 percent to 2.5 pesos.</p>
