<p>Irish government bonds firmed in active late trade on Thursday on the back of a very positive set of domestic news, including inflation data, dealers said.</p>
<p>&quot;We have seen over the last few days a very positive set of circumstances. First of all, we have had the punt moving to the top of the ERM grid which has led to a lot of foreign interest in the Irish market,&quot; said Padraic Garvey of Riada Stockbrokers.</p>
<p>&quot;All of this has led to a lot of convergence in Irish bonds over UK gilts and German bunds. We have had the icing on the cake today with the Irish CPI which was an excellent number. It has all been very positive,&quot; he added.  </p>
<p>Irish inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, showed a rise of 1.5 percent in the year to mid-August compared with 1.4 percent in the year to mid-May.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the third quarter inflation release appeared to confirm the view that inflationary pressures remain subdued for the present.</p>
<p>&quot;There is always a risk that the market might suffer a setback but we must be happy with the way things stand,&quot; said Garvey.  </p>
<p>By 1515 GMT, the 8.00 percent bond due 2000 had risen 35p from Wednesday's close to 104.45 to yield 6.60 percent while the 8.00 percent bond due 2006 had risen 45p from the close at 104.00 to yield 7.28 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said market focus was now likely to switch to the U.S. ahead of the release of August consumer prices and retail sales data on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;The market seems to be settling on a quarter-point rise in U.S. rates at this stage, but the CPI report tomorrow will tell us a bit more,&quot; said Garvey.</p>
