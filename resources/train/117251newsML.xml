<text>
<p>KCBT hard red winter wheat futures ended broadly lower on selling by locals and funds as the nearby contract failed to hold on at higher levels after piercing resistance, traders said.</p>
<p>Wheat firmed early on continued buying momentum from Monday's close. But KCBT Dec wheat was unable to hold on to its high above resistance at $4.45 per bushel and consequently tumbled. Sell stops were triggered at $4.38, which brought Dec down to its daily low at $4.34.</p>
<p>&quot;Obviously the market's inability to hold on above $4.45 proved fatal,&quot; a trader said.</p>
<p>KCBT wheat closed two to 6-1/2 cents lower, with Dec down 5-3/4 cents at $4.38-3/4.</p>
<p>Traders said Man International bull-spread 1.3 million Dec/March at 20 cents per bushel. Refco bull-spread 1.1 million Dec/March at 20 to 20-1/2 cents. CIS bought 1.4 million March bushels in the first part of the session but also sold 1.2 million Dec and 1.3 million March, sources said.</p>
<p>Rosenthal Collins, LFG and Chicago Corp each sold more than one million Dec bushels.</p>
<p>Traders noted that the spread between KCBT and CBOT Dec wheat continued to widen Tuesday and closed at 17 cents.</p>
