<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat on Thursday compared Israel's settlement building in Arab East Jerusalem to &quot;terrorism&quot; and said it threatened to plunge the Middle East into violence.</p>
<p>Arafat's statement in Gaza at the opening of the second work year of the Palestinian Legislative Council came as clashes flared at the outskirts of the West Bank town of Bethlehem between Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers.</p>
<p>Addressing the 88-member council, Arafat accused Israel of &quot;arrogance&quot; by sidelining peace deals, ignoring the international will, and going ahead with construction at Jabal Abu Ghneim, which Israelis call Har Homa.</p>
<p>&quot;The continuation of this irresponsible Israeli position threatens to destroy and undermine the whole peace process and endangers order and security in the region and returns it to the cycle of violence and destruction,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>&quot;It (Israel) must realise that settlements, like terrorism, do not go along with a just and lasting peace,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Arafat vowed he would not compromise on the fate of East Jerusalem, which the PLO wants to be the capital of a future Palestinian state.</p>
<p>&quot;Regarding Jerusalem, the Israeli government must realise that this issue is not subject to compromise and that it is a Palestinian and an Arab and a Moslem and a Christian red line,&quot; Arafat said.</p>
<p>&quot;There will be no peace and no stability in the region without the return of Jerusalem to be the capital of the Palestinian state,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Arafat later left Gaza for Cairo where he is to meet Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>While the council met, Israeli soldiers guarding a Jewish shrine at the outskirts of PLO-ruled Bethlehem fired tear gas at hundreds of Palestinian university students who broke through Palestinian police lines and pelted them with stones.</p>
<p>The students had been on a march protesting the construction of the 6,500-home settlement not far from Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Palestinian hospital officials said 13 Palestinians were overcome by tear gas and one was wounded by a rubber bullet. Witnesses said at least one Israeli soldier was hurt by a stone.</p>
<p>Similar clashes that erupted in the West Bank and Gaza last September after Israel opened a tourist tunnel near Moslem holy shrines in Jerusalem evolved into gunbattles between the two sides security forces in which 61 Palestinians and 15 Israeli soldiers were killed.</p>
<p>Israel regards East Jerusalem which it captured from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war as part of its &quot;eternal&quot; capital.</p>
<p>The fate of Jerusalem is one of several issues which Israel and the PLO had agreed to negotiate in talks on a permanent peace deal.</p>
<p>The talks, officially launched last year, were due to resume on March 17 but did not amidst the crisis over the new Jewish settlement.</p>
