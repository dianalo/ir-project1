<title>FRANCE: French Socialists eye life insurance tax.</title>

<p>French Socialist Martine Aubry said in an interview to be published this weekend that her party's plan to raise 40 billion francs more in tax on capital-generated income principally concerned life assurance revenues.</p>
<p>Aubry, an ex-labour minister and daughter of former European Commission president Jacques Delors, was spelling out opposition Socialist party tax policy ahead of the parliamentary election in an interview to be published in magazine Valeurs Actuelles.</p>
<p>&quot;It's true, life assurance is the biggest part,&quot; Aubry said in response to a question about Socialist plans to raise 40 billion in tax on revenues from capital.</p>
<p>Aubry said that existing life assurance contracts would not be affected. &quot;But the insurers themselves know all too well that they have to think about this and that the existing, exorbitant situation will not continue,&quot; Aubry added.</p>
<p>She reiterated that Socialist policy was not to increase the overall tax burden, but to &quot;rebalance&quot; it, with the emphasis on boosting purchasing power through a cut in indirect value added tax (VAT) and adjustments in social security charges on the one hand and more tax on capital income on the other.</p>
<p>Income tax cuts by Prime Minister Alain Juppe's centre-right government -- the 1996 budget programmes income tax cuts of 75 billion francs over five years with the first 25 billion this year -- was unfairly skewed to high salary earners, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;VAT must be cut on basic goods, while the government has done the reverse,&quot; she said, referring to a 1995 rise of two percentage points in VAT to 20.6 percent.</p>
<p>&quot;Juppe constrained purchasing power instead of increasing it. The (income) tax cuts are far less significant for those in lower tax brackets than those in the upper levels,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>&quot;For example, a single person earning 6,000 francs a month will see his income tax bill fall by 220 francs a year, while a single person earning 80,000 francs a month will see his income tax fall 22,000 francs: he earns 15 times as much but he gets a tax cut 100 times bigger.&quot;</p>
<p>Life assurance contracts have been a highly popular product in France as a way of putting money aside with a large capital payout at the end of eight years and advantageous tax terms.</p>
<p>The opposition Socialist party accuses Juppe's government of strangling purchasing power and therefore the demand stimulus for economic growth through a centre-right policy which has seen VAT increased and the brakes put on public spending.</p>
