<title>CANADA: Imperial Oil Q1 profit down after '96 gain.</title>
<headline>Imperial Oil Q1 profit down after '96 gain.</headline>

<p>Imperial Oil Ltd. -- Canada's biggest energy company -- Friday reported lower first-quarter net earnings vs. a year earlier when it posted a major gain from a tax refund.</p>
<p>Excluding the 1996 gain, Imperial's per share profit in this year's first quarter rose by 53 percent, driven by strong oil and natural gas prices, increased crude production and a major reduction in shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Toronto-based Imperial, 69.6 percent-owned by U.S.-based Exxon Corp. said earnings in the first quarter were C$191 million ($138 million) or C$1.21 (87 cents) a share, down from C$374 million ($269 million) or C$1.99 ($1.43) a share in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Without the gain of C$250 million ($180 million), earnings in last year's first quarter would have been C$149 million ($107 million) or C79 cents (57 cents) a share.</p>
<p>Imperial is Canada's largest producer of oil and natural gas and operates the country's most extensive refining and service station network under the Esso banner.</p>
<p>&quot;The company had a strong first quarter,&quot; Imperial Chief Executive Bob Peterson said in a statement. &quot;Crude oil prices and volumes were up and downstream markets continued to improve.&quot;</p>
<p>The company said crude oil production rose to 271,000 barrels a day from 255,000 in the same period last year with much of the increase coming from its expanding Cold Lake heavy oil project in northeast Alberta.</p>
<p>Its strong average price for crude oil sales in the first quarter of 1997 also helped earnings. Imperial fetched an average C$26.76 ($19.27) a barrel, up from C$23.31 ($16.78) last year, it said.</p>
<p>Natural gas sales dropped to 376 million cubic feet a day from 437 million in 1996.</p>
<p>Last year, Imperial bought back C$1.4 billion ($1 billion) of its shares in a tender auction, which helped to bolster earnings per share and drained what was once a huge cash reserve, the company said.</p>
