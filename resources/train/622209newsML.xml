<headline>Japan high-techs encouraged by Nasdaq rally.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-05-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in Japan's high technology sector strengthened in morning trade on Wednesday, heartened by the overnight rally by high techs in New York, brokers said.</p>
<p>Fujitsu Ltd added 10 yen to stand at 1,390. Fujitsu was the fourth most heavily traded issue on the Tokyo bourse with 2.57 million shares traded by midday.</p>
<p>Tokyo Electron Ltd hit a high for the calendar year before retracing to 5,150 yen, up 100.</p>
<p>&quot;The outlook for the firm's business is not exceptionally strong, but investors think there is room for growth as the outlook for chip makers is improving,&quot; a broker at a medium-sized brokerage said.</p>
<p>NEC Corp also rose, adding 20 yen to 1,610.  </p>
<p>&quot;The jump in Nasdaq came at a time when trade in incentive-backed issues, which had been supporting the market in recent sessions was beginning to wane in Tokyo,&quot; said Harushige Kobayashi, deputy general manager at Yamaichi Securities.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Nasdaq finished up 19, or 1.4 percent, at 1,409, crossing the 1,400 threshold for the first time.</p>
<p>Brokers added that investors were also steered to high-tech issues due to healthy earnings forecasts for some of the firms announced recently.</p>
<p>One such share was Pioneer Electronic Corp, which gained 140 to 2,720 yen at midday, a new high for the calendar year.</p>
<p>&quot;Until now, the shares were considered to be a loser,&quot; a &quot;Big Four&quot; broker said. &quot;However, the firm is expected to come back into black in the year ended March 1998 and investors are appreciating the forecast.&quot;</p>
<p>Pioneer said last week that it expected a parent current profit of 4.8 billion yen in fiscal 1997/98, compared to a loss of 4.10 billion yen the previous year.</p>
