<p>U.N. diplomats camped out over the entire weekend in a bizarre lineup to reserve speaker slots for presidents and prime ministers addressing an environmental Earth Summit in June.</p>
<p>&quot;Everyone wanted to speak on the first day,&quot; said Italy's ambassador Paolo Fulci, whose country secured the 12th place slot. He said the system was highly unfair to smaller missions without enough staff to hold a place in line.</p>
<p>General Assembly president Razali Ismail of Malaysia originally wanted to draw lots among the 185 countries, his spokeswoman said. But after objections a first-come-first-serve system was instituted.</p>
<p>So at 4:30 p.m. on Friday, Brazil, Canada, Japan and Malaysia began to stand in line on the 36th floor of United Nations headquarters to await the Monday morning opening of the registration. Other missions joined the weekend marathon, camping out on hardback chairs.</p>
<p>Britain reported that Sir John Weston, its chief delegate, relieved Vicky Harris, its environmental expert and a mother of three, shortly after midnight on Saturday and stayed for several hours.</p>
<p>The United States divided its staff into three-hour shifts and ended up in 10th place to get a slot for President Bill Clinton or Vice President Al Gore. &quot;We would have gotten there sooner but we could not have imagined that the line would have started on Friday,&quot; a U.S. official said.</p>
<p>On Monday morning, registration for speakers moved quickly and by noon 114 delegations had submitted their names for the Earth Summit marking the fifth anniversary of a landmark environmental summit in Rio de Janiero.</p>
<p>The conference, called as a special session of the General Assembly, is scheduled for June 23-27 in New York and is expected to be attended by about 80 world leaders.</p>
<p>Despite Razali's efforts to be fair in handing out speaking arrangements, diplomats complainted loudly. &quot;This is a ridiculous system,&quot; said one envoy who asked not to be identified. &quot;There must have been a better way of doing it.&quot;</p>
