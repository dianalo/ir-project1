<headline>Dow backs off closing highs, Nasdaq down and mixed.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Wall Street shares trended lower shortly after the market open on Wednesday, lacking impetus after a rally in the technology sector pushed them to record levels on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Dow industrial average was down around 32 points or 0.44 percent at 7351, with declining issues outnumbering advancing issues by 10 to seven.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index, which pushed above the 1400-point level for the first time on Tuesday, was off around five points at 1404 in mixed trading.  </p>
<p>&quot;It's a lackluster market,&quot; one trader said. &quot;It has no conviction either way.&quot;</p>
<p>Technology stocks again led the list of active stocks, but while some networking stocks and International Business Machine Corp rose, a drop in stocks like Intel Corp and Microsoft Corp pulled the broader index lower. Microsoft was off 3/4 at 125-7/8, Intel was off one at 168-5/16 and IBM was up 1-1/4 at 90-5/8 on a post-split basis.</p>
<p>Intel said it filed a suit against Digital Equipment Corp alleging the company refused to return confidential information.  Digital was trading off 5/8 at 36-1/4.</p>
