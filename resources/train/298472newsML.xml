<headline>Dow Corning creditor groups agree on plan.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dow Corning Corp's two major creditor groups said Friday they had reached agreement between themselves on a reorganization plan for the company that would allow it to emerge from bankruptcy within 12 months.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the two groups said it was unclear whether Dow Corning would accept the plan.</p>
<p>Dow Corning, a 50-50 joint venture between Dow Chemical Co and Corning Inc, filed for bankruptcy in May 1995. It faces hundreds of millions of dollars of medical compensation claims involving its silicone gel breast implants.  </p>
<p>Dow Corning officials were not immediately available for comment on the agreement announced today.</p>
<p>The agreement was reached between the Commercial Creditors Committee, representing Dow Corning's financial and trade creditors, and the Tort Claimants Committee, representing individuals who have claimed injuries from the company's implants.</p>
<p>The two committees filed a motion with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Bay City, Mich., seeking permission to file a joint plan of reorganization for Dow Corning.  </p>
<p>Under the plan, the company would emerge from bankruptcy, pay its commercial debt, and make initial payments to implant recipients within the next 12 months, the two groups said.</p>
<p>The plan would allow the company to fully litigate the issue of breast implants and disease, they said.</p>
<p>The plan would have to be approved by the Bankruptcy Court.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a Dow Corning spokesman said the company believed it would take 12 to 18 months to emerge from bankrputcy. The spokesman was reacting to a published report that the company would emerge soon from bankruptcy court protection.  </p>
<p>Later, a Dow Corning spokeswoman, Barbara Muessig, said the company had not yet seen the creditors' plan.</p>
<p>However, she told Reuters the company still favored its own reorganization plan, which seeks to determine up front if breast implants cause disease.</p>
<p>&quot;We can't get through bankruptcy without resolving the issue of whether the breast implants led to disease,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>Dow Corning maintains the implants did not cause disease.</p>
