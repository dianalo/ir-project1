<p>Germany has entered a phase of stability with inflation under control, economic recovery broadly on track and the once over-valued mark trading at more reasonable levels, the Bundesbank said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The message came in the central bank's December monthly report, the last in a year which has seen Germany gradually emerge from a prolonged economic slow-down.</p>
<p>&quot;Germany has conclusively reached the goal of price stability. For the Bundesbank it is now a question of securing this success long-term,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>One small cloud on the inflation horizon was persistently strong growth in M3 money supply, a measure of German cash and short-term deposits and the Bundesbank's main policy indicator, but even that was expected to slow.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank also bemoaned the unevenness of Germany's economic upswing, pointing out that eastern states and firms focused on the home market were currently lagging behind their counterparts in the west and in export-driven sectors.</p>
<p>More investment and greater labour market flexibility was needed to boost the domestic economy, the central bank urged.</p>
<p>&quot;The normalisation of the growth process, a dying down of the building boom and increasing economic stability, presents new problems to the east German economy,&quot; the report said.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Bundesbank welcomed the realignment of currency markets of the past months, in particular the correction of the mark's exaggerated strength against the dollar -- perceived as a heavy burden on German exporters.</p>
<p>&quot;Unlike 1995, exchange rate levels now to a large degree correspond to economic fundamentals,&quot; the central bank said.</p>
<p>The central bank addressed Europe's planned single currency with its customary severity, urging German local and central governments to save more to avoid missing the budgetary criteria needed to take part in the 1999 Euro launch.</p>
<p>&quot;It is imperative to work on making sure that budgets are not exceeded ... The reduction of deficits is absolutely imperative in order to improve the framework for economic activity,&quot; the Bundesbank said.</p>
<p>The German central bank, one of Europe's greatest sticklers on currency union, also repeated the importance of maintaining fiscal stability once the Euro is launched.</p>
<p>Separately, its chief economist, Otmar Issing, told the Financial Times newspaper he was dissatisfied with the draft EMU stability pact agreed in Dublin, Ireland, last week, as it did not involve sufficiently automatic sanctions for fiscal offenders.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank did not give a clear interest rate outlook in its report but reaffirmed the importance of suppressing inflation and keeping a long-term stability goal.</p>
<p>The report condemned efforts to boost growth through monetary easing during periods of low inflation, saying such moves risked creating uncertainty and market turbulence.</p>
<p>Given current moderate economic conditions, the Bundesbank is widely expected to keep its two main interest rates, the discount and Lombard rate, unchanged at 2.50 percent and 4.50 percent respectively for the time being, although some leeway is seen on its money market rate, or repo.</p>
<p>Its policy-making council meets next on Thursday and is expected to reveal a fresh M3 target to replace its 1996 money supply goal of four to seven percent growth.</p>
<p>In its report, the Bundesbank conceded that M3 may overshoot that target by year-end after money supply growth remained at a robust 8.4 percent in October.</p>
<p>However it said special factors had boosted M3 -- such as high liquidity needs ahead of the Deutsche Telekom flotation in November and usually strong lending to the public sector.</p>
<p>&quot;As these influences recede, money supply growth should weaken again,&quot; the report concluded.</p>
