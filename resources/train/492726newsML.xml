<p>Russian-Belarussian monetary union is possible within two years but only if Belarus and Russia combine into a single federal state, Russian Central Bank chairman Sergein Dubinin said at the weekend.</p>
<p>Asked on Russian Television if monetary union were possible, without major problems, within two years, Dubinin said: &quot;Yes, that seems possible, but in the conditions of a united government and parliament and the solution of the problem of the presidency... You cannot have two presidents in one state.&quot;</p>
<p>Russia and Belarus last week signed a new union agreement.</p>
<p>But the document gave no timetable for economic integration and offered Belarus, which has hardly privatised and whose Belarussian rouble does not trade freely, the ability to modify reforms targeted in the document to its own needs.</p>
<p>So far there has been no official agreement that both countries envision a single federal government.</p>
<p>Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko said at the weekend that economic union would not mean a loss of statehood.</p>
<p>Dubinin, speaking on Sunday night, said that he envisioned a single independent central bank, based on the Central Bank of Russia.</p>
<p>&quot;We will make some kind of scenario where by stages we form a united Central Bank, on the basis, I am sure, of the Bank of Russia.&quot;</p>
<p>But Dubinin said that a number of questions, beginning with citizens' rights under a united government, needed to be solved before working out questions of financial union.</p>
