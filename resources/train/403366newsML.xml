<p>The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Wednesday approved the proposed merger of Enron Corp with Portland General Corp.</p>
<p>Commissioners said that they found that the tax-free stock-for-stock deal valued at $2.1 billion would not hurt competition in the wholesale electricity market.</p>
<p>&quot;We have found there is no significant impact on competition,&quot; FERC Chairwoman Elizabeth Moler said.</p>
<p>&quot;We are satisfied that the wholesale aspects of this merger are appropriately dealt with,&quot; she said at a commission meeting.  </p>
<p>Commissioners said one of the factors in favor of the merger was that Enron and Portland General had no big overlap of assets which could give them the ability to control the western power market.</p>
<p>Another factor in favor of the merger was that the companies had proposed to freeze their wholesale rates for four years.</p>
<p>Enron, a $15 billion international gas and electricity producer, proposed last year to merge with Portland General, a $3.2 billion regional utility with a strong base of inexpensive hydroelectric and natural gas-fired electricity.</p>
<p>The Oregon Public Utility Commission is now reviewing the impact of the merger on retail customers. It was expected to make a decision by March 17 but Enron Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said recently he expected the decision to be delayed slightly.</p>
