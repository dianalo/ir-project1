<title>SWITZERLAND: Von Moos quits steel pact with Von Roll.</title>

<p>Swiss steelmaker von Moos Holding AG said it would declare invalid a deal announced in June under which it would have taken over the Swiss domestic steelmaking business of Von Roll Holding AG.  </p>
<p>A von Moos statement alleged that its review of the steel business of Von Roll found higher environmental protection costs and lower production capacity than had been represented in the purchase contract of June 28.</p>
<p>Von Moos also said its review estimated 1996 cash flow would be minus 35 million Swiss francs or lower, rather than a positive 9.9 million Swiss francs as included in the financial plan for Von Roll Stahl AG, the domestic steel arm of Von Roll.</p>
<p>Von Moos on June 28 agreed to buy all shares in Von Roll Stahl AG to create the sole remaining steelmaker in Switzerland. Von Roll retained its engineering business.  </p>
<p>At Von Roll, a spokesman said the group had not heard of the statement or of von Moos' intention to invalidate the contract.</p>
<p>&quot;I have no comment at the moment,&quot; the spokesman told reporters.</p>
<p>At Von Moos, a staffer in the head office confirmed on the telephone that the fax statement sent to the media was genuine.</p>
<p>Senior von Moos officials were not immediately available for comment.  </p>
<p>The steel pact, funded by the big three Swiss banks, would have added sales estimated at 250 million Swiss francs to von Moos, which had 1995 sales of 652 million Swiss francs.</p>
<p>Von Roll wanted to shed loss-making steel operations to focus on three core businesses -- environmental technology, electrical insulation and engineering casting machinery.</p>
<p>Von Roll returned to profit last year with a group net of 27 million Swiss francs (excluding minority interests) after three years in the red, with a 1994 net loss of 298 million Swiss francs.  </p>
<p>Von Moos said the differences in environmental costs, cash-flow and production capacity had created a different situation than at the time the contract was signed.</p>
<p>&quot;The board of directors of von Moos Holding AG believes this does not allow the further pursuit of the plans for merger,&quot; the statement said.</p>
