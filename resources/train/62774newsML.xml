<p>Shanghai B shares closed down sharply and breached a key 50-point support level on Wednesday on selling of Pudong shares and further falls are likely in the short term on poor market sentiment, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index tumbled 0.671 points or 1.34 percent to 49.388 points, on volume of 14.9 million shares worth $7.9 million. Of 41 B shares, 34 traded, with 21 down, eight flat and five up.</p>
<p>Brokers said that heavy liquidation selling, especially of Pudong shares, in the afternoon session made the index breach the key 50-point support level.  </p>
<p>&quot;Domestic institutions failed to support the market above 50 points, which hurt market sentiment,&quot; one broker said.</p>
<p>&quot;Trading volume grew and the index fell, which showed that the market will fall further in the short term,&quot; a second broker said.</p>
<p>Pudong share Shanghai Wai Gaoqiao Free Trade Zone Development was the third biggest loser, falling $0.014 or 3.88 percent to $0.346, on volume of 242,300 shares.</p>
<p>Another Pudong share Shanghai Lujiazui Financial &amp; Trade Zone Development traded the most, ending down $0.020 or 2.22 percent to $0.880, on volume of 3.2 million shares.  </p>
<p>Shanghai Industry Sewing Machine was the biggest loser, falling $0.010 or 8.33 percent to $0.110, on volume of 11,000 shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai A shares closed down sharply because investor confidence was hurt by falls in the Shenzhen bourse.</p>
<p>The A index ended down 16.600 points or 2.04 percent at 795.258 points, on volume of 265.7 million shares worth 2.4 billion yuan. The SSE 30 dropped 49.574 points or 2.38 percent to 2031.943 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai Donghai was the biggest loser, falling 0.75 yuan or 6.57 percent to 10.65 yuan, on volume of 1.8 million shares.</p>
