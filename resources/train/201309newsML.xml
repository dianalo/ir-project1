<headline>Thailand's Narongchai says not in new cabinet.</headline>

<p>The chairman and chief executive officer of Thailand's General Finance and Security Co Ltd, Narongchai Akrasanee, said in Hong Kong on Tuesday he was not a part of a new Thai cabinet being formed, but was an insider.  </p>
<p>&quot;Dr Amnuay (Viravan) is forming an economic cabinet in Hong Kong. I've not been included in the cabinet,&quot; Narongchai, who went on to describe himself as an insider, told reporters after addressing an Asia Society luncheon meeting in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Amnuay, Thailand's current deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs, is visiting Hong Kong to address a World Economic Forum meeting. He said on Monday he was considering an offer to take over the economics ministry of a coalition government now being formed.</p>
<p>Narongchai had previously served as an economic adviser to Amnuay.  </p>
<p>Narongchai expressed optimism about the state of the Thai economy.</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot help feeling optimistic about the prospect that we will have a recovery and a more stable economy starting from 1997,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>He said he expected economic growth this year to be &quot;maybe six percent&quot; and saw exports growing by maybe three to five percent.</p>
<p>Narongchai said he viewed a plunge in the Thai stock market on Monday after Sunday's election as a temporary blip.</p>
<p>&quot;By the end of the day I think the whole market will recover to the level of before yesterday.&quot;</p>
<p>Thai stocks gained sharply in the morning session to 971.07 by the lunchbreak, up 3.05 percent.</p>
