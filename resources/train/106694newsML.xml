<p>Taiwan's Finance Ministry announced a &quot;two-into-one&quot; tax merger on Wednesday to boost investment and a slowing economy.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Paul Chiu said the ministry would merge the island's two income taxes into one business income tax of 25 percent.</p>
<p>The merger would cut tax revenues by about T$26.8 billion (US$975 million) a year, but the ministry would recoup the loss by assessing a 10 percent levy on profits that enterprises reserve rather than distribute to shareholders immediately, Chiu said.</p>
<p>&quot;The new tax system will avoid double taxation and will help corporate structures,&quot; Chiu told reporters.</p>
<p>&quot;In fact, this is a tax reduction,&quot; Chiu said. &quot;It will encourage investment (in Taiwan) and increase our international competitiveness.&quot;</p>
<p>Taiwan has been wooing multinationals to establish the island as a regional hub for Asia-Pacific operations by boosting local economic competitiveness.</p>
<p>The tax reform needed parliamentary approval and could take effect in 1998, the minister said.</p>
<p>Foreign nationals' taxes were not affected because their maximum rate would remain the same at 40 percent, Chiu said.</p>
<p>What the ministry has called a &quot;two-into-one&quot; tax merger is an accounting change that eliminates double taxation of companies' profits and the dividends they pay to shareholders.</p>
<p>Maximum assessments on domestic individuals' income will be capped at 40 percent, compared with the maximum 55 percent before the merger.</p>
<p>Currently, foreign investors' income is taxed first by a 25 percent business income tax, and then a 20 percent dividend tax on the 75 percent untaxed part, making the rate 40 percent.</p>
<p>Economists said the tax reform would only encourage domestic investment, not foreign investment.</p>
<p>&quot;Such a tax reduction reform will surely boost domestic investment,&quot; said Sun Ke-nan, a panel member from the prestigious Chunghua Institution for Economic Research.</p>
<p>&quot;But we don't see any improvement on how to encourge foreign investment in the proposal,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>&quot;In order to develop Taiwan into an Asia-Pacific financial centre, we may consider lowering the dividend tax on foreign investors to 15 percent from the current 20 percent,&quot; Sun said.</p>
<p>Foreign investors said they wanted more.</p>
<p>&quot;The tax reform really doesn't benefit foreign corporations at all, because foreign investors still have to pay 20 percent in dividend tax, and that dampens investment interest a great deal,&quot; said Ken Sien, a partner at Price Waterhouse.</p>
<p>&quot;The dividend tax tilts the playing field against foreigners. Taiwan must cancel that tax...if it really wants to become an Asia-Pacific financial centre,&quot; Sien said.</p>
<p>Sun said the planned levy of 10 percent on enterprises' reserved profits would discourage high-tech investments as they now enjoyed tax-free treatment of reserved profits of up to 200 percent of capitalisation.</p>
