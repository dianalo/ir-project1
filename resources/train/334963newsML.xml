<title>USA: CBOT corn ends higher on late fund buying, exports.</title>

<p>CBOT corn futures closed mostly higher on a late fund buying rally with strong weekly USDA export inspections lending support, traders said.</p>
<p>USDA Monday said 38.9 million bushels of corn were inspected in the week ended January 23. That figure, on top of last week's 42.4 million, was considered supportive.</p>
<p>Slow farmer selling contributed to gains. Cash bids firmed in some areas as farmers remained reluctant to sell.</p>
<p>Corn had traded weaker most of the day in response to Friday's surprisingly low USDA cattle on feed placement data, traders said.</p>
<p>USDA said the number of cattle placed on feed in the primary U.S. states during December totaled 1.423 million head, down two percent from a year ago and 10 percent below analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>But heavy fund buying late reversed the trend. Griffin Trading, Refco Inc and FIMAT Futures were among the late buyers, traders said.</p>
<p>On the day, Smith Barney bought at least seven to nine million bushels of corn. Tenco Inc bought one million March and 1.2 million July, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn closed 2-1/4 cents per bushel higher to 1/4 cent lower with March up 2-1/4 at $2.75.</p>
<p>Technical traders said another close above $2.75 in the March could attract some fund buying. Support was pegged at $2.72-3/4 per bushel and resistance at $2.76-1/2, they said.</p>
<p>Corn volume was estimated at 40,000 contracts, CBOT said. That compared with Friday's actual volume of 39,652 contracts.</p>
