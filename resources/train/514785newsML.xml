<p>Twelve people were killed and 13 injured on Wednesday when hooded, armed men burst into a Portuguese discotheque and set it on fire with petrol, police and witnesses said.</p>
<p>Eight of the dead were women. A French travelling salesman and a former Portuguese first division soccer player, Jose Guedes, were also among the victims, the Lusa news agency reported.</p>
<p>It said most of the bodies were found near an emergency exit which had apparently failed to open.</p>
<p>Witnesses said three men, wearing hoods and carrying guns, broke into the discotheque in the northern town of Amarante shortly before it was due to close at four a.m.</p>
<p>&quot;I saw three people wearing hoods come in and they fired four shots. The next minute, there were flames,&quot; one witness, 23-year-old Paulo Fernando, told TSF radio.</p>
<p>A police spokesman in Amarante said the fire had clearly been started deliberately but it was too early to comment on the reasons.</p>
<p>Local news reports spoke of a settling of scores  between rival gangs.</p>
<p>Nine of the injured were taken to hospital, two of them with serious burns, hospital sources said.</p>
<p>One man was being treated for a gunshot wound apparently suffered when he tried to resist the attack, but his condition was not serious, they added.</p>
<p>Manuel Amaral, manager of the 'Mea Culpa' (My Fault) discotheque where the fire occurred, told TSF that there were around 30 people there when the men broke in, ordering everybody against the wall.</p>
<p>&quot;There was just panic,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The men, dressed in black, told nobody to move and then started emptying petrol over the furniture, he said, adding that he had managed to escape through a back door.</p>
<p>&quot;They came and killed innocent people who had nothing to do with this,&quot; Amaral said, without elaborating.</p>
<p>The same discotheque had suffered another arson attack a year ago but that time there were no victims.</p>
