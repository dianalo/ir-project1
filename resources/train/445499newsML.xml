<p>-- REUTERS MAY MAKE HOSTILE BID FOR REED</p>

<p>-- CHINA SET TO TAKE BIG STAKE IN HK TELECOM</p>
<p>China has said that it wants Cable and Wireless to part with up to 20 percent of Hong Kong Telecom before it is allowed to play a big role in the country, which could be as much as two billion stg.

<p>-- DUNDAS CHOSEN FOR MEPC POST</p>
<p>MEPC, the property company, has moved to quell concerns over the departure of finance director Jim Beveridge.

<p>-- BZW TO BE SUED BY STAR TRADER</p>
<p>BZW is facing an unfair dismissal claim after dismissing Chris Grieve, one of its star equity traders, following the alleged documentation of a fictitious trade. He was dismissed weeks before he was due to receive a bonus worth hundreds of thousands of pounds stg.</p>
<p>SUNDAY TIMES</p>
<p>-- EFFICIENCY DRIVE COULD END JOBS FOR LIFE AT ROVER</p>
<p>BMW is hoping to change the &quot;jobs for life&quot; guarantee given to Rover's 39,000 workers to streamline Rover's workforce and transform productivity. Several thousand jobs could go. Rover's chief executive and chairman Walter Hasselkus is determined to increase efficiency, which is behind most of the European car industry.</p>
<p>-- NATWEST TO WIDEN PROBE INTO LOSSES</p>
<p>NatWest is set to widen its inquiry into the 90 million stg &quot;hole&quot; in its interest-rate options department to investigate whether any unjustified profits were made by counter-parties to the thousands of deals put through by Kyriacos Papouis since the losses began in 1994.</p>
<p>-- FRAUD CHIEF IN CALL FOR GCSE JURORS</p>
<p>According to Rosalind Wright, new director of the Serious Fraud Office, people should not be allowed to serve as jurors in complex fraud trials unless they have high-grade GCSE passes or O-levels in mathematics and English. There is huge resistance to interfering with the present system and the adoption of a two-tier system as suggested by Lord Roskill.</p>
<p>-- PEARSON HIT COULD TOP 200 MILLION STG</p>
<p>Media and entertainment conglomerate Pearson could face higher damages than expected as a result of the accounting scandal in the American arm of its Penguin subsidiary. Chief executive Marjorie Scardino said last month the company had set aside 100 million stg as full provision for the actions of Christina Galatro. They may double as a result of pending legal action by American Booksellers Association, the trade body which represents book retailers.</p>
<p>-- SUEZ AND LYONNAISE AIM TO MERGE INTO NINE BILLION GIANT</p>
<p>Compagnie de Suez, an industrial and financial holding company, and Lyonnaise des Eaux, a communications, services and construction group, two of France's biggest companies, are in merger talks to create a European super-conglomerate valued at nine billion stg.</p>
<p>THE OBSERVER</p>
<p>-- EVIDENCE OF 90 MILLION STG LOSS 'HELD BACK'</p>
<p>Sources claim that the 90 million stg &quot;hole&quot; in NatWest Markets' derivatives operations first came to light two months ago. Fears that the investment bank might have to set aside substantial sums to meet the losses were not passed on to its parent, NatWest, until the end of February.</p>
<p>-- UTILITIES' EXCESS PROFITS BLAMED ON LENIENT REGULATORS</p>
<p>A report by an all-party committee of MPs will blame lenient regulation for allowing privatized utilities to make huge excess profits. Shadow chancellor Gordon Brown will seize on the findings as ammunition to justify the Labour Party's proposed windfall tax on the companies.</p>
<p>-- GRANADA STRUGGLES TO FIND BUYERS FOR HOTELS</p>
<p>Granada, the leisure group, is unlikely to find buyers for three former Forte hotels. Buyers have spurned Grosvenor House in Park Lane and two hotels in Italy and Paris. Analysts say they would sell at less than their book value and Granada say they would rather keep the hotels than cut their prices.</p>
<p>-- BORROWERS TO HAVE REDRESS FOR BAD MORTGAGE ADVICE</p>
<p>Under a new code of practice for lenders homebuyers will have a right to redress for poor advice about mortgages. The code will make banks and building societies take responsibility for their suggestions for the first time. Lenders will not be obliged to give advice to everyone, choosing to sell loans on an &quot;execution-only&quot; basis, without making their own suggestions.</p>
<p>-- BARCLAYS SCRAPS PLAN FOR PHONE ADVICE ON FILLING IN TAX RETURNS</p>
<p>Barclays Bank is set to abandon plans to develop a cut-price telephone service to advise people on filling out tax returns, amid concerns about the risks it might pose to taxpayers. The new system would have increased demand from taxpayers for help in filling out returns, however, with a charged fixed fee of 50 stg, plus VAT, demand had not been strong enough to justify it.  </p>
<p>-- PEARSON RULES OUT TV SALE</p>
<p>Marjorie Scardino, Pearson's chief executive, has said that the company will not sell its television business. She views the operations as central to the company's future. This is a big blow to Greg Dyke who planned on leading a 500 million stg management buyout of the division.</p>
<p>-- BELL AND GUMMER IN TALKS OVER 100 MILLION STG PR MERGER</p>
<p>Two of the Prime Minister's closest advisers, Sir Tim Bell and Lord Gummer, have held renewed talks that may lead to a 100 million stg merger of their quoted PR companies, Chime Communications and Shandwick respectively. Shandwick's London operation has been hit by the defection of four key directors and Chime's Lowe Bell would bolster its financial PR side.</p>
<p>-- 'BUY-OUT' THREATENS KROLL TAKEOVER BID</p>
<p>Takeover talks between the world's biggest corporate detective agency, Kroll, and US credit information group Equifax have been hit by a proposed management buy-out by rebels at its London office. Arish Turle, Kroll UK's managing director, and chairman Richard Bradley are trying to put together an MBO following tensions with founder Jules Kroll.</p>
<p>-- GRILLING FOR TRAIN CHIEFS</p>
<p>John O'Brian, the director of the Office of Passenger Rail Franchising, and company directors are to face criticism from Parliament's Transport Select Committee over the South West Trains affair. The committee will accuse the regulator of &quot;serious lapses in stewardship&quot; of the privatized rail network.</p>
<p>-- SFO BOSS IN CASH PLEA</p>
<p>Rosalind Wright, the new director of the SFO, has called on the Government for more funding after a record case load, both in the UK and internationally. For 1997 to 1998, the SFO has had its budget cut to 15.9 million stg from 16.7 million stg this year and 17.4 million stg last. She also backs a shake-up in the law and judges' attitudes to white collar crime.</p>

<p>-- NUCLEAR DEAL TO KEEP OLD PLANTS</p>
<p>British Nuclear Fuels is set to absorb Magnox Electric, the company it set up to run and decommission ageing nuclear power stations. The merger will boost BNFL's share of the electricity market from one per cent to nine per cent and could add 200 million stg a year to its profits by the year 2000.</p>
<p>-- SOROS PAYS IN SPADES FOR CLUBS</p>
<p>Quantum, the investment fund owned by George Soros, has paid more than six million stg for three million shares in Capital Corporation, taking Soros's stake in the company to three per cent. It could prove crucial to Capital's future as it fights a hostile 190 million stg bid from rival London Clubs International.</p>
<p>-- WAGES RULE WILL PUT SEVEN PENCE ON PINT OF BEER</p>
<p>According to leading brewers, the Labour Party's plans to introduce a minimum wage will add seven pence stg to the price of a pint of beer, close rural pubs and cut bar jobs. Michael Turner, deputy chairman of London-based brewer Fullers, claimed that a four pound stg minimum hourly wage would increase his company's costs by 18 per cent.</p>
<p>-- ABBEY LINES UP FRIENDS IN NEED</p>
<p>Abbey National is poised to place a hostile bid for Friends Provident with a 1.8 billion stg takeover offer if it fails in its bid for Scottish Amicable. If Abbey win ScotAm, Friends will become the target by Prudential. Chief executive, Michael Doerr says that Friends might be prepared to demutualise, even though he has fought to keep his company independent and planned to grow the business.</p>
<p>-- THREE MILLION STG LOSS FOR FIRM SET UP TO BOLSTER LLOYD'S</p>
<p>New London Capital, the company set up to help Lloyd's insurance market through its financial crisis faces a 3.1 million stg loss on a key investment. This will come as a blow to Lloyd's chairman Sir David Rowland, who campaigned to rebuild his insurance market after it was devastated by losses of more than eight billion stg.
