<title>USA: Blue-chips edge lower, dollar rises.</title>
<headline>Blue-chips edge lower, dollar rises.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>Blue-chip stocks edged lower Monday, the dollar rose again against the Japanese yen and other currencies, and bonds ended little changed.</p>
<p>Oil prices rose. Gold edged higher.</p>
<p>In the stock market, investors took a defensive stance in the next-to-last session of another solid year on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 11.54 points at 6,549.37 after spending much of the session higher. A late burst of computer-driven sell programmes erased the rally, thwarting the Dow's run at a second straight record.</p>
<p>The index of 30 blue-chip issues rose 14.23 points to a record 6,560.91 on Friday.</p>
<p>&quot;Though it's hard to pick out a message from a day like today, it certainly seems the market has a defensive lean to it,&quot; said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. &quot;It reflects a deepening concern that it's going to be tough to make money in the market next year.&quot;</p>
<p>The Dow actually spent most of the session modestly higher, boosted by strong performances from oil companies Chevron, Texaco and Exxon.</p>
<p>But a pair of late sell programmes slashed more than 42 points off the Dow in the last 35 minutes of trading, according to Birinyi Associates, a firm that tracks programme trading.</p>
<p>While the Dow ended lower, 1,402 stocks rose and 1,065 fell in the broader market on light New York Stock Exchange volume of 339 million shares.</p>
<p>Many investors took vacation this week because of the New Year's holiday on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At Monday's close with one session left in 1996, the Dow's gain for 1996 stood at a very strong 28 percent, especially since the blue-chip index rose 33.5 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>In currency markets, the dollar rose against the yen amid a sudden lack of public pressure from Japanese officials to try to hold up the value of the Japanese currency.</p>
<p>In late U.S. trading, the dollar settled at 116.15 yen, up from 115.30 yen on Friday. The dollar rose slightly to 1.5550 German marks from 1.5545 marks.</p>
<p>The yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury was steady at 6.54 percent.</p>
<p>Crude oil for February delivery rose 15 cents to $25.37 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>February gold added 10 cents to close at $371.20 an ounce at New York's Commodity Exchange.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 index rose 24.7 points to a record 4,115.7, and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 average fell 7.69 points to 19,361.35.</p>
