<headline>NJ regulators approve GPU settlement.</headline>

<p>GPU Inc said the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities Monday approved GPU Energy's rate settlement which includes a variety of rate-related items to reduce rates for New Jersey customers of GPU Energy and provide rate stability into the year 2000.</p>
<p>The agreement provides for a net rate decrease of about $5 million, GPU said.</p>
<p>JCP&amp;L, now doing business as GPU Energy, the staff of the BPU and the Ratepayer Advocate had agreed to the settlement last June, pending review of GPU Energy's request to recover buyout costs for the Freehold non-utility generation project.  </p>
<p>The approval includes an agreement limiting GPU's recovery of any costs involved with the Freehold buyout to $135 million over seven years, according to Mike Filippona, GPU Energy's director of rates.</p>
<p>He noted GPU had agreed to buy out the proposed plant's owner, Freehold Cogeneration Associates LP, for $125 million and said it is still negotiating with the partnership's planned customer, Nestle SA, and natural gas supplier, New Jersey Resources Corp.  </p>
<p>If it costs GPU more than $10 million to settle these negotiations, Filippona said Tuesday, that amount will result in a charge against earnings.</p>
<p>The partnership is owned by Baltimore Gas &amp; Electric Co and Edison International.</p>
<p>The commission's staff has agreed to reach a final decision on the Freehold portion of the agreement in 90 to 1890 days, Filippona said.</p>
<p>As announced in June, the settlement includes a freeze on base rates until the year 2000 after a $12 million reduction in base rates and an about $7 million increase in the levelized energy adjustment clause -- resulting in the $5 million per year decrease. The agreement calls for no increase in the levelized energy adjustment clause 2000, unless there is an accumulated under recovery of $40 million in costs.</p>
<p>It proposes that earnings in excess of a 12.2 percent return on equity to be used to reduce base rates and potential stranded costs.</p>
<p>It calls for a $17 million nuclear depreciation expense increase, combined with a transmission and distribution, and general plant depreciation decrease of $12 million, for a net increase in annual depreciation of $5 million.</p>
