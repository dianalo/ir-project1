<title>UK: Britain orders probe into Zaire arms documents.</title>
<headline>Britain orders probe into Zaire arms documents.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-19</dateline>

<p>The government on Tuesday ordered an urgent probe into arms export controls after the discovery of documents indicating a British firm supplied military equipment to the Rwandan Defence Ministry when it was under Hutu control.</p>
<p>&quot;An inter-departmental committee...has today been established to examine rigorously our procedures in relation to the trafficking in arms and to determine whether there has been a gap in our controls,&quot; the Foreign Office said in a statement.</p>
<p>British media this week reported that documents found at the deserted Mugunga refugee camp in Eastern Zaire indicated Mil-Tec Corp, a company registered in the Isle of Man, had supplied the arms via Albania and Israel.</p>
<p>They showed that seven shipments of rifles, mortar shells, rocket-propelled grenades and ammunition worth 3.3 million pounds ($5.53 million) were made between April and July 1994 when the Hutus were massacring thousands of their Tutsi rivals.</p>
<p>Mil-Tec is already under investigation by the British customs service but the statement said there was no evidence to suggest it had committed an offence under British law.</p>
<p>It said the new committee, comprising senior officials from six government departments, would look at whether the government needed additional powers to prevent the supply of arms from third countries by British companies.</p>
<p>It will report to ministers within a month and its conclusions will be given to parliament.</p>
<p>Britain is Europe's largest arms exporter and allegations that it supplies repressive regimes have frequently embarrassed the Conservative government.</p>
<p>A report by a senior judge earlier this year criticised ministers for misleading parliament about the sale of arms-making equipment to Iraq in the run-up to the Gulf war.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians claim British jet planes sold to Indonesia have been used by Jakarta ruthlessly to crush East Timorese rebels demanding independence.</p>
<p>The World Development Movement, a British pressure group which campaigns on Third World issues, said action was urgently needed to stop arms firms getting round export bans.</p>
<p>&quot;The British government must take swift action to tighten up its arms export policy,&quot; said director Barry Coates. &quot;Arms exporters should not be able to exploit loopholes and profit from the misery and suffering inflicted by repressive regimes.&quot;</p>
