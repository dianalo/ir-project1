<p>Security at this year's Grand Slam Tennis tournament at Wimbledon is being stepped up, the All-England Club confirmed on Thursday, with officials and police eager to avoid a repeat of April's Grand National chaos.</p>
<p>&quot;Security has been increased and the Grand National was taken into account. We liaise very closely with police on these matters,&quot; an All-England spokesman said.</p>
<p>A bomb scare halted April's Grand National steeplechase. The race was postponed for two days.</p>
<p>The spokesman confirmed that two car parks would be moved to create a &quot;sterile&quot; area of around 200 metres along one of the main roads, but he stressed that the changes would not hugely inconvenience spectators.</p>
<p>&quot;We're not sending spectators off to the middle of nowhere,&quot; he said, estimating that people using the car parks, previously situated on the golf course, would have to walk a further 400 metres..</p>
<p>Visitors using public transport or other car parks would not be affected.</p>
<p>All bags will be searched when spectators enter the grounds and all vehicles will be checked as part of the increased security measures. In addition, closed circuit television cameras with recording equipment will scan the concourse.</p>
<p>&quot;The safety of all our visitors...is of paramount importance,&quot; Christopher Gorringe, chief executive of the club said in a statement.</p>
<p>The championships, which start on Monday, are expected to attract around 400,000 visitors over the two weeks. REUTER</p>
