<p>Nigeria's military government has set up a tribunal to try contractors who failed to carry out work they were paid millions of dollars for.</p>
<p>Finance minister Anthony Ani said on Monday at a briefing on the 1997 budget that the Failed Parastatals Contract Tribunal would investigate 18 projects on which about $836 million was spent but which were not implemented.</p>
<p>He said that last year, officials from the Federal Finance Ministry toured 30 Nigerian states to evaluate 145 projects financed with loans amounting to over $13 billion.</p>
<p>The team discovered 18 projects which were not carried out and termed them as &quot;failed&quot;, Ani said, adding: &quot;The proceeds were drawn and the contracts were purported to have been executed.&quot;</p>
<p>All those involved in the 18 &quot;failed&quot; projects would be brought before the tribunal and punished if found guilty. Government would extradite anyone involved who had fled abroad, he said.</p>
<p>In 1995, Nigeria set up the failed banks tribunal to try all those believed to have made off with sums of money and contributed to the problems that hit the banking sector.</p>
<p>Many businessmen and former bank executives have either been jailed or are in detention awaiting trial by the tribunal.</p>
