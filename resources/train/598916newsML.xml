<p>Railtrack Plc, the rail infrastructure giant privatised a year ago, on Tuesday finally unveiled details of its one billion stg investment programme which plans to upgrade 2,500 stations by 2001.</p>
<p>Sir Bob Horton, chairman of Railtrack, said the group planned to spend four million stg a day on the network and has linked up with a number of major contractors to deliver on time. When asked whether the threat of a possible windfall tax levy could hit spending plans, Horton said no.  </p>
<p>&quot;I have no infortmation on the windfall tax or whether it applies to Railtrack,&quot; he told the press conference referring to the Labour government's plan to tax the so-called &quot;excess profits&quot; of privatised utilities.</p>
<p>&quot;We have provided for this expenditure in our balance sheet and we have made a promise on this. We will spend this money,&quot; insisted the chairman.</p>
<p>Railtrack will be working with five construction partners over the coming years including John Laing Plc and Taylor Woodrow Plc.  </p>
<p>The contractors were whittled down from an original list of 70 tenders for the work which is a major contract at a time when public infrastructure spending is limited in the UK.</p>
<p>Responding to criticism that Railtrack has taken too long to bring its long-standing one billion investment on stream, Horton said the delay had been due to the group's detailed preparatory work.</p>
<p>Railtrack has been slammed by the rail regulator and by the Labour Party, before it was elected to government, for delays in meeting its spending promises.  </p>
<p>Labour's former shadow transport secretary Andrew Smith had told Reuters before the election that it would consider legislation to force Railtrack to meet its investment committments unless it addressed the problem itself.</p>
<p>Looking at the billion pound package which has now begun, refurbishment will include some of the country's biggest stations including London Paddington, Edinbugh Waverley, London Waterloo and Glasgow Central.</p>
<p>Regeneration budgets for stations range from tens of thousands of stg for a lick of paint to major developments costing 50 million per station.</p>
<p>The project will employ 5,000 people daily. This year more than 300 stations will be tackled, with 460 next year, 650 in 1999, 600-plus in 2000 and 500-plus in 2001.</p>
