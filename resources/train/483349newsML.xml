<title>CHINA: Shanghai T-bill repo rates close down, spots up.</title>
<headline>Shanghai T-bill repo rates close down, spots up.</headline>
<dateline>SHANGHAI 1997-04-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Contracts on the treasury bill repurchase market in Shanghai ended down on Wednesday with a technical correction on the domestic A share markets reducing fund demand on the repo market, traders said.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most active seven-day contract fell to 10 percent from 11.4 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Total turnover of the six-contract market fell sharply to 4.1 million lots from 7.2 million.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.</p>
<p>Share prices on both the Shanghai and Shenzhen A share markets fell on Wednesday on a technical correction.</p>
<p>In addition, two spot contracts matured on Tuesday and Wednesday and their redemption added money supply to the repo market, helping push down the rates today, traders said.</p>
<p>But the A share issue of Tianxing Meters Co on the Shenzhen stock exchange today gave some support to the repo rates, prevently them from losing sharply, they said.</p>
<p>There will be two A share issues, one in Shanghai and another in Shenzhen, on Thursday and traders said they expected the issues to push the repo rates up slightly tomorrow.</p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market in Shanghai ended up across the board on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Traders said fresh liquidity was flowing into the spot market due to redemptions of the two contracts.</p>
<p>A correction on the A share markets also helped some speculative funds to return to the repo market, they said.</p>
<p>The most active 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 rose to 117.85 yuan from 117.40 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume of the seven-contract market rose to 2.5 million lots from 1.9 million lots.</p>
<p>Traders said the spot market was likely to rise in the short term with a peak of state debt redemption drawing near. China will redeem 120 billion yuan worth in state debt in 1997.</p>
