<title>JAPAN: JGBs fall sharply towards close on BOJ comments.</title>
<headline>JGBs fall sharply towards close on BOJ comments.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-03-18</dateline>

<p>The key June Japanese government bond futures contract fell sharply on Tuesday due to comments by a senior Bank of Japan official which seemed to imply that the recent surge in JGBs had been overdone, traders said.</p>
<p>Masayuki Matsushima, director of the BOJ's research and statistics department, told reporters that the market does not always move in line with economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>&quot;The market sometimes overshoots,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The June ended at 125.95, down sharply from the previous day's close of 126.62. Turnover was 48,277 contracts.  </p>
<p>Matsushima said there is a theory that long-term interest rates move on expectations regarding inflation, and that theory may be confirmed when the movements of the rates are observed over the long term.</p>
<p>&quot;We may need more time to assess the basic trend of long-term interest rates,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The comments, which reached the market late in the afternoon, suggested that the BOJ wanted to check a further fall in long-term rates and led to selling, traders said.</p>
<p>The impact on the market is likely to persist, at least in the near-term, a trust bank trader said.  </p>
<p>JGBs had been falling late in the afternoon, even before the BOJ official's comments came out.</p>
<p>Selling of medium-term cash JGBs were behind the initial fall, a brokerage house trader said. The BOJ official's comments increased the downward momentum, he said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 182nd JGB yield stood at 2.285 percent as of 0658 GMT, up from the previous day's close of 2.205 percent.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, JGBs were pulled down by Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka's comments which said that a government scheme for improving land liquidity will be announced at the end of March.  </p>
<p>Mitsuzuka said he was told by Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on Tuesday to draw up the plan.</p>
<p>&quot;If we make effective use of land, it is true that this will have an impact on solving problem loans quickly for financial firms,&quot; Mitsuzuka said.</p>
<p>Traders said the impact from Mitsuzuka's announcement was limited, however, as no specific details were yet available.</p>
<p>&quot;Until the details are released it will be hard to decide how much to sell based on this news alone,&quot; a trader for a trust bank's securities unit said.  </p>
<p>One key for the market in the near term will be whether investors decide to buy cash JGBs on dips, the trust bank trader said.</p>
<p>&quot;Market players were saying that if JGBs fell to below 126.00, investors would probably decide to buy cash bonds,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>The market will be focusing on whether such buying actually emerges or not, he said.</p>
