<p>Hizbollah and Israel's local militia allies in south Lebanon carried out on Monday a swap of captives brokered by the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>Hizbollah said the deal with the South Lebanon Army militia (SLA) involved the release of three captives in a jail inside Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone in exchange for an SLA militiaman held by the pro-Iranian group.</p>
<p>The SLA sources said the three captives, all inhabitants of the border zone, were released from Khiam jail after spending between six and seven years in prison. They all crossed to Lebanese government-held territories in the morning.</p>
<p>Hizbollah sources said the SLA captive has been held by the pro-Iranian group for the past 10 years. They declined to give details on the number of remaining SLA captives.</p>
<p>&quot;This deal comes as a continuation to the captives exchange operation which Hizbollah is keen on completing until all captives in the jails of the Zionist enemy and its allies are freed,&quot; Hizbollah said in a statement issued in Beirut.</p>
<p>The latest releases brought to 180 the number of prisoners freed from Khiam in two years. About 145 Lebanese and other Arabs are still held without trial at the hilltop prison.</p>
<p>The Khiam prisoners are mostly anti-Israeli guerrillas, villagers who refuse to pay taxes to the SLA and people who refuse to let their sons be conscripted into the SLA.</p>
<p>Hizbollah (Party of God) guerrillas regularly attack some 1,000 Israeli troops and the 3,000-strong SLA occupying a 15-km (nine miles)-wide zone in south Lebanon.</p>
