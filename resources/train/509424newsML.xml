<p>New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani plans to challenge in court subpoenas issued by the state comptroller, who Giuliani blocked from auditing city agencies, saying the examinations were politically motivated.</p>
<p>&quot;If we get the subpoenas, we'll go to court, and we'll challenge,&quot; said Jack Deacy, a spokesman for Giuliani.</p>
<p>He added the Giuliani Administration remains open, however, to solving the dispute through negotiations.  </p>
<p>McCall, who said it was likely he would issue other subpoenas, said his audits were objective and pointedly asked why the mayor, a Republican, had blocked them.</p>
<p>&quot;It suggests he has something to hide, something he does not want discovered and disclosed to taxpayers,&quot; he said, noting some of the audits that were blocked were part of statewide programs. The state comptroller, a Democrat and potential candidate for governor, said that using the powers of his office to issue subpoenas, was an unprecedented step during his four years in office.</p>
<p>Giuliani specifically accused McCall of trying to sway the mayoral election in November. The mayor has built much of his reputation on his Administration's dramatic success in cutting crime, and one of the areas the state comptroller wants to audit is the Police Department's statistics. Some of the other audits also cover sensitive areas, like workfare, and how clean the parks are. &quot;If he wants to go to court, we're willing to demonstrate in court that he is acting in a way that is highly partisan. That is unfair and is intended to try to affect the mayoral election,&quot; the mayor told reporters.</p>
<p>The Giuliani Administration has never objected to fiscal audits, only ones that examine the city's services and are unveiled by the mayor in the Mayor's Management Report, the spokesman for the mayor said. Deacy added the comptroller was starting or already working on 22 audits, and had completed draft reports on two, a highly unusual volume, as he previously had not done more than eight in a year. &quot;We're not going to stand by and let him conduct what we see as these political management type audits, when we are overseen by the City Council and city comptroller,&quot; he said.</p>
