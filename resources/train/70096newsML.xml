<p>Pioneering cardiologist Michael DeBakey arrived in Moscow on Monday to advise a team of Russian doctors who will decide this week whether President Boris Yeltsin should undergo a proposed heart operation.</p>
<p>But DeBakey, a sprightly 88-year-old, said he could not comment on the planned operation because he had not yet had access to the medical facts. &quot;After that I will be able to make a comment,&quot; he said.</p>
<p>Asked how long he would stay in Moscow, he replied: &quot;As long as they wish me to.&quot; He was always optimistic about an operation, he added.</p>
<p>Russian doctors have said they would ask DeBakey to help advise them on how best to operate on the Russian president, who is now in hospital undergoing tests.</p>
<p>Top Russian surgeon Renat Akchurin, who trained under DeBakey, said at the weekend he thought Yeltsin had had a third, unreported heart attack during the election campaign and that the proposed surgery could be postponed for 6-8 weeks.</p>
<p>DeBakey, who works in Houston and is 23 years older than his new patient, conducted the world's first successful heart bypass operation. Russian surgeons have made clear he will not be operating on the president himself.</p>
