<p>Britain's National Grid Group's right to negotiate terms to operate Kazakhstan's power transmission system was in doubt on Monday when a Kazakh official said there was still no final decision on the tender.</p>
<p>Last month, National Grid announced it had secured exclusive negotiating rights for a 25-year contract to manage the former Soviet republic's 16,000 km (10,000 mile) high voltage grid, putting Sweden's ABB AB out of the running.</p>
<p>"There is no final decision (on the tender)," said a senior Kazakh privatisation official close to the deal who declined to be named.</p>
<p>Details of the contract are a closely guarded secret but last month a Kazakh official said the tender had been delayed while the government waited for both companies to improve their offers.</p>
<p>Tenders in the resource-rich Central Asian state are often delayed over last minute haggling. The Kazakh government has said the national grid is a strategic resource and would therefore not be privatised.</p>
