<p>The Warsaw Stock Exchange will likely decide at its supervisory board's next meeting on November 20 to lengthen bourse sessions, the exchange's president said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"If the (supervisory board) accepts, even informally, then the next day we'll issue a statement....The board's next meeting is on November 20," Wieslaw Rozlucki told reporters.</p>
<p>He said that all brokerages that are bourse members had given a positive opinion on the change.</p>
<p>The bourse has said it plans to lengthen its sessions by one hour, with the session beginning a half an hour earlier and ending half an hour later than at present.</p>
<p>Continuous trade would begin after the regular single price auction session ends instead of the two running concurrently.</p>
<p>For stocks trading in both systems the price at the single auction price system would be the starting point for the continuous trade system.</p>
<p>According to the change, the regular bourse session would begin at 10.30 a.m. and end at 11.45 a.m., with continuous trade beginning 15 minutes later. Continuous trade would end at 1.30 p.m.</p>
