<p>Blue-chip stocks extended their rebound into a second session Wednesday, boosted by gains in International Business Machines Corp.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EST, the 30-stock Dow Jones index was up 46.90 points at 6,355.23 after Tuesday's jump of 40 points.</p>
<p>The Dow had lost more than 200 points in recent profit-taking as investors cashed in profits from November's gain of 500 points.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues beat declines 2-1 on active volume of 278 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq index was up 16.74 points at 1,283.06. The American Stock Exchange index rose 3.97 to 574.28.</p>
<p>IBM joined the rally in high technology stocks, rising 3-3/4 to 155-3/8. Other gainers included industry giants such as Intel Corp., up 3-3/4 at 133-3/4 and Three Com Corp. gaining 3-3/4 at 76-1/8.</p>
<p>"The techs are continuing their bounce," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. "Once we get past all the volatility, the bottom line is that people are expecting earnings growth to slow next year and high techs have better short and mid-term earnings growth."</p>
<p>He said if Wall Street's fears of slower earnings in 1997 materialised, "the market will become an engine to search for growth, and techs continue to be the stronger area of growth."</p>
<p>"We have been looking at ourselves as being near-term overbought and we had a correction. It was quick and dirty," Bleier said. "We have (triple-witching) options expirations on Friday and that is adding volatility to the market."</p>
<p>December stock index futures and futures on options, as well as stock options, expire on Friday.</p>
<p>Biotechnology and drug stocks were also gainers.</p>
<p>Biotechs were led higher by Genetics Institute Inc., which surged 22-3/4 to 84-1/2 after American Home Products Corp. said it was buying the 40 percent interest in Genetics Institute that it did not already own for $1 billion. American Home was up 1-1/4 at 60-1/2.</p>
<p>The drug sector received a boost from news that Warner-Lambert Co. received Food and Drug Administration approval to market a powerful cholesterol-cutting drug. Warner-Lambert was up 2-3/8 at 76-5/8 and Merck &amp; Co. was up 1-5/8 at 77-7/8.</p>
<p>ADT Ltd. gained 2-3/4 at 22-7/8 after the company received a $3.5 billion buyout bid from Western Resources Inc., which lost  1/8 at 31-1/8.</p>
