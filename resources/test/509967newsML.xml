<p>Implied volatilities for short-dated dollar/mark options fell back as the spot retreated following a firm opening in U.S. trading Tuesday, options traders said.</p>
<p>Earlier, volatility had edged higher on support from a rally in the stock market that initially helped the dollar hold gains above 1.73 marks, options traders said.</p>
<p>U.S. asset markets were cheered this morning by news the consumer price index posted a mild 0.1 percent gain in March, and core CPI rose by a weaker-than-expected 0.2 percent.  </p>
<p>"The dollar rallied on the back of positive inflation news," said Ted Voorhees, senior trader at Deutsche Bank in New York. "Stocks rallied, and that lent support to the dollar."</p>
<p>The dollar crossed the 1.73 mark threshhold Monday afternoon for the first time in more than three years. However, the reaction in volatility was fairly mellow because the dollar's ascent was orderly, said a U.S. bank trader on the West Coast.</p>
<p>When dollar/mark slid back below 1.73, volatilities eased.  </p>
<p>"We need to get through 1.74 for vols to get a real bid," said Voorhees.</p>
<p>Implied volatility for one-month dollar/mark options was 9.1/9.3 percent Tuesday, steady with the previous day, after edging up to 9.2/9.5 on the opening. One-year dollar/mark was 9.55/9.80 percent.</p>
<p>A U.S. trader for a European bank argued the dollar's move above 1.73 marks "wasn't a real rally" because it was fueled by mark/yen sales and predicted midpoint one-year dollar/mark volatility would slide to 9.50 percent in the next few days.  </p>
<p>Dollar/yen implied volatilities slid as the spot stalled just above 126.00. One-month dollar/yen was 9.1/9.3 percent, down 0.3 point, with one-year at 10.3/10.45 percent, down about 0.2 point.</p>
<p>Risk reversals, the put-call pricing differential, remained skewed toward currency puts, at 0.3/0.6 for dollar/mark and 0.2/0.5 for dollar/yen.</p>
<p>One-month sterling/mark volatility rose to 9.7/10.1 percent from 9.4/9.8 Monday after sterling jumped to a 55-month high against the mark.  </p>
<p>Options traders also were keeping an eye on dollar/Canada after domestic Canadian interests were noted selling dollar calls and Canadian dollar puts, the West Coast-based trader said. One-month dollar/Canada volatility gained 0.2 point from Monday, rising to 4.5/4.9 percent.</p>
