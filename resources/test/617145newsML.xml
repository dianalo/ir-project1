<p>U.S. First Lady Hilary Rodham Clinton rounded off a day-long solo programme in Amsterdam on Tuesday with a tour of the Anne Frank house, wartime hiding place of the teenage Jewish diarist who later died in a Nazi concentration camp.</p>
<p>"(It was) very moving. I am very impressed with all I have seen," Rodham Clinton told journalists. "I hope the message of it keeps getting out to everyone."</p>
<p>She ignored questions on the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on Tuesday to waive her husband's immunity in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, ducking into her black stretch limousine and being driven away.</p>
<p>America's First Lady arrived at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport early on Tuesday for a programme of solo engagements before joining President Bill Clinton when he arrives in the Hague from Paris for meetings on Wednesday with the European Union.</p>
<p>The visit is combined with a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Marshall Aid Plan, which will be attended by leaders from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which groups Europe, Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>Earlier, Rodham Clinton urged a greater recognition of the role of women in promoting economic prosperity and upholding democracy in an address at the University of Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Addressing a 600-strong, predominantly female audience of dignitaries, aid workers and academics, she said the worst excesses of inhumanity occurred in countries which had lost sight of what women held most dear -- the care and nurture of children and families.</p>
<p>"If women were to stop working tomorrow inside and outside the home, the economy would collapse in short order," she told the gathering.</p>
<p>"The future of democracy depends not solely on our concept of realpolitik between and among nations, but what I have come to call real life politics -- in other words...it is about the internalisation of democratic values in people's minds and hearts."</p>
<p>Echoing George Marshall, U.S. architect of Europe's post-war reconstruction, she added: "Democratic principles do not flourish on empty stomachs...social investments are as critical to democracy and prosperity as free markets and trade."</p>
<p>Rodham Clinton's tour of the capital took in its best-known sights, including a boat trip through the canals, a visit to national museum the Rijksmuseum and the Anne Frank house.</p>
<p>"It's the classic first-time tour of Amsterdam," said one Washington aide.</p>
<p>A first for Rodham Clinton, the visit is also the first of its kind since 1788 when Abigail Adams, wife of future president John Adams, accompanied her husband and Thomas Jefferson to Amsterdam to raise funds from Dutch bankers for the fledgling U.S. congress.</p>
