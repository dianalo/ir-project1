<p>French luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy-Louis Vuitton has signed an agreement to buy a controlling interest in DFS Group Ltd worth $2.47 billion, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But the newspaper said billionaire Robert Miller, who owns a 38.75-percent stake in the DFS empire of duty free stores, was trying to block the sale of the interest by his partners.</p>
<p>Miller has said the deal would violate the terms of an agreement he signed with his partners in 1991, it said.</p>
