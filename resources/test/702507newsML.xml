<p>General Mills Corp., the nation's second largest cereal maker, said Wednesday it plans to increase prices an average of 2.6 percent, after cutting prices four times since 1993.</p>
<p>The maker of Cheerios, Lucky Charms and many other brands said the price increases, effective immediately, were intended to adjust for inflation.</p>
<p>A General Mills spokesman said he thought the increase was the first by a major cereal company since competitor Post Cereal, a division of Philip Morris Cos. Inc.'s Kraft Foods Inc. unit, shook up the $9 billion ready-to-eat cereal industry by cutting prices 20 percent.</p>
<p>General Mills, Quaker Oats Co. and leader Kellogg Co. followed that move to some extent. Analysts have said the price cuts failed to bring more consumers into the cereal aisles.</p>
<p>In a statement Wednesday, General Mills said that over the past four years, the prices of key components of the cereal company's cost structure have increased an average of 12 percent.</p>
<p>General Mills said the new prices remain lower than they were four years ago.</p>
<p>General Mills stock closed up 12.5 cents at $65.75 in consolidated trading Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
