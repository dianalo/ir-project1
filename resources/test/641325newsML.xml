<p>Europe's biggest PVC producer EVC International said on Thursday it had won an order to expand a PVC plant of Thai Plastic &amp; Chemicals Public Co Ltd (TPC).</p>
<p>EVC will provide the process technology and Bechtel International Inc of the U.S. will supply engineering, procurement and construction. The expansion of the plant, which is based 180 kilometres south-east of Bangkok, will raise its annual PVC production by 120,000 tonnes to 460,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>EVC, in which Britain's ICI and Italy's Enichem jointly hold a minority stake, gave no financial details of the contract.</p>
<p>Since 1990, EVC's Licensing Business unit has sold 47 licences to 30 companies around the world.</p>
<p>In 1997, the company's licensing activities included the start-up of plants in China, Taiwan, Australia, Saudi Arabia, India, the U.S. and Belgium.</p>
