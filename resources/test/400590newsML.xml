<p>Shares in Sherritt International Corp sprang to life on Tuesday morning after a recent speech by company chairman Ian Delaney focused attention on Sherritt's activities in Cuba.</p>
<p>Sherritt topped the most actives chart on the Toronto Stock Exchange by midday on Tuesday, rising C$0.30 to C$8.60 with almost 2.4 million shares trading hands.</p>
<p>"We operate at the highest levels of business conduct, ethically, economically and personally, period," Ian Delaney told a business audience on Monday. "We do not make compromises."  </p>
<p>Delaney has been banned from entering the United States and his company targeted by the U.S. Helms-Burton law, which penalizes foreign companies that do business in Cuba.</p>
<p>"Going to Havana to work for the day is no more difficult than going to Montreal. We used to say no more difficult than going to Montreal or New York, but now we just say Montreal," Delaney joked in his speech.</p>
<p>"Some of our best people chose our company just because they refuse to bend to United States foreign policy."</p>
<p>Sherritt is hosting a conference in Havana next week.  </p>
<p>The conference, run by the Economist magazine, would highlight the advantages of foreign investment in Cuba, Sherritt spokeswoman Patrice Merrin-Best said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the conference and a planned tour for analysts of Sherritt's operations in Cuba were attracting international attention and sparking heavy trading in the company's stock.</p>
