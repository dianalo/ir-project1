<p>Ukraine's parliament, just before breaking for summer holidays on Friday, voted 239 to 16 to increase Ukraine's budget deficit by 0.1 percentage points to finance construction of an ore refinery in eastern Ukraine.</p>
<p>Viktor Suslov, head of the parliamentary Budget and Finance Committee, told deputies the money for Ukraine's "largest" investment project, the Kryvorozhsky Hirnycho-Zbahachevalny Zavod, would be raised through the Treasury bill market.</p>
<p>"As a result of accepting this law, construction of the Kryvorozhsky factory will continue, and we are not spending a great amount of money to achieve great results," Suslov said.</p>
<p>The deficit contained in the 1997 budget, which parliament passed on June 27, had been set at 5.7 percent of gross domestic product, or four percent by International Monetary Fund (IMF) calculations. It will now rise to 5.8 percent.</p>
<p>Construction of the refinery began in the 1980s when the Soviet Union still existed, and the total cost has been estimated at $2.4 billion.</p>
