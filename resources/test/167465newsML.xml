<p>Suspected Moslem militants shot dead the marriage notary of a southern Egyptian village on Tuesday because he refused to pay them protection money, security sources said.</p>
<p>They said the unknown gunmen killed Abdel Ghani Mehani while he was tending his chicken farm near Mallawi town, some 260 km (160 miles) south of the capital.</p>
<p>The militants, believed to be members of the Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group) trying to overthrow the government, sped off in a red pick-up truck and police are searching for them, the sources said.</p>
<p>The Gama'a is most active around the southern town of Mallawi. Members have often robbed banks and jewellery shops for funds but the sources said they have recently resorted to extorting money from villagers.</p>
<p>Almost 1,000 people have died and scores more have been wounded since Moslem militant groups began a four-year-old campaign to transform Egypt into a strict Islamist state.</p>
