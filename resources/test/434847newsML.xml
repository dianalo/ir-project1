<p>Yaohan Food Processing and Trading Co Ltd shares fell more than 20 percent on Tuesday after Four Seas Mercantile Holdings Ltd set a low price in its general offer for the meat trader's shares, brokers said.</p>
<p>Shares of Yaohan Food were down HK$0.25 or 22.52 percent to HK$0.86 at midday on volume of 5.70 million shares.</p>
<p>Four Seas said earlier on Tuesday it would raise its stake in Yaohan Food by buying a 30.79 percent stake at HK$0.72 per share, brokers said.</p>
<p>"A wide gap between the offer price and the trading price triggered selling," said a senior sales manager at a regional brokerage. "The adjustment would help narrow the gap."</p>
<p>Four Seas said it agreed to raise its stake in Yaohan Food to about 40 percent from 9.21 percent for HK$54.92 million cash and, on completion of the deal, would launch a cash offer at HK$0.72 per share.</p>
