<p>U.S. spot residual fuel prices stayed little changed Tuesday, but interest remained thin and few expected much upside with the weaker demand shoulder period ahead, industry sources said.</p>
<p>"I don't see prices going higher for a while, and there is the potential for oversupply until the first sign of summer heat," said one cash trader, noting utility burns were light despite the approach of cooler East Coast weather this week.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, physical one percent held relatively steady at $15.25-50 a barrel, with May paper again up slightly with crude to about $15.25, traders said.  </p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour slipped a quarter to about the $16.50 area on reports New York Power Authority cancelled its 100,000 barrel HP tender. The best offer for very prompt material was in the high-$16 area (FOB), but traders said barrels next week were available in the low-$16s, which could tempt NYPA to reissue its tender next week.</p>
<p>NYH 2.2 percent notionally was unchanged at $14.00-25.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, one percent was little changed at $15.00-25, while three percent notionally eased slightly to $13.25, traders said.</p>
<p>No NYH or USG deals were reported.</p>
<p>New York city gate swing gas prices again jumped more than 10 cents Tuesday to the high-$2.30s/mmBtu, or $14.99 a barrel equivalent, on the approaching cold. Gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, firmed a couple of cents to about $2.00/mmBtu, or $12.60 a barrel.</p>
