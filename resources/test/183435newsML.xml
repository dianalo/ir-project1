<p>Shares in Home Depot Inc fell five percent on Tuesday on Wall Street's disappointment with a third-quarter earnings report, even though the numbers were in line with expectations, analysts said.</p>
<p>"People were hoping the quarter might be better than expected," said Prudential Securities analyst Wayne Hood.</p>
<p>"There are two other concerns: one's the possible peaking in the housing market, and we're heading into a period now where weather could affect sales in certain parts of the market," he said.</p>
<p>Home Depot earlier reported third quarter earnings per share rose to 46 cents from 37 cents a year earlier.</p>
<p>By midday, the stock was off 2-7/8 at 53-7/8 in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
