<p>Shares in Japan's banking sector O#BNK.T weakened in Tokyo on Monday on renewed selling interest after confirming an upside, with Sakura Bank Ltd leading the slippage.</p>
<p>As of 0432 GMT, Sakura was down 24 yen at 747 yen in turnover of 2.68 million shares, the third-largest volume on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Shares in Sumitomo Bank Ltd were down 50 yen at 1,470.  </p>
<p>"The recent recovery (of banking shares) was largely due to buying back. Such buying has petered out and there are no more major buyers," said one Japanese broker.</p>
<p>Brokers also said some companes were selling bank shares in an attempt to dissolve cross-shareholdings -- a practice by which companies hold each others' shares to strengthen business ties -- before closing their books for the financial year to March 31.</p>
