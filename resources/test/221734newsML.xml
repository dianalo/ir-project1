<p>A United Airlines Boeing 747, reported to be carrying 357 passengers, landed back in Hong Kong on Wednesday after an engine caught fire on takeoff, eyewitnesses said.</p>
<p>Fire trucks were deployed on the tarmac but there was no sign of smoke or flames. Other planes continued to fly in and out of the Kai Tak international airport, they said.  </p>
<p>The aircraft was surrounded by firefighting trucks, the witnesses said. Earlier, a fire service official said the fire had been extinguished while the plane was still airborne.</p>
<p>Alice Chiu, in the civil aviation public relations department, told Reuters flight UA806 had run into problems with one of its engines.</p>
<p>A United Airlines official said the jumbo jet was bound for San Francisco, having flown into Hong Kong from Singapore earlier in the day. Chiu said 357 passengers were aboard and about 10 crew.</p>
<p>Nobody had been injured and the plane was not known to be carrying dangerous cargo. "The problem is with the Number 1 engine," Chiu said. She said the cause of the fire was unknown.</p>
