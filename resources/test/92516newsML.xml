<headline>Indonesia says ready to face WTO on car policy.</headline>

<p>Indonesia said on Wednesday that it was ready to argue its case if Japan or the United States complained to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) about Jakarta's national car policy.</p>
<p>"We are ready to face the WTO," Trade and Industry Minister Tunky Ariwibowo told reporters. "We will hire lawyers."</p>
<p>A Japanese Trade Ministry official said in Tokyo earlier on Wednesday that Japan planned to file a complaint with the WTO on the controversial car policy within a week or so.</p>
<p>In February, Indonesia gave special tax and tariff breaks to PT Putra Timor Nasional to make a "national car" in partnership with Kia Motors Corp of South Korea, subject to meeting 60 percent local content requirements within three years of starting operations.</p>
<p>It has permitted the company, which is controlled by President Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra, to import the first batch of cars from South Korea. The company has supplied bank guarantees to cover customs duties that will be exercised if the local content requirements are not met.</p>
<p>Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) confirmed on Tuesday that Indonesia had not imposed any tariff on the cars produced in South Korea, the ministry official told reporters in Tokyo.</p>
<p>"As soon as we confirm the number and sales price of these cars, we will start the procedures for filing a complaint to the WTO within a week or so," the official said.</p>
<p>Tokyo argues that the special tax treatment for PT Putra Timor Nasional breaches World Trade Organisation rules and puts rival manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p>The United States said on Tuesday that it would also complain to the WTO on Indonesia's national car policy and would investigate if retaliatory measures should be taken.</p>
