<p>Dissident Congolese militia leader Denis Sassou Nguesso will give his response shortly to a unilateral ceasefire called on Wednesday by the army of President Pacal Lissouba in an attempt to end seven days of fighting between their forces.</p>
<p>Sassou Nguesso will give his response on official radio and on his militia's own radio station, his spokesman Amboise Lumazalaye told Reuters. But he said, "They are still firing on us despite the ceasefire having been declared."</p>
