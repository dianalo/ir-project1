<p>Boeing's takeover of McDonnell Douglas to create the world's largest defence and aerospace company reinforces the need for consolidation of Europe's defence industry, but progress is slow in the face of cross-border obstacles, experts said Monday.</p>
<p>"Europe has got to get together to be big enough to compete with the Americans on economies of scale and to be big enough to be involved in any future collaborative programmes as equal partners," one industry executive said.</p>
<p>But European firms are more inclined to join subsidiary businesses for specific missile or aircraft projects than seek outright mergers like the one announced Sunday when Boeing and McDonnell Douglas said they were joining to create a company with annual sales of $48 billion.</p>
<p>"Already the British and Germans are fully committed to integration and what I can see happening is that within 10 years the big European corporations will have gone and we will see instead a series of cross-border groupings," said defence analyst Paul Beaver of Janes Defence Weekly.</p>
<p>"There is already a sense of urgency ... We are now looking at how we do this much more seriously than ever before," another industry executive said.</p>
<p>The deal completed earlier this year by British Aerospace and French group Lagardere's Matra Defence to merge their missile businesses typified the snail's pace at which cross-border consolidation must proceed in Europe.</p>
<p>The deal took three years to complete, partly because of national sensitivities, and was done only after Britain placed an order with the two firms for Matra's Apache cruise missile.</p>
<p>"It took three years for Matra and BAe to get their businesses merged," said Beaver. "It has taken three-and-a-half months for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas to merge two companies that are probably 20 times bigger, and it took Lockheed and Martin Marietta only three hours to merge their companies."</p>
<p>Analysts say one way of resolving a desire by European governments to keep their national flag flying over their defence industries is to develop more common arms-buying programmes to create a single market.</p>
<p>Germany, France and Britain made the first move on this earlier this year with an agreement to set up a joint procurement agency, which has armoured cars as its first project.</p>
<p>"What you need is the convergence of procurement requirements and that is the next stage," said one investment analyst who declined to be named.</p>
<p>Prospects are already brightening for consolidation of European missile businesses now that a British requirement for development of the Meteor Future Mid-Range Air-to-Air missile for Royal Air Force Eurofighters has brought many of Europe's missile firms together to bid jointly with British Aerospace.</p>
<p>Companies involved include Matra BAe Dynamics, Daimler Aerospace, The General Electric Co., Alenia of Italy and Saab of Sweden.</p>
<p>In the meantime, British, German, French, Italian and Spanish aircraft firms are pushing to get their governments to back a multinational project to build a Future Large Aircraft military transporter to rival the Lockheed Hercules C130J.</p>
<p>Earlier this year France backed out of commiting to buy the new aircraft, but industry sources said Monday that Paris has now indicated it thinks it can find a way of backing the project after all, reviving industry hopes of getting it off the drawing board next year.</p>
