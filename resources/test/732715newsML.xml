<p>The supply of fed cattle on major U.S. feedlots, as of July 1, appears to be well above a year earlier following much larger placements during June than a year ago, livestock analysts said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is due to issue its cattle-on-feed estimates on Friday at 1400 CDT/1900 GMT.</p>
<p>"It should show we've got pretty big cattle-on-feed numbers that we've got to work through for the next month and a half. I think that will put a cap on prices," said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities.  </p>
<p>A Reuter survey of analysts' produced an average estimate for the number of cattle on feed in large lots in the leading seven states of 115.6 percent of a year ago.</p>
<p>"The report will confirm that we have large numbers to move through, whether its 115 or 117 percent," said Karl Skold, director of research at Frontier Risk Management.</p>
<p>June placements were estimated at an average 115.5 percent and June marketings at an average 104.0 percent.</p>
<p>"It continues to be a bit of distortion on the placement figure because year-ago was so low," said Tom Tippens, analyst with Professional Cattle Consultants.  </p>
<p>Tippens, who put placements at 125.1 percent of a year ago, said the total would be only six or seven percent above the five-year average.</p>
<p>"Corn prices are declining sharply and that is encouraging placements," said Tom Morgan, president of Morgan Research Group.</p>
<p>Analysts continued to estimate seven-state numbers while building historical data on the new 12-state part of the report. USDA made revisions to its seven-state report and introduced a 12-state report in January 1996.</p>
<p>They noted the rise in marketings during June partly reflected one more slaughter day versus a year ago.</p>
<p>Roose of U.S. Commodities said a four percent rise would indicate that feedlots were current on marketings.</p>
<p>"We've been pretty aggressively killing cattle," he said.</p>
