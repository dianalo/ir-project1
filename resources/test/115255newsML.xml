<p>French state-owned insurer Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance (CNP) chairman Pierre Darnis said he hoped 1997 would be the year the government enacted a long planned partial privatisation, daily Les Echos reported Monday.</p>
<p>Les Echos reported that Darnis believed a sale of one third of the company's capital next year was possible since no "technical" problems were left to block it.</p>
<p>"We've been waiting for three years, the green light from Bercy (the finance ministry) could come quickly," he told Les Echos.</p>
<p>Darnis also said he hoped the government would offer a capital increase of about three billion francs in order to shield the company from market turbulence.</p>
<p>"Putting the company on the market is necessary for a group the size of CNP...and it would be comforting to reinforce its capital by about three billion francs to be completely sheltered from financial markets' jolts," he said.</p>
<p>CNP is France's largest personal insurer. It is 42 percent owned by the state, 30 percent by the Caisse des Depots et Consignations, 17.5 percent by La Poste and 10 percent by the Caisses d'Epargne.</p>
<p>On Friday the company reported consolidated attributable profit of 741.2 million francs for the first half of 1996, a 4.3 percent increase over the year-earlier period. It predicted it would more than double that result for the full year.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1996, the company had turnover of 53.3 billion francs and the company expects it to rise to 90 billion in 1996, Les Echos said.</p>
