<headline>Court hearing for Italy's PM Prodi opens.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-01-15</dateline>

<p>A committal hearing to examine a prosecutor's bid to try Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi for alleged abuse of office and conflict of interest began behind closed doors in a Rome court on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The request relates to events in 1993 when Prodi was chairman of the huge state holding group IRI.</p>
<p>The prosecutor, Giuseppa Geremia, alleges that Prodi and five other IRI board members at the time awarded an "unjust advantage" to a little-known southern Italian consortium, Fis.Vi., in its purchase of food company Cirio.</p>
<p>Prodi, who has led a centre-left coalition since last May, denies any wrongdoing and has said he does not intend to resign. Neither he nor the others involved attended the hearing.</p>
<p>Legal sources said judge Edoardo Landi was likely to adjourn the hearing to a later date during Wednesday's opening proceedings because a lawyer for one of the defendants is absent at a trial in the northern city of Turin.</p>
