<title>YUGOSLAVIA: Wheat contracts find no buyers on Belgrade bourse.</title>

<p>The Belgrade Stock Exchange (BSE) reported no deals on Thursday in the first sale of wheat forward contracts aimed at raising funds to finance this year's sowing.</p>
<p>The Serbian Commodity Reserve Agency offered two tranches of wheat selling contracts, maturing July 15, 1997 worth nearly 150 million dinars ($29.77 million).</p>
<p>But traders said the lack of buyers caused no alarm and said the contracts need more aggressive marketing. A bourse official blamed the lack of interest on insufficient information.</p>
<p>"The details were published only yesterday and contracts will be on sale over the next two months," Goran Altaras of the BSE told Reuters.</p>
<p>Altaras said low buyer interest at the outset of the sale was expected because it was the first time securities with such a long maturity had been introduced.</p>
<p>According to earlier government statements, the agency was to finance the advance purchase of up to 1.2 million tonnes of the 1997 wheat crop by issuing wheat contracts.</p>
<p>The contract's face value is 9,000 dinars with 10 tonnes of wheat sold as collateral and carrying 32 percent interest.</p>
<p>The "D1" tranche of 5,500 individual contracts totalling 49.5 million dinars is reserved for buyers paying cash now.</p>
<p>A "D2" tranche of 11,000 contracts amounting to 99 million dinars is offered to investors paying in four instalments. Both will be on sale until December 3, the bourse said.</p>
<p>The contracts also provide the holder with an export licence.</p>
<p>A trader cited tight market liquidity as another reason for the lack of investor interest, but was optimistic that activity would soon emerge.</p>
<p>Many potential investors -- banks, flour mills and bakeries -- said introducing advance funding of the 1997 wheat crop was good and would prevent wheat prices surges.</p>
<p>Foreign investors cannot be first-hand buyers unless they have a company or some other outlet on Yugoslav territory.</p>
