<title>UK: Euro crude outlook - Dated down, other grades up.</title>
<headline>Euro crude outlook - Dated down, other grades up.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-08-23</dateline>

<p>Difficult refining economics and an awkward transatlantic arbitrage will keep European crude fundamentals tilted in buyers' favour next week, traders said.</p>
<p>But while differentials for leading Atlantic Basin crude Dated Brent will struggle, other North Sea grades might stage something of a recovery.</p>
<p>"Dated versus September will have to come off," said one major oil company trader.</p>
<p>"The (U.S.) arbitrage looks open for forward dates but not for prompt cargoes. We need lower numbers for the arb to work and I think that's what we'll probably get."  </p>
<p>Brent for September 3-5 traded at Sept paper less five cents on Friday, though most dealers valued it nearer parity.</p>
<p>Heavily backwardated paper markets mean this week's lower differentials for other North Sea grades are unlikely to fall further.</p>
<p>"The fact the backwardation is so steep means the grade premia are valuable," said a trader. "They appear to have bottomed out at these levels."</p>
<p>Prompt early September grades had been all but cleared out by Friday, leaving the path clear for better values, he said.  </p>
<p>U.K. Forties on Friday fetched Dated Brent plus 28 cents and Norway's Oseberg and Statfjord were pegged around plus 25-30 cents.</p>
<p>But sickly refining margins, on the mend by the end of the week, led by fuel oil and gas oil, were still keeping a lid on refinery buying.</p>
<p>A few refiners this week in Britain, Sweden, France and Italy announced run cuts, totalling about 150,000 barrels per day (bpd), to combat poor margins. Expectations of a heavy European autumn refinery maintenance schedule might also begin to tell next week on crude purchasing patterns, traders said.  </p>
<p>Sour Urals in the Mediterreanean, at Brent less 90 cents cif Med, was showing little sign of a recovery despite buying from northern Europe and the U.S. which cleared at least three prompt cargoes in recent days.</p>
<p>"The first decade (of September) looks quite bad. We'll be seeing things sliding further," said one trader.</p>
<p>West African grades, consistently stronger in recent weeks than their North Sea and Mediterranean counterparts, were finding support from more Asian buying, despite refinery run cuts in the east.  </p>
<p>Shipments east out of West Africa for September are set to run at about 500,000 bpd, roughly in line with August sales.</p>
<p>An apparently unattractive Brent/Dubai spread has not deterred buyers, mainly because regional benchmark Tapis has been running at such a high premium.</p>
<p>Differentials for Nigerian grades were still benefitting from a change in NNPC marketing policy which for the past two month has seen whole month loading nominations posted 30 days ahead. "It's been a success because it's given the market added flexibility," said a trader.</p>
