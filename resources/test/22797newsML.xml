<p>Analysts found little new in Danish telecom group Tele Danmark first half results on Thursday and after some initial yo-yoing the group's shares were virtually unchanged.</p>
<p>"The result was in line with expectations, we had expected 2.2 billion crowns before tax, it was 2.178 billion ($382 million)," said an analyst, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>The result was down on first-half 1995's 2.721 billion.</p>
<p>Some observers had been concerned about the possible effect of Tele Danmark's March purchase of a 16.5 percent share in Belgium's Belgacom but their were no surprises there either.</p>
<p>"Belgacom released their results two or three weeks ago so that was not new," the analyst said, adding that compared to other European telecom companies such as Britain's British Telecommunications Plc and Dutch KPN he thought Tele Danmark slightly undervalued.</p>
<p>At 1130 GMT the share traded at 275 crowns, down from Wednesday's closing 278, having swung between 272 and 280.</p>
<p>"There is nothing in the report to make you leap out of your seat. It's almost as good as expected so it's reasonable that the share should weaken a shade, but certainly not more," a second analyst said.</p>
