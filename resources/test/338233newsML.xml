<p>India's soybean output in 1996/97 (November-October) is expected to be sharply lower compared to that of last year, industry officials and traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said a delay in the onset of monsoon, intermittent heavy rain, cloudy weather, lack of dry spells with bright sunshine and then heavy rain in the third and fourth weeks of October in the central state of Madhya Pradesh contributed to the fall in the output.</p>
<p>Madhya Pradesh accounts for nearly 80 percent of the country's soybean production.</p>
<p>"The crop will be around 3.5 million tonnes," Navinbhai Shah, president of the Bombay Oilseeds and Oil Exchange Ltd, told Reuters. India produced 4.2 million tonnes of soybean in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, a senior official of the Central Organisation of Oil Industry and Trade (COOIT) said soybean output would be a maximum of 3.7 million tonnes. The Soybean Processors Association of India (SOPA) had estimated the 1996/97 output at 4.0 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Traders said India had so far contracted to export around 1.7 million tonnes of soymeal in 1996/97 compared with 1.2-1.3 million in the same period last year. India exported nearly 2.4 million tonnes of soymeal in 1995/96.</p>
<p>"The demand is mainly from China. More than 50 percent of the exports will be to them," Satyanarayan Saboo, a leading oilmeal broker, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Traders said soymeal for exports was currently quoted at $280-282 per tonne free alongside ship (FAS) compared to $284 last week. In the same time last year, it was around $230 per tonne.</p>
<p>"Foreign buyers are waiting for prices to fall before signing new deals," said Dinesh Jadhav, a leading oilmeal broker.</p>
<p>Traders said Indian soybean processing plants were operating at less than 40 percent capacity as arrivals had trickled to a minimum in the domestic Indian markets.</p>
<p>"Soybean arrivals were around 30,000-40,000 bags (one bag = 70 kg) in the central Indian markets compared to 80,000 bags same time last year," Shah said.</p>
<p>Traders said soybean was currently quoted at around 11,800-12,200 rupees ($330-340) per tonne in the central Indian markets, the hub of India's soybean industry.</p>
