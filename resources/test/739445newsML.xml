<p>French shares ended sharply lower but off their lows on Friday as investors woke up to the likelyhood that the new Socialist-led government would raise taxes on corporations on Monday.</p>
<p>A deep opening drop on Wall Street also weighed on the market.</p>
<p>A source close to the government said on Thursday that the government would raise corporate tax and company social security contributions to plug the deficit, expected to be about 3.6 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Afternoon daily Le Monde reported the corporate tax rise had already been decided. The measure would raise the effective rate of tax on corporate profits to around 40 percent from 36.6 percent currently.</p>
<p>The measures will be announced at 0830 GMT on Monday after the government sees the results of an independent audit of public finances ordered by Prime Minister Lionel Jospin.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 index was down 81.9, or 2.77 percent,  at 2,876.69. Earlier it fell as low as 2,843.41, a nearly four percent drop.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 July futures 2,860 vs 2,966 at Thursdays close.</p>
<p>The broader SBF-120 index was down 47.52 at 1,973.62</p>
<p>Total volume was 12.4 billion francs with 9.9 billion on the CAC-40.</p>
