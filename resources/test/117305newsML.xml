<p>WP Natural Gas, a division of Washington Water Power Co, filed Tuesday with Oregon Public Utilities Commission to reduce its natural gas rates in the state.</p>
<p>If approved by the Oregon regulators, the utility said it's residential gas customers would see their monthly bill decrease by 7.71 percent, starting Dec 1.</p>
<p>The filing primarily reflects decreases from WP Natural Gas' suppliers in the cost of gas purchased for use by the company's customers.</p>
<p>WWP said this would mark the third straight year it has filed for a natural gas price reduction in the state of Oregon, where its customers' gas rates have decreased by about 15 percent over that period.</p>
