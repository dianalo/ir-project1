<p>British Energy Plc has bought back 105.4 million stg of its bonds which were owned by the British Treasury, the utility said in a statement on Friday. The bonds, due 2016, were part of a 440 million stg notes issue made at the time of its privatisation by British Energy to the Treasury.</p>
<p>Also, British Energy said it exercised an option to reset the coupon and principal amount of the remaining bonds. The trigger for the option was any improvement in British Energy's credit ratings and/or moves in underlying gilt yields.</p>
