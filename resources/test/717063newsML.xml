<p>Britain's biggest electricals retailer Dixons Group Plc on Wednesday reported a summer spending splurge by shoppers in the first sign of the impact of windfall payouts from building societies converting to banks.</p>
<p>Dixons' shares leaped almost seven percent, boosted by the upbeat trading performance and strong annual results which revealed a 41 percent jump in profits before tax and exceptional items for the year to May 3 1997 to 190.2 million pounds ($321 million).</p>
<p>The company, owner of Dixons, Currys and PC World stores, said sales since the beginning of May had surged 17 percent, excluding new selling space.</p>
<p>The sales outstripped market predictions, which had looked for only a single figure increase.</p>
<p>Chairman Sir Stanley Kalms warned against expecting the current sales spurt to continue for the rest of the year, however.</p>
<p>"We're nervous to extrapolate that and we're saying that one shouldn't do so," he told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>Britain's shoppers were expected to go on a spending binge with the windfall cash pouring into their wallets from flotations of home loan groups such as the Halifax, now expected to total more than 30 billion pounds.</p>
<p>But evidence of where the money was being spent had been thin on the ground, until Dixons' figures confirmed predictions that a sizeable chunk would go on durables such as personal computers and household appliances.</p>
<p>Chief executive John Clare said product sales had been strong across the board in the past two months, but the emphasis on big ticket items suggested people were spending their windfalls.</p>
<p>"It would be naive of us to believe that there wasn't an impact on these current trading numbers because this amount of money is coming into the consumer economy," he said in an interview</p>
<p>But Clare also warned against reading too much into the group's current trading performance. He said recent rises in interest rates and expectations of another rise this week had to be taken into account.</p>
<p>"These sales figures announced today are really after only nine weeks of the year and our most critical period is over Christmas and that's still a long way to go."</p>
<p>Clare said that although the new Labour government's first budget last week did suck money out of the consumer economy, Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown himself had forecast growth in consumer demand of 4.5 percent this year and 4.0 percent next.</p>
<p>"If he's right it would suggest that the consumer economy is still likely to be strong."</p>
<p>The chief executive said Dixons had probably also benefited from unseasonal weather in June, which may have switched spending towards durables and away from fashion.</p>
<p>The group's shares stood 33 pence higher at 525.5 pence each. Share traders said retail analysts were likely to upgrade profit forecasts for this year after the top of the line results.</p>
<p>"We're expecting upgrades," said one.</p>
<p>Clare said personal computers had been selling well, cookers and cooking products, new technology products such as digital cameras, camcorders and hand held PCs.</p>
<p>He dismissed concerns that the PC boom, which has helped power Dixons recent profit growth, could slacken.</p>
<p>He acknowledged there had been one or two bearish reports on the PC market largely because of problems in the United States. But he saw the market continuing to expand in Britain.</p>
<p>"I think that the PC market in this country is set to be a growing one for some considerable time."</p>
<p>Sales at Dixons' PC World stores were up by 17 percent on comparable store basis in the year to May 3, 1997.</p>
<p>The group's other stores Currys and Dixons also had a reasonable year. Currys' sales rose seven percent on a like-for-like basis, while Dixons sales were up six percent.</p>
<p>The Link, the mobile phone specialist in which Cellnet owns 40 percent, boosted sales by 17 percent stripping out new space.</p>
<p>Dixons is adding 70 new stores this year, and expects to create around 3,000 new jobs.</p>
<p>Personal computers and related products increased their share of the group's sales to 29 percent from 23 percent. Total sales from the retail division in the year rose to 2.4 billion pounds from 1.9 billion. ($ = 0.592 British Pounds)</p>
