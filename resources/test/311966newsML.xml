<p>The only son of comedian Bill Cosby was shot dead near a southern California freeway early on Thursday as he stopped to change a flat tire on his Mercedes-Benz convertible, police said.</p>
<p>The body of Ennis Cosby, 28, was found sprawled on the pavement next to his car, and police said they had a witness to the attack. A white male suspect was being sought, and investigators said robbery appeared to be the motive.</p>
<p>Bill Cosby, a 59-year-old star comedian of film and television, was stricken with grief but kept his composure when told by phone of his son's death.</p>
<p>"We have every confidence in the LAPD," Cosby, who was in New York where his TV comedy "Cosby" is filmed, said in a statement. "Our hearts go out to each and every family that such an incident occurs to. This is a life experience that's truly difficult to share."</p>
<p>Cosby appealed to the Los Angeles Police Department to "do anything possible to find and locate and prosecute the suspect," said Cmdr. Tim McBride, a police spokesman.</p>
<p>Cosby, who also has four daughters, looked stern-faced and red-eyed when he appeared outside his apartment on Manhattan's upper East Side on Thursday afternoon, CBS radio reported.</p>
<p>He shook his head and when asked for comment, was quoted as saying "He was my hero" before returning inside. Ennis Cosby was studying for his second master's degree at Columbia University in New York, police said.</p>
<p>The attack took place near an exit ramp off the San Diego Freeway. Ennis Cosby was heading to a friend's house at the time, police said.</p>
<p>"He apparently experienced a flat tire, pulled his car off the freeway and was apparently shot for unknown reasons," McBride told reporters.</p>
<p>McBride said a woman saw at least part of the early morning attack and that she described the gunman as a white male. A police source said Cosby died of a single gunshot wound.</p>
<p>McBride said robbery may have been the motive but "it doesn't appear that anything was taken at this time."</p>
<p>He said Cosby may have been followed to the scene and appeared to have made at least one call on his cellular phone before the attack.</p>
<p>"I have just talked to Mr. Cosby in New York. He certainly has seen some significant grief," McBride said.</p>
