<p>The Victorian state government said on Friday an Asian shipping venture had withdrawn from a deal to build a container terminal at the Port of Melbourne.</p>
<p>Victoria's treasurer, Alan Stockdale said Victorian International Container Terminal Pty Ltd (VICT), a joint venture between Orient Overseas Container Line and China Ocean Shipping Co (COSCO) Group had withdrawn its offer after it was given a deadline of July 16 to file a final proposal.</p>
<p>Stockdale told a media briefing that the VICT offer represented about one quarter of the site's commercial value, and the government was not prepared to "give away" the site.  </p>
<p>"They wanted to be given a container terminal in Melbourne in order to promote a competitive advantage for their ships over other ships coming into the port," Stockdale said in a radio news broadcast.</p>
<p>In a statement, VICT said it had been frustrated and embarrassed by the bureaucratic processes and insincerity of the Victorian government and the Port of Melbourne Corp.</p>
<p>"VICT proposed a financially viable project in line with international standards and which had the added benefit of lowering costs, delivering port reform through a ground-breaking agreement with the Maritime Union of Australia, and bringing  </p>
<p>much needed competition to the Port of Melbourne," the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>VICT said the government had insisted on what is believed to be "grossly excessive and discriminatory rents" compared with rents charged to other stevedores in Melbourne.</p>
