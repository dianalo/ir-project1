<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin seemed a bit taken aback on Tuesday by the rousing welcome he received at a breakfast meeting of the Florida delegation to the Democratic Party convention. But he did not let it faze him.</p>
<p>Rubin, a self-effacing millionaire who spent much of his career out of the political limelight, steadfastly set out the reasons why President Clinton deserves a second term.</p>
<p>The president, Rubin told the applauding delegates, had the "guts" to take the tough decisions needed to slash the federal budget deficit. He lambasted Republican presidential challenger Bob Dole's tax-cutting plan, charging it would balloon the deficit, push up interest rates and hurt the economy.</p>
<p>A former investment banker who spent 26 years on Wall Street, Rubin is a man who seems more comfortable plotting international monetary strategy behind closed doors than giving a public speech aimed at pumping up the party faithful.</p>
<p>The Treasury chief acknowledged there was a difference between the two -- his fellow finance ministers do not applaud his performance at meetings of rich industrial nations.</p>
<p>Rubin's low-key style won the admiration of at least one delegate from Florida, a state where the New York-born Treasury chief spent most of his youth.</p>
<p>"Rubin is good," said Vivian Biagini, who has watched Rubin's televised appearances before Congress. "He always manages to stay cool."</p>
<p>Rubin, 58, is no stranger to politics. He has been active in raising funds for the Democrats for more than two decades and was head of the host committee at the party's 1992 convention in New York.</p>
<p>Sometimes his political sense serves him well, but not always.</p>
<p>He won laughter from Florida delegates when he quipped, "I don't know why the right-hand microphone is better than the left-hand microphone. But I'm going to speak from the center."</p>
<p>But when he tried to repeat that success before the arguably more liberal New York delegation, the joke fell flat.</p>
<p>Rubin gently warned both delegations not to become complacent -- Clinton is comfortably ahead of Dole in the opinion polls -- and to keep working hard in the run-up to the November 5 election.</p>
<p>For his part, the Treasury chief did not seem truly energized until after he left the delegation meetings and attended a policy forum to discuss ways to help the inner cities.</p>
<p>Known for his compassion for the poor as well as his grasp of high finance, Rubin has been a strong voice within the administration on the need to tackle America's social ills, especially those of its inner cities.</p>
<p>The Treasury chief has shied away from saying whether he plans to stay on the job if Clinton wins in November, although administration insiders are betting that he would.</p>
