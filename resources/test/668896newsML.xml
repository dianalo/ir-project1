<p>Midwest Express Holdings Inc on Wednesday said it expected its second-quarter earnings to fall short of analysts' current estimates.</p>
<p>Analysts on average were expecting the airline holding company to post second-quarter estimates of $0.81 a share, according to a First Call survey, versus $0.69 for the same period last year.</p>
<p>The company said earnings would come in lower than expected because of several factors, including an unscheduled aircraft engine repair, which will shave about $.08 a share off second-quarter profit.  </p>
<p>Midwest Express also said its board of directors voted to expand the company's share repurchase program by $10 million. It may now buy back up to $15 million of common stock, up from the $5 million limit authorized by the board in December 1995. About $2.8 million in stock has been repurchased to date, the company said.</p>
<p>Midwest Express said the reinstatement of a federal excise tax has held back yields. It said that several new routes have not yet reached full profitability, though they have generally met expectations.</p>
