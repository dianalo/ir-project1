<p>New Federal Trade Commission rules making merger approvals easier will lead to an increase in job cuts, according to a leading outplacement firm.</p>
<p>"It stands to reason that the more mergers, the more job cuts will result," said John Challenger, executive vice-president of the Chicago-based outplacement firm Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, Inc.</p>
<p>The changes, announced April 8 by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission, allow companies to argue that cost savings or an improvement in a product or service are benefits that outweigh the anticompetitive effect of a merger. The new, relaxed guidelines are also more in line with rules set by other countries.</p>
<p>"Companies are going to have to prove that lower prices will result from a merger. The easiest way to cut prices is to cut costs, which could very well mean cutting the payroll," Challenger said.</p>
<p>His firm tracks job cuts across the board, from clerks to hi-level executives.</p>
<p>According to Challenger, there were 11,189 job cuts due to mergers in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>There were 7,679 job cuts in March in the United States resulting from mergers of the 50,182 cut announced nationwide, up from the 3,204 jobs that disappeared after mergers in February.</p>
<p>In January of the 43,595 job cuts, only 306 resulted from mergers.</p>
<p>The FTC rules were changed in the middle of a merger wave. The number of merger deals has more than doubled in the last five years and numbered over 3,000 in 1996.</p>
