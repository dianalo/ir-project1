<p>The Ukraine's Black Sea oil port Odessa has been shut to tanker traffic since late Monday because of bad weather, shipping sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The sources said the port closed at 2300 local time on Monday and it was unclear when the port would resume tanker operations. There were no tankers berthed at the port and only one at anchor. A tanker scheduled to load 50,000 tonnes of fuel oil is expected to call at Odessa tonight, the shipping sources said. About 200,000 bpd of Russian crude oil production is exported through Odessa.</p>
<p>All other Black Sea and Baltic ports exporting Russian crude oil and products were operating normally on Tuesday, the sources said.</p>
