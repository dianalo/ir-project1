<p>First division Nantes, Nancy and Le Havre crashed out of the French Cup on Saturday, joining Monaco as first round victims of giant-killing teams from the lower divisions.</p>
<p>Nantes, eliminated six days ago from the League Cup by a second division side after going 17 matches unbeaten, went down 2-1 after extra time at third division Vitrolles.</p>
<p>Vitrolles coach Christian Dalger said: "We put up our courage and solidarity. We also had more desire to win, that's what made the difference."</p>
<p>His Nantes counterpart Jean-Clause Suaudeau said: "We made the same mistakes against Vitrolles as we did in the League Cup against Louhans-Cuiseaux. That proves that by not playing at 100 percent, you lose."</p>
<p>Nancy and Le Havre both fell to second division opposition, respectively 3-1 after extra time at Sochaux and 2-1 to Niort.</p>
<p>First division leaders Monaco were upset 1-0 at second division Laval on Friday.</p>
<p>Holders Auxerre had no trouble beating the amateurs of minor league side Vervins 6-0.</p>
<p>But Bordeaux needed extra time to overcome fourth division Brive. Level 1-1 after 90 minutes, Bordeaux settled the issue with goals by Kaba Diawara and veteran Jean-Pierre Papin. (to win 3-1)</p>
<p>Louhans failed to repeat their League Cup victory over Nantes -- they were on the receiving end of a 5-0 thrashing by third division Creteil.</p>
<p>Yugoslav striker Anto Drobnjak scored twice in first division Bastia's 4-2 victory at fourth division La Roche-sur-Yon.</p>
<p>European Cup Winners' Cup holders Paris St Germain play at third division Besancon on Sunday.</p>
<p>Marseille and Lille, involved in a legal tug-of-war over which is the home team in their all-first division tie, have yet to play.</p>
<p>The draw for the second round in three weeks time is scheduled for Thursday.</p>
