<p>Long-dated Australian bond yields struck lower again on the Thursday as weak retail trade data spurred on an initial U.S. led rally and took the 10-year yield to its lowest level since the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Although it is early days yet, given that the Reserve Bank only lopped a 1/2 point off official rate to 5.0 percent on Wednesday, any more data like today's could stir up thoughts of another monetary policy easing.</p>
<p>June retail trade fell 1.8 percent and second quarter real trade fell 0.5 percent when median expectations had been for small rises in both cases.  </p>
<p>"A dismal month for retailers to cap off a dismal quarter. These are not the sort of numbers that make retailers run out and hire new staff," said Craig James, senior economist at Colonial State Bank.</p>
<p>"If the RBA is treating the current cycle like past cycles, then it is making a mistake. The forces of job insecurity, redundancies and cost cutting are powerful and appear more than transitory," he added.</p>
<p>The 10-year bond futures contract hit a fresh record high of 93.675 on the data, overtaking the previous 93.640 peak last week, taking the 10-year yield below 6.35 percent at one stage.  </p>
<p>However, Commonwealth Bank senior economist Michael Blythe believes that the impact of previous interest rates reductions are now following through.</p>
<p>"We suspect that today's data may represent the last gasp of that weak spending picture," Blythe added.</p>
<p>September and December bill futures continued to trade below the new cash rate with the latter touching 95.14 at one stage, equating to a cash rate of 4.86 percent.</p>
<p>The focus now switches to the U.S., which faces a barrage of data over the next two days. The next key local event is next week's labour force report for July next Thursday.  </p>
<p>The U.S. market staged an impressive rally on Wednesday amid a broad brush of interest, but faces several tests, not least the July non-farm payrolls on Friday.</p>
<p>Later on Thursday the market sees the advanced second quarter GDP, the weekly jobless claims report and the Chicago Purchasing Management Index for for July.</p>
<p>---------------------(SPREADS)---------------------------</p>
<p> AUD VS   3-YR	   10-YR	* AUD 3-YR/10-YR SPREAD</p>
<p> USD	-30 (UNCH)    35 (- 05) * FUTURES   69   (- 07)</p>
<p> CAD	 71 (+ 01)    60 (- 03) * CASH	87   (- 07)</p>
<p> NZD     -146 (- 01)   -31 (- 08) *</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The recent buoyancy of the U.S. is expected to remain a positive backdrop for the local debt, keeping expectations high for a further narrowing in spread margins. Although the market has yet to take out last week's 25 b.p. low on the 10-year spread to U.S., analysts still see parity as a possibility.  </p>
