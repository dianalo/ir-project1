<p>The dollar was slightly firmer against the mark and the yen in morning Europe but off overnight highs in cautious trading as dealers pondered whether Friday's rout was the start of trend weakness or just a correction.</p>
<p>The dollar stabilised after Friday's sell-off of almost four pfennigs and over four yen. But it started here about half a pfennig and half a yen below overnight highs. A sustained rise above 1.85 marks and 115 yen might be difficult, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Nervousness will continue even though at this stage people are more inclined to be buyers than sellers," said Chris Furness, foreign exchange strategist at 4Cast Ltd in London.  </p>
<p>At 0730 GMT the dollar was at 1.8510/20, up from 1.8470/80 at the European close on Friday and from a low of 1.8383 on Friday but down from its 1.8550 overnight high. Dollar/yen was at 115.20/30, up from 114.84/89 late Friday and its trough at 114.25 but below its overnight peak at 115.62.</p>
<p>Furness said the market was a directionless, with no U.S. data scheduled for today and as traders awaited the Bundesbank's repo annoucement on Tuesday. "Nobody is quite prepared to put their foot into the water yet," he said.</p>
<p>The fate of U.S. asset markets after Friday's sharp sell-off is likely to give the dollar near-term direction, traders said.  </p>
<p>The sharp decline of the dollar last week was in part triggered by simmering speculation that the Bundesbank might switch to a variable rate repo or nudge the rate higher from 3.00 percent at present at Tuesday's repo tender.</p>
<p>The sell-off accelerated late in Europe on Friday after Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing was quoted in a newspaper as saying German price developments were moving in the wrong direction in all areas, including consumer prices.</p>
<p>Earlier last week - when dollar/mark was trading around 1.89 marks - Issing had said the Bundesbank was worried about dollar/mark's rapid rise.  </p>
<p>Many analysts expect the Bundesbank to stay put though because a rise in interest rates would hurt the nascent economic recovery in Germany.</p>
<p>Later in the week, the focus will be on U.S. data, with July retail sales and producer price data on Wednesday, followed by CPI figures on Thursday. German CPI data are also out this week.</p>
<p>Mark Geddes, treasury economist at ABN AMRO in London, said the downward correction in U.S. asset markets was especially important for dollar/yen movements.</p>
<p>He pointed out that in the first quarter of the new financial year, Japanese investors net purchases of foreign bonds were almost twice the level than in the same period last year.</p>
<p>"The longer jitters in U.S. asset markets persist, the less keen their appetite for U.S. paper," said Geddes.</p>
<p>Traders will also keep an eye on mark/yen for dollar/yen direction after mark/yen slumped to its lowest since July 1995 below 62 on Friday,</p>
<p>Mark/yen was at 62.11/14 down from 62.76/79 late in Europe on Friday.</p>
<p>Sterling/mark firmed, while cable held its ground despite the firmer dollar. The pound was at 2.9460/70 marks, from 2.9272/77 late on Friday. Cable was at $1.5860/70 from $1.5852/62.</p>
<p>Sterling hit a low at 2.9143 on Friday amid expectations that UK interest rates have peaked for now.</p>
