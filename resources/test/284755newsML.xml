<p>China's fixed asset investment was expected to grow to 2.775 trillion yuan ($334.3 billion) in 1997, up by 17.6 percent from 2.36 trillion yuan in 1996, the Economic Information Daily said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Expansion of foreign and local investment in 1997 would put huge pressure on fixed-asset investment controls, the newspaper quoted Zhang Hanya, deputy director of the Investment Institute of the State Planning Commission as saying.</p>
<p>China was expected to attract $44 billion in foreign investment in 1997, Zhang said.</p>
<p>The foreign investment would require 730 billion yuan in domestic auxiliary capital in 1997, with such matching funds accounting for 25 percent of total fixed asset investment, he said.</p>
<p>Zhang said the central government would restructure the economy to curb blind investment that concentrated funds in a few high profile industries.</p>
<p>Investment would be diverted into China's key infrastructure and pillar industries, he said but did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Zhang also called for legislation to strengthen the management of investment, but gave no details of what kind of law was required.</p>
