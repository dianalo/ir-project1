<p>Japanese trading houses, oil exploration firms and steel manufacturers are expected to form a consortium to join a Sino-Russian natural gas pipeline project by the end of the year, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>China and Russia reached preliminary agreement last spring on a multibillion-dollar plan to build a pipeline to send natural gas from Russia's eastern Siberia to China, and possibly to South Korea and Japan.</p>
<p>The pipeline route has not been decided, but one of the suggested courses is one from gas-rich Irkutsk near Lake Baikal, through Mongolia to the Yellow Sea, they said.  </p>
<p>Japanese participation is expected help Japan secure a cheap, stable supply of natural gas, widely regarded as clean energy, while giving the Sino-Russian side much-needed financial support for the massive project, traders said.</p>
<p>The estimated cost of the project ranges from $4.5 billion to as much as $14.4 billion if the pipeline was extended all the way to Kitakyushu in western Japan, said Mikhail Surtsukov of Sidanco, Russia's fourth-biggest oil company in terms of reserves.</p>
<p>Surtsukov told at a seminar earlier this week in Tokyo that the Kovyktinskoye field in Irkutsk has 870 billion cubic metres (30.6 trillion cubic feet) of proven gas reserves.</p>
