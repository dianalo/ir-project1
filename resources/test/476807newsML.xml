<p>China must rely on new technology to boost its cotton output because of a shortage of arable land and limited prospects of a government-approved price rise, the China Business Daily said on Monday.</p>
<p>It quoted Chen Junsheng, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives as saying that acreage planted was declining and that the government was unlikely to try to spur output by raising its price for purchases from farmers.</p>
<p>He said that quality of cotton seeds supplied to farmers had to be maintained, he said.</p>
<p>China would also try to boost cotton production by merging small-sized cotton farms, he said.</p>
<p>The All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing would continue to exclusively handle cotton purchasing, processing and trading this year, he said. No other units and individuals would be allow to trade cotton.</p>
<p>China's cotton output for 1996 has been estimated at 4.0 million tonnes, down by 800,000 tonnes from the previous year.</p>
<p>China's 1997 acreage under cotton was estimated at the lowest level in 10 years at 4.56 million hectares, down by 4.2 percent from last year, the official media have said.</p>
