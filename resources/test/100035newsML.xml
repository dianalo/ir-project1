<p>The State Compensation Insurance Fund, California's largest workers' compensation carrier, said on Monday it was paying policyholder dividends of about $55 million.</p>
<p>The Fund said thousands of state employers would receive checks over the next several months under the largest dividend payout this year in the workers' compensation industry.</p>
<p>Dividends are a return of a portion of premiums collected from policyholders who have managed to reduce their workers' compensation losses below original expectations for a given policy period.  </p>
<p>The $55 million in dividends includes an initial declaration by State Fund of about $31 million for the first quarter of 1995, as well as an estimated additional $24 million arising from the adjustment of its 1994 policyholder dividend.</p>
<p>State Fund said it anticipates additional dividend declarations for the second, third and fourth quarters, as well as a routine adjustment of the 1995 policy year, which should bring the total payout to about $97.5 million.</p>
<p>The State Compensation Insurance Fund is California's largest provider of workers' compensation coverage with approximately 250,000 policyholders.</p>
<p>Established by the California state Legislature in 1914, State Fund guarantees the availability of workers' compensation to all California employers.</p>
