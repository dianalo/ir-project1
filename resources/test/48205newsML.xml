<p>Tokyo stocks closed mostly lower on Thursday, with participants cautious ahead of the settlement of September futures and options on Friday. Worries about the domestic economy and a lack of political measures to shore it up clouded the market, brokers said.</p>
<p>The key 225-share Nikkei average closed off 127.11 points or 0.62 percent at 20,443.93. But its December futures gained 10 points to end at 20,600.</p>
<p>"There were vague fears ahead of settlement and that kept people from moving actively," said Tetsuya Ishijima, chief strategist at Okasan Securities Co Ltd.</p>
