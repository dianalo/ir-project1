<p>Greek construction firm Michaniki expects to post earnings growth of 25.5 percent in 1996 with pretax profit reaching 5.1 billion drachmas, its chief financial officer told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said pretax profit is expected to advance 39 percent to 7.1 billion drachmas in 1997.  </p>
<p>"Michaniki proved it can achieve strong earnings growth capitalising on its competitive edge in know-how and mechanical equipment when it comes to large, complex construction projects," said chief financial officer Aris Drakatos.</p>
<p>Fiscal 1996 turnover rose 19 percent to 23 billion drachmas and should shoot up to 27 billion this year. On a consolidated basis, the Michaniki group expects to post 1996 turnover of 26.9 billion drachmas, 35.3 billion in 1997, he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Its dividend payout for 1996 will be close to 50 percent. Its 1995 dividend per share was 115 drachmas.</p>
<p>Drakatos said Michaniki's orderbook stood at 133 billion drachmas. Of this amount 37.2 billion drachmas had to do with yet uncompleted projects.</p>
<p>Self-financed BOT projects which also include projected operational revenues amounted to 55 billion drachmas. Such projects included the Rhodes Casino, a parking facility at Kotzias square in Athens and the cemetary of Piraeus.</p>
<p>Michaniki also projects revenues of 41.2 billon drachmas from other real estate operations -- sales and rental income.</p>
<p>"We have strategically diversified our portfolio and are no longer just a construction firm. We expect that in the next four years EU funding for infrastructure projects will dry up," Drakatos said.</p>
<p>Shares of Michaniki gained 35 drachmas to close at 2,235 on heavy volume of 127,070 shares. --George Georgiopoulos, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
