<p>The phenomenon known as "flipping," or quickly reselling shares received in an initial public offering to lock in short-term gains, is the nemesis of underwriters.</p>
<p>Be it because the IPO has been heavily promoted, or because of low investor confidence, flipping can create havoc with a company's stock price after the initial offering.</p>
<p>"In really strong IPO markets, you're able to put the stock into stronger hands. In weaker IPO markets the stock will find its way into less steady hands," said Sheldon Sandler, managing director of corporate finance at Ladenburg Thalmann.</p>
<p>High-profile deals enveloped in hype are also likely to see more flipping in their shares, according to some analysts.</p>
<p>"There seems to be more flipping when there's a lot of hype around the deal," said Ryan Jacob, director of research at IPO Value Monitor. Inflated expectations pump up first day premiums and create an opportunity for quick profits, he said.</p>
<p>An IPO Satisfaction Survey conducted by Stapleton Communications Inc., a Mountain View, Calif.-based investor relations firm, found that, on average, technology companies surveyed that went public in 1995 and during the first quarter of 1996 would like to see underwriters improving on their ability to place shares with long-term investors.</p>
<p>But analysts said that underwriters are often compelled to look the other way, especially when it's the large institutional investors who are doing the flipping.</p>
<p>"It's often the big institutions who are the flippers," said John Fitzgibbon, editor of the IPO Aftermarket, "(but) are you going to go back to Fidelity and say 'you've been a bad boy - we're not going to give you the next issue?'"</p>
<p>Flipping is no more prevalent today than in the past, analysts said, but it is perhaps gaining more attention because now it can be tracked easily.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure it's worse than it has ever been," said Lizabeth Moses, syndicate manager at Unterberg Harris. Citing the recent availibility of the Depository Trust Corp.'s stock trading system, she said, "maybe it's a lot easier to find, so it's drawing more attention," she said.</p>
<p>The new system records trades and allows underwriters to get a better idea of who the flippers are without having to go through the cumbersome procedure of tracking the actual physical exchange of stock certificates.</p>
<p>This week, the IPO watchers see no trail-blazers on the horizon. Vincent Slavin of Cantor Fitzgerald said his picks are PSW Technologies Inc. by Alex Brown, RF Micro Devices Inc. by Montgomery Securities, and Silverleaf Resorts Inc. by CS First Boston.</p>
<p>Slavin said he sees a premium of a $1 per share, or a little bit more, on the deals.</p>
<p>PSW Technologies, a software services firm that serves technology vendors and business end-users, is offering 2.85 million shares at $8 to $10 each. RF Micro, which provides integrated circuits for wireless communications, is selling around 2.5 million shares with a price range of $9 to $11.</p>
<p>Silverleaf Resorts is a developer, marketer and operator of timeshare resorts in the economy segment of the timeshare industry. It's deal consists of 3.5 million shares expected to price between $13 and $16 each.</p>
<p>Jacob of IPO Value Monitor said he likes Pameco Corp. and Melita International Corp. Pameco, a distributor of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, equipment and refrigeration products, is seeking to raise around $50 million and Melita, which provides customer contact and call management systems, around $35 million.</p>
