<p>French Social Affairs Minister Barrot said on Wednesday the rise in French unemployment had been halted after official figures showed the number of jobless fell by 4,800 in March.</p>
<p>"One can consider that since the final quarter of 1996, the rise in unemployment has been stopped," Barrot told reporters after attending a cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>Barrot said that in the latest March jobless data, the number of young unemployed had fallen significantly but he said long-term unemployment remained a problem.  </p>
<p>Labour Ministry figures showed the raw number of unemployed dropped by 0.2 percent to 3,087,500. But the jobless rate, based on International Labour Organisation criteria stripping out jobseekers who did any work, was unchanged at a record 12.8 percent.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Alain Lamassoure told Reuters that Prime Minister Alain Juppe had told the cabinet meeting the figures indicated unemployment had stabilised and there had been a clear improvement in the youth unemployment picture.</p>
<p>He said the number of young unemployed had dropped by 6.5 percent over the past six months.</p>
<p>The number of unemployed young males under 25 fell by 1.8 percent in March to 272,500 while the number of unemployed young women under 25 fell by 0.9 percent to 313,000.</p>
<p>"This shows the policies of stimulating (business) activity and helping promote youth employment are starting to bear fruit," Lamassoure said.</p>
<p>Asked if the monthly jobless figures would continue to fall, Lamassoure replied, "One cannot say (that they will fall) month by month. What is certain is that once growth reaches around 2.5 percent over the course of the year, we should see a regular fall in unemployment in the second half."</p>
<p>A finance ministry official said that the Labour Ministry data suggested that "what we are seeing now is stabilisation of the jobless numbers".</p>
<p>"With a pickup in growth we should see a trend toward a gradual reversal of the unemployment curve," he told Reuters.</p>
