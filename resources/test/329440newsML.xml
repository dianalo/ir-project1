<p>Standard and Poor's Corp said on Thursday it assigned a BBB long-term rating to P.T. Bank Negara Indonesia's $145 million senior notes issue due 2007.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P said the bank's rating outlook is stable.</p>
<p>S&amp;P also assigned the bank an A3 counterparty credit rating.</p>
<p>The Indonesian government owns 75 percent of the bank.</p>
<p>The ratings reflect the likelihood of government support for BNI if the bank becomes financially distressed and BNI's stand-alone risk profile, which includes a defensible market position in Indonesia, reasonably structured balance sheet, improved capitalisation and acceptable profitabilty, S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>It said a rating sensitivity is BNI's high level of non-performing assets in an international context.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P said that while it believes the Indonesian government is likely to support BNI if the bank experiences financial difficulties, the government's willingness to do so may be tempered over time because of the trend towards partial privatisation of state banks.</p>
<p>BNI was partially floated in November 1996. Its liabilities are not guaranteed by the government.</p>
<p>BNI is Indonesia's largest bank with US$13.8 billion equivalent in assets, S&amp;P said.</p>
