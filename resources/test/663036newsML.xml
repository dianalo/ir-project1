<p>France began pulling its troops out of the Congo Republic capital on Monday after evacuating more than 5,000 foreign nationals caught up in a bloody political and ethnic dispute in its former colony.</p>
<p>With the diplomatic focus shifting to peace talks hosted by neighbour and fellow oil-producer Gabon, Brazzaville enjoyed a relative lull in fighting -- despite occasional bursts of shooting which has been part of life in the city since June 5.</p>
<p>A first contingent of several dozen French soldiers climbed abroad a military transport plane with their rifles and full kit and left for Chad. Others followed on later planes.</p>
<p>France is pressing ahead with the withdrawal despite an appeal from Congo President Pascal Lissouba that it leave troops in the city as a buffer force between the army and militiamen loyal to former military leader Denis Sassou Nguesso.</p>
<p>"About 300 (soldiers) are expected to leave today for Chad and Gabon on 16 flights. Combat units will stay until the last moment to show a presence and to ensure security at the airport," French army spokesman Colonel Henry Pellissier said.</p>
<p>France is, however, keeping its embassy open.</p>
<p>The conflict began when the army surrounded Sassou Nguesso's home in a crackdown on private militias and unauthorised arms in the run-up to a presidential election scheduled for July 27.</p>
<p>The death toll from the fighting could run into hundreds, or even thousands according to some sources.</p>
<p>France called on Monday for the election to go ahead. "An immediate return to democracy via a presidential election is essential to the future of Congo," its foreign ministry said.</p>
<p>Lissouba says the election should take place as planned. Sassou Nguesso has called for guarantees of transparency, fairness and security first.</p>
<p>Lissouba has called for an African peace force, an idea which Sassou Nguesso has not ruled out. Mediators say it will be on the agenda of the Gabon talks.</p>
<p>Envoys of Lissouba and Sassou Nguesso left on the same plane on Sunday for Gabon's capital Libreville. The presidents of Chad, Mali, Gabon and Central African Republic will attend the talks.</p>
<p>Sporadic firing of mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and machineguns could be heard around the airport through the night and Monday morning but it was quiet compared to Saturday night.</p>
<p>Soldiers loyal to Lissouba patrolled the road from the airport to the city centre and his Koy Koy militia cruised around in old cars with guns poking through the windows.</p>
<p>France had around 1,200 soldiers in the city. They initially went as part of a Western operation to evacuate foreign nationals from Kinshasa, in the event of a bloodbath at the end of the civil war in former Zaire. It never occurred.</p>
<p>Reception points in the city for evacuees who were kept there before being brought to the airport have been closed. An estimated 30 foreigners who did not make it on Sunday were to be flown out on Monday on military flights.</p>
<p>"If somebody calls to us for help, then we will still pull them out even up to the last minute," Pelissier said.</p>
<p>The two rivals declared a truce on Wednesday but some Western analysts fear the battle will ignite around the city's international once French troops leave.</p>
