<p>Russia's largest oil producer LUKoil has plans to issue new preferred shares but will not make the move in 1997, the head of its securities division said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"In the future we will look at a preferred share," LUKoil Vice President Leonid Fedun told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>"One variation is a preferred share convertible to ordinary shares," he said.</p>
<p>"I do not think there will be any (new) issues this year aside from the global issue," he added, referring to plans to issue level-three American Depositary Receipts representing 15 percent of LUKoil shares held by the government towards the end of the year.</p>
<p>But Fedun said that LUKoil might issue new prefs this year in order to pay for acquisitions. "There might be one exception -- if LUKoil acquires some structures in Russia."</p>
<p>Earlier OAO Neftyanaya Kompaniya LUKoil said it had received approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to issue ADRs on its existing preferred shares.</p>
<p>At 1445 LUKoil prefs were $13.10, up from Thursday's closing $11.75 and ordinaries were $15.30, up from $15.10.</p>
