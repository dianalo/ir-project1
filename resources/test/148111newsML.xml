<p>Loctite Corp said on Monday it will review a proposal from its largest shareholder, Henkel KGaA of Germany, to buy all its remaining stock.</p>
<p>Loctite Chairman David Freeman said in a statement, "The company, its board of directors and management, and their various advisers, will obviously review this proposal to determine the proper response.</p>
<p>Henkel, which owns about 35 percent of Loctite shares, said earlier that it would propose to purchase the remaining stock for a price in the range of $56 per share. Loctite stock was trading at $58 per share in early New York trading.  </p>
<p>Henkel earlier said in a statement that its managing director Hans-Dietrich Winkhaus had met Loctite President David Freeman at the weekend and informed him of the bid.</p>
<p>The company said it has offered to start talks with Loctite aimed at a swift and friendly takover, but added that it might make a public takeover bid if the talks foundered or failed to make progress.</p>
<p>In its statement, Loctite said, "We will also bear keenly in mind the effect any of this may have on our worldwide employees, whose everyday contribution and commitment make Loctite the quality company it is." It did not comment further.</p>
