<p>France will supply Charles Sobhraj, jailed in India for more than 20 years, with a travel document allowing him to reach the country, the Foreign Ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>Born to an Indian father and a Vietnamese mother, Sobhraj says that he is a French citizen and France has for the past week studied his record and nationality claims. India had said it intended to deport him to France.</p>
<p>"Our embassy will in the next few days deliver to Charles Sobhraj a travel document giving him access to French territory," ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux told reporters.</p>
<p>"Competent authorities will continue to examine his situation. Given the elements at our disposal, we did not think we could oppose his coming to France," Doutriaux said, adding that Paris had not managed to establish his nationality.</p>
<p>Sobhraj, whose actions across Asia have been the subject of two books, was released on bail in February and immediately detained on grounds he lacked proper papers.</p>
<p>He was first arrested in India for holding up a hotel jewellery shop in 1971. He was later charged with a long string of crimes including murder, serving time for some and winning acquittal in others.</p>
