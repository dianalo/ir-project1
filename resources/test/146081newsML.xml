<p>Botswana's private sector has listed parastatals and government departments it considers ripe for privatisation in a report welcomed by the government at the weekend.</p>
<p>"Our analysis showed there is substantial potential for privatisation in Botswana," Modiri Mbaakanyi, director of the Botswana Confederation of Commerce, Industry and Manpower, told reporters late on Friday.</p>
<p>The report, compiled by Coopers and Lybrand accountants for Mbaakanyi, named the Botswana Meat Commission (BMC), Botswana Telecommunications Corp (BTC) and loss-making Air Botswana as top candidates for public share issues.</p>
<p>"Opportunities for quick successes should be identified in order to demonstrate that the programme can obtain results," said the report.</p>
<p>"At least one public issue should be promoted to attract public attention to the programme."</p>
<p>Finance Minister Festus Mogae welcomed the report.</p>
<p>"The issue of privatisation has been exercising our minds for some time," he told Mbaakanyi.</p>
<p>BTC had a trading profit in 1995/96 of 18.5 million pula ($5.2 million). It has 60,000 subscribers, with demand growing 20 percent a year.</p>
<p>The report suggests privatisation as a joint venture competing in a freer telecommunications environment with other newly licensed operators.</p>
<p>Two cellular network licences are due to be granted soon. BTC will bid for one with a joint venture partner.</p>
<p>BMC had a 40.8 million pula operating profit in 1995/96. It has capital and reserves of 147 million pula.</p>
<p>Botswana Airways has 270 staff, more than it has seats on its three aircraft. It flies 100,000 passengers a year.</p>
<p>Debt of 75 million pula was written off in 1994 after capital restructuring, but the airline lost 2.1 million pula in 1994/95. A similar loss is projected for 1995/96.</p>
<p>The report listed seven parastatals and departments for immediate privatisation and five others, plus some local councils, as candidates to hand over some operations to the private sector.</p>
<p>Immediate privatisation was also suggested for the debt-ridden Botswana Housing Corporation (BHC).</p>
<p>Botswana Savings Bank was named as a candidate to go private but it was felt unlikely there would be interest.</p>
<p>Major contracting out of services was recommended for Gaborone City Council, Botswana Railways, the Department of Supply and the Government Printer.</p>
<p>The Botswana Power Corporation was not seen as a candidate for a major privatisation project.</p>
<p>More than 20 other parastatals, departments and councils not examined in detail were listed as possibly suitable for complete or partial takeover.</p>
<p>The Bank of Botswana headed this list.</p>
<p>The report said a start should be made by running the public sector along more commercial lines.</p>
<p>"An arms-length relationship should be established between government and parastatals which would give the parastatals greater freedom in taking pricing, operational and investment decisions," the report said.</p>
<p>"There will be be significant revenue for the government," it added. "This could all amount to hundreds of millions of pula annually."</p>
