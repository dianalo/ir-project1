<p>Position-squaring ahead of the weekend combined with weak demand softened prices of Indian and Korean GDRs while shares in Taiwanese firms held firm on Friday.</p>
<p>"There was some selling pressure in a few Indian blue chips but it was mainly adjustments of deals," a dealer said.</p>
<p>The bull run on Indian Hotels witnessed in the last few weeks came to an end as it shed $1.62 to close at 22.5.</p>
<p>"The premiums is more realistic," a trader said.</p>
<p>Although most GDRs of Indian firms like Century Textiles, Bajaj Auto and ITC were marked lower, traders said it was mainly on speculation by market makers.</p>
<p>"It was just a little bit of profit booking, nothing to do with fundamentals", a dealer said.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected Indian GDRs to remain sluggish in the run-up to the central budget on February 28.</p>
<p>Dealers said lack of institutional support in Bombay would have its impact on GDRs.</p>
<p>"Its always like that before the budget," a dealer said.</p>
<p>The Cazenove GDR index down 2.10 points or 2.65 percent down at 77.12 while the Capel GDR index was down 2.45 points or 3.43 percent at 68.96.</p>
<p>Korean GDRs came under selling pressure with a few Far East traders squaring up positions on Friday.</p>
<p>The Capel Korea GDR index fell 3.25 points or 5.17 percent to 59.59 while the Capel Taiwan index reflecting a quiet trade, held firm at 104.56, gaining just 0.74 points or 0.71 percent.</p>
