<p>Shares in General Accident benefited from renewed takeover hopes on Wednesday after the company was highlighted as a favourite bid target by the Daily Telegraph newspaper.</p>
<p>The shares were up 6-1/2p at 748p by 1105 GMT after earlier climbing to 753p. Persistent rumours of a major deal to be done in the financial sector helped the shares climb to a record 774p in December.</p>
<p>"The paper picked out General Accident as the one most likely to be picked out next," said one trader. "That's the reason behind the strength in the share price."  </p>
<p>The newspaper said General Accident's life assurance arm gave the company added appeal for those in the industry seeking less exposure to the general insurance market.</p>
<p>The report said that at a price of 741-1/2p the shares stood at a premium of three percent to net asset value, compared with 12 percent for Commercial Union.</p>
