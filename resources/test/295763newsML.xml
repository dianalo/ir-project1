<headline>ARS says Yeltsin may sign De Beers deal.</headline>

<p>A senior Russian diamond executive said on Thursday that the government was preparing a presidential decree that would give the go-ahead to a gem export agreement with South Africa's De Beers.</p>
<p>Lev Safonov, first vice-president of Almazy Rossii-Sakha, or ARS, Russia's diamond producer and De Beers' negotiating partner, told Reuters that Finance Minister Alexander Livshits had ordered officials to prepare the document, which would be presented to President Boris Yeltsin for signature.</p>
<p>"I can't say when or in what form an agreement will be signed, but I believe it will be signed," he said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin checked into hospital on Wednesday with pneumonia only two months after major heart surgery, and there was no official news on when he might return to work.</p>
<p>A deeply frustrated De Beers made good on its threat to stop buying diamonds from Russia on December 31, 1996 when it cancelled an interim arrangement after the Russian authorities failed to approve or reject a new trade deal.</p>
<p>Safonov declined to say whether Yeltsin would sign the decree, saying only that the document would eventually be presented for his signature.</p>
<p>ARS and De Beers officials had said Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and various ministries were responsible for approving a diamond export deal, but said Yeltsin might be brought in to save the arrangement.</p>
<p>"There is no senior official in Russia who is opposed to a deal with De Beers," Safonov said, declining to comment on why senior Russian officials had failed to sign a formal deal and allowed the interim arrangement to collapse.</p>
<p>Livshits told Russian news agencies in December that Moscow wanted to reexamine the draft deal, setting off a storm that led De Beers to cancel the interim arrangement. The Finance Ministry later said it was not opposed to a deal.</p>
<p>De Beers controls about three quarters of the world diamond market and Russia accounts for about 25 percent of all rough gems De Beers sells.</p>
