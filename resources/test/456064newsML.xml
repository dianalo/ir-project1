<p>There is much sound and fury in Colombia over Washington's decision to "decertify" the country for a second year as an ally in the fight against drugs, but some diplomats and officials say most of it signifies nothing.</p>
<p>They say the United States, at the risk of being perceived as a paper tiger, pulled most of its punch when it did not order any economic sanctions to back its censure.</p>
<p>President Ernesto Samper denounced U.S. decertification when it was announced last month, calling it unfair and saying the world's biggest consumer of illegal drugs had no business setting itself up as a global policeman.</p>
<p>Government officials have warned that Colombia might downgrade its relations with Washington because of the move. And Samper abruptly suspended the aerial spraying of Colombia's illicit drug crops on March 5 in a retaliatory move that may have been timed to coincide with a rare anti-American protest outside the U.S. Embassy. The spraying has since resumed.</p>
<p>Officials were especially angered by the certification decision because Mexico -- a nation rocked by myriad drug corruption scandals -- was certified as a U.S. ally while Colombia was lumped together with Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Nigeria and Syria as a country worthy of public opprobrium.</p>
<p>Colombia's Ambassador to Mexico Gustavo De Greiff was among the first to criticise the "hypocrisy" of backing one country, because it shares a border with the United States and is its partner in free trade, while beating up another that is far away and of little economic importance to Washington. "They've treated us like international thugs," De Greiff said.</p>
<p>MEXICO SEEN WEIGHING IN COLOMBIA'S FAVOUR</p>
<p>The Colombian government has avoided public comment on the Mexico decision, however. It can ill-afford to tarnish the image of a country that it badly needs as a friend and which has been a leading critic of the annual drug certification process ever since it was introduced in 1986.</p>
<p>Whether or not it deserved better treatment than Colombia, which U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has described as a country awash in corruption, diplomats say Bogota benefitted from the scandals that put Mexico under such close scrutiny during this year's "certification sweepstakes."</p>
<p>"They (Washington) were so embarrassed about having to certify Mexico that they couldn't be too hard on Colombia," one Bogota-based diplomat said. He noted that decertification for a second year could have triggered painful economic sanctions that Washington fell short of imposing last year. But sanctions have basically been ruled out for now, and the diplomat said "that takes most of the bite out of decertification."</p>
<p>U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns warned, after Colombia's surprise suspension of aerial spraying of coca leaf and opium poppy with herbicides, that Washington reserved "the right to take further action" against Colombia.</p>
<p>But press guidance issued by the State Department on Feb. 28 indicated that sanctions would only be imposed under enormous provocation.</p>
<p>CELEBRATING BEHIND THE SCENES</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Maria Emma Mejia has called the annual grading of Colombia's performance in the anti-drug fight "a hateful mechanism" and said it confronts the country "with two enemies -- drug traffickers and American decertification."</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, she and others may well be celebrating, however. As Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo told reporters recently, "decertification really has had no harmful effects."</p>
<p>Colombia's first decertification cut off the country's access to U.S. military financing and training programmes. It also meant that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation could no longer underwrite insurance for U.S. companies investing in the country.</p>
<p>The White House requested a waiver of both cut-offs this time around, however, and the country is apparently in for no economic punishment at all.</p>
<p>"The outlook is much clearer now that we know the U.S. decision," a statement from Samper's team of economic advisers said. "Unlike 1996, when there was no specific statement on the matter, the U.S. government's declaration regarding Colombia's decertification in 1997 makes it clear that economic relations between the two countries will not be affected."</p>
<p>Diplomats predict continued sabre-rattling in Colombia in the weeks ahead as it bridles against U.S. pressure to show an unfailing commitment to the drug war. They say the noise is likely to die down quickly, however, as the government gets to work on U.S.-imposed "benchmarks of performance" that would ward off the threat of renewed decertification in 1998.</p>
<p>Those benchmarks include lifting the country's constitutional ban on the extradition of Colombian nationals and the effective implementation of recently approved anti-drug laws. Colombian business leaders have urged Samper to twist any arms necessary to ensure that extradition is restored this year.</p>
