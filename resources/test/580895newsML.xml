<p>The South Korean gold market was expected to be bearish this week as the nation's continued economic downturn depressed gold demand, Seoul traders said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The economic slowdown will keep this week's gold trading bearish," said a trader with LG Metals Corp.</p>
<p>The South Korean bullion market will be closed on Wednesday for Buddha's Birthday.</p>
<p>But traders said a recovery in world market prices stemming from the dollar's fall against other major currencies had raised the domestic gold price.</p>
<p>Gold producer LG Metals' daily selling price for the precious metal, which is regarded as a benchmark for the local bullion wholesale market, rose on Tuesday to 10,360 won per gram from 10,250 won a week ago.</p>
<p>The company's silver price also rose to 154 won a gram from 152 won a week earlier.</p>
<p>The telegraphic transfer selling rate for customers, posted by the Korea Exchange Bank, rose to 894.10 won against the dollar from 895.40 won a week ago. The rate is regarded as a benchmark of local foreign exchange rates for companies.</p>
