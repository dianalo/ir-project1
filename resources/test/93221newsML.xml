<p>British opposition leader Tony Blair looked set on Thursday to win overwhelming support for an election blueprint that he hopes will sweep his Labour party to power after 17 years in the wilderness.</p>
<p>Delegates at Labour's last conference before a general election due within seven months voted on the document after backing the leadership on a series of key policy decisions.</p>
<p>The result of the vote will be made known on Friday, and party officials said they expected little if any dissent.</p>
<p>The blueprint, "New Labour, new life for Britain," will then be put to a ballot of all 400,000 Labour members as the final step in Blair's strategy of locking the party into his programme -- an insurance policy in case the going gets rough in government.</p>
<p>Endorsement of the policy statement was a formality, but it capped a day that showed how strong a grip Blair has taken on a party he took over just two years ago.</p>
<p>Labour's once-dominant left wing was swept aside in two votes, on pensions policy and defence, ensuring a clean sweep of conference ballots for Blair's centrist, modernising leadership for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>"This heralds a new era in the history of our party," defence spokesman David Clark said after delegates rejected a call for the scrapping of Britain's Trident nuclear deterrent.</p>
<p>"The British people will recognise that they can now trust Labour with the defence and security of our country. The party's old divisions on defence should now be gone forever."</p>
<p>The story was the same on pensions, when a bid to force a future Labour government to link pensions to earnings, championed by veteran former cabinet minister Barbara Castle, was rejected by a margin of two to one.</p>
<p>Blair, haunted by the way the Conservatives capitalised on Labour's spending plans at the 1992 election, has been determined to avoid any pledges that would expose it to charges that it was still wedded to discredited tax-and-spend policies.</p>
<p>Labour enjoys a commanding poll lead of more than 20 percentage points, with voters evidently weary of 17 years of unbroken Conservative rule.</p>
<p>But Blair has stressed that the poll advantage could melt away unless Labour convinces people that it is safe to switch their votes to a Labour party that is radical yet responsible.</p>
<p>The transformation of Labour from a working-class party championing the underdogs in society into a vehicle for the aspiring middle classes was also evident on Thursday in Draconian plans to tackle drug-related crime.</p>
<p>Home affairs spokesman Jack Straw, outflanking the Conservatives in an area they have traditionally called their own, announced proposals for mandatory treatment of hard drug addicts combined with random follow-up testing.</p>
<p>"There is now only one party of law and order, and that party is the Labour Party," he said.</p>
