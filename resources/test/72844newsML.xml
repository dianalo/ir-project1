<p>Stock prices soared briefly Tuesday after the Federal Reserve decided to keep interest rates steady, but the market quickly retreated as investors assessed the implications of the central bank's move.</p>
<p>Bonds also jumped at first before surrendering some of their gains, but the dollar drew sustained selling pressure.</p>
<p>Shortly after 3:40 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 40.69 points at 5,854.06 after initially gaining 35 points on the Fed's decision.</p>
<p>The decision surprised some Wall Street analysts who had expected the central bank to raise rates for the first time in 1-1/2 years. Prior to the Fed's decision, the Dow index had hovered around unchanged.</p>
<p>"I am actually very dissapointed that the Fed didn't take a golden opportunity to nudge rates up," said Graham Tanaka, President of Tanaka Capital Management. "On a pre-emptive basis it would have been a conservative route to take."</p>
<p>In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond was up 12/32 after initially rising nearly half a point, and its yield fell to 6.99 percent from 7.02 percent at Monday's close.</p>
<p>Analysts said the stock market had already priced in a quarter-point rise in interest rates. Tuesday's declines came a day after the Dow set a closing record of 5,894.74.</p>
<p>The Fed's decision, which had been anxiously awaited on Wall Street left the key federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans unchanged at 5-1/4 percent.</p>
<p>The central bank also held the discount rate, which the Fed charges banks, at 5 percent.</p>
<p>"The Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended at 1:40 p.m. (1740 GMT)," central bank spokesman Joseph Coyne said. "There is no further announcement."</p>
<p>The bland statement hid what analysts believed was one of the more contentious meetings of the policy-making committee. Anti-inflation hawks at the Fed, particularly at its regional banks, have made no secret of their desire for higher rates to cool off the economy and head off inflation.</p>
<p>Out of 55 economists surveyed in a Reuters poll, 31 had expected the Fed to hike rates on Tuesday. Some analysts said the Fed move was justified by a lack of inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Philip Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management said, "We believe the Fed's action to leave rates unchanged is fully justified given the complete absence of inflation and a noted deceleration in economic activity during the quarter to date."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dollar plunged, trading at 1.5020 German marks, down from 1.5125 marks on Monday. The currency fell to 109.20 Japanese yen vs. 109.89 yen.</p>
<p>Currency traders said the Fed's decision to hold monetary policy steady might not inflict long-term damage to the dollar because short-term interest rates were likely to head higher before the end of the year.</p>
<p>"To me the handwriting is on the wall," said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist and senior vice president at Norwest Corp. "It's a question of when (a rate hike) comes, not if it will come."</p>
<p>The upbeat dollar outlook was due to a belief that the central bank remained hawkish on inflation regardless of Tuesday's decision on rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>"I still believe they prefer to act early on the rate side if they have to and there will be enough of them that they'll have a consensus, I would believe, before the year is out," said Michael Faust, foreign exchange manager at Bailard, Biehl &amp; Kaiser.</p>
