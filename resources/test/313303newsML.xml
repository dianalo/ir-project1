<p>French publishing group Havas, which is expected to make an offer on Thursday afternoon to buy out CEP Communication minority shareholders, may propose one or 1.1 Havas shares for each CEP share or a cash premium, analysts said.</p>
<p>"Havas shares have risen more than 2.5 percent to around 400 francs, which was the last price at which CEP traded before its suspension," one analyst said.</p>
<p>"In the event of a share swap, it'd be very close to parity," another analyst agreed. Havas shares were up 2.24 percent at 397.70 francs at 1225 GMT.</p>
<p>The terms are expected to be set at Havas and CEP board meetings this afternoon, a source close to the deal said.</p>
<p>Havas declined comment.</p>
<p>It owns 73 percent of CEP. At a price of around 400 francs per share, the purchase of the remainder is expected to cost Havas just over two billion francs.</p>
<p>"The deal will not weigh heavily on Havas, which has around five billion francs of cash afer issuing four billion francs of convertible bonds in February," an analyst said.</p>
<p>Havas is expected to make an announcement after the bourse close at 1600 GMT.</p>
