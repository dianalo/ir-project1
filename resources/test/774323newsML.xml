<p>Danish bond prices opened lower on Friday  and dealers predicted a minor widening of the 10-year yield gap with  Germany but were unsure of the market direction after the afternoon's  welter of U.S. data.</p>
<p>"The 2006 benchmark should trade within a narrow 114.10-50 margin  with the 2007 in the 107.20-60 range. It is very difficult to forecast  trends due to the upcoming stream of U.S. data including July job  figures and NAPM," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The benchmark eight percent state bond due 2006 traded 0.37 point  down on Thursday's close at 114.18, yielding 5.84 percent at 0725  GMT.  </p>
<p>The seven percent 2007 bond, due to become the benchmark on September  1, slipped 0.38 point to 107.22, with yield at 6.03 percent.</p>
<p>The 2007's 10-year yield gap with Germany was unchanged from Thursday's  close at 50 basis points. The crown stood at 3.8091 per mark, firming  slightly overnight from 3.8100.</p>
