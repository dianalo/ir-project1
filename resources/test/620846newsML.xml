<p>A landmine detonated by separatist guerrillas on Wednesday injured at least nine people including five police personnel in India's Jammu and Kashmir state, police said.</p>
<p>A police spokesman said the guerrillas detonated the mine when the police vehicle was passing by near the Noorbagh area of Srinagar, summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir, injuring all policemen travelling in it.</p>
<p>Four pedestrians were also injured.</p>
<p>A Kashmiri separatist guerrilla group, Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen claimed responsibility for the incident and later circulated a statement to local newspapers thinking that the blast had killed at least six police personnel.</p>
<p>"Our Mujahideen killed at least six police personnel involved in anti-militant activities in a landmine blast near Noorbagh," the statement said.</p>
<p>Over a dozen militant groups are fighting New Delhi's rule in Jammu and Kashmir. Tehreek-ul-Mujahideen is fighting for the Himalayan state's merger with neighbouring Pakistan.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have been killed since 1990 when a revolt broke out in Jammu and Kashmir. India accuses Pakistan of training and arming Kashmiri militants, a charge denied by Pakistan.</p>
