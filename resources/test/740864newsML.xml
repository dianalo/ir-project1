<p>Philips Electronics NV said on Friday it had sold a 26.6 percent stake in Grundig, leaving it with a five percent holding.  </p>
<p>Philips said it had sold the stake to an investor group led by privately owned London based merchant bank firm Botts and Company Limited.</p>
<p>"The consideration of the shares depends on the realisable future value thereof," Philips said in a statement.</p>
<p>It added Botts had also bought the 16.4 percent stake of Grundig shares held by Hohenstaufen Vierundvierzigste Vermogensverwaltung GmbH.  </p>
<p>Philips added it was disputing the 671 million mark 1996 losses reported by Grundig. It said the stated loss had been inflated by extensive provisions for new policies adopted after the year end. This view was shared by a report from Arthur Andersen, but Philips had not reached a settlement with Grundig.</p>
<p>"Philips will therefore request the court to nullify Grundig's 1996 Annual Accounts," Philips said.</p>
<p>Philips is obliged to cover Grundig's losses up to the end of 1996.</p>
<p>"In spite of this dispute Philips continues to view Grundig as a valued business partner," it added.  </p>
<p>Finally, Philps said its negotiations with the Max Grundig Foundation had been inconclusive.</p>
<p>Last month, a Philips spokesman said Philips had begun talks with the foundation about its option to sell to Philips its 52 percent stake in Grundig for 411 million marks in 2004.</p>
<p>Philips had been investigating the possibility of selling the 52 percent interest to third parties.</p>
