<p>The German government on Tuesday stepped up liberalisation of telecommunications markets by awarding its fourth mobile telephone licence to a consortium owned by British Telecom Plc and Bavarian utility Viag AG AG .</p>
<p>Industry analysts said there was still room for a fourth player in Germany's booming mobile phone sector, expected to have over 12 million users by 2000, but the new entrant would likely set off a battle over prices that could hit profits.</p>
<p>"In the interest of consumers, current mobile phone operators Deutsche Telekom MobilNet, Mannesmann Mobilfunk and E-Plus Mobilfunk have received another competitor," said Post and Telecommunications Minister Wolfgang Boetsch.</p>
<p>The new player, E2 Mobilfunk GmbH, in which Viag holds 62.5 percent and BT 37.5 percent, was the only group to apply for the licence, but Boetsch assured it was put through a rigourous technical examination before receiving its concession.</p>
<p>E2 Mobilfunk can begin construction of the network immediately and it must make its services available to at least 75 percent of the population by the end of 2001.</p>
<p>BT and Viag have said in the past that they intended to build the network in phases. In the first stages they would concentrate on key economic centres and only later expand the network to less populated areas.</p>
<p>A key feature of the network will be to create a mixture of both wireless and fixed-wire infrastructure and services.</p>
<p>This is a current trend in the telecommunications industry as it attempts to push the limits of the types of services that can be provided over wireless networks in an effort to reduce the infrastructure costs and enhance customer mobility.</p>
<p>"Over the next few months we will step up the parallel construction of fixed-wire and mobile activities so that for the first time in Europe fixed-wire and mobile communicatiions will be integrated in a unified network," Viag said.</p>
<p>The licence sets the stage for Germany's second mobile network based on the DCS 1800 personal communications network (PCN) standard. The first PCN network is operated by the E-Plus group owned by Veba , Thyssen , BellSouth and Vodafone .</p>
<p>E-Plus received Germany's third mobile phone licence in 1993, four years later than its competitors Deutsche Telekom and Mannesmann. By the end of 1996 it had won just over 500,000 subscribers and was accessible to 90 percent of the population.</p>
<p>The company's managing director, Herbert Brehnke, told Reuters in a telephone interview in the current market a mobile phone licence was not a licence to print money.</p>
<p>"We have suffered because of our late start and now E2 will need another four years of build out and we will see if they can accomplish what we did in that time," he said.</p>
<p>With four mobile phone operators on the market, competition is expected to get tougher and companies will have a tough time differentiating themselves from their competitors.</p>
<p>"But you cannot successfully position yourself by price alone," Brehnke said. "Value for money will be decisive."</p>
<p>There are also two other digital networks based on the Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) standard.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom's D1 network has around 2.2 million subscribers. Mannesmann Mobilfunk, owned by engineering group Mannesmann AG and AirTouch Communications of the United States has around 2.3 million subscribers.</p>
<p>Mannesmann Mobilfunk announced on Tuesday that it would pay a 376 million mark ($229.1 million) dividend to its shareholders for 1996, marking the first payout in its seven-year history.</p>
<p>Industry analysts do not believe that either E-Plus or the new E2 will swing into profitablity as quickly as Mannesmann.</p>
<p>"It is late, we must admit, but there is room for a fourth licence in the German market and as competition increases the focus will turn to prices," said Thomas Deser, analyst with BHF Bank in Frankfurt.</p>
