<p>Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has accused the United States of trying to destroy the Arab people as a nation so Washington could dominate global energy markets.</p>
<p>"I believe the American capitalism creates problems and genocide campaigns and starvation," Saddam said in remarks carried by Baghdad newspapers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"As for Arabs they have to be torn to pieces as a nation, their culture and civilisation obliterated and wealth pillaged so that America would control energy markets in the world."</p>
<p>The remarks were made during a cabinet meeting in which Saddam urged his ministers to tighten their belts further.</p>
<p>Iraq is under punitive U.N. trade sanctions which the United States does not want to see lifted until Baghdad fully adheres to all the 1991 Gulf War-related resolutions.</p>
