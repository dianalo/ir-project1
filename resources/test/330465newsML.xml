<p>Marvel Entertainment Group Inc said on Friday Chief Judge Helen Balick of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware in Wilmington signed an order approving Marvel's $100 million debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing.</p>
<p>The DIP financing provided by Chase Manhattan Bank will be available to Marvel for the expected duration of its Chapter 11 reorganization and will enable the company to continue operations, Marvel said.  </p>
<p>Marvel said it is a default of the DIP agreement if anyone other than Ronald Perelman, a financier that owns 80 percent of the company, controls Marvel.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Perelman's Andrews Group said the change- of-control provision in the DIP financing agreement is the same as it was prior to Marvel's Chapter 11 filing in late December.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Marvel's creditors committee disagrees with the company's interpretation of that part of the DIP agreement. (Corrects to clarify spokesman disagrees with Marvel's interpretation.)  </p>
<p>"We strongly disagree with Marvel's highly misleading characterization of the change of control provision in the DIP," the spokesman said. "We strongly believe the DIP will not be in default if the bondholders gain control of their collateral."</p>
<p>Andrews Group's holdings of Marvel common stock serve as collateral for approximately $900 million in bonds.</p>
<p>Marvel intends to file updated financial information prior to the hearing to reflect preliminary results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 1996, including charges the company announced in November 1996.</p>
<p>The hearing on the approval of Marvel's disclosure statement is scheduled for Tuesday, January 28, 1997, the company said.</p>
<p>The confirmation hearing on Marvel's reorganization plan is scheduled for March 7, 1997, Marvel said.</p>
<p>Under that plan, Andrews Group will merge Toy Biz Inc with Marvel, but Perelman's Andrews Group will get 400 million new shares of Marvel. Marvel presently has 100 million shares outstanding.</p>
