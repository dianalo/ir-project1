<p>The Slovenian government said on Wednesday it would partly lift restrictions on the ownership of motorway petrol stations from December.</p>
<p>"In the future, potential bidders will no more have to operate three petrol stations in the country before being able to bid for motorway ones," Benjamin Lukman, head of the government's Office of European Affairs, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said restrictions would be lifted due to Slovenia's association agreement with the European Union that was signed in June.</p>
<p>Although the agreement still has to be ratified, the EU recently passed a temporary trade and cooperation agreement that will come into force in January and will be used until the association accord is enforced.</p>
<p>"Up to now restrictions were bigger because they were introduced before the association agreeement was signed," Lukman added.</p>
<p>He said petrol companies would still have to provide a supply depot in Slovenia in order to be able to bid for motorway petrol stations.</p>
<p>The change, however, will not apply to the tender for 11 motorway petrol stations that was launched earlier this year.</p>
<p>In October, Royal Dutch/Shell unit Shell Slovenia complained to the Slovenian Constitutional Court, claiming the restrictions concerning motorway petrol stations violated the constitution and the principles of free competition.</p>
<p>The Constitutional Court said it was unable to lift the restrictions of the 1996 tender as that would harm the country's ambitious motorway construction programme.</p>
<p>Slovenia aims to build 500 km (300 miles) of new motorways by the year 2004.</p>
