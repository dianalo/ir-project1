<p>Dutch brewer Heineken NV said on Friday its recent acquisitions in France, including the Fischer group, would contribute to net profits in around three years.</p>
<p>"It's difficult to give a concrete answer but we expect the acquisitions to contribute to net profit in around three years," chairman Karel Vuursteen told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said it would take time to integrate the distribution systems and brand portfolios.</p>
<p>"But we're very confident we can pull it off at the end of the day," he said. --Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000</p>
