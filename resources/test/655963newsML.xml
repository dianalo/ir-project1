<p>Romania is to build a $90 million silo in the Black Sea port of Constanta with Bouygues of France in a bid to return in force to the world grain market, an industry official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"This project is a must for Romania. We hope to complete it within two years," Gheorghe Botea, deputy general manager of the Agroexport Siloz Port Constanta (ASPC), told Reuters by telephone from Constanta.</p>
<p>"The new silo will enable Romania to increase its exports significantly."</p>
<p>He made the remarks after ASPC won a tender to build a 100,000-tonne silo in the free trade area of the port to replace a structure built in 1915. The tender was called by the administration of the free trade zone.</p>
<p>Botea said work at the project would be coordinated by ASPC and Bouygues. Each company holds a 48 percent stake in a new venture called Cereal Terminal Constanta. The rest is retained by small local firms, he said.</p>
<p>Romania expects a wheat crop of around eight million tonnes this year, compared with 3.1 million last year, and exports are seen at around 2.4 million.</p>
<p>Botea said facilities at the planned silo would allow the storage of an additional 100,000 tonnes of grain. Berths in the free trade area can accommodate Panamax ships of 30,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Good wheat crops in 1994 and 1995 of around eight million tonnes helped Romania to return as a major player on the international grain market. It sold over two million tonnes of wheat and one million tonnes of maize from its 1994 and 1995 crops.</p>
<p>But the country had problems handling exports due to limited capacity in Constanta. Inadequate internal transport, storage and export facilities compounded the difficulties.</p>
<p>The current Constanta silo has a capacity of 33,000 tonnes and operates at 6,000 tonnes a day. It can accommodate ships of a maximum 10,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Botea said financing of the $90 million project would be arranged through Romania's Bancorex SA commercial bank.</p>
<p>He said several foreign grain trading companies, including the Amsterdam-based Glencore BV, Souffle Negoce and Dreyfus of France as well as Finagrain and Continental Grain of Switzerland had shown interest in the project.</p>
<p>"We will discuss with these companies ways to increase the capital of the new Cereal Constanta Terminal," Botea said.</p>
<p>Constanta port has a strategic location at the crossroads of European and Middle East routes and is near Russian and Ukrainian markets.</p>
