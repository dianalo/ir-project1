<p>Emergency crews evacuated 81 passengers from a USAirways DC-9 on Tuesday at Boston's Logan Airport after an engine caught fire.</p>
<p>USAirways Flight 1505, which was scheduled to depart for Pittsburgh, had pulled away from the gate when the pilot "was informed there was a fire in one of the engines. The fire was extinguished," Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Arlene Salac said.</p>
<p>"The passengers were evacuated. They used the chutes. There may have been minor injuries," she added.</p>
<p>Boston Emergency Medical Services reported they were treating six people for minor injuries and evaluating two others for cardiac problems.</p>
<p>The FAA will be investigating the incident, Salac said.</p>
<p>USAirways spokesman Richard Weintraub said there were 81 passengers and a crew of five was aboard when fire was reported in the engine made by Pratt &amp; Whitney, a unit of United Technologies Corp..</p>
<p>Pratt &amp; Whitney spokesman Mark Sullivan said the company had no information on the Boston incident, but if the plane involved was a DC-9, it must have used a Pratt engine.</p>
