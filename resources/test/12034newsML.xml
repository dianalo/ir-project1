<p>United States peach growers are angry that European Union fruit and vegetables marketing reform will harm exports estimated at $40 to $50 million annually, U.S. farm officials said.</p>
<p>Californian growers are concerned that Greek and other EU peach producers will still benefit from generous subsidies and withdrawals of market surpluses and processing aid.</p>
<p>The reform, which was agreed by EU farm ministers on July 24, was aimed at raising production quality and to make fruit and vegetable growers more dependent on the market and less on public intervention stores.</p>
<p>EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler said afterwards that the reform would make EU growers more competitive.</p>
<p>"To continue to spend huge amounts of money on the destruction of surplus fruit and vegetables without any long term structural or competitive benefit to the sector would have been foolish...," he said.</p>
<p>But the Commission's proposals to reduce the attractiveness of the fruit and vegetable withdrawal system were softened after strong opposition from souther member states, notably Italy and Spain.</p>
