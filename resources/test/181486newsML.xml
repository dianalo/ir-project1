<p>Jordan has agreed to supply sanctions-hit Iraq with $35 million worth of urgently needed goods, the state news agency Petra said.</p>
<p>It said Jordan's Minister of Trade and Industry Ali Abu al-Ragheb and his Iraqi counterpart Mohammed Mehdi Saleh agreed at a meeting late on Sunday for Jordan to export vegetable oil, detergents, soap and fertiliser to Baghdad.</p>
<p>The $35 million of goods were in addition to a 1996 trade protocol under which Jordan has supplied Baghdad with $200 million of food and medicine exempted from stringent U.N. trade sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>"To ensure the continuity in flow of basic Jordanian commodities to the Iraqi market for the rest of the year the two sides agreed to allocate the sum of $35 million  to import vegetable oils, detergents, soap and fertiliser to be covered by the 1997 protocol," Petra said.</p>
<p>Trade ministry officials declined to comment on the report on Monday, but Jordanian businessmen say Iraq, hit by delays to a $2 billion oil-for-food deal, has been seeking an increase of around $50 million in next year's protocol with Jordan.</p>
<p>Under the 1996 accord, just over $200 million was deposited yearly in an escrow account at Jordan's Central Bank to pay Jordanian firms for exports of food and medicine to Iraq.</p>
<p>In return, Jordan received around 70,000 barrels of low-priced Iraqi oil per day.</p>
<p>Jordan slashed the volume of protocol trade with Iraq this year from around $400 million in 1995 after King Hussein turned against President Saddam Hussein and called for change in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Officials say that Jordan is also unwilling to increase the protocol agreement in 1997 because the system of payment for Jordanian firms drains valuable foreign currency reserves from the Central Bank.</p>
