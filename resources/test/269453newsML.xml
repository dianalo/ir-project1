<headline>Top Russia aide says fuel oil export duty due soon.</headline>

<p>A top government aide said on Friday that Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin would soon sign a document ordering that an export duty be levied on Russia's heavy fuel oil (mazut) exports.</p>
<p>"I know when he will sign the order and it will be soon," said the aide, who is close to the issue but who spoke on condition of anonymity. He declined to name the date, length or size of the tariff, saying only that it would cover what he called the cold season.  </p>
<p>The official was speaking to Reuters early on Friday.</p>
<p>Russian government officials have been wrangling for months over whether and when to impose a duty on heavy fuel oil exports.</p>
<p>The issue has been shrouded in official secrecy and has spurred many market rumours.</p>
<p>Some traders expect an export duty of up to 80,000 roubles per tonne.</p>
<p>Fuel and Energy Minister Pyotr Rodionov told Reuters in September an export duty would be levied but declined to provide details.</p>
<p>Russia raised the export tariff on mazut to 16 Ecus per tonne from six Ecus during December 1995 to March 1996 to curb deliveries abroad.</p>
<p>It banned heavy fuel oil exports outright from December 1994 to April 1995 over fears of shortfalls at home.</p>
<p>($1 = 5,542 roubles)</p>
