<p>U.S. Plains cattle markets Thursday were quiet, with packers bidding $72.00 per cwt but cattle feeders generally pricing animals at $74.00, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Sales were expected to be light Thursday.</p>
<p>"They (packers) could buy the world at $73.00, but we'll probably see more light sales at $72.00," according to one Panhandle feedlot operator. Those waiting to sell at $73.00 will probably be content to sit back and wait, knowing that more than a few cattle on showlists could use extra days on feed, he said.  </p>
<p>Packers also have adequate live inventories following last week's active sales and can afford to wait while picking up some extra loads Thursday at $72.00.</p>
<p>Packers may further be reluctant to pay higher prices for cattle as they watch boxed beef prices tumble.</p>
<p>However, the lower prices were moving boxes, sources noted.</p>
<p>Boxed beef prices Wednesday were quoted down $0.25 to $0.98 per cwt on 310 loads of fabricated cuts sold, USDA said.</p>
