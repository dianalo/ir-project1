<p>Germany's Balt Malt company will open a 40 million mark malt plant in the Polish port city of Gdansk on Friday, the firm's president said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Ryszard Zdeb told Reuters the plant would be the biggest in Poland with an annual production capacity of up to 65,000 tonnes, but the construction of the facilities enabled higher production if the need arouse.</p>
<p>"The plant will have a production capacity of up to 65,000 tonnes a year but its module system allows to achieve an annual production of 120,000 tonnes. It will be, however, possible only in three to five years," Zdeb said.</p>
<p>Zdeb also said Baltic Malt had already signed contracts with Poland's largest brewery EB in Elblag to provide malt.</p>
<p>He said 70-75 percent of the firm's production would be sold in Poland, while the rest would be exported to Russia, Belarus and Japan.</p>
<p>Zdeb said Baltic Malt's production would be based on barley bought in Poland and abroad with the share of Polish grain rising until it covered domestic demand for malt. The firm has already contracted for the output of 10,000 hectares of barley fields in nothern Poland this season.</p>
<p>Zdeb said 300,000 tonnes of malt was sold on the Polish market every year, half of which was imported. He said Baltic Malt planned to take over 30 percent of the market after it achieves full production capacity in three years.</p>
<p>Main shareholders of Baltic Malt are Friedrich Weissheimer Malzfabrik KG with 51 percent, Germany's Fund for Investment and Development with 25 percent and the International Finance Corp with 24 percent.</p>
