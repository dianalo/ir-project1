<p>Two letter bombs were found at U.N. headquarters on Monday, addressed to the U.N. bureau of the Arabic-language newspaper Al-Hayat. Both were disarmed, a U.N. spokesman said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, a letter bomb exploded at Al-Hayat's main office London wounding two security guards. Four more suspect devices were subsequently found there, British police said.</p>
<p>After the first suspicious envelope was discovered in a messenger room at U.N. headquarters, parts of two floors of the 38-story complex were closed off and the New York police bomb squad as well as the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation were called in.</p>
<p>U.N. security chief Michael McCann said the device was found to be a letter bomb and was about 15 minutes away from being delivered. It arrived at the United Nations on Friday or Saturday in a white greeting-card sized envelope.</p>
<p>It was similar to several letter bombs mailed earlier this month to the same Saudi Arabian-owned newspaper's Washington bureau. U.N. officials declined to give further details of the device, but other sources said that, like those received in Washington and London,it bore an Alexandria, Egypt, postmark.</p>
<p>"It was a live bomb and it was rendered safe in the (U.N. basement) garage," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said of the first device.</p>
<p>A few hours later he told reporters that "another letter bomb was found in the basement mail room" and that it was "very similar in format" to the first one and also addressed to Al-Hayat. The police bomb squad was again summoned.</p>
<p>Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters as he left the building, "We consider it an attack on the organization and also on freedom of press and speech. We hope that whoever has undertaken this cowardly act will cease before some serious damage is done."</p>
<p>"This is a house of peace and we work in the interest of all nations," he said, adding: This kind of activity is not something that anyone can condone and I appeal to them to desist and use other means to raise their complaints."</p>
<p>The first letter bomb, of a type which explodes when the envelope is opened, had not been detected in the basement area where mail is first sorted, but after it reached a messenger station on the second floor, Eckhard said.</p>
<p>It was addressed to Al-Hayat's bureau, not to any specific individual. The second bomb was discovered in the basement.</p>
<p>The evacuation of part of the press area resulted in a 90-minute delay in the U.N. spokesman's daily news conference.</p>
<p>A U.N. source said mail delivered to the United Nations was normally scanned as a security precaution. The precautions were stepped up after Al-Hayat's U.N. correspondent, Raghida Dergham, informed U.N. security of the London incident.</p>
<p>"We at Al-Hayat do not have any particular suspect," Dergham said. "We are going to go on with our very independent reporting," she added.</p>
<p>The FBI launched an  investigation earlier this month after eight letter bombs made to look like Christmas cards were mailed from Egypt to the United States.</p>
<p>Four arrived at Al-Hayat's Washington office and a fifth was found in the mail system. Three other devices turned up in the area around Leavenworth federal prison in Kansas.</p>
<p>Mohammad Salameh, a militant Muslim jailed for life for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, is in Leavenworth, as are Victor Alvarez and Mohammed Saleh who were convicted of plotting to blow up U.N. headquarters and other targets.</p>
