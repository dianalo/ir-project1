<p>The prosecution accused Oklahoma City bombing defendant Timothy McVeigh on Thursday of being a right-wing extremist who thought the deadly blast would trigger a second American Revolution.</p>
<p>But McVeigh's attorney, Stephen Jones, sought to counter the government's claim by saying he would prove it had accused the wrong man of blowing up the Alfred P. Murrah federal building and killing 168 people on April 19, 1995.</p>
<p>In an opening statement laying out the case against the Gulf War veteran, prosecutor Joseph Hartzler declared: "McVeigh liked to consider himself a patriot, someone who could start the second American Revolution.</p>
<p>"Our forefathers did not fight innocent women and children," he said."They didn't plant bombs and run away wearing earplugs."</p>
<p>McVeigh, who has pleaded innocent and who could face the death penalty if convicted, took copious notes during the opening statements, occasionally looking grim-faced and tense.</p>
<p>Hartzler said the prosecution would offer evidence that McVeigh created a file in his sister Jennifer's computer that talked about Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms agents.</p>
<p>"It said all you tyrannical motherf------ will swing in the wind one day for your treasonous actions against the Constitution and the United States ... die you spineless, cowardice bastards," Hartzler said, reading from the computer entry.</p>
<p>Hartzler also said surveillance tapes existed showing McVeigh's co-defendant Terry Nichols' truck in Oklahoma City on the Sunday before the bombing. The following day McVeigh was captured by a security camera at a McDonald's restaurant in Junction City, hours before he allegedly rented the Ryder truck.</p>
<p>Jones said a witness who saw a man get out of the rented Ryder truck used in the bombing described him as short, stocky and of olive complexion. McVeigh is tall and fair-skinned.</p>
<p>Jones called into question the eyewitness descriptions offered by employees at Elliott's Body Shop in Junction City, Kansas, where McVeigh allegedly rented the truck. Jones said they may have confused two other men who rented a similar truck the following day.</p>
<p>Jones also claimed the evidence collected by authorities was handled improperly. "They contaminated it, mishandled it, abused it, manipulated it and engaged in forensic prostitution."</p>
<p>The government is expected to introduce evidence about bomb residue on McVeigh's clothing. But Jones countered: "If Tim McVeigh had set that bomb, his fingernails, his nostrils, his hair, his clothing, his car, his shoes, and his socks would have it all over them and they don't.</p>
<p>"Every pancake has two sides," he said at the end of a two hour and 40 minute address to the jurors.</p>
<p>Hartzler portrayed McVeigh as a twisted patriot out to avenge the 1993 FBI assault on the Branch Davidian religious cult in Waco, Texas, which ended in the deaths of 80 people.</p>
<p>He said that prosecutors would present telephone records that trace McVeigh's activities from the time he allegedly sought to buy bomb-making materials in the fall of 1994 until the bombing.</p>
<p>But Jones told the jurors the phone cards could be used by anyone who knew the password of the account. "The card didn't carry a camera with it," Jones said.</p>
<p>After sending jurors home early for the day because of snowy weather, Federal Judge Richard Matsch ruled that some prosecution photographs will be admitted as evidence over defence objections, including a photograph of the day-care centre and another "even though it shows blood and trauma."</p>
