<p>The former co-president of Ford Models Inc has sued for a court order that would allow her to inspect the financial records of the renowned model agency, according to documents made available to Reuters Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a lawsuit filed Friday in the Delaware Chancery Court, Marion Smith said she wanted to determine "the full extent of the corporate waste...(and) the improper expenditure of corporate funds for unjustified personal perquisites."  </p>
<p>Smith, who worked for Ford Models 27 years, alleged that Ford Models' founding family members used company funds for rent, "the salaries of nannies, personal chauffeurs and other household staff."</p>
<p>According to court papers, Smith owns 1,000 shares or 16 percent of the privately-held company's stock which she bought at a discount in 1987 with a $30,000 loan from agency cofounder Gerard Ford.  </p>
<p>But in July, Ford attorney Maury Josephson of Skadden Arps alleged in a letter to Smith's attorney that Smith had forfeited her stock ownership because of an unspecified "serious breach of her employment agreement" and that her request to see the company's financial records was "an attempt to disgorge an exorbitant settlement payment by Ford."</p>
<p>Smith, who was paid $200,000 a year, resigned in September 1995 to join rival agency Company Management, taking with her several models, including supermodels Jerry Hall and Rachel Hunter.  </p>
<p>Smith's attorney, Jeffrey Rosenberg, told Reuters that the dispute began when Katie Ford, daughter of founders Eileen and Gerard Ford, took charge of the agency and allegedly "sought to emasculate all the people who had loyalty to her parents."</p>
<p>Competing lawsuits related to the employment agreement were filed by Smith and the Ford agency in New York last year and are still pending.</p>
<p>Josephson told Reuters he would not comment and calls to Ms Ford's office were referred to a spokesman who has not yet responded.</p>
<p>Andrew Freedman, spokesman for Ford Models, declined to comment on the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Ford Models is the largest model agency in the world, with offices in Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France and the United States, he said.</p>
