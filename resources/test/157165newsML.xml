<p>European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert is increasingly worried about delays in reducing the debt of Italian state holding IRI, Commission sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Speaking after a telephone conversation between Van Miert and Italian Treasury Minister Caro Azeglio Ciampi, one source said Van Miert was "very worried and very unhappy".</p>
<p>Under a 1993 deal, the European Commission established that IRI's debt should fall below five trillion lire by the end of 1996, compared with 22.46 trillion at end-1995.</p>
<p>Van Miert has already indicated that he would accept a six month delay but it is becoming increasingly obvious that this is not enough because the privatisation of telecommunications holding Stet is falling behind schedule.</p>
<p>Ciampi will be meeting Van Miert at the end of next week or the beginning of the following week. In the meantime, contacts will continue at the technical level.</p>
<p>An official in Brussels told Reuters on Tuesday that Ciampi had informed the Commission that a capital injection would probably be needed for IRI before the end of the year. He had no details of size.</p>
<p>IRI has often said the only way it can meet the terms of its EU deal is by selling off Stet. The company is slated for privatisation by March 31, 1997 but political filibustering is delaying creation of a telecoms watchdog, which must be set up before the sale goes ahead.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, IRI ruled out the sale of Telecom Italia Mobile or the transfer to the Treasury of other assets that could be privatised as a way of cutting its borrowings.</p>
