<p>The accused killers of Jonathan Levin, son of Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin, were arraigned Sunday on murder and robbery charges.</p>
<p>Corey Arthur, a 19-year-old paroled crack dealer and former student of Levin, was charged with first-degree murder. He could face the death penalty if convicted.</p>
<p>Montoun Hart, 25, was charged with second-degree murder and robbery. He faced a maximum of 25 years to life if he is convicted.</p>
<p>Both defendants were denied bail and did not enter pleas in Manhattan Criminal Court. They will be back in court on Thursday when an indictment was expected to be announced.</p>
<p>At the arraignment, Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Eugene Hurley said his office was investigating whether Hart "can and should be charged also with first degree murder."</p>
<p>According to Hart's statement to police, he agreed to go with Arthur, saying his long-time friend "made me do it at gunpoint." A source close to the case said Hart put the gun in Arthur's hand.</p>
<p>But Arthur told police he did not know Hart. He claimed that after he got to Levin's apartment, "two other men entered and one of them brandished a gun and the other brandished a knife" and they ordered Arthur to bind Levin with duct tape, which he admitted doing.</p>
<p>Arthur said he struggled with the man with the knife, ran out of the apartment and only learned later of Levin's death.</p>
<p>The criminal court complaint alleged that Arthur fired the fatal gunshot into Levin's head on May 30, at the teacher's one bedroom Manhattan apartment. It also alleged that Hart agreed to help his friend rob Levin.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Arthur used Levin's ATM card at an automatic teller machine a few blocks from Levin's apartment to withdraw $800, and Arthur's fingerprints were found on the duct tape used in the crime.</p>
<p>Levin's badly decomposed body was found by police on June 2, his ankles bound by duct tape, court papers said.</p>
<p>The New York City medical examiner said that Levin, a 31-year-old high school teacher, was stabbed in the chest and throat with a knife. Police believed he was repeatedly stabbed by the suspects to force him to reveal his bank code number.</p>
<p>Arthur, wearing a white t-shirt and baggy pants, waved and threw a kiss to his mother Penny Bostick, his stepfather and other family members in the courtroom.</p>
<p>"He's a 19-year-old boy facing the death penalty. He's very afraid, he's a very nervous young man," Anthony Ricco, the defence lawyer appointed to represent him, said after the hearing. "I saw tears in his eyes."</p>
