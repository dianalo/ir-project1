<p>People's Choice TV Corp said Monday its common stock will continue to be listed on the Nasdaq National Market because it has received a temporary exception from the net tangible assets requirement.</p>
<p>The company said the temporary exception was granted by a panel authorized by the Nasdaq Board of Governors after a hearing on June 26. The exception is subject to certain conditions.</p>
<p>In the event the company is is unable to meet the conditions, it said it expects that its common stock will be delisted from Nasdaq.</p>
<p>The company said in May it had received notice from Nasdaq that its stock would be delisted because People's Choice had negative net tangible assets as calculated under Nasdaq guidelines.  The company appealed the ruling to the special panel.</p>
