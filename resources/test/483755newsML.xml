<p>Dutch international Clarence Seedorf would be best advised to head straight back to Spain and avoid any glance at Thursday's papers in his home country.</p>
<p>The Real Madrid midfielder was singled out by the press as the man responsible for the Netherlands' shock 1-0 defeat in Wednesday's World Cup qualifier in Turkey.</p>
<p>He missed a crucial late penalty -- skying his spot-kick over the bar -- which would have maintained the Netherlands' unbeaten record in group seven.</p>
<p>The Dutch still top the group with 12 points from five matches ahead of neighbours Belgium who have nine points from four games.</p>
<p>Most commentators reckoned Seedorf should not have taken the spot kick in the first place.</p>
<p>"The Dutch left the field after the amazing 1-0 loss...with Clarence Seedorf as the big schmuck," said top-selling daily De Telegraaf.</p>
<p>The Dutch game plan for penalties was that PSV Eindhoven's Wim Jonk would take any spot-kicks, with Frank de Boer next in line.</p>
<p>When the Spanish referee awarded the late penalty for a push on substitute Pierre van Hooydonk, Jonk was not prepared to take the kick and Seedorf, standing over the ball, appeared to ignore de Boer who was asking if he was sure he wanted to have a go.</p>
<p>Coach Guus Hiddink was less than pleased that his instructions had been ignored on the night.</p>
<p>"The team should not have let Clarence take a penalty. From past experience, he's clearly not the man for the job even if he says he's feeling up to it," he said.</p>
<p>In his defence, Seedorf, who celebrated his 21st birthday on Tuesday, said he was unaware of the penalty-taking arrangements.</p>
<p>"I simply accepted responsibility, picked up the ball and took the penalty," he explained.</p>
<p>The unfortunate Seedorf is winning a reputation for spot-kick howlers, having missed the decisive penalty in the Euro 96 quarter-final shoot-out with France.</p>
