<p>Blue-chip stocks shook off a bad bear day to close in record territory Tuesday following strong gains in technology stocks, and the Nasdaq composite index racked up its ninth consecutive high close.</p>
<p>The Dow ended up 52.73 points at 7,975.71, surpassing its July 8 record finish of 7,962.31. Earlier in the session, the blue-chip index was down nearly 45 points.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq index rose 18.23 points to a new high of 1,542.11.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks also set a new high, rising 7.38 points to 925.76, as did the NYSE Composite index, up 2.88 to 480.99.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,504 to 1,345 on heavy volume of 598 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Technology stocks extended their dominance, with Hewlett-Packard Co. ranking as the Dow's strongest component for a third straight day, climbing 3-1/2 to 68-9/16.</p>
<p>Hewlett-Packard's gains again mirrored those among the resurgent technology stocks, where mounting optimism has powered Nasdaq to a string of record highs second only to a 10-session run that ended May 1, 1996.</p>
<p>In the process, investors have largely shaken off the effects of some high-profile earnings warnings early in the second quarter, most notably from Intel Corp.</p>
<p>"There is a growing conviction the group is going to do better earnings-wise later in the year and into 1998," said Al Goldman, an analyst at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons.</p>
<p>Shortly after the close, Intel reported second-quarter earnings of 92 cents a share, two cents higher than First Call's consensus analyst estimate.</p>
<p>The powerhouse performance in the tech sector appeared to breathe new life into suddenly sluggish blue chips, which have tracked sideways since nearing the 8,000 mark early last week.</p>
<p>The Dow also overcame some concerns that the soaring dollar, which has approached six-year highs against the German mark, might eventually erode profits of multinational corporations.</p>
<p>While analysts acknowledged that a high dollar could become a burden at some point, many argued that the currency also brought near-term benefits that would offset longer-term profit concerns for stocks.</p>
<p>"The dollar's rise is a two-way sword," said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Primark Decision Economics. "It hurts the profit outlook of big multinationals but valuations of our markets are helped because foreign buyers come in."</p>
<p>The dollar initially rose against the German mark, ascending to a peak of 1.8040 marks -- its highest level since August 1991 -- on fresh signs that Europe's proposed single currency will be a weak one. In later retreated to close at 1.7910 marks from 1.7955 late Monday.</p>
<p>With the quarterly earnings season in high gear, however, the market's mood is likely to shift with the tide of major earnings reports.</p>
<p>The market got an early boost from Texas Insstruments Inc., which leaped 12 points to 109-1/2 after the semiconductor giant reported earnings that more than tripled from year-ago levels.</p>
<p>The solid results boosted computer chip stocks, and the buying spread to broader tech stocks, and then, for the first time in more than a week, to the broader market, putting the Dow back in position to crack the 8,000 mark.</p>
<p>"While the techs had been strong, they were playing catch-up and now everything is finally even," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd.</p>
<p>"The market finally starts looking like it's ready to start firing on all cylinders," he said.</p>
<p>Among individual issues, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. gained 2-3/8 to 66-1/16 after it reported the highest quarterly profit in its history.</p>
<p>CCA Prison Realty Trust gained 7-7/8 to 28-7/8 in its Wall Street debut. The company is a real estate investment trust focusing on private prison properties.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 4/32, with its yield holding at Monday's close of 6.55 percent.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange index rose 2.31 to 634.94. The average NYSE share was up 28 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was at a new high 8,763.664 up 62.561 or 0.72 percent.</p>
