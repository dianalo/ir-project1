<p>Spanish energy group Repsol S.A. said on Monday that it would cut its gas prices to the public this week in all its petrol prices by up to two pesetas a litre.</p>
<p>The sharpest fall will be in 95-octane leadfree petrol, whose price will fall one to two pesetas per litre with respect to the maximum price in the week of September 7 of 112.7 pesetas a litre. Super petrol will fall about one peseta a litre.</p>
<p>"Repsol, given the large growth potential for unleaded gas in our country, has decided to push this process forward with an additional price cut in its sale prices," the group said in a statement.  </p>
<p>In the statement, Repsol said it would approve an important reorganisation of its commerical and marketing areas, which will be made public during the course of the week.</p>
