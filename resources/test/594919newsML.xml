<title>USA: Smaller companies less likely to hire black job-seekers.</title>

<p>Fewer blacks are being hired by small and mid-sized companies than by larger ones, data from a study of 3,000 employers in four big metropolitan areas reveals.</p>
<p>By contrast, larger firms -- employing 100 workers or more -- actually employ a higher percentage of blacks than are found in the population of their metropolitan areas.</p>
<p>"Big firms are looking over their shoulder," explained economist Harry Holzer of Michigan State University in East Lansing, referring to equal employment laws affecting them.</p>
<p>"They face greater risks of class-action lawsuits or 'bad press' from charges of racial bias if they hire too few blacks," he said.</p>
<p>"The really small companies, having 50 or fewer employees, seem more likely to discriminate against blacks," said Holzer, author of the study. The smallest companies, those having 15 or fewer employees, are exempted from Federal EEOC statutes.</p>
<p>"Small establishments in the suburbs serving white clientele are the least inclined to hire blacks," Holzer added.</p>
<p>"If smaller establishments hired black applicants in the same proportions as do the larger ones," he said, "there would be very substantial increases in blacks' employment and earnings," Holzer said.</p>
<p>"We really haven't done any studies ourselves," said Michael Widomski, spokesman for the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission in Washington, D.C. "But race continues to be the No. 1 basis for discrimination charges."</p>
<p>In fiscal year 1996, 34 percent of all charges filed with the EEOC -- 26,287 -- were race-based, he said.</p>
<p>"Larger companies have human resources departments and are better at focusing on equal employment issues," Widomski said. "That's not an excuse for discrimination but in a small firm you may not have somebody able to focus on human resources issues but who must deal with all aspects of the business."</p>
<p>Holzer investigated the race of job applicants and the recruitment practices of employers over two years ending May, 1994, in metropolitan Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles. In aggregate, their percentage of black residents is 17 percent.</p>
<p>"The results show a very striking tendency for the percentages of new hires and overall employment accounted for by blacks to rise with establishment size," Holzer wrote.</p>
<p>Among companies whose employees don't need a college degree, the larger the company, the greater the overall percentage of black employess, he found.</p>
<p>"The data indicate that the smallest establishments hire considerably smaller percentages of blacks than we find in the populations of these four metropolitan areas, while the largest hire somewhat more," Holzer observed.</p>
<p>"Those (businesses) in the second smallest category (21-50 employees) hire 7-10 percentage points fewer (blacks than do large companies)," he added.</p>
<p>Small establishments, Holzer pointed out, "receive fewer black applicants than do larger ones," particularly those located furthest from inner city neighbourhoods. The ratio of "black employment to applicants is 10 percent to 30 percent higher among central-city than suburban firms," he said.</p>
<p>Establishment size itself "has a large effect on the hiring of blacks," Holzer summarized, stating that this is "at least somewhat related" to differences in the impact of EEO laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The findings "strongly suggest" the need for policymakers "to revise remedies for employment discrimination at small establishments," Holzer said.</p>
