<p>Onsale Inc on Tuesday proved some companies can make a profit on the Internet as the electronic retailer and auction house posted its fifth consecutive quarterly profit.</p>
<p>The company, which went public last month, posted a first quarter net income of $52,000 on record revenues of $12.3 million for the quarter ended March 31, up from net income of $15,000 on revenue of $577,000 in the year earlier period.</p>
<p>On a per-share basis, earnings were negligible in both quarters, or $0.00 a share.</p>
<p>"We have shown five quarters of profitability so far, which validates the business model," Chief Executive Officer Jerry Kaplan told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>The company, which auctions a variety of excess goods from personal computers to audio and video equipment, will now concentrate on investing some of its public offering proceeds to grow and expand the business for the rest of this year.</p>
<p>Onsale raised $15 million in gross proceeds from the initial public offering in mid-April and its shares closed at $6.125 on Tuesday after the earnings report, which was released in the morning.</p>
<p>Kaplan said he was comfortable with Wall Street analyst estimates that the company would break even over the course of 1997 as it increases its prominence on the Internet through online advertising and partnerships with other sites, as well as building up its capabilities on the merchandising side.</p>
<p>"It is a very good business decision going forward to accelerate the growth in business by investing some of the proceeds in the IPO," he said. "Next year we return to the model."</p>
<p>Kaplan said the company, which conducts 24-hour auctions three times a week, is active currently with more than 100 manufacturers, distributors, brokers, refurbishers, direct marketers and retailers.</p>
<p>"Despite these gains, growth in consumer demand continues to outstrip supply at our auctions," he said.</p>
<p>Montgomery Securities Tuesday initiated coverage of Onsale with a "Buy" rating, saying it has a price target of $10-$12 based on a market capitalization to revenue analysis.</p>
<p>In a market note, Montgomery analysts said Onsale is expected to post a per-share loss of $0.03 this year and a $0.38 a share profit in 1998, while merchandise revenue is due to rise to $101 million in 1997 and $212 million in 1998.</p>
