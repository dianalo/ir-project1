<p>Zebra Technologies Inc said Friday it expected its gross margins to hold steady after reaching its highest in two years during the third quarter.</p>
<p>Late Thursday, the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings of $0.36 a share on sales of $43.8 million, compared with EPS of $0.04 and $37.5 million in sales in the third quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>Zebra, which supplies bar code technology, reported a gross margin of 49 percent for the most recent quarter.  </p>
<p>"I think it is sustainable...assuming there are no huge changes in price levels in the industry," said Randy Whitchurch, Zebra's chief financial officer.</p>
<p>"I'm not going to tell you to expect them (gross margins) to continue to go upward, but I wouldn't tell you to take them down either," he said in a conference call with analysts.</p>
<p>In second quarter, the company said its gross margin was 47.9 percent. The last time it reached 49 percent was in the fourth quarter of 1994, Whitchurch said.</p>
<p>He said the rise reflected increased software sales, products with higher prices and expanded levels of operations.  </p>
<p>"This is a very solid gross margin figure with no funny money," Whitchurch said.</p>
<p>Zebra said it cut spending as a result of disappointing results in the first half of the year. The company said the spending changes would not hurt key product development.</p>
<p>"The net effect of our sales growth, gross margin expansion and reduction of operating spending was an increase in operating margins to 27.3 percent and a new record in the level of operating profits," said Ed Kaplan, chairman and chief executive officer of Zebra, in the conference call.     "This</p>
<p>gets back to the traditional levels we saw last year."</p>
<p>Shares of Zebra were trading up 2-3/16 to 28 at 1320 EDT/1720 GMT Friday.</p>
