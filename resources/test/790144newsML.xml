<p>The antitrust division of the U.S. Justice Department raised no objections to News Corp Ltd's acquisition of Heritage Media Corp, News said Friday.</p>
<p>News Corp said the government informed both companies late Thursday. News said Heritage will hold a special meeting of shareholders on August 11 to formally consider the proposed deal. If approved, the transaction's closing "is expected shortly thereafter," News said.</p>
<p>On July 28, the companies said the Justice Department was considering challenging the $1.35 billion stock-and-debt deal.  </p>
<p>Heritage provides in-store marketing products, such as merchandising coupons.</p>
<p>News Corp, a giant media and entertainment company, also operates a business that provides merchandise coupons in newspapers and a smaller business that provides them in stores.</p>
<p>Separately, Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc, said it still expects to complete its proposed acquisition of Heritage's six television stations and 24 radio stations in the first quarter of 1998. That $630 million deal is subject to the completion of the News Corp deal and government approval.</p>
