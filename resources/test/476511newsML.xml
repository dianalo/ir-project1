<p>Italy on Tuesday pressed on with preparing a multinational security force to deploy in lawless Albania and tried to ease strained relations by calling for a joint Rome-Tirana inquiry into the sinking of a refugee boat.</p>
<p>"The government wants to clear this up completely...so that no shadow of a doubt remains," Prime Minister Romano Prodi told reporters. "I am in favour of a bilateral Italo-Albanian effort to clarify thoroughly the facts."</p>
<p>Grief and anger throughout Albania cast a shadow over Italy's plan to lead a force of about 2,500 troops or police to protect deliveries of food and medicines in the Balkan state, which has been racked by armed unrest for three months.</p>
<p>One key point of deployment is Vlore, the Adriatic port where the ill-fated refugees set out on Friday. Residents in the town have vowed revenge if Italian troops arrive.</p>
<p>More than 80 Albanians were feared drowned in a collision between their boat and an Italian navy ship. Four bodies were recovered and 34 people rescued. Italy has ruled out finding anyone else alive.</p>
<p>Survivors accused the Italian navy of ramming their vessel to stem a flood of refugees after about 13,000 fled across the Adriatic in March. Italy says those leaving now are fleeing for economic reasons and do not qualify for political asylum.</p>
<p>Prodi said that the incident must not be allowed to taint previously close ties and his government has insisted that the tragedy makes the mission ever more urgent to stem a tide of refugees.</p>
<p>Rome, with U.N. backing, will lead the force which will secure Tirana airport, the ports of Vlore and Durres and protect relief convoys around the country of 3.4 million people.</p>
<p>Greece will contribute about 700 soldiers, Spain 500 and Romania 400. France, Portugal, Austria and Turkey have also expressed willingness to take part.</p>
<p>In Washington, the United States said it would not take part in the multinational force but would consider requests to support it.</p>
<p>Much of southern Albania is in rebel hands after violent protests against the collapse of popular savings schemes this year turned into open insurrection. Looting is rife and most foreign nationals have been evacuated from Albania.</p>
<p>Dutch diplomat Jan de Marchant et d'Ansembourg, the head of a European Union mission planning aid and security for Albania, said advance units were not likely before the end of the week.</p>
<p>Reports of random violence, mostly by outlaw gangs, resumed around the country after an Easter holiday lull at the weekend.</p>
<p>A rebel-held army munitions depot was in flames near the southern town of Gjirokaster and explosions could be heard in the town three kms (two miles) away, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The shops of the Vefa investment company, often associated with the failed pyramid schemes, were looted in the southern town of Berat.</p>
<p>Government-controlled police units tried to return to Berat but were chased out again over the weekend by armed gangs. The state ATA news agency said the town was still gripped by fear, with residents defending the apartment blocks at night.</p>
