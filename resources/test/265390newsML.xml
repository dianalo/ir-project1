<p>Greek stocks added more gains to Tuesday's 1.03 percent climb with trading volume boosted by block trades. It was another strong showing by banks with construction leading the advance and industrials also firmer.</p>
<p>"It's a year end rally which could fizzle out around 960 points. But if confidence returns the market could be in for a sustained advance -- the ingredients are here," said a floor trader.</p>
<p>On Tuesday National Economy Minister Yannos Papandoniou told Reuters Television that December inflation would ease from November's 7.7 percent despite the farmers' blockade and would fall substantially in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>"The government is pulling a rabbit out of a hat. How can inflation be falling so dramatically when farmers are blocking supply and the holidays are raising demand? Is the recession so deep?" said ING Barings in a report.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the farmers' blockade went into its 21st day with farmers threatening to demonstrate in Athens on Thursday. Prime Minister Costas Simitis is locked into a bitter fight with the nation's farmers, once the backbone of the socialist PASOK party.</p>
<p>He has repeatedly refused to bow to their demands.</p>
<p>Ergobank shares gained 245 drachmas or 1.95 percent on Wednesday to close at 12,800 drachmas after shareholder approval for a 26.5 billion drachma rights issue set for January 27.</p>
<p>Rights entitle shareholders to seven new shares for every 20 held at 4,000 drachmas.</p>
<p>"The terms translate to a 20 percent discount which is on the high end. It was a procedural victory for management against a dissenting shareholder. The stock should react with strength but some longer term strategic questions remain," ING Barings said.</p>
<p>The Athens general share index closed up 0.85 percent or 7.79 points higher at 924.79 from Tuesday's 917.00 close after opening at 917.21. Trading volume jumped to 16.75 billion drachmas on volume of 4.08 million shares.</p>
<p>The Merrill Lynch call spread warrant on OTE with a strike price of 3,800 drachmas was quoted at 550-568. Shares of OTE telecom, the underlying, ended 10 drachmas lower at 4,200.</p>
<p>The recently launched ING Baring Financial Products American style call warrant based on a basket of six bank stocks was quoted at $7.83-$8.83. The strike price is set at $99.6 and the warrants expire October 8, 1997.</p>
<p>The Morgan Stanley Hellenic Blue Chip Warrant, which has a strike price of 100 marks, was quoted at 3,163-3,355 drachmas in early trade.</p>
