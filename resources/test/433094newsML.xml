<p>Following are comments from economists and analysts on Brazil's $2.031 billion trade deficit in the period of January and February.</p>
<p>ODAIR ABATE, chief economist at Lloyds Bank, Brazil: "The figure was in line with market expectations. Considering January's $413 million trade gap, Brazil posted a trade deficit of $1.6 billion last month as many projected."  </p>
<p>Abate said he expects the trade balance to improve in March as some exports, particularly of commodities, are being brought forward.</p>
<p>"It is possible that the March trade balance will improve because exports of commodities expected for April are being brought forward," he said.</p>
<p>Despite an expected improvement in exports, the March trade balance is likely to show a deficit at between $500 million and $700 million, bringing the deficit for the first quarter to $2.5-$2.7 bln.  </p>
<p>For the whole year of 1997, Abate predicts Brazil will show a trade deficit of $8.0 billion.</p>
<p>NILSON TEIXEIRA, economist at Banco Fonte Cindam: "The figure was widely expected and confirms projections of a $7.5 billion to $8 billion trade deficit for the entire year."</p>
<p>Teixeira said Brazil will show a trade deficit again in March, only returning to the black in April or May. He said exports will increase this month but not enough to compensate high imports of capital goods, electronic goods and fuel.  </p>
<p>THOMAS MALAGA, chief economist at private bank Unibanco: "Nobody was caught by surprise but we cannot say this is a comfortable figure. We are talking about $1.0 billion deficit a month."</p>
<p>He said he expects Brazil to continue showing trade deficits of some $600 million between March and June, but he noted it is possible that the trade balance will improve in May as exports of key commodities increase.</p>
<p>"This is the peak period for exports of soybeans, orange juice and coffee," he said.</p>
<p>Malaga said a continued trade deficit is not worrisome as long as foreign investment keeps growing to finance the country's current account deficit.</p>
