<p>Quebecor Printing Inc expects stronger profits in 1997, despite a slip in first-quarter earnings, company officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>"I see this as temporary. The company is very comfortable with its earnings expectations (for) this year," President Charles Cavell told a news conference after the company's annual meeting.</p>
<p>Cavell would not make a specific quarter-by-quarter earnings forecast, but when asked if he expected profits for full year 1997 to be ahead of 1996, replied: "Yes."  </p>
<p>"Our bookings for the back end of the year are already very, very strong," Cavell said.</p>
<p>At the meeting, Quebecor Printing said that first-quarter net earnings fell to to US$17.1 million or US$0.15 a share from year earlier US$19.3 million or US$0.17 a share.</p>
<p>Sales rose to US$786.9 million from US$736.1 million.</p>
<p>Quebecor Printing attributed the profit decline to the acquisition of AmerSig Graphics Inc in the United States and the ongoing restructuring of its recent acquisitions in France, where it said market conditions were "difficult."  </p>
<p>Cavell said he expected the consolidation of operations at AmerSig to translate into stronger operating results by the end of the year. The company expects to close AmerSig's Dallas plant by July and transfer certain employees and equipment to existing Quebecor Printing facilities in Dallas or elsewhere.</p>
<p>Commenting on Quebecor Printing's share price performance, Chief Financial Officer Michel Salbaing said the company was not planning to issue equity or split its stock.</p>
<p>"At this point in time, in none of our financing or none of our needs do we see the need for equity financing that would dilute the position of existing shareholders," he said.  </p>
<p>Company officials said Quebecor Printing continues to be on the lookout for acquisitions, but its priority this year is to digest acquisitions made earlier in France and the United States.</p>
<p>"The company is and will continue to be a growth company," Cavell said.</p>
<p>"We've made some very major steps, both in Europe and America, and we are more focused now on consolidating and getting the efficiency in our earnings back to where we like them," he said.</p>
<p>The company is scouting opportunities in Italy and Eastern Europe, and is looking at entering the South American market, Cavell said.</p>
<p>Quebecor Printing will not abandon any of its product lines, which include the printing of magazines, inserts, books and catalogues. Through AmerSig, the company has significantly heightened its presence in the North American catalogue market, and would like to get involved in Europe's book printing sector, he said.</p>
