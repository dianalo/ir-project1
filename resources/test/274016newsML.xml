<p>Shipping and road transport group Koninklijke Nedlloyd NV said on Monday it intends to transfer its 30.56 percent stake in Europe Combined Terminals (ECT) to its joint venture P&amp;O Nedlloyd Container Line Ltd.</p>
<p>Other shareholders in ECT are Internatio-Mueller NV, Koninklijke Pakhoed and the state-owned Dutch Railways.</p>
<p>These firms have a right of first refusal in case one of the co-owners sells its interest but the three firms have already agreed to transfer the stake to the joint venture with Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation, Nedlloyd said.</p>
<p>Nedlloyd intends to transfer its ECT stake to its subsidiary Nedlloyd Lijnen BV before December 31 of this year. At or around January 1, Nedlloyd Lijnen will be merged into P&amp;O Nedlloyd Container Line Ltd.</p>
<p>Last week, Nedlloyd's shareholders approved the container shipping division merger with P&amp;O after the European Commission had already given the green light to the transaction.</p>
