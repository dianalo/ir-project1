<p>U.S. officials said on Tuesday that they called off negotiations with Britain for a new "open skies" aviation agreement after receiving what they said was a disappointing offer from London.</p>
<p>The U.S. decision to call off talks scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday in Washington surprised London and cast doubt over a proposed alliance between British Airways and American Airlines.</p>
<p>"The U.K. proposal that was provided fell so far short of providing the essential elements of an open skies agreement, it did not provide the basis for discussion," U.S. Transportation Department spokesman Bill Mosley said.</p>
<p>He said the two sides remained in touch and that the United States was ready to resume negotiations if "the basis for productive talks can be developed."</p>
<p>Another U.S. official said the ball was in Britain's court to resume talks on the open skies agreement.</p>
<p>"Our impression after reading their proposal is either they don't want an agreement or they don't want one soon," said a U.S. official who asked not to be identified. "They don't appear yet to have bought into the open skies concept."</p>
<p>U.S. approval of the proposed alliance between British Airways and American is conditioned on a new agreement that removes restrictions on flights to London's Heathrow airport. U.S. officials have said such an agreement was necessary before the proposed controversial alliance could be granted antitrust immunity.</p>
<p>British Airways shares fell Tuesday after the talks were called off. Shares of AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, were unchanged in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>In London, British officials expressed surprise at the U.S. decision to cancel talks.</p>
<p>"We are quite surprised at their reaction to our proposals, which we thought went quite a long way towards opening access to Heathrow," said a Department of Transport spokeswoman.</p>
<p>She declined to say whether this spelled the end of the latest attempt in five years of abortive meetings to get an agreement.</p>
<p>"The two sides remain in touch," she said.</p>
<p>The United States is looking for an agreement with Britain identical to one signed with Germany in May, a U.S. official said.</p>
<p>Specifically, the United States wants access for all U.S. carriers to Heathrow airport, Europe's most popular airport. A major hurdle in the talks are U.S. demands for rights for its carriers to fly from Britain to third countries.</p>
<p>Pricing and ground handling are also major issues, a U.S. official said.</p>
<p>Previous efforts at getting open skies have foundered on the Heathrow issue and demands by Britain for the United States to lift its 25 percent ceiling on foreign ownership of its airlines.</p>
<p>American Airlines had no immediate comment on the latest development.</p>
<p>Last month, company officials indicated they would look for an alternative major European airline with which to form an alliance if the British Airwayd deal fell through. Company officials have said they could reopen talks with Air France .</p>
