<p>Russia's Black Sea oil ports of Novorossiisk and Tuapse are shut to tanker traffic because of high winds and swell, a shipping source said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Novorossiisk, the largest export terminal of Russian crude oil, has been shut since 1320 local hours on Tuesday as winds rose to Gale Force 8 and swell rose up to three metres high.</p>
<p>The smaller Tuapse terminal has been closed since late Tuesday.</p>
<p>There were four crude oil tankers and one small fuel oil vessel at anchor at Novorossiisk on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At Tuapse, there were five products tankers -- one loading naphtha and four to load gas oil -- at anchor on Wednesday.</p>
<p>All other Russian oil outlets in the Black Sea and the Baltic were operating normally, the source said.</p>
