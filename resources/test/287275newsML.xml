<p>Former Leeds and Sheffield Wednesday manager Howard Wilkinson is expected to be formally announced as the first technical director of the English Football Association (F.A.) on Monday.</p>
<p>The 53-year-old Yorkshireman will work alongside England manager Glenn Hoddle overseeing the development of soccer at grass-roots level.</p>
<p>A former school-teacher, Wilkinson has also worked as a non-league manager, an F.A. regional coach, an assistant manager of the England Under-21 side and chairman of the League Managers' Association.</p>
<p>He guided Leeds to the English league title in 1992 but was sacked by the Elland Road club this season after a series of poor results.</p>
