<p>Prices of Russian MinFin bonds firmed slightly on Wednesday on cautious buying by both Russian and Western operators, with the market awaiting the outcome of President Boris Yeltsin's heart operation, dealers said.</p>
<p>The bypass operation is due at the end of September.</p>
<p>		 tranche  Sept 11		 Sept 10</p>
<p> 1999 maturity (3)    75.80-76.05	   75.60-75.85</p>
<p> 2003 maturity (4)    48.75-49.00	   48.65-48.90</p>

<p>"Both Russian and foreign operators were buying in early trading but then prices eased back when two London operators started selling, probably on client offer," Sberbank dealer Pavel Sool said.</p>
<p>An ICFI Moscow Partners dealer said: "Trading is not active, the West seems to be waiting for the results of Yeltsin's operation, while Moscow operators are a bit more active."</p>
<p>Dealers said the most actively traded third, fourth and fifth tranches were fluctuating in the ranges of 75.50-76.20, 48.50-49.20 and 31.50-32.20 respectively.</p>
