<p>Pakistan expelled an Indian High Commission (embassy) official on Tuesday accusing him of spying in an apparent tit-for-tat move between the two arch rivals, spokesmen of both sides said.</p>
<p>A Pakistan Foreign Ministry spokesman the official from the non-diplomatic staff, A,C. Sinha, had been caught "red-handed" receiving sensitive information from a source and had been told to leave the country by October 4.</p>
<p>Earlier an Indian High Commission spokesman said the official was formally accused of involvement in "activities incompatible with his status", a diplomatic euphemism for spying.</p>
<p>In previous years, Pakistan and India have often expelled each other's diplomats or other officials in trading spying charges.</p>
<p>On Monday, India said it had expelled a Pakistani diplomat, Nur Mohammad Mattoo, on a similar charge as the two sides also traded charges of kidnapping one another's diplomats, as they had often done in previous years of their bitter relations.</p>
<p>The Indian mission official said Sinha was kidnapped outside his home in Islamabad by 15 Pakistani intelligence agents on Monday morning and was released about 15 hours later.</p>
<p>The Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi said in a statement on Monday that it had protested to the Indian foreign ministry after Indian intelligence agents abducted the Pakistani diplomat in Delhi on Saturday and kept him in illegal detention for 16 hours.</p>
<p>Both sides have rejected the spying charges.</p>
<p>India and Pakistan have fought three wars since their independence from British rule in 1947, two of them over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir.</p>
