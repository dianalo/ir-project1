<p>Spain's ruling party proposed measures to revamp the jury system on Tuesday after the acquittal of a man who admitted killing two policemen sparked a national outcry.</p>
<p>The conservative Popular Party (PP), stunned by last week's verdict, said it wanted to ban the use of juries in cases where intimidation was possible and ease some of the burden on jurors' shoulders by leaving the final decision to judges.</p>
<p>"The PP proposes to exclude (cases of) murders or other crimes committed against the authorities and its agents and public servants," Andres Ollero, the PP's justice spokesman, told a news conference.</p>
<p>A Basque jury of eight women and one man acquitted Mikel Otegi on Thursday on the grounds that he was not responsible for his actions when he killed two officers with a shotgun at a farm in Itsansondo in northern Spain in 1995.</p>
<p>Otegi, 23, had confessed to the killings but said in his defence that he had been drunk and suffered a mental blackout at the time.</p>
<p>Basque officials and judges said they suspected jurors had acquitted Otegi, an alleged member of radical youth group Jarrai with links to separatist guerrillas ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom), for fear of reprisals.</p>
<p>The government vowed to review Spain's fledgling jury system to avoid a similar outcome.</p>
<p>The case outraged Basque citizens and judicial circles and prompted calls for a ban on juries, a relatively new concept introduced in Spain in 1995.</p>
<p>The PP's changes, proposed in Congress, would also step up protection for jurors and increase avenues for appeals.</p>
<p>The Justice Ministry said it had also begun examining possible ways to reform jury laws and said the government was keen to set changes in place before the summer.</p>
<p>Otegi's case is not the first hiccup since juries were reintroduced after being banned by fascist dictator General Francisco Franco in 1936.</p>
<p>Last November, a Madrid jury found a young man not guilty after he had confessed to stabbing and killing his brother after an argument over a pair of jeans.</p>
<p>Justice experts said a professional court would have put him behind bars for involuntary murder.</p>
<p>But Otegi's verdict was politically sensitive, experts said.</p>
<p>The case had been surrounded by controversy from the start due to difficulties in finding jurors for fear of violent retribution by ETA.</p>
<p>Thousands of people including Basque police, employees of the court and the dead officers' families, marched through the streets of the Basque city of San Sebastian on Monday to protest against the acquittal.</p>
<p>"We need and demand justice...This shameful verdict has left the families devastated. It is as if our sons had been killed for the second time," the mother of one the dead officers said on local radio.</p>
