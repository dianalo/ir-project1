<p>The countries of Mercosur, the South American customs union, will finalize a free trade deal with Bolivia in a few days, Brazil's minister of external relations said.</p>
<p>"We are just a few days away from clinching a final deal ... It's a good free-trade deal with Bolivia," Brazil's Luiz Felipe Lampreia told an audience of businessmen and diplomats gathered here.</p>
<p>He added that a similar deal with Chile has already been achievied. Although technically Bolivia and Chile are not full members of Mercosur, they are taking part in all discussions to develop the South American free-trade zone, Lampreia said.</p>
