<p>Republic Industries Inc., moving to expand its automotive business, said Thursday it would acquire Alamo-Rent-A-Car Inc. in a deal valued at $625 million.</p>
<p>Republic Industries is a diversified company led by businessman Wayne Huizenga that specialises in electronic security, solid waste and cars. The move follows the September collapse of Republic's planned acquisition of security firm ADT Ltd.</p>
<p>Terms of the Alamo transaction were not immediately available. The companies said the deal will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.</p>
<p>Huizenga said said Republic's AutoNation USA car business will benefit from Alamo's strong relationships with manufacturers and other automotive suppliers.</p>
<p>"The combination of Alamo with Republic's 'like-new' automobile retailing concept is an exceptional fit that will enable AutoNation USA to accelerate its business plan and create a unique, dedicated and predictable source of inventory for our megastore distribution system," Huizenga said in a statement.</p>
<p>Alamo is the fourth-largest rental car company in the United States, with a fleet of about 130,000 vehicles. Alamo operates in 42 states in the United States and has operations in 10 European countries and Canada.</p>
<p>Michael Egan, chairman and founder of Alamo, will continue as chairman, the companies said.</p>
<p>Republic's stock was up $2.125 to $32.875 on Nasdaq in afternoon trading after earllier gaining $2.50.</p>
<p>The deal is subject to customary conditions including the receipt of all required regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Republic abandoned a $4.3 billion bid for Boca Raton, Fla.-based ADT in September after the two companies were unable to agree on terms of a deal, partially due to the volatility of Republic's stock.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, ADT said it planned to sell its U.S. auto-auction business, ADT Automotive. The unit is the nation's second-largest automobile auction company, and its sale would mark ADT's complete exit from that business after it sold its European auto-auction unit last year.</p>
