<p>UK chemicals group Courtaulds Plc said on Monday it is in settlement discussions with Austrian fibres producer Lenzing AG over the cross licensing of their patent portfolios.</p>
<p>"These discussions have now reached an advanced stage," the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The two companies have filed numerous patent applications over their respective Lyocell technologies, many of which have already been granted.</p>
<p>Earlier, Lenzing said that a U.S. court in Washington had decided in its favour in its Lyocell patent dispute with Courtaulds and confirmed Lenzing's patent in the United States.</p>
<p>The Federal Court of Appeal reversed a summary decision by the New York District Court in November 1995 which ruled the patent invalid for not disclosing the "best mode" of invention.</p>
<p>Lenzing claimed infringement of the patent by Courtaulds at its Lyocell plant in Mobile, Alabama, while Courtaulds denied the infringements and asserted that the patent was invalid.</p>
<p>The patent, confined to the United States, is in respect of one process step in the manufacture of lyocell fibre.</p>
<p>"This decision should be kept in perspective," said David Wilkinson, Courtaulds director responsible for fibres.</p>
<p>"Lyocell fibre has huge potential and both companies are working towards a final settlement of their differences which will in future allow them to concentrate their energies on developing Lyocell's market potential to the full".</p>
