<p>Fans and the music industry on Saturday lamented the death of controversial rap star Tupac Shakur, who died six days after being shot in a gangland-style ambush.</p>
<p>The rapper's short and explosive life ended on Friday at University Medical Centre in Las Vegas, where he had been in critical condition since the shooting near the famed Las Vegas strip on September 7.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old singer and actor's death was due to "respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest," the hospital said. Surgeons removed his right lung last Sunday.</p>
<p>The death of Shakur, one of the most controversial performers of hardcore "gangsta" rap, saddened and shocked the fans who had snapped up millions of his records.</p>
<p>His fellow rap star Coolio said: "Despite some of his shortcomings, he always gave you something with his music. He gave you something to think about or he gave you something to laugh about or he gave you something to cry about."</p>
<p>Civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson, who prayed with Shakur's mother at the rapper's bedside last Sunday, told the Los Angeles Times, "This is so, so sad. Sometimes the lure of violent culture is so magnetic that even when one overcomes it with material success, it continues to call. He couldn't break the cycle."</p>
<p>Shakur was best known for raw lyrics laced with violence, sex and profanity describing life in the black ghetto. His latest album, "All Eyez on Me," released this year, celebrated his outlaw image and sold several million copies.</p>
<p>The rap star's life often mirrored the violence portrayed in his music. Last Saturday a gunman in a white Cadillac opened fire on Shakur's car as he drove with friends to a Las Vegas nightclub after watching the Mike Tyson-Bruce Seldon world heavyweight title fight. Shakur was hit four times.</p>
<p>Police made no arrests and said they had no suspects, no motive and no leads. Las Vegas police spokesman Phil Roland described Shakur's death as "a tragic loss of life" and said it did not help the investigation, which has now turned into a murder probe. "He was going to be one of our key witnesses," Roland said. Roland appealed to witnesses of the shooting to come forward.</p>
<p>Dozens of fans, who gathered outside University Medical Centre in Las Vegas on Friday evening, told how Shakur's music struck a chord with them because it reflected urban realities.</p>
<p>Nathan Byrd, an 18-year-old Las Vegas high school student, said what he liked about Shakur's music was "the way he brings reality out in words. He's telling the truth."</p>
<p>Adrian Parker, 17, also a high school student, theorised that "somebody got to him because he was being successful."</p>
<p>Shakur was beloved by fans and reviled by conservative politicians for songs that celebrated violence and misogyny. But some of his work had a compassionate side and contained positive messages about women and fatherhood, critics said.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Times said Shakur's death, coupled with the recent departure of talented producer Dr. Dre, added to the woes of Death Row Records, the successful record label that Shakur recorded for. It quoted a music industry executive as asking whether a relatively small label could afford to lose such major players.</p>
<p>Death Row co-founder Marion "Suge" Knight, 31, was in the car with Shakur and suffered a minor injury in the shooting.</p>
<p>Shakur starred in several movies, including "Juice" and "Poetic Justice" with Janet Jackson. On August 30 he finished filming "Gang Related," an urban crime thriller in which he plays a detective. The movie was due for release next year.</p>
<p>"We all felt he had a really bright future. He was really proud of the film he was making ... It's sad he won't be able to see his work," John Bertolli, a producer of the film, said.</p>
<p>Shakur, who lived in Los Angeles, was rarely out of trouble, spending much of the last 2 1/2 years in court, prison or hospitals.</p>
<p>In November 1994 he was shot five times while being robbed of $40,000 in jewels in the lobby of a Manhattan recording studio. In February 1995 he was sentenced to prison for involvement in a sexual attack on a 21-year-old woman in a New York hotel room. He spent eight months behind bars until he was released pending his appeal.</p>
