<p>Greek bonds were trading down late on Friday, especially FRNs 2000 and 2004, depos and swaps were stable and ecu/drachma was firmer with purchases of ecus for drachmas from Greek and foreign investors, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Bonds were down on sales from foreign investors because of a pan-European selling pressure on high-yield markets. Floaters 2004 were trading 40 basis points lower and fixed coupon bonds 2000 were down 30 basis points," a bond dealer at a foreign bank said.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Nikos Christodoulakis said Greece would auction about 200 billion drachmas of long-term bonds in March to cover expiries.</p>
<p>There are expiries of about 126 billion drachmas in early March and 80 billion drachmas at the end of the month, he said.</p>
<p>Long-term bonds could be seven-year FRNs, three-year fixed coupon bonds or five-year coupon bonds.</p>
<p>Greece has never issued or auctioned a five-year coupon bond in the past.</p>
<p>"The market did not react to the finance ministry's statement for an auction and the likely issuance of a five-year coupon bond because it had discounted the news," the bond dealer said.</p>
<p>Greek M3 money supply grew provisionally 13.8 percent year-on-year in January from 9.0 percent in December, overshooting the central bank's 6.0-9.0 percent target range for end-97.</p>
<p>"This is another disturbing fact for money market rates and consequently bonds," he added.</p>
<p>Another bond dealer, the fall in bond prices followed an earlier drop in the bourse, which closed down 4.65 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>Sales of T-bills expiring on Friday did not cover expiries of 500 billion drachmas, dealers said.</p>
<p>Depos and forex forwards were stable a state-bank dealer said.</p>
<p>"Money market rates were steady late on Friday and the Bank of Greece's intervention rate was held constant. Deposits and swaps were therefore stable," a dealer at a state bank said.</p>
<p>The central bank kept its intervention rate in overnight money unchanged at 11.90 percent.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 156.75/85 from Friday's 156.840 fix, the dollar at 265.27/37 drachmas from 265.500 and the Ecu at 304.42/52 from 304.360 drachmas.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece, the domestic money market's biggest player, quoted the following late rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at 11.45-11.95</p>
<p>** T/N at 11.45-11.95</p>
<p>** S/N at 11.45-11.95</p>
<p>** One week at 11.45-11.95</p>
<p>** Two weeks at 11.45-11.95</p>
<p>** Three weeks at 11.45-11.95</p>
<p>** One month at 11.45-11.95</p>
<p>** Two months at 11.35-11.85</p>
<p>** Three months at 11.25-11.75</p>
<p>** Six months at 11.00-11.50</p>
<p>** Nine months at 10.90-11.40</p>
<p>** Twelve months at 10.80-11.30</p>
