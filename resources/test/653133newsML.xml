<p>Indonesian automobile maker PT Astra International said on Wednesday it will launch a compact Asia Family Car in the first quarter of 1998 with 40 percent local components.</p>
<p>"We will launch the Asia Family Car (AFC) in the first quarter 1998," finance director Rini Suwandi told reporters after the annual shareholders meeting.</p>
<p>Suwandi said the car would be produced by Toyota Astra Motor, a joint venture between Japan's Toyota Motor and Astra and would be marketed in the region, not only the domestic market.</p>
<p>In 1998, the company planned to launch two new models of Daihatsu sedans and one new model of an Isuzu car, she said.</p>
<p>However, Suwandi declined to indicate the price range and any likely impact on Astra's earnings.</p>
