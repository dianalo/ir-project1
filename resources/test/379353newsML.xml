<headline>Dlr stands its ground in Europe after buoyant week.</headline>

<p>The dollar ended little changed in Europe compared with Thursday's close here, underpinned by robust U.S. asset markets but wary of any central bank response to an extension of this week's sharp rally to multi-year highs.</p>
<p>The week closed on a quiet note as U.S. markets were expected to wind down early ahead of a long weekend there. Monday is President's Day.</p>
<p>A slew of U.S. economic data did little to change the underlying picture for the dollar, while further signs of weakness in the German economy and vigilance from other central banks around Europe kept traders wary of the mark.  </p>
<p>At 1555 GMT, the dollar was trading at 1.6860/65 marks compared with Thursday's close here at 1.6870/75 marks. Against the yen, it was at 124.10/20 compared with 124.28/33 late yesterday.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen motored higher to a new four-year high at 124.82 earlier but trepidation about Bank of Japan intervention to sell dollar's on any move through the psychological 125.00 level allowed profit-takers to pull it off the highs in Europe.</p>
<p>All the signals from Germany and Japan continued to show how hamstrung the authorities there are in countering currency weakness with anything other than token intervention.  </p>
<p>In Japan, rumblings about the health of the financial sector there continued. Although the latest data showed company bankruptcies in January were down 3.3 percent from December, they are still up 9.5 percent year-on-year while total debt was up 12.6 percent from December.</p>
<p>In Germany, retail sales fell a real 3.2 percent month-on-month and was down 4.4 percent on the year.</p>
<p>German government bond futures hit a new record high in early trading as long-term yields fell further there, bolstering the dollar's yield advantage over the mark.</p>
<p>Official concern with the weaker mark was also muted.  </p>
<p>German economics minister Guenter Rexrodt said the current mark exchange rate is favourable to German exporters.</p>
<p>A trader at a UK clearing bank said "The thing people are still watching for is any sudden change in the data coming out of Germany, and the M3 and Ifo numbers next week will be seen as important".</p>
<p>The January German M3 money supply data are expected over the coming week while the Ifo research institute's business sentiment index is due out on Thursday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, a slightly firmer mark was met with mark sales today from the Spanish and Portuguese central banks, dealers said.  </p>
<p>The peseta weakened slightly in early trade after news of a rise in January unemployment in Spain to 14.07 percent from 13.82 percent in December. Bank of Spain intervention stabilised the unit later and returned it to Thursday's closing levels.</p>
<p>Sterling was a little softer today too after UK Chancellor of the the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke said the pound's rise was hurting exporters and that it was still one of his main reasons for not raising interest rates further.</p>
<p>The Swiss franc weakened also and the dollar set a three year-high at 1.4645 francs in late European trade.</p>
