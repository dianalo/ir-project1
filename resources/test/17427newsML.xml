<p>The first four women to take The Citadel's oath in the school's 153-year history were sworn in on Monday after being blasted out of bed by at dawn and getting closely cropped haircuts.</p>
<p>Wearing gray duty uniforms and black caps, the Class of 2000 marched onto the school's parade grounds as every other class at the school had done to take the oath.</p>
<p>But this time, the class list included women's names, breaking the long male-only tradition the school fought until a Supreme Court decision ended the legal battle in June.</p>
<p>The four women joined 572 men at the ceremony, held in a light rain before parents, school officials and residents.</p>
<p>"It's the law now. If any place can make it work, this place can," said Floyd Hiott of Charleston, South Carolina, whose son is a cadet.</p>
<p>"This whole thing is a real great place and everyone, if they apply themselves, should do well here," said A.T. McArdle of Sanford, Florida, whose grandson was sworn in.</p>
<p>Although The Citadel was forced by court order to admit Shannon Faulkner last year, she became ill and missed the swearing-in ceremony. She stayed in the infirmary for several days and quit the school in less than a week, overcome by stress and isolation.</p>
<p>News of her resignation last year prompted the Corps of Cadets to dance in the rain. On Monday, however, they seemed resigned to the change.</p>
<p>"I think the cadet corp already had an appreciation for these four women before they arrived mainly because of the stated reasons that they want to be in the cadet corp," said Brig. Gen. Clifton Poole, acting president. "They also come here in a non-adversarial environment."</p>
<p>Three of the women are in separate squadrons of "E" Company while one, Nancy Mace, who plays the clarinet, is in "Band" Company.</p>
<p>The class of new recruits started the day at 5:20 a.m. EDT with reveille. By noon they were addressed by the commandant and regimental commander and had visited the cadet store, tailor and barber shop.</p>
<p>"You can make it here no matter how tough it gets. Rely on each other," Regimental Commander Butler Bryant told the class. "You've got to stay fired up, motivated. It's all a state of mind."</p>
<p>Known as the fourth class, or knobs for the way their heads look after shearing, the new cadets learned military posture, facing movements and the proper way to address upperclassmen.</p>
<p>The Citadel Board of Visitors voted June 28 to drop the all-male admissions policy, two days after the Supreme Court ordered Virginia Military Institute (VMI), the only other all-male state-supported military college in the nation, to either admit women or give up public financing.</p>
<p>VMI, which began its "rat line" last week, has a year either to raise $300 million to take the school private or make women a part of the 1997 class.</p>
<p>The women -- Mace, from Goose Creek, South Carolina; Petra Lovetinska, a Czech national from the Washington, D.C. area; Jeanie Mentavlos, from Charlotte, North Carolina; and Kim Messer, of Clover, South Carolina -- were treated equally throughout, including the first-day haircut.</p>
<p>Bit it was a different cut than that given to the men, whose hair is shaved. It was similar to a man's crew cut, left about an inch long.</p>
<p>"The basic standards of the haircut is off the face, off the shoulders, off the collar," Poole said.</p>
<p>The rigour of the miltary college and the berating of Hell Week -- whereby upperclassmen seek to strip away individuality and replace it with comraderie -- was due to intensify.</p>
<p>Some of it started earlier when recruits were awakened by heavy metal band AC/DC's "Hell's Bells," stood at attention on the red and white checkered barracks quadrangle for about a half hour and had to reach some three feet to sign in without touching the table.</p>
