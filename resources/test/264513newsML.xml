<p>The European Commission, in a move that could lead to a damaging transatlantic fight, warned Boeing and McDonnell Douglas Corp. Wednesday that their planned $13.3 billion merger could hurt competition in Europe.</p>
<p>"It seems to us that it may raise questions regarding a dominant position," European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert told a news conference.</p>
<p>He warned that the Commission would have to examine the deal with a "fine-tooth comb" to assess whether it would strengthen the hold of the merged companies over any product or market in the European Union.</p>
<p>He declined to elaborate, saying he first wanted to see the details of the deal which he called "complex and problematic."</p>
<p>The Commission can block large non-EU mergers or acquisitions if the companies involved do significant business in the 15-nation bloc.</p>
<p>Almost a year ago, the Commission forced Kimberly Clark and Scott Paper, both of the United States, to divest important businesses in Britain and Ireland in return for its approval of their merger.</p>
<p>Van Miert said he expected the aerospace companies to submit the deal for EU clearance in January. Boeing representatives met Commission officials on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The two U.S. aerospace companies announced Sunday a $13.3 billion stock-for-stock merger to create the world's leading aerospace and defence company.</p>
<p>The Commission's speedy reaction was seen reflecting a political desire to protect the European consortium Airbus Industrie as much as to defend fair competition in Europe.</p>
<p>"I find it hard to believe that the EU is a neutral party. It has an interest in promoting the European industry, in promoting Airbus," a Brussels-based antitrust lawyer said.</p>
<p>The Commission source estimated the combined market share of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas in the EU would rise to more than 60 percent.</p>
<p>Van Miert left no doubt that the Boeing-led deal could ultimately be blocked by Europe if it was found to hurt competition and if the companies refused to provide remedies.</p>
<p>His unsolicited comments were seen by Commission officials and antitrust lawyers as setting the stage for a political dispute between the two trading partners, who already accuse each other of providing unfair subsidies.</p>
<p>Washington has accused Europe of directly subsidising Airbus, while the U.S. stands accused of more disguised support for its aerospace industry.</p>
<p>"The Americans support their industry by passing huge military orders whose prices are generously calculated," a Commission senior official said.</p>
<p>"Competition is bloody in the sector," he added, noting that it was often difficult to make a clear distinction between the military and the civil aviation businesses of an aircraft maker.</p>
<p>Van Miert stressed that the fact that Boeing and McDonnell Douglas were not European did not mean they escaped the EU's jurisdiction, adding that both met European and worldwide revenue thresholds set in the bloc's merger rules.</p>
<p>The United States may, however, invoke EU treaty provisions that allow national governments in the Union not to submit any military aspects involved in a corporate alliance for Commission clearance.</p>
<p>The first alliance blocked by the Commission, in 1991, involved Boeing's De Havilland subsidiary, which France's Aerospatiale and Italy's Alenia sought to acquire in a joint bid.</p>
