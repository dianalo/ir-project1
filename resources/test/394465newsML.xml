<title>SPAIN: Peseta debt/interbank market closing report.</title>
<headline>Peseta debt/interbank market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-02-21</dateline>

<p>Spanish government bonds ended slightly lower on Friday in line with other European markets amid dull trade.</p>
<p>With little domestic news on the agenda, dealers said they lacked trading ideas. Outside Spain, the European Commission confirmed that Italy's proposed eurotax would be allowed for the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>But the market did not react in any significant way.</p>
<p>"We limited ourselves to tracking Bunds," a dealer in Madrid said. As a result the 10-year spread over Bunds remained stuck at 120 basis points.  </p>
<p>But a relatively strong peseta, recovering from a bout of high volatility earlier this week, was boosting prices at the short end of the yield curve.</p>
<p>The curve steepened further today, with the three- to 10-year spread widening to 123 basis points from 120 bps and the five- to 10-year differential to 96 basis points from 93 bps. -- Madrid Newsroom, + 341 585 8340</p>
