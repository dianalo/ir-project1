<p>Goldman Sachs analyst Nomi Ghez on Thursday cut her rating on food and consumer products company Sara Lee Corp to a market performer from market outperformer.</p>
<p>-- "...(W)e believe a second year of single digit operating income, combined with continuing hosiery difficulties are likely to put a lid on the stock's appreciation in the current market environment," Ghez said in a report.  "We believe the downside risk in the stock is limited due to its year-to-date relative underperformance, and continuing active share buybacks."  </p>
<p>-- Earlier, Sara Lee reported earnings for the fourth quarter of $0.57 a share, up from $0.52 a year ago.</p>
<p>-- Sara Lee said all of its four business units reported gains in operating profit.  In Personal Products, however, worldwide legwear units fell seven percent during the quarter, reflecting a nine percent decline in sheer hosiery unit volume and a one percent increase in socks.</p>
<p>-- Ghez said the earnings were in line with her estimates, but added operating income for Sara Lee was up only by a single-digit percentage in the fourth quarter and fiscal 1997, largely due to the effects of foreign currencies.</p>
<p>-- The analyst said she maintained her fiscal 1998 earnings estimate at $2.25 a share but said she now expected these results to be achieved with lower than previously expected tax rate and operating income up only by a mid-single-digit rate.</p>
<p>-- Sarea Lee shares were off 1-2/16 at 43-9/16.</p>
