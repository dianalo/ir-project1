<p>General Abdul Rashid Dostum, a potential rival to Afghanistan's Taleban militia, and ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani met and embraced on a highway near here on Tuesday and proceeded in a convoy to a military base for talks.</p>
<p>The meeting followed a report from a senior Afghan diplomat that Dostum, who commands troops in northern Afghanistan, would join forces with Rabbani in resisting the advance of the fundamentalist Taleban.  </p>
<p>Hundreds of Dostum soldiers were standing in uniform at attention with their weapons along the road into the city. Rabbani also met a group of several hundred city dignitaries and army officials standing on one side of the highway.</p>
<p>After the highway formalities Dostum and Rabbani climbed into a limousine for the ride to the Kala Jangy base west of the city.</p>
<p>Before he met Rabbani, Dostum told reporters he would prefer not to answer any questions until Rabbani spoke.</p>
<p>"Let us wait until the president is here and let him speak and then i will answer your questions," Dostum said, adding: "Masood will come today or if he cannot make it today then tomorrow," a reference to Rabbani's military commander Ahmad Shah Masood who has dug in and is facing Taleban forces near the Panjsher Valley.</p>
