<headline>Treasury funds recover as bond mkt rallies--Lipper.</headline>

<p>General U.S. Treasury funds have begun to recover this fall, as the recent bond market rally helped erase nine months of declines, Lipper Analytical Services Inc reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>Average general U.S. Treasury funds were up more than 2.0 percent for the year as a whole, higher than pure Treasury funds, which were up about 1.5 percent, Lipper said.</p>
<p>When interest rates were rising earlier in the year, leading U.S. government funds invested in mortgage securities, which Lipper said, held up better. The mortgage paper, it said, typically carried high coupons with short average maturities.</p>
<p>But, Lipper reported, Gail Seneca, who manages the Citizens Income fund, invested in non-mortgage sectors including junk and investment grade corporate bonds.</p>
<p>"Good security selection in these two sectors have contributed to strong results for her fund," Lipper said.</p>
<p>Lagging funds invested much of their assets in longer-maturing Treasury bonds, the firm reported.</p>
<p>Market outlooks are mixed, according to Lipper. While some see interest rates falling in the next few years as inflation remains tame, others believe the bond market will be tested by both positive technical factors, which have fueled the recent rally, and negative macroeconomic fundamentals, which could pressure Treasuries.</p>
