<title>ITALY: BCI shares rise, Credito firm.</title>
<headline>BCI shares rise, Credito firm.</headline>

<p>Shares in one of Italy's top banks Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) rose on Wednesday following the rise in fellow bank Credito Italiano and also because restrictions on stake building could soon be removed, dealers said.</p>
<p>BCI was privatised in March 1994 with a limit of three percent set for individual shareholders. After three years, by March 1997, the bank is able to abolish this three percent rule with a decision at an extraordinary meeting.</p>
<p>Dealers said that BCI's share advance followed the progress of Credito, and also on the view that after the share limit is abolished a buyer may start to build up a stake.</p>
<p>At 1130 GMT, BCI shares were up 4.84 percent at 3,510 lire after a day's high of 3,540 lire, with trading volumes of around 14.5 million shares.</p>
<p>Credito was the first bank to be privatised by Italian state holding body IRI in December 1993, and was closely followed by BCI. Since Credito has been privatised now for three years, it can abolish its own three percent limit with an extraordinary meeting.</p>
<p>Credito shares had been rising this week after it issued results late last week showing 1996 net profits up about 30 percent at above 250 billion lire. Its shares were up 2.43 percent at 2,400 lire in a firmer Milan stock market.</p>
