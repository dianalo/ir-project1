<p>Cool relations between Slovakia and Hungary showed signs of warming on Monday with the announcement of a meeting between the two prime ministers next month.</p>
<p>The official Slovak TASR news agency said Slovak Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar would meet his Hungarian counterpart Gyula Horn in Gyor, Hungary, on August 15.</p>
<p>The announcement followed a meeting between Slovak Foreign Minister Zdenka Kramplova and Hungary's Laszlo Kovacs in Komarno, Slovakia.</p>
<p>Ties between the two countries have been strained by the problem of Slovakia's treatment of its 500,000-strong Hungarian minority and by a controversial dam project on the river Danube.</p>
<p>A further potential division arose when Hungary received a green light to start accession talks with NATO and a signal from the European Commission that it would be invited to negotiate European Union membership as well.</p>
<p>Slovakia, once a frontrunner to join both groups, was not on the list of potential new members of either.</p>
<p>A statement after the Kramplova-Kovacs meeting said the premiers would focus on European integration and the implementation of an awaited ruling by the International Court in the Hague on the Gabcikovo dam project.</p>
<p>The U.S. and other Western allies have criticised Slovakia over four years of opaque political infighting, its treatment of the Hungarian minority and major shortcomings in media and other reforms.</p>
<p>The last formal meeting between Meciar and Horn was in early 1995 in Paris when they signed a friendship treaty under the auspices of the European Union.</p>
<p>Since then, several planned meetings between the two have failed to materialise.</p>
<p>Kramplova played down differences between the neighbours.</p>
<p>"We who are responsible for Slovak-Hungarian relations are of the opinion that they are better and broader than presented in public," Kramplova told TASR after meeting Kovacs.</p>
