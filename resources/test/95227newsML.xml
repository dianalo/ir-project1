<p>Wheat futures in Australia tracked U.S. prices lower in continued light volume trading.</p>
<p>Trading was restricted to the nearby months, with most active January down A$4.00 to $157.50 a tonne.</p>
<p>Grains traders said the U.S. market was undermined by strong rumours that Egypt had rejected a cargoe of U.S. wheat.</p>
<p>"This spilled over to our market," one said.</p>
<p>With Janaury and March wheat settling below A$160.00 a tonne, traders said technical support, which has helped prop up prices recently, may be faltering, the trader said.</p>
