<p>World sugar production should reach 122.80 million tonnes raw value in 1996/97, down on the 123.34 million turned out in 1995/96, Czarnikow Sugar said in a report on Thursday.</p>
<p>Czarnikow's last estimate in February pegged production at 123.48 million tonnes, slightly exceeding its then forecast of 1995/96 output.</p>
<p>"At this stage of the crop cycle adjustments should be relatively small as there are only the northern hemisphere crops still to complete and many of those are either well advanced or have already finished," it said.</p>
<p>The estimate for world sugar consumption in 1997 was also revised downwards by 556,000 tonnes from February to 120.44 million tonnes. Czarnikow noted that this was still higher than the 1996 figure of 118.28 million.</p>
<p>The report said it was maintaining a disappearance factor of 750,000 tonnes, which would result in a stock addition of 1.61 million tonnes after the much larger gain of 4.41 million which developed in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Although the consumption estimate had been scaled back, Czarnikow said, the overall upward trend was continuing with particular strength being seen Asia and the Far East.</p>
<p>In production, the largest changes in the estimate were in the cane sector where a total output of 85.20 million tonnes was expected for 1996/97 after 86.98 million in 1995/96.</p>
<p>India showed the largest change and production was forecast at 14.24 million tonnes, compared with the February estimate of 15.0 million and the bumper 17.88 million turned out in 1995/96.</p>
<p>In Brazil, the dominant western hemisphere producer, the 1996/97 output estimate was raised by 175,000 tonnes to 14.78 million after 13.59 million in 1995/96.</p>
<p>This would represent a run of seven successive increased crops since the 1989/90 season, Czarnikow said.</p>
<p>Sugar production estimates were also revised for Cuba and Thailand.</p>
<p>Cuban production was forecast at 4.25 million tonnes after the previous estimate of 4.65 million and estimated 4.53 million turned out in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Czarnikow's estimate for Thai sugar production was revised down by 340,000 tonnes to 6.08 million tonnes, after a late start to the campaign and disappointing extraction rates. Last season's output was 6.32 million.</p>
<p>The European Union was expected to produce 17.93 million tonnes of sugar in 1996/97, up from last year's 17.03 million.</p>
