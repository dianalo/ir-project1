<p>Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Yasuo Matsushita told a parliamentary committee meeting on Wednesday that the BOJ would continue to pay attention to movements in asset prices and money supply in managing its monetary policy.  </p>
<p>Matsushita told the Lower House of parliament's finance committee that the BOJ's monetary policy was aimed at achieving sustainable economic growth without inflation.</p>
<p>"It is necessary for us to take speedy measures (to achieve sustainable growth without inflation), while paying attention to movements in asset prices and money supply," he said.</p>
<p>The BOJ's monetary policy must not be used solely to correct foreign exchange rates or external imbalances, he added.</p>
