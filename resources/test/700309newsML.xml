<p>Swedbank and I&amp;L said on Tuesday that their Swedish purchasing managers' index rose to 62.3 in June from 61.2 in May, showing the industrial economic trend improved further.  </p>
<p>"This confirms the positive development we have seen in the industrial cycle in the previous year," I&amp;L and Swedbank said in a statement.</p>
<p>They noted that for the second month running the index was over 60.</p>
<p>"This indicates that the improvement in the industrial cycle is occuring at a good pace," they said.</p>
<p>Domestic order intake rose.</p>
<p>"For the second month running this component of the index has improved considerably, although it is still too early to draw any conclusion about whether this is a long-lasting change. It is of course a positive sign."</p>
