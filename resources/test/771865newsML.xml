<p>The planned August 7 dual listing of South  Africa's Protea Furnishers on the Botswana Stock Exchange (BSE) may  be postponed, BSE vice-chairman Andrew Ashton said on Friday.</p>
<p>The company, listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE), has  not complied with the listing requirements, Ashton said.</p>
<p>"We extended our Wesdnesday deadline to tonight (Friday), but we still  do not have the information we require to approve the listing ourselves  and seek the approval of the Bank of Botswana," he said.</p>
<p>"We will speak to them again on Monday, but the listing could be postponed."</p>
<p>Profurn plans to list 510,216,681 shares. It would be the sixth company  to dual list on the BSE. With the shares closing at 245 South African  cents (Botswana thebe 195) on Friday on the JSE, the listing would  add around 1,000 million pula or 1.75 percent to the BSE's overall  market capitalisation.</p>
<p>Its share of the dual-listed board would be around 1.8 percent.</p>
