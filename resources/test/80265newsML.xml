<p>Philippines' Asian Terminal Inc said on Thursday it was rehabilitating and expanding its pier in Manila and installing additional ship-to-shore cranes.</p>
<p>The company said it had bought a second-hand Hitachi quay crane from the Port of Singapore Authority to augment its container handling capability at the Port of Manila.</p>
<p>It added that it was expecting three more cranes which will be delivered over the next nine months.</p>
<p>The company also said that it was extending its Pier 5 by another 256 metres, of which 60 percent of the extended pier would be finished before the end of the year.</p>
<p>"ATI is currently undertaking massive port reconstruction works to boost its container handling capability as well as meet the projected increase in container volume in the Port of Manila," the company said in a statement.</p>
