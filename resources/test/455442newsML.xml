<p>UEFA said on Thursday it would look into the clash that left eight Manchester United fans injured after a run-in with anti-riot police following Wednesday's European Cup quarter-final against Porto.</p>
<p>The incident will top the agenda at the UEFA's regularly scheduled Control and Disciplinary committee meeting next Tuesday in Nyon.</p>
<p>UEFA spokesman Frits Alstrom said the committee could impose immediate sanctions after reviewing reports from the police, referee and official delegate, Des Casey.</p>
<p>"There could be sanctions taken right away but we will have to see the report first," said Alstrom. "We will have to see if what happened is a UEFA matter.</p>
<p>"What happened outside the stadium is not always a UEFA responsibility unless it has something to do with security or some other related issue."</p>
<p>The problems began as some United fans tried to leave the stadium shortly before the end of the game, ignoring official instructions to stay put.</p>
<p>Oporto police chief Delfim Passos said his men fired plastic pellets and small rubber balls -- both part of anti-riot equipment -- to contain United fans seeking to break out of the stadium.</p>
<p>The injured, including one fan with head wounds, were taken to hospital but all were discharged in the early hours of Thursday, British consular officials said.</p>
<p>The match ended 0-0 but Manchester United went through 4-0 on aggregate after trouncing Porto at Old Trafford.</p>
