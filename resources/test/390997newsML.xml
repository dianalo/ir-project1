<p>Workers at national Venezuelan telephone company CANTV have threatened to go on an indefinite strike, Cruz Hernandez, president of the umbrella labor group for telecommunications workers Fetratel, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The workers will set a strike date next Thursday if CANTV does not improve before then on recent wage offers.</p>
<p>The company proposed a 40 percent increase in pay bonuses Wednesday, Hernandez said, "which was immediately refused".</p>
<p>That proposal was the third to be rejected by workers. It followed a February 5 offer that CANTV said upped take-home pay 37 percent in 1996 and 77 percent next year.</p>
<p>Workers have said they want a 125 percent increase to compensate for triple-digit inflation last year.</p>
