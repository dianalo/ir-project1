<p>German Bunds and futures were under pressure in late dealings on Monday as jitters about the future of European monetary union weighed on the market.</p>
<p>At 1340 GMT, DTB September Bund futures were down 12 basis points at 100.72, while the 10-year cash benchmark Bund due July 2007 was at 101.52 with a yield of 5.79 percent.</p>
<p>The market fell after France threw the European Union into turmoil by telling its partners it wanted time to study an already agreed deal designed to keep budget deficits from ballooning after the single currency is introduced.  </p>
<p>Officials insisted there was no question of reopening the hard-fought agreement and that it was a matter of allowing the new government time to look at it.</p>
<p>But some market traders said they were disappointed that the pact would not be approved later this month at an European Union summit in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>"It seems like every day we are hearing more and more bad news about EMU and nothing supportive," said one trader.</p>
<p>MMS International said the market's reaction was predictable in that German debt underperformed the U.S. market but outperformed other European debt markets.  </p>
<p>On a technical basis, traders said September futures should find support at 100.68 and further support at 100.53 and 100.49 in a congestive area.</p>
<p>Resistance was pegged at 101.00 and 101.33.</p>
