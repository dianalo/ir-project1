<p>Austrian Defence Minister Werner Fasslabend widened a rift in the ruling coalition on Tuesday by calling for neutral Austria to join NATO by 1999.</p>
<p>"The window of opportunity is open, but it will not always be as open," Fasslabend said in a speech to members of his conservative People's Party.</p>
<p>He said half a year should be enough time for Austria to debate the issue, citing the lengthy ratification process by NATO members' parliaments as a reason to resolve the issue as soon as possible. If it decided then, it could join in 1999, he said.</p>
<p>The issue has already driven a wedge into the government because the dominant party in the coalition, Chancellor Viktor Klima's Social Democrats, are fiercely opposed to joining NATO its current form.</p>
<p>The issue surfaced in Austria after it joined the European Union in 1995, and has intensified as the alliance moves closer to inviting applications from some of Austria's formerly communist eastern neighbours at a summit in Madrid in July.</p>
<p>Last weekend conservative Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel said the enlargement of the EU and of NATO were inextricably linked.</p>
<p>But the Social Democrats insist the time is not right for NATO membership, and want to see how the alliance develops as links are forged to former enemies in the east. In any case they want a referendum before Austria considers relinquishing its neutrality.</p>
<p>Fasslabend told the national news agency APA that the government could not shrink from every difficult question and leave it to the public to decide.</p>
<p>"The population expects a line from the government," he said.</p>
<p>He said NATO membership would bring greater security and a reduction of defence costs, and that a decision would have to be taken on NATO before the question of abolishing national service could be discussed.</p>
<p>"The protection of the most efficient security organisation is greater than if we were to go it alone," he said.</p>
<p>During the Cold War the Soviet Union, which occupied Austria after World War Two with fellow victors Britain, France and the United States, insisted that Austria must remain neutral.</p>
<p>It pulled its troops out of the country in 1955 only on condition that neutrality was enshrined in the constitution.</p>
