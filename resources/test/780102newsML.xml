<p>Italy on Tuesday permitted private power producers to sell surplus electricity to third parties if state utility Enel refuses to buy it, a government statement said.</p>
<p>The decision brings some relief to private generators hit by Enel's decision last month to no longer buy excess electricity supplies from the private sector.</p>
<p>Industry sources put the cost to Enel of buying the excess production of others at around 500 billion lire ($274 million) per year.</p>
<p>Enel's decision, which followed talks between the utility and Italy's energy sector watchdog authority, would have a beneficial effect on it balance sheet, the sources added.</p>
<p>The move would not have hit private plants which are contracted to produce electricity for Enel.</p>
<p>But those such as Montedison's Edison and Sondel, part of the Falck group, would be affected as they sell their excess electricity supplies to the state-owned utility.</p>
<p>These two private groups account for around 70 percent of sales of "excess electricity" and have accused Enel of breaching a 1991 accord under which they claim the state utility must buy their surplus power.</p>
<p>But Enel has said it has no such obligation and that it must increasingly adapt to open market conditions ahead of the liberalisation of the Italian electricity market in 1999 and the company's own privatisation.</p>
<p>Enel supplies some 80 percent of domestic demand and buys the rest from independent producers at what industry sources say are inflated prices.</p>
