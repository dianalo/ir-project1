<p>Corporate Express Inc., an office supply company, Wednesday warned of disappointing fourth-quarter results, triggering a furious sell-off that wiped out almost half the value of its stock.</p>
<p>The stock fell $8.375 to $9.94 on Nasdaq, where it was the day's biggest loser and by far the most active issue, with more than 36 million shares changing hands by early afternoon. The average daily trading volume of the stock is only about 822,000 shares.</p>
<p>The sell-off dragged the stock down to the lowest level in two years. The all-time, intra-day high of $31.125 was reached in June.</p>
<p>Corporate Express said its fourth-quarter earnings will be below analysts' estimates and that 1996 earnings per share before expenses will be 5 cents to 7 cents below First Call estimates.</p>
<p>Wall Street had been expecting earnings of 16 cents per share for the fourth quarter and 50 cents for the full year, according to First Call consensus estimates.</p>
<p>Broomfield, Colo.-based Corporate Express had a net loss of $23.5 million, or 34 cents a share, on sales of $468.5 million in the 1996 fourth quarter, when it took $48.3 million in merger and non-recurring charges.</p>
<p>The company said it expected revenues of about $3.2 billion for the fiscal year ended March 1.</p>
<p>Corporate Express said earnings were hurt by the weak performance of its same-day delivery business, including the integration of United TransNet Inc. and consolidation of delivery services.</p>
<p>Last September, Corporate Express said it would acquire United TransNet in a stock deal then worth about $183 million.</p>
<p>It said a previously announced increase in operating expenses may also have "a short term negative effect."</p>
<p>The company said, however, that its core business continued to perform above expectations and that its year-to-year earnings per share should grow.</p>
<p>"We are pleased with our overall trends," the company said in a release. "We expect earnings per share year-to-year to grow approximately 40 percent from the earnings that we expect to report for the fiscal year just ended."</p>
<p>Corporate Express operates in more than 750 locations, including 100 distribution centres, with a fleet of about 10,000 delivery vehicles and about 23,000 employees in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France and Britain.</p>
