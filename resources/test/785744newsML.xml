<p>More European and U.S. oil companies were lining up tanker charters on Thursday in anticipation of an imminent resumption of Iraqi crude exports, tanker brokers said.</p>
<p>Brokers listed U.S. Coastal, Spain's Cepsa and France's Elf reserving 130,000 tonners, subject to confirmation, to load Iraqi Kirkuk from the Turkish Mediterranean pipeline outlet at Ceyhan for mid to late August.</p>
<p>Iraq on Friday is expected to receive approval for pricing formulas allowing it to resume exports under the second phase of the UN's oil-for-food scheme.</p>
<p>There were no new indications of tankers fixed for Iraq's Gulf port of Mina al-Bakr.</p>
<p>Brokers said last week U.S. trader Bayoil had already reserved the ULCC Concordia while Coastal was reported to have the Stena Companion.</p>
<p>Turkish refiner Tupras and Russian companies are also expected to be among early lifters of Iraqi crude.</p>
