<p>The Malaysian central bank on Friday denied rumours it has taken monetary control measures to stop an attack on its currency.</p>
<p>Bank Negara also assured the market its monetary stance has not changed and the recent rise in interest rates was a temporary phenomenon.</p>
<p>In a rare statement in response to market activity, it said: "Bank Negara Malaysia has denied...that it has issued instructions to banks to stop undertaking swap transactions."</p>
<p>Money market and currency dealers said the market earlier on Friday was awash with rumours that Bank Negara had told domestic banks to stop quoting ringgit-swaps rates to offshore banks.</p>
<p>The move would have reduced liquidity, forcing banks holding short ringgit positions to cover at a loss.</p>
<p>"The market was nervous over these rumours. Even after the statement, things will depend on the Thai market," said a money market dealer at a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>The rumours came after the Bank of Thailand imposed a swap-quote ban on Thursday to ward off speculators in the baht.</p>
<p>Kuala Lumpur stocks and the ringgit, like other markets in Southeast Asia, have been roiling this week over worries that Thailand's economic woes would spill over into the region.</p>
<p>Dealers said the ringgit has been acutely short in the money market this week after Negara intervened to buy the currency and prevent it from weakening too much against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Dealers estimate the Malaysian central bank bought more than 2.5 billion ringgit ($1 billion).</p>
<p>Bank Negara in its four-sentence statement assured the market the ringgit shortage and the accompanying rise in interbank rates were temporary.</p>
<p>"The shortage in ringgit in the market arising from the speculative activities has resulted in a rise in the short-term money market rates.</p>
<p>"This is a temporary phenomena. The currrent monetary policy stance remains unchanged," it said.</p>
<p>Bank Negara has been sensitive to rumours about monetary controls since late 1993 and early 1994, when the Bank imposed a series of monetary controls to prevent speculative attacks on the ringgit. This followed the central bank's reporting of foreign exchange losses amounting to 15 billion ringit (then $5.61 billion) in 1992 and 1993.</p>
<p>The controls caught foreign investors and speculators alike off-guard, prompting widespread criticism of the Bank.</p>
<p>Economists said this week's speculative attack on the ringgit was partly caused by worries the Malaysian property market may follow that of Thailand in pulling down the economy. Bank Negara in late March announced curbs on lending to buy properties to curb asset speculation.</p>
<p>"For the ringgit, it is a bit unwarranted. There's no weakness in the economy or the exchange rate for that matter, though there may be questions on the property sector," said Song Seng Wun, regional economist at ABN Amro Hoare Govett.</p>
<p>Ng Bok Eng, regional economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said: "Most fund managers are cautious about Malaysia, thinking there's some excesses now in the system -- the property market, loans to consumers."</p>
<p>He said there was a concern that if property and consumer loans do not slow down in the next few months, Bank Negara may be forced to tighten interest rates.</p>
