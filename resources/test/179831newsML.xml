<p>Pressure mounted on Monday for a probe of Russian war veterans' charities after a bomb blast, blamed on faction feuding, killed 13 mourners in a Moscow cemetery.</p>
<p>The victims included the widow, mother and uncle of Mikhail Likhodei, a veterans' leader whose murder in a bomb blast on November 10, 1994, was being commemorated by about 130 people gathered around his grave.</p>
<p>Investigators said the killing on Sunday was linked to a longstanding bloody feud between two rival branches of a charity set up to help disabled victims of the Afghan war.</p>
<p>The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, asked Russian prosecutors to open a full investigation into the five-year-old Afghan War Invalids' Foundation, while some politicians said it was time for a wider crackdown on tax breaks enjoyed by non-profit organisations.</p>
<p>"It is well known that these organisations spend between two and five percent of their revenue on their ostensible field of activities. The rest all goes to bandits," liberal politician Konstantin Borovoi told Ekho Moskvy radio.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin, who is recovering from a quintuple heart bypass operation, issued a statement condemning the "terrorist" attack and vowing a thorough investigation. Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov will take special charge of the hunt.</p>
<p>Survivors of the blast called for a national day of mourning and angrily denied any links with criminal groupings, saying the bombing was intended to discredit their movement.</p>
<p>"This terrorist act is aimed first and foremost at splitting the Afghan (veterans') movement and discrediting it," foundation official Vasily Sadovnik told an emotional news conference.</p>
<p>"We urge the Interior Ministry and the FSB (Russia's counter-intelligence service)...to take all necessary measures to uncover the perpetrators of this act," he said, choking back tears.</p>
<p>His colleague, Mitrofan Anosov, said he had been at the cemetery at the time of the blast and added that their foundation was a legitimate body. "We fought for our country, we were once acclaimed as heroes," he said. "Do we look like bandits?"</p>
<p>Detectives found a wire leading to an electronic timing device some 40 metres (yards) away, outside the Kotlyakovsky cemetery.</p>
<p>There was no sign of the killers, who had hidden their high explosive near Likhodei's grave, but on Monday police put together a photo-fit of a "suspicious looking man seen just before the blast", Interfax news agency reported.</p>
<p>The incident was the latest in a series of explosions and gangland murders to rock Moscow. Five years of transition to a market economy have channelled vast resources into private hands and generated a spate of unsolved contract killings of prominent businessmen, bankers and officials.</p>
<p>U.S. businessman Paul Tatum, locked in a dispute with Russian partners over ownership of a Moscow hotel where U.S. President Bill Clinton has stayed, died in a hail of bullets at the entrance to a nearby underground station on November 3.</p>
<p>Likhodei had been feuding with a rival branch of the Invalids' Foundation led by Colonel Valery Radchikov, who himself narrowly escaped an assassination attempt in 1995.</p>
<p>Sevodnya newspaper quoted tax inspectors as saying criminals had used the Foundation, which benefited from tax and excise exemptions on imports and exports, to launder money and send it out of the country.</p>
<p>According to Interior Ministry sources quoted by Interfax, the foundation controlled around $120 million.</p>
<p>At the end of 1995 the foundation and other charities lost their rights to import alcohol and tobacco without paying duty, a scam which is estimated to have cost the Russian treasury billions of dollars in lost taxes.</p>
<p>The biggest beneficiary of the loophole was the National Sports Fund, which at one point handled half Russia's alcohol imports and controlled assets running into billions of dollars.</p>
<p>This summer Boris Fyodorov, head of the Sports Fund, narrowly escaped an assassination attempt by a killer who left him with bullet and stab wounds. He was accused of possessing cocaine but the charges were dropped for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>Investigators believe organised crime groups in Russia are still making money out of the charity business, although the biggest tax loopholes have been closed.</p>
