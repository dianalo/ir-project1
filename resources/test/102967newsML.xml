<p>Transport companies of the future will increasingly combine modes of transport and some mega-combines will emerge, delegates to a European Research Center conference on transport infrastructure, heard on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The increasingly global nature of trade will mean shippers demand from transporters more efficient use of transport infrastructures and that will give rise to combinations of transport modes, said Edward Emmett, president of the U.S. National Industrial Transportation League industry body.</p>
<p>"The shippers will be demanding the best use of the infrastructure without necessarily specifying it," he said.</p>
<p>Emmett said traditional demarcations in the transport industry could begin to melt as shippers -- the manufacturers and producers which use transport -- demanded the fastest, most cost effective ways to move their goods.</p>
<p>"When customers go to a grocery store to buy something off a shelf, they don't care how it got there. Likewise shippers are going to begin to have the same attitude as long as their product is delivered where they want it, at a time they want it delivered, at a price they consider fair," he said in an interview after his conference address.</p>
<p>Constant pressure on prices along with globalisation of commerce would drive the move towards integration of carriers.</p>
<p>"When you were only shipping a few hundred miles and selling all your products within a small radius that was easy. Now trying to move products from here to the States and further you need a more integrated carrier," said Emmett.</p>
<p>That would entail handing over transport operations to someone with expertise in different countries who could handle administrative problems and other negotiations leaving companies to concentrate on their core activities.</p>
<p>An example of increasing switching between modes of transport was to be found in the U.S. where some trucking firms had found that at distances of over 500 miles it was more efficient to put a trailer onto a train.</p>
<p>From that sort of solution it was a short step to fully integrated mega-carriers, combining all transport modes.</p>
<p>"I believe it's happening now," said Emmett, pointing to operations of transport company United Parcels Service.</p>
<p>"UPS has always been integrated (in) trucking and air. UPS is now the largest customer of the Santa Fe railroad in the United States, so it's beginning to tie in," he said.</p>
<p>"We will continue to see the rise in what I call mega-transportation companies. You're going to see XYZ transport company and it will cover all modes," he said, acknowledging it was inevitable some transporters would go out of business.</p>
<p>"Shippers will continue to care less and less about specific modes of transportation. Shippers will want to turn their freight over to somebody that will guarantee its safe arrival in a timely fashion, they will not care whether that goes by truck, by rail, by air or by donkey cart," he told the conference.</p>
