<p>Shanghai copper futures ended mostly limit-up on Monday, the first trading session after the Lunar New Year holiday, on stop loss buying triggered by world price gains over the past two weeks, traders said.</p>
<p>The most active May 1997 contract ended limit-up at 22,100 yuan ($2,665) per tonne, rising 520 yuan. It opened at an intraday low of 21,980 yuan.</p>
<p>March rose 520 to 22,120, April 550 to 22,130, June 550 to 22,100, July 600 to 22,100 and August 340 to 22,200.</p>
<p>Combined volume fell to 12,120 tonnes from 46,110.  </p>
<p>Traders noted the rises in London Metal Exchange copper prices during the past two weeks, when China closed down to celebrate the arrival of the Year of the Ox.</p>
<p>"Monday's stop loss buying pushed the prices to limit-up early in the session but volume was thin with few investors willing to sell at current levels," one trader said.</p>
<p>He said traders expected copper to rise further following Monday's breach of the 21,800-22,000 strong resistance level.</p>
<p>Traders said firm domestic spot copper prices of around 22,000 yuan per tonne in Shanghai, also supported the rises on the futures market.  </p>
<p>Some traders said current world over-supply of copper was not a condition likely to change in the short-term.</p>
<p>"Domestic demand is also not likely to rise sharply in 1997 despite China's booming economy," another trader said.</p>
<p>Aluminium ended up. March rose 100 to 15,600 yuan per tonne, April 210 to 15,900 and May 120 to 16,000. The first traded June contract ended at 16,000 yuan tonne.</p>
<p>Combined volume rose to 2,070 tonnes from 1,120.</p>
