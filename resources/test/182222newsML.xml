<title>LITHUANIA: IMF sees devaluation if Lithuania ends litas peg.</title>
<headline>IMF sees devaluation if Lithuania ends litas peg.</headline>

<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned on Tuesday that unpegging Lithuania's litas from the dollar would cause a devaluation but did not think there could be a quick end to the currency link.</p>
<p>The incoming government led by the right-wing Homeland Union party wants to end the peg of four litas to one dollar and scrap the currency board system under which the peg is operated.</p>
<p>"The abolition of the currency board would cause the litas to devalue and inflation would increase sharply and all Lithuania's achievements would become worthless," IMF resident representative Domenico Fannizza told newspaper Respublkia.</p>
<p>Under the currency board, the central bank has to keep enough reserves in its vaults to back the amount of currency of circulation at the set exchange rate.</p>
<p>It is also deprived of the usual powers of a central bank such as changing interest rates, making foreign exchange market interventions or acting in the inter-bank market.</p>
<p>The currency board is part of the IMF's agreements with Lithuania and must be in place until at least September 1997.</p>
<p>The Homeland Union initially backed a quick end to the currency peg but has since backed off, favouring an 18 month timeperiod.</p>
<p>Fannizza also said it would not be possible quickly to end the currency board.</p>
<p>"We think the currency board should be in place at least for the near future, until the Bank of Lithuania is completely ready to take over the functions of a central bank," he said.</p>
<p>The IMF has lent $295 million to Lithuania and talks are underway on a further $60 million credit.</p>
<p>"It will take a long time (to end the currency board) and I think that even when the (IMF) memorandum expires in September 1997 there will be a lot of things to do," Fannizza added.</p>
<p>"It all depends on decisions made at the time -- whether the financial market is stable, whether there is a system of institutions, whether the Bank of Lithuania has enough hard currency reserves because now it is clear that they do not have enough reserves," he said.</p>
<p>Fannizza said he has had talks with the new government, which is expected to be in power before the end of the year.</p>
<p>"It does not matter for us who creates the government but it is important that a stable fiscal and economic policy is continued," he added.</p>
