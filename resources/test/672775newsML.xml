<p>Cellular phone company Pilipino Telephone Corp rose by 1.50 pesos, or 15 pct, to 11.50 pesos on foreign buying, traders said.</p>
<p>"The stock has been battered and probably some investors are buying it back in view of its very cheap levels. Also, they probably expect some improvement in the anti-cloning measures that the firm has put in place in the first quarter," said Helen Alvarez, research director at All Asia Securities.</p>
<p>Dharmala Securities analyst Manuel Goseco said foreign investors were seen buying the issue.</p>
<p>Piltel was the most active issue early in the session with 97.7 million pesos worth of shares traded.</p>
<p>Cloning refer to fraudulent calls made by people using sophisticated cloning devices. Piltel was hit last year by a severe revenue problem on account of the fraud calls.</p>
