<p>Australian GDP forecasts are likely to fall with the news that equipment investment will contribute nothing to growth in December quarter GDP while construction is likely to detract, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Seasonally adjusted, constant-price spending on plant and equipment was virtually unchanged in the quarter from the previous quarter, implying no impact on GDP.</p>
<p>Buildings-and-structures spending fell by 0.2 pct of GDP but that figure is not used directly in GDP estimates and economists said it will only help show direction in GDP, not magnitude.  </p>
<p>Before the data was issued, economists typically expected business investment to contribute about 0.4 percentage points to quarterly GDP growth.</p>
<p>If economists now revised their forecast investment contribution to zero, then growth expectations for the expenditure-based measure of GDP (GDP-E) would fall by 0.4 percentage points to about zero.</p>
<p>But GDP-E is only one of three GDP measures that are averaged to produce GDP-A, the focus of economic policy.</p>
<p>So revised forecasts of zero business-investment growth would lower GDP-A forecasts by about 0.1 percentage point.  </p>
<p>Capital expenditure in the quarter was also below business expectations revealed in earlier surveys.</p>
<p>The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said some big projects had been deferred, especially in the mining industry and in transport and storage.</p>
<p>The ABS revised up estimates for plant-and-equipment investment for the period before the December quarter, implying stronger GDP growth earlier in calendar 1996.</p>
<p>Macquarie Bank senior economist John Kyriakopoulos said this fitted an emerging picture of the economy having been stronger in 1996 than thought at the time.  </p>
<p>The following table gives economists' average December quarter forecasts expressed as contributions to quarterly GDP growth and updated with today's data.</p>
<p>Items marked with an asterisk are now backed, at least partially, by published data.</p>
<p>The analysis excludes minor items and GDP-P, which is difficult to forecast.</p>

<p>Consumption, private*   0.1 pct pt</p>
<p>		 public     0.2</p>
<p>Capital expenditure		    Wages etc*		   0.3</p>
