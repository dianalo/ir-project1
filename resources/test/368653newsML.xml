<p>COMEX copper futures ended lower Tuesday, as LME copper prices eased along with nearby spreads, despite a smaller-than-expected build in LME copper stocks.</p>
<p>New York Copper Club marketing and social activities this week also dampened market participation, traders said.</p>
<p>COMEX March copper ended down 1.15 cents at 106.00 cents a pound, after seeing a 107.60-105.00 range in the session.</p>
<p>Copper prices are continuing to drift back from the six month highs seen earlier this month, as tightness in the prompt market is resolved, traders said.</p>
<p>"Volatile swings in the LME backwardations cntinue to set the direction for copper prices - more so than the recent large increase in LME copper inventories," Smith Barney analyst David Rinehimer said.</p>
<p>LME stocks have recovered more than 20 percent in the past two weeks, though the build Tuesday of 2,650 tonnes to 218,475 tonnes was less than expected, traders said.</p>
<p>The LME cash-to-three month premium eased further to around $160 a tonne early Tuesday, before ending around $183.00 a tonne, after declining from over $300 a tonne in late January.</p>
<p>The COMEX February/March spread slipped to 1.20 cents a pound from around 1.40 cents Monday.</p>
<p>Seasonal first quarter demand and buying by the Japanese for preferential tariff purchases are seen keeping the prompt market tight, though accelerating world production is still expected to increase supplies later in 1997.</p>
