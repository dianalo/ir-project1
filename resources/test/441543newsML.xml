<p>Samsung Heavy Industry, a shipbuilding affiliate of the Samsung Group, posted a net loss of 294.6 billion won in calendar 1996 from a profit of 41.2 billion a year earlier, a company report distributed ahead of a shareholders' meeting disclosed on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The report said company turnover rose to 3.26 trillion won last year from 2.92 trillion in 1995.</p>
<p>It said falling ship prices, foreign exchange losses and rising interest payments resulted in deteriorating company earnings last year.</p>
<p>Costs attributed to early retirement of employees, encouraged as a method for restructuring the business, also contributed to the loss.</p>
<p>Further details would be announced after the company's shareholder meeting on Friday.</p>
