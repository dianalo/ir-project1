<p>The Polish central bank said it was comfortable with the zloty at 1.9 percent from the parity rate and would closely watch the unit's further moves after the zloty slid down from 2.44/2.27 percent in early trade.  </p>
<p>"The central bank is comfortable with the zloty at around the 1.9 percent above the trading band centre and will closely watch what the zloty's further moves," a senior NBP official, who asked no to be named, said.</p>
<p>At 0740 GMT the zloty already fell to 1.71/1.45 percent from the centre of the trading band from 2.44/2.27 percent above the band centre at opening. It was at 3.1800/60 against the dollar and 1.8698/763 against the mark.</p>
<p>Dealers said the zloty's plunge was caused by foreign investors taking profits on Polish paper to cover losses suffered on the drop of the Czech crown.  </p>
<p>"Some of those foreign players who took heavy losses in the Czech Republic are now selling some of their Polish portfolios to take profits and make up for the losses," said Malgorzata Sawicka, forex dealer at bank Handlowy SA.</p>
