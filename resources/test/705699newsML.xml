<headline>Gold price dips on Australia sale talk - dealers.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-03</dateline>

<p>The gold price fell suddenly on Thursday by about one dollar an ounce and dealers said this followed market talk that the Australian central bank was set to disclose that it had completed a substantial gold sale.</p>
<p>"The market is hearing 167 tonnes and that is why the price has weakened," said one dealer.</p>
<p>He added that the announcement was expected to appear in Australian newspapers on Friday morning.</p>
<p>London gold traded as low as $331.10 per ounce having been bid up to $333 when the rumour first began to circulate and after fixing at $332.30.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, gold was fixed at its lowest since March 24, 1993, at $331,45.</p>
<p>"This (sale) should be bullish because the market is so short but, equally, the market might say "that is Australia, who is next?" said another dealer. - -  London Newsroom 0044 171 542 7729</p>
