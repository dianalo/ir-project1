<headline>Sainsbury shares down as large block placed.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-08</dateline>

<p>Shares in J. Sainsbury Plc dropped on Tuesday, defying strength in other leading food retailers as a sizeable block of stock was placed below the market price, dealers said.</p>
<p>The stock was down 5p at 328 by 1351 GMT in active trade of 8.3 million shares.</p>
<p>"There was a block of three million knocking around earlier which was placed at 326p," said one market maker, adding "whoever bought it could have been left with half a million or so but it was nothing too drastic."</p>
<p>By contrast, Tesco Plc was up three percent and other leading supermarket shares rose as the market welcomed Tesco's results statement showing stabilising margins and steadying price inflation.</p>
