<p>WCE canola ended up on fund buying while feed grain futures rose on an upward surge in CBOT corn futures, traders said.</p>
<p>"Funds bought 1,500 to 2,000 March and some May, crushers bought some May and it enticed some hedges and commission profit taking," a trader said. March canola futures crush margin rose to -22.45 from -23.52 Monday based on CBOT soyoil and meal. March-May spread at $1.30, May-Nov $39, Sep-Nov $5.50, Mar-July $1.60 and May-July $1. Volume was 6,000 lots.</p>
<p>Japan bought 1,000 tonnes canola overnight, sources said.</p>
<p>March canola rose $6 to $413.10, May up $6 to $411.90. May flax rose $3.10 to $349 on commercial demand. Volume was 200.</p>
<p>February western barley rose $1.70 to $137.50 on CBOT corn and Friday's USDA Cattle on Feed Report, traders said, adding Cargill was a key buyer in barley. March rose $1.30 to $136. Feb-May spread $1. Volume was 850.</p>
<p>March feed wheat rose $1.40 to $166.10 on commercials, May climbed $1.50 to $164 on commission houses buying from Alberta Wheat Pool, traders said. Volume was 510 lots.</p>
<p>Oats did not trade. RBC-DS bid for feed peas, floor sources said.</p>
