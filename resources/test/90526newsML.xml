<p>Optical fibres, the invention at the heart of late 20th century telecommunications, occur naturally in the chilly waters of the Antarctic, a group of scientists claimed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The creature they identified as having stolen a march of several millenia on the world's telecom giants is the humble Antarctic hexactinellid, or sponge.</p>
<p>The scientists, from three Italian zoological and biological institutes, wrote in the journal Nature that they had examined spicules which protrude some 10 cm (four inches) from the creature's body.</p>
<p>The spicules were bent at a 90 degree angle. They shone a laser beam down them and discovered that the spicules showed similar light-carrying properties to optical fibres.</p>
<p>"The intensity of the light immediately after the bend ...reached 65 percent after 10 millimetres...decreasing to about 10 percent after 40 millimetres," they reported.</p>
<p>The scientists suggested that the light-transferring properties of the spicules helped the survival of microscopic unicellular algae known as diatoms, which live deep inside the sponges.</p>
