<p>Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert met ministers responsible for animal protection from Germany's regional states on Thursday to discuss ways of improving conditions for transporting live animals.</p>
<p>"Animals must be transported in such a way that they don't feel any pain and don't suffer," Borchert told reporters before the meeting began.</p>
<p>After seeing reports of cruel methods of transporting veal calves, Borchert demanded tight rules and tough punishments be introduced to help improve animal protection.</p>
<p>"Our goal is now that we in Germany and in other countries in Europe, together with animal protection organisations, must make efforts to improve conditions for animals," he said.</p>
<p>Around 100 people were expected to demonstrate in Munich later on Thursday against live animal exports, police said.</p>
<p>As a reaction to a German television report about animal transport from Germany to Lebanon via the Italian port of Trieste, one regional agriculture ministry has refused to issue certificates for animals to travel via the port.</p>
<p>Up to 6,000 cows and sheep from the state of Lower Saxony will be affected by the decision.</p>
