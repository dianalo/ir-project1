<p>Australian police on Monday decided to drain a large lake and a swamp in the country's rural southeast in their hunt for a toddler who disappeared a week ago.</p>
<p>The order to lower the water level in eight-km-long (five-mile) Lake Narracan by one metre (three feet) and to pump the nearby swamp dry came as hopes faded of finding 14-month-old Jaidyn Leskie alive.</p>
<p>The boy went missing in the early hours of June 15 from the home of his mother's boyfriend in Moe, a small town southeast of Melbourne, in a suspected abduction believed at first to be linked to a religious cult.</p>
<p>The mother's boyfriend left Jaidyn alone while he went to collect the boy's mother, Bilynda Murphy, from a night out drinking with friends in a nearby town.</p>
<p>When they returned, Jaidyn was missing and a severed pig's head had been thrown on to the front lawn of the house, fuelling speculation that a religious sect lay behind his disappearance.</p>
<p>Police later said the pig's head was unrelated to the boy's disappearance.</p>
<p>Police spokeswoman Nicole Hughes declined to say if the police had a suspect, but said they feared for Jaidyn's safety.</p>
<p>"We are still hopeful but obviously we have to look at every possible option," she told Reuters.</p>
