<p>The Chinese yuan closed down slightly at 8.2932 on Tuesday from Monday's 8.2929 against the U.S. dollar due to a technical correction, traders said.</p>
<p>The weighted average price on Monday was 8.2930.</p>
<p>Dealers said the correction had been expected after the yuan's steady rise over the past week with the rate now around a three-month high level.</p>
<p>The yuan opened little unchanged at 8.2930 and moved around the opening level for most of the session, hitting an intraday high of 8.2926 and a low of 8.2936. Trading was dull with most business done at 8.2929, traders said.  </p>
<p>One dealer said that while the yuan's upward momentum was weakening, pro-yuan sentiment remained strong.</p>
<p>A second dealer said the central bank seemed to have done little to depress the local currency over recent sessions.</p>
<p>"In the absense of central bank intervention, the yuan's upward trend is expected to continue after a short-lived correction," he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the yuan to move around the 8.2930 level on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The yuan ended up at 6.9300 from 6.9854 against 100 Japanese yen and unchanged at 1.0717 against the Hong Kong dollar.</p>
