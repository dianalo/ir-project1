<p>MidAmerican Energy Co said Tuesday it reached an agreement with Zond Development Corp to supply MidAmerican with wind-generated energy. Both companies are expected to sign the contract within a few days.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for Zond to supply to MidAmerican, on average, 45.3 megawatts of electricity per month for 20 years. Zond is required to begin supplying the energy to MidAmerican within three years after regulatory agencies approve the agreement.</p>
<p>Specific terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>Zond will supply the energy from about 150 wind turbines to be built in Buena Vista County, Iowa.</p>
<p>MidAmerican said the contract will fulfill the utility's requirement under Iowa law to buy 55 MW of electricity generated by alternate energy sources in Iowa. MidAmerican receives 10 MW of electricity from alternate energy producers in the state, including methane extracted from a landfill.</p>
