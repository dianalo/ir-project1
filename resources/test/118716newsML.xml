<p>Chubu Electric Power Co Inc said on Tuesday it had revised up the output capacity of its planned fifth nuclear reactor at Hamaoka by 22,000 kilowatts (kw) to 1.38 million kw.</p>
<p>Power production by the new reactor can be increased without raising its reactor capacity by employing advanced turbine wings, a spokesman for Chubu Electric said.</p>
<p>The new reactor would raise the total production capacity of the plant, on the Pacific coast, to five million kw.</p>
<p>Commercial operations at the unit are expected to start in August 2005, three months later than originally scheduled.  </p>
<p>Residents of Hamaoka, in Shizuoka Prefecture in central Japan, dropped their opposition against the construction of a new reactor earlier this month, enabling the utility to go ahead with its plan to build an advanced boiling water reactor.</p>
