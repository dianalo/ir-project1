<p>A local television station showed on Sunday a collection of photographs of the hostages in Lima, including a tense and pensive-looking Peruvian Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela.</p>
<p>Tudela, who earlier sounded calm when he spoke to another television station via walkie-talkie, was pictured concentrating hard as he leaned on a desk close to a window in the room where he is held captive at the Japanese ambassador's residence.</p>
<p>Marxist rebels from the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) have about 340 captives in the residence that they stormed on Tuesday during a cocktail party.</p>
<p>The photos confirmed the overcrowded, uncomfortable conditions inside the residence, but showed no evidence of health problems or ill-treatment by the rebels.</p>
<p>Peru's Supreme Court President Moises Pantoja was pictured sitting on the floor with his hand held thoughtfully to his face, while anti-terrorism police chief Gen. Maximo Riveras was reading a magazine together with another hostage.</p>
<p>Most of the men appeared to be still wearing the same elegant clothes they wore to Tuesday's party. They leaned on walls, slept on the floor or chatted easily among themselves.</p>
<p>It was not known how Channel Five obtained the photos. Those and another photo the channel released earlier were the first pictorial evidence of conditions in the interior of the house.</p>
