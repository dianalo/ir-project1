<p>Poland's amended 1997 budget draft envisages the deficit of 12.2 billion zlotys or 2.8 percent of gross domestic product, the finance ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>It said in a statement that after Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko amended the budget draft on Friday the spending level was set at 127.3 billion zlotys while revenues at 115.1 billion zlotys.</p>
<p>Kolodko earlier told a news conference that the resulting gap would be an equivalent of 2.8 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>The statement confirmed the draft envisaged lowering inflation in December next year to 13 percent from the current 19.5 percent.</p>
<p>Kolodko had to amend the budget draft to take into account a personal income tax cut approved by parliament on Thursday. His original budget draft proposal provided for a gap amounting to 2.6 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Parliament has until January 28 to pass the budget.</p>
