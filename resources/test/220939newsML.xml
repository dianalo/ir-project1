<p>Britain's customs service said on Wednesday it had arrested more than 40 people and seized shedloads of spirits in a nationwide crackdown on smuggling.</p>
<p>"It's the largest operation we have ever mounted," said Ranald Macdonald, spokesman for the National Investigation Service of Customs and Excise.</p>
<p>Five hundred officers from the service -- which chases drugs and criminal fraud -- spread across England overnight, issuing warrants from Newcastle in the north to Poole in the south.</p>
<p>More than 40 men and women, all British-based, were arrested. One hundred homes and businesses were inspected and "huge" consignments of smuggled beers, wines and spirits seized in warehouses around London, said Macdonald.</p>
<p>He estimated the cigarette and alcohol fraud, carried out by two inter-connected criminal gangs, had cost Britain more than 65 million pounds ($109 million) in lost revenue.</p>
<p>The alleged fraud was three-pronged, taking advantage of different tax levels both within the European Union and beyond.</p>
<p>The discrepancy has already spawned a huge legal trade in alcohol as Britons take daytrips to France to pack up their cars with beer and wine and avoid higher duties at home.</p>
<p>Macdonald said the two gangs had either bought duty-free goods that were intended for export but failed to export them, smuggled in low-price goods from the continent or else recovered duty paid on beer by falsely claiming it was to be sold abroad.</p>
<p>"They're variations on the same theme and they all represent concentrated attacks on the revenue system," said Macdonald.</p>
