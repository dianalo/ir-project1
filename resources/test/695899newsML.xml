<p>A train collided with a gasoline-laden tanker truck in a suburb of Mexico City on Monday, and the truck exploded in a giant fireball, police said.</p>
<p>Four police officers were the only people injured in the accident, they said.</p>
<p>Windows of a nearby hotel in the eastern suburb of Ecatepec were blown out when the burning remains of the tanker truck erupted in a large ball of flame, but no one in the hotel was reported injured.</p>
<p>"There were four people injured in the explosion, all of them police trying to clear people from the area, and only one of them is in serious condition," police commander Carlos Ortega told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the driver and a passenger of the tanker truck fled to safety shortly after the crash.</p>
<p>Charred remains of the tanker were thrown several hundred metres (yards) from the site of the crash, and the road on the side of the tracks was left smouldering with spilt gasoline.</p>
<p>The train consisted of the locomotive and one passenger car with six passengers, who were safely cleared from the area, police said.</p>
