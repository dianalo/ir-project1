<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle Thursday sold mostly at $64.00 per cwt in moderate volume in the central and southern Plains, with a few higher quality at $64.25, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>The bulk of Thursday's sales were steady with Wednesday, but up $1.00 from last week. An estimated 20,000 to 25,000 head sold in the Texas Panhandle/western Oklahoma area and about 30,000 in Kansas, sources in those areas said.</p>
<p>Owners had been asking $65.00 amid expectations sharply higher beef prices this week would lift fed cattle prices above $64.00, cattle feeders said.  </p>
<p>Outlooks for $65.00 also had been inspired by active trading in Nebraska Tuesday at $105.00-$106.00 on a dressed basis, up $2-$3 from last week's top and $65.50, with a few at $66.50 on a live basis, up $1.50-$2.50, they said.</p>
<p>Weekly sales in Nebraska were estimated near 115,000 head, above and beyond estimated showlists of 85,000 to 90,000.</p>
<p>Optimisim among owners faded on talk this week's higher beef prices were topping and that beef demand was on the verge of slowing down.</p>
<p>Beef prices were sharply higher this week amid tight stocks and moderate demand from retailers ordering for Independence Day holiday features, market sources said.</p>
