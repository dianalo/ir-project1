<p>It may not have the excitement of blaring trumpets, but in the big-money marketing world of toothpaste, shoring up a major product name clearly signals the start of a fight.</p>
<p>Procter &amp; Gamble Co., one of the nation's biggest spenders on advertising, has been moving on three fronts to bolster Crest, the country's largest-selling toothpaste brand. Crest has been clobbered in the last year by Colgate, the new Mentadent brand and some therapeutic brands.</p>
<p>Cincinnati-based P&amp;G started a new ad campaign in August for Crest Tartar Control, the star of its toothpaste line, and a two-for-one promotion in September for the same brand.</p>
<p>This marks the start of a revitalised marketing push for Crest and points to an increase in 1996 over the $40 million advertising budget spent last year by the company for Crest.</p>
<p>And, starting this month in Tulsa, Okla., P&amp;G has launched a test of a new product, Crest MultiCare. A company spokesman said the toothpaste "not only fights cavities and tartar but has a secret ingredient, which we are not disclosing."</p>
<p>The brand also "imparts a choice of fresh tastes" and "it is our first product to be striped." That will offer some new rivalry to Aquafresh, the SmithKline Beacham toothpaste which has been distinctive because of its three-level striping.</p>
<p>These moves by P&amp;G are seen in the industry and on Wall Street as defensive ones aimed at countering recent price competition from Colgate, as well as a new product entry from Colgate known as Colgate Total, which has a reported higher-than-average anti-microbial power.</p>
<p>When it starts distributing this product, which is already sold in many other countries, Colgate-Palmolive Co. could conceivably back the new marketing effort with a $60 million allotment, more than P&amp;G spent on the principal rival, Crest, last year.</p>
<p>So, it is clear that the lines are being drawn for a contest that could draw some blood, at least in terms of reduced sales revenues by either or both contestants.</p>
<p>Perhaps as much as Colgate's aggressiveness, Crest though still No. 1 in national sales, has been hurt by Mentadent, which for the first time in its field combined both baking soda and peroxide.</p>
<p>Its introduction in recent months not only heralded the entry into the toothpaste field of Unilever Plc's Lever Brothers but also created a rapidly-spreading market niche.</p>
<p>In an interview from Cincinnati, Don Tassone, a P&amp;G spokesman, said, "We took our eye off meaningful, consumer innovation. Competition became fierce and over the last two years we lost between eight to 10 market share points. But now, we are fully committed to recapturing our share and the Crest Multicare is our first step in getting back on track."</p>
<p>Tassone also sought to put the challenges facing Crest into a corporate context.</p>
<p>"While Crest is our largest brand, we also have an important pharmaceuticals business," he said. In over-the-counter products, P&amp;G "sees two primary franchises, Crest, our biggest, and Vicks, the respiratory product."</p>
<p>"We are putting new emphasis on getting the fundamentals right and in regaining our leadership with Crest," he said.</p>
<p>Although he said he could not comment on the dollar amount of P&amp;G's advertising, Tassone confirmed that it will be higher than 1995's $40 million.</p>
<p>In one way, the company may now also be trying in its new and perhaps later moves to rectify a two-year old mistake. In 1994, P&amp;G introduced its Crest Gum Care with stannous fluoride and said that the product was being offered nationally in place of a baking soda and peroxide product.</p>
<p>But Crest Gum Care has disappointed P&amp;G, a factor that has been dramatically underscored by the success of the recent Mentadent brand.</p>
<p>The baking soda-peroxide niche represented by Mentadent and similar products is said to represent about 25 percent of the $1.5 billion toothpaste market.</p>
<p>For its part, Colgate-Palmolive is hardly standing by passively as Colgate makes its counter-offensive. Anne Crawford, Colgate's director of investor relations, said that the company had "meaningfully" increased its advertising for Colgate in 1996 although she would not be more specific.</p>
