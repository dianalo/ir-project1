<p>World number 19 Tim Henman came perilously close to a second consecutive first-round loss before beating Spanish wild card entry Sergi Bruguera 6-3 4-6 6-4 in the European Community tennis championship on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The rising British player, who was knocked out by German qualifier Martin Sinner in the first round of last week's Dubai Open, made a fluent start.</p>
<p>He appeared to be heading for a smooth victory over former French Open winner Bruguera until his concentration wavered towards the end of the second set.</p>
<p>"I wasn't able to finish the job off and that's where I probably made life difficult for myself," Henman said.</p>
<p>He only recovered his poise midway through the final set and made a decisive service break in the ninth game with a scorching passing shot down the line.</p>
<p>He served out the match with an ace in the next game after just two hours.</p>
<p>"I was able to hang in there and got my opportunity in the third (set) and was able to hang on to it. I'm pleased to come through a match like that. I needed it," said Henman, who won his first professional title in Sydney last month.</p>
<p>Henman, 22, plays Swede Mikael Tillstrom in the second round in their first ever encounter.</p>
<p>Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev went down 7-6 6-2 to former Olympic champion Marc Rosset of Switzerland in another first round match after wasting a 5-2 lead in the first set.</p>
<p>"I didn't capitalise on the chances I had in the first set," said Medvedev, who rose to a career-high world ranking of four in 1994 before suffering wrist, back and shoulder injuries which prevented him from recapturing his best form.</p>
<p>"Once Rosset won the first set he got more confident and started playing some really good tennis," said Medvedev, who is now ranked 29th in the world.</p>
<p>The top four seeds, including Croatian Goran Ivanisevic and German Boris Becker, enter the fray on Wednesday.</p>
