<p>Russian farms, privatised in name but barely touched by six years of market reforms, face future perils as the reformist cabinet leans toward scrapping the old Soviet system of multi-billion dollar handouts.</p>
<p>Forecasts of a recovery in grain output this year largely reflect better weather conditions and not the structural changes the crippled farm sector needs if Russia is to feed itself and rebuild livestock numbers.</p>
<p>"On the grains side, we inevitably come back to the word 'potential'," said a senior Western grains source.</p>
<p>"Russia, and Kazakhstan and Ukraine, could be huge producers. But on the inputs side, it's a total disaster."</p>
<p>Market analysts are pleased the Russian crop will not slip on last year's 69.3 million tonnes and could even make a comeback to 75 or million or more after two of the worst harvests in three decades.</p>
<p>But the fact that weather is the reason for the recovery is troubling analysts, especially with the state ready to cut funding further next year.</p>
<p>Only one third of Russia's farms are thriving, and the lack of vertical integration since central planning collapsed in 1991 has left farmers scrambling each year for seeds, fertiliser and fuel.</p>
<p>Most farms, functionally no different from the kolkhoz collective farms from which they emerged, bargain away output for inputs and are mired in inefficiency.</p>
<p>Many farmers, with no hope of bank financing, are no better off than their 19th-century serf predecessors.</p>
<p>"It's not going to turn around overnight," said a senior agriculture source in Moscow. "But the dramatic decline was in the early 1990s and now we're starting to see a little bit of a turnaround, although nothing dramatic."</p>
<p>The newly reformist Finance Ministry, which poured $96 billion equivalent into the sector as recently as 1991, has warned that such weighty handouts will not continue, saying the next budget would allot a puny $470 million equivalent.</p>
<p>Analysts say this could spell disaster if bad weather strikes.</p>
<p>Russian farm output has halved since 1991, with last year's grain output down 53 percent on peak levels of 130 million tonnes or more in the late 1970s.</p>
<p>Not even First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, the former governor of the Nizhny Novogorod region, has been able to touch the sector on a national scale, though he has forecast the grain harvest rising to 80 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Nizhny Novgorod, home to the first farm to go private, has not been able to transplant its experimental model to other regions.</p>
<p>But the government, increasingly out of the picture of financing farms and food imports, has not imported grain for the past three or so years and would not do so this year, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Friday.</p>
<p>That is because Russia is eating less and has fewer cattle to feed, since farmers find it more economical to slaughter livestock than to purchase grains to feed them.</p>
<p>Russia once spent much of its oil export revenues on multi-million-tonne grain imports. But agriculture analysts reiterate the government will not be a presence on world grain markets this year.</p>
<p>"What has struck us most is the collapse in the livestock numbers and the drawdown in the inputs," said the senior Western grains source.</p>
<p>Russia already imports around 40 percent of its food needs, soaking up lower-value meat products unwanted in the West, like dark poultry meat and even ox liver.</p>
<p>"The processing industry is in a very sorry state," the source said. "To what extent will Russians rely on domestic output?"</p>
