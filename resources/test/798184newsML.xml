<p>A Turkish government spokesman said on Wednesday an additional budget planned to fill a shortfall in the main 1997 budget may amount to 2,000 trillion lira ($12.2 billion).</p>
<p>"It is thought that the additional budget may be around 2,000 trillion lira," spokesman Ahat Andican told a news conference.  </p>
<p>The previous Islamist-led government, replaced by a right-left coalition at the end of June, had slated a balanced budget for 1997.</p>
<p>Economists expected the full-year deficit to be 2,500 trillion lira after a deficit of 681.7 trillion in the first half.</p>
<p>Speaking on the outcome of a cabinet meeting on Tuesday evening, Andican said the supplementary budget would be brought before parliament after the summer recess around the start of October.</p>
<p>The new secularist government under Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz is looking to accelerate privatisations and tap foreign markets for borrowing to help offset the country's financial imbalances.</p>
