<p>Croatian police have arrested a Bosnian Croat warlord and five other men in an apparent crackdown on organised crime in the divided town of Mostar, Western diplomats and state media said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mladen Naletilic, also known as Tuta, was arrested on Monday near the town of Split in southern Croatia and brought to a prison in Zagreb for questioning, the state news agency HINA quoted the Interior Ministry as saying.</p>
<p>Naletilic, often accused by international mediators of having connections with organised crime in Mostar, was arrested "on a well-founded suspicion that he was involved in committing a criminal act liable to official prosecution", the police told Hina without specifying the nature of the act.</p>
<p>Michael Steiner, deputy to the international High Representative to Bosnia, confirmed reports that a leading warlord from western Mostar had been arrested and he welcomed the news.</p>
<p>"All indications which we have so far is that one very senior criminal figure has been arrested," Steiner told Reuters. "If this is so, if he is kept under arrest and out of his position of power, I can only warmly welcome that."</p>
<p>Steiner said his office had received reports that up to 20 people had been arrested in the apparent crackdown on the nationalist mafia known to rule western Mostar.</p>
<p>A diplomat in Sarajevo said another prominent warlord in Croat-held western Mostar, Vinko Martinovic, had escaped arrest.</p>
<p>In another indication things may be changing in Mostar, HINA reported that Croat police there on Wednesday seized five men, all Croats, for armed robbery and issued arrest warrants for another three.</p>
<p>Witnesses said there was a heavy police on Wednesday evening including special units on the road towards Split.</p>
<p>The arrests coincided with Western pressure on the Croatian government to bring into line ethnic Croats in Herzegovina, who oppose building joint political institutions with their nominal Moslem allies in the Bosnian Federation.</p>
<p>Another Western source told Reuters Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has probably been asked by senior diplomats this week "to remove once and for all" the gangsters in Mostar.</p>
<p>Steiner said the arrests could represent a turning point in Croatia's approach to its proteges in Bosnia.</p>
<p>He said the gangs had obscured legitimate political concerns of Bosnian Croats, who say their rights are not protected in the Moslem-Croat federation. "I think there is a growing realisation (in Zagreb) that in the end these criminal structures there hurt the Croat people the most."</p>
<p>Croatia's state television, the mouthpiece for Tudjman and his ruling HDZ party, last week aired a commentary containing the first veiled criticism of Croat mafia in Mostar in years.</p>
<p>International police investigators reported on Tuesday that Bosnian Croat police fired on unarmed Moslems without cause and behaved in a criminal manner in a February 10 incident in which a Moslem civilian was killed and around 20 wounded in Mostar.</p>
<p>Naletilic and Martinovic have frequently been accused by Western mediators of being at the centre of a powerful mafia cartel that runs western Mostar and opposes international efforts for a stable peace in the region.</p>
<p>During the Bosnian war Naletilic commanded a notorious paramilitary unit of former convicts which operated in the Mostar area. Paramilitary units connected with mafia are held largely responsible for lawlessness in western Mostar, especially for the continuous evictions of Moslem inhabitants.</p>
