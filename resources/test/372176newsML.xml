<p>The on-going strike by Colombia's public sector workers led to a 10 percent cut in pumping operations along the country's pipelines Wednesday, a senior official of the state-run oil company Ecopetrol said.</p>
<p>But Alberto Merlano, vice-chairman of personnel, said refining at the main Barrancabermeja plant was back to normal after gasoline output fell 15 percent Tuesday -- the first day of the indefinite strike. Crude production was unaffected, he said.  </p>
<p>Merlano conceded that pumping operations had been reduced by as much as 20 percent Tuesday despite initial Ecopetrol claims that the strike, which involves members of the 7,000-strong main oil workers' union USO, had had no impact.</p>
<p>Gustavo Triana, a senior USO representative, said the Ecopetrol figure on the fall in pumping activities was accurate and agreed refining at Barrancabermeja appeared to be getting back to normal after workers handed back the keys to the plant after a 24-hour occupation which ended Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>Union leaders representing the estimated 800,000 striking workers are due to meet government ministers Thursday at 7 a.m. (1200 GMT) to restart negotiations aimed at ending the strike.</p>
<p>But they insist the work stoppage will continue until the government has given firm guarantees on labor demands, which include a 21.5 percent pay hike, an end to planned privatizations of regional and national industries and changes in what they say is a repressive labor code.</p>
