<p>NYMEX electricity futures eased Wednesday along with lower physical power prices in the U.S. West, following a strong surge in power futures Tuesday, industry sources said.</p>
<p>"We're coming off to some more reasonable prices here," said one New York based futures trader.</p>
<p>Physical power prices in the West were also reported to be easing Wednesday from the strong values late last week which were said to be based primarily on cooling demand in the Southwest.</p>
<p>Next-day peak Palo Verde (PV) delivery was assessed at $25.00-29.00 from $30.00-35.00 on Tuesday, while next-day peak California Oregon Border (COB) was pegged near $24.50 from $24.50-26.50 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Physical demand has been the primary driver behind the futures," the New York trader said.</p>
<p>As of 1245 EDT, June PV NYMEX futures were down $2.41 at $27.40 from trade in a range of $27.25-28.80, while July PV was down $1.75 at $28.75 following trade at $28.25-29.50 per megawatt hour (MWh).</p>
<p>June COB was down $1.91 at $20.50 after trade at $20.00-21.00, while July COB was down $1.25 at the day's low of $21.00 after trade as high as $21.50 per MWh.</p>
<p>Power futures surged strongly Tuesday, with market sources citing upward pressure from Southwestern cooling demand, generation unit outages, and strong physical power prices.</p>
<p>As of 1240 EDT, June Henry Hub futures were trading down 0.5 cents at $2.186 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>Extended forecasts showed temperatures in the Northwest would average above normal to well-above normal over the next several days.</p>
<p>Readings in the eastern area of the Southwest would run near normal, while those in western area would average above normal.</p>
<p>Separately, Bonneville Power Administration said the DC lines on the Pacific Intertie will be reduced by as much as 414 megawatts (MW) this week for scheduled maintenance, while the AC portion will be lowered by 400 MW today.</p>
<p>At least 7,000 MW of power remained off line in the West for either planned or unplanned maintenance, although a much of the capacity was expected to return to operation over the next several weeks.</p>
<p>As part of the service resumptions, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's 1,087 MW Diablo Canyon 1 was scheduled to begin production May 25 after completing a scheduled refueling and maintenance outage which began April 19.</p>
