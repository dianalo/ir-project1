<p>The Finnish markka is expected to inch a couple of penni stronger against the German mark in the next three months, according to a Reuters poll.</p>
<p>In March next year, the markka is seen back near its current levels around 2.99 per mark and DEM/FIM is seen trading in a 2.90-3.05 range during the coming 12 months.</p>
<p>A large majority of respondents, 19 of 23 dealers, analysts and economists, forecast DEM/FIM in a 2.95-2.99 range until June. The median was 2.95 and the mean 2.96.</p>
<p>Two market operators expected DEM/FIM to fall to 2.90 and two saw it at 3.00 by the beginning of June.</p>
<p>Against the dollar, the markka was expected to trade close to its current levels at 5.05 in the next three months. The median forecast was 5.05 in a 4.75-5.16 range. The mean was 5.03.</p>
<p>Six respondents estimated USD/FIM to fall below 5.00, while four saw it rising to 5.15-5.16.</p>
<p>Looking one year ahead, the median forecast for DEM/FIM was 3.01 in a 2.75-3.07 range. The mean was 2.99.</p>
<p>Four participants forecast the markka at 2.90 or below by March 1998 but most, 15 of the 23, expected the markka to be in a range of 3.00-3.04 per mark. One bank forecast DEM/FIM at 3.07.</p>
<p>When asked about the DEM/FIM trading range during the coming 12 months, the median forecast of lows was 2.90, while that of highs stood at 3.05.</p>
<p>The range of DEM/FIM lows forecasts was 2.70-2.94 and that of highs 2.98-3.13.</p>
<p>Six respondents expected lows to be under 2.90. Seven estimated highs of 3.06 or above.</p>
<p>The markka was expected to gain against the dollar by next March. The median of USD/FIM forecasts was 4.92 in a 4.50-5.45 range. The mean was 4.94.</p>
