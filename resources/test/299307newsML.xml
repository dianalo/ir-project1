<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog buyers and livestock dealers said price direction Monday would depend on the weather.</p>
<p>Cold, snow and shocking wind chills in much of the Corn Belt Friday sharply curtailed hog movement, with many country roads made impassable by blizzard conditions from South Dakota to Indiana. The cold was expected to last through the weekend.</p>
<p>If temperatures moderate Monday, prices could slip as producers ship hogs held back by the weather, they said.</p>
<p>"We could get in a lot of hogs if it moderates," said one dealer in central Indiana.  </p>
<p>Top prices for hogs delivered to the plant in Iowa could range $54.50 to $55.00 and top prices for Illinois hogs at the plant could span $54.00-$54.50. Indiana/Ohio top prices at the plant could range $53.00-$53.50, the dealers said.</p>
<p>Slaughter and processing were also blunted by the difficulty in getting hogs and employees to the plant. USDA Friday pegged slaughter at 247,000 head, compared with 325,000 on Thursday and 361,000 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa/southern Minnesota hog marketings were estimated at 60,000 head, compared with 111,000 a week ago and 113,000 a year ago, according to USDA.</p>
