<p>The Finance Committee of Hong Kong's Legislative Council (Legco) has voted to extend funding to keep the territory's proposed pension scheme alive, a Legco spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The committee voted by a margin of 31 to 19 to extend to the Mandatory Provident Fund office the HK$25 million (US$3.2 million) that will keep it operational for the 13 months from March, allowing it to complete its work.</p>
<p>The MPF office is charged with recommending guidelines to balance the risks and returns of MPF investments.</p>
<p>The MPF as planned would require individual employees and employers to each contribute five percent of a monthly salary to a retirement fund.</p>
<p>On January 29, the establishment sub-committee of the Legco Finance Committee voted by a margin of 11 to six to deny funding to the MPF office.</p>
<p>Opponents of the MPF charged that workers' assets would be at risk because the funds would be managed by the private sector rather than by the Hong Kong government.</p>
<p>Some said they preferred a system similar to Singapore's Centralised Provident Fund.</p>
<p>Opponents also expressed fears that lower-paid workers would be left out of the scheme and about the plan's cost.</p>
<p>Since the funding was voted down by the sub-committee in January, the MPF office has made concessions to soothe the opposition's concerns about the scheme.</p>
<p>For example, the MPF office has said that it may be possible to design a scheme that would offer guaranteed returns.</p>
<p>The plan also could include rules that would bar scheme providers from rejecting any clients.</p>
