<p>The 15-day-old wage strike at the paper division of Mondi, a subsidiary of Anglo American Industrial Corporation Ltd, could spread to some 100 other companies in KwaZulu-Natal, a union official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The legal strike at the group's Merebank mill was called by the Paper, Printing, Wood and Allied Workers' Union (PPAWU) to push for wage increases in excess of management's nine percent offer.</p>
<p>"On Wednesday and Thursday next week about 7,000 workers belonging to PPWAWU at 100 companies in KwaZulu-Natal will come out on a sympathy or secondary strike," union spokesman Lucky Mhlongo told a news conference.</p>
<p>Affected companies could include Consol Ltd, Kohler Ltd, Nampak Ltd and Sappi Ltd, he said, adding that other divisions of Mondi would also be affected.</p>
<p>"There is a definite possibility that this will become a matter of national interest," Mhlongo added.</p>
<p>About 640 of the mill's 1,324 workers are on strike.</p>
<p>The mill is operating at least four of five machines that produce up to 500,000 tonnes of paper a year and customer demands are being met, according to company statements since the strike began.</p>
<p>However, a shop steward on the union's negotiating team said the company was transgressing safety rules by using undertrained staff to operate the machines and the quality of the paper produced was questionable.</p>
<p>Documentation from court proceedings aimed at obtaining an interdict against the striking workers indicated that the company stood to lose up to four million rand a day in turnover due to the strike.</p>
<p>Management was not immediately available for comment.</p>
