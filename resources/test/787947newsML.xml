<p>Hershey Foods Corp. said Friday it has bought 9.9 million shares of its common stock from the Hershey Trust Co. for $50.50 a share or about $500 million.</p>
<p>The maker of chocolates, pasta and grocery products said that Hershey Trust, as trustee of the Milton Hershey School Trust, has advised it that the trust intends to retain voting control of the corporation, which it has held since 1918.</p>
<p>The trust sold the shares to diversify the school trust's investment holdings, the company said.</p>
<p>Milton Hershey, founder of Hershey Foods, and his wife, Catherine, established the school trust in 1909. The income of the school trust is used to pay the full cost of education and care for the students of the Milton Hershey School in Hershey, Pa., a private nonprofit boarding school for needy children.</p>
<p>The Hershey Trust will continue to review the school trust's holdings and undertake further diversification as it deems appropriate, Hershey said. The trust has no intention of selling additional shares, it added.</p>
<p>With the transaction, Hershey Trust now holds 76.0 percent of the voting power of both classes of Hershey Food's common stock. Before the transaction, it held 76.5 percent.</p>
<p>Hershey's stock fell 50 cents to $52.31 on the New York Stock Exchange in late trading.</p>
