<title>USA: Lawmakers urge Clinton to fill top FAA job.</title>

<p>Fifty lawmakers wrote to President Clinton Friday urging him to fill the top job at the Federal Aviation Administration with a committed, experienced aviation safety advocate.</p>
<p>"We need a firm hand at the helm of the nation's airline industry watchdog," said Rep. Peter DeFazio, a Democrat from Oregon who led the group signing the letter.</p>
<p>The job of FAA administrator has been vacant since late last year when David Hinson retired.</p>
<p>Senior administration sources said recently that Jane Garvey, former director of Boston's Logan Airport and acting head of the Federal Highway administration, would be named to the job.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for DeFazio said there was no implied criticism of Garvey in the letter. "We've heard several names. We would welcome an appointment."</p>
<p>Congress eliminated the FAA's dual charter last year by removing the aviation promotion role and defining its principal mission as air safety.</p>
<p>That followed sharp criticism of the agency after the crash just over a year ago of Valujet flight 592 near Miami, killing all 110 people aboard.</p>
<p>"It is disturbing to us that despite this clear mandate, the FAA's record is still inconsistent, at best," the lawmakers wrote.</p>
<p>The FAA was criticised again this week for not moving quickly to require airlines to fit fire detection and suppression systems in cargo holds.</p>
<p>The ValuJet flight crashed after a fire in the cargo hold. Oxygen generators were blamed for the fire. The FAA has since banned their transport on commercial airliners.</p>
<p>But the head of the NTSB disclosed this week that Continental Airlines last month unknowingly carried a shipment of generators similar to those in the ValuJet accident.</p>
