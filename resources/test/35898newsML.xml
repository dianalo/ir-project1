<p>The nation's savings and loans earned a record $1.89 billion in the second quarter, up from $1.35 billion a year earlier, regulators said Thursday.</p>
<p>The Office of Thrift Supervision attributed the performance to a strong economy, favorable interest rates, better quality assets, and reduced losses among the 1,397 thrifts the agency regulates.  </p>
<p>Last quarter's profits eclipsed the previous record of $1.83 billion reported for the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>"The improvement in profitability has been widespread," Kenneth Ryder, head of research and analysis at the OTS, told a press conference.</p>
<p>For the first six months of 1996, net income was a record $3.72 billion, up from $2.5 billion in the first half of 1995.</p>
<p>Return on average assets was 99 basis points in the second quarter, the highest level since 1959, the OTS said. The ROA was up from 96 basis points in the first quarter and 70 basis points in the second quarter of last year.  </p>
<p>The OTS said the number of thrifts and total deposits used to fund their assets continued to fall.</p>
<p>The agency said the drop in deposits was especially sharp at the 1,370 thrifts that belong to the Savings Association Insurance Fund (SAIF), the fund that protects depositors against losses at failed S&amp;Ls.</p>
<p>Those thrifts reported deposits falling 6.7 percent on an annualized basis to $454.2 billion at the end of June from $470 billion at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>Deposits now fund just 68.1 percent of thrifts' assets, an all-time-low.  </p>
<p>The higher insurance premium that SAIF-insured thrifts pay on deposits has contributed to greater use of other borrowings to fund thrift assets.</p>
<p>The OTS counted 33 thrifts on its list of "problem" institutions at the end of the second quarter, down from 37 in the first quarter. Assets held by problem thrifts fell to $7 billion from $11 billion in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Troubled assets fell to $9.3 billion, or 1.21 percent of total assets, in the second quarter, from $9.7 billion, or 1.27 percent, in the first quarter.</p>
