<p>Louisiana police on Friday were holding five teenagers from a self-styled "vampire clan" wanted in a double murder of one of the teen's parents in central Florida, officials said.</p>
<p>Police from the Lake County, Florida, sheriff's department arrived in Baton Rouge on Friday to begin questioning 15-year old Heather Wendorf and four other teenagers captured while trying to check into a downtown hotel Thanksgiving Day.</p>
<p>The five teenagers were arrested on warrants charging first-degree murder in the bludgeoning deaths of Richard Wendorf, 49, and his wife Ruth Wendorf, 54, whose bodies were discovered by police late on Monday in their home in Eustis, Florida, about 25 miles north of Orlando, police said.</p>
<p>The teenagers were first reported missing in Murray, Kentucky, a small town near the western tip of Kentucky where they were known as members of "The Vampire Clan," a tight-knit, secretive group suspected of sucking blood from small animals and each other in graveyard rituals.</p>
<p>"They like to cut their arms and suck the blood out of each other's arms," said Murray Police Sgt. Mike Jump. "In a ritual in a remote graveyard, they've been known to kill a small animal and suck the blood out of it, supposedly to give them more power."</p>
<p>On the run since warrants were issued on Wednesday, the teenagers were arrested after a Baton Rouge patrol officer spotted the Wendorf's 1994 blue Ford Explorer pulling into the parking lot of the hotel.</p>
<p>"Apparently one of the suspects made a telephone call yesterday afternoon from Baton Rouge which was traced here, and we located the pay phone from where the call originated," Baton Rouge police spokesman Don Kelly said.</p>
<p>Extradition procedures were expected to begin on Monday to send the teenagers back to Florida. "We're definitely going to get the juveniles back to Florida to stand trial," said Sgt. Cecil Garrett of the Lake County Sheriff's Department.</p>
<p>Autopsies showed Wendorf's parents both died of attacks to the head with a blunt instrument. There were no ritualistic signs connected with the deaths, deaths, police said.</p>
