<headline>Weiss, Peck to launch global software stock fund.</headline>

<p>Weiss, Peck &amp; Greer LLC said on Monday it would launch a limited partnership hedge fund called WPG Software Fund LP, which would invest in equities in the global software sector.</p>
<p>The fund, managed by Ben Taylor, would invest across all segments of the software industry, with a particular focus on attractive lower-capitalization software companies.</p>
<p>"The basic thesis is that software has always been a great growth area and will continue to be a great growth area," Taylor said.  "It has the magic combination of growth and profitability."  </p>
<p>He said on a cumulative basis, software had been the best performing industry group over the past 15 years.  He said it was also one of the least volatile technology sectors.</p>
<p>The software industry would continue to grow as it provided traditional data analysis functions, and also served as a new communications tool, Taylor said.</p>
<p>Focusing on value-oriented, bottom-up security selection, the WPG Software Fund would emphasize growth at a reasonable price and temporarily depressed or undervalued stocks, especially micro and small capitalization issues.  It would also opportunistically employ short positions, Taylor said.  </p>
<p>The fund would try to remain fully invested in about 25 securities, choosing both international and domestic, and large and small software companies from the roughly 600 firms in the sector, Taylor said.</p>
<p>The fund would be open to institutional and individual investors starting September 30 and would limit the initial closing to $100 million, Weiss, Peck said.</p>
<p>While Taylor declined to comment on particular stocks, he said: "We believe we can make outsized returns by finding diamonds in the rough among the smaller-cap names."</p>
<p>International software companies would comprise about 10 percent to 15 percent of the equities in the fund, he said.</p>
<p>WPG Software Fund would seek to outperform the Goldman Sachs Technology Industry Software index.</p>
<p>Prior to joining WPG, Taylor spent five years as an analyst and portfolio manager in a limited partnership environment with an emphasis on software, including two years at RH Capital and three years at Centennial Associates.</p>
<p>Weiss, Peck is based in New York and provides investment management, private equity, venture capital and clearing services.  It manages over $14 billion in assets.</p>
