<headline>Spanish judge asks for Argentine "dirty war" files.</headline>

<p>A Spanish judge has asked the country's espionage agency to turn over any information it has about Spaniards who disappeared in Argentina's "dirty war", court sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Spanish daily El Mundo reported last week that Spain's military intelligence agency CESID had microfilmed copies of secret documents listing thousands of people who had been kidnapped, tortured and killed under Argentine military juntas.</p>
<p>National High Court Judge Baltasar Garzon, known for handling some of Spain's highest-profile cases, is investigating the disappearence of hundreds of Spaniards in Argentina from 1976-1983.</p>
<p>The sources said he asked CESID whether it had any information on the missing Spaniards and if so, whether the documents were secret. He requested any information be made available to him to help in his investigation.</p>
<p>The Spanish embassy in Buenos Aires told the Argentinian government at the weekend that Madrid did not know about the existence of any such list in Spain, a foreign ministry official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>At least 10,000 people were killed in the Argentine military dictatorship's campaign against leftist guerrillas. Many of the victims were kidnapped and tortured before their bodies were dumped out of military planes over the sea.</p>
<p>Argentina asked Spain for information last week after El Mundo reported that files listing victims were flown in eight green tin trunks to Spain in 1983, where they were microfilmed by Spanish intelligence before being stored in a safe deposit box in a Swiss bank where they allegedly remain.</p>
<p>The Argentine military denied any knowledge of the files, but former navy officer Adolfo Scilingo said on Friday senior officers had lists of victims.</p>
<p>Last month, Garzon issued an international arrest warrant for former Argentine military president Leopoldo Galtieri for his alleged role in the killing of three Spaniards during the "dirty war".</p>
