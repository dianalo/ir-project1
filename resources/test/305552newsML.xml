<p>Ecuadoran student protests against big rises in the cost of public services ended in violence on Tuesday, as police fired tear gas at demonstrators around Quito's Central University.</p>
<p>"Two people were wounded. Someone fired and a young man was wounded in the arm, while another was hit in the eye by a tear gas canister," a Reuters photographer on the scene said.</p>
<p>The students were protesting against increases in electricity, telephone, gas and transport charges announced by President Abdala Bucaram as part of an austerity plan.</p>
<p>Ecuadoran unions said on Monday they were considering a general strike on Feb. 5 against Bucaram's tough economic reforms, which include scrapping subsidies to public services.</p>
<p>Domestic gas prices have shot up by 250 percent and electricity by more than 100 percent. Bus fares have doubled and telephone rates have also increased substantially.</p>
<p>Opposition parties are considering forming a united front against the tariff rises and a planned currency convertibility programme that would peg the sucre to the U.S. dollar.</p>
