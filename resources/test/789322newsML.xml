<p>Most shares of South Korea's KIA group went limit-up in late Friday afternoon trading as a rumour that the chairman of the troubled group would resign sparked buying, brokers said.</p>
<p>But the talk was denied by a group spokesman.  </p>
<p>Kia Motors rose 1,000 won to 14,000, Kia Steel added 250 to 3,420, Asia Motors gained 360 to 4,860, Kisan climbed 380 to 5,180 and Kia Motor Sales rose 370 to 5,090.</p>
<p>Kia Precision, was the only Kia share not hitting limit high. It rose 710 to 10,500.</p>
<p>"There is a rumour in the market that Kia's chairman would resign soon," said Park Joo-chang of Daewoo Securities. "Investors believe the group could be normalised with the supply of emergency funds."</p>
<p>Creditors to the group have promised to extend emergency loans to the group if its top executives tender resignation letters.</p>
<p>Some brokers said investors bought Kia shares in bargain hunting following their steep fall earlier this week.</p>
