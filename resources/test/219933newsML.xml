<p>Chilean blue chips ended lower with electricity shares among the leading decliners, said traders.</p>
<p>The market is seen opening slightly weaker although turnover will be light due to Wall Street's closure for the Thanksgiving Day holiday, they said.</p>
<p>The 40-share IPSA index closed down 0.43 percent at 93.93 points. The general IGPA index shed 0.73 percent at 5,139.32 points amid turnover of nearly 12 billion pesos.  </p>
<p>Traders said there was no clear reason for Wednesday's fall, which dragged stocks through the previous support level of 94 points.</p>
<p>"There is no fundamental reason for the fall. I don't think it is justified, as Chilean stocks are already very cheap," said Pablo Salcedo, head of research at ING Barings.</p>
<p>Electricity shares continued to slide on fears over the impact of a drought on fourth quarter earnings of hydro- electric generating firms, said traders.</p>
<p>Low water levels in their dams mean these producers are having to buy high-cost power from other thermal generators.  </p>
<p>Endesa, Chile's largest hydro-power producer, ended off 1.26 percent at 235/34 pesos.</p>
<p>Traders said a widely expected sharp cut in power distribution prices has already been factored into electricity stock prices.</p>
<p>An announcement of the new power rates has been delayed by a legal dispute between the government and distributor Chilectra over the method of calculating the new prices.</p>
<p>Winners included winery Concha y Toro, up 0.52 percent at 194-1/2 pesos, and brewery CCU, which rose 0.32 percent to 1,580 pesos.</p>
