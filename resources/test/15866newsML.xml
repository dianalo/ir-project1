<p>Short-term trading rates on Zimbabwe's money market slipped marginally in Tuesday's flush market, with dealers expecting liquidity to be further boosted on maturity of grain bills later in the day.</p>
<p>"A number of grain bills are maturing today and indications are that they are not going to be renewed and that should add substantial liquidity to the system," one dealer commented.</p>
<p>Dealers continued shrugging off any possible immediate impact on the market of an going wrangle between civil servants and President Robert Mugabe's government over salary increments, but did not rule out negative repercussions in the long-term.</p>
<p>"The civil servant strike hasn't had any effect on the market so far, but maybe in the long-term investor confidence might be undermined, once government has established its losses from the strike action," commented one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile on Tuesday, NCD bills maturing after 30, 60 and 90 days were being bought softer at 24 percent from 24.75 and sold at 23 percent from 23.5 percent while bankers acceptance bills were at 23.5 and 22.75 from 23.5 and 23 percent.</p>
<p>Call money was quoted stable at around 22.5 percent in a market which opened with Z$360 million surplus.</p>
