<p>Here are the rules of succession in Russia if President Boris Yeltsin dies on the operating table or if worsening health problems prevent him from carrying out his duties.</p>
<p>Under the constitution Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, now in temporary control of the world's biggest country, would run Russia for three months if the president was unable to work properly. Then new presidential elections must be held.</p>
<p>"The president of the Russian Federation stops exercising his duties early if he resigns, shows a lasting inability to carry out his duties due to ill health or if he is impeached," the constitution says.</p>
<p>The post-Soviet constitution, adopted in December 1993, gives the president strong powers, but makes impeachment -- a complicated, multi-stage procedure -- unlikely.</p>
<p>But Russian legislation does not cite any precise reasons why a president should resign and it contains no procedures to determine whether he is incapable of carrying out his duties for health reasons.</p>
<p>The constitution does, however, say that the upper house of parliament should call an early election if the president dies, is incapacitated through illness or if he resigns.</p>
<p>"The day of the election should be the last Sunday before the expiry of three months from the moment when the president resigns," the law on presidential elections says.</p>
<p>The prime minister deputises for the president during this period, but he cannot dissolve parliament, call referendums or propose amendments to the constitution.</p>
<p>Russian legislation does not specify the next in the line of succession if the acting president dies or steps down before an early election is held.</p>
