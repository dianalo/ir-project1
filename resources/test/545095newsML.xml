<p>Westfield America Trust said on Monday it planned to raise up to about A$315 million in its proposed listing on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Westfield said an updated draft prospectus for the capital raising by Westfield America Inc has been lodged with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>The prospectus provides for a capital issue of 18 million shares at a price range of US$16.00 to US$17.50, raising US288 million to US$315 million.  </p>
<p>Westfield America said previously it would look to raise about US$400 million.</p>
<p>Westfield America said also it had entered into conditional agreements to buy interests in two U.S. shopping malls for US$185.5 million.</p>
<p>Westfield America plans to buy the remaining 70 percent interest in its Annapolis Mall and adjoining land for US$133 million, and a 70 percent partnership interest in Wheaton Plaza in Maryland for US$52.5 million.  </p>
<p>Westfield Holdings Ltd, Australia's largest shopping centre owner, announced in March plans for its U.S. arm to list in New York.</p>
<p>Under the plan, Westfield America Trust would list its U.S. vehicle CenterMark Properties Inc as Westfield America Inc, diluting its 67.2 percent stake in CenterMark to about 50 percent.</p>
<p>Westfield chairman Frank Lowy told shareholders at an extraordinary general meeting earlier this month that the company was contemplating certain acquisitions.</p>
