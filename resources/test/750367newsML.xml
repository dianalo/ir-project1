<headline>EMS/Mark steadier but continues to probe lows.</headline>
<text>
<p>1450 GMT - The pace of the mark's early slide on non-EMU crosses slows but it continues to hover just above session lows vs Swiss and probing even lower vs Swedish and Norwegian crowns.</p>
<p>* Mark off lows vs dollar, stg and yen but dollar/mark continues to prowl just shy of near 6-yr high set earlier as Dow stays buoyant while Greenspan gives part two of Humphrey Hawkins.</p>
<p>* Mark/Sweden falls to lowest since Dec 1992 at 4.2795, Mark/Norway falls to lowest since May 2 at 4.1030. Mark/Swiss just off lowest since Aug 1996, set at 0.8108 earlier.</p>
<p>* Market increasingly convinced of broad-based, punctual EMU and seeking for non-EMU floating currencies as havens for now.</p>
<p>* Traders say no sign of Bundesbank or any other central bank supporting the mark, either actively or verbally. Buba council meeting Thursday eyed, may temper mark losses for now.</p>
<p>* Germany's Hesse, Bavaria and NRW show bigger-than- expected 0.5 pct rise in July CPI. No Bundesbak reaction seen.</p>
<p>* France's Strauss-Kahn says EMU criteria about convergence not exact targets, sees Italy, Spain and Portugal in EMU first wave and says all indications are that euro will be stable.</p>
<p>* Mark/Paris at 3.3708/13 vs 3.3687/90 late Tuesday. Mark/lira at 971.95/05 vs 971.75/05 late yesterday.</p>
