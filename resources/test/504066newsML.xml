<title>AUSTRALIA: Australian blowhole deaths may be double suicide.</title>
<headline>Australian blowhole deaths may be double suicide.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-04-11</dateline>

<p>Two young women who died after falling down the same cliff-face blowhole where seven of their family members died five years ago may have committed a bizarre double suicide, according to a family friend.</p>
<p>"The two girls were disturbed by what they had gone through before," a family friend told reporters on Friday. "No one knows if they committed suicide or drowned."</p>
<p>The cousins were found floating in the ocean on Thursday after falling down the blowhole south of Sydney and being sucked out into the Pacific Ocean. One was 16 and the other was to celebrate her 21st birthday on the day she died.</p>
<p>Seven people died in 1992 when two families were sucked into the ocean by a freak wave surging through the same blowhole at Kiama, a fishing village 120 km (80 miles) south of Sydney.</p>
<p>Police confirmed that the 16-year-old girl's mother died in the 1992 tragedy, but declined to comment on speculation that the two may have committed suicide.</p>
<p>"That's a matter for the coroner," a police spokeswoman told Reuters. "At this stage there are no witnesses to how they finished up in the water."</p>
<p>"They were seen leaving their school at 9 a.m. on Wednesday but that's the last sighting we have of them alive."</p>
<p>Police have declined to identify the girls at the request of their families, who are originally from Afghanistan. "The family have had a really quite horrific time and are grieving pretty heavily," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>More than 300,000 visitors each year flock to the Kiama blowhole, a weathered opening in the cliff face where ocean waves rush in and cause spectacular explosions of white water and volcano-like gushes.</p>
<p>Teenagers have been known to leap into the Kiama blowhole for a daring and terrifying swim to safety.</p>
<p>Australia on Friday launched an A$31 million (US$24 million) programme combatting youth suicide, which is estimated to claim 400 lives each year -- the highest rate in the Western world.</p>
