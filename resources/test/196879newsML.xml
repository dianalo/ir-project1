<p>The debate over restricting radio and TV ads for hard liquor heated up at the Federal Communications Commission Monday after two commissioners voiced doubts over the FCC's ability to regulate such ads.</p>
<p>"In the final analysis, this issue is not one on which the FCC possesses either the jurisdiction or the expertise to resolve," FCC Commissioner James Quello said in a statement.</p>
<p>"And it is because I want to see this issue responsibily and effectively settled that I would not support engaging the FCC's rule-making or hearing processes in what I fear would ultimately be an ineffective, and possibly counterproductive, effort to devise a regulatory solution."</p>
<p>Quello called on Congress to pass new laws governing broadcast liquor ads, saying elected lawmakers have the proper authority to regulate the ads.</p>
<p>On Friday, Commissioner Rachelle Chong said the FCC should not take the lead in the current controversy, saying the agency "must tread very lighly on this issue."</p>
<p>Both made their comments after FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called on TV stations to reject hard-liquor ads, raising the possibility the FCC otherwise could respond with new rules. But he conceded any FCC rule making would face tough sledding.</p>
<p>The debate surfaced after the distilled spirits industry earlier this month ended its decades-old voluntary ban on broadcast advertising. The ban has been in place since 1936 for radio and 1948 for TV.</p>
<p>Seagram Co. Ltd. in June began airing TV ads for its Royal Crown whiskey in selected local markets.</p>
<p>Noting that the Federal Trade Commission has primary responsibility over regulating advertising, Chong questioned whether duplicate regulation was needed.</p>
<p>And because there is no statute directing the FCC to act in this area, Chong argued that any FCC-devised ban of liquor ads would face a high hurdle in the courts.</p>
<p>Quello agreed. "The issues raised by hard liquor advertising constitute a very difficult legal and factual no-man's land -- one that only Congress can effectively cross," Quello said.</p>
