<p>A violent earthquake killed nearly 50 people in Pakistan's southwestern province of Baluchistan in the early hours of Friday, local officials said.</p>
<p>But the death toll could rise further as exact information about casualties had not yet been received from some stricken villages in difficult mountainous terrain, they said.</p>
<p>Government officials confirmed at least 48 people were killed and more than 100 injured. But the private Edhi ambulance centre in Quetta reported 65 deaths, a figure which could not be confirmed from government sources.</p>
<p>The earthquake woke sleeping residents of Quetta, the provincial capital, with a roar "like doomsday" at 2.10 a.m. (2110 GMT Thursday). Another big jolt followed 20 minutes later and milder tremors continued for two hours, witnesses said.</p>
<p>"I thought doomsday had arrived and the world was about to end," said Feroza Begum, a school-teacher in Quetta.</p>
<p>The highest casualties occurred in three villages near Harnai town, about 100 km (63 miles) east of Quetta, where at least 38 people were killed and about 100 injured, a senior provincial government official said.</p>
<p>The official APP news agency quoted provincial home department secretary Ashraf Nasir as saying more than 200 families had been badly affected while hundreds of houses, including mud structures, collapsed.</p>
<p>Three people were killed in Quetta and five in the town of Sibi, to the southeast, local officials said. One person died in the town of Bhag and one in Mithri village, also southeast of Quetta, officials said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ordered a massive relief effort for the quake victims.</p>
<p>President Farooq Leghari had planned to visit the quake-hit areas but his plane could not land at Quetta because of strong cross-winds and was diverted to his home town of Dera Ghazi Khan in adjoining Punjab province, the official APP news agency said.</p>
<p>Zarar Haider, Deputy Commissioner in Sibi, told Reuters by telephone that army troops had been sent to Harnai, difficult to reach by road, to help in rescue operations. "We are sending help by rail and by helicopter," he added.</p>
<p>A government seismic centre in the northwestern town of Peshawar measured the earthquake at 6.2 on the open-ended Richter scale. It placed the epicentre in the Koh-i-Suleman mountain range, north of Quetta, near the Afghan border.</p>
<p>The U.S. Geological Survey's National Earthquake Information Centre in Golden, Colorado, put it at 7.3 on the Richter scale.</p>
<p>It said the earthquake occurred at 2108 GMT and was centred 110 km (70 miles) east southeast of Quetta, or 395 miles (630 km) southwest of Islamabad. It was followed 22 minutes later by an aftershock measuring 6.3 on the Richter scale.</p>
<p>In Quetta, the quake drove terrified residents, hotel guests and even hospital patients outside to spend the rest of the night with quilts and blankets to ward off the freezing cold.</p>
<p>Banaras Khan, owner of a photography shop in Quetta, said he had felt as if the earth was whipped away from under his feet.</p>
<p>"There was an explosion and then there was light in the sky. I couldn't understand what was happening. I also heard firing when I woke up. Later I realised what had happened," he said.</p>
<p>Moslem clerics went to mosques and called the faithful to prayer, a traditional response to calamity. Men fired guns in the air to wake people up. Officials used loudspeakers to warn people not to stay indoors because of the risk of more tremors.</p>
<p>"The jolt was like rocking a baby from side to side. The leaves were rustling and the trees were shaking," said Jan Mari, a resident of Sibi. "There was noise everywhere like doomsday."</p>
<p>"Everyone was reciting prayers. People were dragging their children outside by their arms and legs," Mari said.</p>
<p>The earthquake knocked out Quetta's power supply, but it was restored about three hours later. Telephone services were not disrupted. There were no immediate reports of looting.</p>
<p>Government offices opened in the morning, but attendance was very thin. Schools were closed for a winter holiday.</p>
<p>Quetta was destroyed by an earthquake on May 31, 1935 that measured 7.5 on the Richter scale and killed 30,000 people.</p>
<p>Azizullah (one name), a 90-year-old survivor of the 1935 earthquake, said he had heard the same noises on Friday. "I thought I had survived that day, but might not survive today."</p>
<p>Kulsoom (one name), a patient at Quetta's Civil Hospital, said she had been asleep at the time. "I rushed outside, but a wall fell on me. I don't know what happened afterwards. When I came to my senses, I was lying injured in bed."</p>
