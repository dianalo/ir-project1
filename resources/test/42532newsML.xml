<p>German shares ended a lively bourse session higher on Tuesday as the dollar strengthened appreciably against the mark and the Dow Jones index on Wall Street closed 1.31 percent higher overnight.</p>
<p>At the end of bourse trade the DAX index stood at 2,570.95 points, up 22.22 or 0.87 percent.</p>
<p>Firmer Bunds also helped to support the market over the session and dealers said sentiment was more bullish than it had been for some time.</p>
<p>"The dollar especially is cheering people up and Wall Street is of course positive," said one Munich dealer.</p>
<p>There was also speculation that key German interest rates might be cut again.</p>
<p>This came after Bundesbank council member Ernest Welteke said on Monday rates could nudge lower if M3 money supply growth moves closer to or enters the four to seven percent target growth rate corridor.</p>
<p>Shares in electronic giant Siemens AG fell after news that U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had downgraded the share to buy from hold.</p>
<p>Siemens ended floor trade down 86 pfennigs at 77.60 marks.</p>
<p>Chemical shares were boosted by the higher dollar. BASF AG ended up 66 pfennigs at 45.20 marks, Bayer AG was up 91 pfennigs at 53.93 marks and Hoechst AG was up 1.23 marks at 53.</p>
<p>Tyremaker Continental AG was up 80 pfennigs at 25.75 marks after news it settled a patent row with Goodyear.</p>
<p>Shares in plant manufacturer Duerr AG ended up 1.35 marks at 52.75 marks after it announced a 400 million mark order from Audi AG.</p>
