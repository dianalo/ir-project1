<p>American Homestar Corp said Wednesday it agreed to acquire privately owned retailer N.C. Mobile Home Corp for about $4.5 million in stock and cash.</p>
<p>The company said the deal is scheduled to close on June 1, and includes payment of $2.0 million in American Homestar's common stock and $2.5 million in cash and notes. The transaction will be accounted for as a purchase and is expected to be nominally accretive to fiscal 1998 earnings.</p>
<p>"When added to our existing retail franchise system and the non-affiliated independent dealers we serve, these new company retail centers will afford us a broader and more solid distribution base from which we can continue to implement our vertical integration growth strategy in this important market region," said co-chief executives Finis Teeter and Laurence Dawson.</p>
<p>American Homestar currently operates eight manufacturing plants, 52 company-owned retail centers, and serves more than 300 independent retail locations in 24 states.</p>
<p>The company recently announced the planned acquisition of Brilliant Homes in Alabama which, when completed in June 1997, will add three new manufacturing plants to the Company's network.</p>
