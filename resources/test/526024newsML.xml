<p>U.N. refugee chief Sadako Ogata said her agency again suspended relief work for Rwandan refugees in east Zaire on Monday following a rebel military operation and accused the Tutsi-dominated fighters of blocking relief work.</p>
<p>Ogata said her staff had been prevented from going into camps south of the rebel-held eastern city of Kisangani. She told Reuters a rebel military operation near Kasese camp on Monday raised the prospect of another refugee exodus.  </p>
<p>Ogata said the rebels launched their operation on Monday, claiming four local villagers were killed by former Rwandan Hutu government army soldiers among the refugees.</p>
<p>"There was gunfire heard, raising the possibility of refugee movements," she said. The UNHCR did not know the scale of the operation and had no confirmed reports of refugees fleeing yet.</p>
<p>UNHCR's plan to send the refugees home has been delayed repeatedly amid mounting rebel formalities, including demands for further medical checks on reported cases of cholera among the refugees.</p>
<p>"The operation has been blocked so much -- for clearance, then local animosity, cholera...," Ogata said. "I feel there is a blockage. They (the rebels) have not been very helpful. It's been very frustrating, very difficult."</p>
