<p>European grain traders on Tuesday threw doubt on Russia's ability to secure its grain import needs in 1997, but did not rule small purchases.</p>
<p>Exporters said they doubted cash-strapped Russia could finance a major import programme.</p>
<p>"They need to import grain but where are they going to find the cash," one exporter said.</p>
<p>Russian agriculture Minister Viktor Khlystun said earlier that Russia would import 4-5 million tonnes of grain in 1997, including 2.5 to three million tonnes of high quality wheat.</p>
<p>Traders said they had learned to be cautious when dealing with Russia.</p>
<p>Large grain purchases failed to materialise last season after Russia made similar announcements, they said.</p>
<p>"One can think it is just one more non-binding Russian announcement," another exporter said.</p>
<p>Traders explained that what made large-scale imports unlikely was the fact that the private sector and not the state would continue to do the buying.</p>
<p>Khlystun, reiterating Moscow's policy of the past three years, told a news conference the state would do no buying and any imports would be channelled through private firms.</p>
<p>Exporters said they doubted Russia -- whose harvest made a disappointing recovery in 1996 from last year's crop, the worst in a generation -- could generate enough cash from grain exports to help finance imports in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>Khlystun said Russia would export 6-7 million tonnes of grain from its 1996 harvest.</p>
<p>Khlystun put Russia's 1996 net grain output at 68.4 million tonnes, below government expectations of around 70 million and compared with last year's 63.4 million.</p>
<p>"I will believe it when they actually do some buying," one exporter said, referring to the planned imports.</p>
<p>But traders said they could not rule out small purchases by private operators.</p>
<p>They said Russian importers had already secured good-quality wheat from Argentina and Germany in recent months.</p>
<p>And Russian importers were seen likely to continue buying cheaper supplies in small quantities from Kazakhstan and Argentina.</p>
<p>Canadian, Australian and even European wheat stood a chance against high-priced U.S. wheat, traders said.</p>
<p>Russia was reported to have a harvest with relatively little high-quality wheat and needed to import wheat with a protein content of some 13.5-14 percent.</p>
<p>This would limit imports of wheat from the European Union which had an average protein content of 11 percent this year.</p>
<p>Record yields in parts of Europe produced a bumper crop but at the expense of protein levels needed for bread-making, especially in parts of France.</p>
