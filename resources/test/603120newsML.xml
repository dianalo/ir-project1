<p>British dry cleaning firm Sketchley Plc said on Wednesday it had found accounting problems at its retail unit that were expected to result in a "moderate" loss for the group in the year ended on March 31.  </p>
<p>The company said it would need to make additional provisions against the value of stock due to accounting "deficiencies" at its retail division.</p>
<p>"As a result, a loss will be suffered by the retail division in the second half of the group's financial year which will be in excess of the profit generated by that division in the first half," Sketchley said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company also planned a further charge for the previously-announced reorganisation of the division.</p>
<p>Sketchley said it would make immediate changes to its accounting and finance functions.</p>
<p>The company's shares sank more than 30 percent, dropping 28p to 60p by 0740 GMT to rank among the top percentage losers on the London stock market.</p>
<p>It said its other divisions, Textile Services and ARM, traded well and produced a positive result in line with its expectations.</p>
<p>Sketchley planned to announce its year results soon. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717</p>
