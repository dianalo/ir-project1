<p>South African cement firm Pretoria Portland Cement Ltd said on Thursday that its half year earnings per share were likely to be "slightly down" due to a higher effective tax rate and more shares in issue.  </p>
<p>"Earnings per share at the half year are expected to be slightly down on last year due to a higher effective tax rate and an increase in the number of shares in issue," chairman Warren Clewlow said in a trading statement.</p>
<p>For the six months to March 31, 1996, the firm posted an earnings per share of 226.6 cents.</p>
<p>At 1100 GMT PPC shares were down 100 cents to 68.00 rand.</p>
<p>But the group added first quarter sales volumes and operating profits are in line with company expectations and that the full year outlook was still good.</p>
<p>"We expect a satisfactory growth in earnings," Clewlow said. -- Johannesburg newsroom +27 11 482 1003</p>
