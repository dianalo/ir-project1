<p>September notionnel futures traded on MATIF are under pressure on Monday, but reasonable support at 129.52 should hold any correction, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>"This market's got a pretty negative tone -- it didn't look very good last week and I wouldn't be surprised to see it coming under pressure," said Marc Ostwald, technical analyst at London Bond Broking here.</p>
<p>"There's reasonable congestion support at 129.52,58 and I don't think it'll get much further than that."</p>
<p>By 0745 GMT, September notionnel were down 0.28 at 129.92, bumping right up against Ostwald's initial support at 129.92,94.  </p>
<p>Analysts at MCM YieldWatch in London said Friday's weakness meant the market would probe support at 129.80, the July 15 low.</p>
<p>"A sustained break down there indicates 131.30 as a medium term top for losses towards 129.02 and lower," they said in a note for clients.</p>
<p>They said if the market managed to claw its way over initial resistance at 130.04, it would put the current weakness on hold leaving 130.22 the target.</p>
<p>Ostwald said 130.34 would act as a fairly strong barrier for the contract, followed by 130.60,64, a series of old highs and lows.  </p>
<p>"I'd be very surprised if we got beyond that -- it's not looking good," said Ostwald. "There's the potential for a corrective bounce but no more than that."</p>
<p>By 0910 GMT, September Pibor futures were down three basis points at 96.44.</p>
