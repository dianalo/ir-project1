<p>Czech engineering concern Skoda a.s. said on Thursday it was planning to establish a joint venture with Russia's monopoly gas exporter Gazprom and the Russian firm Lyulka Saturn for production of gas-fuelled turbines.</p>
<p>Skoda said in a statement the joint venture, in which Skoda will hold 51 percent and the Russian partners 24.5 percent each, should be based at Skoda's facilities in the western Czech city of Plzen, beginning operations later this year.</p>
<p>"The extension of the range to gas turbines is supposed to enable us to become a world supplier of energy (generating) installations with combustion engines, and also the so-called steam-gas cycles," the statement said.</p>
<p>It said the 16 megawatt gas turbines, which have been already developed at Skoda, would be exported to Russia, China, Pakistan, Indonesia, Malaysia and other destinations beginning in 1998.</p>
<p>Skoda's spokesman Karel Samec said Gazprom already showed an interest in 450 of the turbines over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>"Other comapnies make 21 to 25 megawatt turbines, but Gazprom needs the 16-MW ones for its gas pumping stations," Samec said.</p>
<p>He said other countries have shown preliminary interest.</p>
<p>Lyulka Saturn also makes engines for Russian-made Sukhoi combat aircraft.</p>
<p>Skoda is an engineering concern no longer affiliated with car maker Skoda Automobilova a.s., a unit of Germany's Volkswagen AG.</p>
