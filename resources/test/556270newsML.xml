<p>USX-Delhi Group said it has agreed to acquire the Cabeza Creek Gathering System from Koch Gateway Pipeline Co for undisclosed terms.</p>
<p>The agreement is subject to a finding by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that Koch may abandon such facilities by sale to Delhi. The facilities will be integrated into Delhi's intrastate operations.</p>
<p>The Cabeza Creek System consists of 150 miles of pipelines and 2,600 horsepower of compression. Delhi plans to integrate these facilities with its existing gathering facilities in Karnes, Dewitt and Goliad counties in South Texas.</p>
<p>Processable, rich gas from this system will be transported to Delhi's existing Pettus Gas Processing Plant in Bee County, Texas. The Cabeza Creek System will complement Delhi's low-pressure gathering services in the Texas Gulf Coast area.</p>
