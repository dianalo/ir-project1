<p>ARCO Pipeline Co sees no prorationing in May for its California crude "Line 63," which runs south from oil fields in southern Central Valley to its refinery at Carson in the Los Angeles area, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>"In May there will be no proration factor," said Arco Pipeline spokesman John Thom.</p>
<p>Thom said ARCO does not disclose the volume of nominations on the 118-mile line, which is rated to carry 120,000 barrels per day (bpd) of light crude, but more typically carries from 105,000-110,000 bpd of a mix of light and heavy crudes.</p>
<p>ARCO Pipeline is a unit of Atlantic Richfield Co, and Line 63 is wholly-owned by ARCO.</p>
