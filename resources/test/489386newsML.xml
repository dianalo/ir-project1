<p>Americans consume more than $6 billion in imported fruit and vegetables every year and, if proponents have their way, all of that produce would carry a label saying where it was grown.</p>
<p>Advocates of country-of-origin labels have long argued that U.S. consumers have the right to know where their food comes from.</p>
<p>The debate, which has previously attracted little notice, was enlivened this week after the discovery on Wednesday that frozen strawberries tainted with the hepatitis A virus had been widely distributed, largely to school districts.</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Agriculture officials say the contaminated fruit may have come from Mexico. However, Mexico says there is no clear link to exports of the fruit from Mexico.</p>
<p>Two U.S. House members, Florida Democrat Karen Thurman and California Republican Sonny Bono, were expected to file a bill next week to require grocers to identify the source of fresh fruit and vegetables.</p>
<p>It is common for clothes and shoes to carry a tag saying where the item was made but not so for fresh produce, said Thurman aide Steven Cohen, in an interview with Reuters on Friday. "We think that's a pretty significant gap that needs closing," he said.</p>
<p>Three dozen lawmakers have joined a coalition of U.S. growers, processors and farm groups in pressing the Customs Service to proceed with a regulation to require that the front panel of packages of frozen produce list the country that grew the item.</p>
<p>The proposed rule has languished for months at the agency but officials said on Thursday that a decision was expected in the next month or two.</p>
<p>Packages of frozen produce already are required to carry a country-of-origin stamp but the coalition, American Alliance for Honest Labeling, says the rule is often ignored or there is minimal compliance in the form of tiny lettering in easily smudged ink.</p>
<p>"With the huge increase in produce coming across the border under the NAFTA (North American Free Trade Agreement) trade deal, it's more important than ever that packages are clearly marked," said Joe Fahey, head of a Teamsters Union local 912 in California, in a statement released on Thursday.</p>
<p>Sarah Delea of the United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, a U.S. trade group, said imported foods were required to meet the same standards as U.S. produce.</p>
<p>"Just because produce is grown outside the United States doesn't mean it's inherently unsafe," Delea said in an interview with Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>Mexico, Chile, Canada and the banana-growing nations of Costa Rica, Colombia, Ecuador, Honduras and Guatemala were the major sources of U.S. fruit and vegetable imports in dollar terms.</p>
<p>In the year ending Sept. 30, 1996, the United States imported $1.68 billion in fresh vegetables, $1.16 billion in fresh fruit, $1.8 billion in processed fruits and vegetables, $1.15 billion in bananas and plantains, and $830 million in juices, according to U.S. trade data.</p>
