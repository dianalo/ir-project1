<p>Britain's opposition Labour Party on Sunday staked its future on a commitment not to raise income tax rates as the credentials of the revamped party, out of power for 18 years, emerged as a key issue for the May 1 national election.</p>
<p>At the end of the first frenetic week of campaigning, Labour leader Tony Blair acknowledged that his party would be finished if it broke the pledges it has made since ditching much of its old socialist dogma.</p>
<p>"If I break my promises on tax, on not raising basic and top rate tax, on trade unions and these essential things that I have said we will do, we are gone. We are probably finished forever," Blair said in an interview for the News of the World.</p>
<p>But Conservative Prime Minister John Major, battling a mood for change among Britons and a 25 point deficit in opinion polls, attacked the "fancy face" of new Labour.</p>
<p>"They are presenting, in my judgement, a completely false face to the public," Major said in separate interview for the News of the World.</p>
<p>Claiming that taxes, spending, interest and mortgage rates would rise if Labour took power, Major said; "The fancy face of Labour is not the reality of Labour, and would not be the reality of Labour in government."</p>
<p>Labour is desperate to bury the image of a high tax and spend party dominated by the trade unions that has dogged its efforts to win the last four elections.</p>
<p>Blair, 43, who is bidding to become the youngest prime minister this century, has moved his party so far from the left since becoming leader in 1994 that political analysts now find it difficult to tell the difference between Labour and Conservative policies.</p>
<p>Labour has ditched historic commitments over the public ownership of major industries and has pledged not to raise income tax rates for the first five years after winning power.</p>
<p>Blair on Sunday insisted that Labour had completely changed its once close working relationship with the trade unions.</p>
<p>"My view of trade unions is very simple. They are a good part of a healthy democracy but they must never be confused with the government of the day," he said.</p>
<p>The first week of campaigning was wrecked for Major because of persistent allegations of sleaze surrounding several Conservative members of parliament.</p>
<p>The Conservatives are seeking to turn the argument away from a cash for questions scandal, claiming that a vote for inexperienced Labour is a leap in the dark. They are also playing on suspicions among many Britons that Labour cannot be trusted, particularly with the economy.</p>
<p>"The underlying message, quite simple, is that Britain's booming. Don't let Labour blow it," Major said.</p>
<p>"If people think it's safe to vote Labour then I believe they'd be in for a very nasty shock," he said.</p>
