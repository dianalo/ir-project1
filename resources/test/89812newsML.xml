<p>South Korea's Daewoo Motor Co, a unit of the Daewoo Group, said on Tuesday long-running talks with British sportscar maker and auto engineer Lotus Group had broken down as the two parties failed to narrow differences.</p>
<p>"Talks have been suspended between Daewoo and Lotus due to differences over terms and conditions of a deal to buy the British carmaker," Daewoo Motor spokesman Lee Chang-won said.</p>
<p>"But we are still interested in Lotus," said Lee, indicating the talks could resume if a compromise could be found.</p>
<p>He declined to give further details.  </p>
<p>Kim Woo-choong, founder and chairman of the Daewoo Group, earlier said Daewoo had been in discussions about a possible acquisition of Lotus.</p>
<p>Lee denied a report by Britain's Financial Times that Daewoo was ready to buy the British firm. The paper said that under the terms of the deal, which could be signed by the end of the week, Daewoo was expected to pay in the region of $75 million to Romano Artioli, the chairman and owner of the group.</p>
<p>Artioli in mid-September promised to announce a new partner for Lotus "within days".  </p>
<p>"We have heard many British reports similar to this. But we cannot confirm anything at this moment as nothing has yet been decided," Lee added.</p>
<p>A spokesman of the Lotus Group earlier said the partner's identity could not yet be revealed and he declined to comment on news reports it was South Korea's Daewoo Motor Co.</p>
<p>But Daewoo Motor has been the most frequently named potential partner in the trade press, closely followed by a British engineering consortium led by former racing driver Brian Henton.</p>
