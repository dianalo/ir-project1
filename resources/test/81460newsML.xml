<p>The United States urged the Security Council on Friday to encourage Israel and the Palestinians to revive the Middle East peace process and not to condemn Israel.</p>
<p>The call, by U.S. envoy Madeleine Albright, contrasted with the remarks of virtually all other speakers, who criticised Israel in varying terms for opening an archaeological tunnel in the Old City of Jerusalem and accused it of delaying moves toward peace.</p>
<p>"Let us turn our attention not toward condemnation but toward encouraging the parties to restore the peace process and return to efforts to achieve concrete progress," Albright told the council.</p>
<p>She had opposed holding the debate, sparked by violence that has claimed the lives of more than 50 Palestinians and over a dozen Israelis since Israel recently opened a new entrance to an undeground passage near the al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third-holiest shrine.</p>
<p>Albright, whose country is the main sponsor of the peace process, said the first objective was to restore calm, then to accelerate the negotiating process, adding: "Both sides must reach out to each other as real partners. Partners take into account the needs of others."</p>
<p>"Words here are no substitute for action in the region," she said, alluding to U.S. efforts to prod Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat to meet and restore the peace momentum.</p>
<p>Innocent Palestinians and Israelis alike had suffered senseless violence, Albright said. "Rhetoric offers them no comfort. It does not advance the cause of peace," she said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Farouk Kaddoumi, who heads the Palestine Liberation Organisation's political department, said the violence resulted from "an accumulation of simmering tensions" for which Israel bore full responsibility.</p>
<p>He cited a long list of actions by Israel's new right-wing government, including the resumption of settlement activities, a failure to withdraw from the West Bank town of Hebron and the sealing of the occupied territories, and he called for the dispatch of a U.N. mission to investigate the situation.</p>
<p>Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy rejected what he called the "orchestrated attempt to place blame on Israel and to portray her as the sole responsible party for the bitter harvest of blood" in which Palestinians and Israelis had died.</p>
<p>"I come to refute in their entirety the distortions of fact which are being spread here regarding the dramatic events of the last days and which have cast such a dark cloud over the entire peace process."</p>
<p>"Israel is not on trial," he said. The tunnel was being used as a pretext to exert political pressure on Israel and to predetermine the outcome of negotiations, he said.</p>
<p>More than 40 speakers were taking part in the daylong debate, but by late afternoon no resolution had been formally tabled.</p>
<p>One Arab draft serving as a basis for negotiation would condemn Israel's actions, demand the closing of the tunnel and call for the immediate resumption of the Middle East peace process and the implementation of agreements already reached.</p>
<p>The United States, as a permanent council member with a veto, can block any resolution or statement which it regards as unacceptable.</p>
