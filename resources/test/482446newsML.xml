<p>Danish pay deals, averaging 3.5 to 4.0 percent for 1997 and 1998, are much as expected but at a level that keeps open the risk of inflation and underlines the need for fiscal discipline, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Public and private sector collective wage negotiations have produced national agreements for average annual wage rises in the 3.5-4.0 percent range, with supplementary increases still to be agreed at local level.</p>
<p>Den Danske Bank chief economist Joergen Birger Christensen said that the government was failing to keep to its own goal of 1996 and 1997 fiscal tightening of 0.5 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>"It is worrying, because we are in what appears to be a pretty solid economic upturn that is still too dependent on the domestic market. Something is wrong if one cannot keep to a tight fiscal policy that one has declared in advance," he said.</p>
<p>"It is important that the government conducts a tight fiscal policy. It has, unfortunately not been especially good at that if you look at the 1996 figures," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Personal spending rose 2.8 percent in 1996 and net domestic orders grew 2.2 percent, the central bank said last month.</p>
<p>Data released by the National Statistics Office on Wednesday showed 1996 GDP growth of 2.4 percent (Corrects from 2.6 percent), compared to an average forecast of 2.3 percent and fourth quarter growth of 3.3 percent year-on-year, against an expected 3.1 percent.</p>
<p>Unibank Markets Chief Analyst Klaus Dalsgaard agreed on the need to curb domestic consumption but said the latest pay deals were not calamitous.</p>
<p>"There is still a risk of wages accelerating unless a lid is put on the domestic economy. But the wage deals are far from being a disaster when you take into consideration Denmark's advanced position in the economic cycle," he said.</p>
<p>Both analysts said central wage rounds played a less important role in Denmark than before, with negotiations on supplementary pay deals at local level posing a serious risk of accelerating the pay spiral.</p>
<p>Last month the central bank urged that price and wage rises, though moderate at present, be kept under close control and called for a tight fiscal stance in 1998.</p>
<p>The ruling Social Democratic Party itself said on Wednesday that the latest wage round made Danish workers more costly than their main European competitors.</p>
<p>"Pay rises for this year and next in Denmark look like being higher than in key EMU (economic and monetary union) candidate nations led by Germany, where pay hikes of just below three percent are foreseen," the party's news service said.</p>
