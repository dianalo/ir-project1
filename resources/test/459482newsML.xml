<p>Price differentials for U.S. domestic cash crude grades steadied in late Friday activity, with most of the market focused on finishing April business.</p>
<p>Outright crude prices declined around 35 cents in the May NYMEX futures contract, down to around $21.50 a barrel. Traders said the late call on the April/May West Texas Intermediate roll put the spread at +15/20 cts, equating benchmark April WTI/Cushing at $21.65-70 a barrel.</p>
<p>The roll will be in play for the next few sessions, as traders evalute their physical positions ahead of April pipeline scheduling deadlines on Tuesday.</p>
