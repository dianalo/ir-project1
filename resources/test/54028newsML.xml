<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin will stay in Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital for the weekend to allow doctors to carry out more tests ahead of forthcoming heart surgery, a Kremlin spokesman said.</p>
<p>He told Reuters there was nothing unusually wrong with the 65-year-old president, who returned from his holiday home near the capital on Thursday to begin a series of check-ups. It was simply easier for the doctors to work in the hospital, he said.  </p>
<p>"This is not a situation created by an unforeseen event," the spokesman said. "There is no question of this being an emergency hospitalisation.</p>
<p>"It is the continuation of the planned checks since a number of tests and examinations can be effectively conducted only as an in-patient."</p>
<p>The spokesman did not say precisely when Yeltsin planned to leave. The president broke a long tradition of Kremlin silence on his health by announcing earlier this month that he would have heart surgery, probably at the end of September in Moscow.</p>
<p>His doctors said on Thursday after checks that they would meet again around September 28 to set the date of the operation, which they say will be a bypass to improve blood supply to the heart. Several foreign specialists are also being consulted.</p>
