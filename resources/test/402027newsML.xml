<p>Christie's auction house on Tuesday unveiled the 80 ballgowns and cocktail dresses being sold for charity by Princess Diana in what they called a "once in a lifetime event".</p>
<p>The 80 glittering designer gowns, including a blue velvet dress in which Diana danced at the White House with film star John Travolta, are to be auctioned in New York on June 25.</p>
<p>Media estimates have said the sale could realise over one million pounds ($1.64 million) for AIDS and cancer charities but Christie's said it was impossible to put a price on the gowns.</p>
<p>"It is unquantifiable. These sorts of sales are unique... You just can't estimate how much money people will be prepared to pay. These dresses have a sort of magic about them," said Meredith Etherington-Smith, Christie's marketing director.</p>
<p>"Members of the royal family have given dresses to their friends...but they have never actually sold them before. So this is a once in a lifetime occasion," she told a news conference.</p>
<p>The dresses include creations by British designers Catherine Walker, Zandra Rhodes, Bruce Oldfield and Victor Edelstein and were worn by Diana between 1981 and 1996.</p>
<p>Most were worn on state occasions in Britain, the United States, France, India, Korea, Thailand and other countries, but some have never been seen in public before. They will go on view in London and New York immediately before the sale.</p>
<p>Christie's said Diana herself chose the dresses, which cover her royal life during and after her unhappy marriage to Britain's future king Prince Charles. But the ivory silk wedding dress she wore for the 1981 fairytale wedding is not included.</p>
<p>"The bridal dress remains in the princess's own collection and there, as far as anyone of us are aware, it will remain," said Etherington-Smith.</p>
<p>Princess Diana, who was divorced from Charles last August, told Christie's that the idea for the sale came from her teenage son Prince William.</p>
<p>"I imagine the idea came to him from seeing all these beautiful dresses -- I think it's rather sweet and touching," said Christopher Balfour, chairman of Christie's Europe.</p>
<p>Diana said in a statement that she was extremely happy to be raising money for two of her favourite charities.</p>
<p>"It goes without saying that these dresses which gave me so much pleasure may be enjoyed by others," her statement added.</p>
<p>On Monday Diana started legal proceedings for libel against a British newspaper that had suggested she would benefit financially from the auction.</p>
<p>Christie's said they expected buyers to include admirers of Diana around the world as well as museums.</p>
<p>But Etherington-Smith made light of suggestions that the shimmering lace, silk and chiffon creations could end up being worn by cabaret artistes or transvestites.</p>
<p>"I think the princess might say if she was asked that question -- as long as they enjoy them'. She enjoyed them and now other people can enjoy them," said Etherington-Smith.</p>
<p>Royal commentators shrugged off suggestions that the auction signalled attempts by Diana to leave behind her unhappy royal past and adopt a lower-profile image.</p>
<p>"I don't think it is any particular conscious shedding of image," said Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine. "You can imagine how much room they take up. I would think she just thought what shall i do with them all?" ($1=.6107 Pound)</p>
