<p>The collapse of plans to breathe new life into Thailand's biggest finance firm by merging it with a bank has intensified pressure on the authorities to come up with new solutions to a sector-wide debt and cash crisis.</p>
<p>Analysts said on Tuesday that, after a string of much-vaunted rescues, the government has precious few options left -- and even fewer that will be easy to swallow.</p>
<p>They said the failed link-up between Finance One and Thai Danu Bank, which had been billed as a trailblazer for the rest of the sector, showed that mergers are not a ready solution.</p>
<p>They said it was high time for the authorities to relax the rules on foreign ownership of financial institutions and reward white knights with much sought-after banking licences.</p>
<p>But there is no telling who would be prepared to ride to the rescue of the finance firms, whose one-time glory has been wiped out by a four-year slump on the property market.</p>
<p>The country's 15 local banks and 91 finance companies have extended a massive 800 billion baht ($31 billion) in loans to property developers, and analysts reckon that at least 20 percent of finance company loans are non-performing.</p>
<p>Analysts said it will be hard to find suitors for a marriage beset with problems unless those suitors get some guarantee of support, realistically priced assets or sweeteners such as a banking licence -- or all three.</p>
<p>"I don't think mergers are going to work," said Ian McLellan, Head of Thai Research at SBC Warburg.</p>
<p>He said it was high time the central bank put its foot down, taking over the equity of firms which it has been propping up.</p>
<p>"With the companies that can't help themselves, the ones that are dependent on the Bank of Thailand, essentially they are being funded by the taxpayer," he said. "It seems to me that the taxpayers own these companies, officially they are bankrupt."</p>
<p>McLellan said that perhaps 40 to 50 such firms -- just how many may become clear when more stringent rules on financial reporting come in after June 30 -- should have their equity parcelled out to external managers for eventual sale.</p>
<p>The same approach was mooted by Wirot Poonsuwan, a financial lawyer writing in the daily The Nation.</p>
<p>"There is no way out other than with help from the authorities, and again the taxpayers," he said. "A temporary takeover by the authorities is the answer, even though this may cause a reduction in the country's reserves."</p>
<p>He said the next step should be a takeover by foreign firms, but at realistic prices and with some incentives thrown in.</p>
<p>Supavat Saicheua, Vice President of the finance and securities firm Krungthai Thanakit Public, was not so sure that brutally winding-up companies was the immediate answer.</p>
<p>"The Bank of Thailand will have to continue with incentives for most of the finance companies to merge or at least become stronger, for example by giving them freedom to deal in foreign exchange and deposit accounts...just like a bank," he said.</p>
<p>However, he agreed that if the companies' health does not pick up, the central bank would have to step in by forcing mergers and winding up the worst performers.</p>
<p>At this stage, there is no sign that such a fate awaits Finance One, despite its derailed merger and despite a report that the Bank of Thailand has ordered a probe to determine if the company's management had committed fraud.</p>
<p>Instead, the company's shares will be traded on the stock exchange again on Friday after a three-month suspension.</p>
<p>Analysts were not surprised that Finance One stock has dropped to around three or four baht on the unofficial grey market from 23.75 when trade was halted on February 28.</p>
<p>"It's a bit like the Bank of England allowing Barings to trade after it's gone bust," said one.</p>
