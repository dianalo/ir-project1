<p>A new daily production record of 49.9 million cubic metres was set by the Troll gas treatment plant at Kollsnes outside Bergen on February 17-18, operator Den norske stats oljeselskal AS said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Statoil said that since the North Sea Ekofisk oilfield had experienced production problems this year, the company had been permitted to deliver more gas than before.</p>
<p>It said a number of bottlenecks in the pipelines also had been eliminated to raise delivery capacity to 50 million cubic metres.</p>
<p>Average daily deliveries from Kollsnes were around 43 to 44 million cubic metres.</p>
