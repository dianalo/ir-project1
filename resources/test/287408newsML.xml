<p>All Russia's Interior Ministry troops have left the rebel region of Chechnya, but some Defence Ministry units remain, officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Lieutenant-General Pavel Maslov, chief of staff of the Interior Ministry troops, told RIA news agency the withdrawal, ordered by President Boris Yeltsin, had gone ahead "strictly according to plan" and "without incident".</p>
<p>He did not say when the pullout had been completed in the RIA report, which was confirmed by the ministry.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Defence Ministry said by telephone some army units were still in Chechnya and could not say exactly when they would leave.</p>
<p>In November, Yeltsin ordered all Russian troops, both from the defence and interior ministries, to leave Chechnya to clear the way for general elections there scheduled for January 27.</p>
<p>There have been conflicting reports over the deadline for the withdrawal but an interior ministry spokesman said Maslov, was directly in charge of operations and had up-to-the-minute information.</p>
<p>Maslov told RIA the confusion had been intentional and dictated by the need "to avoid possible provocations". He added that all the troops' equipment had also been withdrawn.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people, mostly civilians, were killed in 21 months of fighting following Yeltsin's decision in December 1994 to use military force to quell Chechnya's independence drive.</p>
<p>But the military failed to establish control over the mountainous territory and Yeltsin opted for peace talks early this year which helped him win a second term in the Kremlin in a July election.</p>
