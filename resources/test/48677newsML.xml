<p>Fabio Baldato captured the sixth stage of the Tour of Spain and the leader's yellow jersey on Thursday, timing his move superbly to emerge from the pack in a sprint finish.</p>
<p>The Italian started the day three seconds behind previous race leader Laurent Jalabert, but whittled the gap down to just one second after picking up bonus time in special sprint stages.</p>
<p>Russian rider Dimitry Konyshev made an early break for home at the end of the stage, only to see Baldato steal victory -- and a 12-second bonus -- at the finish line.</p>
<p>"This is the reward for the team's hard work. Everything that comes next will be a plus," said Baldato, who now has an 11-second lead over Jalabert and stands 22 seconds ahead of Giovanni Lombardi in provisional overall standings.</p>
<p>The riders escaped the rain that caused problems earlier in the week, but were buffeted by wind all the way along the 210 km coast road from Almeria to Malaga.</p>
<p>Despite the conditions Italy's Marco di Renzo broke clear towards the 35-kilometre mark, and was joined shortly afterwards by Francisco Cabello, who was riding through his home province of Granada for much of the day.</p>
<p>The pair surged to an 18-minute lead before Jalabert's ONCE team closed the gap. Until the final 25 kms it looked as if di Renzo and Cabello might even hang on, but Cabello was caught 12 kilometres out and di Renzo at the 10-kilometre mark as the Mapei team pushed for their second successive stage victory.</p>
<p>The Vuelta continues on Friday with the 150km seaside stage along the Costa del Sol to the resort town of Marbella.</p>
