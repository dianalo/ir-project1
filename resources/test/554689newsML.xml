<p>A sharp fall in cocoa futures this week has failed to attract industry buying on a large scale and with holidays across much of Europe on Thursday, the cash market remained dormant, traders said.</p>
<p>"Industry buyers are not interested in extending their cover and experience tells us they don't buy the dips anyway," said one trader based in continental Europe. Many of Europe's market players were also travelling to London ahead of Friday's annual cocoa trade dinner.</p>
<p>Cocoa futures tumbled on Tuesday, rocked by a speculator-led sell-off that has taken the benchmark July position down to around 990 stg from 1,030 stg last week.</p>
<p>Ghana as well as Ivory Coast were reported to have been in the cash market over the last week, selling small amounts of cocoa nearby and for October/December shipment.</p>
<p>Ghana was quoted a five stg below the terminal market and Ivorian beans around 25 stg under, although traders said it could be bought much cheaper.</p>
<p>"If you want to move anything in a large volume, than you have to be offering it at 35 stg under," one commented.</p>
<p>Some German buyers were reported to be placing orders for the third and fourth quarter but the attraction provided by the price fall was dented by the continued strength of sterling.</p>
<p>The futures market shake-out this week has come amid the growing belief in Europe the Ivory Coast's mid-crop will be larger than earlier anticipated.</p>
<p>There had been fears that not only would it be much smaller than last year's 200,000 tonnes but also the inferior quality of the beans would make much of it untenderable against the market.</p>
<p>But one trader said, "There have been no problems with the quality so far and you can see by the forecasts coming out, it's going to be good crop.</p>
<p>"The beans are in fact a little bit bigger than last year."</p>
<p>Broker GNI on Wednesday cut its world supply deficit for 1996/97 to 33,000 tonnes from 180,000 based on a sharp upward revision of global production to 2.72 million tonnes. It also pegged the Ivorian mid-crop at 160,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Market forecasts had been as low as 100,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>And on Thursday the International Cocoa Organisation (ICCO) estimated the world deficit in 1996/97 at 115,000 tonnes, down on last year's 160,000-tonne surplus.</p>
