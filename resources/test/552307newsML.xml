<p>Financial analysts on Wednesday described first quarter earnings of Philippine food and beer giant San Miguel Corp as disappointing, but hoped its performance would improve later in the year.</p>
<p>San Miguel also said sales volumes of Coca-Cola rose by more than 30 percent in April after retailers finally complied with the lower prices proposed by 70 percent-owned unit Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines Inc due to the stiff competition from other soft drink producers.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola Bottlers is being sold to Australian-based soft drink bottler Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd in exchange for a 25 percent stake in Amatil.</p>
<p>Improving food earnings and a rebound in beer and soft drinks sale from an expected increase in consumer spending should boost San Miguel's earnings, they said.</p>
<p>The company reported on Tuesday that its recurring net income rose 25 percent to 904 million pesos in the first three months compared with 725 million a year-earlier.</p>
<p>But operating income slumped 37 percent to 1.01 billion pesos after the conglomerate had to absorb the impact of higher excise taxes on beer sales before it increased prices.</p>
<p>Analysts said the 25 percent growth in net largely came from its property unit which turned in a net profit of 671 million pesos, up from 120 million.</p>
<p>"It's disappointing but there's hope. The food sector has already recovered. And sales of Coke rose by more than 30 percent in April," said Raul Ruiz, research director of Sun Hung Kai Securities.</p>
<p>Ruiz said he might lower his earlier prediction of 16 percent profit growth to 6.15 billion pesos. San Miguel made a recurring net of 5.26 billion pesos in 1996.</p>
<p>Conrad Andres, research head of DBP-Daiwa Securities, said the slow sales of beer had been expected in the first quarter.</p>
<p>"It was an adjustment period from the higher taxes. There will be a recovery. Consumer spending will be prolonged through the first half of 1998 in the light of the upcoming presidential elections," Andres said.</p>
<p>"We're a buy on San Miguel. We expect San Miguel to earn 6.33 billion pesos in 1997. There will be no downgrading," he added.</p>
<p>San Miguel reported that sales volumes of the food and packaging business increased by four and eight percent respectively, while the beverage sales dropped one percent.</p>
<p>Aside from ther impact of higher taxes, its profits from beer operations were cut by overseas investments in distribution and brand development efforts.</p>
<p>San Miguel's earnings have been dampened in recent years by high prices for raw materials and a glut in poultry supply.</p>
