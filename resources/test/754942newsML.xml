<p>Foster's Brewing Group Ltd said on Thursday it expected Philip Morris Cos Inc to sell its 20 percent stake in Canada's Molson Breweries to both Foster's and Molson Cos Ltd.</p>
<p>Foster's and Molson Cos have an option to buy the Philip Morris stake, held by subsidiary Millers Brewing, on a 50-50 basis.  </p>
<p>"I would expect that will eventually go through but it's not only up to us -- but my expectation is that we will see that," Foster's Chairman John Ralph told reporters.</p>
<p>"If that deal is finally consummated, Molson (Cos) would have the other 10 percent," he said.  </p>
<p>Molson said on June 18 that the buy-back talks were at a fairly advanced stage but would not reveal price details.</p>
<p>Molson and Foster's each own 40 percent of Molson Breweries.</p>
<p>Foster's and Molson Cos each sold 10 percent of Molson Breweries, Canada's largest brewer, to Miller in 1993 but the sale proved to be a major and costly headache for Molson Breweries and its shareholders.</p>
<p>The sale was found to breach the conditions of a licencing agreement with Miller's U.S. rival, Adolph Coors Co, with Moslon settling the dispute for C$100 million.</p>
