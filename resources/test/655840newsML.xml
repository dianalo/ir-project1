<p>Unionized workers at Inco Ltd's Sudbury, Ontario operations said on Thursday they were digging in for a long strike against the nickel giant as talks between the two sides remained stalled.</p>
<p>"(The workers) are doing extremely well. The weather is beautiful and they're enjoying their summer...we're preparing to settle in for the long haul," union spokesman Barry Tooley told Reuters in a telephone interview from Sudbury.</p>
<p>Talks between Inco and the United Steelworkers of America broke down when the union's 4,670 Sudbury workers rejected Inco's contract offer, which had been endorsed by union leaders, and walked off the job at midnight June 2.</p>
<p>Both sides said on Thursday it was up to the other to restart the talks by presenting a new offer or demands.</p>
<p>Inco on Tuesday sought the informal help of a provincial mediator to help resolve the impasse, but mediator Dennis Nelson found the two sides were too far apart to return to the table and withdrew.</p>
<p>Inco's Sudbury workforce last struck in 1978 for eight months.</p>
<p>The Sudbury operations were scheduled to be shut down for three weeks in July for routine maintence, but Inco spokesman David Allen said today the company was negotiating with the union to have some of that work done during the strike by outside contractors.</p>
<p>"We're expecting that that will proceed so that if the strike did end, say in two weeks, that we would have had the bulk of some of the maintenance work behind and work could resume that much more quickly," he said.</p>
<p>"I don't think anybody wants the prospect of settling the strike and then having a shutdown for three weeks or four weeks to do maintenance," Allen added.</p>
<p>Union spokesman Tooley said the blue-collar Sudbury community, which grew up alongside the hardrock mines that now produce about a twenty percent of the world's nickel supply annually, had rallied to support the striking workers.</p>
<p>He said the union had arranged for long-term support from area bankers and health care providers to ensure workers and their families were protected from immediate financial obligations beyond their strike pay.</p>
<p>"We're having a tremendous amount of support from the whole community. We're receiving all kinds of donations from area businesses, even hamburgers and hot dogs (for the picket lines)," Tooley said.</p>
<p>Before the strike, Inco's Ontario division was expected to produce about 230 million pounds of nickel, 200 million pounds of copper and about four million pounds of cobalt in 1997.</p>
