<p>European vegetable oils closed mixed in thin trading following near-term uncertainty over direction, traders said.</p>
<p>The palm oil sector retreated slightly from midday levels to finish up $5 to down $2.50, as traders felt that hopes of an increase in Chinese demand had been overplayed.</p>
<p>"I think that although the Chinese may enter the market soon, I'm sure they have ample stocks, which leaves me wondering just how much they would buy if they do enter the market," one trader said.</p>
<p>During the afternoon palm olein traded Apr/Jun at $572.50.</p>
<p>The only other trade during Thursday afternoon was for crude palm oil at $572.50 for Jan, and $550 for Feb/Mar on RBD palm oil, which sold earlier at $545.00.</p>
<p>Lauric oils remained steady buoyed by earlier palm oil firmness, closing $5 to $7.50 higher. Coconut oil business ranged from Dec/Jan at $780 through to Feb/Mar at $760.00.</p>
<p>Soft oils mostly closed from unchanged to 0.50 guilders firmer after a slightly firmer beginning to the Chicago soyoil futures.</p>
<p>Soy oil changed hands at 92.75 guilders for Feb/Apr, while rape oil fetched 95 guilders for the same position. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 8074</p>
