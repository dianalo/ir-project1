<p>John Hart will coach the All Blacks through  to their 1999 World Cup campaign, the New Zealand Rugby Football Union  (NZRFU) confirmed on Friday.</p>
<p>Hart has been reappointed as coach on a two-year contract which expires  on December 31, 1999.</p>
<p>"John is recognised as the best international coach and his long-term  appointment to the All Blacks is a key factor in keeping New Zealand  at the top of world rugby," NZRFU chief executive David Moffett said.</p>
<p>Hart has coached the All Blacks since the start of the 1996 season.  During his tenure the team was won 14 of 15 test matches, become the  inaugural Tri-Nations champions, and become the first All Black side  to win a test series on South African soil.</p>
<p>Hart said he had thoroughly enjoyed steering the All Blacks into the  new professional era and looked forward to the challenges ahead.</p>
<p>"The Rugby World Cup is the long distance goal, but it's much broader  than that. We also have the Tri-Nations Series to defend, the Bledisloe  Cup to retain, and the ongoing mission of proving ourselves against  the Northern Hemisphere countries," he said.</p>
<p>"It's an exciting time for rugby and I am proud to be part of it."</p>
