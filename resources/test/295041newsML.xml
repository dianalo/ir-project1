<p>Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission on Wedneday urged local investors publicly not to engage in "illegal" trading of Taiwan stock index futures being launched on Thursday in Singapore and Chicago.  </p>
<p>"We hope that investors will not conduct trade in illegal futures brokerages," Hsu Yung-pang, vice-chairman of the watchdog body, told reporters after a policy meeting between the commission and Finance Ministry.</p>
<p>"We will cooperate with the Investigation Bureau to investigate any illegal trading on the futures index," he said.</p>
<p>Hsu said that Taiwan had yet to legalise trading by local investors of the Taiwan stock index futures being launched on Thurday by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Singapore International Monetary Exchange, or SIMEX.  </p>
<p>Hsu said Taiwan law prohibited local futures brokerages from placing orders for Taiwan investors through overseas affiliates and promised that violators would face "harsh punishment".</p>
<p>He did not address the question of whether investors who placed overseas orders themselves by telephone or other "underground" methods would be considered lawbreakers.</p>
<p>Hsu said his agency would decide "as soon as possible" whether to legalise local access to the contracts.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Paul Chiu said Taiwan regarded the offshore index contracts as positive even though regulators have yet to allow Taiwan investors to trade them.</p>
