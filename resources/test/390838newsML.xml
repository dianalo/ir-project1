<p>Bulgaria's interim government decided on Thursday to issue a new 50,000-lev note by end-June, the government press centre said.</p>
<p>"The government approved today the design of a 50,000-lev note proposed by the central bank, which is to be put in circulation in the first half of this year," a statement said.</p>
<p>Soaring inflation made a new note necessary to ease large payments, the government said.</p>
<p>The largest denomination in use so far is a 10,000-lev note, which was put into circulation on December 9.</p>
<p>The lev has fallen from around 500 per dollar at the beginning of this year to around 2,050 on February 20 and traded at a record low of 3,200 on February 7 on the interbank forex market.</p>
<p>Official figures show monthly inflation for January 1 to 25 was 43.8 percent. Experts from the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences forecast it will near 100 percent in February.</p>
<p>The new note depicts the brothers Cyril and Methodius who created the Cyrilic alphabet in the 9th century. Initially the notes will be printed in Germany but printing will be transferred to Bulgaria in the second half of the year. -- Sofia Newsroom +359-2 981 8569</p>
