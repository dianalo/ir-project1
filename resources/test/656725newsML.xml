<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures were still narrowly mixed late Thursday in lackluster trade, with technical buying underpinning the complex despite reports of a softer cash, industry sources said.</p>
<p>At 1430 EDT, July eased 0.1 cent to $2.07 per million British thermal units, while August was 1.7 cents lower at $2.09. Others were trading on either side of unchanged.</p>
<p>"Short-term, we could get a pop on the oversold condition, but daily charts, strip charts, moving averages and stochs all look terrible," said one Texas trader, adding July's break of support Wednesday turned the picture much more bearish.  </p>
<p>Chart watchers said they expected a bounce after the five percent slide in three sessions, but most expected July's close yesterday below $2.08 to lead to a test of psychological support at $2, then possibly a break to the mid-$1.90s.</p>
<p>July resistance was seen at $2.155, $2.21, $2.25, $2.37 and the contract high of $2.44.</p>
<p>While cooler Midwest and Northeast weather was expected this weekend and early next week, revised forecasts call for above-normal temperatures across southern tier states by midweek next week, a factor that could offer some hope for the bulls. Northern states mostly are expected to stay seasonal.</p>
<p>In addition, traders said favorable spreads were still encouraging injections and should help prop the front of the board though few expected any significant move up without a broad, sustained heat wave.</p>
<p>In the cash Thursday, swing gas at the Louisiana Gulf was talked a couple of cents lower in the low-teens. Midcon pipes were down a few cents to the high-$1.90s-2.00. New York city gate gas lost similar ground to the high-$2.30s-2.40.</p>
<p>Separately, Mobil Corp said its Mary Ann gas processing plant, with a capacity of 380-390 million cubic feet per day, will likely be fully restored by this weekend. Planned work at the plant in Coden, Alabama, began in mid-May.</p>
<p>NYMEX said 17,980 contracts traded at 1355 EDT.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, July edged up 0.7 cent to $1.955, while deferreds were unchanged. The East/West spread narrowed by 0.8 cent to 11.5 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
