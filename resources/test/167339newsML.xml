<p>German pharmaceutical wholesaler Gehe AG on Tuesday renewed its battle with rival British group UniChem Plc for control of Lloyds Chemists Plc by launching a fresh 650.6 million pound ($1.07 billion) bid.</p>
<p>Lloyds responded to the latest Gehe bid by advising its shareholders to take no action. UniChem said it believed that Gehe could obtain less value from Lloyds Chemists in ongoing cost savings and revenue benefits than UniChem.</p>
<p>Gehe has been locked in a takeover battle for Lloyds with Unichem since submitting a 650 million pound offer for the British drugs chain earlier this year.</p>
<p>Both Gehe's original bid, an all-cash offer pitched at 500p a share, along with a rival offer from Unichem, lapsed in March after being referred to Britain's competition authority, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.</p>
<p>Unichem, which already owns 9.9 percent of Lloyds, launched another bid on October 18 on the same terms as its offer that lapsed in March. It is offering 16 new Unichem shares and 926p in cash for every 10 Lloyds shares, valuing Lloyds at 657.6 million pounds.</p>
<p>This time around Gehe, Europe's largest drug distributor, is offering 500 pence in cash for each share in Lloyds and 322.6p in cash for each Lloyds preference share.</p>
<p>Dieter Kammerer, chairman of Gehe, said on Tuesday he was confident that Lloyds shareholders would accept its takeover bid.</p>
<p>"This is a highly attractive offer because unlike Unichem's bid it is all cash and is therefore risk-free for Lloyds' shareholders."</p>
<p>"I believe that our renewed offer of 500p per share in cash is notably generous given the deterioration in Lloyds Chemists' performance in the last financial year."</p>
<p>Lloyds in October reported pre-tax profits for the year to June 30 fell to 47 million pounds, down from 55.6 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>The British government has ruled that if either Unichem or Gehe are successful in acquiring Lloyds, they must sell off specified businesses within three months of the completed merger.</p>
<p>Shares in Lloyds Chemists were down 6p at 510-1/2 by 1240 GMT while Unichem shares were 3-1/2p higher at 255 pence. In Frankfurt Gehe shares were down 0.50 marks at 101.50 marks. ($1=.6107 Pound)</p>
