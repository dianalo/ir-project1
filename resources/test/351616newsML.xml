<p>A polling agent of the ethnic Mohajir National Movement (MQM) was killed and two people were wounded in election day violence in the Pakistani city of Karachi on Monday, MQM sources and ambulance workers said.</p>
<p>The MQM and its breakaway Haqiqi faction accused each other of harassment, and Haqiqi later announced a boycott of the elections an hour before polls closed.</p>
<p>Political sources said the boycott would not make much difference as the Haqiqi was not expected to win any parliamentary seats.</p>
<p>MQM spokesman Kunwar Khalid Younus said polling agent Mohammad Hanif had been kidnapped in the early hours and tortured by unidentified gunmen. He died in hospital.</p>
<p>Hanif was the brother of an MQM candidate for the Sindh Provincial Assembly, Mohammad Hussain. Each party nominates polling agents to observe voting at each polling station.</p>
<p>Ambulance workers said they had taken two wounded people to hospital from the Korangi area on Monday. At least three people were wounded in violence in District Central overnight.</p>
<p>The Karachi-based MQM accused the Haqiqi faction of harassing voters and trying to rig results in certain seats.</p>
<p>"Our polling agents were not allowed to enter a number of polling stations in Shah Faisal Colony, Malir, Orangi and Korangi," Younus told Reuters.</p>
<p>An MQM-Haqiqi spokesman denied the charges and said Haqiqi workers were being prevented from operating in Karachi's District Central, a stronghold of the mainstream MQM.</p>
<p>Witnesses said parts of Districts East and West were tense on Monday as gunmen fired in the air.</p>
<p>"In Shah Faisal, there is little election activity and shots and crackers are being fired at regular intervals since the morning despite the presence of the military," a witness said.</p>
<p>He said it seemed that control of the area was divided between the mainstream MQM and MQM-Haqiqi.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people have died in feuding between rival MQM factions in the past four years. The MQM is dominated by Urdu-speakers who migrated to Pakistan from India in 1947 and their descendants.</p>
<p>In troubled districts of Karachi, voting began several hours late. "At certain polling stations there were no polling staff, while polling agents of the MQM were absent in many places in Shah Faisal," said an army officer on duty.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the city, polling was peaceful but dull. The turn-out appeared to be low, except in Lyari, a traditional stronghold of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP).</p>
<p>President Farooq Leghari sacked Bhutto on November 5, accusing her government of corruption, nepotism and extra-judicial killings in Karachi. A caretaker government has been running the country until fresh elections could be held.</p>
<p>The main fight was between the Pakistan Muslim League of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and the PPP.</p>
<p>About 56.5 million Pakistanis aged 21 and over were eligible to vote in the elections for a new 217-seat National Assembly (lower house) and four provincial assemblies.</p>
