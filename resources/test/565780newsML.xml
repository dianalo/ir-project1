<p>Two Croatian journalists who work for a satirical paper noted for photo-montages of President Franjo Tudjman are to be retried on charges of insulting the president six months after a lower court acquitted them.</p>
<p>But the journalists said on Wednesday they would not cooperate with the retrial, claiming the justice system was immoral and controlled by the authorities.</p>
<p>Conflict between the conservative nationalist president  and Feral Tribune has strained relations with Western bodies like the Council of Europe, which named press freedom as a condition for Croatia joining the 54-nation body last year.</p>
<p>Tudjman has been annoyed by pictures which have portrayed him as a gangster with homburg hat and machine gun, side by side with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic dressed in studded sado-masochistic leather wear and as "Tumbo" -- the Croatian version of Sylvester Stallone's film character Rambo.</p>
<p>Last September the acquittal of Feral editor Viktor Ivancic and lead writer Marinko Culic by a municipal court was hailed as a much-needed boost for freedom of the press in Croatia. The case had been lodged by state prosecutors at Tudjman's behest.</p>
<p>The state-run Zagreb newspaper Vecernji List said on Tuesday the two would be retried on the same charges after a county court overruled the lower court decision to acquit them.</p>
<p>The Council of Europe decided in October to admit Croatia after a six-month delay over human-rights concerns. It had made press freedom one condition on membership in May 1996.</p>
<p>The organisation, which promotes democracy and human rights, is regarded as an antechamber to the European Union.</p>
<p>"The magazine is an irritant in the eyes of Tudjman and the leadership," said one senior diplomat.</p>
<p>"From a political point of view this comes at an awkward time. Domestically Tudjman has nothing to gain from this."</p>
<p>The paper said in a statement: "The decision of the county court...is in the view of Feral Tribune yet another story in the saga of the immorality of the Croatian justice system that is now completely dominated by the authorities.</p>
<p>"This is why Feral journalists and editors will reject any kind of cooperation and will refrain from taking part in the course of the trial."</p>
<p>Ivancic told Reuters: "We are definitely not going to take part in this travesty. There is such a close link between the legalislative bodies of the state and politics that we have no manoeuvring space.</p>
<p>"This is a coordinated political action to clear the media space," he said. "Currently we have a total of 50 cases worth some 4 million marks being brought against us. Their strategy is to try and make us pay damages and ruin us financially."</p>
