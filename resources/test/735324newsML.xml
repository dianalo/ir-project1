<p>The ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party said it agreed on Thursday to enact constitutional reforms demanded by an opposition-backed alliance before general elections.</p>
<p>If enacted, the reform proposals made by KANU would reduce the powers of President Daniel arap Moi, 73 and Kenya's ruler for 19 years who agreed under pressure to multiparty politics in 1991.</p>
<p>KANU Vice-President George Saitoti, who holds the same post in the government, told a news conference KANU's proposals for change would be debated and adopted by parliament in its current session, meaning before presidential and parliamentary polls.</p>
<p>The shock announcement by the ruling party led by Moi dumbfounded opposition leaders, who earlier announced a list of new "mass actions" in Kenya to keep the heat on the president.</p>
<p>The president had before Thursday held that there was no time for any constitutional reforms before elections this year.</p>
<p>Saitoti said the reforms were agreed at a meeting of KANU's National Executive Committee, chaired by President Moi.</p>
<p>He said the NEC recommended the government publish a statute allowing the repeal or amendment of laws opposition figures called bad or oppressive. KANU has a parliamentary majority.</p>
<p>Asked by reporters if KANU was reacting to pressure, Saitoti said: "We have agreed to enact these changes. There have been no delays in the matter, we wanted to take in the wishes of everyone."</p>
<p>"They (the opposition) asked for so-called minimum constitutional reforms. We have not only agreed to these, but have also proposed that comprehensive reforms be examined," said NEC member Nicholas Biwott, a government minister of state.</p>
<p>Asked for his reaction to the surprise announcement from KANU, opposition politician Richard Leakey told Reuters:</p>
<p>"If this is actually truthful and it is implemented I think a very great many people in the opposition will be very pleased."</p>
<p>"We have to be sure this is not a time-wasting measure," said Leakey, who is secretary-general of the unregistered Safina party and on the National Convention Executive Committee (NCEC), an alliance of pro-reform opposition parties and other bodies.</p>
<p>"If this is what we have been asking for and they have agreed to it then I cannot criticise it if this is a sincere offer," added Leakey, Kenya's foreign wildlife guardian and a renowned palaeontologist.</p>
<p>Saitoti said the KANU NEC met on Thursday and recommended that the government publish a bill in parliament establishing a commission to review the constitution and make proposals.</p>
<p>He said bills to be repealed or amended included the Public Order Act regulating public meetings, the Preservation of Public Security Act providing for detention without trial and the Societies Act, under which all parties must be registered.</p>
<p>The repeal of the Societies Act would allow Leakey's Safina party to operate. Safina applied for registration more than two years ago but Kenyan authorities have so far not registered it.</p>
<p>Saitoti said KANU wanted repeal or amendment to the National Assembly and Presidential Elections Act, which the opposition has said favoured KANU as well as the Vagrancy Act allowing police to detain anyone on suspicion they might be vagabonds.</p>
<p>The opposition-backed NCEC earlier called for a list of mass actions including a rally in Kenya's second city of Mombasa, centre of its tourism industry, on the Indian Ocean coast on July 26 and a national general strike and sit-in on August 8.</p>
<p>Moi agreed on Wednesday to discuss reforms with opposition leaders next week and agreed with religious leaders on Tuesday on the need to review the constitution. But no date was set.</p>
<p>Riot police on July 7 violently broke up rallies in Nairobi and several other cities and towns and at least nine people were killed in the worst political violence in Kenya in seven years.</p>
<p>The July 7 violence, which closed the capital, was followed by days of student unrest in the city, prompting the closure of two universities followed by the Kenya Polytechnic on Monday.</p>
