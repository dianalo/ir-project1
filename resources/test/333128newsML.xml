<p>Failed third-party U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot on Saturday lashed out at President Bill Clinton and mainstream politics for taking  his ideas and blamed his poor showing in the November elections on being excluded from the debates.</p>
<p>Trying to pick up the pieces from his presidential bid in which he got only 8 percent of the vote, the Texas billionaire kicked off a two-day organising meeting of his self-styled Reform Party that itself remained paralysed by factionalism.</p>
<p>Even before the meeting started, tense arguments erupted between competing delegations from five states -- Tennessee, Illinois, Florida, New Jersey and New York. The divisions centred on whether Perot will continue to hold sway over the party, or whether party members will guide it.</p>
<p>Those involved in the disputes were shuttled to private rooms to hear the arguments and decide who would join the delegates representing 44 states meeting at a Nashville hotel. Sitting delegates refused to approve a meeting agenda until the question over credentials could be resolved.</p>
<p>In his introductory address to the roughly 500 delegates, Perot urged his supporters not to engage in the pitfalls of "power grabbing" that would disrupt the party.</p>
<p>"We must set a whole new standard for politics if this party is to succeed and really help this country," he said in a 20-minute speech covering an array of topics from campaign finance reform, to the budget deficit to U.S. aid to Mexico.</p>
<p>Continuing where he left off during the fall campaign, Perot accused Clinton of proposing "sham reforms" of campaign finance rules and ethical standards that he said neither major party was sincere about adopting.</p>
<p>"These same people who broke all the rules are now saying we've got to clean this up," said Perot, who grouped House of Representatives Speaker Newt Gingrich and his ethics problems in with the Clinton campaign's acceptance of foreign campaign contributions.</p>
<p>"You repent, you're sorry, and once you see the polls you lead the effort to clean it up," he said of Clinton.</p>
<p>Perot also slammed the mainstream parties for co-opting his agenda, which focused on the federal budget deficit, entitlement programmes and trade.</p>
<p>"Look to the priorities of the present administration and it looks a lot like the principles on which this party was founded," Perot told cheering supporters.</p>
<p>Perot blamed his poor showing in the 1996 elections -- compared to 19 percent of the vote he garnered in 1992 -- on being denied a spot in the presidential debates alongside Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole. Perot did participate in the 1992 debates.</p>
<p>"We understand now and we did before, if you don't participate in the debates, you don't have a chance to compete," he said.</p>
<p>Political analysts have argued that the "protest" vote that Perot got in 1992 was diminished by the healthy economy four years later, and that Perot himself alienated supporters.</p>
<p>Perot easily captured the nomination of his Reform Party over former Colorado Gov. Dick Lamm, but many within his own party viewed the process as rigged.</p>
<p>"If Perot wants control of the party, there's nothing we can do about it," said Ted Muga, a member of the party's California board of directors.</p>
<p>Muga called Perot "damaged goods" and said he was unelectable. "To attract national leaders to a larger base of independent voters we have to break from this association with a single force (Perot)," Muga said in an interview.</p>
<p>Pat Choate, who was Perot's vice presidential choice, said it would be a huge mistake for party members to forsake Perot.</p>
<p>"He's our trump card in national politics," Choate said. "We have someone in Ross Perot who can mount a national compaign. It's him and his money. He knows the issues and he has a core group of the electorate who really idolise him."</p>
<p>Choate, who said he would prefer not to be a candidate next time around, said the absence of an incumbent president in the next election in 2000 would open the door for Perot.</p>
