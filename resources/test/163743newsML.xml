<p>Uganda and Sudan on Monday signed a draft peace agreement after Iranian-brokered talks over tensions caused by mutual accusations of harbouring rebels, Iran's foreign minister and Tehran radio said.</p>
<p>Ugandan Foreign Minister Eriya Kategaya and his Sudanese counterpart Ali Osman Mohammad Taha signed a memorandum of understanding of peace which said that the next round of talks would be held in Uganda in December, the state-run radio said.</p>
<p>"There are clear and encouraging signs that the peace talks are making progress. The realisation of this great humanitarian endeavour needs more time," Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati was quoted by the radio as saying.</p>
<p>The radio gave no further details, but reporters quoted Velayati as saying at the signing ceremony that the memorandum was a "draft peace accord."</p>
<p>Iran's media had said earlier a peace deal would be signed at the end of the two-day talks between Sudan and Uganda, which accuse each other of backing anti-government rebels.</p>
<p>Velayati and Malawi's Foreign Minister George Ntafu also signed the memorandum during the ceremony attended by Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.</p>
<p>Malawi, which has mediated in the past between Sudan and Uganda, has been attending the Iranian-sponsored talks.</p>
<p>Representatives of Sudan and Uganda held talks in Tehran in early October to follow up on a September pact, mediated by Rafsanjani on a trip to Khartoum and Kampala, under which the two states agreed to halt their activities in the border area.</p>
<p>Sudan said in late October it was abiding by the agreement with Uganda and that a monitoring group would soon start work to ensure that neither government helps rebels in the border area.</p>
<p>Under the pact, the two governments also agreed to stop hostile propaganda campaigns, destroy rebel positions and supply centres, move all refugees and rebels at least 100 km (60 miles) inside the border and encourage the voluntary repatriation of refugees from the two countries.</p>
