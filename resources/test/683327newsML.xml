<p>TCF Financial Corp said Tuesday it had extended to June 30 its solicitation of consents from holders of Winthrop Resources Corp's 9.50 percent senior notes due 2003.</p>
<p>The expiration date was previously June 23.</p>
<p>As part of its proposed merger with Winthrop, TCF agreed to become co-obligor on the notes if a majority of the $28.75 million principal amount of outstanding notes consented to the elimination of certain covenants.</p>
<p>TCF said it expects to complete the merger today, pending approval by shareholders of both companies.</p>
