<headline>RTRS - Newcrest to unveil gold hedge policy.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-10-18</dateline>

<p>Newcrest Mining Ltd which in August unwound two million ounces of forward gold sales, said on Friday it had not abandoned hedging strategies and would unveil a new programme on October 24.</p>
<p>"In the current environment, vanilla forwards are not the utmost in our minds," John Quinn, managing director of Newcrest, said at a meeting of analysts here.</p>
<p>"Quite clearly we've done something but you'll have to wait until Thursday (October 24) for that," Quinn said later.</p>
<p>Newcrest is scheduled to release its September quarter report on October 24.  </p>
<p>Newcrest shares closed 18 cents higher on Friday at A$4.47, but Quinn declined to comment on any influences on the share price.</p>
<p>He told the analysts Newcrest's goal was to become a producer of one million ounces or more, pointing to active exploration both in Australia and offshore.</p>
<p>"We will spend approximately A$60 million to $A70 million this year," Quinn said. "If results justify it, we'll spend a little more."  </p>
<p>Newcrest is spending about two-thirds of its exploration funds in Australia, Quinn said.</p>
<p>Quinn gave no timetable for the disposal of the company's 14.9 percent stake in Normandy Mining Ltd, but said he doubted the stake would be on the books in two years.</p>
<p>"Don't let me suggest that it isn't under the water at the moment because it is," Quinn said.</p>
<p>Newcrest spent A$500 million to purchase the stake in Normandy and 12.5 percent in its subsidiary Posgold Ltd ahead of a first round of meetings over a merger, in which it unsuccessfully demanded to be included.  </p>
<p>Quinn said he expected the company's Cadia mine in New South Wales and its Gosowong prospect in Halmahera Islands of Indonesia to come on stream in 1998.</p>
<p>It also is prospecting elsewhere in Indonesia and Asia and in Latin America and Nevada, where it has the the Iron Point and Tuscarora properties.</p>
<p>"Nevada is getting less than its fair share of exploration," Quinn said.</p>
