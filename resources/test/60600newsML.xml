<p>Apple Computer Inc and Sun Microsystems Inc on Wednesday unveiled an agreement to link  more closely their technologies, including the ability to link 'seamlessly' Apple's Macintosh  personal computer and Sun's network servers.</p>
<p>"We believe it is a very major step forward for both companies," Apple executive vice president and chief administrative officer George Scalise said in a conference call from Atlanta, Ga. He said the move offers customers an alternative to the dominant technology suppliers in the PC industry, Microsoft Corp and Intel Corp.  </p>
<p>"They now have a compelling alternative to the 'Wintel' offering," he said, referring to the industry term for the combination of Windows software and Intel microchips.</p>
<p>The announcement is particularly important for Apple's large customers, who will be able now to combine Apple's desktop machines and technologies with networks operating on Sun Microsystems' Solaris system.</p>
<p>Analysts said that though the alliance focusses on making the company's technologies work together, it will be viewed in part as a follow-on to industry talk earlier this year that Sun was prepared to acquire Apple outright.  </p>
<p>Apple Chief Technolology Officer Ellen Hancock, who joined Apple along with Scalise as part of chief executive Gilbert Amelio's effort to turn around the company, said the agreement involves five areas of cooperation:</p>
<p>-- support to provide 'seamless interoperability' between Apple's Macintosh computers on the desktop and Sun's Solaris-based network servers.</p>
<p>-- provide interoperability between Sun's Java Beans technology, designed to enable developers to write re-usable software components that can run on virtually all systems, and the similar OpenDoc technology initiative supported by Apple.  </p>
<p>Hancock said Apple would provide support within Macintosh and Sun's Solstice system to enable Macintosh computers to be managed using Sun's network management technology, along with a number of leading network, Internet-related technologies.</p>
<p>The two companies have also established a joint interoperability laboratory to provide systems integration capabilities for the two companies' technologies.</p>
<p>Janpieter Scheerder, the president of Sun's Sunsoft unit, said the technology alliance was focused on allowing customers access to "best of breed" technologies, saying the alliance will enable developers to distribute products more easily.  </p>
<p>He said it would also further Sun's efforts to enable developers to "write once, run everywhere and to get the volume instantaneously" -- that ability to run software on a wide variety of differing computer systems.</p>
<p>However, Scheerder dismissed a reporter's question on whether Sun and Apple might yet merge, given previous talk of a buyout before Amelio took the helm in February.</p>
<p>"These discussions haved nothing to do any other rumors and I can't comment on anything," he said.  </p>
<p>"This is a normal continuation of what Sun has done for a long time now -- we try to interconnect with other platforms as much as possible, using technologies like the Internet, using technologies that go cross-platform like Java," he said.</p>
<p>He said Sun would continue to work closely with other computer companies, like IBM. "So, those rumors, I don't know what to say to them," he added.</p>
<p>Apple executives have repeatedly said since Amelio took charge that they were aiming to put the company on solid, independent footing although they would look to strategic alliances, such as the one with Sun, as well.</p>
<p>Scalise said the deal "builds on our strategy to leverage the converging megatrends of the Internet and multimedia. It's going to strengthen both companies as a consequence."</p>
<p>"This alliance is our first step on moving forward on a long-range relationship that takes us down the path of multimedia Internet-Intranet opportunities in the future."</p>
<p>Shares of Apple rose one to 24, while Sun gained 1-1/4 to 59-3/4. In Europe, Amelio also told reporters earlier that he expects Apple to return to profitability in its second fiscal quarter ending March 1997.</p>
<p>He said the company had cut costs by $140 million since he took charge seven months ago and that liquidity was now between $1.3 and $1.4 billion.</p>
