<p>Bangladesh taka closed firmer in the interbank trade on Thursday after the central bank said it was adjusting the currency downwards effective Saturday.</p>
<p>The taka closed at 42.2330/2430 compared to its previous close of 42.2400/2450, dealers said. It remained strong on lower demand for dollars from importers after opening at 42.2300/2400.</p>

The interbank call money rates closed at 4.5 percent to 5.25 percent against the previous 5.0-5.5 percent, dealers said. -- Dhaka Newsroom 880-2-506363</p>
