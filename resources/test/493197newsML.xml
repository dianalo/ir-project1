<p>Sky-watchers delighted by comet Hale-Bopp have another treat to look forward to next year -- a showy meteor shower, British astronomers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Leonid meteor shower, which comes around every 33 years, should produce a "spectacular" display in November of next year, Iwan Williams of London's Queen Mary and Westfield College said.</p>
<p>"The display will be spectacular but not awesome -- that is several thousand meteors per hour," Williams told Britain's annual National Astronomy Meeting in Southampton.</p>
<p>The Leonids -- so-called because they seem to appear in the constellation Leo -- are dust from comet Temple-Tuttle, first named in 1865.</p>
<p>The dust is still in a large clump near the comet and so the showers are visible when the Earth passes through the clump.</p>
<p>Hale-Bopp is still visible in the northern sky. The comet, which scientists reckon appears every 3,000 years or so, is shooting off a great deal of material that catches the sun's light and creates a bright tail.</p>
