<p>A strike closed the international airport in French Guiana on Thursday for the third time since rioting rocked the territory last month, airport officials said.</p>
<p>Riot police patrolled the streets of the capital Cayenne late on Wednesday after five days of negotiations between farmers and the French government broke down.</p>
<p>Farmers blocked an access road to the French government prefecture building for several hours with farm equipment, breaking windows, burning piles of straw and spreading manure in front of the building. There were no reports of injuries.</p>
<p>The farmers are protesting government loan repayment programmes and land title policies in this French overseas territory on the northeast coast of South America.</p>
<p>Riots in November by armed gangs of organised youths caused one death and millions of dollars of damage to shops and government buildings. Paris flew in 500 paramilitary riot police to the city of 35,000 people.</p>
<p>The riots were sparked by a strike of high school students protesting against poor conditions in local schools. They were joined by more radical groups, some of whom favour French Guiana's independence from Paris.</p>
<p>Farmers on Tuesday set fire to a government agriculture building, causing extensive damage to computers and records, officials said.</p>
