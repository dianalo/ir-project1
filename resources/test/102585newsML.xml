<p>Some of the computer industry's leading spokesmen admitted Monday that they use too many buzzwords and build complicated products that are not always useful in everyday life.</p>
<p>A blue-ribbon panel from Silicon Valley and elsewhere agreed that building easier-to-use products was the best way of bringing more people into the new digital world.</p>
<p>But they said consumers have all too often been bombarded with needless software updates while being distracted by competing software "wars" waged by the big computer players.</p>
<p>"People do want more stability and things have to become more simple," commented Ted Waite, chairman of Gateway 2000, one of the largest direct personal computer sellers.</p>
<p>Waite said consumers have every right to be frustrated with personal computers that have become difficult to use and cost too much to maintain because of their complexity.</p>
<p>Speaking at an annual Gartner Group computer conference, the executives said consumers, both at home and at work, were confused by a huge selection of products.</p>
<p>"We are tyrannized by the amount of choices out there," said Gary Fernandes, vice chairman of the consulting firm EDS Corp. "The product life cycle is getting smaller and smaller."</p>
<p>They said there has been too much emphasis on the various competing operating software "platforms" available while the market was also being hurt by software updates that in fact offer very little in useful new features.</p>
<p>The industry also needs to drop the jargon and speak clearer so consumers can make proper choices.</p>
<p>"We have technical clutter," said Fernandes, "We speak in buzzwords and acronyms."</p>
<p>The chairman and CEO of Apple Computer Inc. Gilbert Amelio, said with only about 10 percent of the world having access to a personal computer, one of the bigger challenges facing the industry was bringing more people into the new digital environment.</p>
<p>He said the quickest way to do that was to bring to market products that really make a difference in people's lives.</p>
<p>He said all the attention focused on the so-called "browser wars" -- on whether Microsoft Corp. or Netscape Communications Corp. offered better software to cruise the Internet -- was really a waste of time.</p>
<p>He said browsing was essentially an unproductive activity and companies really need to focus on making products that make the Internet a useful tool for people to find information and to communicate.</p>
<p>"Right now browsing has a negative productivity factor, instead of a positive one. The question is how do we get people more productive," he said.</p>
