<p>Unison HealthCare Corp on Friday said President and Chief Executive Officer Jerry Walker has been placed on administrative leave after the company said it would restate earnings for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 1996.</p>
<p>David Kremser, chairman of the board of directors' executive committee, will assume Walker' responsibilities on an interim basis, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Unison, a long-term and specialty care health services provider, announced on March 19 that it expected to restate its financial results due to accounting inaccuracies.  </p>
<p>At the same time, the company said it had hired a law firm to conduct a special review of the facts and circumstances surrounding the restatement.</p>
<p>"I fully endorse the decision of the executive committee which places me on administrative leave until the ongoing independent investigation is completed," Walker was quoted as saying.  "Such an action ensures full and impartial disclosure from all employees and will help bring the investigation to a timely conclusion."</p>
