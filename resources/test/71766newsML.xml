<p>Egyptian consumer prices were 9.4 percent in the period up to the end of July, up from 8.3 percent in the year to June and 8.5 percent in July 1995, the cabinet office said in a bulletin available on Monday.</p>
<p>It was the highest inflation figure since the end of August last year, when inflation stood at 9.7 percent. It then hit a 30-year low of 4.9 percent at the end of November 1995.</p>
<p>The cabinet gave no breakdown to show what elements contributed to the latest rise, but it said consumer prices rose 1.0 percent during the month of July alone.</p>
