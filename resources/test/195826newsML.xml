<p>France's protoype Superphenix fast-breeder nuclear reactor has been restarted after a 12-day shutdown for repairs, nuclear industry news agency NucNet said on Monday.</p>
<p>NucNet reported plant operators NERSA as saying the repairs had been made to a sodium circulation pump.</p>
<p>The reactor was stopped on November 6 to replace a faulty bearing which had been causing vibrations on one of four primary pumps. The bearing acts as a drive shaft between the motor and the pump.</p>
<p>The 60 billion franc reactor has been dogged by problems since ite was commissioned 20 years ago and has operated for only a dozen months.</p>
<p>The plant currently operates as a research and development site looking into the recycling of nuclear waste, well short of its original design as a fast breeder producing more plutonium than it burns when generating electricity.</p>
