<p>Earnings flowing from an acquisition spree in Europe over the past two years are expected to boost year profits by 50 percent at South African information technology firm Persetel Holdings Ltd, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>Twelve months of income from computer distributor Comparex, bought last year from German chemicals giant BASF AG, and this year's purchase of a 70 percent stake in Germany's Telemation Netzwerk AG are seen as key factors in the surge.</p>
<p>"Essentially the results will be up on acquisitional growth. They have Telemation and ComTech in there for the first time. They also have 12 months of Comparex," said one analyst who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Persetel in April said it had bought a 70 percent holding in ComTech, a leading systems integrator in Belgium and Luxembourg. The buy, to be funded from internal cash, was effective from December 31, 1996.</p>
<p>Persetel is due to report earnings for the year to end-May next Thursday.</p>
<p>Analysts polled by Reuters forecast earnings rising to within a narrow band of 68.0 and 70.0 cents a share with consensus at 69.3 cents -- a rise of 50.0 percent on last year's 46.2 cents.</p>
<p>They expected a dividend of between 27.0 and 28.0 cents, averaging out at 27.6 from 19.0 cents a year ago.</p>
<p>The acquisitive group, which has said that it aimed to source around 60 percent of its earnings offshore by 2000, is currently in talks on a Brazilian investment.</p>
<p>But analysts said the offshore focus came somewhat at the expense of local operations.</p>
<p>"Their local businesses are having a tougher time, particularly the networking side," one analyst said.</p>
<p>Following a 57.5 percent surge in half year share earnings announced in February, Persetel shares fell sharply on some concerns that its South African activities had not performed as well as expected.</p>
<p>The group at the time said that in the short term its local business might be negatively affected by the timing of the completion of certain large contracts and a heavy interest burden resulting from high asset levels in its PC unit.</p>
