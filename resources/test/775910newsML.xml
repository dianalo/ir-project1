<p>Technicians look for a deepening retracement in U.S. Treasury bond futures following the market's abrupt change of direction Friday.</p>
<p>Bond futures' nearly two-point slide Friday was fueled by the second-largest single-day volume in the contract's history, underscoring the significance of the decline, noted Alex Saitta, analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc.</p>
<p>Friday's volume total for bond futures of 744,628 contracts was second in size only to volume on Feb. 17, 1994, when 760,885 bond futures traded, according to Chicago Board of Trade figures.  </p>
<p>September bond futures this morning slipped below 114-19/32, the 38.2-percent retracement of the advance from the June 30 low to last week's 116-31 high and a support level that many analysts had been watching.</p>
<p>By afternoon, the contract was resting at moderately lower levels, down 11/32 at 114-15/32.</p>
<p>September bonds are now on course to test the 50-percent retracement of July upmove, which comes in at 113-27/32, Saitta said. Below that level lies the 61.8-percent retracement at 112-26/32.  </p>
<p>Eric Marshall Wall, senior technical analyst for MMS International Inc, identified critical support for the 30-year Treasury at 6.50-6.55 percent on a yield basis.</p>
<p>The cash bond yield was recently hovering near 6.50 percent.</p>
<p>The 6.55 percent yield equates roughly with 113-19/32 to 113-20/32 in futures, Wall said. "If we start to get below there, you're going to have more liquidation come into the market," he said.  </p>
<p>If yields push above the 6.50-6.55 percent band, that would be the time to re-evaluate longer-term long positions in bonds, Wall said. Until then, the steep upward channel that has guided bond futures since April retains a tenuous grasp.</p>
<p>"I can't really become bearish until we move through that level," said the analyst.</p>
