<p>Entrepreneur Andrew Regan's ambitious plan to takeover Britain's Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) collapsed unexpectedly on Thursday, although the legal battle between the two sides is set to continue on Friday.</p>
<p>Regan's special bidding company Galileo Group made a brief statement saying it would not pursue its proposal to turn the mutually-owned CWS into a limited company and then make an offer for it.</p>
<p>But a CWS spokesman told Reuters the 153-year-old supermarkets to funeral parlours group had not been formally notified of Galileo's apparent change of heart, and legal action against it and various other parties involved in the bid would continue.</p>
<p>"There has been no formal communication (from Galileo) with the CWS this morning...As it stands the legal action (against Galileo and various other parties) goes ahead tomorrow," he said.</p>
<p>Galileo said it would not pursue its bid after CWS chairman Lennox Fyfe on Wednesday rejected a plea for an end to legal proceedings and an invitation to put Galileo's plans to CWS members. Fyfe also instructed CWS directors to hand Galileo's proposals back "unopened and unread".</p>
<p>"In the light of this response, Galileo announces that it will not be pursuing its proposal," it said. Regan has been stalking the Co-op for several months but an expected 1.2 billion pound ($1.9 billion) bid was thwarted by CWS legal action last Friday.</p>
<p>This resulted from CWS hiring private investigators to film Regan, his business associate David Lyons and suspended CWS manager Allan Green. On Wednesday Regan and his team handed back a total of seven boxes of documents which Galileo said had been passed to it voluntarily by a CWS employee.</p>
<p>Galileo's apparent climb-down follows a high-profile and aggressive defence by CWS involving a High Court injunction and CWS making its concerns about a payment in a previous deal with Regan known to Britain's Serious Fraud Office.</p>
<p>CWS has interests ranging from farms and opticians to the profitable Co-operative Bank and a large insurance arm. Galileo's plan was widely reported to be to sell-off the CWS assets to unlock what one banking source described as "hidden value".</p>
<p>Galileo, an offshoot of 31-year-old Regan's Guernsey-based investment trust Lanica, had the backing of several City institutions as well as Japanese securities firm Nomura.</p>
<p>Its interest in CWS first became public in February and led to the suspension of Lanica's shares on the London Stock Exchange at 19.37 pounds. The shares were star performers last year, rising from 203 pence when Regan took over.</p>
<p>Banking sources said the Stock Exchange would be meeting with Lanica to discuss relisting the shares, but this was not expected to take place imminently.</p>
<p>Despite its poorly performing retail business, CWS has consistently rejected any suggestion of selling any of its businesses to Regan or anyone else. The group's complex structure has also been seen as a major barrier to any hostile takeover.</p>
<p>Galileo never made a formal offer for the CWS but there has been widespread speculation that it is now "in play" with other parties interested in taking over parts of its varied empire.</p>
<p>No other bidders have yet emerged but Ireland's Allied Irish Banks said on Monday it would be interested in buying the Co-op Bank while British retailer Sainsbury has been rumoured as a buyer of some of the CWS retail outlets but has declined to comment on such "speculation".</p>
