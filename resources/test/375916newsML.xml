<p>Geneva private banks Banque D'Investissements Prives (BIP) and Compagnie Bancaire Geneve (CBG) will merge to join forces against growing competition, BIP director general Alain Peytral said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Peytral told Reuters that CBG would take over BIP by the end of March to form a new bank with a capital of 110 million Swiss Francs ($75 million) and combined assets under management of more than 6 billion Swiss Francs ($4.1 billion).</p>
<p>The merger would be completed by end-1997 and Peytral would stay as director general. No lay-offs were foreseen.</p>
<p>No sum was disclosed for the deal, but banking sources put it at well over 50 million Swiss Francs ($34 million)</p>
<p>Competition is heating up in the Swiss private banking arena following the arrival of Wall Street powerhouses like Merrill Lynch, forcing old, established banks to be more aggressive.</p>
<p>Some Swiss bankers are worried about fee erosion and many expect mergers and acquisitions to pick up pace this year.</p>
<p>Peytral said: "Competition is tough. We need a good size, a better team and more efficiency to deal with it. We have to work harder to make profits grow."</p>
<p>CBG is owned 60 percent by two private Swiss shareholders and the remainder by Banque Cantonale de Geneve.</p>
<p>The majority shareholders of BIP, founded in 1951, are two Luxembourg-based companies controlled by Belgian and French groups -- Socfinasia and Socfinal.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, U.S. brokerage house Lehman Brothers sold its fully-owned Swiss private bank in Geneva to Vancouver-based Canadian asset management and financial services group MFC Financial Corp for an undisclosed sum.</p>
