<p>Indian electrical engineering firm Crompton Greaves Ltd said on Tuesday it was zeroing in on the country's state-run electricity boards as buyers for a new energy-efficient transformer it will launch in a year.</p>
<p>"We have already made a few prototypes," said Ranjan Dasgupta, president of the firm's Power Systems division. "Within six months to eight months, we'll start supplying them to customers...It will really take off in the next two years."</p>
<p>Crompton Greaves is making medium-sized, amorphous metal transformers with materials supplied by U.S. engineered materials maker Allied Signal International Inc .</p>
<p>The transformers with KVA ratings of 500 or higher are best-suited for power utilities in urban areas, hospitals and cinemas and will be for both export and domestic markets, company officials said.</p>
<p>Dasgupta said they will cut core power losses by up to 80 percent compared to conventional transformers.</p>
<p>"India's distribution sector uses around 150,000 transformers annually," said G.L. Dua, a power consultant with Allied Signals. "About 10 percent of that market falls within this category."</p>
<p>Dua estimated the market for the amorphous metal type of transformer at about one to two billion rupees ($55.9 million) annually.</p>
<p>"It's a question of a choice between imported energy inefficient materials and imported energy-efficient material," Dua said, adding that India currently imports all its transformer core material.</p>
<p>A number of state-run firms like the Bombay Electric Supply and Transport Undertaking (BEST), the Delhi Electricity Supply Undertaking (DESU), the Calcutta Electric Supply Company have also shown interest, Dasgupta said.</p>
<p>Though India's loss-making utilities were not in a position to pay for new equipment, Dasgupta said "the scenario has to change."</p>
<p>Firms like BSES and Ahmedabad Electricity Co Ltd have also already asked for prototypes, Dasgupta said.</p>
<p>"Our current orderbook for transformers is in excess of four billion rupees," he said. "Fifty percent of them are for export."</p>
<p>He predicted half the production would be exported within two years, possibly to Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Dasgupta said Crompton Greaves' 1997/98 results would still only match or perhaps be worse than last year's poor performance.</p>
<p>But he noted "we have already blocked the power systems orderbook with export orders. Seventy-six percent of the capacity at our Kanjurmarg plant has been booked with export orders."</p>
<p>Britain's BTR Plc, a diversified conglomerate, has a 16-percent stake in Crompton Greaves. ($ = 35.80 Indian Rupees)</p>
