<p>Zaire's state owned copper giant Gecamines on Sunday signed its first major joint venture with a foreign company, the Swiss-based groupe Lundin, despite a spreading civil war in the east of the country.</p>
<p>"Everything was finally signed and sealed between three and four this morning," said Lundin official Charlie Pettifer.  </p>
<p>Lundin's group, representing the Canadian company Eurocan Consolidated Ventures, won agreement on Friday from the Zaire government to mine vast resources of copper and cobalt at Tenke Fungurume in the Southern Shaba province.</p>
<p>Pettifer told Reuters the signing of the final accord with Gecamines was delayed until the early hours of Sunday as four government ministers had to initial about 2,000 pages of contract documents in French and English.</p>
<p>"This is the rebirth of Zaire's mining industry, Lundin group chief Adolph Lundin told Reuters.</p>
