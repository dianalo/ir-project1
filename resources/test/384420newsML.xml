<p>Russian Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov vowed on Tuesday to fight tax evasion but said the government planned no emergency steps to enforce tax payment.</p>
<p>"I am categorically opposed to extraordinary measures," Kulikov told a news conference following his promotion on February 4 to the rank of deputy prime minister with responsibilities for fighting economic crime.</p>
<p>Kulikov, who now has charge of the tax police, customs and the other agencies tackling economic crime, said only 16 percent of Russian companies met their full tax obligations last year and the forces fighting such crime must be better coordinated.</p>
<p>"This shows we need a united approach and strategy, and that one organ must be in control and coordinate," he said.</p>
<p>He said Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had approved an initiative to make an inventory of tax privileges, which cost the state billions of dollars a year, and that the cabinet would discuss a draft new tax code on Thursday.</p>
<p>The government says widespread tax evasion is a prime cause of long delays in the payment of wages and pensions to millions of Russians.</p>
<p>The government has made improvement of tax collection one of its priorities and launched a television advertising campaign to try to persuade people to abide by the law.</p>
<p>The bad tax revenues prompted the International Monetary Fund to withhold two tranches of its latest credit late last year, relenting only when more tax money finally started to come in.</p>
<p>Official figurers show that tax arrears rose to 128.25 trillion roubles ($23 billion) at the start of this year, more than twice the level at the start of 1996.</p>
