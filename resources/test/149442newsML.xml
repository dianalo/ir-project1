<p>Belgium retained its position as the world's leading diamond centre in the first nine months of 1996 despite uncertain conditions in the sector, the Antwerp-based Diamond High Council (DHC) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"1996 has been a year in which uncertainty prevailed," the council said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Negotiations on the renewal of the contract between De Beers and Russia, the split between De Beers and Australia, rumours on the possible price increase in July of certain categories of rough diamonds which narrowed profit margins (all) increased competition," it said.</p>
<p>"Even in these hard market conditions...Antwerp succeeded in confirming its fame as the leading diamond centre in the world," it added.</p>
<p>It said the first nine months were marked by a 14 percent rise of imports in value to $8.70 billion despite a decrease in weight of nine percent to 152 million carats.</p>
<p>Exports rose seven percent in value to $8.44 billion and increased nearly a fifth in weight to 126 million carats.</p>
<p>Total turnover in dollar terms rose 11 percent to $17.15 billion.</p>
