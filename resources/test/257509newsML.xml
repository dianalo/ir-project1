<p>Pilots of Japan's All Nippon Airways went on strike on Sunday, forcing the airline to cancel 148 flights, about 30 percent of its domestic operations, a company official said.</p>
<p>"Around 3 out of 10 of our internal flights are cut... meaning the flights of around 22,000 passengers have been cancelled," said a spokesman for the airline, Japan's second-largest.</p>
<p>"The situation is under control and our other flights are operating as normal," he said.</p>
<p>The union, representing pilots, co-pilots and flight engineers, is protesting against a new wage and seniority system introduced in April.</p>
<p>At Haneda airport, the main domestic airport for the Tokyo region, special counters were set up for customers whose planes had been grounded because of the strike.</p>
<p>ANA said it is reimbursing customers or providing alternate air travel arrangements.</p>
<p>It is the second time the pilots have staged a walkout in the dispute, although a union spokesman said no more industrial action would be taken this year.</p>
<p>In the larger November strike, 357 flights were cancelled, affecting 60,000 passengers.</p>
