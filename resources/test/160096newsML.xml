<headline>BT, MCI deal would be biggest yet in industry.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-01</dateline>

<p>A merger between British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp. could be the biggest yet in the rapidly changing telecommunications industry and the second largest involving a U.S. company.</p>
<p>If completed, a deal would also rank as the biggest trans-Atlantic merger, according to Securities Data Corp., which tracks and values mergers.</p>
<p>Washington-based MCI, the nation's second-biggest long-distance carrier, said Friday it was in talks to be bought by British Telecom, and industry analysts speculated that a deal could be worth about $22.1 billion.</p>
<p>That would be bigger than the proposed merger between Nynex Corp. and Bell Atlantic Corp., two regional Bell companies, worth $21.3 billion, according to Securities Data. The merger was announced on April 22 and the companies hope to complete it by year-end or early in 1997.</p>
<p>The British Telecom-MCI deal would be the largest between a British and American company, and it would rank as the second biggest ever involving a U.S. company, behind the RJR Nabisco Inc. buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co. worth $30.6 billion including debt, according to Securities Data.</p>
<p>Other big telecommunications mergers include SBC Communications Inc.'s proposed $16.5 billion takeover of Pacific Telesis Group, announced on April 1, and AT&amp;T Corp.'s purchase of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. in 1994 for $15.65 billion. The values are from Securities Data.</p>
<p>MCI said it expected talks to conclude this weekend but noted there were no guarantees an agreement would be reached. A spokesman for British Telecom confirmed the British company was interested in a merger with MCI.</p>
<p>Industry analysts speculated that a final deal would price MCI at about $40 a share, making the 80 percent that British Telecom does not already own worth $22.11 billion, based on MCI's 691 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>British Telecom wants to offer a blend of cash and stock for the rest of MCI, a source close to the deal told Reuters. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said a price was not finalised but that an announcment was expected on Sunday, if not before.</p>
<p>In Washington, lawyers and analysts said a British Telecom-MCI deal would probably win approval from U.S. regulators. Federal rules adopted last year allow a foreign carrier to buy more than 25 percent of a domestic telecom company if the overseas company's home market is deemed open to competition.</p>
