<p>Russia's Sayansk Aluminium called on Wednesday for protectionist measures against foreign aluminium products and said it would seek better prices for raw materials, shipping and energy.</p>
<p>Sayansk, Russia's third largest primary aluminium producer, gave no dates or indication of the levels it would seek to pay for supplies and transport.</p>
<p>It said in a statement it had planned negotiations with suppliers of raw materials to secure lower prices in exchange for payment guarantees.</p>
<p>It would also petition Russia to close the domestic market to foreign aluminium products and added that Russian rolled aluminium firms would improve if primary producers focused on the domestic market.</p>
<p>"A proposal to the government has been prepared on protectionist measures aiming to close the Russian market to the penetration of imports made from aluminium," it said.</p>
<p>OAO Sayansky Alyuminievy Zavod also said it would try to negotiate long-term freight and electricity price agreements with Russia's railways ministry and Unified Energy System, RAO UES, respectively.</p>
<p>Electricity and transport prices affect the price of primary aluminium, especially among major Russian producers, which are located far from major markets in Siberia.</p>
<p>Sayansk said electricity prices for domestic producers were twice as high as for Western producers.</p>
<p>Sayansk, a primary aluminium producer, also has a foil-making subsidiary, Sayanal, which company leaders have said plans to increase its domestic sales, partly at the expense of imported foreign packaging materials.</p>
