<p>Greek stocks moved to the upside on Thursday on upbeat industrial heavyweights but came off their highs in late trading -- the benchmark index settling 0.89 percent higher on the day.</p>
<p>"The general index will continue to fluctuate within the 1,570-1,630 trading range in the near-term because the market does not have great expectations for a wide deviation of stock prices from current levels," said Michael Dimitropoulos, chief analyst at Eurocorp-Banque Worms.</p>
<p>"Investors do not anticipate to be hit by major market-moving news and this translates into thin trading," he added. "But any positive developments in the macroeconomy will fuel optimism as prices appear very well-based."</p>
<p>Other market watchers said the market offered some very interesting short-term plays in blue chips even though turnover was low.</p>
<p>"The market remains vibrant despite some notable absenteeism during the summer holiday period," said a fund manager.</p>
<p>There are plenty of profitable opportunities around in blue chips such as Hellenic Bottling which oscillate wildly over a horizon of a few days, even during intra-day trading, the fund manager added.</p>
<p>"Greek stocks are attractively priced in relation to drachma interest rates and stock prices in competing emerging markets," said Dimitropoulos.</p>
<p>The Athens general index added 0.89 percent or 14.17 points to 1,598.34 from Wednesday's 1,584.17 close, with an intra-day high set at 1,601.70.</p>
<p>Industrials led the market with a 1.74 percent climb, mostly attributed to Hellenic Bottling's 5.07 percent rise and strong performance in cement stocks.</p>
<p>Turnover picked up to 14.3 billion drachmas on volume of 3.9 million shares, boosted by block trading.</p>
<p>Advancers outpaced decliners 109 to 95 with 26 shares unchanged on 230 traded.</p>
<p>OTE telecom Global Depository Shares (GDS) were quoted on London's SEAQ International market at $10.65-$10.95. Two GDSs make up one share of OTE.</p>
