<text>
<p>European oil swaps were steady to firmer on Monday with Brent CFDs stronger by a few cents close in and weaker further out. Gasoline gained $1 across the board. Fuel and naphtha were unchanged.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs gained a few cents after a shaky start this morning. June 30-July 4 was pegged at -21/22 cents against August Brent from -26 cents on Friday, while July 7-11 was assessed at -27 cents from -28 cents. Further out contracts were a couple of cents easier at -30 cents and -31 cents for July 14-18 and July 21-25 respectively.</p>
<p>July 7-11 was done several times with -25 cents and -29 cents done against August Brent and -37 cents traded against September Brent. A July 7-11/July 14-18 rollover traded at +2 cents.</p>
<p>Heavy fuel oil showed early signs of firmness, but the promise failed to materialise and dealers said July was pegged around $83.50 with July valued 75 cents or so stronger.</p>
<p>Low sulphur swaps saw a July contract trade at $93.625, but overall fuel activity was dullish.</p>
<p>Gasoline tracked screen crude higher and July swaps traded at $186 and $185.50 against a value of $184.50 on Friday. August and September remained resolutely in backwardation of $1.50 apiece.</p>
<p>Naphtha was flat despite the gains on crude and gasoline. Dealers said a wet overhang was affecting the market. July swaps were holding around $173.50 to $174 while August was either side of $177.</p>
