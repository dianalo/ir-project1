<p>A Turkish parliament sub-commission has called for judicial authorities to investigate the handling by security forces of a rebel Kurd protest at a high-security jail in which 10 prisoners died.</p>
<p>"The incident must be passed on for independent judgement," the sub-commission's report, of which Reuters obtained a copy on Monday, said about the jail violence in the southeastern city.</p>
<p>The report on September's protest by members of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) in the Diyarbakir prison in southeast Turkey is to be discussed by parliament's human rights investigation commission on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"It is understood that the intervention was not carried out in accordance with the directive" on dealing with prison protests, the report said.</p>
<p>The "grave results" of the security force intervention could have been avoided if teargas had been used first according to prison directives, it said.</p>
<p>One prisoner told the sub-commission that security officials attacked the inmates with iron bars and wooden clubs.</p>
<p>He said the protest started after prison officials refused to allow the delivery of foodstuffs to one of the dormitories.</p>
<p>Prison official Mahmut Caca, who was dismissed after the incident, told the MP group that security officials used batons, not iron bars, during the hour-long intervention because they had no other way to quell the protest.</p>
<p>Among its recommendations, the report called for a cell system in Turkish prisons to replace the dormitory system.</p>
<p>It added that 942 inmates, the majority associated with the PKK, were still held at Diyarbakir jail, which had an official capacity of 650. More than 21,000 people have been killed since 1984, when the PKK started its battle for Kurdish self-rule in the southeast.</p>
