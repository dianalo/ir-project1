<p>Tens of thousands of Belarussians turned painful memories of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster into an outpouring of anger at their hardline President Alexander Lukashenko on Saturday.</p>
<p>"The nation! Freedom! Down with Luka!" a column of up to 30,000 people chanted as they marched peacefully through the capital of the former Soviet republic worst affected by contamination from the Chernobyl blast.</p>
<p>A year ago dozens of people were hurt when a similar protest erupted in clashes. This year state-controlled media issued warnings not to attend the demonstration organised by Belarus' small but vocal opposition.</p>
<p>An official ceremony attracted a few hundred members of veterans' organisations and others bearing portraits of Lukashenko who gathered earlier to hear speeches by officials and survivors of the clean-up operation at the plant.</p>
<p>"The memory of Chernobyl is a great pain for all of us," said Valentina, 72, crying as she described her worries about her grandson's dizziness and other health problems caused after he went fishing on the day Chernobyl exploded.</p>
<p>When the wind blew across Belarus after the reactor blew up in neighbouring Ukraine 11 years ago it brought an estimated 80 percent of the resulting radiation with it.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of people among the population of 10 million were affected in some way by the disaster, but it was politics that moved the crowd on Saturday.</p>
<p>"Integration is occupation!" read one banner, expressing opposition to Lukashenko's policy of forming a union with Russia.</p>
<p>"We are 100 percent against Lukashenko's politics. We are suffering unbearable pressure at work for our political beliefs. Our neighbours spy on us," said Taisa, 47, who chanted "Long live Belarus!" with her colleague and sister Maria.</p>
<p>"Everyone marching today feels like that. And everyone else is asleep," said a woman marching beside them.</p>
<p>The women, who work at Minsk's tractor factory, were expressing a widespread belief among Lukashenko's opponents that Soviet-style restrictions are still in place more than five years since the Soviet Union fell apart.</p>
<p>Lukashenko, a 42-year-old former farm boss, is actively opposed by a loose union of nationalists, intellectuals, students and prominent politicians mostly concentrated in the capital.</p>
<p>They have staged regular street protests which have sometimes ended in violence and arrests. Saturday's march was much bigger than usual but passed without major incident.</p>
<p>The bulk of the population, wooed by Lukashenko's promises to fight corruption and sharing his nostalgia for the Soviet Union, backed him in a controversial referendum in November which he used to crack down on his opponents.</p>
<p>"I've come to defend democracy," said Sergei, 18, with a red-and-white nationalist band around his head.</p>
<p>At the head of the column of marchers a priest waved an incense burner and two men carried a tolling bell.</p>
<p>Gennady Grushevoy, head of the Children of Chernobyl Fund which channels donations from abroad, said the authorities were hiding the truth of the scale of the disaster. He also said his fund had effectively been frozen because of checks by authorities.</p>
<p>The fund's problems led German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to summon Minsk's ambassador on April 17 to express deep concern at restrictions on humanitarian organisations in Belarus, which have close ties with groups in Germany.</p>
<p>Before the march Lukashenko suggested demonstrators should go and protest in the contaminated zone around Chernobyl.</p>
