<p>Asian markets are ready to shrug off the lethargy of the past two years and make a concerted dash towards recovery, Janice Wallace, executive director at Goldman Sachs in Hong Kong, said on Friday.</p>
<p>Expectations of a turnaround in Asian exports could draw money into the region, possibly at the expense of out-performing stocks in Hong Kong and New York, she said.</p>
<p>"Generally speaking, the last couple of years have not been great for Asian markets and it's been very important to be in the right market," Wallace told Reuters in an interview. "If we get a turnaround in exports then it's not going to matter hugely if you're in Singapore or Indonesia or Philippines or wherever. Sentiment is going to improve everywhere and you're going to see more money moving into these markets."</p>
<p>While Hong Kong and the United States soared to new highs throughout this year, Asian stocks lagged, with shrinking exports contributing to a 30 percent slide in Thailand and Korea.</p>
<p>"As we get to the end of the year, people are going to look at the exports slowdown we've been through and the fact that it should be pretty close to running the course, and they'll say, 'Gosh, we might miss something big here, whereas what are we going to miss in the U.S. -- five to 10 percent maybe'?"</p>
<p>Wallace said investors were already considering switching out of Hong Kong and New York in favour of under-performing stocks throughout Asia, even though a recovery in exports would take time to materialise.</p>
<p>"I don't think (investors) see the export turnaround as imminent," she said. "The trouble is markets don't wait ... These markets are not that liquid ... so I think smart investors will be saying, 'I don't see any downside in Singapore. I just made 20 percent in Hong Kong. I think I'll move my money that way'."</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs said improved exports of semiconductors early in 1997 followed by a mid-year turnaround in exports of dynamic random access memory chips (DRAMS) should generate an average return of 15 percent from Asian equities next year, with Singapore, Indonesia and Korea considered the strongest performers.</p>
<p>Following its stellar performance this year, Hong Kong is expected to consolidate in the near term and could even lose ground if other Asian markets perform in line with forecasts.</p>
<p>Among Asian markets, Singapore equities are expected to make the strongest gains, leaping more than 20 percent next year as semi-conductor exports revive and consumer confidence returns.</p>
<p>"Confidence and sentiment in Singapore have become very negative and we think it's overdone. The market really doesn't have any other problems," Wallace said.</p>
<p>Indonesia and Korea could offer similar returns, although Korea's exposure to DRAMs might delay its recovery. Despite its exposure to semiconductor exports, Thailand's continuing political worries could put a lid on reward, Wallace said.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's a cheap market but I think you'll probably make more money somewhere else," she added.</p>
<p>Expectations of a 100-basis point rise in U.S. rates would take some of the wind out of Asia's sails and prevent a recurrence of 1993, when markets soared as liquidity rushed out of the United States, Wallace said.</p>
