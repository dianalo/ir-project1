<p>Petco Animal Supplies Inc on Thursday said it has completed its acquisition of Pet Food Warehouse Inc, giving Petco a total of 325 stores on February 2 and boosting annual revenues to over $500 million.</p>
<p>"We believe the combination will be accretive to earnings in 1997 and thereafter, and significant opportunities for further expansion will emerge throughout the midwest," Brian Devine, chief executive officer, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the merger, Pet Food shareholders will receive 0.2173913 shares of Petco common for each Pet Food common share they hold.</p>
<p>Petco will issue about 2.0 million shares to complete the deal, bringing its total outstanding shares to 18.6 million.</p>
<p>"(The acquisition) represents an important strategic move consistent with our mission to build shareholder value," Devine said. "Based on the similarity of the companies' product offerings and the fact that there is no geographic overlap of operations, we anticipate a smooth integration of Pet Food Warehouse's stores into PETCO's system."</p>
<p>Based in Minneapolis, Pet Food Warehouse operates pet food and supply stores in Minnesota, Wisconsin, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Iowa.</p>
