<p>World linseed production in 1996/97 (Oct/Sept) was forecast at 2.23 million tonnes, down 14 percent from the 95/96 season, the Oil World newsletter said.</p>
<p>The publication cited lower output in Canada, Argentina and Europe and added this would result in stocks reductions of seed and oil in major producing and importing countries.</p>
<p>Linseed crushings in 96/97 would also be lower at 1.95 million tonnes compared with 1.97 million in 95/96.</p>
<p>As a result, lin oil stocks were expected to fall to 87,000 tonnes, or 13.0 percent of annual use, at the end of 96/97 compared with carry-in stocks at 105,000 tonnes (15.8 percent).</p>
<p>Linseed meal stocks were pegged at 16,000 tonnes at the end of 96/97, down from 19,000 tonnes on Oct 1, 1996.</p>
<p>This was assuming a sharp fall in meal exports to 141,000 tonnes (179,000 in 95/96), including a decline in key exporter Argentina's figure to 57,000 tonnes (104,000 in 95/96).</p>
<p>Oil World said European linseed prices, at $323 for Jan/Feb shipment, were 14 percent above levels seen a year ago and linseed expeller pellets, at $267, were up 26 percent.</p>
