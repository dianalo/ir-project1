<p>India said on Saturday that it was "horrified" by the upsurge of violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip which it blamed on the opening of a tunnel in Jerusalem by Israeli authorities.</p>
<p>"The government of India is deeply concerned at the recent serious incidents of violence in the West Bank and Gaza caused by the action of the Israeli authorities of opening a tunnel," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>More than 50 Palestinians and more than a dozen Israelis have been killed and hundreds have been wounded in violence which erupted after Israel opened an archaeological tunnel near the al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third-holiest shrine.</p>
<p>"We are horrified at the tragic loss of several innocent lives and the large-scale injuries following violent clashes," the ministry said.</p>
<p>India said the situation "underlines the need for immediate and effective measures to end the violence and create a climate which would enable purposeful negotiations, based on a recognition of the underlying causes of the conflict".</p>
<p>The foreign ministry urged "all parties concerned to intensify their efforts towards realising these objectives, keeping in view that durable peace and stability in Middle East requires addressing the Palestinian issue".</p>
<p>On Saturday, Palestinians and Israeli soldiers clashed for a fourth straight day in the West Bank but most of the area remained quiet, witnesses said.</p>
