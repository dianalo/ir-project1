<p>-- BURTON TO CHALLENGE MAIL-ORDER GIANTS</p>
<p>The Burton Group is planning to launch home-shopping catalogues within the next two years for all its high street brands, including Debenhams, Evans, Principles and Top Shop. The expansion is the most adventurous by any major British high street retailer and comes after two mail-order acquisitions by Burton this year. Chief executive John Hoerner said the group now has the skill to handle mail order and argued that the launch of in-house catalogues is designed to capitalise on changes in consumers' lifestyles.</p>
<p>-- CLARKE FIGHTS RETURN TO ERM</p>
<p>Chancellor Kenneth Clarke is to warn Jean Arthuis, his French opposite, that Britain will not accept forced membership of a new exchange rate mechanism after monetary union. The French insist that one will be needed to stop countries outside the single currency securing an unfair advantage by allowing their currencies to devalue against the euro. Britain wants to retain maximum freedom for the pound. Mr Clarke is also expected to register British concern about the way France has relied on a transfer of pension fund money from France Telecom to meet the Maastricht criteria.</p>
<p>-- FOOD AND DRINK EXECUTIVES GET BIGGEST RISES</p>
<p>According to a report published by Monks Partnership, the remuneration advisors, chief executives in the food, drink and tobacco businesses have enjoyed the biggest salary increases in the industrial sector during the past year, and those in the construction sector fared worst. The report shows the rate of rises for directors of industrial and commercial companies over the past year. Also the survey showed that more than 60 percent of main board directors in the biggest companies now have the chance to take part in long-term incentive schemes.</p>
<p>THE TIMES</p>
<p>-- KWIK SAVE TO CLOSE STORES AND CUT STAFF</p>
<p>Due to an expected plunge in full-year pre-tax profits to 90.3 million stg, the discount retailer Kwik Save Group will close 107 stores and shed 1,900 staff. The group has fallen victim to the introduction of basic ranges from the main supermarket chains and competition from European rivals. Chief executive Graeme Bowler said that despite the profit decline the group maintained its dividend payout because it had a strong cashflow and balance sheet.</p>
<p>-- RATE FEAR PUSHES MARKET LOWER</p>
<p>Government securities and equities suffered a hefty fall, pointing towards the prospect of another rise in interest rates in the stock market. The 95-point rise by the Dow Jones industrial average on Wall Street failed to have much impact in London where an early 17-point lead by the FT-SE 100 index was quickly reversed. Investors in London chose to concentrate Wednesday's call by the Bank of England for anther rise in interest rates. Government securities have been hit hard by the move to dearer money.</p>
<p>-- STAKE IN CHELSEA VILLAGE MAY BE SOLD AFTER DISPUTE</p>
<p>The resignation of former Lloyd's of London chief executive Peter Middleton has led trustees of the Matthew Harding estate to sell his 25 percent stake in Chelsea Village, owner of the Premiership football club Chelsea. Mr Middleton was described by advisors as representing Mr Harding's interests on the Chelsea board. He heads the European operation of Salomon Brothers. Chelsea's company secretary Alan Shaw said Mr Middleton's departure would not change the club's plans for the ground.</p>
<p>THE GUARDIAN</p>
<p>-- BRITISH RAIL  BR.L KILLED OFF RAIL FREIGHT</p>
<p>In a letter to 8,000 staff, Ed Burkhardt, chief executive of the newly privatised rail freight industry, has ordered cost cuts to offset British Rail's years of "greed in pricing". He admits to the continuing frailty of his business and that it will have to reduce costs to stay solvent. Rail union leaders say they fear job cuts, even though Mr Burkhardt congratulates staff on the way they have responded to the new regime.</p>
<p>-- LANG ACTS TO STEM OFFSHORE TIDE</p>
<p>The Government has acted to halt the threatened exodus from Britain of top professional firms that are furious that they have to foot legal bills when companies go bust. Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang is under increasing pressure from leading accountancy, legal and other professional bodies following claims for billions of pounds stg against firms over collapses, such as BCCI.</p>
<p>-- EC WANTS MORE DETAILS BEFORE DECIDING BRITISH TELECOM DEAL</p>
<p>Karel Van Miert, European competition commissioner, is seeking further information from companies about the size of their turnover in Europe before deciding how to scrutinise British Telecom's 12 billion stg bid for MCI. The companies would prefer the bid to be examined under the EC's fast track merger rules rather than under the broader concerted practices and fair trading regulations. A decision is expected in the next few days.</p>
<p>THE INDEPENDENT</p>
<p>-- DOMINION RESOURCES TO DECIDE ON EAST MIDLANDS TAKEOVER BID</p>
<p>The board of US utility group Dominion, which is considering a takeover bid for East Midlands Electricity, is to decide whether to press ahead with a formal offer. East Midland's share price was pushed down by profit-taking and mounting fears the bid would be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. City analysts say the company would have to pay around 670 pence a share for a bid to be successful.</p>
<p>-- BA MAY HAVE TO GIVE UP A THIRD OF HEATHROW SLOTS</p>
<p>The European Commission is demanding that British Airways give up a third of its slots on US routes from Heathrow airport as a condition for approving its proposed alliance with American Airlines. UK regulatory approval for the merger could be delayed until mid-December. Both airlines oppose the conditions, which may be tougher than those recommended by the UK watchdog Office of Fair Trading.</p>
<p>-- BOOTS SHRUGS OFF PRICE-FIXING MOVE</p>
<p>Boots have defused worries that the Office of Fair Trading's recent challenge to retail price maintenance in non-prescription drugs might lead to a price war. Chairman Sir Michael Angus said the decision to refer the price-fixing arrangement to the Restrictive Practices Court was disappointing, but Boots the Chemists was well placed whatever its conclusion. He said that retail maintenance on over-the-counter medicines should remain in force because consumer interests are best served by retaining the services that pharmacists provide in local communities.</p>
