<p>Belgian police hunting for a serial killer after finding the butchered remains of four caucasian women stuffed into plastic bin bags, issued six identikit pictures on Wednesday of people they want to question.</p>
<p>Justice sources told Belgian media they were working on the theory that the mutilated body of a fifth woman found in the same area last July was the work of the same killer.</p>
<p>The Mons public prosecutor's office said two of the pictures were related to the July killing and the four others with the recent finds. They were possible witnesses, not currently suspects, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>The nine bags containing the surgically severed limbs of three women were found by chance at the weekend by a passing mounted policeman in a ditch near the Brussels to Paris rail line in the town of Cuesmes near the southern city of Mons.</p>
<p>The torso of a fourth woman was found nearby on Monday. Police said the woman had been killed within the past two weeks.</p>
<p>They said the bag containing the torso had been left near the Mons administrative centre while police were swarming over the area after finding the bags containing the remains of the three other women.</p>
<p>Investigators still have no clear leads on the motives for the multiple murders, the identity of the four latest victims or the killer.</p>
<p>A man who was held by police on Monday in connection with the murders has been effectively ruled out of the picture. He has been in a coma for a week after taking a drugs overdose.</p>
<p>"At the moment we have no objective evidence that allows us to follow up this lead," Mons Public Prosecutor Pierre Honore said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>All the remains have been transferred to Liege University hospital where forensic pathologists are trying to piece together the anatomical jigsaw.</p>
<p>Honore warned that identification of the victims could take up to two weeks.</p>
<p>Police said it was clear from the state of the ground under the bags containing the severed limbs that they had been left in the ditch at different times over a two-year period.</p>
<p>Five of the nine bags found at the weekend had the name of the Belgian beach resort of Knokke-Heist printed on them -- although those bags are also sold in Mons.</p>
<p>Police said the investigation into the origin of the limbs and the torso would focus on recent disappearances of women in Belgium, France and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>They said there was no immediate reason to suspect a link with gruesome discoveries made in a paedophile scandal which has rocked the country in the past nine months.</p>
<p>The bodies of five young girls have been found since August.</p>
<p>Convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux has been charged with the murder of four of them. Another convicted paedophile, Patrick Derochette, has been charged with the illegal imprisonment and rape of a minor leading to death.</p>
