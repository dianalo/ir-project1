<p>Overnight Cetes rates closed a scant 25 basis points down on Monday at 23 percent after a dull session in which foreign dealers were absent.</p>
<p>"There were few trades as U.S. markets were closed today, and they're the ones that move the market. Most trades were in overnight paper as the term market was almost dead," a trader said.</p>
<p>U.S. markets were closed on Monday due to the Labor day holiday.</p>
<p>Bids of 25 percent were made for 28-day Cetes, but no trades were settled. Meanwhile, 91-day and 182-day paper closed at 29.02 and 31.30 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>"Bids were high for term paper, as traders are expecting hikes of 100-125 basis points at the (primary) auction," a dealer said.</p>
<p>A heavy shortfall caused the central bank to inject more liquidity than usual, by auctioning 6.463 billion pesos in credits.</p>
<p>Some traders felt that investor reaction to President Ernesto Zedillo's state of the nation speech on Sunday will be felt on Tuesday, when U.S. markets are open again after the holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The market is expected to be livelier and more speculatve on Tuesday with overnight Cetes rates at 23.50 percent. A liquidity shortfall of 4.7 billion pesos is expected.</p>
