<p>Share prices on the Delhi bourse closed higher on Tuesday as investors returned to the market amid anticipation that the minimum alternate tax (MAT) on companies would be abolished, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Delhi Stock Exchange's sensitive index closed 6.02 points higher at 667.77.  </p>
<p>"Some favourable steps by the Finance Ministry enthused investors and helped push share prices higher," said Sanjay Mittal of brokers S.R.M. Securities.</p>
<p>Mittal added :"The sudden change in market's behaviour forced speculators to cover their short positions."</p>
<p>Earlier on Sunday Finance Minister P. Chidambaram was quoted as saying there might be reason for MAT to "disappear" after company tax and income tax laws had been redrafted.</p>
<p>Industry has complained that MAT has eroded some companies' profits.</p>
<p>Brokers said the government's move to drop a proposal for the issue of non-voting shares also helped buoy market sentiment.</p>
<p>The Economic Times newspaper on Tuesday reported that the government had dropped its plan to allow companies to issue non-voting shares.</p>
<p>ACC rose 34.50 rupees to 1,129.50 rupees on foreign buying, brokers said.</p>
<p>Reliance Industries traded in alternate bouts of buying and selling before settling down at 194.65 rupees, 1.30 rupee higher.</p>
<p>TISCO edged up 0.50 rupee to 159.</p>
<p>TELCO firmed 9.40 rupees to 342.40.</p>
