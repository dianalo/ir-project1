<p>Four Bosnian Serbs indicted for atrocities at detention camps in northwest Bosnia are now working openly as police officers in the area, an international official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We have sent letters. We have spoken to the leadership in Pale on the subject," Colum Murphy, spokesman for the office of international High Representative to Bosnia, Carl Bildt, told reporters.</p>
<p>"We have made demands and we've insisted that they not play any substantive role in future operations."</p>
<p>The four were identified as Mladen Radic, Miroslav Kvocka, Nedjelko Timarac and Zeljko Mejakic.</p>
<p>A U.N. reported dated Oct 27 said they were serving as police officers in the Serb-controlled Prijedor area, where more than 90 abandoned Moslem houses and two mosques were blown up last week.</p>
<p>The U.N. war crimes tribunal at The Hague has indicted Radic and Kvocko for crimes against civilian prisoners at Omarska detention camp near Prijedor and it has indicted Timarac for crimes at Keraterm camp, also near Prijedor.</p>
<p>Mejakic, whose picture appears on a war criminals poster, is believed to have been one of the commanders of Omarska camp and currently works at Omarska police station, 30 km (20 miles) east of Prijedor.</p>
<p>Some of the Bosnian war's worst atrocities took place in the Prijedor area in 1992, where hundreds of non-Serb men are believed to have been kept and tortured at detention centres.</p>
<p>The Hague tribunal has indicted 75 suspects, most of them Serbs, but only seven of them are in its custoy.</p>
<p>NATO said its peacekeeping troops had not reported encountering the three policemen.</p>
<p>Murphy initially reported only three suspects to be working as police officers. The U.N. report, faxed to Reuters, reveals a fourth war crimes suspect serving in the same area.</p>
