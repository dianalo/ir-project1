<p>Nigerian shares slipped further on Friday  and dealers said they didn't expect a swift upturn from the current  slide.</p>
<p>The all-share index closed at 8133.93 from 8148.80 on Thursday.</p>
<p>The index is down over 2.3 percent in the past week and has fallen  7.6 percent since share prices began to slip in late April.</p>
<p>"If in the off season we have seen prices falling, the trend is likely  continue to the end of the year," analyst Tunde Ayeni of CSL Stockbrokers  said.</p>
<p>Some dealers still pin hopes of recovery on the release of capital  spending funds by the military government, seven months after they  were due.</p>
<p>But pessimists say that small investors, who traditionally account  for a high proportion of shares traded on the stock exchange, tend  to need to realise assets towards the end of the year.</p>
