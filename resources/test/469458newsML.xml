<p>Emergency workers on Wednesday raced to divert floodwaters surging down the Mississippi River, which was expected to crest over the weekend at the highest levels in more than 50 years.</p>
<p>By the end of the day, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers expected to open 298 out of 350 bays along the Bonnet Carre Spillway upriver from New Orleans to calm rushing currents and protect levees straining to hold back the rising waters.</p>
<p>"We have some flooding in areas outside of the levees, but in terms of the kinds of flooding, this is not a 1927 flood, grace of God," Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Rob Brown said. "The good news is that, as opposed to 1927, we've got levies," he said, referring to the worst flood in Louisiana this century.</p>
<p>In Baton Rouge, hundreds of state employees left work early and schools were closed after people there complained of a noxious odour coming off the river near where a barge capsized nine days ago with a load of benzene-laden gasoline.</p>
<p>Officials said air quality tests from sampling stations set up around the barge detected negligible benzene levels -- about 0.45 parts per million -- in downtown and no benzene coming out of the capsized barge.</p>
<p>"You could pump gas at a gas station and your reading right there at the pump is probably one part per million," said Baton Rouge Fire Department spokesman Danny Pickering. He said crews were still searching for the source of the odour.</p>
<p>The river was flowing at 43.6 feet (13.29 metres) past Baton Rouge and was expected to crest at 44 feet (13.41 metres) here on Saturday, the height of the levee protecting downtown. Sandbags have been piled three feet (1 metre) high along that stretch to hold back the torrent.</p>
<p>Fed by heavy spring rains upriver, the Mississippi was flowing at 2.3 million cubic feet (65,130 cu metres) per second upstream from New Orleans, but the flow was expected to ease to 2.1 million cubic feet (59,460 cu metres) per second at the crest.</p>
<p>"We're just treading water," Brown said. "The water just keeps coming at us."</p>
