<p>Germany's DAX index, which stumbled on Friday on profit-taking ahead of the weekend, appears set to remain under pressure in the near-term.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index ended down 30.78 at 4,196.53 points and extended losses in post-bourse IBIS computer dealings to trade down 25.04 points at 4,178.87 points.</p>
<p>Despite the losses, the DAX rose about four percent over the week, rising about 156 points from last Friday's close.</p>
<p>"I think the market looks a bit tired," said one dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers looked for the blue-chip index to find support at about 4,155 to 4,160 points on any pull-back.  </p>
<p>They said the losses would be constructive for the market to post further gains and reach new record levels.</p>
<p>Some of Friday's losses were tied to the expiry of the DAX options amid signs of heavy open interest at 4,200 points.</p>
<p>Overnight losses on Wall Street and losses in German debt markets, worried about the possible risk of a Bundesbank rate hike to help the mark, also capped market interest.</p>
<p>The market showed little reaction to the June Ifo business climate index report for west Germany, which rose beyond market expectations in June to 96.0 from a revised 95.4 in May.  </p>
<p>In east Germany, the climate reading eased back slightly with the index at 103.6 from an upward revised 103.7 in May.</p>
<p>Despite the general downward trend, banking stocks were in the focus after Commerzbank AG predicted many banks will report double-digit growth in first-half operating profit.</p>
<p>The report also said banking shares may also get a boost from speculation for mergers in the industry due to recent consolidation in the insurance sector.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank AG, which will report results on July 23, reached a new record high at 109.20 marks and ended bourse trade up 108.70 marks.  </p>
<p>Bayerische Hypo rose 72 pfennigs to 58.50 marks and Dresdner Bank AG rose 65 pfennigs to 74.65 marks.</p>
<p>But Commerzbank fell 40 pfennigs to 53.80 marks.</p>
<p>Retailer Karstadt AG, which had surged more than 100 marks this week on takeover speculation, slumped on Friday to end bourse trade down 24 marks at 670 marks.</p>
<p>Other notable shares posting losses that outpaced the market were carmaker Volkswagen AG, which fell 37 marks to 1,403 marks, and chemicals group Degussa AG, which fell 2.93 marks to 93.50 marks in bourse dealings.</p>
