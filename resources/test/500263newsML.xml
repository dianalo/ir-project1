<p>Rains have brought relief to parts of Algeria which has set up a task force to battle drought threatening crops, the official Algerian news agency APS said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"While it is still too soon to make an evaluation of the yield levels for cereals, experts from the agriculture ministry indicate that overall the cereal zones of the country have been saved by the return of the rain," the agency said.</p>
<p>It said fine rains had fallen for four days on the whole of the Sahel zones and high plateau which had brought hope both to farmers and ordinary people facing water problems.</p>
<p>The meteorological services said rain was expected to continue falling on all the northern half of the country until Saturday, APS said.</p>
<p>Last Monday, the government newspaper El Moudjahid said water supplies for main cities like the capital Algiers, and Oran and Constantine, had reached a critical level. Rainfall coinciding with the most sensitive growing period for cereals and other crops was 70 percent below average, according to a ministerial report.</p>
<p>Harvesting in southern Algeria usually starts in late May and in late June in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>"The return of the rainfall...is going to have a certain beneficial effect on cereal growing, particularly for areas where seeding was carried out late," said APS.</p>
<p>Algeria had a record harvest of 4.9 million tonnes of cereals in the 1995-96 season, compared with 2.13 million tonnes in the 1994-95 season.</p>
