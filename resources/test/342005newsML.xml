<p>The New York State Senate, which rejected casino gambling, on Tuesday predicted the issue would arise again although residents, whose approval would be needed, would not be asked to vote on a new plan before 1999.</p>
<p>The bill, which was fought by some competing casinos in Atlantic City, N.J., and Connecticut, and religious and environmental groups, was defeated by a margin of 41 to 19.</p>
<p>The Senate's Republican leadership needed the votes of the minority Democrats to secure the bill's approval, but evidently was not willing to make the trade-offs needed to get their support in light of the divisions among its own members.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, R-Troy, at an Albany news conference, said that he told his members to vote as they believed best after it became clear that most Democrats would oppose the bill.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Martin Connor, D-Manhattan, said that the casino bill was defeated for its substantive flaws.</p>
<p>"The lack of specific plans for guarding against organized crime, for regulating the gaming industry, and for distributing tax monies, clearly played a role in the strong negative vote," he said in prepared remarks.</p>
<p>New York City fought the measure because it would not have let riverboats cruise around Manhattan. Bruno, who said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani initially had asked that the bill exclude the city, said he again would defer to the Assembly Speaker, Sheldon Silver, D-Manhattan on the issue.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for Giuliani and Silver were not immediately available.</p>
<p>Giuliani's hand was forced when Bay Cruises in mid-December began running a gambling cruise ship that sailed from Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, to international waters.</p>
<p>The Guiliani Administration reached a pact with the company to tax its proceeds and screen its employees to ensure organized crime did not gain a toehold. The City Council and mayor are working on rules to cover the issue.</p>
<p>Gov George Pataki has said he supported the state casino measure, as allowing out-of-state and Native American casinos inside New York to capture the business was costing the state billions of dollars.</p>
<p>State sources, who declined to be named, speculated that the absence of a stronger push by Pataki to secure the measure's approval suggested he might be waiting to see how the federal government elects to treat casinos run by Native Americans.</p>
<p>New York's Oneida tribe runs a casino that it set-up under a compact reached with the former Cuomo Administration.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Gov Pataki was not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>The Senate Majority Leader predicted that the issue of letting in casinos will resurface, noting that the state ranks second on the list of states that send residents to such resorts. "Now that's pretty telling, so when you say will this issue go away, no, it won't go away."</p>
<p>Bruno suggested contributions from lobbyists had influenced votes but defended the practice.</p>
<p>"Well, the apparent result would indicate that somebody had some success, because I thought that there would be more support in the senate for taking this to a referendum to the people," he said, when asked if real estate tycoon Donald Trump's contributions had had an impact.</p>
<p>Trump, who owns the Taj Mahal casino resort in Atlantic City, N.J., in 1996 spent $855,750 to fight the measure and had signed contracts to spend at least that sum in 1997, the New York Times said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Senate leader added he doubted that legislators will wish to debate a casino bill when they are up for re-election in 1998, when Pataki also will be running, and all but ruled out the possibility the same resolution would be enacted.</p>
<p>"That's not going to happen," Bruno said. He added that the Senate was prepared to consider a revised proposal either this year or next year, though the earliest such a bill could be submitted to the voters would be in 1999.</p>
