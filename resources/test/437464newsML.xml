<p>Artists from Western and Eastern cultures will mix music, poetry and paintings at an exhibition in Morocco's red-walled city of Marrakesh on Saturday, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>About 30 artists from Italy, the United States, India, China, France, Iran, Algeria, Argentinia, Morocco and other countries will show their work inside the six-centuries-old Ibn Youssef Koranic university campus, they said.</p>
<p>"The organisers of Meditations have been inspired by the university framework and invited the artists temporarily to take over university rooms to convert them into space for meditation," said the Swiss-based Art for the World organisation, one of the sponsors of the exhibition organised under the patronage of King Hassan.</p>
<p>Nine poets from France, Egypt, Mexico, Romania, Tunisia and the United States and seven musicians will be there to "generate sensory balances between the various art expressions", they said.</p>
<p>The exhibition will last three days.</p>
