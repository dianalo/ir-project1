<p>Swedish investment company Skanska on Friday denied market talk that it was involved in a bid by Danish builder Marius Pedersen for Danish roadbuilder Phoenix Contractors.</p>
<p>Pedersen on Thursday made the highest of three bids for Phoenix but is seen as lacking the financial muscle to close the deal itself, leading to rumours that Skanska stood in the wings.</p>
<p>"We have not bid for the company, either through Marius Pedersen nor through our subsidiary C.G.Jensen," Skanska spokesman Lennart Hallberg told Reuters.</p>
