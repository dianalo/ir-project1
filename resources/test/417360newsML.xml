<headline>Croatian stocks mixed, prices to stagnate.</headline>
<dateline>ZAGREB 1997-03-04</dateline>

<p>Croatian stocks were mixed in active trade on Tuesday but market participants predicted a period of stagnation for most issues as large investors stayed away from the market.</p>
<p>Traders said weaker demand was due to a constellation of factors, among other the latest unrest in the neigbouring Bosnia where one man was killed and some 20 wounded in an incident in the southern town of Mostar three weeks ago.</p>
<p>"Investors in all new countries are more concerned with political risks than with prospects of firms they are interested in," said Marko Nikolac of Metroholding brokerage.</p>
<p>He said the fact that Croatia is a month away from  regional elections could also contribute to poorer trading.</p>
<p>Five of 14 active issues rose, two were flat and seven fell. Share volume rose to 10,016 from 7,114 shares, turnover was also slightly higher at 4.8 million kuna.</p>
<p>Nikolac singled out Dalmatinska and Varazdinska Banka as possible future gainers "amid rumours the two are soon to be fully-listed (on the Zagreb Stock Exchange)".</p>
<p>Dalmatinska lost 15 kuna to 485 on volume of 895 units. Varazdinska was not active.</p>
<p>Electrical manufacturer Koncar stole the spotlight on Tuesday, rising 1,090 kuna to 1,460, with only 78 shares sold in a first and only transaction since last November.</p>
<p>Traders said the stock could grow, boosted by recent news about its flotation abroad.</p>
<p>"But it remains yet to be seen how Koncar would behave. At the moment there are no selling nor buying orders for its shares," Nikolac said.</p>
<p>Fully-listed Zagrebacka Banka inched down six kuna to 1,714, selling 402 shares. Drugs firm Pliva traded flat at 460 kuna but was among most active issues with 1,041 units sold.</p>
<p>Traders said the two were affected by their London prices which dipped due to a stronger dollar.</p>
<p>Biggest decliner hotelier Istraturist lost 15 kuna to 205 on volume of 38 shares. Jadranturist lost four kuna to 310 and Laguna was flat at 1,400 kuna. Two other hoteliers, Riviera and Suncani Hvar both added one kuna to 180 and 68, respectively.</p>
<p>Most active stock food processor Podravka sold 3,889 shares, inching down five kuna to 305.</p>
<p>Chocolate maker Kras gained 40 kuna to 515, trading 1,095 shares.</p>
<p>The second tranche of public debt refinancing bonds traded at 12.14 percent above face value, up from 10 percent in February. The total turnover for the first and second trancheS was 437.7 million kuna.</p>
