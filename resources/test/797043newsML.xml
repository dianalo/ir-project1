<p>Indian stocks are expected to overcome disappointment after the market regulator failed to take a widely expected decision to introduce an easier carry-forward system, brokers and analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The market is slightly hesitant, lacking strength, but stocks should get over the disappointment," said Sanjay Vaid, chief dealer at Lloyds Securities.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) benchmark index was down 28.37 points, or 0.64 percent, to 4,396.66 shortly after start after tumbling slightly over one percent Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I don't really see it as a major factor for the market, but it's just that lot of players had build up lot of positions in anticipation of the SEBI decision," said Piyush Vora, a member-broker of the BSE.</p>
<p>India capital market regulator, the Securities &amp; Exchange Board of India (SEBI) on Tuesday said it had deferred a proposal to modify the system of carry-forward trade due to lack of time.</p>
<p>"The issue will be taken up at the board's meeting at Madras on September 5," D.R. Mehta, SEBI chairman told a news conference.</p>
<p>SEBI was expected to liberalise a strict carry-forward trading system and help ease restrictions on transactions and increase the funding limit. The market regulator said it had cleared other proposed amendments at the board meeting.</p>
<p>A committee appointed by the market regulator said in July that it had recommended an easier carry-forward system that will abolish twin-track system of segregating carry-forward trades and delivery trades, elimination of a limit of 90 days for transactions and a 100-million-rupee limit on funding.</p>
<p>"I would say that it will provide a reason for operators to play on the market till the next SEBI meeting," said the head of dealing at a foreign brokerage.</p>
<p>Stock markets which went through a roller-coaster ride on Tuesday amid speculation over SEBI's decision will probably see a minor correction in the short-run, but shrug off the disappointment and focus on other factors, dealers said.</p>
<p>A meeting of the ruling United Front coalition's decision making Steering Committee later on Wednesday to consider proposals for reducing the burgeoning cost of subsidies on petroleum products will be keenly watched by the market.</p>
<p>However, dealers said they were not very hopeful of a decision on the price hike which has been repeatedly put off by the government due to resitance from alliance partners.</p>
<p>"One of the three issues slated for discussion at the Steering Committee is the petroleum price hike," said a coalition leader, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>The 15-party United Front need to take a decision on how to tackle a 155 billion rupee ($4.34 billion) debt it owes state-run oil companies.</p>
<p>The outstandings are the cumulative amount the government owes to the firms for selling the products at less than production costs.</p>
