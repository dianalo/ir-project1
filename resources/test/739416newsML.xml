<p>The European Court of Justice stated on Thursday that ARO Lease, a car leasing concern with a fixed establishment in the Netherlands, should not be taxed in Belgium for services provided there through intermediaries.</p>
<p>Since the VAT directive instructs member states to tax services in the place of a business's fixed establishment, the court found that Belgium could not tax ARO for leasing services which were performed through independent intermediaries in Belgium, even though the cars were registered in Belgium.</p>
<p>"The place where the supplier has established his business is a primary point of reference inasmuch as there is no purpose in referring to another establishment from which the services are supplied unless reference to the main place of business does not lead to a rational result for tax purposes or creates a conflict with another member state," the court said.</p>
<p>In deciding the Dutch company ARO had no fixed establishment and therefore no tax liability in Belgium, the court took note of the following facts: the leasing arrangements in Belgium were handled by independent intermediaries; the customers chose their cars from dealers in Belgium; the Dutch company acquired the cars in Belgium, where they are registered; the leasing contracts were drawn up and signed in the Netherlands; the customers pay maintenance and road tax in Belgium, the Dutch company has no office or any storage facility in Belgium.</p>

<p>On a proper construction of article 9(1) of Sixth Council directive 77/388/EEC on the harmonization of the laws of the member states relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment, a leasing company established in one member state does not supply services from a fixed establishment in another member state if it makes passenger cars available in the second state under leasing agreements to customers established there, if its customers have entered into contact with it through self-employed intermediaries established in the second state, if they have chosen their cars from dealers established in the second state, if the leasing company has acquired the cars in the second state, in which they are registered, and has made them available to its customers under leasing agreements drawn up and signed at its main place of business, and if the customers bear maintenance costs and pay road tax in the second state, but the leasing company does not have an office or any pre</p>
