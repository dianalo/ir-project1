<p>Singapore Refining Company (SRC) has shut its 60,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) crude distillation unit for a one-week unscheduled maintenance starting October 1, sources said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Repairs work are ongoing at the moment and the refinery hopes to restart operations by the weekend, the sources said.</p>
<p>They said the crude unit had run some crude supplies that did not meet the refinery's required specification causing technical problems.</p>
<p>When the problems started, the unit was running under its normal operating rate, the sources said.</p>
<p>This forced the refinery to shut the unit for inspection and repairs, they said.  </p>
<p>The refinery located at Singapore's south-western island of Pulau Merlimau has a total capacity of 285,000 bpd.</p>
<p>It is 40 percent owned by Singapore Petroleum Company with the remaining stakes divided equally between British Petroleum and Caltex.</p>
<p>Caltex is a joint venture between Texaco Inc and Chevron Corp.</p>
