<p>0315 GMT	     TRADED HIGH/LOW AS OF 0300 GMT</p>
<p> USD/JPY     116.10/18		   116.25-115.95</p>
<p> USD/DEM     1.8338/41		   1.8367-1.8331</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The dollar maintained its firm tone at Tokyo midday on Friday, continuing its recent bullish trend, but the market lacked fresh incentives for the greenback to rise further against the yen and the mark, dealers said.</p>
<p>Scattered offers by Japanese exporters at around 116.30-116.50 yen capped the dollar/yen rate, while bids by trust banks supported the dollar, they said.  </p>
<p>"The dollar was a bit firmer, but it lacked direction and was very dull. The market was reluctant to take new positions amid a lack of fresh news," a Japanese trust bank dealer said.</p>
<p>"Position adjustment is expected to be dominant until the start of the European market," he said.</p>
<p>Speculative buying by trading firms and commercial buying pushed up the greenback in early trade, but the upward trend was shortlived as buying interest shrank after offers by Japanese exporters were seen on the upside, dealers said.</p>
<p>Although trade was quiet this morning, dealers expect the greenback to test its upside in the near term.  </p>
<p>A European bank dealer said Japanese trust banks have demand for dollars against the yen.</p>
<p>"The dollar could rise towards 117 yen if the trust banks start buying," the dealer said.</p>
<p>The dollar/mark firmed slightly on purchases by U.S. fund operators, but follow-through activity was limited.</p>
<p>The greenback soared to a high of 1.8400 marks in European trade on Thursday as players expressed relief that the German central bank had not switched from a fixed to a variable repo rate as some had speculated.  </p>
<p>On Thursday, the dollar hit a high of 1.51 Swiss francs, its highest level since November 1993, while heavy sales of Swiss francs for marks by U.S. funds and banks pushed the mark/Swiss franc rate up to 0.8215 from a low of 0.8090.</p>
<p>"The Swiss franc plunged overnight, driven by heavy long liquidation and technical sales, but the franc was resting in Tokyo," another European bank dealer said.</p>
<p>At 0343 GMT the dollar stood at 1.5060/70 Swiss francs, compared with 1.5053/63 in New York overnight.</p>
<p>The dollar closed at 116.05/15 yen and 1.8322/32 marks in New York on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The mark stood at 63.30/33 yen at midday, little changed from 63.35 yen in New York.</p>
<p>Dealers said selling orders by Japanese exporters were lined up around 63.50 yen, which capped the upside of the German currency throughout the morning.</p>
