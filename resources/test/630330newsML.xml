<p>Hungarian commercial  corporate lending and deposit rates continued to decline in April despite a National Bank of Hungary (NBH) interest rate hike at the end of March.</p>
<p>"The trend of interest rate decline, beginning in the summer of 1995, did not change in April," the NBH said in a statement on Monday.</p>
<p>The NBH said that the average interest rate of commercial bank loans to enterprises, maturing within one year, dropped in April 0.1 percentage point to 22.3 percent.</p>
<p>As the interest rates of enterprise deposits with maximum one year maturity eased by 0.4 percent to 17.8 percent, the average interest rate margin narrowed by 0.3 percentage points to 4.5 percent, the NBH said.</p>
<p>These interest rates have dropped since the middle of 1995 from a high of above 33 percent for loans and almost 26 percent for deposits.</p>
<p>Year-on-year consumer inflation has seen almost monthly falls from its peak of 31 percent in June 1995, and ran at 18.6 percent in April 1997.</p>
<p>The average interest rate on interbank overnight and tomorrow-next dealings dropped in April by one percentage point to 21 percent, the NBH said.</p>
<p>In March, the NBH raised its six-month deposit rate by 0.25 percent to 21 percent, to protect savings following a rapid decline of interest rates in the first months of the year.</p>
<p>The measure either stabilised or slightly pushed up government securities yields but commercial bank interest rates continued to drop.</p>
<p>The managers of several commercial banks which held annual meetings recently said that competition for corporate and retail customers was increasing, which led to narrowing interest rate margins.</p>
