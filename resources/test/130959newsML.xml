<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats called on Monday for the Church of Scientology in Germany to be put under official surveillance and its members to be barred from public service.</p>
<p>Stepping up a trans-Atlantic dispute with the U.S.-based group, the party called in a tough resolution at its annual congress for a country-wide information network to track the church's activities and advise Germans about it.</p>
<p>The resolution also called for more protection, legal advice and emergency financial help for would-be Scientology dropouts, whom it said the church put "under massive psychic, economic and legal pressure" to keep them in the group.</p>
<p>Scientology last week blasted recent moves to limit its activities in Germany, saying in an advertisement in the New York Times that Bonn used Nazi-style tactics against it.</p>
<p>Bonn rejected that charge as absurd and said it insulted the millions of Jewish victims of the Nazi Holocaust.</p>
<p>"We urge the interior ministry to have the Office for the Protection of the Constitution observe the Scientology organisation," the resolution said, referring to Bonn's agency for counter-intelligence and anti-radical investigations.</p>
<p>"Membership in the Scientology organisation is not compatible with employment in the public service...especially in the security services, with teachers or other instructors," added the resolution, which was not binding on Kohl but reflected a widely-held view in his party.</p>
<p>Scientology, founded in 1954 by American science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, gives would-be members personality tests and then offers courses and literature to help them realise what the church sees as their full potential.</p>
<p>In Germany, which has stricter regulations on church status than the United States and has refused to register Scientology as a religion, some officials see it as a totalitarian group using manipulative practices for profit.</p>
<p>Because of its own Nazi past, Germany tends to take a tough stand on groups it thinks threaten its postwar democracy.</p>
<p>The CDU's youth wing called earlier this year for a boycott of the Hollywood blockbuster "Mission:Impossible" because it stars Tom Cruise -- one of several high-profile Scientologists.</p>
<p>Fellow film stars Nicole Kidman, who is also Cruise's wife, and John Travolta are also members of the church.</p>
<p>According to the CDU's working group on domestic policy, Scientology drew up a plan called "Clear Germany" in the 1980s "to infiltrate the economy, the social system and politics in Germany" and merge the government in a world government known as "International City."</p>
<p>The group denies the charge.</p>
<p>Scientology's New York Times advertisement, headlined "Practising Religious Intolerance" and "Germany Then and Now", bore the eagle and swastika insignia of Hitler's Third Reich.</p>
<p>The advertisement described Germany as the only country systematically discriminating against Scientologists.</p>
<p>"You may wonder why German officials discriminate against Scientologists," it said. "There is no legitimate reason but then there was none that justified the persecution of the Jewish people either."</p>
<p>The controversial ad also drew fire from the U.S. State Department, which has sometimes backed Scientology's grievances against German authorities but said this attack was outrageous.</p>
