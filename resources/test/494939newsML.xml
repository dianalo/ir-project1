<p>Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD) said on Tuesday that talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his coalition government on tax reform would resume next week.</p>
<p>The new round of talks, to be held on April 15 at 1000 GMT, come after the SPD walked out of earlier efforts to reach a compromise on a government tax reform plan that would cut income and corporate tax by 30 billion marks over the next two years.  </p>
<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl this week opened the door to a resumption of cross-party talks on tax reforms aimed at tackling record post-war unemployment and getting state finances into shape for Europe's single currency.</p>
<p>Buoyed by the momentum he gained by announcing last week he would stand for a record fifth term next year, Kohl ended weeks of shadow-boxing by saying he was ready personally to join a new round of talks with the SPD.</p>
<p>SPD spokeswoman Dagmar Wiebusch said talks would be attended by party chairman Oskar Lafontaine, parliamentary leader Rudolf Scharping, finance expert Ingrid Mattheaus-Meyer, Hamburg mayor Henning Voscherau, North Rhine-Westphalia state finance minister Heinz Schleusser and Brandenburg premier Manfred Stolpe.</p>
<p>The SPD walked out of previous talks in protest at separate government plans to cut coal subsidies and has since refused to resume talks with Finance Minister Theo Waigel, who it accuses of leaving a 50 billion mark gap in his fiscal sums which would throw into doubt Germany's compliance with the borrowing requirements of European monetary union (EMU).</p>
