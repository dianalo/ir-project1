<p>Delighted with the reception of its 10-year 500 million mark bond on Tuesday, Brazil expects to carry on setting benchmarks, diversifying its issues and making a name for itself abroad, said a Central Bank director.</p>
<p>"You can expect more of the same. That's the business of consistency," Gustavo Franco, Central Bank Director of International Affairs, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Brazil rushed to place its mark bond while conditions were favourable and was rewarded with a better-than-expected launch price of 230 basis points above the equivalent German Bund.</p>
<p>Franco said he was "very satisfied with the very aggressive spread", especially as the Brazilian bond had to compete with a larger Mexican issue the same day.</p>
<p>The issue was a continuation of six recent launches.</p>
<p>"Brazil...does not really have a financing programme as in the cases of Mexico and Argentina," Franco said. "In our case they are operations aimed at extending the maturities of our debt and diversifying our markets, the modalities."</p>
<p>He added, "It is a continuation of our desire to diversify and use issues to bring Brazil to the attention of the international community, much more than for the money itself."</p>
<p>The sovereigns also establish benchmarks which help private sector borrowers to dip into the capital markets abroad.</p>
<p>Franco shied away from saying exactly what could be expected of Brazil next. Asked if a Brady Bond buyback or debt swap might be in the offing, he replied, "No, this...we will see with time what happens."</p>
<p>The Central Bank last year won a hard fought battle with the Senate for permission to buy back restructured debt and swap it for longer-term paper but has made no apparent move in that direction. Brazilian Bradies are now trading at a tight spread.</p>
<p>"Let's wait and see if some operation, some new opportunity emerges," Franco said. "Our attitide has always been to take advantage of opportunities that appear rapidly."</p>
<p>Franco dismissed some analysts' speculation that the mark bond could be regarded as part of a strategy to establish a "cushion" against Brazil's current account gap, which reached 3.27 percent of gross domestic product last year.</p>
<p>"I think that's stretching the point. This bond, it's worth about $310 million, has no value as a cushion."</p>
<p>Likewise with speculation that the purpose was to switch expensive domestic debt for less costly overseas borrowing.</p>
<p>Franco argued that spreads between domestic and external debt had narrowed, with National Treasury dollar-indexed notes paying an after-tax interest rate of about 9.0 percent.</p>
<p>"It's not very different to the rates we get abroad though of course the maturities are shorter (here). Basicly, the fiscal motive is no longer as strong as it used to be," Franco said.</p>
<p>The success of the mark contrasted with the reception last November of Brazil's $750 million 8-7/8 global due 2001, which launched at 260 b.p. over U.S. Treasuries but traded down to 290 b.p. over.</p>
<p>Franco said the global had to be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and required a road show. By the time the registration process had been completed, a once-favourable market had turned against the Brazilian paper.</p>
<p>"This time, we caught the market at the right moment," he said.</p>
