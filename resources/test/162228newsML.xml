<p>More than one million refugees have been abandoned to their fate in eastern Zaire where Tutsi rebels have driven Zaire's rag-tag army from a string of towns bordering Tutsi-led Rwanda and Burundi.</p>
<p>"The biggest problem is that we have left behind us hundreds of thousands of refugees who have absolutely nobody to feed them," Michelle Quintaglie of the U.N. World Food Programme said after foreign aid workers fled across the Rwandan border.</p>
<p>"With our departure there is not a single relief worker in the entire eastern Zaire region," said Panos Moumtzis of the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR. "The prospects for the Rwandans and the Zaireans are disastrous."</p>
<p>The battle for Goma, headquarters of the international relief effort in the region, raged on Saturday with Zairean troops fighting rebels and Rwandan soldiers, witnesses said.</p>
<p>It was unclear who controlled the city at nightfall but Reuters photographer George Malala said much of the centre of Goma, a key base for the Zairean army, was in the hands of the Rwandans and rebels.</p>
<p>In Bukavu to the south, the rebels consolidated their hold and prepared to welcome their leader Laurent Kabila, posting guards on shops and warning looters they would be hanged.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid of our army. We are not the same as the army we have driven out. We are not going to steal and loot from you as they did," a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Corpses were strewn on Bukavu's streets. Initial estimates put the death toll at at least 83, including the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Bukavu.</p>
<p>Zaire is the latest victim of Hutu-Tutsi rivalry which has blighted life in Rwanda and Burundi for generations.</p>
<p>More than one million Hutu refugees have lived in camps in eastern Zaire since 1994 when they fled Rwanda fearing reprisals or an upsurge in civil war after the genocide of Tutsis there.</p>
<p>Around 200,000 Hutus from Burundi are also in Zaire, having fled ethnic violence at home.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Zaireans caught up in the fighting have joined the mass of displaced humanity in the conflict zone.</p>
<p>In Mugunga camp west of Goma, the world's biggest refugee complex, the 400,000 Rwandans included thousands of armed Hutus hardliners blamed for the 1994 genocide.</p>
<p>In Kinshasa, Zaire's Army Chief of General Staff, General Eluki Monga Aundu, accused Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo, himself part-Tutsi, of not doing enough to help soldiers at the front.</p>
<p>"We regret that the government is moving too slowly and has not yet given us the necessary means," he said.</p>
<p>Kengo, a target of army and popular criticism and under growing pressure to resign, ruled out peace talks until all foreign troops left Zairean soil.</p>
<p>Eluki accused the U.N. and international community of failing to condemn Rwandan aggression.</p>
<p>He promised a firm response against Rwandan troops once the army had the necessary equipment.</p>
<p>"We are going to stop them, we are going to counter attack. The bombardment of Gisenyi (in Rwanda) was only the beginning... we will not stop at the border."</p>
<p>Earlier, the government said there should be a "forced and progressive expulsion of all the Rwandan Hutu refugees" camped on Zairean territory and told the U.N. to provide food aid and protective corridors in Rwanda or Burundi.</p>
<p>International diplomatic efforts to find a solution have made little headway. A regional African summit is scheduled to be held in Kenya on Tuesday -- at the moment, without Zaire.</p>
<p>Belgium, a former colonial power in the area, called on Saturday for restraint from both Zaire and Rwanda and urged the warring parties to do all in their power to let refugees in Zaire return home to Rwanda.</p>
<p>Belgian Foreign Minister Erik Derycke warned Rwanda in a statement against "all military incursions into Zairean territory, the integrity of which can in no way be violated".</p>
<p>At the same time he urged Zairean armed forces to "abstain from all provocation".</p>
<p>Belgium was the former colonial power in Zaire and Rwanda and Burundi were once Belgian protectorates.</p>
