<p>Fighting broke out around the beachfront military headquarters in Sierra Leone's capital on Monday after Nigerian ships began a bombardment against coup leaders at daybreak, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Rebels allied to the coup makers and Sierra Leonean soldiers exchanged fire with Nigerian troops protecting a hotel near the military headquarters in which about 1,000 West African foreigners were holed up.</p>
<p>Civilians took refuge in the hotel basement. The building's first and second floor windows were shattered by incoming fire and four Nigerian soldiers were lightly wounded.</p>
<p>The Nigerians said they took over the international airport at Lungi, north of the capital, which had been under uneasy joint control since the May 25 coup.</p>
<p>"We took it this morning. There was a firefight with the Sierra Leonean forces there but it didn't last long at all," a Nigerian commander told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said Lungi airport would now be used to bring in rapid reinforcements for the intervention to restore the country's elected government. The smaller Hastings airport on the eastern outskirts of Freetown near the Nigerian base was also being used.</p>
<p>A Reuters reporter saw the bodies of a couple and their grandson in the Aberdeen district who neighbours said had been killed when a mortar shell from the Nigerian ships hit their house. There was no other sign of shells hitting targets.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people took to the streets waving green leaves and chanting "We want peace". A spokesman for the coup leaders speaking on state radio urged people to protest against the Nigerian offensive.</p>
<p>The booming of naval guns shook the capital at 6 a.m. (0600 GMT) as Nigerian vessels opened fire. The bombardment continued intermittently during the morning.</p>
<p>Nigeria, Ghana and Guinea sent troops to Sierra Leone after the coup, ready for a strike if talks with Major Johnny Paul Koromah and his Armed Forces Revolutionary Council failed.</p>
<p>A Nigerian diplomat said Monday's attack followed a breakdown of last-minute negotiations which went on late into Sunday night. "Each time we reached an agreement, the chairman was nowhere to be found to sign it," he said.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Koromah announced his 20-member council, with rebel leader Foday Sankoh as vice chairman and including three more members of Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front (RUF).</p>
<p>A senior diplomat said Sankoh's rebels, who have been fighting a bush war since 1991 and have allied with the coupmakers, opposed a settlement and had not been in the talks.</p>
<p>Sankoh is in detention at a hotel in the Nigerian capital. His telephone was cut off after he called on his rebels to fight alongside the army.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the RUF's resistance to a deal had led to serious rifts between its commanders and the coup leaders. Sierra Leone sources said two people had been killed in gunfights between RUF rebels and soldiers inside Koromah's military headquarters on a Freetown beachfront.</p>
<p>On Sunday U.S. helicopters evacuated the last Americans and Europeans fleeing the violence that followed the coup.</p>
