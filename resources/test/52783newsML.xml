<p>Oil and gas producer Petroleum Securities Australia Ltd (Petsec) reported a doubling of its total petroleum reserves in the year to June 30 and a three-fold increase in production.</p>
<p>In posting a doubling of annual net profit after abnormal and extraordinary items to A$6.8 million, Petsec said net proven oil reserves leapt to 10.2 million barrels from 6.9 million barrels in 1994/95.</p>
<p>Net gas reserves jumped to 61.9 billion cubic feet (bcf) from 20.3 bcf, it added.  </p>
<p>The total net reserves doubled to 123.2 bcf equivalent from 61.6 bcf equivalent, Petsec said.</p>
<p>The annual accounts also showed production had surged to a total 21.6 billion bcf equivalent from 7.2 bcf equivalent.</p>
<p>"The sharp increase in the company's petroleum reserves followed a significantly expanded and successful exploration and development programme in the Gulf of Mexico ... during the past year," Petsec managing director Terry Fern said in a statement.</p>
<p>Petsec drilled 10 wells in the year, all of them productive, he said. "This is the second successive year that the company has doubled its proved reserves," he added.  </p>
<p>Sales revenue, after royalties, from the Gulf of Mexico rose to A$67.6 million, up A$44.4 million on 1994/95, Petsec said.</p>
<p>It said it planned to spend about US$70 million on exploration and development in 1996/97, including the drilling of at least 12 wells in the Gulf of Mexico region in the year.</p>
<p>Before an extraordinary loss arising from the removal of Climax Mining Ltd from Petsec's consolidated accounts, net profit was A$13.6 million, up from A$3.3 million in 1994/95.</p>
