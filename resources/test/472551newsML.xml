<p>German steel and engineering group Thyssen AG said on Thursday it had no evidence that anyone was amassing its shares but it planned to take steps to protect itself from any hostile takeover.</p>
<p>Thyssen chairman Dieter Vogel, speaking to reporters in Duesseldorf, said he wanted to ensure in the future that there were identifiable investors holding up to 25 percent of Thyssen shares who could be called upon to reject a takeover bid.</p>
<p>"We will address this question in the foreseeable future," Vogel said but gave no further details.</p>
<p>Thyssen's shares are widely held and without any single large investor the company is vulnerable to a takeover.</p>
<p>Vogel was speaking at a news conference to detail the merger of carbon steel activities of Thyssen and Fried. Krupp AG Hoesch-Krupp after Krupp's failed hostile takeover bid for the Thyssen group.</p>
<p>Krupp permanently withdrew its bid on Monday, but Vogel said it would have been rejected by shareholders.</p>
<p>"More than 25 percent of our shareholders have informed me in the past week that they would not have agreed to the takeover in the form that it was presented," Vogel said.</p>
<p>Krupp's offer of 435 marks a share to Thyssen shareholders was a considerable premium above the share price at the time, but Vogel insisted that the huge debt Krupp would have accrued to buy Thyssen would have crippled the company.</p>
<p>Thyssen finance chief Heinz-Gerd Stein said the company's own studies showed that a merged Thyssen-Krupp, if brought about according to Krupp's plan, would have had a debt rating of "triple B, or junk-bond quality."</p>
<p>Thyssen shares had risen considerably over the past several months prior to Krupp's bid, giving rise to speculation that an investor or group of investors were amassing a sizeable packet of shares, but Stein said there was no evidence of this.</p>
<p>"From January 1995 through March 1997 there were no exceptional developments," he said holding up a chart citing relatively steady volume of Thyssen share purchases during the period to which he referred.</p>
<p>Krupp's takeover bid sparked an emotional discussion in Germany about such U.S.-style corporate moves as German politicians and labour condemned Krupp for violating Germany's consensus approach to mergers.</p>
<p>But Vogel said his rejection of Krupp's bid was directed at this particular case, not at unsolicited takeovers in general.</p>
<p>"Joint stock companies belong to their shareholders and if these receive an offer at a fair share price ... then you cannot really have anything against such a takeover," he said.</p>
