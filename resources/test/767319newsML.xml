<p>Investors marked down shares in grocery wholesaler and retailer Davids Ltd on Wednesday after the company announced a A$262 million abnormal write-down and a revamped senior management.</p>
<p>Davids said the changes were aimed at delivering a "more competitive platform for the next decade" following the company's rapid growth over the past three years.</p>
<p>However, its shares closed down 11 cents at A$1.00, a 43 percent fall from the start of the year, amid concerns at the level of future earnings.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the write-downs showed Davids had paid too much for a series of recent acquisitions, including Jewel Food Stores, QIW Retailers and Composite Buyers.</p>
<p>And they said the group still had to deal with the gradual erosion of its market share, particularly from the growth of retail giant Woolworth Ltd's wholesale arm, Australian Independent Wholesalers (AIW).</p>
<p>Davids announced John David would step down as chief executive officer and executive chairman to become non-executive chairman, although Jeff David would remain as managing director and deputy chief executive officer.  </p>
<p>Former Consolidated Press finance director and Brierley Investments director Don Bourke, who joined the company in June to assist in its rationalisation, is the new chief executive.</p>
<p>Davids also said it had ended talks with PFD Food Services Pty Ltd to create Australia's largest food service company, warned of a lower than expected 1996/97 profit, and said it would not pay a final dividend.</p>
<p>Bourke told Reuters the 1996/97 pre-abnormals full year net profit would be "substantially" below analysts' forecasts of around A$48 million. "The bottom line is that the profit hasn't been satisfactory in the second half of the year," he said.  </p>
<p>Davids posted a 1995/96 net profit of A$51.8 million.</p>
<p>Bourke said the decision not to proceed with the PFD merger would allow Davids to concentrate on its getting its house in order, although he added that the terms and conditions proposed by Davids had been unacceptable to PFD.</p>
<p>The A$262 million abnormal write-down related to goodwill, surplus and non-performing assets and changes in accounting policy, Davids said.</p>
<p>Bourke said about A$80 million of the A$89 million goodwill write-off related to QIW/CBL following lower sales due to Woolworths entry into the wholesale business.  </p>
<p>Business reorganisation expenses partly related to Davids plans to exit 32 company-owned stores over the next two years.</p>
<p>The goodwill write-off would add to future earnings as the company would no longer have to amortise about A$20 million of goodwill each year, a Melbourne-based analyst said.</p>
<p>However, concern remained about the strength of future earnings. "The goodwill is the big issue because they thought they would get particular future earnings from some businesses which they acquired," said BNP Equities analyst Helen Cameron.  </p>
<p>"What you are really saying when you write down that value of goodwill is 'our future earnings are going to be less than we had anticipated'," Cameron said.</p>
