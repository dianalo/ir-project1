<p>Duke Power Co's 1,129 megawatt McGuire nuclear power unit 1 was operating at full power Tuesday, returning from an outage that began Oct 31, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said.</p>
<p>The Cornelius, N.C., unit was running at 100 percent production as of early Tuesday, NRC said in its daily plant status report.</p>
<p>McGuire 1 and the adjacent 1,129 megawatt McGuire unit 2 were shut after one of the facility's four backup battery banks failed to meet performance criteria during a test.</p>
<p>McGuire unit 2 was operating at six percent of capacity as of early Tuesday and was "holding due to a turbine problem," the NRC said in the report.</p>
<p>Separately, Duke's Oconee nuclear facility in Seneca, S.C. remains shut following a steam pipe rupture in September that injured seven employees.</p>
<p>No restart date has been set for the Oconoee units.</p>
<p>The three Oconee power units have the capacity to produce a combined total of 2,538 megawatts of electricity.</p>
