<p>Legislators of Taipei county, Taiwan's biggest, voted on Thursday to exclude Japanese firms from county contracts to protest Japan's assertion of sovereignty over a chain of East China Sea islands, officials said.</p>
<p>A resolution passed by the legislator also called on the county to boycott all Japanese goods, a county official told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>Both sanctions would stand until a mounting dispute over the islands is resolved, he said.</p>
<p>"The Taipei county council passed a resolution urging Taipei county residents to boycott Japanese goods and will exclude Japanese firms from bidding for any county government construction projects," the official said.  </p>
<p>Taipei county, which surrounds but does not include the Taiwan capital Taipei, is the largest county on the island and includes densely urban sections as well as some farmland.</p>
<p>It was not immediately known how much contract construction work might be affected by the resolution.</p>
<p>A festering dispute over the Diaoyus, called the Senkakus in Japanese, erupted in July after the right-wing Japan Youth Federation erected a lighthouse on one, angering rival claimants Taiwan and China.</p>
<p>The row intensified in recent days after Tokyo, effectively supporting the rightists, sent patrol ships to repel private Taiwan vessels that tried to approach the islands.</p>
<p>The row has touched off anti-Japanese protests in Chinese communities in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and mainland China.</p>
<p>Taiwanese fishermen on Thursday hurled rotten fish at Japan's Taipei visa office and burned Japanese flags on Thursday to protest Tokyo's expulsion of Taiwan fishing boats near the uninhabited islands.</p>
