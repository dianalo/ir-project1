<p>SWITZERLAND HANDS OVER BOFORS PAPERS TO INDIA</p>
<p>Swiss authorities handed over bank documents relating to the $1.3 billion Bofors case to the Indian government at the Swiss capital of Berne. Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) sources said the documents, running close to 1,000 pages, were expected to arrive in India by the weekend. CBl director Joginder Singh, leader of three-member team which will bring back the documents, said there was no reason to fear the safety of the documents in transit or once they arrived in India as the Swiss authorities had only provided the attested photocopies of the documents. This is the first time that India received secret Swiss bank documents.</p>

<p>SURVEILLANCE ON HEADQUARTERS REPREHENSIBLE: CONGRESS</p>
<p>Despite Congress' belief that the Deve Gowda government was working against it, the party would not withdraw support to it now. Congress spokesperson V.N. Gadgil said the party took serious view of the reports that the All India Congress Committee (AICC) headquarters was under surveillance from the official agencies, but would not do anything drastic to express its anger. Gadgil said there was no plan to call a Congress Working Committee meeting to discuss either the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe on party chief Sitaram Kesri or the alleged surveillance on the AICC headquarters. Meanwhile, the Prime Minister's Office denied reports that the interrogation of Sitaram Kesri by the CBI had been done at its instance.</p>

<p>INCOME BASED CAP FOR NEW PUBLIC DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM</p>
<p>The government fixed 15,000 rupees as the maximum annual income level for people below the poverty line to be covered under the new public distribution system (PDS). States have been directed to prepare a list of the population below the poverty line. The population above the poverty line would be gradually shifted out of the ambit of the PDS over a period of time. Earlier, the food ministry's proposal to leave the affluent out of the PDS was met with resistance from the chief ministers of most of the states.</p>

<p>STATE BANK TO CUT INTEREST RATES ON FOREIGN CURRENCY LOANS</p>
<p>The State Bank of India (SBI) plans to cut interest rates on foreign currency loans, to be disbursed through the $1.6 billion FCNR(B) window. The exact quantum of cuts would be decided later in the week. The move was apparently triggered by the poor response from Indian corporates to foreign currency denominated loans. When SBI opened its FCNR(B) window earlier this month, it had expected corporates to make a beeline to convert their rupee working capital demand loans into foreign exchange loans. The move was also expected to boost the bank's non-food credit offtake.</p>

<p>TATA-SIA TALKS DEFERED</p>
<p>The Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment (CCFI) deferred discussion on the 24 billion rupee Tata-Singapore International Airline (Tata-SIA) venture. This was because Civil Aviation Minister C.M. Ibrahim was unable to attend the CCFI meeting as he was not in Delhi. The much-awaited proposal for the new civil aviation policy was also deferred at the cabinet meeting, which followed the CCFI meeting. The Tata-SIA venture proposed to launch a domestic airlines in the country. Sources said any decision on the Tata-SIA proposal would be taken only in tandem with the civil aviation policy.</p>

<p>DOMESTIC INDUSTRY BUILDING UP CASE AGAINST MULTINATIONALS</p>
<p>The domestic industry is building up a major case against the entry of multinationals (MNCs) and the era of open takeovers. Major industrialists, at a meeting of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, decided to examine the conditions under which the Asian economies like Indonesia, Malaysia and Korea allowed entry to MNCs. The industrialists were of the opinion that a level playing field did not exist in India. Sources said the issues which were upsetting industry were the lack of a facility for companies to buy back their own shares and the lack of an adequate institutional framework for lending against shares, which made Indian corporates extremely vulnerable to takeover attempts, including those from MNCs.</p>

<p>PANEL WANTS BANK CREDIT FORMULA REPLACED</p>
<p>The move to replace the maximum permissible bank finance (MPBF) system gained momentum with all members of the panel appointed by the Indian Banks Association to suggest an alternative mechanism agreeing it should be scrapped. The MPBF system determines the flow of credit to corporates. The panel, set up at the instance of the apex bank to recommend a system that would be compatible with present-day market realities, felt banks should be allowed to fix individual exposures. The panel will now seek the views of the chambers of commerce and export organisations.</p>

<p>WORLDCOM INC TO INVEST 14 BLN RUPEES IN INDIA</p>
<p>U.S.-based telecommunications firm Worldcom Inc has decided to invest 14 billion rupees in tranches in the Indian telecommunications sector. Sources said the company intended to channel a significant part of this investment into manufacturing and assembling switching equipment. Another important area of investment would be terrestrial fibre cabling for transmission of voice and data. Sources said the U.S. major was presently on a reconnaissance mission, trying to identify an Indian partner, with which it could jointly float the venture.</p>

<p>COKE ALLOWED TO RETAIN 100 PCT IN SUBSIDIARIES</p>
<p>The Cabinet Committee on Foreign Investment has permitted Coca-Cola to retain a 100 percent stake in each of its two proposed bottling subsidiaries. It has, however, asked the company to divest up to 49 percent of its stake within five years in any downstream bottling venture set up by these two subsidiaries. This clarified the earlier approval under which the company was asked to dilute its stake to 51 percent in five years in the two bottling subsidiaries. Coke, which had asked for an amendment to the divestment clause, can now operate the two proposed companies as holding companies for investing in any bottling venture.</p>

<p>INDIAN AIRLINES-AIR INDIA MERGER PLAN SHELVED</p>
<p>The proposal to merge Indian Airlines (IA) and Air-India (AI) was shelved. Instead, a blueprint would be drawn up to create more operational synergy between the two state-owned airlines. A holding company might be set up to oversee the two carriers. Sources said the 15-member joint board of IA and AI was also being restructured, with most of the ex-officio members being changed. The joint board would, for the first time, include the chief finance adviser to the civil aviation ministry. Sources said the term of the present board would expire in February this year, after which the new board would be constituted.</p>

<p>HIND LEVER TO SWITCH TO BRANDED COMMODITIES</p>
<p>Hindustan Lever Ltd (HLL) is planning to take a plunge in the commodities market in a big way. HLL's move comes in the wake of company's failure to make any headway in the processed food business in the country. The company would be packaging and marketing branded commodities like rice, pulse, wheat flour and salt. Industry sources said HLL's new gameplan was to increase its sales volumes. Commodities like rice, wheat flour and pulses did not provide alternatives for consumers and as such, attaining sales volume would not be difficult for the Unilever subsidiary, sources added.</p>

<p>STATE BANK MAY FILL BREACH IN AT&amp;T-BIRLA LOAN</p>
<p>After being refused a loan by the Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI), AT&amp;T-Birla Communications found an ally in the State Bank of India (SBI). The telecommunications joint venture may get a non-recourse loan for its Maharashtra and Gujarat cellular projects from the SBI. The merchant banking arm of the bank, SBI Caps, is vetting AT&amp;T-Birla's proposal for the 2.34 billion rupee loan. SBI's agreeing to vet the proposal assumes significance in the light of IDBI's refusal to disburse the loan after the company refused to furnish either a corporate guarantee or a letter of comfort. SBI's positive response is a sure indication that the bank is not averse to sanctioning the loan without a corporate or an international bank guarantee, sources said.</p>

<p>GOVERNMENT CLOSE TO COMPLETING PROJECTED NET BORROWINGS</p>
<p>The government is close to completing its projected net market borrowings for the current fiscal year. It has already raised 241.77 billion rupees against the targeted 254.98 billion rupees for 1996/97 (April-March). With a 13.21 billion rupee shortfall, bankers felt it was unlikely the central bank would announce another sale of dated government securities. The aggregate gross borrowing was placed at 352.94 billion rupees for 1996/97 in the Budget. A foreign bank official said the government would be able to raise more than 40 billion rupees from the 91-day treasury bills in the next couple of months.</p>
