<p>IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus pronounced himself satisfied with the health of the world economy on Thursday but others raised questions about the vitality of Europe and Japan.</p>
<p>Speaking at a news conference ahead of the annual meeting of the IMF and World Bank, the International Monetary Fund chief predicted Europe would succeed in launching a single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>"We are working in a kind of satisfactory global environment," he told reporters.</p>
<p>The IMF on Wednesday forecast that world economic growth would pick up to 4.1 percent next year, from 3.8 percent in 1996, but singled out Europe as one possible source of concern.</p>
<p>Camdessus said he saw better times ahead for Europe and voiced confidence that European countries would be able to meet the tough budget criteria set out for participation in the new European Monetary System in 1999.</p>
<p>"I am confident that on Friday, Jan. 1, 1999, you will have the new Euro system started," Camdessus proclaimed.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters at a separate briefing, U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin also called the global economic outlook encouraging, although he expressed some reservations about prospects for Europe and Japan.</p>
<p>"Prospects have improved in Japan and Europe, but growth in those regions still looks quite moderate," Rubin said.</p>
<p>Others were even less certain about the outlook for Europe and Japan. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, a Washington think tank, told reporters he had particular doubts about the vitality of the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>He warned that the Japanese authorities were seeking a much weaker yen in order to mount an export-led expansion.</p>
<p>"I think the Japanese have decided that what they really want to do is get a much weaker yen and restore export-led growth," he said.</p>
<p>Bergsten questioned indications that the Japanese economy, which has been largely stagnant for about five years, was beginning to show consistent expansion.</p>
<p>"I'm quite pessimistic about the Japanese economy," he said. He said Japanese authorities had largely run out of ways to stimulate growth, noting that interest rates were nearly zero.</p>
<p>Rubin said it was "critically important" that Japan continue to pursue policies aimed at promoting domestic demand-led growth. "We are of course always interested in growth in Europe, too," he added.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Rubin will meet finance ministers and central bankers from the rest of the Group of Seven -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan. That gathering will take place on the fringes of the IMF/World Bank meeting.</p>
<p>The G7 is expected to discuss currency market movements as well as the health of the world economy when it meets.</p>
<p>The dollar has been buoyant recently, but Rubin showed little concern that the strength would undercut the competitiveness of U.S. exports on world markets.</p>
<p>He called the U.S. economy "very healthy," declared American industry competitive and repeated his backing for a strong dollar.</p>
<p>The IMF's Camdessus also saw little reason for concern about recent currency movements.</p>
<p>"The key currencies are now in ... a solid, well-justified constellation and we don't forsee major changes in the near future," Camdessus told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>The IMF official also gave reporters some insight into a controversial plan for the lending agency to sell off a small amount of its gold to help finance programmes to help the poorest debt-laden countries.</p>
<p>"This is a done deal," Camdessus told reporters.</p>
