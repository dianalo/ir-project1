<p>The European Parliament's environment committee is expected on Thursday to call for an action programme to improve water quality in the European Union and a legally binding framework directive.</p>
<p>Opting for this two-pronged strategy would enable the parliament to overcome its dilemma over whether to push for an action programme or a directive.</p>
<p>A programme would allow the assembly more say in drawing up the legislation but the final text would be less specifically binding on the member states than a directive.</p>
<p>Rapporteur Karl-Heinz Florenz believes one solution would be for the European Commission to formulate a coherent overall policy for EU water resources setting out the major objectives and the actions needed to achieve them.</p>
<p>In a report expected to be adopted by the environmental committee, the German Christian Democrat suggests that EU ministers and the parliament should adopt this overall policy in the form of an action programme which includes explicit implementing measures.</p>
<p>The Commission should then come up with a proposal for a water resources framework directive which converts this overall strategy into a legally-binding directive, the draft report says.</p>
<p>Among the recommendations the committee is expected to make are a call for the EU not to dilute its policies on water protection, which recent Commission reports show is deteriorating.</p>
<p>In particular, Euro-MPs are likely to criticise the Commission's communication on EU water policy - COM(96)59 - for disregarding EU treaty references to the need to respect the precautionary principle.</p>
<p>This means "such substantive requirements as emission standards and quality objectives are largely abandoned," according to Florenz's report.</p>
<p>The environment committee is due on Wednesday to adopt reports on two "daughter directives" on water policy. One concerns the quality of drinking water -- COM(94)612 -- the other Europe's bathing waters -- COM(94)36.</p>
