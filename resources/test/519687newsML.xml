<p>Dominion Resources Inc said Friday that its financial results for the remainder of 1997 are expected to reflect a reserve for potential costs related to the transition to competition for electric service in Virginia.</p>
<p>The company said sales of electricity to residential customers -- the utility's largest single source of revenue -- dropped 11.8 percent in the first quarter of 1997 from the same period in 1996.</p>
<p>This decline, the company said, was partially offset through the addition of 30,200 new retail customers last year.  </p>
<p>The amount of the reserve the company expects for 1997 will be based on earnings in excess of the company's 11.4 percent allowed return applicable to Virginia sales.</p>
<p>The company declined to release its forcast of the reserve amount for 1997.  Wall Street estimates the reserve will be between $50 to $75 million for 1997, a company spokesman said.</p>
<p>Earlier, the company announced earnings for the first quarter of $0.93 per share, up $0.06 or seven percent from operating earnings of $0.87 per share in the first quarter of 1996.</p>
