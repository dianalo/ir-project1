<p>In the three months since its chairman, Emilio Azcarrago Milmo, died, Grupo Televisa SA has erupted into internal turmoil over leadership of the media company, the Wall Street Journal said.</p>
<p>In Wednesday's electronic edition, the Journal said the fight pits Chief Operating office Guillermo Canedo White against former Televisa Vice President Alejandro Burillo Azcarrago.</p>
<p>Unnamed sources at the company told the Journal the battle will likely lead to the departure of Canedo.</p>
<p>The fight has left the investment community uneasy.</p>
<p>"This has been a ridiculous, prolonged affair," one New York analyst who covers the company said. "It's been trickling through the market for two months now, and people just want this to end."</p>
