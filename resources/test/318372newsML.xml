<headline>British Airways flies into Zagreb after 15 years.</headline>
<dateline>ZAGREB 1997-01-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>A British Airways aircraft landed at the Zagreb airport on Monday, for the first time in 15 years, Croatian state news agency HINA reported.</p>
<p>A British Airways Boeing 737 will fly six times a week, except Saturdays, from London's Gatwick Airport to Zagreb and back.</p>
<p>The director of the Zagreb airport, Tomislav Leko, told HINA that British Airways' return would be followed by other European carriers. Many air companies stopped flights to Croatia during the country's 1991-95 war with rebel minority Serbs backed by Serb-led Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Croatia and Yugoslavia last year signed a treaty normalising relations.</p>
<p>British Airways has had no regular flights to Croatia since 1982. It announced more frequent Zagreb flights for this summer, HINA said.</p>
