<p>Societe Generale Australia Ltd on Tuesday launched the first issue of its A$1 billion HOMES mortgaged backed medium term notes programme.</p>
<p>The first issue of the notes would be A$100-A$150 million and were expected to be rated AA by Standard and Poor's Corp, which reflected the rating of the underlying notes and supporting mortgages, SocGen Australia said.</p>
<p>The HOMES MTNs are floating, soft bullet to July 1998, when the issue has the right to call the HOMES MTNs back. If the call option is not exercised on the call date then the margin steps up by a further 50 basis points, it said.  </p>
<p>SocGen Australia said the issue is expected to be priced between nine and 11 basis points over the bank bill swap rate (BBSW).</p>
<p>The programme has been structured, arranged and lead managed by SocGen Australia.</p>
<p>Socgen Australia Director of Securitisation Greg Medcraft said the structure of the issue was unique as it was the first time in Australia that the same issuer has issued both commercial paper and medium term notes.  </p>
<p>"The assets have to be legally segregated so that there is no ability for cross default between the assets of the CP programme and the assets of the medium term note programme," Medcraft said in a statement.</p>
<p>He said the dealer's allocations would be based on the best bid as opposed to the more typical set amount allocation method.</p>
