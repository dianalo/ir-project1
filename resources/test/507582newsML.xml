<p>The Lebanese pound regained ground against the U.S. dollar in quiet interbank trade in Beirut on Monday and dealers said the market was calming down after a flurry of activity last week.</p>
<p>The market opened at 1,546-1,549 pounds to the dollar from 1,548.5 on Friday, but the Lebanese currency firmed steadily during the morning to 1,543-1,545, a dealer who asked not to be identified told Reuters.</p>
<p>The pound moved at the close to 1,545-1,548 per dollar as some banks closed their positions, the dealer added. He estimated trade at $4-$5 million.</p>
<p>The Bank of Lebanon's bid-offer intervention band was unchanged from last week's 1,540-1549.5 pounds per dollar.</p>
<p>"All trade was within the Bank of Lebanon's intervention rate and there was some selling of dollars by banks due to treasury bill purchases and the Eid al-Adha holiday on Thursday," the dealer added.</p>
<p>"I think it is a matter of time before we have a calm market again. There was nothing special today," he said.</p>
<p>Last week the pound fell six points against the dollar within the central bank's intervention band in interbank trade as one commercial bank bought a large amount of the U.S. currency, putting pressure on the Lebanese pound.</p>
