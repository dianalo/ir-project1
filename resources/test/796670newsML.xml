<p>A 35-year-old Texan scaled a 600-foot television tower Wednesday, slung a hammock between its struts about halfway up and settled in with a cell phone, food and newspapers, police said.</p>
<p>Virginia State police circled the base of the tower in Merrifield, using bullhorns and a sound system in an attempt to coax him down from his perch about 300 feet off the ground.</p>
<p>Television pictures showed the man, identified as Arlez Gomez of Texas, lying perfectly still and apparently sleeping in his hammock. Earlier he had been reading a newspaper.</p>
<p>Gomez is believed to have been involved in a similar incident in Killeen, Texas, in May 1996. Police said he was protesting what he alleged was a false arrest and conviction as well as a dishonorable discharge from the Army.</p>
<p>"He apparently wants to make a statement. We don't have any reason to believe he has any weapons and we don't have any reason to believe he's dangerous," police spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell said. She added that his cellphone did not seem to be turned on.</p>
<p>The tower Gomez chose to climb had been struck by lightning several times in the past and the National Weather Service was forecasting thunderstorms, she said. "He may be in a little bit of danger himself up there."</p>
<p>Police had little choice but to wait Gomez out, Caldwell said, adding that his pole-sit in Texas lasted three days.</p>
