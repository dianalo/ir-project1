<p>Hong Kong workers received an average 2.5 percent in real pay rises in 1996, down from 1995, and salary increases will be even smaller in 1997, results from a management institute survey released on Tuesday showed.</p>
<p>"The results of the 1996 Pay Trend Survey showed a weighted average increase of 8.5 percent," said Patrick Maule, chairman of the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management's Survey Committee.</p>
<p>"This means that 1996 provided real increases of about 2.5 percent given an average inflation of six percent for the year," he said.</p>
<p>The total pay increases were 1.6 percent less than in 1995.</p>
<p>About 80 percent of the 113 Hong Kong companies in the survey, which have their next salary review in January, predicted an even lower increase in 1997.</p>
<p>Salary increases had been falling since 1989, as had inflation, Maule said.</p>
<p>Staff turnover fell to 18.4 percent in the 12 months to June 1996, down from 24.1 percent in the previous year, the survey showed.</p>
<p>"The general economic downturn has resulted in an appreciable drop in staff turnover in all business sectors, but there is still plenty of room for improvement," said survey co-chairwoman Gloria Chan.</p>
