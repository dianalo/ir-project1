<p>Japan's contentious trade surplus showed a steep rise for the second month in row in May, more than trebling from a year earlier to 738.27 billion yen, the Finance Ministry said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The customs-cleared trade surplus with the United States, often a source of friction, soared 93 percent in May from a year earlier to 322.87 billion yen. The figures were not adjusted for seasonal factors.  </p>
<p>At Wednesday's exchange rate of about 113 yen to the dollar, the overall customs-cleared trade surplus in May was $6.53 billion, while the surplus with the United States was $2.85 billion.</p>
<p>While economists had been expecting the surplus to surge, the May figures were at the top end of forecasts, which had ranged from a surplus of 400 billion yen ($3.53 billion) to 760 billion yen ($6.72 billion).</p>
<p>A weaker yen against the dollar in May compared with year-earlier levels continues to push up Japan's exports, by making Japanese products such as cars more competitive in global markets. The yen started strengthening in early May after falling to a nearly five-year low of about 127 yen on May 1.</p>
<p>Economists said the big jump in Japan's external surplus may fan trade friction fears as Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto prepares for this weekend's summit meeting of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations in Denver, Colorado. ($1=113 yen)</p>
