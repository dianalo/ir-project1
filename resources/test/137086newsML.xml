<p>The federal government issued an emergency declaration for the California counties of Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego due to fire damage, a spokesman for Gov. Pete Wilson said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The federal emergency declaration would make residents who have been displaced as a result of the fires eligible for temporary housing assistance, Wilson spokesman Ron Low said.</p>
<p>The federal declaration would also allow local agencies to recover fire response costs and over-time costs incurred fighting the blazes, Low said.</p>
<p>Wilson will issue a statement on the declaration shortly.  </p>
<p>"This declaration will provide additional resources to help fight the fires and will allow those who have lost their homes to be eligible for temporary housing and to rebuild as quickly as possible," Low said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Wilson declared a state of emergency in the three southern California counties.</p>
<p>Wind-blown wildfires erupted on Monday from the movie star colony of Malibu to mountains along the Mexican border. They have destroyed, or damaged more than 100 homes, injured 11 people and burned some 35,000 acres (14,000 hectares) of land.</p>
