<p>British police, fearing possible Irish guerrilla attacks, launched an advertising campaign on Tuesday to encourage people to report suspicious activities to a confidential hotline.</p>
<p>"In the days and months ahead, we have reason to believe that the menace of terrorism, particularly in terms of murder, mayhem and damage to the public of Great Britain, remains," Assistant Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police David Veness told a news conference.  </p>
<p>"I am appealing to the public to tell us what they know. Terrorists intend to kill and maim and cause massive economic damage here in Great Britain."</p>
<p>Almost 100,000 posters and stickers will be displayed throughout London to encourage people to call a confidential hotline with information about suspicious people or activities.</p>
<p>It is the first campaign of its kind on the British mainland and followed reports last week that security services feared new attacks by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) before Christmas.  </p>
<p>The IRA has planted seven bombs on the British mainland since abandoning a 17-month truce in February, citing British instransigence in the Northern Ireland peace process.</p>
<p>The adverts are set against a black background with the slogan "Terrorism...Help Us Defeat It".</p>
<p>The police issued their warning despite recent successes against the guerrillas, who want a united Ireland and an end to rule from London.</p>
<p>Last month, police seized 100 tonnes of explosives and weapons in London raids and charged four people with conspiracy to cause explosions.</p>
<p>Police in the Irish Republic said on Monday they had seized a rocket launcher, explosives and weapons at what appeared to be an IRA guerrilla training camp. Five men were arrested and remanded in custody.</p>
