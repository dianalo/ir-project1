<p>A New Zealand bank employee was shot dead on Wednesday in an armed holdup during which several people were held hostage, police said.</p>
<p>They said a man surrendered to police soon after the fatal shot was fired. The victim was named as Bill Brown.</p>
<p>"The security of our staff and customers is paramount and robberies, particularly where there are firearms involved, are situations we fear and dread in banking," said Harry Price, chief executive of WestpacTrust Bank.</p>
<p>"WestpacTrust staff are shocked and saddened by the loss of a colleague in such terrible circumstances."</p>
<p>Police and witnesses said a man brandishing a double-barrelled shotgun held several hostages for about an hour at the bank in Naenae, near Wellington, before being arrested.</p>
