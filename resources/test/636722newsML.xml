<p>NZ First MP Tukoroirangi Morgan denied offering to sell his story to a television network for NZ$20,000 after both TV3 and TVNZ reported receiving approaches from a lawyer claiming to represent the MP.</p>
<p>New Zealand First leader Winston Peters met Morgan last night shortly after TV3 broadcast a taped conversation with Auckland solicitor Chris Reid, in which Reid claimed he represented Morgan and wanted to offer the network an "exclusive" interview.</p>
<p>Asked afterwards if it was true he had offered to sell his story, Mr Morgan said "No" before rushing into another meeting.  </p>
<p>On the basis of Morgan's assurances, Peters also denied the charge, saying Reid had never been employed to represent Morgan.</p>
<p>"There is no basis to it. Mr Morgan does not have a lawyer called Mr Reid. He never gave any instructions to a lawyer called Mr Reid. Therefore, whatever actions were taken were not taken on Mr Morgan's authority and there the story ends," Peters told reporters.</p>
<p>Calls to Mr Reid's Auckland office were being intercepted by an answerphone last night and his cellphone was switched off.  </p>
<p>Morgan's political career has been marred by revelations about thousands of dollars in salary and perks he received while working for publicly-funded Maori broadcaster Aotearoa Television Network last year. A Serious Fraud Office report on the company's affairs is due shortly.</p>
<p>On Three National News, presenter John Campbell said he received an approach from Mr Reid this afternoon in which Mr Reid offered an exclusive interview with Mr Morgan.</p>
<p>TVNZ presenter Paul Holmes later confirmed his Holmes show had also received an approach.</p>
