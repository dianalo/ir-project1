<p>The Special Committee on Agriculture (SCA) criticised an independent report advocating the abolition of the milk quota system, EU officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The committee discussed on Monday during an informal EU Farm Council, a report by Professor S.J. Sheehy on dairy policy options.</p>
<p>"A majority of delegations were very reluctant to abandon the quota system," an EU official said.</p>
<p>The report argued that the EU had strong reasons to end milk quotas ahead of the next round of world farm trade talks starting in 1999 and of the EU's enlargement eastwards.</p>
<p>The ending of milk quotas would have to be linked with a sharp cut in prices to prevent a big increase in production as farmers rush to use spare production capacity.</p>
<p>A reduction in prices would help the EU withstand increased competition from cheap imports as it further opens its borders under the next world trade agreement.</p>
<p>The EU would also avoid having to impose milk production quotas or pay compensation to farmers from former communist countries in eastern Europe when they join the EU.</p>
<p>EU officials said that member states reacted as follows to the three options discussed in the report:</p>
<p>1. Maintaining quotas: Germany, Austria, Spain, Greece and Portugal said quotas must be extended beyond 2000. They argued that the quota system ensured market stability, adequate income for producers, secure supplies for consumers and an EU presence on world markets.</p>
<p>2. Quota/Prices: Belgium, Netherlands and Finland backed this comromise approach which would allow some price fluctuation in line with international markets and increased imports due under the new world trade agreement.</p>
<p>3. Gradual ending of quotas combined with compensation paid directly to farmers: Only Britain, Sweden and Denmark backed this free market approach.</p>
<p>France, which criticised the report for being biased towards the free market option, said it was premature to discuss dairy policy reform.</p>
<p>Italy said that any change in quotas must include an increase in its allocation which only covers 60 percent of its needs.</p>
<p>The European Commission reminded member states that any changes would have to be compatible with the rules of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>It added that economic efficiency, export capability and social factors -- such as steps to aid young farmers or producers in mountain regions -- must also be taken into account.</p>
<p>The Commission is due to present dairy reform proposals early next year and it will be the subject of the next informal Farm Council in Zeeland in May 1997 under the Dutch EU Presidency.</p>
