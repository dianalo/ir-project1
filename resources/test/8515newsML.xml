<p>Canada's Trizec Corporation and Granit Polus Rt, registered in Hungary, will set up a joint venture for $3 billion in real estate development, mostly in eastern Europe, Granit Polus said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Granit Polus chairman Sandor Demjan told a news conference that the projects would include the construction of shopping malls, modern office buildings and industrial parks.</p>
<p>Trizec, one of North America's largest real estate developers, belongs to the Horsham holding controlled by Peter Munk, who also holds a stake in Granit Polus. Andrew Sarlos, also a Hungarian-Canadian businessman, has an interest in Granit Polus.</p>
<p>The joint venture will be equally owned by Granit Polus and Trizec, and its general director will be Ferenc Bartha, Hungary's former chief privatisator.</p>
<p>Demjan said Granit Polus will open its first shopping mall, the 52,000 sq metre Polus centre on the outskirts of Budapest, formerly the site of a Soviet military base, on November 8, following just 10 months of construction.</p>
<p>"This (rapidness) will be a world record," Demjan said.</p>
<p>In European countries in transition from communist-type systems, shopping malls account for a small portion of retail sales, compared with some 50 percent in Western Europe and 70 percent in the U.S.</p>
