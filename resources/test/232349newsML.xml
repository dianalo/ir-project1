<p>Looking for a safe haven for their funds, the Nazis secretly sent more than a billion dollars to Argentine banks, insurance companies and commercial firms a month before the Second World War ended, according to a secret U.S. diplomatic estimate declassified on Monday.</p>
<p>The April 1945 document, from the U.S. embassy in Buenos Aires to the secretary of state, said that figure was an estimate based on "financial reports and conjecture" because the embassy "did not have contact with Argentine authorities who might assist."</p>
<p>The document was released by the World Jewish Congress, whose researchers have been combing the U.S. National Archives to trace Nazi funds, along with a letter from Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. which warned in February 1945 that the Nazis had penetrated the Argentine economy.</p>
<p>The Morgenthau letter, to acting Secretary of State Joseph Grew, said, "Argentina is not only a likely refuge for Nazi criminals but also has been and still is the focal point of Nazi financial and economic activity in this hemisphere."</p>
<p>The embassy letter said that its best estimate of what the Nazis had invested in Argentina was $500 million in commercial firms, $500 million in farms and ranches, $105 million in banks and $40 million in insurance companies.</p>
<p>It added that it was not including in its esitmate cash and securities sent to Argentina from Germany or through European middlemen.</p>
<p>The Argentine Central Bank last week gave officials from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Los Angeles five volumes detailing funds transferred from banks in Switzerland, Spain and Portugal to Argentina between 1939-1949.</p>
<p>Argentina's Jewish community, one of the largest in the world, believes part of the huge wealth that was plundered from Holocaust victims found its way to the country.</p>
<p>Argentina was a safe haven for such notorious Nazi war criminals as Holocaust architect Adolf Eichmann and SS Captain Erich Priebke, who last year was extradited to Italy.</p>
