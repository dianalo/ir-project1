<p>IPE Brent crude futures hovered just above session lows near $19 a barrel on Tuesday afternoon and showed little sign of recovering against a weak fundamental backdrop, dealers said.</p>
<p>At 1545 GMT, April Brent crude was trading down 22 cents at $19.06 a barrel, just four cents above the intraday low. May Brent, which takes over as the prompt contract next Monday, was 16 cents off at $18.99 a barrel.</p>
<p>"I don't think we're going to see any recovery given the state of the physical market," said a broker.</p>
<p>Spot markets continued to slide on Tuesday, traders said.  </p>
<p>Cash market traders said the weight of unsold March crudes from the North Sea and West Africa were exacting a heavy toll.</p>
<p>Norwegian Gullfaks crude traded at a 42-cent discount to benchmark wet Brent on Tuesday, 27 cents weaker than on Friday.</p>
<p>Brokers said most activity on the IPE was centred on spread dealing as traders liquidated April positions ahead of the prompt contract's expiry on Friday.</p>
<p>April/May was 12 cents weaker and just clinging onto a one-cent backwardation, while May/June was trading at a two-cent premium, six cents weaker.</p>
<p>"There's a degree of rolling in April/May," said a broker.  </p>
<p>Brokers were waiting for the release of latest U.S. inventory data due after the markets close on Tuesday for clues as to the next major move.</p>
<p>"The market could be heading for another push lower but it may wait until after the figures come out," said one, referring to the American Petroleum Institute (API) data due out later.</p>
<p>Immediate support on April Brent was seen at $18.95-$19.02 a barrel.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, March gas oil was $3.75 weaker at $163.25 a tonne. The March/April spread was steady in a $2 contango.</p>
