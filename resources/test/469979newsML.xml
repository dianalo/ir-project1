<headline>PHILIPS SHARES CLIMB 5.0 PERCENT.</headline>
<text>
<p>AMSTERDAM, March 26 - Shares in Philips Electronics NV rose 4.00 guilders or 4.8 percent, to 87.40, boosted by a gain in U.S. high technology stocks overnight, analysts said.</p>
<p>"There hasn't been anything new that I can think about, although there was a magazine interview with (chairman) Cor Boonstra which went back over the break-up value that might have had some influence on the stock," one analyst said.</p>
<p>Fortune Magazine's March 31 issue carries a lengthy interview with Boonstra in which the article points out previously voiced comments from analysts that the break-up value of the stock is higher than its recent share price. -- Amsterdam newsroom +31 20 504 5000, Fax +31 20 504 5040</p>
