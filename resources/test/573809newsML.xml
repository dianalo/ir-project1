<p>Japan's current account surplus is unlikely to again become a major issue with other nations as the country's economic recovery is being led by domestic demand, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said on Friday.</p>
<p>"The current account balance is unlikely to become a problem. We've overcome economic management led by external demand and have returned to recovery centring on domestic demand," Mitsuzuka said.</p>
<p>He said Japan explained its basic economic management policy to the United States and other Group of Seven (G7) nations during the G7 meeting in late April in Washington.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka said Japan is steadiliy carrying out economic structural reforms and it had urged leading nations to take a more long-term perspective on the issue.</p>
