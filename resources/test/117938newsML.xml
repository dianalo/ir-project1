<headline>Chrysler CEO sees replacement of Toledo plant.</headline>
<dateline>BIRMINGHAM, Mich 1996-10-14</dateline>

<p>Chrysler Corp chairman Robert Eaton said Monday that the automaker will eventually replace its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep assembly plant, but added that a new facility may not be built in Toledo.</p>
<p>Eaton, speaking to reporters at a dinner Monday night, said the plant could be built as much as 50 miles away from Toledo and still use the same workforce.</p>
<p>"At some point in time, we will replace that plant, not necessarily in Toledo," Eaton said. "It's a competitive world out there."</p>
<p>He declined to offer a timetable for replacement of the plant or say whether Chrysler would seek incentives in deciding its location.</p>
<p>The Toledo facility, much of which was first built in 1910 by the Willys-Overland Co., is currently the oldest operating auto plant in the United States. Chrysler acquired the factory, which builds Jeep Cherokee and Wrangler sport/utility vehicles, in 1987 when it bought American Motors Corp.</p>
<p>The plant employs about 5,575 people and builds 777 Cherokees and 398 Wranglers per day, according to information available on Chrysler's Internet website.</p>
<p>But even without replacing Toledo, Eaton said he believes Chrysler can add up to 1 million units worth of new annual assembly capacity in its present facilities.</p>
<p>He said Chrysler can now build about 3 million units a year and can bring that to roughly 4 million without building a new assembly plant. Instead, Chrysler can increase assembly line rates, add more production shifts and boost the availability of key components, such as engines and transmissions, he said.</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Chrysler disclosed that it plans to boost its truck production capability by about 190,000 units in 1997 over 1996 levels, which include the production of a new Dodge sport/utility vehicle in Newark, Del.</p>
<p>Eaton said Chrysler is investing about $500 million into the Newark assembly plant for the new vehicle. The investment will pay for a new body shop and a new paint shop that uses a low-emission water-borne painting process, he said.</p>
