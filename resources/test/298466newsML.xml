<headline>COMEX copper ends weaker but most gains intact.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-10</dateline>

<p>COMEX copper settled a touch lower but held on to most of the week's gains which propelled the March contract to its highest level since just before the Sumitomo red metal trading scandal broke last June.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was expected to retrace slightly, partly on profit-taking and producer hedging, following the strong push higher this week, with March settling 3.40 cents above last Friday's close.</p>
<p>LME stocks fell a modest 3,425 tonnes to 131,275 tonnes, although some traders said a small hike had been expected. Cold weather in Europe may have hindered delivery of metal into warehouses there, traders said.</p>
<p>"Today was just consolidation," a broker said. "But there are some tight dates in February on LME and shorts in those dates are being squeezed. I think that maybe next week we will test the highs again."</p>
<p>The technical tightness was reflected in the LME cash to three months premium which edged up during the week to end Friday at $147/$152, giving support to nearby months.</p>
<p>March copper settled 0.45 cent weaker at 106.10 cents per pound, traded 106.90 to 105.30 cents. Spot January also went out 0.45 cent lower at 108.50 cents.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 10,000 lots compared to Thursday's official 8,727 lots. Switches totaled 1,734.</p>
