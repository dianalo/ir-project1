<p>Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole campaigned through the night on his way to California, where he will make his last attempt on Sunday to capture the biggest electoral prize.</p>
<p>Dole addressed night-time campaign rallies in Sioux Falls, South Dakota (corrects from Iowa), and Grand Junction, Colorado, and planned another stop in Las Vegas on his way to a pre-dawn landing in San Diego to begin a daylong swing through California.</p>
<p>"Ninety-six hours, around the clock, around the clock," he said in Colorado, his voice showing some signs of strain.</p>
<p>"We are going to demonstrate to the American people what dedication and commitment is all about. We are going to excite the American people. We are going to get them to respond on election day and surprise the pollsters, surprise the pundits, surprise everybody else."</p>
<p>The stop in Grand Junction at a chilly midnight rally under jet-black western skies marked his 10th state in the planned 96-hour campaign marathon that began Friday and is to continue to Election Day, Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dole is seeking to overcome a persistent, though narrowing, deficit in the polls against President Bill Clinton with a last-ditch burst of campaigning and a focus on allegations of ethical lapses in the Clinton administration.</p>
<p>"We're going to demonstrate (that) the American people are waking up. They want good honest government. They want someone to tell them the truth," Dole told the rally in Sioux Falls, where children tried to doze on the floor and parents cheered.</p>
<p>California, with 54 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency, is the largest prize of the contest and has been steadily pursued by Dole. But Dole continues to trail Clinton, who has made the state one of his top political priorities throughout his presidency.</p>
<p>The Dole campaign touted, as an indication victory in the state was in sight, a new poll by Lawrence Research of 400 voters showing Dole trailing Clinton by 5 percentage points in California. The margin of error was five points.</p>
<p>Throughout the second full day of the marathon, Dole exuded a fiery spirit and enthusiasm over what he said were signs he was closing the gap against Clinton.</p>
<p>"There is something happening across America ... I think we're going to win this race," Dole said in Omaha, Nebraska, Saturday evening.</p>
<p>With his rest limited to cat-naps on the campaign plane, Dole's face had begun to look slightly drawn Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>But he bounced back by the time he reached Omaha and gave a stem-winder of a stump speech dotted with wisecracks and concluded with a flourish as he tossed campaign hats to the crowd.</p>
<p>"I feel great!," he said after the rally.</p>
<p>In the Reuters/Zogby daily tracking poll released on Saturday, Dole had closed the gap between him and Clinton to 3.8 percentage points -- 42.4 percent to 38.6 percent, with Reform Party candidate Ross Perot at 8.4 percent. Other polls, however, showed Clinton with a much larger margin.</p>
<p>After California, Dole was to head on Monday to Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee and Iowa.</p>
<p>Dole said he intended to finish his campaign on Tuesday in Independence, Missouri, the hometown of Harry Truman -- a Democrat -- who came from behind to win the 1948 presidential race.</p>
<p>He will then cast his vote in his hometown of Russell, Kansas.</p>
