<p>Traders said buying pressure and relatively low supply had sent the prices of high-caps higher.</p>

<p>Cement makers and oil refineries were the main gainers, with Moldocim closing 10,000 lei firmer at 52,500 and Romcim gaining 5,000 lei to close at 61,000.</p>
<p>Oil refinery Arpechim closed 1,500 lei higher at 46,500.</p>
<p>The RASDAQ volume slid to 2.08 million shares from over 2.5 million on Monday, while turnover went up to 12.9 billion lei from over 12.3 billion. ($=7,092 lei)</p>
