<p>Greek shares continued to move ahead on Friday with industrials spearheading the market's 1.02 percent rise. Brokers said buying outstripped offers in that sector.</p>
<p>"Blue chip industrials, especially cement, were hotly chased by both domestic and foreign players but limited offer lifted prices considerably," said Alexis Panagiotopoulos, broker at InterSec.</p>
<p>"The broader market remains dull around current levels and in recent sessions the index has settled higher because of late buying in blue chips," he added.</p>
<p>Another leg of this year's rally was not ruled out, but for the time being the market relied on low offer sizes rather than widespread buying interest.</p>
<p>"The market has turned out stronger than expected over the past week or so, but this is mostly based on thin offer rather than broadly-based buying," Panagiotopoulos said.</p>
<p>"Market sentiment is positive and earlier year-end targets for the benchmark index in the 2,000 region are still clearly in sight," he added.</p>
<p>The Athens general index added 1.02 percent or 16.14 points to 1,591.44 from Thursday's 1,575.30 close, with industrials leading the market with a 1.87 percent ascend.</p>
<p>Banks and construction advanced 0.88 and 0.64 percent respectively.</p>
<p>Turnover reached 13.5 billion drachmas on volume of 3.7 million shares.</p>
