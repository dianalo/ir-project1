<p>Britain's new Labour government plans to introduce a bill in parliament banning all handguns, government sources said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The proposed move sparked an angry retort from shooting groups with Michael Yardley of the Sportsmen's Association saying: 'This is going to wipe out the sport completely.'</p>
<p>'We are falling vitim to political correctness. Scapegoating the sport is so unjust,' he told Sky Television, arguing that Britain's Olympic pistol shooting team at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney would be wiped out.</p>
<p>Britain introduced a partial firearms ban in reaction to the massacre in March last year of 16 Scottish schoolchildren and their teacher in Dunblane by crazed lone gunman Thomas Hamilton who then committed suicide.</p>
<p>The Labour government, swept into power with a landslide election victory on May 1, now plans to introduce even tougher laws when their plans for the new parliament are laid out this week.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Labour members of parliament are said to back a total ban and party managers say they will be allowed to vote in the House of Commons according to their consciences.</p>
