<p>Mike Smith reinforced his claim to an England test place with his third 10-wicket match haul of the season on Friday as Gloucestershire swept to victory over bottom club Derbyshire in the English championship.</p>
<p>The left arm seamer finished with four for 59 to add to his six for 47 in the first innings as Derbyshire were dismissed for 329 in their second innings to lose by an innings and 35 runs.</p>
<p>Yorkshire earned maximum points for the first time this season by crushing Durham by an innings and 56 runs.</p>
<p>Yorkshire needed just two hours to collect the five remaining second-innings wickets.</p>
<p>Northamptonshire, on 216 for eight, have a lead of 305 going into the final day against title-chasing Essex.</p>
<p>Lancashire were poised for victory as Sussex closed their second innings on 150 for four, still needing 104 more runs to make their opponents bat again.</p>
<p>A partnership of 170 by Mathew Dowman (96) and Nathan Astle (100) steered Nottinghamshire to a lead of 68 with six second innings wickets left after closing on 279 for four. They had followed on after making only 133 in reply to Warwickshire's 344.</p>
<p>Hampshire wicketkeeper Adrian Aymes made an unbeaten 83 as he dragged his side from a deficit of 174 runs on first innings to a surplus of 53 when they closed their second innings on 227 for eight against Surrey.</p>
