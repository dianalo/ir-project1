<p>A rush to buy high-yielding government bonds sent major European debt futures hurtling to new contract highs on Thursday, market participants said.</p>
<p>Analysts said feelings had been mounting all week that Spain and Italy's entry in European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will be decided on a political, rather than an economic basis.</p>
<p>"This is a panic buying frenzy," said Andy Bevan, senior international economist at Goldman Sachs in London. "There's a growing feeling that Spain and Italy cannot be left out.</p>
<p>Bevan said fundamental economic analysis was useless when EMU entry would likely be based on political considerations.</p>
<p>Earlier in the session, December Italian bond (BTP) futures shot to a new contract high of 123.98 on LIFFE, while Spanish bond (Bonos) futures on MEFF set a new high of 107.67.</p>
<p>"It started with the high-yielders as a driving force and then snowballed in all the others," said a futures broker at a U.S. investment bank in London.</p>
<p>He said British government gilts were particularly buoyant, as the Labour Party conference had reduced fears that a potential Labour government would be unfriendly to the markets.</p>
<p>December gilt futures set a new contract high of 110-23.</p>
<p>December German Bunds set a new contract high at 99.32 while French December notionnel futures shot to a new high at 125.54.</p>
<p>Traders noted that gilts futures were at their highest level since January on a continuing trend.</p>
<p>Bevan said investors considered that the larger the number of participants in the first round of EMU, scheduled to start in 1999, the greater the likelihood of Britain deciding to join.</p>
<p>"The U.K. can't be on the outside if everyone else in on the inside," he said.</p>
<p>The broker at the U.S. bank said he expected the gilt/Bund spread to squeeze further towards the 150 basis point level. It was at 154 points by 0959 GMT, its narrowest since mid-July.</p>
<p>Julian Jessop, chief european economist at Nikko Europe in London said even if EMU went ahead without Britain, investors were still hopeful about the prospects for gilts.</p>
<p>"They could do very well as an alternative to the Euro, and an alternative with good economic fundamentals," he said.</p>
<p>Bevan said the current rally in high-yielders was a bubble which would soon burst, and could lead to significant drops.</p>
<p>Earlier, Spanish bonds had also benefitted from a 50 basis point cut in the key money market rate to 6.75 percent.</p>
<p>"It makes sense to take some profits or get some insurance at least," he said. "The risk premia in Italy and Spain have now been removed, leaving them with no cushion and very vulnerable."</p>
<p>He said any suggestion from Germany that there was doubt over EMU entry for the high-yielders would "throw a bucket of cold water" over the rally.</p>
<p>The broker said the market was now looking for weak U.S. non-farm payroll figure on Friday. The forecast was for a rise of 166,000 in September, and an unemployment rate of 5.2 percent compared with 5.1 percent in August.</p>
<p>"If the figure is any more than that, the European markets will turnaround very quickly," the broker said. "I don't think this rally can be sustained in the face of a weakening U.S. bond market."</p>
