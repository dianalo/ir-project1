<p>A government expert said Tuesday that the $4 billion merger between Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc. would raise prices to consumers by as much as 10 percent.</p>
<p>"Even after taking into account the potential for efficiencies, this merger can be expected to lead to a large and significant increase in the price of office supplies," said Frederick Warren-Boulton, a witness for the Federal Trade Commission, which is challenging the merger of the two office superstore chains.</p>
<p>He said the probable price increase was "about 6 percent ... 5 percent to 10 percent is a safe range."</p>
<p>Boulton's testimony came on the second day of a five-day hearing to provide evidence for U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Hogan to decide whether to permit the merger, which was challenged as anti-competitive by a 3-2 vote of the FTC.</p>
<p>Warren-Boulton, a Princeton-trained economist who worked in the Justice Department as chief antitrust economist in the Reagan administration, said he had several kinds of evidence to back his findings, including internal company documents.</p>
<p>The government on Monday offered evidence based on Staples and Office Depot documents showing prices were lower in cities with two or three competing office superstores than in cities with just one, a contention challenged by the defence.</p>
<p>But the FTC's Warren-Boulton testified Tuesday that economic theory supported the evidence.</p>
<p>During his cross-examination of Warren-Boulton, Staples attorney Don Kempf tried to show that antitrust theory did not apply in this situation. Kempf noted that there are many towns in the United States without office superstores.</p>
<p>Earlier, Warren-Boulton likened the office superstore market to the grocery supply market. He said while he might shop for groceries at warehouse discounter Price-Costco, convenience stores and small independent groceries as well as Safeway and its Washington regional competitor, Giant, the two supermarkets were in a category by themselves.</p>
<p>He said the existence of the other stores would not justify permitting the merger of Safeway and Giant.</p>
<p>Judge Hogan has said he will rule on the case by mid-June.</p>
