<p>European Union grain plantings are expected to rise 2.2 pct to 37 million hectares in 1997/98 (July/June), Coceral, the EU grain trade lobby forecast on Friday.</p>
<p>It put soft wheat sowings 2.0 percent higher at 14.03 million ha and barley 2.8 pct up at 11.66 million ha.</p>
<p>In its first forecast for the total EU 1997/98 grain area, Coceral saw the maize area 0.9 percent higher at 4.11 million ha and the durum wheat area 2.0 pct up at 3.02 million ha.</p>
<p>The increase in plantings follows a halving of the set-aside rate to five percent in 1997/98.</p>
<p>Rye was seen 1.2 pct higher at 1.34 million ha but oats was seen down 1.8 pct at 1.91 million ha.</p>
<p>The balance is made up of triticale and sorghum.</p>
