<p>Greece's pension system, like its whole social security system, is in dire straights and the government will open talks with unions and employers this year to marshall support for a major overhaul to ensure its future viability.</p>
<p>"We want to start a dialogue with various social partners in February to sort out this problem which is like a time bomb threatening our society's foundations," said Labour Minister Miltiadis Papaioannou recently.</p>
<p>With an ageing population, rising unemployment and social security debts piling up, the need to reform the system is enormous. Changes made by the former conservative government in the early 1990s helped but much more is needed, industry experts say.</p>
<p>The reforms went some way towards cutting pension fund deficits. The then government raised pensionable age and contributions and abolished an early retirement option for employees at some state owned companies.</p>
<p>This improved pension funds finances and some of them began to show surpluses, but the impact of the reforms has begun to fade.</p>
<p>"We are aware of the fact that this is a multi-dimensional problem whose solutions are painful," said a union leader who requested anonymity. "The demographic problem and high unemployment just complicate things more."</p>
<p>The birth rate has fallen far below the minimum reproduction rate of 2.14 children per woman to keep the population growing. Unemployment is still high at 9.8 percent of the work force in 1996 after 10 percent in 1995 and 9.6 percent in 1994.</p>
<p>"The solutions are known," the union leader said. "Either increase social insurance fees or raise the pension age or change the method of calculating pension funds to save money."</p>
<p>The weekly newspaper Vima said recently a national economy ministry committee set up to propose ways to cure the system's problems recommended that the pensions of civil servants be based on 60 percent of their salary instead of 80 percent now and the pensionable age ceiling be raised to 65 years for everybody.</p>
<p>Problems are being compounded by early voluntary retirement schemes used by the government to fight unemployment.</p>
<p>The union leader said pension funds should be streamlined and this required better management that would cut costs, raise revenues and group pension funds insuring workers of the same business sector.</p>
<p>Greece has more than 160 state pension funds of different kinds. Union leaders have urged that the various funds serving particular economic sectors be merged to form single, large funds.</p>
<p>Some analysts have suggested forming just one or very few pension funds to cover all workers in the country but this is vehemently opposed by social groups whose funds are in better shape than those they will be merged into.</p>
<p>Pensions are low in general but some funds seem to be paying higher pensions although their insured members pay much less in fees.</p>
<p>The Social Insurance Foundation (IKA), a health and pension fund, is the largest in Greece insuring more than 1.8 million people. The Organisation of Agricultural Security (OGA) insures more than 1.1 million.</p>
<p>The socialist government passed legislation recently to make OGA a fully-fledged health and pension fund. It has been subsidised to the tune of tens of billions of drachmas and requiring farmers to pay a monthly fee to enjoy a pension later on.</p>
<p>But its plan to have IKA provide medical services to all farmers has already drawn the fire of many people from current IKA pensioners to union leaders.</p>
<p>"You cannot ask IKA with its present infrastructure to provide medical services to farmers," said the union leader. "This is absurd. It leads to the deterioration of medical services for everybody."</p>
