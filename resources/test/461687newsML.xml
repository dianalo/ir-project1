<p>House Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach laid out his strategy for getting his committee to agree on a financial services reform bill despite significant disagreements on the issue of mixing banking and commerce.</p>
<p>Most on the committee already agree current laws should be scrapped and banks should be allowed to combine with other financial service providers, such as insurance companies or securities firms. But there is little consensus about going farther and allowing unrestricted mixing of financial and commercial companies.</p>
<p>One bill introduced in Congress would allow a financial firm to conduct up to 25 percent of its activity in non-financial businesses. Another bill sets no limits. And a bill introduced by Leach, Republican of Iowa, would allow the investment banking operations of companies to hold 7.5 percent of their assets in stock of commercial companies</p>
<p>Leach has been a strong opponent of allowing broad mixing of banking and commerce but in recent speeches he had hinted at a possible compromise, allowing banks be mimimally involved in commercial activities.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters here Saturday after a speech to the Independent Bankers Association of America, Leach explained that his suggestions were mainly tactical. He said he would not quash a bill in committee that allowed a mimimal amount of mixing, such as allowing a bank to have a "basket" of five to 10 percent of its capital invested in nonfinancial activities.</p>
<p>But Leach made clear he would support such a measure only to get a bill out of committee to the House floor for a full vote. At that point, he would likely offer amendments to prohibit all mixing.</p>
<p>"I do not favor any basket," Leach told reporters. "If it's a capital-based very small basket I'm willing to go along (in committee) but I reserve the right to seek amendment on the House floor."</p>
<p>A majority of committee members might support such an approach, allowing the bill to go forward, he said. "In a way, it's kind of a rearguard action," he said. "I would prefer nothing."</p>
