<p>Norway's central bank, after spending almost four weeks squeezing short-term interest rates higher, finally flexed its muscles on Wednesday and announced a rise in official rates.</p>
<p>Norges Bank increased both the deposit and overnight lending rates by 0.25 percentage points to 3.5 percent and 5.5 percent respectively. The rise was effective immediately.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Jens Stoltenberg said the rate increase was a necessary adjustment to maintain a stable crown. "It is nothing dramatic," he told the NTB news agency.</p>
<p>The central bank said in a statement: "Central Bank governor Kjell Storvik points out that the operational goal for monetary and exchange-rate policy is a stable exchange rate against European currencies and that the decision was made in response to recent developments in money and foreign exchange markets."</p>
<p>Norway's monetary policy is geared towards stabilising the crown versus European currencies. In January the bank cut interest rates twice in two days after massive intervention in the forex market failed to dampen a surging crown.</p>
<p>Since then the petrocurrency has fallen more than eight percent against the inverse European Currency Unit (ECU) index as investors have become increasingly nervous over inflation, the outcome of the parliamentary election in September and weaker oil prices.</p>
<p>To try to stabilise the crown, Norges Bank at the end of June began setting a series of fixed interest rates for its fixed-term deposits. The bank usually carries out deposits through ordinary auction.</p>
<p>This pushed up short-term money market rates more than 65 basis points, but failed to significantly support the crown, which has been trading in a range between 102.95 and 103.75 against the ECU index.</p>
<p>Analysts said the hike had appeared increasingly likely given the crown's continued weakness. However, the bank had been expected to come under pressure from the Labour minority government not to raise rates ahead of the election.</p>
<p>"Today Norway's central bank has gained credibility. We thought it was constrained politically but it has shown it can act alone," said a London-based analyst.</p>
<p>"Norway's Achilles Heel over the last six months has been its inability to tighten monetary policy. The rate rise really does underline the bank's commitment to fight inflation. It is very bullish for Norway," he said.</p>
<p>Given recent polls showing dwindling support for the Labour Party, political uncertainty is expected to weigh on the crown and few economists see any likelihood of a strong appreciation. "We might see a temporary rise but it will be difficult to sustain before the elections," said Stephanie Pfeifer, economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell. "Twenty-five (basis) points is not really enough to slow down the economy. If this (today's hike) fails to support the crown then I think we'll see another 25 (basis) points being priced into the market," she said.</p>
<p>Henrik Soerensen, analyst at Unibank in Copenhagen, expected the crown to stabilise between 4.15 and 4.16 versus the mark. At 1020 GMT it stood at 4.1710 to the mark.</p>
<p>Any move above 4.16 could precipitate a second rate rise of 0.25 percentage points later this month or in early August, he said.</p>
<p>"I think Storvik wanted to raise rates (today) by 50 basis points but (Finance Minister) Stoltenberg just wanted 25 because of the elections," Soerensen said.</p>
