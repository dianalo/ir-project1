<p>The U.S. Defence Department said on Wednesday it was striving to find out whether thousands of U.S. troops were harmed during the 1991 destruction of an Iraqi chemical arms dump.</p>
<p>"It is our intention to look at everything we can, and at the end of the day we will let public opinion judge. But we are not ignoring any incident that comes to our attention," a senior defence official told reporters.</p>
<p>"I know there are those assertions out there," the official, who requested anonymity, said. He was referring to widespread criticism that the Pentagon has failed for years to take medical complaints from Gulf War veterans seriously.</p>
<p>"This is really lethal stuff," the official said of the nerve agent sarin, which may have been in a cloud that drifted over more than 15,000 U.S. troops from ammunition destroyed at the Kamisiyah arms depot in southern Iraq in March 1991.</p>
<p>"The primary known symptom is death. There are possible conditions that one could be in short of death," ranging from seizures to watery eyes and runny noses, the official said, but stressed:</p>
<p>"At this time we do not have any examples that we know of anybody dying from any potential exposure -- or of any of these sub-acute indications ... we do not have any cases to date."</p>
<p>He called the recent discovery that U.S. troops had destroyed weapons at the Kamisiyah complex "a watershed" in the Pentagon's attempts to find sources of so-called "Gulf War Illness," including complaints ranging from numbness to memory loss.</p>
<p>The issue, in which the Pentagon has denied ignoring complaints of veterans or trying to cover up information, has become a major military and political controversy.</p>
<p>Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said on Tuesday that at least 15,000 and perhaps far more Gulf War veterans might have been exposed to chemical weapons.</p>
<p>The exposure estimate has jumped in recent months from 150 American troops, to 5,000, to more than 15,000. The Pentagon has refused to deny reports that the total could be as high as over 100,000.</p>
<p>The U.S. government, on orders from President Bill Clinton, last year mounted a major effort to resolve medical complaints from as many as 60,000 U.S. Gulf War veterans.</p>
<p>But no common cause has been found.</p>
