<p>Hormel Foods Corp said Monday it had purchased a 21.4 percent interest in Campofrio Alimentacion S.A., a Spanish food company with annual sales of $650 million.</p>
<p>Hormel said the minority stake was purchased for $64.3 million and is its largest overseas investment to date.</p>
<p>The alliance is expected to provide each company with opportunities to introduce and expand product distribution and brand penetration outside its home market, Hormel said in a statement.  </p>
<p>"We look forward both to expanding Hormel Foods products and brands into new markets with Campofrio's involvement, and, in turn, helping Campofrio offer consumers in the U.S. and elsewhere a wider variety of its products," said Joel Johnson, Hormel chairman and president, in a statement.</p>
<p>In addition to owning plants in Spain, Campofrio operates food processing plants in Russia, the Dominican Republic, Argentina and the Philippines. Campofrio, based in Madrid, has more than 1,500 employees worldwide and distributes products in Europe, South America and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Hormel produces refrigerated and shelf-stable meat food products and other food products.</p>
