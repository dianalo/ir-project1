<p>France Telecom said on Monday that it was looking for an Asian partner to join the Global One alliance with Deutsche Telekom and Sprint Corp.</p>
<p>Gerard Moine, director of external affairs, told a telephone conference on the World Trade Organisation (WTO) telecoms pact that this agreement, signed at the weekend, would improve access to Asian markets.</p>
<p>"There is a clear relationship between economic growth and a rise in telecommunications," Moine said. "It is not surprising that a large part of the future growth in telecommunications will be in countries with high economic growth, like in Asia.</p>
<p>"We will have the possibility to leave the transatlantic characted of our alliance and become a real global operator," Moine said about Global One.</p>
<p>"We are effectively looking for somebody who can help us to develop our activities more easily in Asia," he said in reply to a question.</p>
<p>Moine said the company was studying whether it wanted many small local partners or a bigger regional partner.</p>
<p>Asked whether Japan's NTT , one of the world's biggest operators currently courted by many parties including British Telecom Plc, could become an ally, Moine did not exclude the possibility.</p>
<p>"It is difficult to strike an alliance with NTT, which is very big and powerful," he said.</p>
<p>"But we do not exclude any partnership in principle. It has to be seen in the light of the basic rule -- what does a potential partner bring in, in exchange for a role in the decision making process."</p>
<p>France Telecom also wants to extend its activities in Latin America, where it is already active in Argentina and Mexico, but Moine did not say the group needed an ally for that region.</p>
<p>He said that in Asia, China would become an unavoidable market but for the moment the country was not included in the WTO deal.</p>
<p>Moine said that while up to now France Telecom could have access to a slice of 17 to 20 percent of the international telecoms market, estimated at $660 billion in 1996, it would now have access to over 90 percent of a market estimated at $800 million. This could grow to $1,200 billion in 2000.</p>
<p>"It is a very important pact and a long awaited pact, especially after the failure of April last year," Moine said.</p>
<p>"It is very important for an operator of a size like France Telecom, a European operator, that is an operator based in a market that will be opened up to competition from January 1, 1998, to have the benefit in the entire world of the same facilities given by Europe and France from next year," he said.</p>
<p>But he added France Telecom would not go abroad just to compensate for a loss of revenues in France due to heavy competition there.</p>
<p>"We intend to keep an important part in the French market. We will be operating in a context where the French and international markets are growing," Moine added.</p>
