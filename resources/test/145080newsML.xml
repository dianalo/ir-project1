<p>Trading in A and B shares of conglomerate Shenzhen Gintian Industry Co Ltd was suspended on Friday afternoon pending an announcement by the company, the Shenzhen bourse said in a notice.</p>
<p>Trading will resume on Monday morning, it said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Gintian told the Hong Kong-based newsletter China Securities Bulletin there had been widespread rumours about Gintian lately, which led to a steep rise in the price of its A shares in active trading.</p>
<p>"Gintian will make public a notice denying the rumours," the spokesman said. Gintian is a real estate, textile and foreign trade company and one of the best-known stocks on the Shenzhen market.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Gintian's A shares surged 0.69 yuan, or 8.79 percent, to close at 8.54 yuan per share on trade of 38.10 million shares. The counter ended Friday morning at 8.83 yuan on volume of 22.92 million shares.</p>
<p>But Gintian's B shares were little affected by the speculation, ending up HK$0.05 at HK$2.25 on Thursday and closing the Friday morning session at HK$2.28.</p>
