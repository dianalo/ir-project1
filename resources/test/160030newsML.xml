<headline>MCI says it talking to BT on deal.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>MCI Communications Corp. said Friday it has entered talks with British Telecommunications Plc on a possible combination of the two companies.</p>
<p>British Telecom already holds a 20 percent stake in the No. 2 U.S. long distance phone company.  </p>
<p>A spokesman for MCI told Reuters the company expected the talks to be concluded this weekend, although he noted that there were no guarantees an agreement would be reached.</p>
<p>"We have entered into negotations with BT on a possible business combination," the spokesman said, reading from a prepared statement.</p>
<p>MCI's stock jumped $5 to $30.625 on Nasdaq after the CNBC television station reported that the companies were in talks. The exchange later halted trading in the stock.</p>
<p>CNBC television said Lazard Freres, MCI's investment bankers, and Morgan Stanley were working on the deal, which it said could be worth upward of $22 billion.</p>
