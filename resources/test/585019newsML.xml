<p>1997 started poorly for Belgian hamburger chain Quick but the company was confident cost control would help it through what is likely to be a difficult year, the company's managers told newspaper L'Echo in an interview published on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Quick is due to hold its annual shareholders meeting later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"After the events of 1996, we want to be extremely prudent this year," Thomas Meiser and Dominique Eeman were quoted by the newspaper as saying.</p>
<p>"The figures for the first two months of 1997 were bad," Meiser said. "In contrast, April was better than March."</p>
<p>Overall, the situation was flat.</p>
<p>"As we don't expect any pick up in consumption, nor an increase in purchasing power, we must concentrate on optimising logistics, controlling purchasing costs...as well as managing expenses of head office services...We have succeeded in reducing our costs by six percent," Meisser said.</p>
<p>The two men said the company was focusing on building a new type of outlet, which was thirty percent less expensive than previous types, in areas where it was not yet present. These included smaller Belgian cities and towns across the border in the Netherlands.</p>
