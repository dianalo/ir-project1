<p>Some Singapore bunker suppliers raised their offers slightly on Tuesday following buying demand in the physical market and firmer fuel oil swaps, traders said.</p>
<p>But some said they maintained previous levels as demand did not improve. "You can only raise prices by $1 per tonne if you don't want to scare buyers away," said one supplier.</p>
<p>The 380-cst grade was quoted at $98/$99 while MDO and gas oil were quoted at $172/$175 and $182/$183 per tonne respectively.</p>
