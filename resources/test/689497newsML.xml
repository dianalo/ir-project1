<p>The Walt Disney Co. pulled about 100,000 copies of an obscenity-laced rap album only six hours after releasing it to stores.</p>
<p>The company declined to comment whether the move on Tuesday was prompted by a recently launched boycott by Southern Baptists to protest what they called Disney's tolerance of gay lifestyles.</p>
<p>The album, "The Great Milenko" by the band Insane Clown Posse, was released and recalled Tuesday.</p>
<p>"When the lyrics of Insane Clown Posse album were brought to the attention of senior management, the decision was made that they were inappropriate for a product released under any label of our company," Disney's Hollywood Records said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, our internal review process did not initially flag the album and allowed it to proceed," the statement said.</p>
