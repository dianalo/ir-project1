<p>Chinese police have detained veteran dissident Wang Donghai, the New York-based pressure group Human Rights in China said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Police in Hangzhou, capital of the eastern province of Zhejiang, told Wang's family that Wang would be sent to a study class, a euphemism for coercive ideological reform, the group said.</p>
<p>Police gave no reason for detaining Wang on Friday and would not let his family meet him or say where he was being held, the group said.</p>
<p>Police also would not say why Wang was being sent to a study class -- a holdover from the chaotic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution -- or say when he would be released, the group said.</p>
<p>Wang's family and Hangzhou police could not be reached for immediate comment.</p>
<p>The group demanded Wang's release and said his detention was a dangerous signal China was returning to its Cultural Revolution days.</p>
<p>Last month, Wang, 45, a veteran dissident of the 1979 Democracy Wall movement, was ordered to serve one year of "re-education through labour", but released because of poor health.</p>
<p>Re-education through labour is an administrative punishment with a maximum of three years that can be imposed by police without recourse to prosecutors or the courts.</p>
<p>Wang was jailed for two years for organising street protests after the military crushed pro-democracy demonstrations by students at Beijing's Tiananmen Square on June 4, 1989, with heavy loss of life.</p>
<p>Chinese authorities appeared to be using administrative punishment more frequently to take dissidents out of circulation without having to go through a more complicated judicial process to impose criminal sentences, Western diplomats have said.</p>
