<p>Kabul's Taleban rulers on Wednesday rejected an ultimatum by ousted government forces to abandon the capital, and said they had no plans to evacuate the city.</p>
<p>Acting information minister Amir Khan Mutaqi told Reuters the Taleban had enough forces to defend the city. He was responding to a reported call by Ahmad Shah Masood to leave the city or face bloodshed.  </p>
<p>Masood was the military chief in the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani. The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) quoted Masood, whose forces have pushed the Taleban back towards Kabul in a dogged offensive this week, as demanding on Tuesday that the purist Islamic movement withdraw from the city or face bloodshed and destruction.</p>
<p>"This type of ultimatum does not have any significance. If it had then we would not have set up our movement," Mutaqi said.</p>
<p>He said that Kabul was peaceful and dismissed Masood's ultimatum as propaganda. He said such calls would not affect the morale of the Taleban movement.</p>
