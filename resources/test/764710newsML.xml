<p>Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc expects sales of its leading drug Lovenox/Clexane to rise in 1997 to US$475-$500 million compared with $400 million in 1996, David Manwaring, general manager and director for Singapore, said on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Michel Lienard, vice president of RPR Asia-Pacific, said the drug was the company's number one product and was in one of the fastest growing markets in the world.</p>
<p>Lovenox/Clexane is used to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) following hip and knee surgery.</p>
<p>When asked what expectations the company had for global sales of the drug in 1997, Manwaring said they would rise to between $475 and $500 million from last year's $400 million.</p>
<p>The officials were speaking at the ground breaking ceremony in Singapore of a bulk chemical factory.  </p>
<p>Building work on the Singapore $75 million (US$51 million) plant will begin in September. The plant is expected to produce enoxaparin sodium -- the active ingredient in Lovenox/Clexane -- from 1999.</p>
<p>Lienard said the market for DVT was one of the fastest growing in the world and was expected to grow to $7.6 billion by 2000, compared with $4.2 billion in 1996.</p>
<p>RPR is 68.3 percent owned by France's Rhone-Poulenc SA, which reported a 14 percent increase in first half profits last week.  </p>
<p>The contribution from RPR fell 9.7 percent to 1.861 billion francs (US$300 million).</p>
