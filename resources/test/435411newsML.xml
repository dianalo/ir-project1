<p>A controversial tax measure approved by California voters last year could prompt many local governments in the state to sell or lease out their public water systems, municipal finance experts said Tuesday.</p>
<p>California's Proposition 218, a statewide initiative approved last November, requires voter approval of an array of taxes, assessments and fees levied by local governments.</p>
<p>Because the tax measure makes it more difficult for them to raise revenues, many municipalities are under pressure to privatise their public utilities, Kevin Civale, a partner with the law firm of Hawkins, Delafield &amp; Wood, told a conference.  </p>
<p>"The reality of (Proposition) 218 may be that you no longer have a choice -- that in order to meet the mandates imposed upon you, you do have to bring in the private sector," Civale told a Standard &amp; Poor's Corp municipal finance conference in San Francisco.</p>
<p>By selling, leasing or contracting out their water systems to private operators, Civale said local governments may be able to sidestep or mitigate the impact of Proposition 218.</p>
<p>He warned, however, that Proposition 218 has yet to be tested in the courts. Future court rulings could expand the tax measure's reach to certain private operators, he said.  </p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty, Civale said Proposition 218 could "accelerate" the privatisation trend in California. He said municipalities can generate revenues from these transactions while cutting down on operating expenses.</p>
<p>Other experts agreed.</p>
<p>An attorney for the California Water Association said many local governments in the state had become "much more inclined to sell" their water systems because of Proposition 218.</p>
<p>"You now have the sellers much more interested in sitting down with the buyers," William Bagley, the association's general counsel, told Reuters at the conference.</p>
<p>Bagley said he was aware of several investor-owned utilities that were in the market to purchase water systems from local governments in the state.</p>
