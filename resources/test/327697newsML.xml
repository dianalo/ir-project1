<p>Discussions on a controversial proposal by Namibia to extract water from the Okavango River before it feeds into the Okavango Delta in Botswana began in the Namibian capital Windhoek on Thursday.</p>
<p>The scheduled two-day talks include representatives from the three-member countries of the Okavango Basin Commission (OKAOM), Namibia, Angola and Botswana, who all have rights to the water.</p>
<p>Hard-up for some relief after a decade-long drought, Namibia has proposed to drain 17 million cubic metres (600 million cubic feet) a year from the river out of a total of 10 billion cubic metres (350 billion cubic feet) that flows into the delta. (Corrects figures.)</p>
<p>Conservationists said however that the plan may now be unnecessary after good rains have fallen over some part of Namibia this year, forcing authorities to open the sluices of the country's biggest reservoir, the Hardap dam.</p>
<p>"I doubt that they will decide to go ahead," Kalahari Conservation Society officer, Keith Leggett, told Reuters in Gaborone.</p>
<p>"This year so far, there have been good rains in Namibia, the dams are filling. It would be more logical for them to continue with the assessment reports, complete a feasibility study ready to go ahead in five year's time," he said.</p>
<p>Water Transfer Consultants Namibia's Andrew Cashman however said the situation in Namibia was still critical.</p>
<p>"At the dams around Windhoek there have been only minor inflows. The situation is still critical," he said.</p>
<p>He added that the situation would be assessed after the rains had stopped -- in February or March. Namibia has undertaken not to take a decision until then.</p>
<p>Cashman said an assessment of the impacts of the proposal on the delta would be ready in March.</p>
<p>Conservationists fear that the tapping of the river - which rises in Angola and flows across Namibia's Caprivi Strip before entering Botswana - will disrupt the delta's unique ecosystem.</p>
<p>At least 75 percent of Botswana's tourism revenues come from the delta, rich in wildlife.</p>
