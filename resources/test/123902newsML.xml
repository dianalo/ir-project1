<title>USA: Jury chosen for O.J. Simpson civil trial.</title>
<headline>Jury chosen for O.J. Simpson civil trial.</headline>
<dateline>SANTA MONICA, Calif. 1996-10-17</dateline>

<p>A jury was chosen Thursday to hear the civil lawsuit brought against O.J. Simpson by families of his ex-wife and her friend, of whose murders he was acquitted in criminal court last year.</p>
<p>After questioning of more than 200 potential jurors, Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki swore in a panel of seven women and five men. He said opening arguments would start next Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Questioning was continuing Thursday to pick eight alternate jurors who could take over if any of the 12 dropped out.</p>
<p>The panel comprised six whites, two blacks and two Hispanics, one person who appeared to be of Middle Eastern origin and one who is part Asian and part black.</p>
<p>The racial makeup of the jury is important since opinion polls have shown Americans divided over the criminal case verdict. Most blacks supported the jury decision and most whites felt Simpson should have been found guilty.</p>
<p>Unlike a criminal trial, the jury in a civil case does not have to reach a unanimous verdict, but can find in favor of either side with a 9-3 majority. The jury verdict may be reached on the basis of "a preponderance of evidence" rather than the stricter "beyond a reasonable doubt" of a criminal case.</p>
