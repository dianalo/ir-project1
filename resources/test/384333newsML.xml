<p>Albanian President Sali Berisha has launched a charm offensive to win back popular support from angry investors who lost heavily in fraudulent pyramid schemes.</p>
<p>Europe's poorest country has been swept by protests and riots for the past month after tens of thousands of investors lost large sums of money in the failed get-rich-quick schemes.</p>
<p>The ruling free-market Democrats have been blamed by many investors for failing to regulate the schemes and for failing to warn investors, who are new to capitalism, of the risks.</p>
<p>After lying low for weeks, Berisha launched his campaign to win back support, admitting that he made mistakes but calling on investors to take their share of the blame for gambling on the dubious schemes.</p>
<p>"I came to you to admit errors and mistakes by the ruling goverment, the party and by me," he said in the southern town of Lushnje on Tuesday. "But I am open and I can tell you the people are also to blame."</p>
<p>He started addressing the meetings of carefully selected supporters in the capital of Tirana on Saturday and then moved to Lushnje, which was rocked by riots last month.</p>
<p>Barisha, elected by parliament to a five-year term in 1992, told reporters he would visit the other southern trouble spots -- Fier and Vlore -- soon for similar meetings.</p>
<p>He has steadfastly said that the government would not pay compensation for some $1 billion to $2 billion lost in five collapsed pyramid schemes in January.</p>
<p>But in Lushnje he trotted out a string of promises to try to woo support, from declaring the region a free trade zone to speeding privatisation of telecommunications, industry and petrol.</p>
<p>He even promised to help out the local soccer team, drawing huge applause from the audience. The Lushnje club was sponsored by Pellumb Xhaferri, the detained chief manager of one of the collapsed pyramid schemes.</p>
<p>Most striking, he declared that he was removing all taxes for two years for residents in the area to help them recover after losing large sums of money to the pyramid schemes.</p>
<p>"I ordered the finance minister to lift taxes for two years in Lushnje to help farmers and citizens out of this crisis," he said.</p>
<p>Berisha entered the local theatre to applause and chants of "Sali Berisha" but he was booed by a number of onlookers in the streets when he left 90 minutes later. A rock was hurled at his car as he drove off, one eyewitness said.</p>
<p>Police imposed heavy security for his visit. Plainclothes police swarmed over the town centre. Armed guards were perched on rooftops overlooking the main square and police told drivers they could not park nearby.</p>
<p>Facing a month of nationwide riots and protests, Berisha appealed for people to remember what Albania was like just five years ago after 45 years under a ruthless Stalinist regime, isolated from almost all other countries, until 1990.</p>
<p>"I understand we are talking about big losses. But do not forget what your lives were like five years ago. Now you are four times better than you were then," he said.</p>
<p>The next test of Berisha's popularity may come on Thursday when Albanians commemorate the toppling of the statue of Enver Hoxha, the country's communist dictator for 40 years.</p>
<p>The ruling Democratic party has called a rally in Tirana but opposition groups have also called on their supporters to demonstrate on that day.</p>
