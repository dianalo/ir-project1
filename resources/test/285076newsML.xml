<p>The BBC said Friday it chose a consortium headed by Castle Tower Corporation of Houston, Texas, as the preferred bidder for its domestic television and radio transmission business.</p>
<p>The BBC and the CTC consortium expect to sign a contract for the sale, which analysts estimate could raise up to 200 million pounds ($340 million), by the end of the month.</p>
<p>The BBC, which derives most of its revenues from an annual licence fee payable by all British television set owners, will use the proceeds to help finance its move into new digital services.</p>
<p>"This will help fund the BBC going into a much more competitive era," BBC Deputy Director-General Bob Phillis told Reuters.</p>
<p>Castle Tower, the consortium's managing partner, operates more than 1,200 wireless and broadcast communication sites throughout the United States and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>The CTC consortium also includes TeleDiffusion de France, a subsidiary of the France Telecom Group, plus investment firms Candover Investments Plc and Berkshire Partners.</p>
<p>Assets included in the sale include freeholds and leaseholds in relation to 740 transmitter sites across the country, including equipment, and contracts with some 500 staff.</p>
<p>The consortium will be granted a 10-year contract to transmit BBC domestic analogue television and radio services.</p>
<p>Friday's announcement is a boost for the BBC as it seeks to expand its programming in the multi-channel digital future. It is planning to offer all licence payers supplementary digital channels and a 24-hour television news service.</p>
