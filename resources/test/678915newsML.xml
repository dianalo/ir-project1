<p>Beijing's state-owned People's Insurance Co of China plans to underwrite the Shanghai Haixin Shipping Co to the value of 1.4 billion yuan ($169 million) from July 1, the Business News said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The policy would cover 76 cargoes owned by Haixin, China's only shipping firm listed in Hong Kong, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The insurance would provide a safety net for Haixin, which carries 80 percent of Shanghai and East China's energy and ore needs, it said.</p>
<p>It would also have a stabilising effect on H shares, Chinese companies listed on the Hong Kong exchange, it said.</p>
<p>The newspaper gave no details of the cost of the policy to Haixin.</p>
<p>Haixin, a subsidiary of Shanghai Maritime (Group) Co Ltd, has a fleet of more than 180 vessels with combined tonnage of 3.77 million dead-weight tonnes, the official media has said.</p>
