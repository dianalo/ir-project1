<p>Romania's leu ended 50 units lower to 3,660/3,700 against the dollar on Monday on an interbank market slow to digest the package of short-term measures announced by the country's Prime Minister-designate Victor Ciorbea.</p>
<p>"So far, there was no reaction (to the programme) on the market. We are struggling to cope with the prolonged hard currency squeezes," said one trader.</p>
<p>Ciorbea and ministers he designated on Monday have not yet won parliamentary approval for a six-month programme aimed at improving living standards and correct economic imbalances.</p>
<p>Interbank traders said they were waiting for more details on the programme and predicted a quicker depreciation of the leu against the dollar in coming days.</p>
<p>"One may witness a leu-dollar at 4,000 by the end of the year. Rates for other currencies offer at cross a leu-dollar of some 4,300, and this is close to...(a rate at which) might be an incentive rate for exporters to sell," said another trader.</p>
<p>Latest data showed interbank trading of $5.85 million on Friday, when overall trading amounted to $31.3 million.</p>
<p>Operators said exporters were still holding onto their dollars, awaiting better prices before Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>The leu lurked near 4,800 to the dollar on the retail market, with currency shop managers saying they were expecting it to hit the 5,000-treshhold amid rising dollar demand.</p>
<p>One-week money market rates edged up on Monday when some major banks were keen to get leu funds. Prices traded from 44 to 49 percent against some 41 percent last week. -- Mirela Eremia, Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264</p>
