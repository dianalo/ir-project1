<p>Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and 10 other ruling party members have filed eight individual and joint defamation suits against Workers' Party leader Joshua Jeyaretnam, the Straits Times said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The newspaper had earlier reported that the group of ruling People's Action Party (PAP) leaders were suing the veteran opposition politician for allegedly defaming them, but the number of suits had not been specified.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs were not immediately available for comment. Jeyaretnam was also unavailable. Since Singapore's general election on January 2, in which the ruling PAP won 81 of 83 parliamentary seats, leading PAP politicians have also issued a total of 12 writs against Workers' Party activist Tang Liang Hong.</p>
<p>In addition, Tang faces a suit brought against him before the election by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and his son, Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.</p>
<p>In the actions against Jeyaretnam, the plaintiffs claim Jeyaretnam used words at a Workers' Party rally on January 1 to allege they were guilty of criminal defamation and conspiracy and lacked honesty and integrity.</p>
<p>The Straits Times reported earlier that Jeyaretnam had offered to apologise to the plaintiffs but had denied that he had used defamatory words.</p>
<p>Jeyaretnam and Tang were candidates on a Workers' Party slate during the election in a hotly contested multi-member constituency.</p>
<p>They lost, but Jeyaretnam will take a seat in parliament anyway under a constitutional provision for a seat for best-loser if only two opposition members are elected to parliament.</p>
<p>Jeyaretnam made history in 1981 when he won a by-election and became the first opposition member elected to Parliament since independence in 1965. He retained the seat in the 1984 general election.</p>
<p>Troubles started for him shortly after he was re-elected.</p>
<p>In November 1986, the high court sentenced Jeyaretnam and Wong Hong Toy, then chairman of the Workers' Party to one month's imprisonment and a fine of S$5,000 (US$3,550) each on charges of making false statements about the party's accounts.</p>
<p>The conviction both disqualified Jeyaretnam from serving in Parliament and barred him from recontesting for five years.</p>
<p>But, appealing against the conviction to the Privy Council in London, Jeyaretnam on November 21, 1988, won a widely publicised condemnation of what had happened.</p>
<p>When the two petitioned President Wee Kim Wee for a pardon on the council's advice, the request was turned down.</p>
