<p>Skating fever gripped the Netherlands on Friday ahead of only the 15th staging of the historic 200-kilometre (125-mile) Elfstedentocht (Eleven Cities Tour) skating marathon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Over a million fans and skating enthusiasts are expected to travel to the northern province of Friesland to watch up to 16,000 skaters take part in the legendary race.</p>
<p>National television will broadcast the event live with pre-race commentary from 5.00am (0400 GMT).</p>
<p>Eager skaters wanting to register for the race began queueing in the Friesian capital of Leeuwarden in the early hours of Friday.</p>
<p>The first arrival, a 48-year-old Friesian wearing clogs, was rewarded with race number 9107.</p>
<p>"That's a nice number. I get to start at half past seven (0630 GMT) on Saturday," Douwe de Jong said.</p>
<p>Some 300 top skaters will be freed from steel cages at the 5.30am (0430 GMT) start and will expect to complete the gruelling course along a maze of canals and inland waterways through 10 mediaeval towns in about seven hours.</p>
<p>The bulk of the skaters will then be released at 15-minute intervals. Many will not return to Leeuwarden much before midnight.</p>
<p>Emergency services in Leeuwarden were bracing themselves for the arrival of hundreds of thousands of skating fans.</p>
<p>Some 500 police have been drafted in to control crowds of onlookers and well-wishers and the town's hospital was preparing for an influx of casualties from frostbite and drunkenness. Temperatures were expected to slump to around minus 15 degrees Celsius (five degrees Fahrenheit).</p>
<p>Hotels and guest houses throughout the region were fully booked, with bars planning to stay open all night.</p>
<p>The organisers expect a media "circus" of some 2,000 journalists and camera crews. Dozens of extra buses and trains have been laid on. Roads into Leeuwarden were to be closed at 7.00pm (1800 GMT) on Friday.</p>
<p>Hundreds of local entrepreneurs have cashed in on the impromptu party atmosphere, with booming sales of Elfstedentocht T-shirts.</p>
<p>Unox, part of the Anglo-Dutch Unilever household products giant, said it would provide, free, over 20,000 bowls of traditional Dutch pea soup to those taking part.</p>
<p>A local insurer has offered free accident cover to all skaters, with next-of-kin receiving 10,000 guilders if their loved ones die during the race.</p>
<p>Temporary job agencies, complaining that hardly anyone wants to work during the historic race, have been unable to meet huge demand for sandwichmakers, tent builders and stewards.</p>
<p>The race, the first for 11 years, has been given the green light this year after Europe's big freeze guaranteed that ice along the route was at least 15 cms (six inches) deep.</p>
<p>During the last two tours, in 1985 and 1986, parliament went into recess and Queen Beatrix cut short her foreign holiday. Heir to the throne Prince Willem Alexander skated in the race in 1986.</p>
<p>This year, the royal family will continue their holiday in Africa, but Dutch cabinet ministers have rushed to attend.</p>
<p>The 1963 "Tour of Tours" was an epic which gave the event its mythical status. Only 126 of almost 10,000 skaters fought their way through a blizzard to the finishing line.</p>
