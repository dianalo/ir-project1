<p>A French bar owner was killed in a late night shooting in the Cambodian capital, police and diplomats said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A French diplomat said the man, Eric Ambroise, had been shot outside a bar next to the Wat Phnom, a small hilltop temple from which the capital partly takes its name.</p>
<p>Police and embassy officials said Ambroise, who was about 40 years old, was shot once in each arm and twice in the head late on Wednesday as he was getting into his car. He was dead on arrival at Calmette Hospital, doctors said.</p>
<p>French residents said Ambroise was from Avignon, and was part owner of a Phnom Penh bar called Cactus.</p>
<p>Police said they were starting an investigation but would not indicate possible motives.</p>
<p>The shooting came on the eve of a visit by Margie Sudre, French secretary of state for francophone affairs, who is paying a four-day official visit to Cambodia.</p>
<p>She was scheduled to meet Queen Monineath and co-Premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh and attend events at a Southeast Asian film festival in the capital.</p>
