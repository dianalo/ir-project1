<p>Ukraine is considering increasing the 1997 budget deficit level agreed with the International Monetary Fund, but economists said on Tuesday the move would not necessarily crush hopes for a big new loan.</p>
<p>"It might hurt talks with the IMF, but I am hopeful the mission will leave Kiev having agreed measures with Ukraine," Rafal Antszak, of the Harvard Institute for International Development, said.</p>
<p>"The IMF has not yet agreed to raise the deficit target. It could be a problem but the IMF might change its mind," said a Western economist who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>They were responding to comments at the weekend by President Leonid Kuchma's aide on the economy, Valery Litvitski, who said the former Soviet republic might increase its 3.8 percent deficit by up to one percentage point.</p>
<p>Economists say 3.8 percent is the level agreed by the IMF, whose mission is in Kiev to review the next tranche of an $876 million stand-by loan and discuss a $2.5-$3.0 billion Extended Fund Facility due to replace the stand-by loan.</p>
<p>An IMF official said on Saturday said he was hopeful Kiev would get the loan soon, and Litvitski said the two sides had "understood each other very well" on all issues at talks so far.</p>
<p>The 3.8 percent figure approximated to three percent by Western standards, Central Bank Chief Viktor Yushchenko said.</p>
<p>The Western economist said the IMF mission, which began work on Wednesday and is due to leave on November 12, had not agreed to any deficit increase at the weekend.</p>
<p>"Current revenue levels don't cover expenditure and they are seriously looking at expenditure cuts. It's a fluid situation. The cabinet ministers are aware of the shortfall," he said.</p>
<p>Litvitski said on Saturday that Ukraine would use methods like Treasury bill issues to avoid pushing up inflation.</p>
<p>"If it does not hurt economic reforms we will reserve the possibility of an insignificant increase -- no more than one percent -- in the budget deficit compared to the data agreed in our economic memoranda," he said.</p>
<p>A big source of cash could be Eurobond issues, which Deputy Prime Minister in charge of the economy, Viktor Penzenyk, said last week could raise hundreds of millions of dollars in 1997.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Valentyn Koronevsky has said the government would also issue four billion hyrvnias in Treasury bills, 3.3 billion of which would be to repay paper issued in 1996.</p>
<p>"They are interested in containing inflation and they don't want to print more money, so they could sell more bonds or achieve more bilateral financing," the Western economist said.</p>
<p>Kuchma and his government face a tough time balancing the demands of the IMF and keeping the population happy.</p>
<p>Millions of elderly people live on pensions as low as the equivalent of about $20 a month and the government owes 3.3 billion hyrvnias in wages and social payments.</p>
<p>"The problem is there is a difference in opinion about how to set the deficit. Some want to reduce taxes and change the deficit, but you have to cut expenditures too," Antszak said.</p>
<p>Kuchma has promised tax reform in 1997 to raise more cash from enterprises who are currently supposed to hand over about 95 percent of profits -- though few actually pay.</p>
<p>But reducing admittedly crippling tax levels too much would lead to further imbalances in the budget, economists said.</p>
<p>"It all depends on how drastic the cuts are. You can't shift the shadow economy in a year...though we could see an improvement by 1998," Antszak said.</p>
