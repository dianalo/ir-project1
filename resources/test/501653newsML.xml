<p>The Thai central bank said on Thursday it fixed the baht at a 10-1/2-year low of 26.10 against the strong dollar.</p>
<p>The Thai unit fell in early dealings and was quoted at 26.105/26.110 in thin early trade against 26.080/26.100 late Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The dollar's rise is putting a little pressure on the baht and its trading above its band ... but trade is a bit quiet with no-one wanting to quote because they fear intervention by the Bank of Japan," said a dealer at Bank of Ayudhya.  </p>
<p>Japanese officials said earlier they were concerned by excessive foreign exchange movements.</p>
<p>Moody's decision to downgrade Thailand's sovereign credit rating on Wednesday had little impact on baht sentiment as it had been widely anticipated by the market, traders said.</p>
<p>"The decision to reduce the credit of the country may make people a little less confident but I don't think its having a big affect because people had discounted it already," he said.</p>
<p>"Thai commercial banks are largely holding their positions...People are watching for possible intervention by the Japanese central bank," said a dealer at Bangkok Bank.  </p>
<p>Liquidity tightened early with the overnight interbank offered rate quoted higher at 9.25-9.75 percent against 8.50-9.00 percent late Wednesday as demand rose ahead of the four-day Thai New Year holiday from this weekend, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Liquidity is a little tighter ahead of the long weekend ... I think the Bank of Thailand will also like see the rates stick higher to help stop possible speculation against the baht," said the dealer at Bangkok Bank.</p>
<p>The one-month dollar baht swap edged higher at 6.50/7.00 satang early Wednesday against 6.00/7.00 late on Wednesday.</p>
