<p>China collected 65.3 billion yuan ($7.87 billion) in industrial and commercial tax in July, up 19.1 percent from a year ago, the China Daily said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The figure includes revenues from an increase in the stamp duty on share trading and a business tax on finance companies introduced in May.</p>
<p>If revenues from the increases were excluded, the increase would only be 8.2 percent year-on-year, the lowest growth rate since January, the newspaper said, quoting officials of the State General Administration of Taxation.</p>
<p>Officials attributed the slowdown to low efficiency in enterprises in the hot summer weather and payment delays.</p>
<p>Domestic consumption tax revenue fell for the first time, down 4.2 percent from a year earlier, and VAT revenue rose only 2.9 percent after averaging 12.9 percent growth in the first half of this year, China Daily said.</p>
<p>Industrial and commercial tax revenues in the first seven months totalled 423 billion yuan, up 68.8 billion yuan from the same 1996 period, it said.</p>
<p>China's industrial and commercial tax revenue target for the year is 695 billion yuan, compared with collections of 644.6 billion yuan last year, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>China collected 12.34 billion yuan in personal income tax in the first half of this year, up 42.5 percent from the same period last year, the Economic Information Daily said.</p>
