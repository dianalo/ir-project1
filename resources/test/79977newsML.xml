<p>Mount Leyshon Gold Mines Ltd expected production to improve to more satisfactory levels in 1996/97 and was soundly positioned for the future, executive chairman Tony Palmer said in the company's annual report.</p>
<p>Palmer said production in 1995/96 reached only 210,704 ounces, 10 percent below forecast, due to falls in throughput and average head grades in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless the year ahead promises a return to the level of performance which we have come to expect from the Mt Leyshon operation," he said in the report.  </p>
<p>"We anticipate being able to access higher grade ore beginning in the second quarter and we are therefore anticipating that production will improve to more satisfactory levels," he said.</p>
<p>Mt Leyshon, 75.6 percent owned by Normandy Mining Ltd, recorded a 16 percent drop in net profit in 1995/96 to A$19.9 million, due to lower gold sales and an increase in mine operating cost to A$354 per ounce, it said.  </p>
<p>Palmer said mine production and performance would be enhanced from late September 1996 with the commissioning of the scats retreatment project, which would recover an additional 8,000 ounces of gold each year and would lower production costs.</p>
<p>"With strong cash flow and a committed regional exploration effort, the company is soundly positioned for the future," he said.</p>
<p>Mt Leyshon said exploration for 1996/97 would be down, at A$3.1 million, on the previous year's A$3.7 million, but be based on a more focused programme.</p>
