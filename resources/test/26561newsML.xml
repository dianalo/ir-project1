<p>After a month-long recess, Congress returns this week for a final effort to pass laws before members leave the capital once again to campaign for re-election in the Nov. 5 poll.</p>
<p>The last session of the 104th Congress will be overshadowed by the presidential campaign, getting its traditional Labour Day start this weekend after the Republican and Democratic national political conventions.</p>
<p>Of course, President Clinton and Republican nominee Bob Dole have been campaigning for months. Now members of Congress are feeling the itch to concentrate on electoral politics.</p>
<p>"Everybody will be in their political partisan mode" this month, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Mississippi republican, predicted before Congress adjourned. An expert on elections said that means not much will be accomplished.</p>
<p>"My guess is they will do the bare minimum they have to do, get out of here and go back and campaign," said Candice Nelson, an American University professor who directs the Campaign Management Institute there.</p>
<p>But Before Congress leaves, late this month or early in October, it must complete work on appopriations bills needed to keep government running.</p>
<p>Polls show the public has blamed Republicans for two government shutdowns in deadlocks over government spending.</p>
<p>In his convention speech Clinton dared them to make another "blackmail threat," promising to resist again. But Republican leaders are anxious to avoid a confrontation that could hurt them and say they will reach agreement with the administration.</p>
<p>Twelve of the 13 spending bills, which together cover about $500 billion in spending for fiscal 1997 starting Oct. 1, remain to be completed. Leaders say if they do not finish, then a stop-gap bill will keep government running.</p>
<p>There is also other business.</p>
<p>This week the Senate will take up the Defence of Marriage bill, passed earlier by the House, which bars federal pension benefits for individuals in same-sex marriages and says states need not recognise such marriages made in other states. Clinton has promised to sign the bill. No state permits such marriages.</p>
<p>Clinton called on Congress to ratify a treaty aimed at banning production, possession or use of chemical weapons. The Senate is expected to vote by Sept. 14 on ratification.</p>
<p>The House will consider bills which are given little chance of becoming law in the near future, but will highlight Republican views for voters.</p>
<p>For example, the House may complete action on a juvenile justice bill which permits children of 13 or 14 to be tried as adults for federal crimes. The bill would also slap a mandatory 20-year sentence on top of other penalties in drug or violent crime cases if a weapon is fired.</p>
<p>The House will also try to override Clinton's veto of a bill banning some late-term abortions. While the effort is expected to fail, it will help underscore the Republican opposition to abortion.</p>
<p>Democrats are also trying to make political points. In his speech, Clinton renewed a call for Congress to expand the government's authority to wiretap and to put chemical markers or taggants in gunpowder, powers he said were needed to fight terrorism. But Republicans have already turned down that request once and no action is expected now.</p>
