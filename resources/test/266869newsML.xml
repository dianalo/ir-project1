<p>Argentina's former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo on Thursday accused House of Deputies leader Alberto Pierri of organising a bizarre protest outside his house, local media said.</p>
<p>It also reported that Pierri would sue Cavallo after the former minister accused him of corruption and of paying for a demonstration on Wednesday outside Cavallo's home in the exclusive Buenos Aires district of Palermo Chico.</p>
<p>In the confused incident, the demonstrators, mainly women and children from poor districts of Buenos Aires, held signs accusing Cavallo of stealing public money and causing unemployment.</p>
<p>Pierri, a member of the governing Peronist Party, was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Since his dismissal by President Carlos Menem in July, Cavallo has peppered the government and judiciary with accusations of graft and has been enmeshed in a series of court cases for his comments.</p>
<p>Speaking on radio, Cavallo accused Pierri of hiding behind his congressional immunity from prosecution.</p>
<p>"Pierri is sheltering behind his congressional privleges. If he did not have them he would be submitted to an investigation for corruption," Cavallo said.</p>
<p>Referring to Pierri's alleged role in Wednesday's protest, Cavallo said, "He organised it outside my house."</p>
<p>One of the protestors later told radio he had been sent by low level officials of the Peronist Party, who promised him help with legal problems in return.</p>
<p>Argentine newspapers mockingly reported that the protestors were offered hotdogs and cheap vegetables and were told they would be protesting the closure of Buenos Aires' central market. Instead they were bused to Cavallo's house and given signs to hold.</p>
<p>Cavallo has launched himself as an alternative political force focusing on a crusade against corruption.</p>
