<p>A California state assemblyman introduced a resolution Monday to bar back-room budget negotiations by the governor and legislative leaders.</p>
<p>Assemblyman Don Perata, a freshman Democrat, presented the resolution to the Assembly rules committee, which referred it to the budget committee. A hearing date has yet to be set.</p>
<p>The resolution would bar closed-door meetings of the so-called "Big Five," a group that includes senior legislative leaders and Gov. Pete Wilson.</p>
<p>The Big Five typically meets in private to negotiate a budget compromise. The budget that emerges is then brought to floors of the Senate and Assembly for enactment.</p>
<p>Critics charge that the Big Five usurps the authority of the Senate and Assembly to make budget decisions.</p>
