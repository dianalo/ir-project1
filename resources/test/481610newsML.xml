<p>The Iraqi government began on Wednesday distributing the first food rations to its citizens under its oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.</p>
<p>"We have waited a long time for the new rations and now we are picking the fruit of our patience. The old rations were not enough for one week," said Um Ghazi, mother of seven children.</p>
<p>Shop owners in Baghdad said residents queued to receive their increased monthly flour rations as first food shipments arrived in the country under a deal permitting Iraq to sell a limited amount of oil to pay for food.</p>
<p>"I received today the new amount of flour which covers about 150 families in my area of distribution and I have started handing it out," said Abu Zeiki, Baghdad food seller.</p>
<p>"Families have been lining up to receive their new quota."</p>
<p>Iraq has faced food shortages since the United Nations imposed trade sanctions on Baghdad for invading Kuwait in 1990.</p>
<p>Under a deal with the United Nations which took effect on December 10, Iraq is allowed to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to meet the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi population.</p>
<p>Food bought by Iraq under the programme supervised by the United Nations started reaching the country last month. A U.N. source said on Monday 90,000 tonnes of food out of an anticipated 2,227,000 tonnes has arrived. He said some 66,402 tonnes of wheat reached Iraq's Umm Qasr port on Monday.</p>
<p>The new flour quota per person is nine kilos (20 lb) of flour a month instead of seven kilos (15.4 lb) which the government, along with other foodstuffs, has been distributing to Iraqis at giveaway prices since the sanctions were imposed.</p>
<p>"Our dreams have come true as I have received the first food item under the oil deal," said Abu Marwan. He said he received 54 kilos of flour for his family of six.</p>
<p>Rations of sugar, cooking oil, rice, pulses and detergents would be increased from May.</p>
<p>Iraqi and U.N. officials say each Iraqi would also be entitled to 2.5 kg (5.5 lb) of rice instead of 1.25 kg (2.75 lb) and two kg (4.4 lb) of sugar instead of 750 grams (1.6 lb).</p>
<p>The United Nations has deployed more than 100 observers to ensure the supplies are fairly distributed.</p>
