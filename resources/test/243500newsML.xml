<p>The Tunisian government on Monday said it would press ahead in 1997 with economic reforms such as speeding privatisation and dismantling customs barriers as part of efforts to integrate into a free-trade zone with the European Union.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hamed Karoui told parliament in his annual budget speech the reforms would help produce 5.7 percent real gross domestic product (GDP) growth next year from 6.9 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>"The realisation of our objectives next year...rests on deepening the structural reforms in a way that boosts the competitivity of our economy...," he said.</p>
<p>"One of the most important reforms (generated by the accord with the EU) will be to take measures related to trade exchanges by dismantling customs barriers as agreed for the accord's second year," Karoui said.</p>
<p>The accord, signed in 1995, calls for the progressive lifting of customs taxes on the entry of EU products and the immediate removal of limits on the quantity of EU-made goods allowed to enter Tunisia.</p>
<p>Under these measures, EU-made capital goods will enter Tunisia free of customs taxes and would pay only 10 percent value added tax (VAT), he said.</p>
<p>The government will improve its recovery of VAT and income tax to limit the resulting loss of customs tax revenue, he added.</p>
<p>In the banking sector, Karoui said the government will facilitate the establishment of factoring firms to help clean up the debts owed by public firms to the banks.</p>
<p>Karoui also said the government will take steps to make Tunis Stock Exchange trading more flexible. He didn't elaborate, but brokers have said they expect the government to make the system of taxing bonds less bureaucratic.</p>
<p>"The process of privatisation and restructuring (of public firms) will be boosted to include, in 1997, an important number of companies. In parallel, the capital of at least five firms will be opened up (to the public)," Karoui said. ($=one dinar)</p>
