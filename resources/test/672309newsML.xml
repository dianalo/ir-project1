<p>South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission on Thursday rejected a demand by the opposition National Party that commission chairman Archbishop Desmond Tutu apologise for his public criticism.</p>
<p>The party, which implemented apartheid in 1948 and began dismantling it four decades later, began a boycott of the commission last month in protest at what it called biased treatment.</p>
<p>It objected to remarks by Tutuand Alex Boraine, his deputy, to the effect that National Party (NP) leader F.W. de Klerk had failed to fully accept that the NP's policies during the apartheid years were responsible for gross human rights abuses.</p>
<p>The party demanded an apology from Tutu and the resignation of Boraine, threatening legal action if the demands were not met.</p>
<p>Tutu, in a statement issued after a meeting of the commission, said an urgent meeting should be held with de Klerk's party to resolve the conflict between them.</p>
<p>"The view of the full commission is that the demands cannot be acceded to," Tutu said.</p>
<p>"The commission believes that if dialogue could bring about a constitutional settlement in South Africa, it should be able to resolve the current difficulties," he said, adding that the truth body would be available for a meeting in Cape Town until Friday.</p>
<p>The National Party had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>The truth commission was set up in 1995 to probe human rights abuses by all sides during apartheid, in the hopes that revealing the truth would help to heal the wounds of the past and promote reconciliation.</p>
