<p>Refinery repairs kept U.S. West Coast products steady despite a fall in NYMEX prices early Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>Milder forecasts for the northeast U.S., a key heating oil region, initially weighed down energy futures before a slight rebound in late New York trade.</p>
<p>January heating oil fell as much 1.39 cents a gallon to 72.15 cents, while gasoline shed 1.17 cents amid the weather news and talk of profit-taking.</p>
<p>Early West Coast spot trade was active but stable despite the volatile futures, traders said.  </p>
<p>A recent spate of refinery problems in California left perceptions of tighter supplies among traders.</p>
<p>Damaged units include:</p>
<p>- A fluid catalytic cracker at Chevron's Richmond plant, slated to return December 25 following an early December tube problem.</p>
<p>- A hydrocracker shut Dec. 7 for an unspecified period at Unocal's Wilmington refinery.</p>
<p>- Lost output from two cokers damaged in a late November fire at Mobil's Torrance refinery.</p>
<p>West Coast dealers bought and sold December gasoline for the fourth cycle, traders said.</p>
<p>December CARB gasoline was talked between 71 and 72 cents a gallon in Los Angeles, easing a half cent from late Tuesday as local tightness offset sharp NYMEX declines.</p>
<p>CARB-grade gasoline for January was also talked about 0.50 cent lower at 73/74 cents a gallon, with a parcel sold in L.A. for 74 cents.</p>
<p>December barrels of conventional gasoline eased 0.50 cent to 70/71 cents in the L.A. market.</p>
<p>January CARB diesel was nearly flat from Tuesday at 73/74 cents a gallon, with December trade ended. Low sulphur diesel sold for 70.50 cents, even with yesterday, traders said.</p>
<p>In Portland, Oregon conventional unleaded gasoline was bought at 64.50 cents, brokers said.</p>
