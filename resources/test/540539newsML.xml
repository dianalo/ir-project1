<p>U.N. envoy for Western Sahara James Baker arrived in Algiers on Friday on a North Africa tour to relaunch the U.N. peace plan in the disputed territory, the official APS news agency said.</p>
<p>"The visit in the region will enable James Baker to make suggestions to the U.N. secretary general on the necessity of applying or not the deadlocked peace plan in the territory," APS said.</p>
<p>Baker was received at Algiers airport by Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf, the agency said.</p>
<p>The former U.S. Secretary of State was appointed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last month to try to resolve the dispute over the former Spanish colony. It is claimed by Morocco while the Algerian-backed Polisario Front seeks independence there.</p>
<p>The U.N. envoy arrived in Algiers from Morocco where he held talks with King Hassan II, government officials and leaders of political parties on the U.N. peace plan and latest developments in the region, officials said.</p>
<p>A ceasefire in the Western Sahara, monitored by a U.N. force, has held since September 1991. But plans for a U.N. referendum on the future of the territory have been stalled since January 1992 over who is eligible to vote.</p>
<p>The U.N. envoy, touring North Africa in a Spanish military airplane, will also visit Tindouf, the Polisario's rear base located in southern Algeria and Mauritania.</p>
