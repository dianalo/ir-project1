<p>A fire raged through 16 wooden houses in northeastern Taiwan early on Thursday, killing five people, Taiwan police said.</p>
<p>One person was critically injured. The blaze, which started after midnight, burned 14 of the houses to the ground before firefighters arrived.</p>
<p>The five dead were found in the living room of one of the houses.</p>
<p>"The wooden material of the houses made it very easy for the fire to spread, and all the houses were right next to each other," a fire official said.</p>
<p>The police estimated financial losses at T$5 million (US$180,000). They said arson was unlikely, but the cause of the fire has not been determined.</p>
