<p>NOTE - Full name of the German engineering and telecommunications group is Mannesmann AG. The company said its automotive and especially its telecommunications divisions improved earnings last year while its engineering division earned only a "very small profit" due to a heavy loss at its Demag subsidiary. The tubes and trading division made a loss in 1996, Mannesmann said. Tax payments increased in 1996.</p>
<p>Group sales rose eight percent. Adjusted for changes to the consolidated group, sales grew 10 percent, Mannesmann said.</p>
<p>Incoming orders rose two percent, or by four percent if adjusted for changes to the consolidated group.</p>
<p>The above data are preliminary and will be presented by the management board at a meeting of the supervisory board today, Mannesmann said.</p>
