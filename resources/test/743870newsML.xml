<p>CME cattle and pork complex</p>
<p>pre-opening calls as of 0800 CDT.</p>
<p>LIVE CATTLE - steady to 0.50 cent lower - Nearbys should be 0.25 to 0.50 cent lower, weakened by Friday's bearish cattle-on-feed report which showed lower than expected June marketings. February and April contracts should open steady.</p>
<p>FEEDER CATTLE - 0.10 to 0.20 cent higher. Sharp overnight losses in CBOT corn should be supportive. The latest CME feeder cattle index, for July 17, was up $0.23 per cwt at $81.93, its highest level since April 11, 1994.</p>
<p>LEAN HOGS - 0.10 to 0.20 cent higher. Stronger product values appear to have put packer margins in the black and should increase demand for hogs in the cash market. Cash hogs seen around $0.50 higher on Monday.</p>
<p>PORK BELLIES - 0.50 to 1.50 cent higher. USDA cold storage report Friday showed lower frozen belly stocks than expected. Cash fresh pork belly market appears to still be on upward track.</p>
