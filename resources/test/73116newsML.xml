<p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Mother Teresa, recovering in a hospital from a fall, may return home following a second brain scan, doctors treating the Roman Catholic missionary said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"She may be discharged on Wednesday after the scan," said Dr S.K. Sen, director of Woodlands Nursing Home.</p>
<p>The revered nun, who spent nearly three weeks at Woodlands in late August and early September for heart trouble, malaria and pneumonia, was again taken to the hospital on September 16 after falling from a chair.</p>
<p>The doctors later detected a black spot on her brain after conducting an initial scan. They said it could be a haemorrhage or stem from an earlier injury.</p>
<p>Doctors said Mother Teresa's health was fine and that she was doing well. The second scan was needed to confirm that the spot posed no danger, said Dr Dinamani Banerji, a member of the medical team attending Mother Teresa.</p>
<p>"She has no neuorological problem. But we don't want to give her a false sense of safety since such spots take about seven to eight days to increase in volume in case there is a haemorrhage," Banerjee said.</p>
