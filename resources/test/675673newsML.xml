<p>The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) on Friday confirmed it will cut its main interest rate to an effective annual 16.30 percent from 42.24 percent, from Monday, and said it had changed the method of its calculation.</p>
<p>"The BNB board sets the main interest rate at 16.30 percent annually calculated through accumulation of monthly accruals, to take effect from June 23," the BNB said in a statement. The cut was reported earlier on Friday by local bank dealers.</p>
<p>The BNB said the new main rate was based on the yield on three-month discount T-bills, a change from previous practice to adjust the rate weekly to the weighted average effective monthly yield on four-week maturities auctioned daily from Friday through Thursday.</p>
<p>The average yield to maturity on the three-month paper auctioned on Monday was 3.80 percent.</p>
<p>"The change in the calculation method relates to Finance Ministry's decision to boost sales of three-month government securities and halt 28-day maturities," the statement said.</p>
<p>The BNB did not say whether the main rate would be ajusted weekly under the new method. BNB officials were unavailable to comment.</p>
<p>A Finance Ministry official told Reuters the decision to stop four-week issues from June 30 was recommended by the World Bank after yields on this type of paper fell more rapidly than expected in the past several weeks.</p>
<p>A central bank official said earlier on Friday the decision to halt four-week discount issues in favour of longer maturities was aimed at easing domestic debt servicing.</p>
