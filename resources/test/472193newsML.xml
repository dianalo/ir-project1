<headline>Ga. House names Healthdyne panel members.</headline>
<dateline>ATLANTA 1997-03-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Georgia House on Thursday named three of its members to a House-Senate panel that will reexamine a measure to help Healthdyne Technologies Inc fight off a hostile takeover by Invacare Corp.</p>
<p>The measure, attached to a routine House bill in the Senate last week, would require publicly traded companies based in Georgia to stagger the election of directors.</p>
<p>Named to the six-member conference committee was Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Martin, an Atlanta Democrat who proposed the underlying legislation, known a House Bill 294, which simply called for routine modifications to the state business code.</p>
