<p>Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, operating company of the leading Dutch national airport, will close a major runway in March for between nine and twelve weeks, its cargo director Frits Bisschop, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>The airport is to build a tunnel in three sections linking its north side to the south-east side where a new cargo centre is being developed.</p>
<p>The Kaag runway, designated 06-24, is also to be extended during the closure period and air traffic will be diverted to other runways at Schiphol.</p>
<p>Residents have been warned well in advance, that this will mean some unusual noise activity in some areas adjacent to the airport, he said.</p>
<p>The work will mean traffic will divert to other runways and there will be some disruption of regular flying patterns.</p>
<p>The aim is for most of the construction to take place in March, April and May this year and the airport is planning to formally open the tunnel, new warehousing and a new cargo centre in November. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017</p>
