<p>European growth stocks market Easdaq said on Monday Euroclear and Cedel Bank had joined Swiss-based INTERSETTLE as its settlement providers.</p>
<p>Easdaq said in a statement that while INTERSETTLE would continue to handle market settlement, institutional investors and their custodians would be able to choose between keeping their holdings of Easdaq securities with Brussels-based Euroclear and/or Luxembourg-based Cedel Bank.</p>
<p>"The inclusion of Euroclear and Cedel Bank in the list of settlement prociders will enable Easdaq to broaden further its international investor base," it said.</p>
<p>Jacques Putzeys, chief executive officer of Easdaq, said in the statement that the addition of the two new settlement providers would further accelerate the investor-driven growth of the market.</p>
<p>Easdaq was launched last November and now quotes seven stocks. Putzeys said market capitalisation had already passed the $1.4 billion mark.</p>
<p>Easdaq has members in nine European countries and the United States.</p>
