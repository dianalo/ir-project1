<p>Guyana's President Cheddi Jagan was set to leave for the United States on Saturday for medical treatment after suffering heart problems, government officials said.</p>
<p>Jagan, 78, was taken to Timietri airport from the state-run Georgetown hospital where he spent the night after complaining of "feeling unwell and chest pains," Health Minister Gail Teixiera told Reuters in a brief telephone interview.</p>
<p>Reporters said Jagan smiled and waved as he left the hospital on a stretcher before being taken to the airport.</p>
<p>A U.S. military aircraft was due to take Jagan to Panama where he would be transferred to another plane and flown to Washington for treatment in the Walter Reed hospital in Maryland, Teixiera said.</p>
<p>Information Minister Moses Nagamootoo told state radio Jagan had "a cardiac event" and doctors had recommended further precautionary medical checks.</p>
<p>Jagan's doctor, Hughley Hanoman, said the president had no history of heart problems.</p>
<p>Jagan led his People's Progressive Party (PPP) to victory at the polls in October 1992 -- Guyana's first democratic elections for 28 years. He was previously premier of British Guiana from 1961 to 1964 before Guyana gained independence in 1966.</p>
