<p>ASIAN FOREX ACTIVITY:</p>
<p>0500 GMT-- *Dollar edged up against yen in afternoon Tokyo partly on short-covering by interbank dealers and overseas operators, but topside remained heavy after upside trial above 127.10 yen ended in failure in morning.</p>
<p>*A trust bank dealer said some interbank dealers have dollar long positions after earlier rally in morning, which are likely to keep dollar gains limited.</p>
<p>*Options-linked stop-loss buying expected to emerge near 127.30 yen, but sales to avoid hitting options positions weighing on dollar.  </p>
<p>*"Dealers find it difficult to buy aggressively after the dollar tested its upside in the morning," said another trust bank dealer.</p>
<p>*He added that although exporters sold some dollars near 127 yen earlier in morning, they were not aggressive sellers overall since Japan's "Golden Week" holiday started this week.</p>
<p>*The first trust bank dealer said institutional investors have not been major market players.</p>
<p>0300 GMT --- *Dollar took breather after setting a three-year high of 1.7395 marks and coming close to a 56-month high against the yen by midday Tokyo.  </p>
<p>*Dollar surged against mark and yen as market focused on failure of Group of Seven (G7) meeting on Sunday to make specific reference to "a weak yen" as shared concern.</p>
<p>*G7 communique stressed need to avoid currency rates that spur trade imbalances, which indirectly referred to yen and Japan's rising trade surplus, traders said.</p>
<p>*But market perception that European nations do not seem worried about the dollar's recent rise made traders cover short dollar positions built previously.</p>
