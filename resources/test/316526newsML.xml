<p>Fortune may be blind but in Italy it can also be deaf and dumb.</p>
<p>In a nation of lottery lovers, faith in state-run games has taken a beating during the past year in which machinery blunders have left winners out of pocket. The government has maintained a stony silence while it tries to sort out the problems.</p>
<p>"I believe in good luck, but in Italy that is not enough. Even if you do win, you then have to fight the government to get it to pay up," said Sergio Salvi.</p>
<p>Eight months ago Salvi thought he won 140 million lire ($91,000) in a national instant lottery game called Gratta e Vinci (scratch and win). Four days later he went out and bought himself a bright red Ferrari sports car.</p>
<p>"It was the first time I'd won anything in my life and I was swept up in the euphoria. Buying a Ferrari had always been my dream and I couldn't resist it," said the 41-year-old plasterer from this small northern village.</p>
<p>But Salvi moved too fast. The government, which runs all the national lotteries, has still not paid up and the Ferrari has had to be returned to the showroom.</p>
<p>NUMBERS DON'T ADD UP IN LOTTERY WINDFALL</p>
<p>Salvi was one of hundreds who bought winning tickets in an extraordinary two-day lottery bonanza around Curno last May.</p>
<p>The then finance minister Augusto Fantozzi immediately promised that the people would be paid.</p>
<p>But facing claims totalling over $50 million, the government stalled and opened an enquiry to discover the reasons for the unprecedented avalanche of winners in such a restricted area.</p>
<p>The excitement started on May 1, 1996, when a new batch of instant lottery scratch cards went on sale around the city of Bergamo. Winning combinations began to pour in and the good news spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>Punters came from as far away as Sicily and Switzerland, forming long queues at motorway exits and long lines outside the bars and tobacconists where the cards were being sold.</p>
<p>"At the height of the frenzy we were selling 5,000 tickets an hour," recalls Carla Marcioni, who runs a bar in Curno. "Before then we used to sell at most 1,500 tickets a week."</p>
<p>In less than 24 hours, tickets from her bar alone had won some 1.1 billion lire. In the previous four years only one winning ticket worth 10 million lire had been bought at the bar.</p>
<p>The preliminary government investigation suggests that a printing error threw up more than 2,200 unexpected winning combinations. "The serial numbers on the tickets are not those belonging to winning cards," a ministry official said.</p>
<p>Despite Fantozzi's initial assurances, a government agency wrote in September saying that the winning tickets could not be honoured.</p>
<p>ITALY THREATENED WITH EUROPEAN COURT BY LUCKLESS WINNERS</p>
<p>In the resulting storm of protest, the letters were swiftly withdrawn and a fresh investigation was set up to see if the error had been purely administrative or whether fraud was involved. No payouts will be made until the probe is concluded.</p>
<p>"One man died of a heart attack after getting the letter," said Giorgio Moressa, head of a pressure group representing 400 people which is trying to wrench money from the state.</p>
<p>Moressa said that if the winnings were not handed over by the end of January, demonstrators would set up camp outside the finance ministry. In the meantime he was considering taking action against Italy in the European courts.</p>
<p>"They can't play with people's lives like this. Money is a serious matter," Moressa said.</p>
<p>The owner of ticket U 527243 at Italy's prestigious national New Year lottery would probably agree with him.</p>
<p>The ticket number was drawn on a live television show on January 6, entitling the holder to a prize of two billion lire.</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours later Italy's General Games Committee annulled the result because a technical hitch had prevented four of 10 numbered balls from entering one of the draw machines.</p>
<p>The prize went to someone else and the original winner, who has remained anonymous, ended up empty handed. Consumer groups have demanded that the whole lottery be held again and a court is expected to rule on the contested result later this month.</p>
<p>This fresh failure caused a public outcry, with newspapers suggesting that the finance ministry could not run a bath let alone a lottery.</p>
<p>BACKLASH FEARED AS TREASURY TAKES LOTTERY CASH</p>
<p>The national consumer federation estimated that Italians spent around 20 trillion lire last year on lotteries and football pools, but some people fear the recent debacles will deter Italians from taking a punt.</p>
<p>"Our customers are displaying a lack of confidence in the lotteries and there is bound to be a backlash," said Franco Ragni, head of the association of tobacconists.</p>
<p>In order to regain faith in the system, commentators urged the government to dig into its pockets and honour all its gambling debts, pointing out that last year alone 18.4 billion lire of lottery prize money went unclaimed.</p>
<p>It then transpired that much of the unclaimed lottery money was being channeled into a fund set up to give employees in the Treasury, the budget ministry and the state auditors' office cheap loans and generous severance payments.</p>
<p>The chairman of the fund, Leandro Saonte, told Italia Uno television station that it now had some 120 billion lire at its disposal. Asked if the money might be better spent on good causes, he replied: "Charity begins at home".</p>
<p>Back in Curno, the locals do not feel very charitable towards the state.</p>
<p>"They've ripped me off, robbed me of a dream," said Carla Monaco, who won 100 million lire in last May's scratch card windfall but like everyone else is still waiting for the cash.</p>
<p>"To deceive people, promise them something and then not hand over the goods is as low as you can get. They can stuff their games," she said. ($1 = 1,541 lire)</p>
