<p>Jordan's King Hussein on Tuesday became the first Arab head of state to visit Palestinian-ruled areas, flying his helicopter to the West Bank he controlled until 1967, witnesses said.</p>
<p>The king arrived in Jericho with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, his host, who had visited him in Amman. Palestinian officials said the monarch was trying to arrange a meeting between the two of them and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.  </p>
<p>The trip was the king's first to the West Bank since he lost the territory to Israel in the Six-Day War 29 years ago.</p>
<p>Jericho, 24 km (14 miles) northeast of Jerusalem, was the first West Bank town handed over to Arafat's Palestinian Authority in 1994 under peace deals with Israel.</p>
<p>"It is a very significant visit by the first Arab leader to Palestinian-liberated territories," Arafat's spokesman Nabil Abu Rdainah told Reuters earlier.</p>
<p>"It has political significance because it shows support for the Palestinian position and it deepens Palestinian sovereignty in liberated Palestinian areas," he said.</p>
