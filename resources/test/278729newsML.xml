<p>Thai immigration officials said on Friday they had launched a crackdown against Bangladeshi, Burmese, Cambodian and Laotian workers entering the country illegally.</p>
<p>Spot checks at the airport on Bangladeshis arriving in the country led to the arrest on Thursday night of 67 of them holding fake visas, an immigration official told Reuters.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, immigration authorities rounded up nearly 400 Burmese, Cambodian and Laotian workers who had entered the country illegally, he added.</p>
<p>The official did not say what action would be taken against the 400 who were picked up.</p>
<p>The action follows complaints from Malaysia last week that Bangladeshi workers were using Thailand as a transit point for illegal entry into Malaysia, he added.</p>
<p>"Intead of deporting them (Bangladeshis) we decided to prosecute them on charges of falsifying documents as a deterrent," he said.</p>
<p>The charge carries a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment.</p>
<p>The immigration official said the National Security Council had estimated that about 5,000 Bangladeshis, who had entered Thailand illegally, were hiding in the jungles along the southern Thai-Malaysian border.</p>
