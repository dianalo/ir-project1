<p>People's Bank of China Governor Dai Xianglong has said the central bank wants to boost cooperation with the Bank for International Settlements (BIS), the Financial News said on Monday.</p>
<p>The central bank hopes to cooperate on policy research, central bank policy, rules on supervision of bank transactions and financial deals, the Financial News quoted Dai as telling Andrew Crockett, visiting general manager of the BIS.</p>
<p>Dai said the central bank would continue to implement an appropriately tight monetary policy and attach emphasis on controlling financial risk.</p>
<p>China would take further measures to help financial institutions improve their ability to offset risk such as commercialisation of state banks and increasing the capital adequacy ratio and debt to asset ratio of financial institutions, Dai said.</p>
