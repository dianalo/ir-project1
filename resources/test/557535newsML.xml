<p>Japan's Princess Sayako, speaking to reporters about her trip to Europe next week, said on Friday she is especially looking forward to visiting a French chateau.</p>
<p>"I'm looking forward to tasting wine as I will be visiting a chateau in Bordeaux," Sayako, 28, told a news conference at her residence in Tokyo.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken princess, youngest child of Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko, will make an official visit to France and the Netherlands from May 9 to 19.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac extended the invitation to the Japanese royal family during his visit to Japan last November.</p>
<p>Sayako said her parents and brothers told her of their visits to Europe and gave her materials to read to prepare for the visit.</p>
<p>The Imperial Household Agency denied media reports that Sayako is making the trip in place of Crown Prince Naruhito and Princess Masako.</p>
<p>The reports said the couple cancelled their trip due to Masako's possible pregnancy.</p>
<p>"We've denied the reports. President Chirac extended the invitation to members of the royal family, and it so happened that Princess Sayako was to go," said a spokesman for the agency.</p>
<p>"There was no original plan to have the crown prince and princess visit France," he said.</p>
<p>Japanese media have reported that Princess Masako may be pregnant as she has more than once cancelled her official duties due to "illnesses".</p>
