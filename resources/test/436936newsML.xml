<p>Consultations with the United States on European Union wheat starch production refunds are envisaged if the EU's market share rises significantly beyond 1992 levels, a European Commission spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The spokesman was commenting after U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky on Monday said her agency launched an investigation into allegations that EU subsidies for modified starch were hurting U.S. producers.</p>
<p>"The situation needs to be clarified. It's difficult to assess the size of the U.S. market," the commission spokesman said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Wheat Gluten Industry Council alleged that EU wheat starch subsidies benefited European production and export of wheat gluten to the United States.</p>
<p>Gluten and starch are wheat by-products.</p>
<p>The EU exports about 25,000 tonnes of wheat gluten annually to the U.S., compared with imports of six million tonnes of American corn gluten feed, the EU spokesman noted.</p>
<p>The USTR investigation under Section 301 of U.S. trade law could take up to 180 days, U.S. sources said.</p>
