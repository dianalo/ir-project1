<text>
<p>Nebraska feedlot cattle trade remained at a standstill Tuesday, with light bids at $109.00 to $110.00 per cwt on a dressed basis, passed by owners asking mostly $111.00 to $112.00, market sources said.</p>
<p>Bids also were light on a live basis at $68.00 and passed by owners asking $70.00, the sources said.</p>
<p>The showlist this week was estimated near 85,000 head, up 2,000 from last week. Although the showlist was slightly larger, it contained a greater percentage of lighter weight cattle following active packer buying, which kept feedlots extremely current, they said.</p>
