<p>British American Tobacco officials said on Thursday that a pilot growing project in Cambodia indicated tobacco yields could be doubled within three to five years.</p>
<p>Mohammed Abdul Aleem, general manager of British American Tobacco Cambodia Ltd, also said low-priced Cambodian tobacco leaf could be developed into a $20 million export industry in 10 years.</p>
<p>Aleem made the comments at a farmer's day ceremony in this central Cambodian commune, where 50 farmers are testing new growing methods on 3,500 hectares (8,650 acres).</p>
<p>Currently tobacco yields average 685 kgs (1,510 pounds) per hectare each year with Cambodian farmers generating 8.9 million kgs (19.6 million pounds) of leaf annually in the $13.4 million industry.</p>
<p>Cambodia exports $5 million worth of leaf a year.</p>
<p>Aleem said yields could be doubled through the improved techniques used here and applied in 80 other countries.</p>
<p>Farmers in the commune are expected to increase yields some 600 kgs per hectare annually to 1,200-1,500 kgs per hectare through trimming plants, ridging the soil and using improved seed and curing methods.  </p>
<p>"We are confident, based on the results so far, we can (double the yield)," Aleem told Reuters,</p>
<p>He expected those levels could be reached in three to five years, depending on the number of farmers using the new techniques.</p>
<p>Aleem Said BAT would negotiate more contracts with local farmers in the next year and was willing to supply all farmers with better seed to develop the Cambodian tobacco industry.</p>
<p>BAT Cambodia is a joint venture between British American Tobacco Holdings Ltd (51 percent), Cambodian businessmen Kong Triv (29 percent), and distributor Singapore United Trading Ltd (20 percent).</p>
