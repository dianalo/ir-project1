<p>A Chicago developer expects to announce plans Tuesday for a residential and commercial complex in a rapidly developing neighborhood north of downtown.</p>
<p>Daniel McLean, president of MCL Construction Corp, has scheduled a news conference for 1100 EDT to release plans for the development of a 13-acre parcel north of the Chicago River between Michigan Avenue and Navy Pier.</p>
<p>MCL affiliate Cityfront Center LLC acquired the parcel after winning a bidding war for Chicago Dock &amp; Canal Trust last year.</p>
<p>The development is expected to include a North Pier commercial and office complex as well and may include a video game arcade directed at adults, according to a Chicago Tribune report.</p>
