<p>Late U.S. West Coast light crudes remained solidly lower than yesterday's prices, tracking lower West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil in an illiquid afternoon market, dealers said.</p>
<p>West Coast spot trade was dead as traders left early for the holidays. No new deals closed today for Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude and its discount remained $1.70 a barrel off WTI a week after the last deal got done.</p>
<p>Outright ANS prices, reacting to flat diffs and soft WTI, were 45 cents lower than Thursday at $24.30/24.50 a barrel.  </p>
<p>The dominant seller of ANS stepped out of the market Friday for a holiday function.</p>
<p>Line 63 crude was also lower at $22.85/23.15 a barrel, but no deals were seen on a fixed basis and premiums idled at $0.95 to $1.05.</p>
<p>Kern River prices was flat in late trade after climbing 15 cents to $18.55/18.65 a barrel as companies lifted postings following early week gains in January NYMEX crude.</p>
<p>Discounts remained 10 cents below to even with postings, traders said.</p>
<p>Wilmington crude, produced offshore in Long Beach, Calif., also rose with postings to $20/20.10 a barrel.</p>
