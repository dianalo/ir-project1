<p>A former chief aide to Francois Mitterrand said on Wednesday he would break official secrecy shrouding widespread illegal wiretaps by the late French Socialist president's anti-terror unit.</p>
<p>Gilles Menage, who is among several former officials being probed over the wiretaps, said he would speak out in order to ensure his legal defence and halt what he called a campaign to run down Mitterrand.</p>
<p>"I have decided to free myself from this obligation," Menage, who headed Mitterrand's private office during the wiretaps in the early 1980s, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Public outrage has prompted Prime Minister Alain Juppe to move towards lifting official secrecy after documents showed Mitterrand apparently personally oversaw the bugging of about 2,000 people largely to shield his private life, especially regarding his illegitimate daughter Mazarine.</p>
<p>Juppe said on Tuesday that files uncovered by the security services would be given to an investigating magistrate if experts determined the wiretaps was carried out illegally. He had previously refused to lift secrecy on national security grounds.</p>
<p>His decision appeared to clear the way for the judge probing the bugging to gain access to files on many of the targets, who included lawyers, politicians, journalists and actors.</p>
<p>But the man in charge of sifting through the wiretaps files, Paul Bouchet, admitted he could not be sure that security services would give him all the documents.</p>
<p>"Lifting defence secrecy is the only way of putting an end to a systematic campaign to run down Francois Mitterrand whom I had the honour of serving for 11 years," Menage said.</p>
<p>"It is also the only way of pursuing the investigation in fair conditions respecting the defendants' rights."</p>
<p>The affair has acutely embarrassed the opposition Socialists, who tried to limit the consequences of a damaging quarrel over whether their late leader had the right to order illegal telephone wiretaps when president.</p>
<p>Socialist leader Lionel Jospin said Mitterrand's former confidant, Michel Charasse, wrote to him to apologise for making a stinging attack on his criticism of the bugging.</p>
<p>Jospin has tried to distance the Socialists from the seamy side of Mitterrand's rule, calling for "monarchical secrecy" on wiretaps to be lifted.</p>
<p>But Charasse accused him in a weekend interview of using the controversy to fish for votes and argued that Mitterrand was justified in tapping telephones in a period of terrorist attacks and in the face of a blackmail threat over Mazarine.</p>
<p>His later apology failed to bury the the disagreement entirely. Charasse repeated that he opposed lifting official secrecy, but Jospin said it must apply only when wiretapping was legally authorised on grounds of national security.</p>
