<p>Lithuanian shares rose slightly on Wednesday although activity was light, dealers said.</p>
<p>The views of markets players on the future direction of the market were mixed.</p>
<p>The group A index of leading stocks ticked up 8.61 points to 2,419.33 on turnover of 997,857 litas.</p>
<p>"The situation in the market is ambiguous and it is difficult to forecast its further trends," said Arvydas Jackevicius of broker Suprema.</p>
<p>"There are signs that demand is edging up but it is too premature to say that prices will go up," he added.</p>
<p>One gainer was Ukio Bank, which rose to 18.51 litas from 18.23 litas on turnover of 240,680 litas.</p>
<p>Cardboard maker Medienos Plausis also gained a touch to 15.10 litas from 15 litas on trade of 17,229 litas.</p>
<p>"We think that prices will start to grow in the second half of the March when companies make public their annual financial results at shareholders meetings," Grazina Baciuliene of Vilfima brokers said.</p>
<p>"But prices will not spike up as in January since investors will take into deeper consideration the actual financial results of the companies," she added.</p>
<p>Lithuanian shares saw a bull run in January, part of a trend of increased interest in stocks throughout the Baltic region.</p>
<p>One of the country's top banks, Hermis, saw its shares slip to 200 litas from 204 litas on trade of 165,000 litas although it yesterday forecast a leap in 1996 profits and was last week given a credit rating by Thomson BankWatch.</p>
<p>Bloc trades worth 2.35 million litas were made and Rokiskis Cheese was most traded on 1.40 million litas at a price of 45 litas. Hermis registered bloc activity of 656,340 litas in a price range of 206 to 204 litas.</p>
<p>There were no transactions in the secondary government T-bill market.</p>
