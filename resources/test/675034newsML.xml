<p>French magazine publisher Filipacchi Medias said it expects its profits to rise in 1997, helped by a rise in the dollar, paper prices and low French interest rates.</p>
<p>But it said in its 1996 annual report the world advertising market was frail and could go either way.</p>
<p>"The current state of advertising, given the fragility of trends seen today in the world, both on the upside and downside but still in small proportions, could have an unfavourable influence or, on the contrary, magnify our objectives," it said.</p>
<p>It said it made the forecast without including the effect of a restructuring of the group which is currently being negotiated.</p>
<p>In 1996 Filipacchi Medias, the magazine publishing unit of Lagardere's Hachette, had net attributable profit of 171.4 million francs, up 30 percent from the previous year.</p>
