<p>Northeast Utilities' fourth-quarter results announced late on Tuesday were the final blow of a very bad year, casting a grim shadow over the company's prospects in 1997, analysts said.</p>
<p>New England's biggest utility reported a fourth-quarter loss of $76.4 million, or 60 cents a share, compared with net income of $64.2 million, or 50 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1995.  </p>
<p>Analysts had expected a fourth-quarter loss of around four cents per share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.</p>
<p>Northeast remains plagued by two major challenges -- fixing its troubled nuclear operation, and coping with imminent electricity industry dereguation, first in New Hampshire, and eventually in Massachusetts and Connecticut, analysts said.</p>
<p>"They've got two huge challenges in 1997 -- that's what makes the picture grim," said Barry Abramson, an analyst at Prudential Securities.  </p>
<p>"One of them will take a lot of money and time," he said, referring to the company's efforts to restart its three Millstone nuclear plants in Waterford, Conn.</p>
<p>"The other is more uncertain -- how they can resolve the issue of being a large, high-cost producer in an industry that's about to be deregulated."</p>
<p>"Nineteen ninety-seven is going to be their watershed year, the year that tells the tale," said Ed Tirello, analyst at NatWest Securities.  </p>
<p>"If they get through it, they should be okay. But if the New Hampshire outcome is not as we hoped, and if they don't get at least one Millstone plant back up and running, I think they're in real trouble."</p>
<p>All three units at the Millstone nuclear power station, with a combined capacity of 2,700 megawatts (MW), have been shut since March of last year amid safety concerns raised by the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).</p>
<p>Northeast said last month it expected to have all three plants ready for restart by early 1998, pending approval by the NRC.  </p>
<p>To compensate for the loss of nearly half of Connecticut's power generation, Northeast has been purchasing power at a cost of around $30 million a month.</p>
<p>"We are hopeful of having at least one of the nuclear units back on line in the third quarter (of 1997), and that will go a long way toward improving our situation," Northeast spokesman Tom Shiel told Reuters.</p>
<p>Northeast attributed the weak results mainly to its nuclear woes, and said the 1996 figures included a $63 million accounting reserve to help pay for 1997 expenditures related to the company's nuclear program.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the Millstone shutdown remains a major cash-flow problem for Northeast, which last summer cut its quarterly dividend to 25 cents from 44 cents to save cash.</p>
<p>An elimination of the dividend is likely this year, said Dan Scotto, analyst at Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.</p>
<p>"There's a better than 50-50 chance that they might have to eliminate their dividend this year, if there's no positive momentum anywhere, in order to appease the lenders," he said.  </p>
<p>Scotto said 1997 would be "a very tough year" for the company. "I do not expect to see positive 1997 earnings for the company. It's hard to be optimistic at all about earnings prospects for 1997."</p>
<p>The company is also grappling with an imminent and unfavorable deregulation situation in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>Northeast warned on Jan. 17 that two of its largest operating units -- Public Service Co. of New Hampshire (PSNH) and North Atlantic Energy Corp. -- could be forced to file for bankruptcy protection and write off assets valued at about $800 million if New Hampshire proceeds with an electricity deregulation plan.</p>
<p>"Deregulation in New Hampshire is big-time, because PSNH has been the one company that was making money," said Penelope Adelmann, analyst at Gruntal &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Between Millstone and New Hampshire deregulation, "It's kind of like, pick your poison," said Scotto.</p>
<p>Analysts said the company's share price, which dipped 0-1/4 to 12-1/2 on Tuesday, could re-test its October 1996 lows around 9-1/2 if New Hampshire deregulation is not resolved in Northeast's favor.</p>
