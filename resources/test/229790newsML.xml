<p>Australian wool prices are expected to stabilise, Wesfarmers Dalgety Ltd said in its weekly market preview.</p>
<p>The eastern market indicator last week fell 15 cents to 552 cents a kg clean, while the western market indicator fell two cents to 532 cents a kg clean.</p>
<p>Sales this week are in Newcastle, Adelaide and Launceston with 91,000 bales on offer.</p>
<p>"Expectations that the A$ will remain abouve 80 cents to the U.S.$ , for the short term at least, are starting to negatively affect prices, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters said.  </p>
<p>Wesfarmers said the rapid appreciation of the A$ against both the US$, peaking at 81.48 cents, and the yen, reaching a four year high at 92.05, was a major deterrent and will continue to have a large effect on the broad wool end of the market.</p>
<p>"The recognition that these prices are at record low levels is expected to stimulate buying activity and and sharp grower resistance to lower prices will prevent prices falling further.</p>
<p>Most recent futures market activity supports this, with a discontinuation of the downward trend and prices now bouncing off levels of support," Wesfarmers said.</p>
