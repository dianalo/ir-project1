<title>BOSNIA: Bosnian election results confirmed.</title>

<p>The international body supervising Bosnia's post-war elections said on Sunday it had certified the results of national balloting on September 14.</p>
<p>Kasim Begic, the Bosnian member of the Provisional Election Commission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), told reporters: "The preliminary results are certified as final."  </p>
<p>The decision brought to an end days of dispute over allegations that more votes had been cast than there were voters.</p>
<p>Bosnia's first poll since fighting ended last November selected a three-member collective presidency, a national House of Representatives, separate Moslem-Croat and Serb parliaments, a Serb republic president and cantonal assemblies.</p>
<p>The certification of election results is expected to pave the way for the permanent lifting of economic sanctions against rump Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro, diplomats said.</p>
<p>The sanctions, which were suspended last November, were imposed by the U.N. Security Council for Belgrade's military support of separatist Bosnian Serb forces.</p>
