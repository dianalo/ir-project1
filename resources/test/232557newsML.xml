<p>A storm of protest from German opposition parties and citizens' groups on Tuesday greeted a government panel's plan to raise value-added tax to finance a comprehensive income tax reform.</p>
<p>A tax reform commission headed by Finance Minister Theo Waigel intends to raise 30 billion marks ($19.2 billion) for the government by increasing VAT by about two percentage points as part of an overhaul of the income tax system planned for 1999. The plan still aims for a net 30 billion mark tax cut.</p>
<p>But opponents said any tax increases would be intolerable as they fly in the face of the trend toward smaller government.</p>
<p>The VAT increase is "the worst idea ever," said Karl Heinz Daeke, president of the Taxpayers' Alliance, in a radio interview.</p>
<p>"(The government) would be calling on those who pay no income taxes like students, pensioners and the unemployed to finance the budget in other ways. Higher indirect taxes would be asking them to pay up without benefiting from tax reform."</p>
<p>Rudolf Scharping, parliamentary chief of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD), said: "The government's tax policies are based on a limitless burdening of middle-income groups and a limitless unburdening of those better-off. It is wrong to raise VAT to finance tax reform."</p>
<p>The government has said it sees a need to increase the ratio of indirect taxes such as VAT to direct taxes such as income tax, and to raise VAT to bring it into line with European neighbours.</p>
<p>The panel would leave the lower German VAT rate charged on food and other basic goods unchanged at seven percent. The higher rate, charged on other items, would however rise to 17 percent from 15 percent.</p>
<p>The tax reform commission is due to make its proposals to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet on December 11.</p>
<p>Hans Eichel, SPD premier of Hessen state, said the plan to raise VAT shows the government really cannot afford to cut taxes as it says it wants to. "There is no money to cut taxes," Eichel told the Cologne daily newspaper Express.</p>
<p>The willingness of the Free Democrats (FDP), junior coalition partners to Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), to go along with the plan shows they are not really the champions of tax cuts they claim to be, Eichel said.</p>
<p>Daeke said the coalition must lower direct taxes, and concentrate on its own goal of shrinking the government's share of the economy to 46 percent from the current 50 percent.</p>
<p>He said more government personnel, subsidies and transfers to east Germany could be cut to achieve a slimmer budget. Government support for families with children should also be examined, particularly for the affluent.</p>
<p>Pension benefits should also be curtailed, he said.</p>
<p>The tax debate will involve "a great hewing and stabbing" among rival interest groups, Daeke said.</p>
<p>The tax reform aims to lower the top income tax rate to less than 40 percent from the current 53 percent, and the lowest rate to about 20 percent.</p>
<p>The resulting estimated 90 billion mark shortfall in revenue would be partly made up by the VAT increase. Another 30 billion marks would come from eliminating tax exemptions and loopholes. The remaining 30 billion marks would be the net tax cut for taxpayers. ($1=1.5647 Mark)</p>
