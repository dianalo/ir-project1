<p>A major opinion poll forecast for the first time on Tuesday that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) could win an outright majority in Japan's general election on Sunday.</p>
<p>The poll's finding after weeks of forecasts that no party would win a majority signalled a possible end to two years of LDP-led coalition rule in Japan.</p>
<p>The poll of 150,000 voters conducted by the business daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun at the weekend showed the LDP was likely to have a simple majority of 251 seats, and possibly more, in the 500-seat Lower House of parliament.</p>
<p>Such a result would return the conservative LDP to the position of sole power it held for nearly four decades until the last election in 1993 ousted it from power and ushered in a period of revolving-door coalition rule.</p>
<p>The LDP held 211 Lower House seats when parliament was dissolved earlier this month. It ruled in coalition with the Socialists and the Sakigake Party, an LDP splinter group.</p>
<p>The poll found voters appeared to be turning against Japan's main opposition group, Shinshinto (the New Frontier Party), which it said would struggle to maintain its present number of 160 seats.</p>
<p>The Democratic Party, formed only last month by defectors from the two smaller parties that were in the ruling coalition, was doing well and could win 52 seats, the poll said.</p>
<p>Sunday's election will be the first held under a new electoral system in which 300 members of the Lower House will be chosen in single-seat constituencies, while 200 will be elected through proportional representation decided by party strength.</p>
<p>A record 1,503 candidates are running.</p>
<p>If the poll result is borne out, it would mark a victory for Hashimoto in his determination to stick with an unpopular plan to increase the current three-percent sales tax to five percent from April.</p>
<p>Shinshinto leader Ichiro Ozawa has tried to woo voters with promises of a cut in income tax and a pledge to delay a rise in the sales tax for several years.</p>
<p>Political analysts said the apparent late surge by the LDP indicated that the organisational strength of the party was still intact despite the past three years of turmoil.</p>
<p>They said voters might also be deciding that the time had come to return to strong and undivided leadership to tackle the problem of the country's sluggish economic growth.</p>
<p>Shinshinto, a grouping of nine opposition parties, was formed at the end of 1994 and has struggled for unity among its members.</p>
