<p>Despite recent civil and political turmoil and a widening current account deficit, Indonesia remains an attractive proposition for investors willing to wait out some economic engineering, analysts say.</p>
<p>While the general trend is to expect "a fairly well-managed economy" to keep growing, Marshall Mays, chief strategist at Nikko Research Center in Hong Kong, said big investors seeking quick profits could be looking in the wrong place.</p>
<p>"If they don't have the comfort level with their source of funds, their liquidity, perhaps they shouldn't be going into Indonesia because it could be a volatile market," he said.</p>
<p>Christopher Day, joint managing director of Thornton Management (Asia) Ltd in Hong Kong, said Indonesia must find a balance between slowing the economy and bringing down interest rates to stem the influx of foreign money chasing the differential offered by the rupiah.</p>
<p>"Even though the government would like to institute measures to cool the economy, it looks like interest rates are on their way down," Day said. "If interest rates come down, you should be investing."</p>
<p>But while the short-term outlook is good, Day said, policy moves to cool the economy are likely to follow.</p>
<p>"Longer term they've still got to slow the pace of the economy down or else it'll lead to more inflation -- but they have to find some way of doing it," he said. "If interest rates are coming down, they can't use that as a mechanism."</p>
<p>In a recent report on Indonesia, Nomura Research Institute forecast economic growth would slow slightly but remain a robust 7.4 percent in 1996 and 7.5 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>However, it added that the external trade picture was not altogether encouraging.</p>
<p>Tight monetary policy and the central bank's call to private banks to restrict lending would rein in growth, Nomura said, although foreign investors would continue to fuel the economy, attracted by a "cheap workforce, abundance of natural resources and a large domestic market".</p>
<p>Last week, the Indonesian government said the current account deficit widened 20.6 percent in the first six months of fiscal 1996/97 (April-March) to US$4.521 billion from $3.749 billion during the same period last year.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said on Tuesday that last year's economic growth of 8.1 percent signalled overheating.</p>
<p>"This situation is reflected by high inflation and the pressure on the current account deficit," Mar'ie said. "To reduce overheating is top of the agenda in the government's economic policy -- among other ways by reducing credit growth as the main cause of money supply expansion."</p>
<p>Mays said Indonesia suffers many of the same trade imbalance problems of other fast-growing economies in the region, brought on by the need to import large amounts of capital equipment, technology and expertise.</p>
<p>"They're building an industrial economy and it could be decades before they put everything in place," he said.</p>
<p>Nomura said it expected the current account deficit to widen, with interest payments on Jakarta's large external debt and repatriation of profits by foreign investors pushing up the services deficit to an estimated $13.6 billion in 1996 and $14.8 billion in 1997 from $12.9 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>The World Bank has said Indonesia's foreign debt stands at about $100 billion.</p>
<p>Domestic politics will also play a role in any investment decision, analysts said, in light of riots in Jakarta in July and protests in East Timor in November.</p>
<p>With parliamentary elections due next May and no successor to 75-year-old President Suharto in sight, 1997 will be a transitional year from an investment perspective, Mays said.</p>
<p>"There will probably be one or two occasions during the next 12 to 15 months when foreign investors are going to get spooked by things that are said and things that are done," he said.</p>
<p>"I think it's a market they definitely should be investing in," Mays said, but he cautioned that investors should anticipate returns to come in years rather than months.</p>
