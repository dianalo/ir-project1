<p>Rotterdam and Antwerp bunker prices were little changed in very quiet trade on Monday, with volume totalling only about 10,000 tonnes, dealers said.</p>
<p>"We are waiting for prices to drop further. OPEC production is continuing to rise and it's a weak time of year for the bunker market anyhow, so prices are bound to go down," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 cst was priced at about $85 a tonne, with 180 cst at $90. Antwerp prices were about the same to $1 above Rotterdam.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean was also little changed from Friday in a generally slow market, dealers said. Piraeus 380 cst was at $89/91 and 180 cst some $6 higher. Fos 380 cst was priced at $91 and 180 cst at $97.</p>
<p>Fujairah 380 cst was likewise steady with 380 cst at $96/100 and 180 cst at $102/104.</p>
