<p>U.S. shares traded here moved higher on Friday on follow-through buying after interest rate optimism sent the Dow to its fifth consecutive record closing high on Thursday night, dealers said.</p>
<p>"There's been decent buying interest across the board and we expect Wall Street to open up providing there are no nasty surprises to bop interest rate hopes on the head in the PPI numbers," said one dealer.</p>
<p>May producer prices are due at 1230 GMT and are seen showing a 0.1 percent monthly rise, against a 0.6 percent drop last time, or an year-on-year 0.9 percent.</p>
