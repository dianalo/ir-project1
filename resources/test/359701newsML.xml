<p>Steady asking rates for almost all upland descriptions of raw cotton stimulated renewed buying in Germany, France and Belgium, industry sources reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Central Asian medium and better qualities were the focus of attention although Portugal saw a leisurely interest in West African descriptions, they said.</p>
<p>Sources in Eastern Europe reported some limited demand for selected long staple varieties but the volume of raw cotton trade was said to be low. --London Newsroom, +44 171 542 8071</p>
