<p>A proposed $395 million, mostly bond-financed renovation of Chicago's professional football stadium is apparently dead, according to local news reports over the weekend.</p>
<p>Reports in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times said estimated cost-overruns, as well as disinterest on the part of large conventions shut the door on Mayor Richard Daley's plan to construct a retractable roof over Soldier Field.</p>
<p>Daley proposed the plan in September in attempt to pacify the wishes of Illinois Gov. Jim Edgar, who favored a multi-use domed facility, and Bears owner Michael McCaskey, who wanted his team to play in an open-air facility.</p>
<p>According to news reports, new proposals were being floated to build an open-air facility near the city's McCormick Place convention center and to renovate Soldier Field in its current open-air form.</p>
<p>Another proposal reportedly called for building an assembly hall adjacent to McCormick Place.</p>
