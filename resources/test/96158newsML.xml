<text>
<p>The Hungarian government fired the board of privatisation agency APV Friday, saying it had made irregular payments of millions of dollars to lawyer Marta Tocsik, who negotiated with municipalities on APV's behalf.</p>
<p>The government spared Tamas Suchman, the minister in charge of APV, although opposition parties said he was responsible and should go.</p>
<p>The supervisory committee of APV, unveiling the results of their inquiry into the Tocsik affair, said Prime Minister Gyula Horn did not react to their early warnings concerning the operations of APV.</p>
<p>Opposition party FIDESZ continued to demand the resignation of Suchman and one of its high-ranking officials, Tamas Deutsch, said that ultimately the prime minister was responsible for what his government dids.</p>
<p>The head of the APV's supervisory board, Sandor Puskas, said the board had only limited power and insight into APV's activity.</p>
