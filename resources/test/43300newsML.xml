<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures jumped sharply higher in nervous trading on Tuesday after Iraq said it had fired three missiles at U.S. aircraft, traders said.</p>
<p>IPE Brent stood 21 cents up at $22.82 at 1810 GMT, a jump of almost 20 cents from a few minutes earlier, following a day of very choppy trading. The contract earlier broke upwards through $22.85 five-month highs before settling back sharply.</p>
<p>"People are nervous at the moment," one IPE dealer said. "A lot of people were short and a headline like this will cause a sharp jump".</p>
