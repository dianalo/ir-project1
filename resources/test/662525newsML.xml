<p>Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (Dasa), announcing a bid for a Siemens AG defense unit, on Sunday called for Europe's aerospace industry to consolidate into a constellation of contractors that can compete with the huge groupings that have arisen in the U.S.</p>
<p>Dasa urged other firms to step up the pace of mergers within their own borders, and to use the restructuring of commercial jet maker Airbus Industrie as a step toward integration of military and space activities into a broad European group.</p>
<p>"The rapid concentraton in the U.S. gives a clear signal of what has to be done in Europe," chief executive Manfred Bischoff said at a news conference at the Paris airshow. "We are taking action, and we would like to see our example folowed in other secotors of the industry."</p>
<p>Reforming Airbus into a corporation controlling assets including design and production could serve as the first step toward integrating European operations in commercial and military jets, defense electronics and space, he said.</p>
<p>"The consolidation of Airbus Industrie into a single corporate entity will inevitably occur...Let's start with the area where it is easiest and there's the most progress. Why not bring those (other) areas later into a European (group), " Bischoff said.</p>
<p>Bischoff echoed views expressed on Saturday by Airbus member British Aerospace Plc, which also called for consolidation to combat the U.S. groups boosted in recent mergers -- Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, and the proposed Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas link-up.</p>
<p>The Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger was a "wake-up call" for Europe, he said.</p>
<p>BAe also emphasised that that bringing Europes leading companies together to form a similar monolithic company should come after the resturucturing of Airbus.</p>
<p>But the restructuring talks have been complicated by the desire of Airbus' French member Aerospatiale to retain ownership of its design and production centres.</p>
<p>Bischoff said he thought Airbus could define a structure that satisfies the needs of Aerospatiale and the other partners. "The most important thing is to have one management that has total control, beginning with production development to customer support. The question of legal ownership (of the assets) is a second question."</p>
<p>A complete Airbus corporation as well as the Eurocopter venture involving Dasa and Aerospatiale could serve as an example for a multi-country groupings that set aside national pride while boosting European competitiveness.</p>
<p>"National egotism has to take a back seat. What we need are true European joint ventures," Bischoff said. "The future of high technology in Europe is at stake."</p>
<p>To accelerate consolidation in Germany, Dasa has submitted a bid for the defense electronics business Siemens has sought to sell since February.</p>
<p>Bischoff declined to say how much Dasa had bid for the Siemens unit, but said its offer "had a very friendly reception."</p>
<p>The unit includes Siemens Plessey in Britain. Siemens has said it wanted a buyer with defense as its core business.</p>
