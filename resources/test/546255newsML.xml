<p>Rebels said on Tuesday their frontline units had entered the Zairean provincial town of Kikwit and they expected to have full control of it by the end of the day.</p>
<p>"The Zairean army abandoned Kikwit and our first units have entered the town," a senior rebel commander told Reuters. "We expect to consolidate and have full control of the town later in the day."</p>
<p>Residents said on Monday rebels advancing on the capital Kinshasa were closing in on Kikwit, 400 km (250 miles) to the east, and local authorities had asked Zairean government soldiers to lay down their arms.</p>
<p>They said the local administrator had asked the contingent of Zairean troops to lay down their arms and cease any resistance against Laurent Kabila's rebels, who have captured more than half of Zaire's vast territory since last October.</p>
<p>A senior military official in the capital said he was unable to confirm or deny the report.</p>
<p>Kikwit, which shot into the world headlines because of an Ebola virus epidemic which killed more than 120 people there in 1995, is the commercial capital of Bandundu province, which supplies most of Kinshasa's domestically produced food.</p>
<p>Kabila, who returned to Lubumbashi on Monday after weekend talks in Kisangani in a bid to defuse a public relations disaster for the rebels over treatment Rwandan Hutu refugees, expects to meet U.S. troubleshooter Bill Richardson later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Richardson, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, went into ailing President Mobutu Sese Seko's Camp Tshatshi residence in Kinshasa on Tuesday seeking a negotiated end to the war.</p>
<p>Kabila, head of the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, said on Monday he was still open to a peaceful transfer of power in Kinshasa and was committed to meeting Mobutu for talks.</p>
<p>But he also told a Japanese delegation that force was still an option if a peaceful handover of power proved impossible.</p>
<p>"I'm still asking for negotiations because I believe a peaceful transfer of power in Kinshasa is the best thing. But if we do not get a positive response on peace talks, we leave the military option open," he said.</p>
<p>Kabila said final touches were being put to a pact mediated by South Africa and both sides had almost agreed on a venue for face-to-face talks but details had to be worked out.</p>
<p>The rebel chief says he will meet Mobutu only to discuss how he will stand down as Zaire's leader after 32 years in power.</p>
