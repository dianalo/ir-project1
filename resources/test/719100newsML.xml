<p>A controversial ruling on cellular "roaming" rights in provincial Peru has sparked a slanging match and legal dispute between the two main foreign-owned competitors in Peru's booming telecommunications market.</p>
<p>Already dubbed Peru's "cellular war," and with hundreds of millions of dollars in revenues at stake, the conflict has pitted against each other the subsidiaries of Spanish and U.S. telecommunications giants Telefonica de Espana SA and BellSouth Corp.  </p>
<p>The dispute began when Peru's telecommunications regulatory body OSIPTEL ruled July 1 that Spanish-controlled Telefonica del Peru SA should share its provincial cellular access facilities with U.S.-controlled Tele 2000.</p>
<p>Tele 2000 currently only has roaming facilities in Lima and its neighboring port Callao, meaning its clients cannot use their cellular phones from outside the capital.  </p>
<p>Telefonica claims the ruling is a "defacto expropriation" of its services which would cost the company revenue, set back investment plans and create a "climate of legal insecurity" in the local telecommunications market.</p>
<p>If an appeal to OSIPTEL "does not come down in our favor ... we will take this to the judiciary," Telefonica's new president Manuel Garcia said.</p>
<p>He added that if the decision were ratified, Telefonica would paralyze a $160 million investment program for its cellular network.  </p>
<p>"What Telefonica has done is invest around $100 million outside Lima when no one was interested in that service. There were six communities covered before; now there are 70," he added.</p>
<p>OSIPTEL's ruling has theoretically to be carried out within 15 days of its issue, and Tele 2000 has already begun a publicity campaign trumpeting new nationwide access for its clients.</p>
<p>Telefonica del Peru, formed after Telefonica de Espana paid $2.002 billion in a 1994 privatization, has a monopoly on conventional telephones until 1999.  </p>
<p>But that monopoly does not extend to cellulars, said Tele 2000's corporate manager Rafael Diez Canseco.  "It only gives the monopoly to fixed telephones for national long-distance and international services," he said.</p>
<p>BellSouth bought a controlling 59 percent stake in Tele 2000, Telefonica's biggest competitor, for $112.2 million at the beginning of this year.  It plans $150 million in investments for this year, mainly in the cellular market.  </p>
<p>Diez Canseco argued that OSIPTEL's decision merely levelled the playing field for the cellular market because "in Peru, roaming is a public service because in the interior of the country there is only one operator, and that is Telefonica del Peru."</p>
<p>Prior to OSIPTEL's ruling, the government had planned to auction another license for provincial cellular services within the next six months, with Tele 2000 assumed to be the main potential buyer.  </p>
<p>Garcia of Telefonica urged the government to speed up that sale as a matter of urgency. "The price might be betweeen $50 million and $100 million," he added.</p>
<p>Analyst Hernan Garrido Lecca, head of local consultancy Norandina, said the government was responsible for the controversy because it had not foreseen "this hole" in the telecommunications legislation.  "Technically, the OSIPTEL decision was correct, but incomplete.  While the "B" band (provincial concession) has not been offered, the government should have said that Tele 2000 could use Telefonica's roaming facilities, but at a negotiated rate," he said.</p>
<p>OSIPTEL has withheld comment beyond calling on both companies to respect the appeal procedures and "subject themselves to reserve" during the process.</p>
<p>With both companies giving a batch of media interviews, and taking out full-page adds in Lima dailies to argue their cases, it appears that advice has gone unheeded.</p>
