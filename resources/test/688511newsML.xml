<p>The International Transport Workers Federation (ITF) said today it was adding two nations to its list of designated flags of convenience (FOCs).</p>
<p>The Seafarers' Union said it was adding Aruba and Cambodia to the list of FOCs.</p>
<p>The ITF added that a number of other countries' shipping registers are under investigation, including Ukraine, the Philippines, Singapore and Madeira.</p>
<p>The investigations are likely to be completed within 12 months.</p>
<p>The ITF takes action against FOCs because it claims that operators using those shipping registers do not pay sufficient wages or employ seafarers under good enough conditions.</p>
<p>The ITF also confirmed that it will take a 15-20 day long campaign of action against FOCs in the Asia-Pacific region in November or December this year.</p>
<p>It will also have a worldwide week of action in the summer of 1998.</p>
