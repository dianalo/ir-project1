<p>Jakarta stocks are seen flat in slow trading on Tuesday, with sentiment seen remaining cautious following recent volatility of the rupiah, brokers said.</p>
<p>"Sentiment, particularly on the banking stocks, is likely to stay cautious due to the volatile rupiah," one broker with a large local brokerage firm said.</p>
<p>Banking stocks came under strong selling pressure in the past several days following the volatile rupiah and the central bank's curb on property loans, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Rupiah continued to recover against the dollar in early trading on Tuesday after previously sliding on regional turbulence, bank dealers said.</p>
<p>Brokers said local active buying in second-liners due mostly to speculative buying was likely to limit any possible sharp downtrend.</p>
<p>Stocks to watch include second-liner retailer Multipolar on market talk of a possible upward revision in the firm's 1997 net profit forecast, brokers said.</p>
<p>On Monday the Jakarta composite index ended down 0.91 points at 722.50 points. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364</p>
