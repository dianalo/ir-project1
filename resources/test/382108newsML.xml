<p>Venezuela's inflation target for 1997 has probably been thrown off track by recent pay rise offers made to public sector workers, Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff said on Monday.</p>
<p>"We started working with a target of 25 percent based on the tendency to decelerate which inflation has shown," Petkoff told a business conference.</p>
<p>"But based on the salary increase agreements and arrangements in severance payments, it (inflation) could rise a little (above the target)," he added.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Luis Raul Matos Azocar announced last week an improved 35 percent pay rise offer and 50 percent increase in bonus payments for the country's 1.2 million public sector employees.</p>
<p>The government had originally offered a 25 percent increase but this provoked a wave of protests and strikes.</p>
<p>Independent analysts say the government's hopes to slash inflation from 103 percent last year to under 30 percent in 1997 are far-fetched and forecast price rises of about 50 percent. ((-- Maria Jose Gonzalez, Caracas newsroom, 582 505 2600))</p>
