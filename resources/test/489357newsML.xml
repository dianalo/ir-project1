<p>Allen Ginsberg, poet laureate of the beat generation, died of complications from incurable liver cancer on Saturday at the age of 70, Bill Morgan, a personal friend said.</p>
<p>Ginsberg, whose raw, angry verse epitomised America's beat literary movement in the 1950s and '60s, had been ill for some time but news of his incurable cancer was made public only two days ago.</p>
<p>He died at 2:39 a.m. EST (0739 GMT) surrounded by family and friends at his apartment on the lower East Side of New York, said Morgan, his bibliographer and unofficial spokesman.</p>
<p>The primary cause of death was cardiopulmonary arrest with the secondary cause cancer of the liver, he said.</p>
<p>Ginsberg's inoperable liver cancer was discovered when the poet, who had been suffering from severe fatigue and jaundice, underwent a biopsy, his physician, Dr. David Chain, said in a statement released on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Chain said at the time that he expected Ginsberg, who was working at home on a new collection of poems, to live for four to 12 months.</p>
<p>"We never thought he would go so quickly," Morgan said.</p>
<p>Morgan said that after Ginsberg got home on Wednesday, he worked all day and into the night writing poems and talking to old friends.</p>
<p>"On Thursday, he was very tired and slept most of the day," Morgan said.</p>
<p>During Thursday night, Ginsberg slipped into a coma and never regained consciousness, he said.</p>
<p>Ginsberg had suffered for many years from hepatitis C, which led to cirrhosis of the liver that was diagnosed in 1988.</p>
<p>In 1956, Ginsberg published "Howl and Other Poems," a book of free verse considered the preeminent poetic work of the beat movement of the 1950s.</p>
<p>The poetry was the subject of an obscenity case, based on its graphic sexual references, but the publisher was cleared in a landmark decision in 1957.</p>
<p>Ginsberg and other writers such as Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso, William Burroughs and Lawrence Ferlinghetti came to embody the bohemian, anti-establishment, non-conformist literary movement that experimented heavily with hallucinogenic drugs.</p>
<p>Ginsberg, also a musician and photographer, became a celebrant of the counterculture movement of the 1960s, a ubiquitous figure at poetry readings on college campuses, a strident critic of the Vietnam War and an advocate for gay rights.</p>
<p>He taught English at Brooklyn College and wrote more than 40 works of poetry. His book "Fall of America" won the National Book Award in 1972, and he was a Guggenheim poetry fellow in 1965-66.</p>
<p>Born in Newark, New Jersey, Ginsberg was educated at Columbia University and was a longtime resident of New York City's East Village.</p>
<p>His father, Louis, who also was a poet, died of liver cancer in 1968.</p>
<p>Morgan said funeral services for Ginsberg, a Buddhist, would be private, and that a later memorial service was planned.</p>
