<p>Russia's international flagship carrier Aeroflot plans to streamline its fleet to improve cost efficiencies, the company's director said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Yevgeny Shaposnikov told a news conference that the company would gradually eliminate seven types of aircraft, leaving them just three different models in their fleet.</p>
<p>"We plan to operate Ilyushin-96 long-range jets powered by U.S.-made engines, Tupolev-204 medium-range jets and Boeing 737 aircraft for short-range flights," Shaposhnikov said.</p>
<p>Shaposhnikov declined to say when Aeroflot confirmed its order to buy ten 737 jets from Boeing Co. "We are in talks with the company," he said.</p>
<p>Aeroflot now operates 120 aircraft of ten different models, forcing it to spend a lot of money on repairs and maintenance, Shaposnikov said.</p>
