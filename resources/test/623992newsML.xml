<headline>GM Delphi spinoff may be delayed until '98.</headline>

<p>General Motors Corp Chairman Jack Smith said Thursday it will be difficult for the company to complete the spinoff of 20 percent of its Delphi Automotive Systems parts unit this year.</p>
<p>Smith, speaking to reporters at a breakfast briefing, said the Delphi transaction must follow the sale of GM's Hughes Electronics Corp defense operations.</p>
<p>He said the Hughes deal currently is not expected to be completed until the fourth quarter.  </p>
<p>"It would be a big challenge to get it done this year," Smith said of the Delphi transaction.</p>
<p>He and GM Vice Chairman Harry Pearce said the Delphi deal would also have to follow the complete integration of Hughes's Delco Electronics unit into Delphi. That also cannot occur until the sale of Hughes's defense assets to Raytheon Co.</p>
<p>GM announced in January it would sell the Hughes defense operations to Raytheon in a transaction valued at about $9.5 billion.  </p>
<p>GM is awaiting rulings on tax and anti-trust issues related to the Hughes-Raytheon deal and expects those matters to be resolved favorably, Pearce said.</p>
<p>"We anticipate closing the whole series of Hughes transactions in the fourth quarter, so until that happens, you can't do a full integration" of Delco Electronics into Delphi, he said.</p>
<p>Smith said GM had completed about 70 percent of its current $2.5 billion stock buyback program. He declined to say whether losses from GM's recent labor strikes would affect the automaker's ability to launch future buyback programs.</p>
<p>"At the moment, we are continuing to complete the buyback that we started," he said.</p>
<p>Pearce said the recent decline in the price of Electronic Data Systems Corp stock had hurt GM's pension fund, which owns more than 100 million EDS shares. But this has not put the pension fund into an under-funded position, he said.</p>
<p>EDS was up 1/8 at 38 in morning trading. Its 52-week high is 63-3/8. GM spun off EDS in June 1996.</p>
