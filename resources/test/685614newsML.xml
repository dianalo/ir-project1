<p>Hungary's milling wheat futures prices continued to fall on Wednesday as the world crop outlook was positive and the good weather in Hungary promised a substantial surplus, traders said.</p>
<p>"Good news about the expected crop comes from everywhere," said Antal Szoke of Agrimpex Kft. "We can drop to even lower price levels."</p>
<p>All milling wheat futures maturities eased, most of them by the daily limit of 400 forints.</p>
<p>The July maturity closed at 20,170 forints per tonne, down by 240, while most actively traded December finished at 21,350, down 400 forints.</p>
<p>Maize futures closed steady to lower, with July ending at 21,080 forints, unchanged, while both December and March dropped 10 to 19,410 and 21,000 forints respectively.</p>
<p>Maize for July 1998 closed 100 forints down at 22,900.</p>
<p>Some feed producers had begun to buy barley and this led to a rise for shorter maturities, while barley for December dropped 200 forints to 22,200, traders said.</p>
<p>Total grains futures turnover on the Budapest Commodity Exchange rose to 1,081 billion forints or 2,525 lots on Wednesday, from 592.97 million forints or 1,352 lots on Tuesday.</p>
<p>(Lot size=20,000 kgs $=185.37 Hungarian forints)</p>
