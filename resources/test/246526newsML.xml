<p>CBOT corn futures closed lower on a drop in soybeans, traders said.</p>
<p>Near-ideal crop weather in South America hit soybeans and corn, they said.</p>
<p>A bearish outlook for corn prices from the CEO of Memphis-based analytical firm Sparks Companies also weighed on corn futures, the traders said.</p>
<p>Sparks CEO Carrol Brunthaver Monday told the National Feed Grain Association conference in Kansas City that abundant corn supplies and shrinking export markets will likely erode corn futures prices in the coming months.</p>
<p>Brunthaver was very bearish on exports.</p>
<p>He said good growing conditions in countries like Spain, China and South Korea will drastically reduce their corn import needs. "We should write them off as an importer (next year)," Brunthaver said, referring to China.</p>
<p>Corn closed 1/4 to three cents per bushel lower, with December down 1/4 at $2.66-1/2.  </p>
<p>There was scattered commission house and fund selling in corn but commercial buying underpinned the market.</p>
<p>Cargill Inc bought four million bushels of March and Term Commodities bought two million bushels of March, traders said.</p>
<p>Griffin Trading spread ten million bushels of July/March and Prudential Securities spread eleven million bushels of March/July, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated at 40,000 contracts, below the 41,562 traded Monday, according to the CBOT.</p>
<p>In corn options, LFG Futures bought 400 March $2.70 puts at 11 cents and Cargill Investor Services sold 500 December $2.30 puts at 6-1/4 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 12,000 contracts, up slightly from the 11,900 traded Monday.</p>
