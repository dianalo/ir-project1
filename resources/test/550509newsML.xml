<p>Bangchak Petroleum Plc has awarded one million barrels of Murban crude in its June buying tender, industry sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It awarded the barrels to Mitsubishi Corp on a Dubai pricing basis +$1.50 to $1.60 per barrel.</p>
<p>However, a refinery source said the refinery was valuing the Dubai-related price at the equivalent of ADNOC -20 cents.</p>
<p>Sources said the refiner may have taken at least one, but possible two other cargoes in the tender. The refiner declined to give details.</p>
<p>A source at the 120,000 barrels-per-day refinery said Bangchak did not plan to buy any regional light sweet grades in June because the Murban purchases now provided it with enough light grades for the month.</p>
<p>In its May buying tender, Bangchak awarded 750,000 barrels of Al Shaheem crude.</p>
