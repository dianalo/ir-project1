<p>BWT AG, Europe's leading manufacturer of water treatment technology, on Tuesday said group net profit in the first six months rose eight percent to 54.4 million schillings.</p>
<p>Sales in the first half rose to 1.29 billion schillings from 1.07 billion in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>BWT, in a press statement, traced the higher net profit to a more favourable tax on profits.</p>
<p>Pre-tax profit fell six percent due to a significantly lower financial result, BWT added. In the first half of 1996, BWT turned in a pre-tax profit of 96 million schillings, which included 40 million schillings from the flotation of its Swiss interest Christ.  </p>
<p>BWT said its new technology "AQA total", which treats water without the use of salt and chemicals, would this year bring in extra sales of 60 million schillings, but that this would rise to 200 million in 1998 and notch up earnings of 56 million. -- Vienna newsroom, +431 531 12256</p>
