<p>The United States on Saturday applauded Denmark's plan to table a resolution on China's human rights record at the U.N. Human Rights Commission and offered to co-sponsor the measure.</p>
<p>"This decision by Denmark reflects its principled commitment to the universality of human rights. The U.S. intends to co-sponsor this resolution," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said in a statement.</p>
<p>Burns said the U.N. Human Rights Commission, currently in session in Geneva, was "an especially appropriate venue for discussion of China's human rights practices."</p>
<p>Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, last week said Washington hoped to be part of a resolution after telling the commission China "continues to commit widespread and well-documented human rights abuses."</p>
<p>"It has been our hope that the Chinese government would make sufficient progress on human rights to render a resolution unnecessary, but in the absence of greater forward movement we will, as we have in years past, join with other members of the international community in an effort to bring the resolution to the floor and to a vote," Burns said.</p>
<p>In London, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind also welcomed the Danish decision and said Britain would join the United States in co-sponsoring the resolution.</p>
<p>"It is important that international attention is focused on the need for improvement in China's human rights situation," Rifkind said in a statement.</p>
<p>For the past six years China has fought off the introduction of a resolution on its rights record by winning majority support in the commission for a "no action" motion, and diplomats say it is well positioned to succeed again.</p>
<p>Richardson last week said he would be engaged in "quite active lobbying" against the "no action" motion and would aim at what he called "eight or nine swing votes that are moving rapidly" in a bid to defeat it.</p>
<p>U.S. officials say China continues to severely restrict fundamental freedoms of speech, the press, assembly, association and religion, in violation of internationally accepted norms.</p>
<p>Separately, National Security Adviser Samuel Berger said Washington still wanted Congress to approve renewal of China's Most-Favored-Nation trading status. Cutting off economic ties, he said, was not the best way to influence China's direction.</p>
<p>"We believe that engaging with China ... to deal directly with them, and confront them on the areas, where we disagree is better than breaking ourselves off from one quarter of the world's population," Berger told CNN's "Evans &amp; Novak" program.</p>
