<title>FRANCE: French stocks drop despite small rate cut.</title>
<headline>French stocks drop despite small rate cut.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS 1996-12-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>French shares closed 1.3 percent lower on the weakness in Wall Street and higher than expected U.S. November housing starts, and despite a slight cut in interest rates by the Bank of France.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed down 28.87 points or 1.3 percent at 2,193.70 while the CAC-40 futures contract was down at 2,195 from 2,227.5 on Monday's close.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said the French market had entered a "danger" zone and would continue to drop in the coming days, seeking support for the CAC-40 index at 2,165 and 2,145.</p>
<p>Volume was 5.35 billion francs.  </p>
<p>Dealers said investors had been sidelined and were awaiting the outcome of the Federal Open Market Commitee (FOMC) meeting even though no U.S. rate change is expected. After the FOMC, Thursday's Bundesbank meeting will keep people on their toes.</p>
<p>Paris opened weaker due to a fall on Wall Street towards the close due to a late selloff in technology stocks. The market drifted above its lows for most of the morning and got a brief shot in the arm from unexpected Bank of France rate cuts.</p>
<p>The independent central bank shaved its intervention rate to 3.15 percent from 3.20 percent and another less crucial rate, the five-to-10 day rate, to 4.60 percent from 4.75 percent.  </p>
<p>The publication of November housing starts, up 9.2 percent for the sharpest increase in over a year, sent shares down again and the decline was confirmed by a lower Wall Street opening.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial index cut its losses and even emerged into positive territory due to a rebound in the IBM share price. But Wall Street failed to lend much support to French stocks and an attempt to regain the 2,200 level for the CAC-40 was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The blue-chip index reached a day high of 2,220.70 after the French rate cuts and a low of 2,188.85 after the November housing starts.  </p>
<p>"It is very quiet, dealers are free-wheeling and many fund managers are already on holiday," a dealer said about activity, adding foreigners remained on the sidelines.</p>
<p>Bank of France governor Jean Claude Trichet presented the bank's monetary policy goals and said there would be no change in bank policy of targetting moderate money supply growth and currency stability in pursuit of price stability.</p>
<p>Trichet said the French economy could grow more than 2.5 percent in the medium term. Prime Minister Alain Juppe has said it would grow by at least 2.4 percent in 1997 and Finance Minister Jean Arthuis recently forecast growth of 2.3 percent.  </p>
<p>Jean Gandois, chairman of the employers' federation CNPF, told Reuters that 2.4 percent seemed to him "a bit optimistic".</p>
<p>French bonds closed lower and the franc was slightly weaker.</p>
<p>* Tobacco group Seita was one of the biggest gainers, closing up 2.3 percent at 215 francs. Portugal did not decide on the privatisation of the country's tobacco group today, and dealers cited the Seita chairman's recent remarks that tobacco would remain core business as supportive.</p>
<p>* Valeo rose 1.56 percent. Germany's Robert Bosch, a longtime ally, said the voting rights on its 5.1 percent stake in Valeo had risen to 9.4 percent from 4.96 percent.  </p>
<p>* LVMH fell 1.97 percent to 1,243 francs. The share was helped by a Japanese decision to reduce whiskey sales taxes, but the gain was more than offset by concerns about LVMH's proposed acquisition of DFS. LVMH said it has filed for regulatory approval to buy a controlling stake in the duty free chain with the U.S. FTC, a process that normally takes a month.</p>
<p>* Shoe retailer Groupe Andre gained 0.40 percent to 398.60 francs in reaction to a financial restructuring plan.</p>
<p>* Usinor-Sacilor drops 1.68 percent to 76 francs.</p>
<p>* Accor, down 0.64 percent to 625 francs, placed a 1.8 percent stake in Compass Group in London.  </p>
<p>* TF1 slipped 0.77 percent to 513 francs with French financial press focusing on the TPS digital satellite television venture which will not make a profit until 2000.</p>
<p>* Thomson-CSF, down 1.88 percent to 167 francs, has no comment on report in Le Monde that management wants a market sale of Thomson-CSF stake and not a private placement.</p>
<p>* CSFB reiterated its "buy" advice on AXA, up 0.86 percent to 304.80, with price target of 400 francs. Share swap offer on UAP, up 0.66 percent at 136.90, will close on Wednesday at 1600 GMT. The result will be announced January 13.</p>
