<p>The yen's weakness will likely be corrected if the weakness is based on market participants' belief that Japanese investors' money will continue to flow abroad, Eisuke Sakakibara, director-general of the Finance Ministry's International Finance Bureau, told a parliamentary committee on Monday.  </p>
<p>Sakakibara said there were expectations in the market that Japanese investors' funds would continue to flow overseas.</p>
<p>But he said recent current account data showed that such an outflow had not increased.</p>
<p>"If the market is pushing the yen weaker (on expectations that) Japanese money is flowing abundantly overseas, such expectations are different from the actual data.</p>
<p>"If expectations are different from the fact, then there is a possibility that (the market) will be corrected somewhere along the way," Sakakibara said.  </p>
<p>Sakakibara said current account data for January showed that Japanese investors were net sellers of foreign stocks.</p>
<p>He added that although foreign investors were net sellers of Japanese stocks in January, their large net purchases of Japanese bonds made them net buyers in overall securities investment in Japan.</p>
<p>The ministry said earlier on Monday that in 1996, net purchases of foreign stocks by Japanese investors totalled 929.5 billion yen, while their net purchases of foreign bonds totalled 8.3973 trillion yen.</p>
<p>In December alone, net purchases of foreign stocks by Japanese investors totalled 179.6 billion yen, and their net purchases of foreign bonds totalled 1.3466 trillion yen.</p>
<p>It said foreigners' net purchases of Japanese stocks in 1996 totalled 5.1083 trillion yen, and their net purchases of Japanese bonds totalled 3.8745 trillion yen.</p>
<p>In December alone, net purchases of Japanese stocks by foreign investors totalled 294.1 billion yen, and their net sales of Japanese bonds totalled 121.0 billion yen.  </p>
<p>Sakakibara also said that if market participants expected interest rates to rise, it would contribute to strength in the yen, while expectations that rates would remain at current levels or fall further would weaken the yen.</p>
<p>Market expectations on interest rates also depended on the markets' outlook on Japan's economy, he said.</p>
<p>Although market participants currently hold the view that market interest rates will continue to move at low levels, it is hard to predict what will happen in the future, he said.</p>
<p>Sakakibara also said Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Yasuo Matsushita has said that current economic conditions are good.</p>
<p>Sakakibara told the parliamentary committee that since market rates are formed from expectations of market participants, people should not make excessively pessimistic comments about the economy.</p>
