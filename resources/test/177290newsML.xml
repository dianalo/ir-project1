<p>Sources at German carmaker Volkswagen AG said on Friday that top executive Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua would remain with the carmaker even if he faces industrial espionage charges in a German court.</p>
<p>VW sources made the statement in response to a report in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung that said prosecutors would soon file charges against Lopez and three other top VW officials who followed him to the carmaker from rival Opel.</p>
<p>The four have been accused of taking secret documents with them when they left the unit of General Motors Corp in 1993 for VW, which is based in Wolfsburg.</p>
<p>VW has consistently denied the charges.</p>
