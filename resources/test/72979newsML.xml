<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa called on the international community on Tuesday to ensure Israel did not backslide in its negotiations with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Addressing the U.N. General Assembly, he said a recent meeting between Israel's new prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat expressed their recognition of each other as partners on an equal footing in the peace process.</p>
<p>But commitments made under previous accords have not been put into effect, he said, adding, "We are not keen to see handshakes or wide smiles being photographed but rather substantive developments."</p>
<p>"We call upon the entire world to follow up the matter with us in full vigilance and that it may not permit any retrogression or any manipulation with very sensitive and serious matters, namely the establishment of a permanent contractual peace between Palestine and Israel."</p>
<p>He said this should be a peace that fulfilled the national aspirations of the Palestinian people, culminating in the right to self-determination and the establishment of the state of Palestine, and one that created security for Israel and all parties on an equal footing and without discrimination.</p>
<p>He called on Israel to "desist from its settlement policy ... the policies of closure of territories and the siege of the Palestinian people, their starvation and the demolition of their houses."</p>
<p>"Israel is also called upon to put an end to its practices in Jerusalem, a city where any rights that could be claimed by Israel are outweighed by Arab rights which are more ancient, legitimate and authentic than many of the Israeli claims in the city," he said.</p>
<p>On stalled negotiations between Israel and Syria, he said, "I can say in all honesty and in full confidence that Syria is ready to resume the negotiations that Israel requested suspended last February." They should resume where they left off, he added.</p>
<p>Peace in the Middle East requires a regional system based on equal security for all parties, with minimum levels of armament, he said. He said the region must be free of all weapons of mass destruction -- nuclear, chemical or biological -- and their delivery systems.</p>
