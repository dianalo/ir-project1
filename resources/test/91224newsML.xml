<title>USA: "Yield burning" accounting service gets no takers.</title>

<p>A Minnesota accounting firm that offered last month to help localities calculate their "yield burning" liability under a recent IRS notice has gotten no takers, a firm spokesman said.</p>
<p>"The response has been underwhelming so far," Steven Barthe, an official with Barthe &amp; Wahrman in Bloomington said in a telephone inteview.</p>
<p>"We got a few calls. Some people expressed an interest. But nobody signed up," Barthe said, referring to a three-page letter his firm sent 625 localities nationwide on September 19.</p>
<p>In the letter, the firm offers to help issuers determine whether yield burning occurred and, if so, how much in penalties they may owe IRS.</p>
<p>Barthe &amp; Wahrman said it recently examined a refunding bond issue of less than $10 million and calculated a "yield burn" of over $100,000.</p>
<p>The firm added, "Failure to comply with the (IRS') Revenue Ruling could also result in the loss of the bond issue's tax exempt status."</p>
<p>David Walton, a partner with Jones Hall Hill &amp; White in San Francisco and a former IRS attorney, last week called Barthe &amp; Wahrman "opportunists."</p>
<p>He said IRS is studying the yield burning issue. Until it finishes, issuers should not "buckle under and send IRS a check."</p>
<p>But Barthe said IRS' recent decision to delay the enactment date of its ruling "does not change the tone of the revenue procedure."</p>
<p>"The revenue procedure is still in full force. It's just that the drop dead date is suspended. Municipalities are still very much at risk," Barthe said.</p>
<p>"If I were a municipality and the IRS were to undertake a spot examination, I certainly would want to know if there is exposure," Barthe said.</p>
<p>Barthe said his accounting firm does not specialize in municipal matters, and that is an advantage in this case since municipalities that get hit with IRS yield burning bills are likely to turn around and sue bond professionals.</p>
<p>"We are a good choice because we don't have a relationship with underwriters and bond counsel," he said.</p>
<p>Barthe said his firm selected the 625 issuers to receive its letter after consulting a database provided by a lawfirm familiar with municipalities that have done advance refundings. He would not disclose the name of the firm.</p>
