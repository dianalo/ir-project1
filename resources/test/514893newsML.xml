<p>German call money rates on Wednesday slipped below the 3.10 percent line for the first time in days, signalling smooth liquidity conditions even as the Bundesbank plans a considerable drain in funds.</p>
<p>"We are seeing more trades conducted at rates below 3.10 percent than we have in several days," one trader said halfway through Wednesday's session.</p>
<p>And while the bulk of trades was still being conducted at 3.10 percent, dealers said the day's range of 3.07/3.10 percent was clearly below Tuesday's 3.10/3.12 percent range.  </p>
<p>But the slight dip in rates should not be interpreted as foreshadowing renewed hopes for a German rate cut, dealers said on the eve of the Bundesbank's policy setting council meeting.</p>
<p>Rather the moves were triggered by technical factors, dealers said, explaining that the so-called Tuesday float buoyed monthly reserve holdings, allowing dealers a bit more breathing room in today's trading.</p>
<p>"Reserve numbers are pretty good because of the float, and so the situation has become a bit more relaxed," a dealer said.</p>
<p>Banks held 41.7 billion marks on Tuesday, up from 39.8 billion marks held on Monday.  </p>
<p>Average monthly holdings totalled 41.0 billion marks on Tuesday, down slightly form 41.1 billion marks a day earlier.</p>
<p>Dealers said it was still difficult to evaluate how the Bundesbank's announcement today that it would drain 9.1 billion marks from the system tomorrow would affect rates.</p>
<p>"We will have to see how this is offset by the transfer of Bundesbank profits to the government," a dealer explained.</p>
<p>Every year the Bundesbank awards a portion of its annual profits to the government which in turn uses the money to pare back debt. Some of these funds are then returned to the money market.  </p>
<p>Economists said they see a smaller profit in 1996 than 1995's 10.928 billion mark result. Some 10.318 billion marks of that profit was sent to Bonn.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank will detail its 1996 results at a news conference beginning at 1200 GMT on Thursday.</p>
<p>On Tuesday banks' borrowings at the emergency Lombard borrowing facility were again negligible.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt Interbank Overnight Average (FIONA) was set at 3.12400 percent on Wednesday after 3.13033 percent on Tuesday.</p>
