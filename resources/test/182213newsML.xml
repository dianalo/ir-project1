<p>The Polish construction company Budimex SA cut its 1996 pre-tax profit forecast to 19-20 million zlotys from earlier expected 33 million, because of a harsh winter slow-down earlier this year, the firm said.</p>
<p>It said in a Tuesday statement its net profit was likely to reach 18-19 million zlotys in 1996.</p>
<p>The company said its earnings were expected to be lower also because of lowering profits from its contracts on Eastern markets, but did not give details.</p>
<p>It said its sales were likely to amount to 265 million zlotys this year, down from earlier forecasted 285 million.</p>
<p>It said its consolidated pre-tax profit was likely to amount to 25-27 million zlotys.</p>
