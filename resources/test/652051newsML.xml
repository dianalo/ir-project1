<p>French car maker Renault will announce today that the planned closure of its plant in Vilvoorde, Belgium will be delayed, Belgian daily Le Soir said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some 1,000 to 1,500 workers of the assembly plant, which is scheduled to be closed on July 31, will go to Paris today to join a march for jobs. Renault's board and shareholders, including the French state, are due to meet later today.    </p>
<p>The new leftwing French government -- whose Socialist partner had promised to reconsider the decision to close the plant during its election campaign -- has several representatives on the board of the carmaker. </p>
<p>Renault is 46-percent state-owned.</p>
<p>On Saturday Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene met his French counterpart Lionel Jospin to discuss the closure. Dehaene said Jospin would disclose his stance this week after "clearing up" his position.</p>
<p>Dehaene, who lives in Vilvoorde, has branded the planned closure as "unacceptable."    </p>
<p>French daily Le Figaro, citing trade union sources, said on Tuesday the closure of Vilvoorde might be delayed by six months.</p>
<p>French Economy Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said in Paris on Monday that he foresaw a positive outcome to the controversial plan, but gave no details.</p>
<p>Aides to Jospin have been in contact with Renault over the fast few days and have said Renault could disclose results of the talks possibly on Tuesday.</p>
<p>From Paris a Renault spokesman said on Tuesday it had no comment on the planned closure of Vilvoorde.</p>
<p>Renault's announcement in February that it would close the plant with a loss of 3,100 jobs sparked angry demonstrations in Belgium.</p>
<p>The protest spread to other plants when the company announced further jobs cuts to curb overcapacity and costs and restore profitability.</p>
<p>It turned into a Europe-wide call on governments and the European Union to redirect part of their attention to dealing with unemployment and other social affairs and concentrate less on the single currency and economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
