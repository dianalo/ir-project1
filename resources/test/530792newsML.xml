<p>White House budget director Franklin Raines said Wednesday the U.S. economy is doing better than projections by the Congressional Budget Office and the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p>The difference in economic forecasts between the OMB and CBO can be a sore point in budget talks because it affects the amount of deficit reduction that needs to take place to balance the budget.</p>
<p>"I think the facts are going to win that argument. The facts are that the economy is performing better than CBO projected and better than we projected," Raines said.  </p>
<p>Raines said that there would not be any further substantive negotiations on the budget until after President Clinton meets with House and Senate Democrats this week.</p>
<p>Raines said that he did not see any specific deadline by which budget negotiations had to be resolved.</p>
<p>"I don't plan that we'll go on indefinitely, but I also don't see any one date as being crucial," Raines told reporters.</p>
<p>Raines added that "now we've got to get into narrowing the differences and ultimately the president and the leaders, I think, will have to be involved to close the deal."  </p>
<p>The administration is currently considering some of the comment that congressional budget negotiators have made with regard to items in the budget, Raines said.</p>
<p>He said one rule in the budget negotiations is that none of the participants rule anything in or out that is being discussed.</p>
<p>He added that the administration was "quite comfortable" with its stance on Medicare. The White House has proposed $100 billion in savings in Medicare over five years.</p>
<p>"There's a difference on discretionary spending and it is one that will have to be resolved before we have an agreement," Raines said.</p>
<p>On a capital gains tax cut, Raines said the administration has not been convinced yet that it is "necessary from an economic standpoint. We understand that it has a lot of political appeal to Republicans and therefore have been prepared to listen and learn about their views on that."</p>
