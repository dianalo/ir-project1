<p>Japan's "Fugen" prototype reactor will resume operations at 6 p.m. (0900 GMT) on Thursday, a spokesman for the reactor operator said.</p>
<p>It has been shut since April after plant officials failed to report an accident promptly.  </p>
<p>"We plan to restart the unit at 6 o'clock this afternoon and power generation will start at around 2 p.m. (0500 GMT) tomorrow," said the spokesman for the operator, the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel Development Corp (PNC).</p>
<p>On April 15 the government ordered PNC to halt operations at the 165,000-kilowatt reactor on the Sea of Japan coast after learning that the state-run firm had waited 30 hours before reporting a radiation leak at the plant which occurred the previous day.</p>
<p>The Science and Technology Agency on Tuesday approved the restart of the unit after the PNC submitted a report to the agency saying it would take steps to improve the flow of information.  </p>
<p>The reactor is scheduled for routine maintenance checks starting in early to mid-August, and PNC will bring it back on line in early November, he said.</p>
<p>The unit supplies electricity to three regional power utilities -- Kansai Electric Power Co Inc, Chubu Electric Power Co Inc and Hokuriku Electric Power Co Inc.</p>
