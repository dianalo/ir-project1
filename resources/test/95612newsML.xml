<p>Media baron Rupert Murdoch said on</p>
<p>Friday he would launch his rebel Super League in Australia next</p>
<p>year after winning a stunning legal victory over rugby league's</p>
<p>established order.</p>
<p>Murdoch was freed to start his breakaway league when</p>
<p>Australia's Federal Court overturned an earlier ruling banning</p>
<p>his competition from kicking off here before the year 2000.</p>
<p>Britain, a Super League ally, immediately moved to organise</p>
<p>an international fixture later this month against an Australian</p>
<p>side featuring players under contract to Murdoch.</p>
<p>Murdoch himself promised to transform a sport that is coming</p>
<p>increasingly under his control around the world.</p>
<p>"Super League represents a new dimension in international</p>
<p>sport and 1997 will see the finest rugby league competition ever</p>
<p>created," he said in a statement issued in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The legal victory, immediately freeing eight existing clubs</p>
<p>and more than 200 players to defect to Super League, means there</p>
<p>will almost certainly be two rival leagues in Australia in 1997.</p>
<p>But it does not spell the end of a bitter, protracted power</p>
<p>struggle with the Australian Rugby League (ARL), the established</p>
<p>domestic ruling body which runs an existing competition.</p>
<p>Several hours after the court ruling, ARL chairman Ken</p>
<p>Arthurson said his organisation would seek leave to appeal the</p>
<p>decision in Australia's highest court.</p>
<p>Murdoch thanked the players and clubs who he said had stood</p>
<p>by him during the battle.</p>
<p>"They have never lost faith in our belief in what rugby</p>
<p>league could and should become: a truly international sport," he</p>
<p>said. Murdoch has already invested A$270 million (US$213</p>
<p>million) in Super League.</p>
<p>The eight clubs now free to join Super League are Brisbane</p>
<p>Broncos, Canberra Raiders, Cronulla Sharks, Auckland Warriors,</p>
<p>Western Reds, Sydney Bulldogs, North Queensland and Penrith.</p>
<p>A host of prominent international players are also</p>
<p>contracted to Super League, including former test scrumhalf</p>
<p>Ricky Stuart and backs Laurie Daley and Andrew Ettingshausen.</p>
<p>English Rugby Football League chief executive Maurice</p>
<p>Lindsay said he wanted wanted to add the match against</p>
<p>Australia's Super League side to Britain's current South Pacific</p>
<p>tour.</p>
<p>"We are going to discuss the matter with our Australian</p>
<p>colleagues and try and find a venue and a date in October to</p>
<p>have an inaugural game between Great Britain and Australia Super</p>
<p>League," Lindsay said from London in an interview on Australian</p>
<p>Broadcasting Corporation radio.</p>
<p>Britain and New Zealand, the two major rugby league playing</p>
<p>nation alongside outside Australia, joined the Super League camp</p>
<p>in early 1995, several months after Murdoch's plans first became</p>
<p>public. Murdoch's BSkyB satellite and cable television already</p>
<p>screens the European version of the Super League.</p>
