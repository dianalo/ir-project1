<p>Bullet-riddled bodies lay in a row as dozens of women and children wailed on Saturday in a Kashmir village where unidentified gunmen shot dead seven Hindus.</p>
<p>The blood-soaked bodies were lying in the compound of a house in Sangrampur village, some 20 km (12.5 miles) southwest of Srinagar, summer capital of the troubled Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>Nearby villages and towns observed a complete shutdown to mourn the killings that took place on Friday night.</p>
<p>"Late last night there was a knock on our door. When we opened the door two gunmen entered and asked for the male members and said that some security officer wanted to talk to them," a wailing Sunita Bhat told Reuters.</p>
<p>"My husband, Sanjay Bhat went along with them. The  next moment he was dead," she said in choked voice, wiping tears from her eyes.</p>
<p>The Himalayan hamlet that nestles among pine forests was swarming with police and paramilitary men, but wore a ghost look.</p>
<p>The village houses only ten families, two of whom are Moslem and the rest Kashmiri Hindus, called Pandits in the region, where Moslem separatists have been waging a seven-year-old rebellion against New Delhi's rule.</p>
<p>"A group of a fifteen gunmen encircled the Pandit houses and forced eight males out of their houses and told everybody that some security officer wanted to see them," said J.B. Singh, a senior police officer who was investigating the incident.</p>
<p>The militants then fired indiscriminately on them just 50 metres (yards) away from the village, and the victims died on the spot, Singh said.</p>
<p>A group of Moslem villagers led by a senior leader of the multi-party separatist All-Parties Hurriyat (freedom) Conference, Mohammad Yasin Malik, lit the pyre of seven bodies according to Hindu customs.</p>
<p>"I feel my brothers have been killed, so it is my duty to do the last rites," Malik said. "It is painful. We the Moslem majority are the the custodians of the Hindu minority here."</p>
<p>More than 300,000 Hindus fled the Kashmir valley, the hotbed of the separatist war in mainly Hindu India's only Moslem majority province, after the rebellion broke out in 1990.</p>
<p>A small number remained in the valley, among them the victims who were killed on Friday. More than 20,000 people have been killed since 1990 in incidents linked to separatism in Kashmir.</p>
<p>"We feel guilty. Why did we stop them in 1990? It is a gruesome act," said Ghulam Mohideen, a local resident.</p>
<p>Chuni Lal, who lost his son in the incident was still in shock.</p>
<p>"What is wrong with you? Why don't you get up?," he asked as he held his dead son's head on his lap.</p>
