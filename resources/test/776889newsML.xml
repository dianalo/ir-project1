<p>The European Union's Middle East envoy on Monday blasted Israeli moves against Palestinians imposed after a bombing at an Israeli market last week that killed 13 people.</p>
<p>Peace envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos, speaking to reporters after meeting Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in the Gaza Strip, said he would try to persuade Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to lift some of the measures.</p>
<p>"The EU is supporting all measures which can bring security to the Israelis but we cannot really understand some measures that instead of bringing security are bringing insecurity," Moratinos said at a joint news conference with Arafat.</p>
<p>"I will try to persuade Prime Minister Netanyahu that some certain measures have to be reconsidered," he said, adding that both Palestinians and Israelis had to fight "terror".</p>
<p>Moratinos was to meet Netanyahu at 2 p.m. (1100 GMT) in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>"No doubt the peace process faces very serious challenges as a result of these illegal acts which are inhumane in some parts," Arafat said.</p>
<p>"These are collective punishment against the Palestinian people aimed to humiliate the Palestinian people but they must know that no one can humiliate the Palestinian people."</p>
<p>The Israeli government suspended peace talks with the Palestinians in reaction to Wednesday's attack and sealed off the West Bank and Gaza Strip, preventing tens of thousands of Palestinians from reaching their jobs in the Jewish state.</p>
<p>It also threatened to enter Palestinian self-rule areas to fight militants if Arafat did not do the job. Palestinians say they have fought militants opposed to the peace process.</p>
<p>A leaflet in the name of the Islamic Hamas group claimed responsibility for the double bombing in Jerusalem, though both Israeli and Palestinian officials say they are not sure of its authenticity.</p>
<p>Netanyahu told his cabinet on Sunday that Israel would not honour peace deals it signed with Arafat unless the Palestinian president cracked down on militants.</p>
<p>He later told CBS-TV's "Face the Nation": "The whole peace is at stake. Arafat must make a choice and make it now."</p>
