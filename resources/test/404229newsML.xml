<p>American War of Independence.</p>

<p>first person sentenced to death in New South Wales.</p>
<p>    1881 :    The Boers defeated the British at the Battle of</p>

<p>    1902 :    Two Australian officers were executed in South</p>
<p>Africa. Lieutenants HARRY HARBORD 'BREAKER' MORANT and PETER JOSEPH HANDCOCK were shot by firing squad after they were sentenced to death by a British High Command court for having shot a Boer prisoner. Another officer GEORGE WITTON was given a life sentence. MORANT was a well-known Sydney writer who wrote under the nom de plume "The Breaker". He was reputed to be an excellent horseman. HANDCOCK was a veterinary surgeon from  </p>
<p>Western Australia. The execution order was controversial and at the time it was believed that their actions were understandable due to the fact that the Boers had been responsible for atrocities. Community opinion prompted WITTON's early release.</p>
