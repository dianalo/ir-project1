<p>Britain's Glaxo Wellcome Plc said on Thursday that it is selling its pharmaceutical production plant in Greenville, North Carolina, U.S. to Catalytica Pharmaceuticals Inc for 150 million stg.  </p>
<p>The drugs giant said in a statement that the cash proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce group borrowings.</p>
<p>Glaxo will also receive 250,000 shares of preferred stock in Catalytica, plus warrants to purchase two million shares of common stock at $12 per share.</p>
<p>Glaxo added that it may also share in the operating profits from Catalytica Pharmaceuticals' operation of the sterile products facility at the Greenville site up to a maximum 15 million stg.</p>
<p>It will also continue to source products from the site for the next five years at a cost of around 488 million stg.</p>
<p>The sale is set to close by the end of July and Catalytica is expected to keep a "substantial majority" of the 1,100 workers at the plant.</p>
