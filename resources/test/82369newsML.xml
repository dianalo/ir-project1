<p>German shares came off lows in late trade on Friday after a bout of profit-taking and, while dealers said some consolidation was possible, were seen pushing past recent record-highs towards the end of next week.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index of all day electronic trade traded 4.40 points lower at 2,660.56, some five points off earlier lows, as Wall Street was seen opening mixed to higher after second quarter U.S. GDP figures fell in line with forecasts.</p>
<p>"There's going to be some consolidation but at least volumes are starting to pick up again," said one dealer, adding there was little danger of the market losing recent gains.  </p>
<p>The dollar, currently trading at 1.5225/35 to the mark, was still seen as one of the key supportive factors in the market.</p>
<p>The banking sector, which has seen some losses in recent days following concern over statements from the Moody's credit rating service interpreted as negative for the shares, was nonetheless seen as unlikely to lose further.</p>
<p>"Even if you take into account the effect that recent takeover speculation has had on the shares, they have still underperformed relative to the market so far," one trader said.</p>
<p>German shares were further seen benefiting from a more positive attitude among investors towards continental Europe.</p>
