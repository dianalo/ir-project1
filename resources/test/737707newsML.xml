<p>Foreign banks offered to extend loans to the Philippine central bank to help build buffer its international reserves, central bank governor Gabriel Singson said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Singson, however, declined the offers, saying the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had promised to make available a total of $1.050 billion under the existing Extended Fund Facility.</p>
<p>He added another $400 million is available under a parallel financing by the Japan Export-Import Bank.</p>
<p>"As compared to 1983, our credit remains good ... I have received several offers from foreign banks," Singson told reporters.</p>
<p>"I was made to understand that it's going to be easy for them to raise the money."</p>
<p>"I said 'I don't need it,'" he added.</p>
<p>Singson said the central bank has not made a decision on whether to draw down the IMF loan.</p>
<p>The Philippine gross international reserves had been whittled down to $9.7 billion as of Monday after selling more than $1.5 billion to defend the peso since the start of the month.</p>
