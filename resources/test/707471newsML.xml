<p>Tokyo prosecutors arrested a former chairman of Dai-ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd Friday over a racketeer payoff scandal involving the bank and giant brokerage Nomura Securities Co.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Tadashi Okuda, 65, was suspected of approving loans worth 11.7 billion yen to Ryuichi Koike, the "sokaiya" racketeer at the heart of the scandal. The loans were made through an affiliate firm between between 1994 and 1996.</p>
<p>Okuda's arrest, which brought the number of DKB officials arrested in the widening affair to 11, followed the suicide of his predecessor, Kuniji Miyazaki on June 29. Prosecutors had been questioning Miyazaki as a key figure in the case.</p>
<p>Prosecutors on Friday also charged former DKB vice president Ichiro Fujita and former director Takeo Fukushima with allegedly extending 7.35 billion yen in loans to Koike through the affiliate, Daiwa Shinyo, between July 1995 and September 1996.</p>
<p>DKB, in a statement, again apologised for the scandal and promised to do its best to win back customer trust.</p>
<p>Okuda resigned as chairman of DKB, one of Japan's biggest banks, in May as part of a massive management shake-up prompted by the scandal.</p>
<p>The affair has unfolded just as Japan kicks off its "Big Bang" reforms of its long-protected financial sector -- a fact that has made authorities keen to take a tough stance.</p>
<p>Both DKB and Nomura have suffered customer defections and face possible stiff administrative penalties in addition to the criminal case.</p>
<p>Sokaiya, often linked to "yakuza" gangsters, extort money from companies by threatening to disclose management misdeeds or disrupt annual shareholders meetings. Payoffs to the corporate extortionists have been illegal since 1983 but many firms have found it hard to cut ties to the underworld.</p>
<p>Financial sources said Japan's securities watchdog, the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission, could make its recommendations on administrative punishment of Nomura to the Finance Ministry late next week.</p>
<p>The penalties could include the suspension of some of the brokerage's business for up to six months.</p>
<p>Finance Ministry officials mulling what penalties to slap on DKB, however, are finding it tough to figure out how to punish the bank without hurting its customers.</p>
<p>"Banks are a key part of the economic system and comprise the settlement system, and measures could have a great impact on depositors and small- and medium-sized firms which are borrowers, so we are studying what kind of measures are possible," Sei Nakai, deputy director of the ministry's banking bureau, told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>Worries that the scandal might widen gave the Tokyo stock market the jitters earlier this week after Koike told prosecutors that three more big securities houses had done illegal deals on his behalf.</p>
