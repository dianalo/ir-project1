<headline>US OPTIONS FOCUS/Stores' merger speculation rises.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-02-13</dateline>

<p>Speculation on whether a merger between office superstores Staples Inc and Office Depot Inc would be completed rose sharply Thursday and options volume rose as a result, traders said.</p>
<p>"There was all kinds of speculation on whether this deal would go through or not and people were using the options to hedge their risk every which way," said Andrew Schwarz, senior partner at AGS Specialist Partners.</p>
<p>He referred to Office Depot options, which traded heavily on the American Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>Frank McGarvey of TFM Investment Group, the specialist unit for Staples options at the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, said recent action in Staples stock suggested investors are expecting a delay.</p>
<p>"Market activity in Staples -- both in the stock and the options -- suggests that there may be a delay in the deal beyond March, which I think most people were expecting," he said.</p>
<p>He added that the market activity suggests some see the deal possibly being pushed out to June.  </p>
<p>The two companies have special shareholder meetings scheduled for February 27 to vote on the merger, which was announced last September.</p>
<p>A report Wednesday said Federal Trade Commision staffers may recommend that the full commission block the merger.</p>
<p>But Staples chief executive Thomas Stemberg said Thursday that FTC staff had made no decision on whether to recommend blocking the merger and that there had been no talk with FTC staff on divesting some stores as a condition of merger.</p>
<p>Staples shares finished up 15/16 at 20-15/16 after reaching 21-3/8. Volume totaled nearly 5.4 million shares.  </p>
<p>Office Depot, among the most active issues on the New York Stock Exchange, lost 5/8 to 19-1/4 on turnover of more than four million shares. Consolidated volume topped 4.6 million.</p>
<p>The heaviest Office Depot options activity was in the March and April 20 calls, which traded about 13,900 and 14,050 contracts, respectively.</p>
<p>Most of that was a large spread, traders said.</p>
<p>But other busy options included the March 15, 17-1/2 and 20 puts as well as the April 22-1/2 calls.  </p>
<p>The two most active Staples options were the March 20 call, with volume of 8,530 contracts, and the March 22-1/2 call, with volume of 4,225.</p>
<p>Busy Staples puts included the March 20, with volume of 3,965, the March 20, with volume of 2,100, and the February 22-1/2, with volume of nearly 2,100.</p>
