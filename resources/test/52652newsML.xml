<p>Shares of Mexican glassmaker Vitro SA were higher in late trade following news it reached an agreement to sell assets from its troubled unit Anchor Glass Corp.</p>
<p>Vitro shares were up 4.94 percent to 17 pesos per share on the Mexican bourse while its ADRs had climbed 1/4 to $6-3/4.</p>
<p>Vitro said it had signed a tentative agreement to sell Anchor's assets to Ball-Foster Glass Container Co. To assure its continued operations until the sale, Anchor's board of directors voluntarily filed a petition for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Vitro said.  </p>
<p>"This should help Vitro because it eases its debt load," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Vitro had said last month it intended to sell Anchor and would focus on its core glass businesses, which it said were very profitable.</p>
