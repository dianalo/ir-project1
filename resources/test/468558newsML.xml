<p>Romania's soccer federation (FRF) on Wednesday banned Steaua Bucharest's president Marcel Puscas for a year over his accusations that the federation had illegally taken a percentage of payments for foreign transfers.</p>
<p>Federation deputy general secretary Cristian Bivolaru said Puscas had been barred from all activity in the sport for a year and fined more than $7000 for "libellous statements".</p>
<p>Puscas, appointed Steaua president four months ago, accused the FRF in a series of interviews of illegally taking 10 percent from each player's transfer money.</p>
<p>He alleged that the Federation took a similar cut from Steaua's games in the European Champions' League and said the system was in violation of FIFA and UEFA regulations.</p>
<p>Last week, Puscas said Steaua, currently second in the league, had paid out a total of $920,000 to the FRF.</p>
<p>The FRF said the practice was a normal one, with the funds being used to train junior players.</p>
<p>Eight first division teams have formally asked the FRF to return sums of money in connection with transfers abroad. A senior official of Universitatea Craiova last week said his club were seeking the return of $500,000.</p>
