<p>Banc One Corp. said Monday it agreed to buy First USA Inc. for about $6.7 billion in a stock transaction that will double its U.S. credit card operations and open up avenues for new business.</p>
<p>Banc One said its combination with First USA will form the third-largest credit card operation in the country with about 32 million cardholders and assets of $35 billion.</p>
<p>It said it agreed to pay 1.1659 shares of Banc One common stock for each share of Dallas-based First USA, which is one of the four biggest banks in the country that specialize in credit card lending.</p>
<p>Based on Banc One's Monday closing price of $41.50 on the New York Stock Exchange, which was down $3.625 from Friday, the deal would be worth about $6.7 billion.</p>
<p>While industry analysts noted that Banc One was paying a steep premium for First USA, they said the deal could produce big returns for Banc One, which is based in Columbus, Ohio.</p>
<p>"It gives them a tremendous amount of power in writing new business, particulary asset-backed securities," Robert Bonelli, executive vice president at Ernst &amp; Co., said, referring to credit card portfolios that are securitized and sold to third parties.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be looking at the combination squeezing out expenses. Instead, I would look at the degree of critical mass that will allow them to do a large amount of new business," Bonelli said.</p>
<p>Banc One has a long history of making and successfully integrating acquisitions. Most of its 100-plus acquisitions over three decades were stock swaps that did not slow earnings momentum.</p>
<p>Banc One Monday reported record 1996 earnings of $1.4 billion, or $3.23 a share, vs. $1.3 billion, or $2.91 a share, in 1995.</p>
<p>However, Banc One's share price slipped due to concerns about a reduction in earnings as a result of the merger.</p>
<p>First USA's stock soared $8.875 to $45.625.</p>
<p>Analysts agreed that Banc One was paying a steep price -- more than six times First USA's book value of about $8.50 a share and more than 20 times earnings.</p>
<p>But they also said that well-publicized problems in credit card lending, chiefly rising delinquency and charge-off rates, did not detract from the profitability of the business.</p>
<p>Nancy Bush of Brown Brothers Harriman said profitability in cards was about twice that in banking generally.</p>
<p>Fred Cummings, an analyst with McDonald &amp; Co., said the deal was a good long-term strategic move for Banc One but will cut into earnings in 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p>Kathryn Bissette, analyst at  Sterne, Agee &amp; Leach, said only 1997 should be affected.</p>
<p>"Given the higher growth rate (of) revenues and earnings at First USA, they should be able to overcome the earnings dilution in a reasonable time," Bissette said.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, Banc One also will buy First USA Paymentech Inc., a credit card payments processing business of which 57 percent is owned by First USA.</p>
<p>First USA has 16 million cardholders and managed receivables worth $22.4 billion while Banc One also has 16 million cardholders and $12.6 billion in managed receivables.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to be completed by May 31.</p>
<p>Bonelli said while the percentage of credit card debt that banks are forced to write off has been creeping up, "consumers are managing their credit today better than ever before."</p>
<p>He said with credit card rates of around 13.5 percent for the most creditworthy borrowers and rates in the 16 percent range for many people, the result is strong returns in the card business.</p>
<p>Banc One, the 10th largest U.S. bank with assets of $101.8 billion at year-end, operates 1,502 branches in 12 states.</p>
<p>Formed in 1968 by the merger of two Ohio banks, by 1988 it had bought about 60 well-run, small to mid-sized banks in Ohio and surrounding states and its assets placed it in the top 50 banks.</p>
<p>In 1989, Banc One stunned the industry by acquiring MCorp, a major Texas bank that had been seized by U.S. regulators. It was Banc One's largest acquisition to date with a price tag around $500 million, in an entirely new market.</p>
