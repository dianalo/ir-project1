<p>Finnish media group Ilkka Oy's CEO Erkki Poranen said on Thursday he did not know the identity of the overseas investor or investors who in December acquired more than 5.5 percent of shares in the company.</p>
<p>"I don't know," Poranen told Reuters in response to a question.</p>
<p>According to statistics released by the Central Share Register (OKR) on Tuesday, foreign holdings in Ilkka rose to 7.13 percent of shares at end-December from 1.60 percent at end-November.  </p>
<p>Poranen said foreign investors hold 95,000 II-series shares.</p>
<p>Ilkka's II-series shares carry one vote per share, while its I-series shares carry 20 votes each.</p>
<p>Ilkka shares have risen sharply since the company released its January-August report on October 22. On Thursday at 1620/1420 GMT, Ilkka's II-share traded at 150.00 markka, up from a 129.00 markka closing on October 22.</p>
