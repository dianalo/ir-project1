<p>Pediatrix Medical Group Inc said Monday it has acquired Neonatology Associates of New Mexico, P.C.  The cash transaction will have an immediate positive impact on Pediatrix' earnings per share, it said.</p>
<p>The New Mexico group practice provides services to a large Level III neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in Albuquerque which generated approximately 12,000 patient days during 1996. This transaction marks Pediatrix' entry into the State of New Mexico.</p>
<p>The transaction was funded from Pediatrix' cash reserves, which currently approximate $70 million.</p>
<p>Since January 1,  Pediatrix has added a total of seven new units, including the New Mexico acquisition, through a combination of internal marketing and acquisition.  For all of 1996, Pediatrix added a total of 41 units, primarily through acquisition of group practices.  Pediatrix is a provider of physician practice management services to hospital-based NICUs.</p>
<p>The company provides services to 75 NICUs, eight pediatric intensive units (PICUs) and three pediatric departments in 18 states and Puerto Rico and employs or contracts with approximately 210 physicians.</p>
