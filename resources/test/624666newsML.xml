<p>Finnish warehouse truck maker Rocla Oy said in a statement it had halted on Thursday the institutional and retail tranches of its share offering as subscription commitments exceeded 11 times the amount of shares on offer.</p>
<p>"The reason for the suspension is the strong demand for the shares," Rocla said.</p>
<p>"Institutional and retail shareholders made purchase and subscription commitments for about 21 million Rocla shares, which is 11 times the number of shares originally made available," it said.</p>
<p>Rocla said it expected the listing of its shares to start on the Helsinki stock exchange on or about June 17.</p>
