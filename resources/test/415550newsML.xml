<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-03-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dutch chartists said on Monday</p>
<p>they remained divided between a neutral and slightly upbeat</p>
<p>stance on the AEX stock market index in the coming week.</p>
<p>"We stick to our neutral stance," said ING Barings, adding a</p>
<p>break below 737 points would further delay any positive scope.</p>
<p>The index slipped to a low of 733.02 points in Monday</p>
<p>morning trade, but recovered to almost 737 points by late</p>
<p>afternoon.</p>
<p>It rose 8.54 points to close at 737.46 points on Friday,</p>
<p>after briefly touching a new all-time high of 755.73 points on</p>
<p>Wednesday.</p>

<p>Note - Contributors' own analysis follows.</p>
<p>ING Barings - The AEX, falling below its support level at</p>
<p>742.50 shows slowly weakening technicals. As the AEX is forming</p>
<p>a trading range within the boundaries of its rising trend</p>
<p>channel, we stick to our neutral stance. A break below 737.00</p>
<p>points would further delay a positive scope. Then look for a</p>
<p>knee-jerk towards the lower side of teh rising trend channel at</p>
<p>715-720. A break above 742 is required to have the uptrend</p>
<p>resumed. The technical indicators of the AEX confirm a neutral</p>
<p>short term outlook. Momentum is petering out, indicating that</p>
<p>the bull train is running out of steam. </p>
<p>Money flow indicators of the Amsterdam stock market are</p>
<p>levelling off, suggesting that buyers are becoming less</p>
<p>aggressive. The advantage/decline ratio (in measurement of</p>
<p>market breadth) is forming a minor top, suggesting that market</p>
<p>is lacking leadership.</p>
<p>RABO SECURITIES - AEX weakened by the price action of last</p>
<p>Friday and fell back in its former rising trend channel. We</p>
<p>expect it to test the lower boundary of its rising trend channel</p>
<p>and bounce back. This resistance is at approximately 724. This</p>
<p>correction can be used to expand long positions. Long term trend</p>
<p>intact and we expect to end week at approximately same level.</p>
<p>MEESPIERSON - Due to worsening short term indicators we stay</p>
<p>neutral for this week. The AEX is expected to stay in the</p>
<p>period of consolidation which formed from last week on.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO - Last week's correction in the AEX has brought us</p>
<p>to lower price levels without harming any upward potential. This</p>
<p>move was just a search for support in a nervous market. At the</p>
<p>moment, we see the index bottoming out above 730, after which we</p>
<p>expect the AEX to place a renewed attack on 740 in the first</p>
<p>place after which the previous top comes in sight. Subsequently,</p>
<p>our short-term indicators are starting to turn upward again.</p>
<p>This implies that the correction is passing.</p>
<p>However, we need more confirmation before we advice to</p>
<p>re-enter long positions. This confirmation is found when we see</p>
<p>prices that reach above the 742 level.</p>
<p>There we see the end of the short term down move which was</p>
<p>initiated at the top last week.</p>
<p>Therefore, we state that staying neutral is the best way to</p>
<p>cope with present situation on the AEX. However, when we take a</p>
<p>look at the underlying stocks that form the AEX, we can conclude</p>
<p>that there is no real danger of lower prices. This view is</p>
<p>confirmed when compared to related markets like the major stock</p>
<p>markets, the bund future and dollar/mark.</p>
