<p>Jim Colbert, the Senior Tour Player of the Year the last two seasons, was having surgery for prostate cancer on Monday, a spokeswoman for the golfer confirmed from the offices of Jim Colbert, Inc.</p>
<p>Colbert, who has withdrawn from the U.S. Senior Open scheduled for this weekend in Olympia Fields, Illinois, is undergoing the procedure at a California hospital, she said.</p>
<p>The 56-year-old Colbert won four Senior PGA Tour events in 1995 and five in 1996, but is winless so far this year. He competed last weekend in the Nationwide Championship at Alpharetta, Georgia, where he tied for 17th at two-under 214.</p>
<p>Colbert is eighth on the Senior PGA money list this year with $468,842.</p>
<p>Colbert becomes the second prominent Senior PGA member to undergo prostate surgery this year, joining Arnold Palmer.</p>
