<p>Illinois Treasurer Judy Baar Topinka said Standard &amp; Poor's Corp's assignment of a AAA grade to the state's investment pool Wednesday underscores the conservative nature of the pool's investments.</p>
<p>Topinka said the $2.4 billion government investment fund pursued the highest possible standards for safety and growth, while avoiding any internal politicization of the fund.</p>
<p>"We don't want an Orange County in Illinois," she said, referring to the California county's bankruptcy in late 1994.</p>
<p>Topinka said the S&amp;P rating should help attract even more local governments to the pool, which she predicted should hit $3 billion in investments by next July.</p>
<p>About 1,800 governments currently invest their funds in the pool -- representing about 20 percent of the total number of local taxing bodies in the state, she said.</p>
<p>Topinka added she plans to add an intermediate two- to three-year investment pool sometime next year. In addition, she will seek legislative approval for a long-term pool.</p>
<p>Also on the legislative front, Topinka said she will seek to gut two bills passed earlier this year by the Illinois General Assembly that she said allow certain municipalities and pension funds to use "volatile investments."</p>
<p>Illinois' pool is the 14th such pool to achieve S&amp;P's top-flight AAA, according to Peter Rizzo, an associate at the agency. Six other pools are rated AA, he said, adding that the Illinois pool is the fifth largest S&amp;P rates.</p>
<p>The agency cited the Illinois pool's "superior capacity to maintain principal and limit exposure to loss."</p>
