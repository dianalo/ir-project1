<p>Kuwait on Thursday dismissed as "lies" a Jordan newspaper report that Jordanian inmates in the Gulf state were recently beaten by security men.</p>
<p>"The Kuwaiti interior ministry denies allegations by Jordanian newspaper Ad-Dustour that Kuwaiti security men have beaten Jordanian prisoners," said a statement by Colonel Adel al-Ibrahim, the head of the ministry's public relations department.</p>
<p>Ad-Dustour said on Wednesday members of Kuwait's special forces were involved in attacks in the Central Prison where dozens of Jordanians and Palestinians serve long jail sentences for helping Iraq's troops during its 1990-91 occupation of Kuwait.</p>
<p>It said some of the inmates were hospitalised with serious injuries, but it did not disclose the source of the allegations.</p>
<p>The report "aims at defaming the state of Kuwait and attempts to illude the Jordanian public opinion so these baseless lies would be believed," Ibrahim said. "(Members of the) families of those prisoners...have visited them," he said.</p>
<p>The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said earlier this month 34 Jordanians jailed in Kuwait for helping the occupation troops received visits by relatives from Amman between January 6-8.</p>
<p>"The state of Kuwait is extremely keen on safeguarding human rights guaranteed by our Islamic religion," said Ibrahim noting that ICRC officials have unconditional access to Kuwaiti prisons.</p>
<p>Kuwait's ties with Jordan were strained over Amman's sympathy for Iraq during the seven-month occupation of the oil-rich Gulf Arab state.</p>
