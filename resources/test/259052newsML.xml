<headline>Tseng Labs sees losses, stock tumbles.</headline>
<dateline>NEWTOWN, Pa. 1996-12-16</dateline>

<p>Tseng Labs Inc., a maker of graphics accelerators and video products for personal computers, Monday warned of a significant loss in the fourth quarter, sparking a sharp selloff of its stock.</p>
<p>The stock lost $1.875, or about one-third of its value, to $4.125 on Nasdaq at midday.</p>
<p>Tseng, based in Newtown, Pa., said it expects to take a one-time charge of $11 million to $14 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The company said the losses are related to its decision to focus on its three-dimensional Graphics Roadmap product and phase out its two-dimensional graphics technology, which has a limited market.</p>
<p>Tseng said it expects losses beyond the fourth quarter until the company's new 3D graphics product achieves meaningful sales in the third quarter of 1997, at the earliest.</p>
