<p>Indian cotton was mixed on Wednesday with Punjab varieties rising while Gujarat was steady, dealers said.</p>
<p>Limited arrivals and shortage of ready stock led to some speculative buying which drove prices of Punjab varieties up but fresh mill buying was poor, they said.</p>
<p>In spot deals Punjab saw-ginned moved up by 25/30 rupees to 1,600/1,700 rupees per maund (37.32 kg) while F-414 rose to 1,900/1,925 rupees per maund from 1,885/1,905 rupees.</p>
<p>Bengal-deshi was 5 rupees higher at 885/935 rupees per maund.</p>
<p>Arrivals of cotton in the Punjab region dropped to 2,000/2,500 bales (170 kg each) from 4,000/5,000 bales on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gujarat cotton was steady in light trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>Gujarat Kalyan (medium-staple) was steady at 13,700/14,000 rupees per candy (355.56 kg).</p>
<p>The Bombay cotton market is closed on Thursday for a local holiday. It reopens on Friday.</p>
