<p>Indian investors this week will be watching Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, who is expected to unveil measures to shore up capital markets and revive sagging industrial growth, analysts and dealers said.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda is expected to announce policy initiatives before leaving on January 31 for the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>"We expect the PM will make a lot of policy and market-friendly announcements before leaving for Davos and during his stay there," broking firm Asit Mehta Investment Intermediates Ltd said in a market outlook.</p>
<p>The company believes speculative bidding in anticipation of "Davos-motivated announcements" could drive the 30-share Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) index up by 150 to 200 points.</p>
<p>After hitting a three-year low on December 4, the BSE index has soared 40 percent by mid-January.</p>
<p>Analysts attributed the rally to optimism inspired by a promise by Deve Gowda on December 31 to unveil market-boosting policy initiatives. Deve Gowda has since held confidence-boosting talks with stock exchange chiefs, industry captains and bankers on the subject.</p>
<p>But the rally has shown signs of tiring. The benchmark index ended last week down 13.27 points, or 0.39 percent, at 3,435.62.</p>
<p>"I expect the government to start unveiling some policy measures this week," said Ketan Jhaveri, chief dealer at brokerage Kotak Securities Ltd. "But, the major ones will have to wait until the budget."</p>
<p>Some of the possible measures are allowing companies to buy back their shares to reduce equity overhang and scrapping taxes on shareholders' dividends, analysts said.</p>
<p>The government may also raise the ceiling on foreign institutional holdings in State Bank of India, the country's largest commercial bank, to 24 percent from 20 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The outlook of the government has changed," said Jhaveri. "I'm bullish -- there's a positive feeling all around."</p>
<p>But Jatin Khandwala, a partner in brokerage Jayantilal Khandwala and Sons, warned of excessive optimism.</p>
<p>"Expectations are so high," he said. "We run the risk of a setback."</p>
<p>He expects the BSE index to stay in the 3,300-3,550 range in the run-up to the annual budget on February 28.</p>
<p>Khandwala Securities, another brokerage, was also sceptical.</p>
<p>"We see no major movements ... unless the promises made by the government on capital market reforms fructify," it said.</p>
<p>Rupen Jain, a dealer at broking firm Mahendra Ratanshi Shah &amp; Bros said he sees the index rising about 100 points this week.</p>
<p>Carry-forward charges on Saturday averaged 24 percent a year against 40 percent a week ago and could act as a springboard to fuel another upsurge, he said.</p>
<p>Kotak's Jhaveri said foreign funds were now buying into quality stocks across the board as Indian shares are still seen as bargains compared to other emerging markets despite recent share-price gains.</p>
<p>"There's been a lot of FII (foreign institutional investor) orders but not all are being executed because there are no sellers," he said.</p>
