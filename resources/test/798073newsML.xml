<p>The Chinese yuan closed lower at 8.2896 against the U.S. dollar on Wednesday on a technical correction after hitting a 27-month high close of 8.2885 on Tuesday, traders said.</p>
<p>The correction had been expected because the yuan's rise to its 27-month high on Tuesday was based on speculative buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The yuan's rise on Tuesday was due to a few speculative deals and was not solid," one trader said.</p>
<p>"It did not reflect a change in market fundamentals and a technical correction today was expected," he said.  </p>
<p>Trading was less active on Wednesday compared with Tuesday with most business done at 8.2896, traders said.</p>
<p>Dealers said pro-yuan sentiment was strong despite the fall on Wednesday with bankers expecting strong foreign trade data for July to be announced by Beijing in mid-August.</p>
<p>"Expectations of a large trade suplus will continue to support the yuan at its high levels," a second dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the yuan to move just above the 8.2900 level on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The yuan opened sharply lower at an intraday low of 8.2951 and rose quickly to move in a narrow range of 8.2895 and 8.2899 for most of the session, hitting a high of 8.2889.</p>
<p>The weighted average price on Tuesday was 8.2891.</p>
<p>The yuan closed up at 7.1000 from 7.1310 against 100 Japanese yen and lower at an intraday low of 1.0720 from 1.0697 against the Hong Kong dollar.</p>
