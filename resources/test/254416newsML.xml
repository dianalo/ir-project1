<p>Twelve drummers drumming arrived this week on the doorstep of an elderly Canadian couple, capping a 12-year saga in which they received the gifts of "The 12 Days of Christmas" from distant locales.</p>
<p>The tale began in 1985 when Mary and Stanley Grandish of Edmonton, Alberta, discovered a stuffed partridge in their backyard pear tree.</p>
<p>"We thought that was the end of it and then the second year it kept on and on and we got parcels from Australia, from Germany, from Switzerland, from Ontario and Alberta, all different places," said Mary Grandish, 80.</p>
<p>The anonymous gifts, which came in the order outlined in the traditional verse and song, included six white satin geese mailed from Germany, seven silver napkin holders shaped like swans from Australia and eight tiny maids, all a-milking stuffed felt cows from Wildwood, Alberta.</p>
<p>Each gift arrived from a different city, with no return address and few clues about the sender.</p>
<p>The 12 wax-and-plastic drummer-angels received this year came in a package postmarked New Orleans and were accompanied by a poem reading "Ho Ho Ho ... it's a secret."</p>
<p>Mary Grandish said she and her 81-year-old husband had believed the identity of their secret Santa would be revealed this year with the final gift, but they were left stymied.</p>
<p>"We've just been wondering and wondering and waiting," she said. "We've suspected everyone we know."</p>
<p>The Grandishes said the partridge in a pear tree was made of stuffed fabric and came from the western Canadian province of Alberta.</p>
<p>The two acrylic turtle doves were also sent from Alberta. The three stuffed satin hens were sent from Nice, France. The four stuffed fabric calling birds came from Canada, while the five golden rings were sausage rings wrapped in gold paper and sent from Alberta.</p>
<p>The nine ladies dancing were plastic figurines from Henrietta, New York. The 10 lords-a-leaping were painted wooden toys from Waterloo, Ontario and the 11 pipers piping were statuettes from Switzerland.</p>
<p>The author of the Twelve Days of Christmas poem is unknown. There is speculation it was written by 16th-century British Jesuits trying to preserve the Catholic faith amid state persecution. Some Catholics believe that each gift is a religious symbol.</p>
