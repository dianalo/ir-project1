<p>Nasdaq closed higher in a mixed session Tuesday, as over-the-counter stocks followed the steady recovery in the Dow industrials and the bond market, traders said.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index gained 8.79 points or 0.56 percent to close unofficially at 1572.32. The session was mixed, however, with decliners beating gainers 2210 to 2108 on total volume of 638 million shares. Nasdaq shares have showed gains in six of the past 10 sessions.</p>
<p>"The over-the-counter futures were lower this morning, and things opened soft. But gradually, the pace picked up and things just improved slowly as the day wore on," said Jack Bayer, managing director of Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Ascend Communications Inc, the most active Nasdaq issue, set the pace for a rally in networking stocks, while semiconductor stocks showed mild losses. Ascend gained 6-3/8 to 53-1/8, while Intel Corp dropped 7/16 to 88-1/8.</p>
<p>Cyrix Corp jumped 1-14/16 to 24-15/16 after it agreed to be acquired by National Semiconductor Corp.</p>
<p>Nordstrom Inc jumped 3-5/8 to 56-5/8 after Rodman &amp; Renshaw raised sales and earnings estimates based on strong early sales trends during the retailers anniversary sale.</p>
