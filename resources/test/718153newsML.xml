<p>Germany must cut social security payments if it is to overcome the current high level of unemployment, said Dieter Hundt, president of the Federation of German Employers' Associations (BDA), said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Hundt said parliamentary mediation on Finance Minister Theo Waigel's tax reform bills, due to start on Thursday, should also focus on the need for structural change to combat joblessness.</p>
<p>Tax reform must be passed as quickly as possible in its original form, he said. If companies can no longer write off start-up losses, it is no wonder that foreign investors give Germany a wide berth, he said.</p>
<p>"It is intolerable that a traffic jam in political reform is lying on us like mildew," Hundt said in an interview with the Berlin newspaper B.Z.</p>
<p>"What we need is not a refinancing, but a reduction in social security payouts. Pension levels must be adapted to population developments starting next year," Hundt said.</p>
<p>Waigel's tax reform was passed by the lower house of parliament but defeated in the upper house, and goes to the mediation committee on Thursday, where an uncertain future awaits it.</p>
<p>Business groups have already attacked the coalition's modifications of the plan, saying they would have a negative impact on investment and jobs.</p>
<p>One of the changes, restricting the way companies can carry forward losses from previous years to offset tax liability in profitable years, would hit cyclical industries and start-up ventures.</p>
