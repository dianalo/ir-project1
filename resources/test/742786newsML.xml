<p>Israeli bonds closed higher on Monday on uncertainty about future inflation levels and interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: +0.08 pct to 110.13</p>
<p>* CPI-linked government bonds: +0.11 pct to 110.15</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds: +0.12 pct to 109.86</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: -0.33 pct to 110.61</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.04 pct to 107.98</p>
<p>Volume including Makams was a low 141 million shekels.</p>
<p>"There is uncertainty in the market about inflation and interest rates," said Ofer Agassi of the Financial Immunities consulting firm.</p>
<p>"The yield curve of the CPI-linked bonds is once again a classical curve -- rising from left to right -- after sloping from left to right for a number of months. This indicates that investors want a premium for long-term investments because of the uncertainty about interest rates," Agassi said.</p>
<p>The June CPI released last Tuesday rose 1.1 percent, well above expectations, and has heightened fears of an interest rate hike later this month.</p>
<p>The Bank of Israel slashed its base lending rate in mid-June by 1.2 percentage points to an annualised 12.7 percent. The central bank will announce its monthly monetary programme for August on July 28.</p>
<p>The high index caused prices of CPI-linked bonds to rise and unlinked bonds to fall last week. But on Sunday unlinked bonds reversed course and prices were higher on Monday as well.</p>
<p>"The weakening of the dollar against the shekel has raised hopes that the next CPI won't be so high because the dollar will have less impact on inflation," said Ronen Elgali of United Mizrahi Bank.</p>
<p>The shekel rose against the dollar on Monday for the fourth consecutive session. The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.5240 shekels compared with 3.5320 on Friday.</p>
<p>Dollar-linked bonds fell on Monday on the weakening of the dollar against the shekel, Agassi said.</p>
<p>"Prices of CPI-linked bonds rose because of the shortage effect," said Dany Shamir of Israel Discount Bank. "Redemptions are bigger than new issues causing a shortage of CPI-linked bonds."</p>
<p>There was big demand for the central bank's issue of 350 million shekels in CPI-linked bonds on Monday, Shamir said.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
