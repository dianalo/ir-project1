<p>Turkey's largely state-owned petroleum refiner Tupras Turkiye Petrol Rafinerileri A.S. reached a record 88 percent capacity usage this year, its general manager, Ergun Kuran, said on Monday.</p>
<p>"Consumption of petroleum products in Turkey rise about seven percent each year. As a result, Tupras has raised its capacity usage rate to 88 percent to meet domestic demand," Kuran said in a statement faxed to Reuters.</p>
<p>"This is the highest rate we have reached until now and is at the same level as refineries in the European Union," he said.</p>
<p>Tupras which celebrated its 13th anniversary on Monday, planned to refine a record high of more than 23 million tonnes of crude oil this year and produce more than 22 million tonnes of petroleum products, Ergun said.</p>
<p>The company refined 23 million tonnes of crude oil in 1995.</p>
<p>"Despite record high (refining and production) figures, our (four) refineries cannot fully meet domestic demand. We resort to imports to meet excess demand in all products ranging from LPG (liquid petroleum gas) to fuel oil," Ergun said.</p>
<p>He added that imports of petroleum products have exceeded four million tonnes so far this year, up sharply from 2.8 million tonnes in the whole of 1995.</p>
<p>Ergun said about half of the company's $2 billion investment target would be realised in coming days when a hydrocracker and CCR unit at northwestern Izmit refinery will start operating.</p>
<p>He said the Izmit hydrocracker project which cost $377 million would be finished 2-1/2 months ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Tupras is included in the government's privatisation programme.</p>
