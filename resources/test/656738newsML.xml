<p>Minneapolis Public Schools officials have produced a five-year $247 million capital building plan to address increasing enrollments, Facilities Director Don Haydon said Thursday.</p>
<p>The proposed plan backed Tuesday night by the board of education would include seven new school buildings, maintenance of existing facilities and smaller projects through the year 2002, Haydon said.</p>
<p>Board members also gave district officials authority to ask the state board of education to allow planning and construction for three buildings in the first phase of the project, Haydon said.</p>
<p>Each phase of the plan will need state approval and school officials will evaluate the financial feasibility of meeting those goals each year, Finance Director Chuck Irrgang said.</p>
<p>Irrgang said the district is considering a sale of $50 million of certificates of participation to finance the first phase.</p>
<p>That sale could take place "at the earliest" in the fall under the district's plan to maintain a reasonable level of indebtedness while meeting its capital needs, Irrgang said.</p>
<p>Evensen Dodge Inc. has been selected as financial adviser for the sale and Dorsey &amp; Whitney LLP of Minneapolis as bond counsel, Irrgang said. The district has insured past issuances and is considering that possibility as well, he added.</p>
<p>The district will have a total of $272 million of outstanding debt when fiscal 1997 ends June 30, including $248 million of taxpayer-funded debt, Irrgang said.</p>
<p>The district plans to issue $61 million of general obligation debt in July, which includes $50 million for the last issuance in an existing capital program, Irrgang said.</p>
<p>Haydon said the district would like to open two new schools in fall 1999 and a third the following year. The overall plan projects a need for four elementary schools, two middle schools and a high school, he said.</p>
<p>Construction of all seven schools would cost about $150 million, maintenance on existing buildings is projected to cost another $75 million and the remaining $22 million would fund smaller projects, Haydon said.</p>
