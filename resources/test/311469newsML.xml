<p>A Polish court sentenced four volunteer firemen to jail on Thursday for setting more than 30 fires so they could win glory and rewards for putting them out.</p>
<p>The arson against homes, farms and forests spread panic in the southeast Poland village of Cmielow from 1993-95, forcing residents to stay up all night guarding their property.</p>
<p>The provincial court in Tarnobrzeg sentenced two men, including the ringleader -- the son of the local fire chief -- to four years in jail and gave the other two shorter suspended terms, court spokesman Jozef Dyl told PAP news agency.</p>
