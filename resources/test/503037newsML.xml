<p>U.S. food companies are expected to report a mixed bag of quarterly earnings, with some results hurt by tough comparisons and higher costs while others benefit from strength in key divisions.</p>
<p>Kellogg Co, feeling the continued effects of cereal price cuts, is expected to report first quarter earnings that are about 20 percent below year-ago results.</p>
<p>"Clearly, the problems there are declining domestic cereal volume and lower prices," Goldman Sachs analyst Nomi Ghez said.  </p>
<p>Meat processor IBP Inc, under pressure from comparatively poor beef and pork margins, will report first quarter earnings that are about 29 percent below a year ago, analysts said.</p>
<p>CPC International Inc, hurt by its corn refining business, is expected to show overall first quarter results that are flat to slightly higher than a year ago.</p>
<p>CPC's food profits alone should continue the solid growth rates of 1996, benefiting from gains in the United States and Europe, BT Securities analyst John O'Neil said in a report. CPC plans to spin off its corn refining business.  </p>
<p>Quaker Oats Co, not counting its Snapple beverage business that it plans to sell, has said it expects earnings for the first quarter will at least match last year's results. Quaker said its results will be helped by strength in cereals and gains in its U.S. Gatorade sports drink.</p>
<p>Sara Lee Corp will be among the firms showing the strongest earnings gains, with third quarter results seen about 14 percent higher than a year ago. "Their volume trends this quarter seem to be reasonably good," CS First Boston analyst Michael Mauboussin said. "Strong cash flows should help their financing costs."  </p>
<p>Ralcorp Holdings Co, after shedding its branded cereal and snack business, will show a profit for its fiscal second quarter, BT Securities' O'Neil said. No comparable, pro forma, year-ago quarterly results are available.</p>
<p>O'Neil said he believes Ralcorp will show a slight loss from its food operations, which will be offset by equity income from its ski resort holdings.</p>
