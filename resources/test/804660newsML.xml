<p>Palestinian shares continued to slump on Sunday in thin trading as West Bank and Gaza firms felt the bite of nearly three weeks of an Israeli security closure, the Palestinian Securities Exchange (PSE) said.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem Index dropped 0.33 percent to 104.32 on turnover of over 60,767 shares valued at 99,166 Jordanian dinars, compared to Wednesday's 31,290 shares worth 53,090 dinars.</p>
<p>The exchange holds two sessions a week.</p>
<p>Shares in only seven of of the bourse's 16 listed companies changed hands on Sunday. Five closed lower and two ended the day unchanged.</p>
<p>"It's a dead market," PSE General Manager Safwan Bataina told Reuters. "Volume is up a bit but its still below the pre-closure levels."</p>
<p>"Companies are suffering from the closure. They are having difficulties with workers coming to plants, importing raw materials and exporting," Bataina said.</p>
<p>Israel sealed off the West Bank and Gaza after two suicide bombers killed 14 people in a Jewish market on July 30. Israel says it will ease its siege when the Palestinian Authority cracks down on militants.</p>
<p>Shares in the Palestine Telecommunications Co (PALTEL), the largest firm on the exchange, closed unchanged at 1.55 dinars. Gaza Ahliea Insurance Co tumbled 1.79 percent to $1.10 per share and National Insurance Co fell 1.02 percent to 1.95 dinars.</p>
<p>Trading is conducted in dollars or dinars in the absence of a Palestinian currency. The exchange first began publishing an index on July 13.</p>
<p>($1 = 0.709 dinars)</p>
