<p>Iraq urged the United Nations on Sunday to implement their oil-for-food deal as soon as possible, while Iraqis in the streets of Baghdad cursed U.S. President Bill Clinton for trying to delay the programme.</p>
<p>Saadoun Hammadi, speaker of Iraq's parliament, the National Assembly, gave reporters a copy of a letter he sent to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali urging him "to quickly implement the oil-for-food formula...to alleviate the suffering of more than 20 million Iraqis."</p>
<p>The official al-Qadissiya newspaper said Clinton's attempt to put off the deal proved that the United States was lying when it repeatedly said in the past that it was concerned for the suffering of Iraqi people.</p>
<p>Iraq is barred under sanctions imposed for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait from exporting oil. But under a separate deal with the United Nations it was to buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies worth about $1.13 billion out of $2 billion of limited oil exports over six months.</p>
<p>But after Iraqi forces attacked Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq on August 31, U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali delayed implementing the deal last week for the safety of U.N. staff monitoring the flow of oil and distribution of supplies.</p>
<p>His decision boosted oil prices on world markets which had expected Iraqi oil to start flowing within weeks.</p>
<p>Clinton also said he wanted the plan put off.</p>
<p>"Until we are sure that these humanitarian supplies can get actually get to those who need them, the plan cannot go forward," Clinton said last Tuesday, noting that the fallen Kurdish city of Arbil was a key distribution point.</p>
<p>"It's going to be some time before we can get back to any consideration of that programme," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.</p>
<p>But the European Union, Russia and some Arab countries have said they want the oil-for-food programme to go ahead.</p>
<p>Iraqi officials and the government-controlled press have been more furious at Washington for suspending the oil deal than for the 44 cruise missiles it fired on air defence targets on southern Iraq last week.</p>
<p>Iraq's Information Minister Abd-al-Ghani Abd-al-Ghafur issued a statement lambasting Clinton over the oil issue.</p>
<p>Traders and shoppers in Baghdad's Shourja seethed with anger.</p>
<p>"They wanted to help the Iraqi people and not the government. And see what happened," said a trader.</p>
<p>The U.S. decision has sent the volatile dinar on a roller- coaster ride again. Prices climb and tumble by the hour and shoppers have almost nothing to curse but the "wretched Clinton".</p>
<p>The dinar slid to about 1,750 to the dollar mid last week from about 1,000 prior to the U.S. decision to postpone the deal. Recently, it has been hovering between 1,200 to 1,500.</p>
<p>"That (the delay in implementing the deal) was the easiest thing for Clinton to do. Our Saddam defied him in Arbil and foiled his CIA. Clinton retaliates by suspending our rations," said a woman shopper.</p>
<p>Several traders said it was difficult for them to work under such circumstances. "You never know whether you are a winner or loser. Our market situation now defies logic," said one.</p>
<p>To allay fears of traders, state television interrupted its programmes on Saturday to announce that traffic on the highway to Turkey was in full swing and the trade ministry intended to ship huge quantities of foodstuffs to markets in coming days.</p>
<p>The same day state television again interrupted a programme to convey the news that European Union foreign ministers meeting in Ireland had called for the oil-for-food deal to go ahead.</p>
<p>Britain's Deputy Ambassador Stephen Gomersall said on Friday that Boutros-Ghali would decide when conditions were ripe for implementing the oil-for-food deal.</p>
<p>But Gomersall said the events this week would make it difficult for "Boutros-Ghali to go ahead."</p>
<p>Italy asked for the deal to receive further consideration in the Security Council to make sure "it is kept in play," said the current council president, Alfredo Lopes Cabral of Guinea-Bissau.</p>
