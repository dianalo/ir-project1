<p>Air France will be increasing its cargo capacity to Asian markets in a couple of months when it will have an additional 747-200 freighter, Air France cargo general in the UK Anne Veyssie told Reuters.</p>
<p>"Air France is focusing on increasing its business to Asia," she added.</p>
<p>The additional aircraft - a conversion of an Air France 747-200 combi - should be in service by the beginning of April bringing its 747-200 freighter fleet to 12.</p>
<p>This will enable Air France to increase capacity on Air France's routes to Bangkok, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taipei in its summer schedule.</p>
<p>The current fuel surcharge is only covering part of the additional costs caused by the steep rise in fuel costs since last summer, Veyssie stated.</p>
<p>On December 20 Air France Cargo in Paris said it planned to increase freight rates effective mid-February but has yet to detail the rises.</p>
