<p>Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat crossed into Jordan on Monday from the West Bank to brief King Hussein on the latest impasse in Israeli-Palestinian talks since a recent flare-up in violence.</p>
<p>Arafat was due to meet the king in the Raghdan Palace in Amman, Jordanian officials said.</p>
<p>Israel and the Palestinians have fallen out over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's delay in implementing a redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>"We are here to meet King Hussein to discuss our concerns about the lack of implementing the accords, which we all signed," Arafat told reporters at the Allenby Bridge.</p>
<p>PLO officials said Arafat had rejected a proposal by Netanyahu that they could hold a summit on Monday if Arafat agreed to change the Hebron deal signed a year ago by Israel's previous government and give Israel powers in areas that were to be given to the PLO.</p>
