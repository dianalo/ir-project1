<p>Germany said on Friday it hoped Turkey would adopt a softer tone after prosecutors indicated that a fire that killed a Turkish woman and two children was not the result of a racist attack.</p>
<p>German police have detained the father of the Turkish family on suspicion of starting the fire in which his wife and two children died and which has strained relations with Turkey, a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>State prosecutors in the town of Krefeld said 42-year-old Azir Demir was strongly suspected of starting the fire on Sunday night.</p>
<p>Turkey's Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan angered Germany by blaming the attack, together with a suspected racist firebombing in the Netherlands in which six Turks died, on rising anti-Moslem sentiment in the West.</p>
<p>"It looks like it wasn't a racist attack. I just hope that we can get moderation and restraint from Turkey that we haven't had up to now," government spokesman Herbert Schmuelling told a news conference.</p>
<p>Erbakan's comments had fuelled a war of words between Turkey and Germany, which is particularly sensitive to such accusations after working hard to combat racism following an upsurge of anti-foreigner attacks after unification in 1990.</p>
<p>More than 30 people died then, among them five Turkish women and children in a single attack in Solingen in 1993.</p>
<p>On Thursday the Bonn foreign ministry called in the Turkish ambassador to register its annoyance.</p>
<p>But shortly afterwards Turkey's Interior Minister Meral Aksener was quoted by the semi-official Anatolian news agency as saying that "they (Germans) couldn't throw us out, now they are trying to burn us out", prompting a sharp response from her German counterpart, Manfred Kanther.</p>
<p>Police said all along that there was no evidence to suggest that the fire in Krefeld had been caused by a racially motivated attack.</p>
<p>The man's 41-year-old wife was fatally injured when she jumped from their third-floor flat in a high-rise block in the town centre. A 16-year-old daughter died in hospital from injuries and a 17-year-old son was found dead in the building.</p>
<p>Two female members of the family, aged 19 and 16, also jumped from the flat and were severely injured.</p>
<p>Some German commentators have attributed Turkey's response to its fears, stoked by comments by European conservatives at a recent congress, that it is being shut out of European integration because it does not have a Christian culture.</p>
<p>A leading Bonn parliamentarian, Christian Democrat parliamentary business manager Joachim Hoerster, said that what he called "unbelievable gaffes" by Turkish officials would make it harder for Turkey to join the European Union.</p>
<p>"Mr Erbakan must realise that Europe is bigger than eastern Anatolia," he said.</p>
