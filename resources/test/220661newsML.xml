<p>Pressure mounted on the Canadian government on Wednesday to rescue Canadian Airlines Corp. as a deadline loomed for the ailing carrier to conclude a rescue plan.</p>
<p>Two of its biggest unions remained defiant in their opposition to company and government demands for wage concessions. Opposition from the Canadian Auto Workers and Canadian Union of Public Employees has blocked a survival plan agreed to by four other unions and the company.</p>
<p>That plan would involve average wage cuts of about 5 percent and C$35 million ($26 million) in assistance from Ottawa and the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia.</p>
<p>Canadian would save C$70 million ($53 million) under the scheme. With the government and wage concessions, major route restructurings and a C$48 million ($36 million) cut in fees paid to AMR Corp., parent of American Airlines, the carrier aims to add C$180 million ($135 million) per year to its bottom line over four years.</p>
<p>Alberta Premier Ralph Klein agreed to tax and loan repayment concessions on Tuesday, on the condition that Canada and British Columbia also offer the airline savings.</p>
<p>Canadian has set a deadline of midnight Pacific time Wednesday 0800 GMT Thursday for reaching an agreement with all parties.</p>
<p>Canadian Airlines President Kevin Benson told reporters that the deadline was firm and his focus on Wednesday would be convincing the two holdout unions and federal government to agree to the restructuring.</p>
<p>"We have the best plan we can get. It's right here ... waiting and ready to happen," he said.</p>
<p>The public employees union and CAW, which together represent 6,300 of Canadian's 16,400 workers, have so far rejected any wage concessions.</p>
<p>They are calling for the federal government to bail out the airline and re-regulate Canada's domestic airline industry.</p>
<p>Canadian Transport Minister David Anderson has been in Vancouver all week in a bid to resolve the crisis, but he has refused to commit to any assistance until all the airline's unions agreed to wage cuts.</p>
<p>"We need you to say you will put money into this airline and show some leadership," public employees union President Judy Darcy urged Ottawa in a speech to a labour convention in Vancouver on Wednesday. Added CAW President Buzz Hargrove, "The government has to step in."</p>
<p>They said creditors, including major lender Royal Bank of Canada and Fort Worth, Tex.-based AMR, a one-third owner of Canadian, must make sacrifices.</p>
<p>The International Association of Machinists, which has agreed to the restructuring plan, said swift help from Ottawa was vital to get the rescue operation off the ground. "One of the main players still has not come to the plate -- the federal government," said Machinists President Dave Ritchie.</p>
<p>British Columbia Premier Glen Clark has expressed willingness to help.  Clark was in Dallas on Wednesday to meet with AMR officials, union officials said.</p>
