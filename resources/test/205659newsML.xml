<p>El Paso Electric Co said Thursday it was unable to reach agreement with Salt River Project (SRP) on transmission access into Mexico.</p>
<p>SRP, a public utility based in Phoenix, Ariz., was the low bidder in a recent tender by Mexico national utility Comision Federal de Electricidad (CFE) to supply northern Mexico with 200 megawatts during calendar 1997.</p>
<p>But the power must be brought in on transmission lines owned and operated by El Paso, which currently supplies the power to CFE.</p>
<p>El Paso has said it does not have enough excess transmission capacity to accomodate the SRP request, and said Thursday SRP failed to take into account all of the costs associated with ancillary services needed for its bid to CFE.</p>
<p>In a statement, El Paso said the southern transmission system in New Mexico, which is the primary path of delivering capacity from SRP to CFE, is fully loaded.</p>
<p>"SRP has concluded that it does not wish to pay all of the costs required by FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission) Order No. 888 and necessary to provide the requested transmission capacity to serve CFE," El Paso said.</p>
<p>Officials at SRP could not be immediately reached for comment, but said earlier this week the public utility would pursue an open access filing through FERC if an agreement could not be reached with El Paso.</p>
