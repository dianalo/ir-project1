<p>U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher began his first Africa tour on Monday, seeking support for sanctions against Nigeria and the replacement of U.N. chief Boutros Boutros-Ghali.</p>
<p>"I think we'll be starting a round of consulations with Commonwealth countries and our European allies to see if we can find support for taking further action (against Nigeria)," Christopher told reporters on his plane before landing in Mali.</p>
<p>Citing human rights abuses and corruption, Christopher said Washington "continues to be very troubled by our relationship with Nigeria...as much because of the tremendous potential Nigeria has and the failed promise of Nigeria".</p>
<p>The United States followed its European allies in imposing token sanctions against Nigeria, which angered the international community last November by hanging nine minority activists convicted of murder by a special tribunal.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth group of Britain and its former colonies suspended Nigeria's membership. But, like the United States, it stopped short of an embargo on Nigeria's oil which human rights campaigners say would be the most effective sanction.</p>
<p>It was not clear what measures Christopher had in mind. A senior U.S. official said the first step would be to assess the views of Washington's European partners.</p>
<p>Christopher said Nigeria was among the topics to be discussed with leaders in Mali, Ethiopia, Tanzania, South Africa and Angola. His talks with heads of state there would be followed by consultations with European allies and other African states, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>Christopher also said he would try to rally Africans behind the United States in its determination to deny Boutros-Ghali a second term as U.N. Secretary General.</p>
<p>"Everywhere I go, I'm going to be talking about the importance of Africa coming forward with good candidates for the U.N. secretary generalship," he told reporters aboard his U.S. Air Force jet enroute to Mali.</p>
<p>Insisting U.S. views on this issue are firm, he said "it's time for Africa to come forward with some strong candidates."</p>
<p>"We think African candidates deserve special consideration (in the selection process) but unless some are offered up we're going to be left without some to consider," he said.</p>
<p>The United States announced several months ago it would veto Boutros-Ghali if his name was submitted for reappointment to the U.N. Security Council for a second five-year term. His current tenure runs out at the end December.</p>
<p>But most governments have not engaged seriously on the issue, apparently believing Washington would reverse itself after the U.S. presidential election on November 5.</p>
<p>The administration insists Boutros-Ghali must be replaced with a more reform-minded secretary general who will retool the world body to meet the challenges of the 21st century.</p>
<p>Christopher is the first secretary of state to visit sub-Saharan Africa for more than six years. He began the tour in Mali as a tribute to the country's smooth transition to democracy after years of one-party dictatorship.</p>
<p>Arriving in the capital Bamako from Israel, Christopher said Mali "faced some of the toughest economic and environmental challenges of any nation on earth".</p>
<p>But by instituting political and economic reforms since 1991, "you have shown these challenges can be met as long as nations chose democracy and free markets," he said in an airport statement after being met by Mali's foreign minister Dioncounda Traore and other senior officials.</p>
<p>"I'm inspired with what the people of Mali have done. You've shown all of Africa and all the world that freedom can unlock the door to a better future," Christopher added.</p>
