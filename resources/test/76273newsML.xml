<headline>London gold and silver ease slightly in PM.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-25</dateline>

<p>Gold and silver prices eased gently on Wednesday afternoon following a brisk shortcovering rally earlier in the day, dealers said.</p>
<p>The platinum group metals, however, held on to gains made over the past couple of days on shortcovering.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed at $382.40 an ounce, compared to $383.25 in the morning and $382.30 on Thursday afternoon. Bids were quoted so far between $383.80 and $381.90.</p>
<p>Comex gold was down $0.30 at $385.40 an ounce.</p>
<p>"There was some good shortcovering this morning and then probably some profit taking," a dealer said.  </p>
<p>The price movements were sparked by fresh comments regarding the International Monetary Fund's proposal to sell some gold reserves to pay for aid to poor countries, dealers said.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was reported saying in a newspaper interview that the IMF would "ultimately" sell some gold. But Germany's finance state secretary Juergen Stark said in another interview that Germany remained opposed to the sales.</p>
<p>"The IMF had it bouncing around a bit," a dealer said.</p>
<p>Gold prices were unlikely, however, to stray far from the centre of the $380-$385 price band ahead of the over-the-counter options expiry on Thursday afternoon, dealers said.  </p>
<p>A mild boost from the Fed's Tuesday decision not to increase interest rates was effectively erased by Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>A rate hike would have raised the cost of holding gold, making it less appealing to investors.</p>
<p>Silver was indicated at $4.91/$4.93, up three cents from Tuesday's London close. It was considered more vulnerable to a sell-off than gold after last week's tumble below $5.00.</p>
<p>But until the market saw a major move, it was stuck in a $4.88-$4.94 range, analysts said.</p>
<p>Shortcovering gave a sizable corrective boost to palladium, which was indicated up $2.00 at $119.00/$120.00.  </p>
<p>But as long as it remained below the key $120 area it remained susceptible to further sell-offs which pushed it to three-year lows last week, dealers said.</p>
<p>Platinum was also perkier at $387.50/$388.50, up $1.40 from Tuesday's London close.</p>
<p>But analysts said it was likely to remain stuck in a $385-$390 range in the absence of technical and fundamental factors.</p>
