<p>COMMENT - Trading was quiet on both sides of Christmas, except for some early carryover from last week's strong finish in Southern Pine, Random Lengths said in its weekly review. Convinced that buyers will replenish soon after Jan 1, mills were inclined to hold prices and fall back on small order files.  </p>
<p>A few items finished higher, with most of the increases clustered in Southern Pine, the reporting agency said.</p>
<p>Year-end sawmill shutdowns temporarily relieved selling pressure for some producers in all regions. Boxing Day kept most traders in Canada out of their offices on Thursday.</p>
<p>Secondaries concentrated on keeping inventories light while scouring the landscape for back-to-back orders to fill, Random Lengths said.</p>
<p>Winter hit the northern half of the country hard, while rain pounded the Pacific Coast and parts of the South, it said.  </p>
<p>As of Dec 17, Canadian lumber imports totalled 73.4 percent of Oct/Dec quota and 77.8 pct of annual April/March quota.</p>
<p>Trading in Western S-P-F was limited as most producers reduced pressure to sell last week. Quota talk was rare since B.C. mill shipments were well-short of fee-free limits. Std&amp;Btr held in the low $390's; some mills quoted as high as $410.</p>
<p>Eastern S-P-F markets sputtered. Some secondaries offered discounts on stock they owned, but these generated few sales.</p>
<p>Southern Pine was supported by last week's strong finish. The 2x6 was the most active item in #2, but #1 2x6 was still occasionally discounted in the central and eastside zones.</p>
