<p>Japanese telephone operator DDI Corp's half-year earnings swung into the red as a larger-than-expected increase in cellular phone users pushed up operating costs, the company said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Robust expansion of Japan's cellular phone market continued during the April to September period with the help of price cuts. In all, 5.1 million new subscribers joined during the six months, boosting the number of users by 44.4 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>But commission expenses and ever-bigger investments for the construction of base stations and other facilities to serve the growing ranks of subscribers hurt operators.</p>
<p>DDI posted a group net loss of 20.60 billion yen ($185 million) during the six months to September 30, a turnaround from a 12.28 billion yen ($110 million) profit a year earlier.</p>
<p>DDI had originally planned to acquire about one million new subscribers for its cellular phone service in the business year to March 1997, but the target was achieved in nearly six months, the company said.</p>
<p>An operating loss in personal handy phones (PHS) -- a system of a simplified, cheaper type of cellular phones which DDI started in July 1995 -- was also larger than DDI's original estimate due to larger commission fees, DDI said.</p>
<p>DDI suffered a net loss of 41 billion yen ($369 million) in the PHS business during the six months.</p>
<p>On the other hand, sales of cellular phone handsets and parts used in construction of base stations more than doubled to 83.09 billion yen ($748 million) thanks to the cellular phone boom, the company said.</p>
<p>DDI forecast a group net loss of 35 billion yen ($315 million) for the year to March 31, 1997 against a net profit of 4.28 billion yen ($38.5 million) a year earlier. ($1=111 yen)</p>
