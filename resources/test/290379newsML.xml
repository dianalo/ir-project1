<p>Australia fast bowler Andrew Bichel tore through the top order as Pakistan staggered to a meagre 149 all out in their limited overs World Series match on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The tourists were dominated throughout by an Australian pace attack that exploited a lively pitch to dismiss their opponents in 45.2 overs of their 50-over quota at Bellerive Oval.</p>
<p>Bichel, playing in only his second one-day international, set the tone with his first ball when he trapped opener Zahoor Elahi leg before wicket for a duck.</p>
<p>Fellow opener Aamir Sohail and number three Ijaz Ahmed were also dismissed without scoring as Pakistan slumped to a dismal seven for three in the fourth over.</p>
<p>Despite a battling half-century from Mohammad Wasim, Pakistan were unable to recover their poise or momentum after those early setbacks.</p>
<p>Wasim, batting at number five, scored 54 to save his side from an abject surrender before his became the sixth wicket to fall with the total on 116.</p>
<p>Wasim, the only batsman to look at all comfortable, eventually fell when he edged a delivery from leg-spinner Shane Warne to Australia captain Mark Taylor at first slip.</p>
<p>But it was Australia's pace bowlers who proved almost unplayable at times as they extracted bounce and movement from a damp pitch.</p>
<p>Pakistan's early troubles raised questions over captain Wasim Akram's judgement after he won the toss and elected to bat in overcast conditions.</p>
<p>Bichel finished with economical figures of three for 17 from his ten overs after adding number three Ijaz and middle order batsman Mujahid Jamshed to his list of victims.</p>
