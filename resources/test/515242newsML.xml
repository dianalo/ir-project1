<p>Many players in the Japanese bond underwriting business have shied away from scandal-ridden Nomura Securities Co Ltd, but it remains a powerhouse in the international underwriting arena.</p>
<p>The scandal linking some Nomura directors to racketeers has forced Nomura out of much of the domestic underwriting business, a serious blow to the prestige of Japan's largest financial group.</p>
<p>But in the international fields of Eurobonds and samurais, Nomura continues to be a main player.</p>
<p>"Nomura's reputation in the samurai and Eurobond markets remains high. The situation is quite different from the domestic straight bond market," a senior underwriting source at a major Japanese brokerage said.</p>
<p>A bond underwriter acts as the middleman between issuer and investor, setting the price for the issue and ensuring that buyers will be found.</p>
<p>"Overseas issuers follow the basic market principle...they simply choose brokerages which offer the best terms."</p>
<p>Nomura has been under a cloud since it disclosed on March 6 that two of its managing directors funnelled money to a client linked to "sokaiya" racketeers, who extort money from companies by threatening to disrupt annual shareholder meetings.</p>
<p>The affair is now being investigated by Japan's Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission.</p>
<p>Even after the scandal broke, Nomura still managed to get lead-manager appointments in the samurai and Euro markets, including this week's dual currency samurai bond launched by NV Bank Nederlandse Gemeenten (BNG), underwriters said.</p>
<p>Including the BNG issue, Nomura has already acted as lead manager in five samurai issues, with volume amounting to 130 billion yen ($1.03 billion), since the scandal first broke in early March.</p>
<p>"Compared with the previous fiscal year, volume may have fallen a bit in samurai issues which Nomura has taken part as lead manager, but I don't think overseas borrowers are leaving out Nomura actively at this point," the source said. "Even if there is such a case that wouldn't be a major trend."</p>
<p>In the Eurobond market, Nomura has acted as lead manager for Austria's Oesterreichische Kontrollbank and Canada's Export Development Corp.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a Singapore subsidiary of Marubeni Corp, MIF Asia Ltd, announced that it had set a ceiling of $1.0 billion on issuance of Asian medium-term notes (MTN) and haD appointed to Nomura to lead manage for MIF.</p>
<p>Some overseas issuers, such as Japanese corporations, have decided to leave Nomura out of their bond syndicates, but this is expected to be only a temporary measure, traders said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said Nomura had underwritten 16 billion yen ($126 million) worth of domestic straight bonds so far this month, or 2.5 percent of the total issued so far in April. This compares with a 14 percent market share in the fiscal year which ended on March 31, the daily said.</p>
<p>"In terms of long-term debt financing, overseas issuers have little choice but to depend on either Nomura or Daiwa for smooth bond sales, given their nationwide sales network," said a manager at a U.S. brokerage firm.</p>
<p>"As for the move by MIF Asia Ltd, the point is that the MTN programme (lead-managed by Nomura) is not a one-time deal, but is aimed at laying down a long-term arrangement for MIF's fund-raising," the manager said.</p>
<p>The first issue under the programme may not come until long after the results of the probe by the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission and any punitive measures handed down against Nomura, traders said.</p>
<p>By then, even Japanese companies may resume bond underwriting in the domestic market with Nomura, they said. ($1=126 yen)</p>
