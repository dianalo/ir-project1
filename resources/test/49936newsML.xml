<title>LUXEMBOURG: Court upholds raw tobacco quota system.</title>
<headline>Court upholds raw tobacco quota system.</headline>
<dateline>LUXEMBOURG 1996-09-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Court of Justice rebuffed on Thursday attempts by Italian raw tabacco producers to get increased quotas from the Italian government.</p>
<p>Three tobacco producers challenged the EU quota system as invalid, and claimed damages were incurred from Italy's incorrect implementation of the quota rules. The producers are seeking higher quotas from the Italian government.</p>
<p>Answering claims of undue burden on tobacco producers, the court said that "contrary to the arguments put forward by applicants in the main proceedings, the administrative burden which the system of cultivation certificates imposes on processing undertakings is largely offset by the advantages which the system affords them."</p>
<p>The court upheld a flat-rate calculation system of reserves based on tobacco variety, and did not require the Italian government to take full account of actual losses suffered by producers.</p>
<p>The court said member states have a considerable margin of discretion in fixing cultivation certificates, but must allocate these certificate quotas under a system based on objective criteria.</p>

<p>on the interpretation of Council regulation (EEC) No 2075/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in raw tobacco(OJ 1992 L 215, p. 70) and on the validity and interpretation of certain provisions of Commission regulation (EEC) No 3477/92 of 1 December 1992 laying down detailed rules for the application of the raw tobacco quota system for the 1993 and 1994 harvests (OJ 1992 L 351, p. 11)</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>THE COURT hereby rules</p>
<p>1. Examination of the questions raised has disclosed no factor of such a kind as to affect the validity and interpretation of certain provisions of Commission regulation (EEC) No 3477/92 of 1 December 1992 laying down detailed rules for the application of the raw tobacco quota system for the 1993 and 1994 harvests.</p>
<p>2. Article 9(3) of regulation No 3477/92 does not preclude the establishment, in advance and according to a system of flat-rate calculation, of reserves varying according to the varieties of tobacco, which are intended for distribution among producers who have suffered a fall in production as a result of exceptional circumstances, without taking full account of the losses actually suffered by individual producers.</p>
<p>3. The third indent of article 2, in conjunction with article 21, of regulation No 3477/92 does not preclude national rules not allowing a single cultivation certificate or a single production quota to be given to a producer group founded with the aim of promoting and facilitating the cultivation of tobacco by its members, while at the same time undertaking the first processing of tobacco on its own premises.</p>
<p>4. Article 9(3)  of Council regulation ((EEC) No 2075/92 of 30 June 1992 on the common organization of the market in raw tobacco must be interpreted as meaning that processing undertakings may be divided into seven distinct groups, on condition that the processing quota is determined according to the rules of calculation prescribed for the group to which the sub-category in question belongs. Article 9(1) of regulation 3477/92 must be interpreted as meaning that producers may have different rules for calculating the processing quota applied to them depending on the processing undertaking to which they delivered during the reference period.</p>
