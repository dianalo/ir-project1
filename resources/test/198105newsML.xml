<p>An executives' salaries survey has found that senior New Zealand managers are markedly lower paid than their Australian equivalents, Hay Management Consultants said on Monday.</p>
<p>The survey by the Auckland-based group showed a chief or senior executive of a large New Zealand-based organisation (with turnover in excess of NZ$1 billion) is paid up to 40 percent less in terms of base salary than an Australian counterpart.  </p>
<p>At the other end of the scale, a chief executive of a small New Zealand-based oraganisation (typically with turnover of $20-$30 million) earns about 35 percent less than an equivalent across the Tasman.</p>
<p>Larger New Zealand organisations were more competitive with their Australian counterparts once bonus payments were included, although they still lagged behind Australian salaries by 19 percent.</p>
<p>In smaller companies, bonuses did not improve New Zealand managers' relative salaries.  </p>
<p>Hay Management Consultants surveyed 180 medium to large size companies on each side of the Tasman in October.</p>
