<p>Inco Ltd., the western world's biggest nickel producer, reported a steep drop in 1996 earnings on Tuesday, blaming lower metal prices.</p>
<p>Inco's fourth-quarter profit fell to $26 million, or 9 cents a share, from $60 million, or 45 cents a share, in the year earlier period.</p>
<p>Full-year profit declined to $179 million, or $1.09 a share, from $227 million, or $1.82 a share, in 1995.</p>
<p>"It's a consequence of lower realised nickel prices," Inco spokesman Bob Purcell said.</p>
<p>The Toronto-based company realised an average nickel price of $3.35 a pound in the fourth quarter of 1996 and $3.61 a pound for the year. Those prices declined from 1995 when prices averaged $3.90 in the fourth quarter and $3.86 for the year.</p>
<p>Inco produced 412 million pounds of nickel in 1996, up from 403 million pounds in 1995.</p>
<p>As usual, customers asked for more nickel from Inco than the company could produce, forcing Inco to buy nickel on the open market. Inco's profit margin on the purchased nickel is slim.</p>
<p>Inco bought 141 million pounds of nickel in 1996, down from 197 million pounds in 1995. The company's total nickel deliveries in 1996 dropped to 558 million pounds from 595 million pounds the year before.</p>
<p>Inco stock fell after the earnings were released. The market was disappointed since many analysts had forecast fourth-quarter earnings of 15 cents a share, analysts said.</p>
<p>Inco shares fell C35 cents to C$45.85 in late trading in Toronto, and were unchange at $34.125 on the New York Stock Exchange in late trading.</p>
