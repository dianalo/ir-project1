<p>Siddons Ramset Ltd said on Friday it has  agreed to buy the business of F.H. Prager, a leading wholesale distributor  of hardware and hand tools for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>Siddons managing director Roger Flynn said in a statement Prager had  a product range of several thousand items, marketing its own brands  and holding distribution rights for a number of international brands.</p>
<p>It was complementary to Siddons' existing Proline hardware supply  business and operating cost savings were expected, he said. -- Sydney  Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800</p>
