<p>Polish National Investment Fund (NFI) Magna Polonia (No.6) wants to invest up to $10 million this year, mostly in companies from its portfolio, the fund's manager said.</p>
<p>"The minimum plan envisages investment of $4-6 million. The maximum envisages $10 million. It seems we will rather go for the maximum version," Krzysztof Bialowolski said. "First of all we will invest in companies from our portfolio."</p>
<p>He said the fund had no plans to float any of its companies on the bourse this year but may introduce one or two firms to the stock exchange in 1998.</p>
<p>"Leather firm Brzeg is our candidate for flotation. We started work to make it public and we expect that it might be listed in 1998," Bialowolski said.</p>
<p>He said the fund's strategy was to increase stakes in chosen companies to some 10 percent from the current 1.93 percent and to sell stakes in the other firms.</p>
<p>NFI No.6, one of 15 such funds created under Poland's mass privatisation programme, has a 33 percent stake in 35 firms and 1.93 percent stakes in almost 500 other firms.</p>
<p>It wants to focus on companies involved in car production, chemicals and consumption goods.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of this year the fund had a net loss of 4.9 million zlotys against a 43.1 million net loss in the whole of 1996.</p>
<p>The 1996 loss was mainly a result of a ruling requiring former state-owned companies to recalculate depreciation for 1995 and the first nine months of 1996 based on gross value of assets rather then net value.</p>
