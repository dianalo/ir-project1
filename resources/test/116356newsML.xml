<p>Two Catholic women broke ranks with their church's official line against abortion on Tuesday, urging South Africa's parliament to adopt a proposed law which would allow abortion on demand.</p>
<p>Catholic Mary Armour told a parliamentary hearing her pro-choice stance was not rare, but silenced in the church by the unmarried priests who run it.</p>
<p>"To refuse women access to contraception as well as abortion is inhumane," said Armour, a theology graduate.</p>
<p>"(It) is unacceptable for a group of celibate men in a church in which women are barred from policy-making and the priesthood to both make and interpret moral laws on women's reproductive choices," she added.</p>
<p>South Africa's two-year-old all-race parliament is considering a draft law which would allow abortions up to the 12th week and for a further eight weeks in some circumstances.</p>
<p>The Catholic church opposes abortion for any reason and has called on the South African government to probe the underlying reasons for illegal backstreet abortions in South Africa.</p>
<p>Catholic church representative Noel Pistorius said any surgical or medical ending of pregnancy was an "infringement of an inalienable right to life and consequently gravely immoral".</p>
<p>But Helen Moffat, a Catholic doctor, said she was unable to support a ban on abortion after witnessing the hardships of uneducated black women who suffered worst.</p>
<p>"The grinding poverty and the hunger...where having another child means seeing your existing children go hungry: as a comfortable white middle-class woman, as a Christian, I cannot sit in judgment on these women," she said during the debate.</p>
<p>Moffat also called on Nelson Mandela's government to increase education on birth control particularly among people in poor rural areas.</p>
<p>Christian anti-abortion campaigners clashed with some members of parliament for a second day on Tuesday over the proposed law, which they said ignored majority opinion.</p>
<p>The campaigners also held a protest outside parliament on Tuesday, waving placards and handing anti-abortion literature to passers-by.</p>
<p>"Abortion is like apartheid," said one protester. "It discriminates against the unborn child."</p>
<p>At present only about 1,000 women a year qualify for legal abortions allowed under circumstances such as rape, incest and danger to the mother's life.</p>
<p>But official figures show that close to 50,000 women, overwhelmingly black, are hospitalised every year after botched backstreet abortions, from which 425 die.</p>
<p>Unofficial estimates say up to 120,000 women have illegal abortions in South Africa annually.</p>
<p>Women's rights groups and Mandela's ANC, which has a large majority in parliament, have thrown their weight behind relaxation of abortion laws.</p>
