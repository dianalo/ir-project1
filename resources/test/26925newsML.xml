<p>Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor Micah Cheserem said on Monday he had put another commercial bank under statutory management but dismissed fears that the Kenyan banking sector was in a crisis.</p>
<p>Cheserem said Heritage Bank, formerly called Export Bank of Africa, had been put under central bank statutory management after it failed to meet its obligations at the clearing house.</p>
<p>It was the second time that Heritage Bank had been put under statutory management. It was only reopened in May 1995 after a year of statutory supervision by the central bank.</p>
<p>Kenya Finance Bank was put under CBK management in July.</p>
<p>"The placing of Heritage Bank and Kenya Finance Bank under CBK statutoty management should not cause anxiety over Kenya's banking system since the two institutions have had a recent history of financial troubles," Cheserem said in a statement.</p>
<p>"We can state, with a high degree of confidence, that Kenya's overall banking system is stable and sound," he added.</p>
<p>Cheserem said it was the responsibility of banks and non-bank financial institutions to provide adequate funds to meet their cash ratio requirements. Cash ratio is the amount of money commercial banks and financial institutions have to deposit with the central bank at no interest at all.</p>
<p>He said supervision of the banking system would be intensified in collaboration with external auditors following recent meetings between the CBK and (the institute of) certified public accountants of Kenya.</p>
<p>"The majority of recent bank failures in Kenya were due to mismanagement and, in some instances, outright fraud by the directors and management," Cheserem said.</p>
