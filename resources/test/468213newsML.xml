<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Morgan upgrades Nucor.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- J.P. Morgan steel analyst Mike Gambardella said he upgraded Nucor Corp to market performer from market underperformer.</p>
<p>-- "We believe the risk of significant underperformance has been greatly reduced after declining 13 percent from when we initiated coverage 20 months ago," Gambardella said.</p>
<p>-- Gambardella said he also lowered his first-quarter estimate on Nucor to $0.70 per share from $0.80 per share.  </p>
<p>-- Gambardella said he lowered the estimate to reflect higher operating costs.</p>
<p>-- "We remain cautious on Nucor shares since we believe the dilemma facing management is not whether it follows recent integrated producer price hikes on hot-rolled steel, but whether it cuts hot-rolled prices," Gambardella said.</p>
