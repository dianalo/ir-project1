<p>The emigration rate of Hong Kong workers rose in 1996, the last full year before the British colony returns to Chinese rule, a survey by the Hong Kong Institute of Human Resource Management said on Thursday.</p>
<p>About 0.82 percent of the Hong Kong workforce emigrated last year, up from 0.76 percent in 1995, it said.</p>
<p>Concerns have been repeatedly raised in Hong Kong about a "brain drain" of professionals leaving the colony ahead of the July 1 handover of sovereignty to China.</p>
<p>But many of the emigrants return after obtaining foreign passports, which are seen as a form of insurance for the future.</p>
<p>The returnee rate -- the number of former residents who returned and were recruited in 1996 compared with the number who resigned in order to emigrate -- fell to 54 percent in 1996, down from 60 percent the year before, the institute said.</p>
<p>Most returnees and emigrants fitted a similar profile of professionals or managers with post-secondary school qualifications and aged 33 to 39, it quoted the survey of 180 Hong Kong companies as showing.</p>
<p>The most popular destination for emigrants was Canada, it said.</p>
