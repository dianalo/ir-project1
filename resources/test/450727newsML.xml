<p>Officials of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the stock market regulator, are scheduled to meet representatives of the stock exchanges this week, SEBI chairman D.R. Mehta said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The meeting in Bombay on Wednesday will focus on proposals to refine trading margins in the stock markets, Mehta told reporters after a business conference in New Delhi. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Earlier, Mehta said in response to a question at the conference that SEBI was not against short-selling, but only wanted short sales positions in bourses to be declared in a transparent manner.</p>
<p>"We have not banned short-selling. I don't know how you get the impression," Mehta said.</p>
