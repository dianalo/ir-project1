<p>Brent crude futures firmed on Friday as profit taking on the week's losses continued.</p>
<p>But brokers said overall sentiment remained bearish amid rising U.S. stocks and Iraqi crude exports.</p>
<p>January Brent last traded on SIMEX at $22.80 per barrel, up 28 cents from the London settlement. January Brent settled last Friday in London at $23.74.</p>
<p>Brokers said short covering was driving prices higher and the firmer tone was led by NYMEX crude trading on ACCESS.</p>
<p>NYMEX January crude was last traded at $23.95, up from the New York close of $23.72.  </p>
<p>One broker said a chart gap on January Brent between $23.07 and $23.24 would be targetted by players, but he doubted the gap would be filled.</p>
<p>Turkey's Anatolian news agency said earlier on Friday that Iraqi oil was to be loaded onto a ship this weekend from Ceyhan for Turkey's state-owned company Tupras.</p>
