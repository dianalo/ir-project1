<p>Opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi said on Thursday that Italy's mini-budget, which was approved by the cabinet earlier, was "a sham that has no effect on the mechanisms of public spending."</p>
<p>Berlusconi also brushed aside an appeal by Prime Minister Romano Prodi for unity in tackling welfare reform.  </p>
<p>"Prodi's request is untimely," the media mogul and former prime minister told reporters at his Forza Italia party headquarters. "We are always open and willing to collaborate in the interests of the country, but when you carry out political actions like that of this morning, how can you then ask someone to lend a hand to do something unknown."</p>
<p>Berlusconi had hoped the government would unveil a very different package. Berlusconi said his judgement on the corrective package, intended to raise 15.5 trillion lire ($9.2 billion) in 1997 and cut the deficit to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP), was "very negative."  </p>
<p>"It does not cut the privileges, the wastage, the abuses and the injustices," he declared.</p>
<p>Berlusconi said the mini-budget distanced Italy from Europe because it was built on accounting devices.</p>
<p>"While Europe asked for a genuine package the government has behaved like someone who, instead of cleaning the house, sweeps the rubbish under the carpet or the table."</p>
<p>The mini-budget, which has to be approved by parliament, contained measures that included forcing firms to pay taxes on huge severance payment funds two years ahead of time.</p>
<p>Firms have warned that any raids on these resources would harm trade at a weak moment in the business cycle.</p>
