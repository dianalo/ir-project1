<p>Manila overnight money slipped to an average of 9.9375 percent from 10.03125 percent after the Central Bank dropped its overnight borrowing rate to 9.9 from 10.0 percent, traders said.</p>
<p>Moreover, the immediate closure of the Central Bank's overnight borrowing facility left banks very liquid, traders said. The Central Bank said it had little borrowing requirements and had to close the facility early.  </p>
<p>The Central Bank said the cut in its overnight rates was meant to align with domestic interest rates despite a 0.25 percentage point hike in the U.S. federal funds rate.</p>
<p>Done rates were in a lower band from 10.15625 to 9.875 percent. Volume fell to 10.891 billion from 18.322 billion pesos.</p>
<p>In the secondary market trading of T-bills, there was little activity ahead of the Easter holidays, traders said.</p>
<p>Banks, however, were buying short-term bills to meet the requirements of clients, they said.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of six financial institutions gave bid rates of 9.675 to 9.80 percent on the three-month bills.</p>
