<p>Ukraine's sugar harvest is experiencing big delays, with only 10 percent of beets lifted, a senior aide to the deputy prime minister responsible for agriculture said.</p>
<p>"At the moment, only 10 percent of the beets have been brought out of the ground," Dmytro Stetsenko said by telephone. We are far behind."  </p>
<p>"Work in the fields should be completed in October and beets brought to refineries throughout November," he said.</p>
<p>He blamed much of the delay on chronic fuel shortages.</p>
<p>The government, he said, was preparing an order within the next two weeks to buy four million tonnes of Russian oil for the sugar beet harvest, processing of sunflowers and rice in southern Ukraine and fertiliser distribution.  </p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Zubets, speaking in parliament on Thursday, said more than 200,000 hectares of sugar beet been lifted -- out of a total 1.306 million ha.</p>
<p>He said equipment breakdowns were complicating the harvest, with only 14,000 of 18,000 combines in working order.</p>
<p>"If we get good weather everything can be completed by October," he said. "The weather forecast is good until the end of the month."</p>
<p>He said the officially forecast harvest of 26 million tonnes of beet remained on course. About 100 of Ukraine's 191 refineries were functioning with the rest ready to begin work.</p>
<p>A total of 150,000 tonnes of sugar had been processed to date from 1.8 million tonnes of beet.</p>
