<p>Top officials of Sony Corp said in Hungary on Thursday that the company intends to expand in Eastern Europe and finds the region competitive with Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>"We have a strong intention to expand our manufacturing in East and central Europe," Sony president Nobuyuki Idei told Reuters during a meeting for Sony suppliers in Hungary.</p>
<p>Idei did not announce any specific plans for expansion by Sony, which now has east European manufacturing plants in Hungary and Slovakia, but said a quarter of the company's business, or some $11 to $12 billion in revenues, originated in Europe.</p>
<p>"Central and East Europe represents about 10 percent of total European business," Idei said. "So I think a local investment for manufacturing will also accelerate our penetration of these markets."</p>
<p>Jakob Schmuckli, a director of Sony Corporation and chairman of Sony Europa Gmbh, said that on a landed cost basis, Eastern Europe could potentially compete with Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>"Of course Malaysia (one of Sony's biggest manufacturing bases) is huge...but I think it is indicative of Europe as a production base at least for the European market that with the central and Eastern European countries we do have a possibility to compete with a Southeast Asian supply base at least on a landed-cost basis," Schmuckli said.</p>
<p>"We believe with the opening of eastern Europe, definitely Europe has a chance to re-establish itself as one of the global supply bases," he added.</p>
<p>Schmuckli said Sony was still in the initial stages with its 30 million German mark home audio-video plant in Godollo, Hungary, but planned to expand it soon from its current 300 workers to 600 or more.</p>
<p>"We are still on the start-up phase," he said. "So far we have hired 300 workers but we already know we will go to 600 or more. That part is already decided, but from there it will take time."</p>
<p>Asked whether the quality of products at the plant was what Sony desired, Schmuckli said: "It is a bit early to tell.</p>
<p>"It depends on the management and workers at the plant -- if they work well they have the best chance...to move it up" and expand the facility, Schmuckli said.</p>
