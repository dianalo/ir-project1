<p>Czech shares took another beating on Monday as the sustained downtrend of the last two to three weeks showed no sign of coming to an end and foreign investors continued to stay on the sidelines.</p>
<p>The PX50 index fell five points, 0.9 percent, to 558.4 with dealers predicting that the market could easily go lower as the week progresses.</p>
<p>"It is a mystery to judge when the market will hit bottom," said Petr Opocensky of Citicorp Securities.</p>
<p>"The Czech Republic is looking very weak," added Ivan Kusacek of Zivnostenska Banka.</p>
<p>Some local analysts also warned that a monthly emerging markets report published on Monday by Robert Fleming &amp; Co could add further momentum to the PX50's descent.</p>
<p>Flemings said that investors should be underweight on the Czech market because of concerns about macroeconomic problems.</p>
<p>One local dealer who did not wish to be named commenting on another bank's report said: "This could really hit the market."</p>
<p>Most major issues again bore the brunt of Monday's decline.</p>
<p>SPT Telecom closed down 54 crowns, 1.5 percent, to 3,440 on the PX50 index putting the issue 10.6 percent below its price of one month ago.</p>
<p>"I think the whole market can go more down and also SPT," said Kusacek.</p>
<p>SPT is the most heavily weighted Czech share accounting for over 20 percent of the PX50 index's capitalisation and often exerting a decisive influence on the direction of the market.</p>
<p>It posted powerful gains in the first weeks of trading this year and outperformed the PX50 as a whole. But since the current bear run began, led by foreign investor concerns about the economy, that trend has been reversed.</p>
<p>In the last month SPT has fallen 10.6 percent compared with 7.5 percent for the PX50 index.</p>
<p>"Fundamentally, I don't see anything new just lower interest in the market...when the market was at the top a few weeks ago Telecom was one of the most expensive and lots of people expected the price to go lower," said Kusacek.</p>
<p>Power utility CEZ was the one blue chip to move higher. It rose 20 crowns to 1,040.</p>
