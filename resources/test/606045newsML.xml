<p>The challenge by European Competition chief Karel Van Miert to the proposed merger between Boeing Co. and McDonnell Douglas Corp. is a risky gamble that could spark a transatlantic dispute.</p>
<p>Ignoring claims that the United States is better-placed to deal with the case and accusations that he is catering to the interests of Europe's Airbus consortium, Boeing's only serious competitor, Van Miert warned the two companies of his concerns in a statement issued late Thursday.</p>
<p>Seattle-based Boeing immediately reacted, again denying that the deal would restrict competition and reiterating that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission should be given the prime responsibility for vetting it.</p>
<p>The EU Commission has repeatedly said it has the power to probe and, if need be, set conditions on the $14 billion deal, arguing that it is strictly applying EU rules aimed at preventing creation or strengthening of dominant positions in the Union.</p>
<p>The Boeing/McDonnell Douglas deal is one of two major proposed alliances being investigated by the Commission. The other is the linkup between British Airways and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines.</p>
<p>Newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic have speculated about prospects for a nasty trade dispute. A group of U.S. senators has asked President Clinton to ensure that the EU's review of the Boeing/McDonnell Douglas deal was fair and not driven by political considerations.</p>
<p>While saying it is difficult to imagine a way out of the corner that both parties have put themselves in with their strong statements, most analysts and antitrust lawyers believe a compromise will be found. They stress that both the U.S. authorities and Boeing accept that the EU has jurisdiction over the merger and, therefore, must also accept that the EU may have reservations.</p>
<p>"I think it's unlikely that this would result in a trade war. I would think that it would be in both parties' interests to reach an amicable resolution given the large stakes involved," said Randolph Tritell, a partner with law firm Weil Gotshall &amp; Manges.</p>
<p>Tritell noted that the United States also often asserts jurisdiction over extraterritorial transactions that have an effect on its soil. Last year the FTC approved the merger between Swiss drug companies Sandoz and Ciba Geigy only after ordering a $780 million divestiture.</p>
<p>Speculating about a war before knowing what the FTC thinks, whether or not it shares the EU's concerns, was putting the cart before the horse, another lawyer said.</p>
<p>"It's idle to speculate at this point whether there will be a war before we see whether there is a jurisdictional conflict. We don't know what the FTC thinks," he said.</p>
<p>Van Miert last week shrugged off suggestions of a trade war as "totally nonsensical."</p>
<p>U.S. government officials in Brussels said Thursday they thought politicians were likely to keep out of the issue until the European Commission and the FTC completed their review. They said Clinton was not expected to discuss the merger at a regular meeting next Wednesday in the Hague with Commission President Jacques Santer and Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, whose country currently holds the EU presidency.</p>
<p>"The president will be hard put to comment because we are still looking at it," one official said.</p>
<p>While nobody really contests the EU's competence to probe the merger, there has been some frowning at Van Miert's public aggressive stance even before Boeing formally submitted the deal for clearance last December.</p>
<p>McDonnell Douglas CEO Harry Stonecipher said recently that Van Miert's public statements were "totally inappropriate." "It's obvious he wants a war, but I don't want a war," he told reporters in Washington.</p>
<p>Sources close to Van Miert said he was unlikely to be taken aback by such criticism, but they were anxious to bring a more serene tone to the debate and to insist that negotiation, not confrontation, was the key.</p>
<p>Since he took over the competition portfolio in 1993, Van Miert has become increasingly confident of ensuring a level playing ground for businesses in the 15-nation bloc. He has repeatedly shown he is not frightened of upsetting large companies or powerful governments, and so far, he has been followed by his 19 colleagues on all important cases almost without exception.</p>
