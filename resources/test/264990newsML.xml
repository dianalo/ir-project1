<p>Belgium's Antwerp Shiprepair NV said on Wednesday it signed a $2 million contract, its largest ever, to replace 152 tonnes of steel in the hull of the Turkish bulk carrier ESRA 1.</p>
<p>"The ship ran aground in the port of Antwerp and suffered steel damage in the bottom," Antwerp Shiprepair's Commercial Director Jaap Hameete told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>Hameete said the 124,000 dwt capsized ESRA 1 is due to be delivered on January 31. The contract was won last week after an international subscription.</p>
<p>"After inspection it became clear that 152 tonnes of steel had to be changed in the fore part of the ship where it hit the ground," Hameete said.</p>
<p>The ESRA 1 is owned by Turkish Alba Ship Management, which is part of the Marti concern, he said. It also sails under Turkish flag.</p>
<p>Antwerp Shiprepair was launched in December 1994 on a 30-hectare site in the hear of the port of Antwerp following difficult takeover negotiations in the wake of the 1993 bankruptcy of Belgian Mercantile-Beliard.</p>
<p>The main partner in Antwerp Shiprepair is Kopcke Belgium (51 percent), part of Dutch ship's stores and spares company Kopcke Group, with 51 percent.</p>
<p>Other shareholders are Flemish regional government holding and investment company Gimvindus (25 percent) and Belgian Oil Services Marpobel (24 percent).</p>
<p>The yard's repair services include six dry docks, the largest capable of handling ships up to 180,000 dwt.</p>
<p>Hameete said the contract would not create any extra jobs at Antwerp Shiprepair, which was set up with a workforce of 155.</p>
<p>"Shiprepairing goes in huge waves. Four weeks ago we had no ship lying in the dockyards. Now it's full again," Hameete said.</p>
<p>"Whenever we face sudden staff shortages we go to the subcontractors market," he said.</p>
<p>He added that no other major contracts were immediately expected. "You never plan such things in advance."</p>
<p>He said Antwerp Shiprepair's set-up was tailor-made for the Belgian market and had enabled the firm to stay out of the red.</p>
<p>It made a modest profit in its first 18-month financial year from December 1994 to end of June 1996, he said.</p>
