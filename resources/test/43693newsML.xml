<p>Brazilian retail trade is placing more orders with factories in expectation of rising sales towards the end of the year, a financial newspaper said.</p>
<p>A weekly economic survey by MCM Consultants shows that factory stocks are growing, especially stocks of consumer goods, which signal expectations of rising sales, Gazeta Mercantil said.</p>
<p>MCM economist Ana Cristina Goncalves da Costa said more flexible consumer credit conditions, improved agricultural incomes and pay rises should stimulate sales towards the end of the year, Gazeta said.  </p>
<p>Despite growth prospects in the coming months, industrial production should grow only one percent in the whole of 1996, according to Costa.</p>
<p>She said it would be difficult to reach even one percent growth given the 3.25 percent fall in industrial production between January and June compared with the same period last year.</p>
