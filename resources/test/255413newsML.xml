<p>Transport ministers tied up the second day of their December Council on Friday after debates on two maritime files and the adoption of an amended resolution on the European Commission's maritime strategy.</p>
<p>Council reached political agreement on proposal COM(96)255 for a Council directive setting up a harmonised safety regime for fishing vessels that are at least 24 metres long.</p>
<p>The draft is intended to apply to EU boats and those of third countries which fish in EU member states' waters or unload their catches in EU ports.</p>
<p>It covers boat certification, construction, equipment, stability, machines and fittings, fire prevention, safety equipment and procedures, and radio-communication and navigational equipment.</p>
<p>It will extend to boats that are shorter than 45 metres but at least 24 metres long, the requirements of the 1977 Torremolinos Convention.</p>
<p>The draft also provides for the creation of a committee procedure to produce harmonised interpretations for the Community of various discretionary requirements foreseen for parties to the Convention.</p>
<p>A draft Council statement said ministers also reached political agreement on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/75/EEC on minimum requirements for vessels bound for or leaving Community ports and carrying dangerous or polluting goods.</p>
<p>The proposal, COM(96)455, would extend the existing directive to the carriage on board ships of irradiated nuclear fuel, plutonium and highly radioactive wastes.</p>
<p>The proposal also alters the comitology procedure of the existing directive.</p>
<p>Finally, ministers adopted a revised resolution generally welcoming the Commission's maritime strategy, the main issue taking up time being Britain's refusal to accept language referring to points on state aid for seafarer training.</p>
<p>It was unclear on Friday whether the presidency would adopt these paragraphs as its own conclusions or whether the rest of the text remained as it had been before the Council.</p>
