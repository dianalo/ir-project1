<p>One of Italy's top fashion design houses, Gianni Versace, will continue to slash prices across its full range of designer clothes and accessories in preparation for a flotation on the Milan stock market by June 1998.</p>
<p>Santo Versace, brother of world renowned designer Gianni and chairman of the group Gianni Versace, said on Tuesday the group will continue to cut prices in its autumn/winter 1997/98 season giving average price cuts of 15-20 percent in the last two years.</p>
<p>He hopes that the price cut move will boost volume sales and increase productivity and hence profit margins will be maintained. He stresses there will be no reduction in quality.</p>
<p>Gianni Versace is due to show its autumn/winter 1997/98 collection at the Milan fashion show later this week.</p>
<p>"We have cut our prices for the last three seasons and after the next season the average cut in prices will be 15-20 percent," said Versace in an interview with Il Sole 24 Ore.</p>
<p>He added that a planned flotation for the end of 1997 had to be delayed as the group wanted to complete its restructuring. He now sees a Milan listing by June 1998, and adds that the group is interested in a listing on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The Milan-based fashion house saw 1996 sales up 23.5 percent at 845 billion lire ($500 million), which of 80 percent is sold abroad, and Versace sees a further 20 percent rise in sales in 1997.</p>
<p>Some 56 percent of sales were in clothing, with accessories accounting for 25 percent, perfumes 15 percent, and household furnishing items some four percent.</p>
<p>Group pretax profits for the year 1996 rose 13.6 percent to 175 billion lire. ($1=1,704)</p>
