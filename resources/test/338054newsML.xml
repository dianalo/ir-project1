<p>Parliamentarians from the Council of Europe's 40 member states called on Thursday for caution in pursuing European Monetary Union in the European Union, the Council said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The European Council assembly welcomed the potential benefits of EMU, such as currency stability and a common economic policy, but warned that it should not hamper European Union enlargement, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>EMU would lead to a loss of national sovereignty and EU countries should assess the impact of EMU on their national economies and how to make it democratically accountable.  </p>
<p>The reporter for the assembly's report on EMU, Mikko Elo of Finland, said EMU was the EU's key project and if it failed, it would be a political failure.</p>
<p>Assembly speakers underlined the need for democracy and transparency and said a future European Central Bank should be democratically accountable. A social dimension should be included in the move to economic union.</p>
<p>They also raised concerns that there would be a widening gap between rich and poor.</p>
<p>A single currency would affect the whole of Europe and not just the EU countries, economic affairs committee chairman Terry Davis said.</p>
<p>"It is vitally important to ensure that EU attempts to stabilise the European economy do not stabilise European society as a result of cuts in welfare spending in order to satisfy the Maastricht criteria," he said.</p>
