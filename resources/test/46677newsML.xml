<p>Higher food and energy prices have not yet sent the core inflation rate higher but if they do it would be a cause for concern, Michael Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago told the Chicago Tribune during an interview published Wednesday.</p>
<p>"If the increases in food and energy start working their way into core inflation -- and people's expectations for inflation increase -- it clearly could be an area of concern," Moskow said. "We have not seen that happen so far."</p>
<p>Moskow made the comments earlier in the week in an interview with the Tribune, a Chicago Fed spokeswoman said.  </p>
<p>Moskow also said that sentiment in the Chicago Fed's five-state region was "upbeat," with some rural areas, particularly in Indiana and Iowa, attracting more manufacturing operations.</p>
<p>The Fed is also continuing its study on the Midwest's strong pace of economic growth compared to the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>"We got a wakeup call 10 years ago from foreign competition," Moskow said. "Many of our companies have restructured their operations, with the result that we probably are now the low-cost producer of the nation."  </p>
<p>Moskow, who is a non-voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) this year, said he expects to remain as Chicago Fed president until 2003 when he turns 65, the Fed's mandatory retirement age.</p>
<p>This afternoon, the Chicago Fed will announce revisions in its Midwest Manufacturing Index and offer an assessment of the region's current manufacturing activity</p>
<p>The Chicago Fed Midwest Manufacturing Index, which began in 1987, is a composite index of 16 manufacturing industries and provides a regional comparison with the manufacturing component of the Index Production Index compiled by the Federal Reserve Board.
