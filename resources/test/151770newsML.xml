<p>A US$2 million champion stallion in New Zealand has been put on an experimental fertility programme previously used on human males after failing to match his racecourse success on the stud farm.</p>
<p>Maroof was a cut above most of his opposition on the European racing scene, but managed just 22 successes in 65 attempts as a sire, the New Zealand Press Association reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It cost NZ$27,500 (US$20,000) every time he failed to deliver.</p>
<p>Now, Maroof is being tried on a revolutionary fertility programme under the control of Auckland University.</p>
<p>Cambridge Stud owner Patrick Hogan is buoyed by an improved mare pregnancy success rate of eight from 13 servings by Maroof this year.</p>
<p>"It is entirely experimental and has never been tried on a horse before. He is under a similar programme to that used on human males with fertility problems," Hogan said.</p>
<p>"It is early days, but those results have given us a great lift and we are very satisfied with them."</p>
<p>Hogan would not disclose details of the treatment due to commercial sensitivity, but said the course helped the horse's sperm to mature.</p>
<p>On the track, Maroof was the champion European four-year-old in 1994 and won the group one Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Royal Ascot, England.</p>
