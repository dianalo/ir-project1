<p>British parents find sponsorship of children's television programmes preferable to advertising, but parents worry that children aged eight to 12 are too impressionable and will pester them to buy expensive toys, according to a new study released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Britain's Independent Television Commission said results of the study, 'Sponsorship of Children's Programmes,' '...suggests that most parents interviewed preferred sponsorship to advertising because it was less intrusive, although a minority believed that it was possibly more manipulative than traditional advertising.'</p>
<p>Children, however, found sponsorship acceptable and said their parents don't know what they watch on television. Older children said they have learned not to tell their parents if advertising has sparked their desire for a product -- and said they would apply the same approach to sponsored products if necessary, the study found.</p>
<p>The study involved group interviews with about 100 parents and children, ranging in age from seven to 15.</p>
<p>Parents correctly believed that programme sponsorship was only recently introduced in Britain and also felt sponsorship was increasing. But many believed sponsorship more prevalent than it actually is, with many believed about 20 percent of programmes are sponsored, the study found.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the ITC said fewer than 10 percent of British television programmes are sponsored and said the actual figure is probably closer to five percent.</p>
<p>Sponsorship involves the payment of fees to a television company by any party other than a broadcaster to meet the costs and transmission of a programme.</p>
<p>Sponsorship has only been permitted since the introduction of the 1990 Broadcast Act. The first UK television programme to be sponsored -- by Croft Sherry -- was 'Rumpole of the Bailey' on Thames Television in 1991-92.</p>
<p>Sponsors may receive credits at both the beginning and end of programmes, with front credits for a single sponsor limited to 15 seconds in length and end credits limited to 10 seconds.</p>
<p>Most adults interviewed for the study claimed not to pay much attention to sponsorship messages and not to be influenced by them -- in the same way that consumers tend to dismiss advertising as ineffective.</p>
<p>Parents were least concerned about sponsorship of pre-school programmes, because they believed young children do not understand the device. Sponsorship of teen-age programmes was also of little concern, because teenagers are believed to be more independent and able to make their own decisions about products.</p>
<p>But parents worry that children ages eight to 12 are very impressionable and will pester them for expensive or violent toys. Parents also said some sponsor categories are inappropriate -- including toys, clothing and tobacco and alcohol, the study found.</p>
<p>Children and many parents mistakenly believe that sponsorship money is directly re-invested into producing the sponsored programme.</p>
<p>The ITC said its current regulations on sponsorship address most of the concerns raised by the study participants. The sponsorship code aims to keep television compaanies -- and not sponsors -- in control of the content and scheduling of programmes, prohibits references to any advertiser or sponsor, or its products or services, within a programme, and prohibits product placement.</p>
