<p>Kellstrom Industries Inc said Thursday it declared a dividend distribution of one preferred share purchase right on each outstanding share of Kellstrom common stock.</p>
<p>The company said it would be "beneficial for stockholders to implement a stockholders' rights plan at this time."  </p>
<p>The rights would be exercisable if a person or group bought 19 percent or more of Kellstrom's common stock or launched a tender offer for 19 percent or more of the company's common stock, it said.</p>
<p>Typically, such rights are issued as an anti-takeover or "poison pill" measure intended to thwart a hostile takeover.</p>
<p>But company spokeswoman Linda Latman said the move was not in response to any action by any particular investment group. Instead, the move should encourage anyone seeking to acquire the compamy to negotiate with the board, she noted.  </p>
<p>In a statement, the commercial jet engine and parts leasing and marketing company said each right would entitle stockholders to buy one one-hundredth of a share of a new series of preferred stock at an exercise price of $80.</p>
<p>Among other things, if Kellstrom were acquired in a merger or other combination after a person or group bought 19 percent or more of its common stock, a rights holder could buy, at the rights' current exercise price, the acquiring company's common shares with a market value twice that price.  The dividend distribution will be made January 26 to stockholders of record on that day. The rights expire Jan. 14, 2007.  </p>
<p>In the statement, Yoav Stern and Zivi Nedivi, co-chairman and president, respectively, justified the Kellstrom board's move, saying the company had just completed acquisition of International Aircraft Support LP and the anticipated exercise of Kellstrom's publicly traded warrants.</p>
<p>They said the rights will assure Kellstrom stockholders of fair and equal treatment in any proposed takeover and guard against any partial tender offers, "squeeze outs" and other abusive tactics to gain control without paying a premium.</p>
<p>As of August, filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show that TCW Group held an 11.1 percent stake or 342,100 common shares in Kellstrom.</p>
