<p>A Gulf Cooperation Council committee has drafted a set of rules to allow regional banks to open branches in the six member states, the GCC said in a statement received on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The GCC's central banks and financial institutions committee met in the Saudi capital Riyadh on Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>"The committee agreed on a draft for control measures to permit national banks of GCC states to open branches in member states," the council said.</p>
<p>The GCC -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain -- is a political and economic alliance. It is working to unify economic and monetary policies as part of a plan to set up a regional market.</p>
<p>The GCC has also been discussing a plan to link commercial bank automated teller (ATM) machines.</p>
<p>Individual banks within some GCC states have linked their ATM machines, and some banks offer ATM services at their foreign branches. But as yet there is no Gulf-wide system permitting customers to access their own accounts at any ATM.</p>
