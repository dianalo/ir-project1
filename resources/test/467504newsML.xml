<p>Finnish food, feed and chemicals group Raision Tehtaat Oy said in a statement on Tuesday its Chemicals business group had bought 51 percent of Spanish rosin sizing company Echeveste Resinatos S.A.</p>
<p>The price of the deal was not disclosed. Raisio said it bought the holding from members of the Echeveste family, who would remain minority shareholders of the company, which will be renamed Raisio Echeveste S.A.</p>
<p>The company mainly produces rosin sizing for the paper industry, Raisio said.  </p>
<p>Raisio Echeveste will supply products to France and Portugal as well as Spain, and is expected to have good growth potential, Raisio said.</p>
<p>"The deal will give Raisio Chemicals more rosin sizing manufacturing capacity and technology related to cationic rosin sizing production," Raisio Chemicals managing director Tor Bergman said in the statement.</p>
<p>In 1996, the Spanish company's turnover was about 200 million pesetas. It currently employs five people, Raisio said. --Helsinki newsroom +358-9-680 50 245, e-mail news@reuters.fi</p>
