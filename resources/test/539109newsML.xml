<p>The ringgit was slightly lower in late Asian trading on fresh fund unwinding of long positions against the Singapore dollar, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said the unwinding was expected to continue through the evening, but at a slow pace as most players were cautious ahead of the Group-of-Seven meeting over the weekend.</p>
<p>"The unwinding was triggered by some perceived uncertainties in Malaysia like cabinet reshuffle," said a dealer with a Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>He said Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's denial of rumour on Thursday had little impact on the market.  </p>
<p>"The activity will be sharply reduced later today. Most of it will be position adjusting," another dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was waiting for a fresh leads such as the February trade data, expected early next week.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT, the ringgit was at 2.5075/85 a dollar and at 1.7355.74 a Singapore dollar.</p>
