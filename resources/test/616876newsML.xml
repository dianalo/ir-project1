<p>U.S. crude oil and refined products prices were steady in early ACCESS trade after tumbling through a correction in the earlier floor session on Tuesday, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders after-hours appeared to be catching their collective breath and waiting for the weekly American Petroleum Institute stocks estimates to assess their next move, traders said.</p>
<p>"I think everyone is kind of sitting back," one trader said of the mood in the after-hours session. "People are looking for direction on the API's coming out."</p>
<p>The NYMEX oil complex on Tuesday moved lower after a surge in speculative positions taken out in recent weeks left the market long on crude oil as trade resumed following the three-day holiday weekend.</p>
<p>July crude oil was bid $20.79 a barrel with 258 front-month lots traded, unchanged after closing down 84 cents a barrel in the floor session.</p>
<p>July heating oil was bid 55.25 cents a gallon, rebounding slightly after closing down 2.26 cents at 55.22 cents a gallon. There were 329 lots traded, including 36 in the front-month contract, traders said.</p>
<p>July gasoline was bid 63 cents a gallon, unchanged after settling off 1.90 cents a gallon on the day. Trade was thin, with 168 lots traded early in the session.</p>
