<p>Britain and the United States want the Security Council to impose new sanctions on Iraq for blocking U.N. weapons teams several times this month, saying this constituted a pattern of defiance by Baghdad.</p>
<p>The measures include preventing Iraqi government officials, members of the  army and police and their immediate families from travelling abroad and suspending reviews of trade sanctions against Iraq until Baghdad cooperates, according to a draft resolution obtained by Reuters.</p>
<p>But China's U.N. spokesman Chen Ranfeng said his country and several others believed that the draft was "a disproportionate response to events." Egypt, France and Russia are known to object also, reflecting a continuing split in the council on how to deal with Iraq.</p>
<p>Council President Sergei Lavrov said consultations among experts would continue on Thursday and the full council would discuss the issue on Friday again.</p>
<p>The council last Friday issued a relatively mild statement deploring a series of incidents in which U.N. inspectors said Iraqi personnel aboard U.N. helicopters, or Iraqi helicopters flying nearby, had endangered the U.N. craft and their crews assisting U.N. ground teams.</p>
<p>Since then inspectors have been turned away from three sites they attemted to visit. One was at a university where professors were known to have been involved in a biological weapons programme and where one employee tried to escape with a batch of papers.</p>
<p>Iraq has been under stringent trade sanctions since its troops invaded Kuwait in August 1990. One condition for lifting exports on oil is to scrap its weapons of mass destruction and related documents. The council maintains U.N. inspectors are to have free access to suspected sites.</p>
<p>British Ambassador Sir John Weston told reporters that he and several other members believed there needed to be a "firm, clear and rapid response by the council to what nobody has denied are clear violations by the Government of Iraq."</p>
<p>Chief U.N. arms inspector Rolf Ekeus  on Wednesday called for a firm reaction by the Security Council to what he said was Iraq's "clear violation" of council resolutions.</p>
<p>"If Iraq is allowed now to decide what we should inspect, when we should inspect it, I think the value of the whole mechanism set up after the Gulf War would be put into question," he said, referring to the U.N. special commission (UNSCOM) in charge of scrapping the dangerous arms and making sure they are not replaced.</p>
<p>Ekeus, who will leave UNSCOM on July 1 and will be succeeded by Australian U.N. envoy Richard Butler, speculated it "may be because we are changing leadership of the special commission that Iraq is now trying to change the ground rules somewhat."</p>
<p>Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, in a recent letter to the Security Council, said access to some sites had recently been denied because of concern that the inspections were not to carry out UNSCOM's mandate but to "detect the arrangements made for the security of Iraq, its leadership and the personnel involved."</p>
<p>Aziz said the UNSCOM team concerned was allowed to inspect 40 out of the 43 sites to which it sought access. Denial of access to the other sites "cannot be interpreted as a decision by the government of Iraq to prevent the special commission implementing its mandate, as Mr Ekeus alleges," he added.</p>
