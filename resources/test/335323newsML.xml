<p>Ashton Mining of Canada Inc said on Monday the first two holes in a program of dilling in north-central Alberta have intersected kimberlitic rocks.</p>
<p>The drill holes on two separate geophysical anomalies are the first in an initial program designed to test 10 anomalies, all of which display the characteristics of kimberlite-style volcanism.</p>
<p>Ashton is operator of the program, a potential joint venture between Ashton, Pure Gold Resources Inc and an unnamed Alberta energy company.  </p>
<p>In a previously announced deal, Ashton and Pure Gold entered into an option agreement with a large Alberta energy company whereby Pure Gold has funded the first C$500,000 of exploration and Ashton has the option to fund the next C$5 million to earn interests of 15 and 42.5 percent respectively, after which the three would form a joint venture.</p>
<p>Ashton said after penetrating 34 metres (113 feet) of glacial sediments the first vertical diamond drill hole on anomaly 7B passed into olivine-dominated fragmental and tuffaceous material displaying possible crater and diatreme facies textures.  </p>
<p>The drill hole remained in this volcanic-textured material until termination at 154 metres (505 feet).</p>
<p>Ashton said a second vertical hole on separate anomaly 7C penetrated 36.6 metres (120 feet) of glacial overburden and passed into kimberlitic rocks similar to those in the first hole. It remained in these volcanic rocks to a depth of 91.4 metres (300 feet), at which point it was abandoned because of difficult drilling conditions.</p>
<p>Drilling is now continuing on a third anomaly, Ashton said.</p>
<p>Ashton said it interpreted the rock types to represent pipes (diatremes) which have intruded from the basement through a thick column of overlying younger sediments to the pre-glacial surface. The core will be tested for indicator minerals and diamond content by Ashton, and petrographic studies will be undertaken to determine the diamond potential of this discovery.</p>
<p>Ashton called the results from the first two holes "highly encouraging" and said it is optimistic that they may prove to represent a new kimberlite province in Canada.</p>
