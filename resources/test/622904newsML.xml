<p>A committee charged with planning the restructuring and eventual privatisation of South African state diamond company Alexkor said on Thursday that deadlock had been reached over corporate governance.</p>
<p>The Restructuring and Transformation Committee (RTC) said there had been a disagreement with the shareholder -- the government -- on the issue.</p>
<p>It gave no further details but said the issue had been referred to the Inter-ministerial Co-ordinating Committee.</p>
<p>"In the light of this deadlock, the chairperson of the RTC (restructuring and transformation committee) has withdrawn from the process until resolution has been achieved and the RTC has suspended its operations until further notice," it said in a statement.</p>
<p>The government is considering the sale of up to 100 percent of the Namaqualand diamond mine as part of its continuing privatisation programme.</p>
