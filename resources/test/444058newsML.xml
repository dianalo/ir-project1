<p>Britain's water industry watchdog Ofwat said on Friday it was moving forward the date water companies must submit their audited regulatory accounts and related information to July 15 from September 30.</p>
<p>Ofwat said the six-month period currently in place was "too long."</p>
<p>"The companies already submit much of the information contained in the Regulatory Accounts to Ofwat in early July...The Director, therefore, considers it reasonable to expect the companies to finalise their accounts at the same time," Ofwat said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Ofwat said the next price review in 1999 would see an initial cut in prices and customers should see 55 percent of any savings.</p>
<p>Britain's water companies have come under heavy public criticism since privatisation in 1989 for hefty dividends and fat executive pay packets.</p>
<p>Many have picked up on indications from Byatt to ensure shareholder rewards are matched by customer price cuts but their image remains dull.</p>
