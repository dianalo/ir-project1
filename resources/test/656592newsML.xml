<p>A jury ended its first day of deliberations on Thursday without reaching a decision on whether Gulf War veteran Timothy McVeigh should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment for blowing up an Oklahoma City federal building.</p>
<p>"We will recess your deliberations now and you should put the matter at rest as best you can and you yourselves rest," federal Judge Richard Matsch said before excusing the jurors for the day.  </p>
<p>Matsch ordered the jury of seven men and five women to resume their deliberations at 8.30 A.M. local time (1430 GMT) on Friday.</p>
<p>The jury deliberated for about four and three-quarter hours after being given the case by Matsch shortly after noon.</p>
<p>The jurors must decide whether McVeigh, a 29-year-old former soldier, should be sentenced to death or life in prison without parole for the April 19, 1995, bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building that killed 168 people.</p>
<p>The jury earlier heard a plea from the prosecution to sentence McVeigh to death and from defence attorneys to spare his life to prevent him from taking any secrets about the bombing to the grave.</p>
