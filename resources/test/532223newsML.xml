<p>Federal anti-terrorism agents have foiled a militia plot to blow up a Texas gas plant with massive loss of life, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>FBI agent Robert Garrity told reporters four men were arrested in a raid on Tuesday evening as they planned a May 1 bomb attack on the Mitchell Energy Company in Wise County, about 30 miles northwest of Fort Worth.</p>
<p>"They had targetted tanks that store hydrogen sulphide, commonly referred to as sour gas, which in appropriate concentrations can be fatal to human beings," Garrity said. "We know they believed that if their plan was successful, they anticipated they might wipe out half of Wise County."</p>
<p>He said the purpose of the plan was to divert police attention so the group could rob an armored car at a bank in the small town of Chico. The proceeds from the heist would be used to finance further terrorist attacks and political activity, he said.</p>
<p>Press reports said the four people arrested, three men and one woman, were part of a group that split off from the Ku Klux Klan, but Garrity and other officials declined to comment on that or whether any other members of the group were still at large.</p>
<p>Garrity said the group had planned to set off a series of staggered explosions at the gas plant in order to kill law enforcement officers responding to the initial blast.</p>
