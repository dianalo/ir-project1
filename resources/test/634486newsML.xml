<p>Bombay blue chips ended modestly higher on Tuesday, on the back of fund buying but a bout of profit-booking wiped gains made in a sharp rally, traders said.</p>
<p>"The market again took its cue from foreign fund buying seen in ITC, Hindustan Lever, Colgate and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra," said a dealer at a foreign brokerage.</p>
<p>An early burst of buying in front-bencher stocks pushed up the index nearly 1.5 percent higher at 3,864.17.</p>
<p>"We obviously saw some short-term buyers stepping in to book profits made out of the market's recent gains," a local dealer said.  </p>
<p>Bombay's benchmark share index has surged 154 points or over four percent in the last four consecutive sessions behind renewed fund buying in blue chips, traders said.</p>
<p>"The market mood has definitely changed after recent fund buying that we have seen," said Ketan Jhaveri, chief deaeler at Kotak Securities, the Indian associate of Goldman Sachs</p>
<p>"We are seeing more participation now, because all this time everybody had been waiting for the market to rally."</p>
<p>But some traders said an impending hike in government-set oil prices, due to be announced on Sunday, kept some funds on the sidelines.  </p>
<p>The steering commitee of the ruling United Front is due to meet on Sunday to take a consensus decision on raising oil prices to tackle a soaring oil pool deficit.</p>
<p>The deficit is the amount owed to oil companies for selling subsidised petroleum products well below global prices.</p>
<p>Shares of India's largest cement maker, ACC ended 35.75 rupees up at 1,116.0. The firm on Tuesday said it would meet on June 18 to consider results for the year ending March 31, 1997.</p>
<p>India on Tuesday also outlined stepping stones the country needed to float the rupee as a fully convertible currency by the year 2,000.</p>
