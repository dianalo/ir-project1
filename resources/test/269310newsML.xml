<p>The Czech crown may weaken in 1997 if interest rates are cut and the current account balance of payments deficit remains poor, analysts say.</p>
<p>The crown proved resilient in 1996, shrugging off domestic political and economic problems to end the year firmly above parity with the mark/dollar basket to which it is pegged each day by the central bank.</p>
<p>Above all, it withstood a near five-fold increase of the current account deficit in the first nine months of the year to more than three billion dollars or around eight percent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>The Czech National Bank, which is normally cautious in its estimates, says the current account deficit could reach seven percent of GDP for full year 1996. And the government has based its budget for next year on a projected 1997 current account deficit of 5.8 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>But many private analysts expect it to be around eight percent by the end of next year.</p>
<p>The crown has been supported by a big interest rate differential with western countries.</p>
<p>But analysts said interest rates could be reduced from their present high levels because economic growth was flagging. This raised the prospect that the crown could be exposed to the full force of the balance of payments weakness.</p>
<p>"The risk of the trade deficit is really growing," said Petr Kulka of Girocredit Banka in Prague.</p>
<p>"What I fear is that if they are going to cut interest rates the Czech crown will really go out of range. What they could do is devalue and cut the interest rates at the same time," he added.</p>
<p>The crown is fixed daily against the mid-point of a basket made up of two thirds marks and one third dollars. The Czech currency can be fixed up to 7.5 percent above or below the mid-point of the basket.</p>
<p>In recent months it has remained around 2.5 to three percent above the mid-point, or around 27.5 crowns to the dollar and 17.5 crowns to the mark.</p>
<p>The Czech National Bank (CNB) tightened monetary policy in a two-pronged attack in the summer to combat inflation which has stuck at between 8.5 and nine percent throughout the year.</p>
<p>At the end of June the CNB raised its key discount rate one full percentage point to 10.5 percent and then raised minimum reserve requirements for commercial banks to 11.5 from 8.5 percent on August 1.</p>
<p>The result has been a dramatic decline in M2 money growth to 9.8 percent year-on-year in October compared with 22.4 percent in the same month in 1995.</p>
<p>However, growth in gross domestic product (GDP) has plunged to just 3.6 percent in the third quarter from 6.3 percent in same period last year.</p>
<p>The direction that official interest rate policy takes, therefore, will depend on the relative importance attached to increasing growth or, alternatively, reducing inflation.</p>
<p>Analysts said the central bank would probably adopt a wait and see policy until mid-year and then cut interest rates if inflation showed signs of coming down.</p>
<p>All analysts polled by Reuters said the second half of the year would be crucial.</p>
<p>Tomas Becvar, a dealer at Komercni Banka, expected the crown to strengthen slightly during the first quarter before attention refocused on the trade deficit bringing the crown back down.</p>
<p>"I think during the first quarter of the year..the Czech crown could appreciate again, then later during the year we expect it slowly to come back to central parity," he said.</p>
<p>"I think the trade deficit still could be a relatively big problem," he added.</p>
<p>In mid-December the Czech Parliament passed a balanced 1997 budget based on growth in GDP of 5.4 percent, average annual inflation of 8.6 percent, and average unemployment of 3.3 percent.</p>
<p>However, many private analysts take a less sanguine view, especially of the prospects for the current account.</p>
