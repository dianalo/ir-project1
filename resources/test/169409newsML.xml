<p>Albania's appeals court has upheld prison sentences of up to 20 years on nine senior former communist officials, the Albanian press reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The nine were jailed for abusing human rights when they ordered thousands of dissidents into internal exile before the demise of the hardline communist government in 1990.</p>
<p>Chief judge Prel Martini was quoted by the daily newspaper Rilindja Demokratike as saying the sentencing could be the reason for an explosion early on Wednesday which wrecked his apartment, injuring four people, including himself and his seven-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>Around 100,000 Albanians are believed to have been forced into exile in remote villages during 45 years of communist rule because of their alleged opposition to the Stalinist government or for trying to escape from the isolated Balkan country.</p>
<p>Three senior ex-communists were sentenced to death in May but an appeals court revoked the sentences and imposed jail terms instead. Thirteen other ex-communists have been sentenced to up to 25 years in jail for crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>No date has yet been set for the trial of former president Ramiz Alia and two former ministers charged with ordering the shooting of Albanians who tried to flee the country.</p>
