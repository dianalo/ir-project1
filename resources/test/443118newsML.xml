<p>Creditanstalt Investment Bank AG (CAIB), a unit of Creditanstalt, said on Friday net profit in 1996 jumped to 197 million schillings from 12 million a year ago.</p>
<p>The result was boosted by the sale of CAIB stakes in Czech privatisation funds, CAIB-board member Wolfgang Lafite told a news conference.</p>
<p>"The sale of our stake in privatisation funds did not have an insignificant impact on the result", Lafite said, but declined to elaborate.</p>
<p>Total earnings almost tripled to 932 million schillings from 354 million in 1995. Income from comission doubled to 625 million schillings, while income from trading soared to 127 million schillings from five million the previous year.</p>
<p>Operating costs increased to 665 million schillings from 260 million.</p>
<p>CAIB said total assets climbed to 2.88 billion schillings from 0.82 billion, mainly due to the start of trading in fixed income instruments in Budapest and Warsaw.</p>
<p>Chief executive Marko Musulin said he expected a lasting positive development in 1997 based on an excellent business performance in the first quarter.</p>
<p>CAIB also plans to reinforce its leading role in investment banking in Eastern Europe by expanding to the Baltic states, Musulin noted, but would not give further details.</p>
<p>"We are driven by our clients and if we are asked to cover new markets we do not back off," he said.</p>
<p>Musulin said Greece and Turkey would also be on the agenda for the firm's expansion drive.</p>
