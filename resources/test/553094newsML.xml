<p>The world's best chess player and its most powerful chess-playing machine resume their historic battle on Saturday, a re-match between brain cell and silicon and a test of humanity's relationship with computers.</p>
<p>In one of the most eagerly anticipated re-matches in history, grandmaster Garry Kasparov and the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue renew the rivalry they began 15 months ago in Philadelphia when Kasparov defeated the machine over six games after a stunning loss in the first.</p>
<p>The key question posed in the contest, scheduled to begin on Saturday and run through May 11, is whether a machine can dominate a human at chess, the game that for centuries has been considered the ultimate expression of rational thought.</p>
<p>There will be lots of emotion on both sides of the board: Kasparov's unrelenting desire to win and the aspirations of the computer scientists who have devoted years of research to creating the hugely powerful calculating machine.</p>
<p>"Right now we are in an age where we are trying to understand our relationship with computers," Joseph Hoane, the Deep Blue team's codewriter, told Reuters. "The computer has shown me things that I could never have known otherwise. It's a tool that helps us think better, that's one of the main reasons why we're here."</p>
<p>Kasparov, only 34 years old and world champion since the age of 22, is considered by most experts to be the best player of the ancient game who has ever lived. He faces a challenger that has twice the calculating speed of last year's program. Of even greater significance, Deep Blue's software has been infused with more knowledge about chess.</p>
<p>IBM hired U.S. grandmaster Joel Benjamin to work full-time with the team of five scientists in preparation for the match. Deep Blue can examine hundreds of millions of positions per second and it now also appreciates strategy and the relative value of pieces in certain positions, according to IBM.</p>
<p>Deep Blue is an IBM RS/6000 SP parallel processor with specialized microchips for chess. Parallel processors make many complex calculations simultaneously, unlike serial processors, which calculate one problem at a time.</p>
<p>Computers have beaten Kasparov and other leading grandmasters in matches with speeded-up games of an hour, 30 minutes or less, but not in classical chess, where games can last as long as six hours. Kasparov's game one defeat in Philadelphia was historic -- the first time a world champion had lost to a computer program in the traditional format.</p>
<p>The burly Russian grandmaster, who has no advance information of Deep Blue's ability, has labeled it an "alien opponent." He says he will accept any combination of wins, draws or losses that produces a winning result and enable him to collect the $700,000 prize. The loser receives $400,000.</p>
<p>"Any win. One win, five draws. That's good, it will do," said Kasparov, who feels the match is important not only to himself and to chess but also to the wider world.</p>
<p>"Mankind is at a stage now where we need some practical results from our computer work and you can only get this specific result in chess," he said while preparing in his Manhattan hotel room days before the match.</p>
<p>Chess-playing is considered ideal for computers because the game involves a specific number of physical objects governed by simple, clearly defined rules. All of those involved in the match have described it as an experiment to help build computers that can make complex, simultaneous calculations at high speeds.</p>
<p>IBM says programs such as Deep Blue's can be used for air traffic control, data mining, weather forecasting and in molecular dynamics for making new medicines. The actual machine -- two 6-foot 5-inch (1.9 metre) tall black modules each containing 16 processors -- resides in a room at IBM's research center. A replica has been installed at the match venue, a skyscraper office complex in Manhattan.</p>
