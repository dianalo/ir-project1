<headline>ABC network news starting to show weakness - WSJ.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>For four of the past five weeks, ABC's World News Tonight with Peter Jennings has lost out to NBC's Nightly News, according to data from Nielsen Media Research, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.</p>
<p>ABC is a unit of Walt Disney Co. NBC is a subsidiary of General Electric Co.</p>
<p>The year-end drop was not enough to knock ABC out of the top spot for all of 1996, but it's the first sign of weakness shown by the newscast that has been television's most dominant news operation since 1989, the story said.</p>
