<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government said on Saturday it planned more economic reform packages in coming months after one on Friday cut several taxes and duties.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz told a news conference that Sharif would announce an agricultural revival package on April 3.</p>
<p>Other programmes expected in the next few months would revamp and cut back state corporations, reform banking and capital markets and promote investment, he said.</p>
<p>Aziz said the basic purpose of the package he unveiled before the National Assembly (lower house of parliament) on Friday was to revive the economy, which he said had seen a slow-down under former prime minister Benazir Bhutto's government.</p>
<p>Though the package had reduced the rates of import tariffs, personal and corporate taxes and a general sales tax, the government expected revenues would increase, he said.</p>
<p>"On the face of it, we have reduced the rates of taxes, but we do not expect much decline in the revenues as a result because of three factors -- revival of economic activity, reduction in smuggling (of foreign goods) and less temptation to evade (taxes)," he said.</p>
<p>"If these three things happen, we hope the impact on our revenues will be positive rather than negative."</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF)  welcomed Friday's package, which Aziz said would form the basis of talks with the IMF for an enhanced structural adjustment loan.</p>
<p>"The successful implementation of the government's reform measures accompanying macro-economic improvements will provide basis for the adoption of multi-year arrangements under the concessional Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and Extended Fund Facility (EFF)," an IMF statement said.</p>
<p>The IMF statement is likely to have a positive impact on Pakistani markets, analysts in Karachi said.</p>
<p>"This is very positive news," Anisur Rehman research head at SocGen-Crosby Securities said.</p>
<p>He said the IMF approval of the package was likely to draw foreign portfolio investors who had gone to the sidelines after the fund suspended a standby loan last week after Pakistan failed to meet agreed targets.</p>
<p>"We have an industry- and export-friendly economic reforms package, the IMF's approval and the start of an India-Pakistan (peace) dialogue," Rehman said. "All these developments combined are likely to provide a very positive environment for foreign investors to make their entry."</p>
<p>Analyst Munir Ladha of AKD Securities said a fall in the stock market on Friday should be seen as a "knee-jerk reaction". He said the index would improve after investors had had a deeper look into the reforms.</p>
<p>The finance minister said he hoped the stock market would respond positively "particularly after a few days".</p>
