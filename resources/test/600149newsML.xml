<headline>JGBs steady by noon after dip on rate hike report.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-05-20</dateline>

<p>JGBs were steady in the cash and futures markets at the Tokyo midday on Tuesday, after briefly falling on a local TV report that the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will recommend to the Prime Minister by the end of May that the official discount rate (ODR) be raised, traders said.</p>
<p>The key June contract dipped to 124.26 in early trade but recovered to 124.53 by midday. It closed at 124.40 on Monday.</p>
<p>The yield of the benchmark 182nd 10-year cash JGB was at 2.460 percent, unchanged from Monday.</p>
<p>An LDP source later said that there had been no decision yet on whether to recommend an ODR hike to the Prime Minister.  </p>
<p>The source admitted, however, that there were calls for an early rate rise within an LDP panel that is due to finalise a report on administrative reform for submission to the Prime Minister as early as the end of this month.</p>
<p>NHK television reported early on Tuesday that the panel will make the recommendation in light of parliamentary passage of a bill to drastically reform Japan's Foreign Exchange and Foreign Trade Control Law. The new law will take effect in April, 1998.</p>
<p>The panel argued that Japan needs to tighten credit to avoid further capital outflows from Japan because the new forex law could accelerate such outflows, NHK said.  </p>
<p>Traders said that JGBs could have fallen more steeply on the rate hike report, but losses were limited by traders' reluctance to build fresh positions ahead of a U.S. policy setting Federal Open Market Committee meeting later today and a planned 10-year JGB auction on Wednesday.</p>
