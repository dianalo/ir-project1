<p>Director Todd Solondz, whose film "Welcome to the Dollhouse," shows life in an American junior high school as a season in Hell by way of New Jersey, swears his film is not strictly autobiographical but admits the story is much like his own.</p>
<p>Unlike Flaubert, the French novelist who upon finishing his acclaimed novel remarked "Madame Bovary -- Cest moi," Solondz says Dawn, the heroine of his film who goes through her 11th year wearing green polyester stretch pants and an expression of pained stoicism, is not really him.</p>
<p>"Nothing in the movie happened to me, but it's as if it had," he told Reuters at a New York coffee shop.</p>
<p>The film shows how heartrending it is to be unpopular in junior high, the cruelty of families and kids and how awful the "wonder years" really are. It won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival in January.</p>
<p>Solondz, 35, who is long and skinny and wears oversize glasses, called the film a "sad comedy" about a time in life not usually taken seriously in American film. "There are very few films which deal realistically with the subject of childhood," he said.</p>
<p>"I could think of some European films that dealt seriously with the subject but I couldn't think of any American films. It seemed pretty fertile terrain. For me, as a writer, it's hard to imagine not wanting to grapple with these issues."</p>
<p>"Welcome to the Dollhouse" is set in suburban New Jersey. Bleak and funny at the same time, it follows the misfortunes of 11-year-old Dawn, who is taunted by her schoolmates, ridiculed by her teachers and ignored by her family, who prefer her little sister, a budding ballerina. She is usually filmed doing pirouettes as Dawn sits nearby looking dour.</p>
<p>Solondz grew up in Livingston, New Jersey, not far from where the movie was shot. He said his own family was wonderful -- not like the one in the movie. But still, he talks knowingly about the pain of adolescence. "I think a certain amount of cruelty is thrown into it at that particular age. I think there's an almost primal aspect to it -- emotions are very raw and there's a certain amount of intensity," he said.</p>
<p>"And as adults, I think we tend to forget and romanticize it, in part because it's comforting to believe that's when it was beautiful and neat and easy. And that's why the images of kids in general tend to be so false."</p>
<p>Ironically, Solondz said he can identify as much with the bully in his film as he can with Dawn. "I think there's a certain kind of emotion -- a certain frustration and pain that he experiences. Dawn discovers she is not the only outcast -- that he is as much an outcast as she. And that's part of the process of growing up -- to learn that the great pain you suffer is something that not only you suffer. It's only in becoming an adult that you realise you are not unique in that way -- that there are others who suffer as well."</p>
<p>Solondz went to Yale, where he was unhappy and discovered movies. Then he went to New York University, where he learned to make them. He spent some time in Hollywood but he does not want to talk about that.</p>
<p>Although he seems a bit Woody Allenesque with his skinny frame, oversize glasses and slightly nasal voice, Solondz said he was really unable, at this stage of his career, to say who has influenced him. "Woody Allen, sure -- I'd love to have been influenced by him."</p>
<p>But Solondz's work seems less about personal neurosis -- a traditional Woody Allen preoccupation -- and more about the cruelty people inflict on one another. "It's not the story of an ugly girl. It's the story of a girl who is called ugly."</p>
<p>His approach to directing has a simplicity. "Basically," he said, "I just try and survive it."</p>
