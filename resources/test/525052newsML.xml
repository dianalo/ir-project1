<p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday let stand a landmark ruling barring sex discrimination in women's college athletics.</p>
<p>It also denied appeals by six members of the Branch Davidian sect convicted for a 1993 shootout with federal agents at the sect headquarters near Waco, Texas.</p>
<p>In the sex-bias case, the court denied an appeal by Brown University of a ruling that it violated a section of the 1972 federal civil rights law by discriminating against women in its intercollegiate athletic programme.</p>
<p>The decision rejecting the appeal without comment or dissent stopped short of setting a nationwide precedent but still represented a major victory for the female athletes who sued the Providence, R.I., school.</p>
<p>The suit was filed after Brown decided in 1991 to change the status of women's gymnastics and volleyball teams to "donor funded" from "university funded." Brown also changed the status of two men's teams, water polo and golf.</p>
<p>Under the cost-cutting measure, the women's teams would have had to raise more than $62,000 annually to survive while the men's teams would have had to raise less than $16,000.</p>
<p>A federal judge and an appeals court ruled that Brown had engaged in sex discrimination.</p>
<p>The appeals court rejected Brown's argument it could offer women fewer athletic participation opportunities than men because females were less interested in taking part in sports.</p>
<p>In appealing to the Supreme Court, Brown argued that it will be required to grant preferential treatment to women athletes and may end up discriminating against male athletes by cutting teams for men.</p>
<p>But attorneys for the women said schools that violate the sex-discrimination law may simply increase the women's programme while leaving the men's athletic programme alone.</p>
<p>In the Waco case, a lethal showdown between the federal government and a fringe group that shook the nation, six followers of cult leader David Koresh were convicted of manslaughter, firearms violations and other offences arising from a gunfight with agents at the Branch Davidian compound.</p>
<p>The charges stemmed from a February 28, 1992 raid by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which led to a shootout that killed four agents and wounded more than 20. Three cult members also were killed in the confrontation.</p>
<p>A 51-day standoff followed and ended on April 19, 1993, when FBI agents mounted an armoured tear-gas assault. A fire engulfed the compound, killing Koresh and about 80 followers.</p>
<p>The government alleged Koresh's followers set the fire, while surviving cult members said it began when tanks knocked over lanterns as they demolished walls to insert the tear gas.</p>
<p>In other action on Monday, the Supreme Court:</p>
<p>-rejected an appeal by ABC of a $1 million-plus libel award for a 1992 news broadcast stating that a company's garbage recycling machine "does not work";</p>
<p>-unanimously overturned a ruling that allowed parents in Arizona to sue the state for failing to provide child support collection services as required by the Social Security law;</p>
<p>-rejected an Internal Revenue Service appeal in a dispute with Texaco Inc over what the IRS calculated to be more than $1 billion in taxes on Saudi Arabian oil from 1979-81.</p>
