<p>Neither the European Commission nor the European Parliament know whether to call for a ban on the cloning of animals, it emerged from a debate at the European Parliament on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Reacting to the successful cloning of a sheep, named Dolly, at Scotland's Roslin Institute, Research Commissioner Edith Cresson and Euro-MPs from across the political spectrum ruled out taking the technique further and cloning human beings.</p>
<p>But the cloning of animals provoked more inconclusive soul-searching.</p>
<p>Cresson, a former French socialist prime minister, told Euro-MPs the experiment which produced Dolly raised many ethical concerns.</p>
<p>She said the most obvious danger was the temptation to use the technique, which creates genetically identical individuals by splitting embryos or by transferring the nucleus of one cell into an egg, to clone humans.</p>
<p>Widespread cloning could also narrow the genetic diversity of livestock, Cresson warned.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, we should not underestimate the potential benefits of such a discovery, notably for human health," she continued.</p>
<p>Advocates of animal cloning also point to other advantages, such as the possibility of producing sheep which are entirely free from scrapie, a disease similar to mad cow disease.</p>
<p>"There are ethical problems in using the technique. There are ethical problems in not using the techniques as well," said Ken Collins, the chairman of the parliament's environment committee.</p>
<p>Cresson said the Commission had asked its biotechnology ethics committee, an independent advisory body, to report back on the implications of the Roslin cloning success by May.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the parliament is expected on Wednesday to pass a resolution demanding an immediate global ban on human cloning but just a moratorium on animal cloning.</p>
<p>Euro-MPs want the Commission to play a leading role in pushing for a worldwide ban on human cloning, namely by convincing Japan and the United States -- the EU's main competitors in the field of biotechnology.</p>
<p>"We cannot assume that because we have something under control in the European Union, that it is universally under control. It isn't," Collins warned.</p>
<p>But Cresson said this would be difficult unless the EU member states agreed on a common stance on cloning.</p>
<p>Not all member states ban research into cloning or have a national ethics committee to judge the issue, she pointed out.</p>
<p>Collins, a British Socialist, criticised some Euro-MPs for becoming hysterical.</p>
<p>Before they raised the spectre of a 'Brave New World' devoid of natural selection and free choice, where only those of the approved mental and physical type were allowed to breed, they should go and read Aldous Huxley's classic novel properly.</p>
<p>"The point about 'Brave New World' is it's the brainwashing that mattered not the cloning," Collins stressed.</p>
<p>As for concerns about animal welfare, he said Dolly was "probably a rather happier sheep" than most Euro-MPs.</p>
