<p>President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday cautiously welcomed the preliminary results of presidential elections in breakaway Chechnya, which pointed to victory for moderate candidate Aslan Maskhadov.</p>
<p>But other senior Russian politicians warned that Maskhadov's likely win in Monday's poll did not mean an end to disagreements between Moscow and Chechnya over the oil-rich region's future.</p>
<p>"The preliminary results of the voting, in the president's opinion, give a serious chance for productive negotiations to continue between the federal government and the new Chechen leadership," press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.</p>
<p>But he made clear that the Kremlin still ruled out granting full independence to Chechnya, where Russian troops unsuccessfully waged a 21-month military campaign to crush pro-independence rebels.</p>
<p>"The result (of future negotiations) will be the mutually acceptable resolution of all questions defining the status of the Chechen republic within the Russian Federation," said Yastrzhembsky.</p>
<p>A peace deal signed last August defers Chechnya's final political status for five years, but Maskhadov, like all his main rivals in the presidential race, insists his Caucasian region is already a fully independent state.</p>
<p>Chechnya topped the agenda when Yeltsin, recovering from a bout of pneumonia, paid a working visit to the Kremlin on Tuesday for talks with Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and other officials.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin later chaired a meeting also attended by heads of both parliamentary chambers, Yeltsin's chief of staff and the secretary of his policy-making Security Council to coordinate Russia's strategy on Chechnya.</p>
<p>The latest partial poll returns showed that Maskhadov, who signed the peace deal with Moscow last August, was easily leading the field. The former Soviet artillery commander, 45, has already claimed victory.</p>
<p>Much to Moscow's relief, hardline rebel Shamil Basayev seemed set to come a distant second in the race. A hero in Chechnya, Basayev is loathed in the Kremlin for leading a spectacular raid on the Russian town of Budennovsk in 1995 in which more than 100 people died.</p>
<p>But Russian politicians strongly opposed to Chechen independence sounded a note of warning.</p>
<p>"One should not forget that all candidates pledged on the Koran to fight for Chechnya's independence," Interfax quoted Anatoly Chekhoyev, a senior member of the influential Communist faction in the State Duma lower house of parliament, as saying.</p>
<p>Ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said he was pessimistic about future negotiations and the new Chechen president would have little room for maneouvre, given the high hopes that the election campaign had aroused.</p>
<p>"The federal authorities will not find a common language with any of the Chechen candidates," Interfax quoted Zhirinovsky as saying during a visit to the French city of Strasbourg.</p>
<p>"Maskhadov will simply be shot dead (by his fellow separatists)...if he dares to step back from his demands for independence," he added.</p>
<p>But other politicians said Chechnya's devastated economy would force any new leader towards compromise.</p>
<p>"Maskhadov is a practical and pragmatic politician," Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov told reporters.</p>
<p>"Separatism is separatism but any leader has to provide the population with food, clothes, medical assistance," he said. "Without Russia Chechnya has no chances to improve."</p>
