<p>The president of the European Parliament on Wednesday rebuked Israel over plans to expand Jewish settlements in the West Bank and called for implementing Israeli-PLO self-rule deals "to the letter".</p>
<p>In his first address to the Palestinian Legislative Council, Klaus Hansch also told lawmakers he looks forward to the signing of an association agreement between the Palestinian Authority and the European Union.</p>
<p>"Let me state clearly: new settlements are illegal and there must be no expansion," he said. "Bulldozers do not pave the way for peace."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government in August lifted a settlement freeze imposed by the previous Labour-led government and has since disclosed plans to build thousands of new housing units.</p>
<p>In the most recent announcement, an Israeli official on Tuesday said that Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai approved plans to build 1,200 apartments in Emmanuel, near the PLO-ruled West Bank city of Nablus.</p>
<p>The plans also include the construction of a country club, a senior citizens' home, a field school and a study centre for ultra-orthodox Jews.</p>
<p>Palestinians view the settlements as obstacles to their goal of creating an independent state in the West Bank and Gaza, occupied by Israel since the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Hansch said the European Parliament also favours the signing of a trade cooperation agreement being negotiated with the Palestinian Authority that would help boost Palestinian exports to Europe.</p>
<p>"The European Parliament welcomes the trade and cooperation agreement already under negotiation between the Union and the Palestinian Authority," Hansch told the 88-member council in the West Bank town of Ramallah.</p>
<p>"And we look forward to the day when it becomes an association agreement," he said.</p>
<p>The agreement would include the Palestinian Authority in the so-called Euromed accord, which governs the 15-nation European Union's relations with Mediterranean partners. The agreement could be finalised by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>The EU signed an association agreement with Israel earlier this year.</p>
<p>The European Union, the largest donor to Palestinian self-rule areas, is seeking a more prominent role in peacemaking alongside the United States.</p>
<p>In October, French President Jacques Chirac became the first foreign head of state to address the Palestinian Legislative Council.</p>
