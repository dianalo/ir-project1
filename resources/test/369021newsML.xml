<p>Support for a negotiated end to Zaire's civil war is growing in the capital Kinshasa with at least one supporter of President Mobutu Sese Seko joining opposition radicals in calling for talks with rebels.</p>
<p>"We have to achieve a genuine national reconciliation if we want Zaire to take off economically. If we do not negotiate with Laurent Kabila, things will not fall back in place," politician, businessman and Mobutu associate Bemba Saolona told Reuters.</p>
<p>He was speaking one day after the main opposition Sacred Union of the Radical Opposition (USOR) of Etienne Tshisekedi closed down much of the capital with a strike call to back demands for the departure of Prime Minister Kengo wa Dondo.</p>
<p>Kengo and his government have staked their reputation on a military solution to the war, which began when Kabila and his Tutsi-led rebels took up arms in October accusing the Zairean authorities of denying them citizenship.</p>
<p>"The goal for which Kabila and ourselves are fighting it's just the same, which, as you know very well, is the total eradication of the dictatorship regime of Mr Mobutu," Tshisekedi spokesman Martin Tshibangu told the British Broadcasting Corporation on Monday.</p>
<p>"By calling the strike, it's a way of telling Mr Mobutu the time has come to negotiate," he said. "What Mr Kabila is doing is to force him to go to sit around the table of negotiation."</p>
<p>Mobutu, who had prostate surgery in Europe in August, returned home and reshuffled the government and army leadership.</p>
<p>Zaire's army launched a much-touted counter-offensive on January 20. The rebels, who hold towns and territory along Zaire's eastern border with Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, hit back by attacking on several fronts.</p>
<p>Zaire accuses its neighbours of invading to help the rebels, who have given Mobutu until February 21 to negotiate.</p>
<p>News from the battle front suggests the rebels have been pushing south into Zaire's mineral-rich Shaba province and west. Officials in Kinshasa had nothing fresh to report on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Saolona, a member of Zaire's transitional parliament, played down demands by Kabila that Mobutu, who seized power in 1965 and plans to run for president this year, should stand down. "Kabila is not to be taken in earnest when he says the president must relinquish power. He is only raising the stakes," he says.</p>
<p>Antoine Abouloukwa, who returned from years of exile in Germany last year and plans to run for the presidency, once backed the military option. He has since changed tack.</p>
<p>"Zaire has to negotiate... It's a matter of realism. We have to admit the rebels are stronger than we are. The thing is to spare human lives. Dialogue is now the only way out of the war," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Zairean military officials acknowledge the counter-offensive may not have got into top gear but promise fresh attacks.</p>
<p>Joseph Olenghankoy, one of Tshisekedi's staunchest allies, says the main opposition plans to send a delegation for direct talks with Kabila. "We are still considering the matter... Our conviction is that negotiation is the sole way out of the devastating war. We have to avoid any further bloodbath."</p>
<p>Some newspapers have taken up the call.</p>
<p>"The political forces who wield power cannot pretend they do not know with whom to negotiate a way out of the crisis," the opposition daily Le Palmares said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We should be moving towards high level negotiations but the question is with whom," Le Phare said.</p>
<p>The government has expressed interest in regional talks on a settlement -- but has made its participation conditional on the withdrawal of foreign forces from its territory.</p>
