<p>Iran hopes to award the first of ten oil and gas projects open to bids from international firms within the next three months, Deputy Oil Minister Mohammed Hadi Nejad Hosseinian said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Within the next three months we will finalise two or three of them," Hosseinian told reporters at a conference organised by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).</p>
<p>"At least five or six" would be awarded by the time of the next Iranian election in mid-1997, he added.</p>
<p>First projects likely to be awarded under a "buy-back" scheme would include the huge South Pars gas field, redevelopment of the war-damaged 60,000 barrel a day (bpd) Soroush oilfield in the Gulf near Kharg Island and the 35,000 bpd Balal oilfield near Lavan.</p>
<p>Also likely to be among first awards were two NGL projects, Hosseinian said.</p>
<p>State-owned National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) in August 1995 issued a tender to international firms for development of 10 major oil and gas projects.</p>
<p>NIOC's open-door policy was launched just prior to the tender when it signed a ground-breaking $600 million deal with French firm Total SA to develop the Sirri A and E oil and gas fields.</p>
<p>But United States sanctions on Tehran, aimed at denying finances for what Washington alleges fund international terrorism and culminating in August's Iran-Libya Sanctions Act, have delayed the award of more projects.</p>
<p>Hosseinian said European Union protests against the U.S. legislation, which is designed to punish companies dealing with Tehran, had helped smooth negotiations.</p>
<p>The EU said the law imposing secondary sanctions on non-U.S. companies could damage world trade.</p>
<p>"The political environment for doing these projects is now better than before," he said.</p>
<p>"We're taking a low profile, we're doing no publicity," he added.</p>
