<p>Singapore Refining Co (SRC) restarted its 60,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) crude unit on Monday following an unscheduled one-week shutdown, a company spokeswoman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The crude unit was brought down on October 1 as "part of SRC's optimisation programme to make sure that all refining units are performing to achieve maximum output," the company said in a statement on September 27.  </p>
<p>At that time, SRC chief executive officer JJ Rinck said, "during the period of shutdown, stock inventories of products will be maintained at levels to enable the refinery to meet the needs of our three shareholders."</p>
<p>SRC is 40 percent owned by Singapore Petroleum Co, with the remaining stakes divided equally between British Petroleum and Caltex-a joint venture between Texaco Inc and Chevron Corp.</p>
<p>Its total refining capacity is 285,000 bpd.</p>
