<p>Gunmen released unharmed on Monday a Somali doctor who was working for the aid agency CARE International in northern Mogadishu, the agency said.</p>
<p>CARE spokeswoman Wendy Driscoll said Saed Aden Mohamed Firdis was freed unharmed and no ransom was demanded or paid. He was seized on Friday outside his north Mogadishu home.</p>
<p>CARE officials had said the abduction of Firdis was a clan issue as he was from one clan and lived in another clan area.</p>
<p>Somalia has had no central government since late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted in 1991 and foreign aid agencies demand protection from gunmen who kidnap foreign aid workers for ransom.</p>
