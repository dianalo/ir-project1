<headline>LME ends mixed after copper's "white-knuckle" ride.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-03-07</dateline>

<p>Copper prices veered away alarmingly during late Friday LME trading, as the market lost all the gains racked up earlier and pulled most other metals back.</p>
<p>Traders said copper came under heavy pressure from liquidation and end-week sales after a midsession upside break was not sustained. Once the buying interest seen then, which was speculative in origin, faded, the market fell back swiftly.</p>
<p>"It has been a funny old day - and there has been no news whatsoever. The best thing you can say about copper is when it looks good you sell it, and when it looks bad you buy it," one said.</p>
<p>From a fresh nine-month high of $2,445 a tonne, the market tumbled back to close Friday's kerb at $2,390, a $13 loss from yesterday.</p>
<p>Traders said today's action represents a false technical break-out, and the marlet remains broadly in a $2,350/2,420 band.</p>
<p>Most traders remain bullish, however, given continued stock falls - LME inventories dropped 6,225 tonnes on Friday.</p>
<p>Also, the spreads are tightening up again, with cash/threes reaching a $90 backwardation on covering before being indicated at $78/88, against Thursday's $70.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, sentiment was pulled around by copper's volatility, with aluminium largely following the red metal.</p>
<p>A further heightening in the Trans-World/Russian spat over foreign involvement in Russia's domestic industry did not influence the market unduly.</p>
<p>"I would not buy or sell aluminium on the back of Trans-World and Russia's arguments. At the end of the day Russia will still produce it," the trader said.</p>
<p>After grinding to a halt near the $1,700 level price sagged to finish the kerb at $1,675, down $14.</p>
<p>Zinc came back from the fresh 4-1/2 year highs of $1,266 in late trading, but remained firmer and set for further gains.</p>
<p>The 1,150-tonne inventory decline proved to be a temporary depressant, with physical enquiries healthy and the contango shrinking, they said.</p>
<p>By the close three months was back at $1,254, up $12, while cash/threes was at a $9 contango, against $13/14 yesterday.</p>
<p>Nickel movements were volatile throughout the session, matching the whippy copper market.</p>
<p>Thus, prices peaked in early afternoon, before re-tracing towards the end of the session to close at $8,130, down $20 from Thursday.</p>
<p>Lead trading was fairly unexciting for most of the session, with the market holding in a tight, albeit steadier range. The market finished at $686, up $3.</p>
<p>Tin was generally supported on price dips, but was unable to make much upside progress when copper came back from its highs. Prices closed just $10 higher at $5,920.</p>
<p>Alloy was marked down with primary, and finished a slightly softer $1,550/55 a tonne.</p>
