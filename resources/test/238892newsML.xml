<p>A drop in Japan's trade surplus in the first 20 days of November was mainly due to higher crude oil prices during that period which boosted the value of overall imports, a senior Finance Ministry official told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>Earlier, the ministry said Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus for the first 20 days of November dropped 45.9 percent from a year earlier to 171.27 billion yen. Imports rose 17.4 percent year-on-year, while exports increased 8.4 percent.  </p>
<p>The official also said the imports were concentrated in the second 10 days of November after imports dropped in the first 10 days of the month.</p>
<p>The 8.4 percent rise in exports could be described as a "normal rise" for the first 20 days of a month, he added.</p>
