<p>Shares of U.S. Robotics Corp jumped on Friday. Analysts said America Online Inc's plan to increase spending on network upgrades meant money in the till for the modem maker.</p>
<p>"AOL's network problems are an opportunity for Robotics, there's no question about that," Steven Levy, an analyst for Oppenheimer &amp; Co, told Reuters.</p>
<p>On Thursday AOL said it would spend $350 million to upgrade its network instead of the $250 million previously planned.  </p>
<p>The online service has been plagued by outages and network overload, and at least four resulting lawsuits have been filed against the company on behalf of subscribers.</p>
<p>U.S. Robotics is one of the principal suppliers of modems and systems hubs to America Online.</p>
<p>"The incremental revenues to U.S. Robotics from this network expansion are likely to (be) measured in the tens of millions of dollars," Levy wrote in a research report.</p>
<p>Shares of U.S. Robotics were up three to 70-1/8.  </p>
<p>U.S. Robotics today said John McCartney had been named president to run the day-to-day operations of the company. He succeeds Casey Cowell, who will continue as chairman and chief executive and focus on long-term technical strategies.</p>
<p>Analysts said the changes amounted to switching titles, as McCartney already served as chief operating officer and will keep that role as well. But they were quick to praise McCartney's skills.</p>
<p>"John is outstanding and certainly helped build a formidable company," said Amar Senan, an analyst for Volpe, Welty &amp; Co. "He's a tough businessman...They're very focused on the market and they're very smart competitors."</p>
