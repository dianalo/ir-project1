<p>Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan called for snap elections to resolve a row between his Islamist-led coalition and Turkey's secularist generals, but the way forward was not immediately clear.</p>
<p>No date was set for polling and there were no guarantees that a complicated handover of power would not go awry and give the opposition a chance to set up its own secularist government.</p>
<p>Erbakan, the first Islamist to head the government of modern Turkey, committed himself to stepping down in favour of coalition ally Tansu Ciller, a secular conservative, within a month as part of a deal to go for early elections.</p>
<p>"The election can be held in a short time by updating the electoral roll. I don't think there will be a need for a long process," he said.</p>
<p>Erbakan must first give his resignation to President Suleyman Demirel, a veteran of the volatile political scene in Turkey, a secular state with an overwhelmingly Moslem population.</p>
<p>According to political tradition, Demirel, an avowed secularist, should nominate the party leader with the most members of parliament to produce a feasible cabinet list.</p>
<p>Erbakan, whose Islam-based Welfare Party has 159 deputies, is likely to get the task and choose a cabinet with Ciller as prime minister to steer the country into elections.</p>
<p>But in practice any government headed by Ciller, whose reputation has been damaged by corruption allegations, would face a major obstacle in trying to survive a vote of confidence within days of taking over.</p>
<p>The present coalition government, battered by anti-Islamist defections, lost its absolute majority last week and now has 275 deputies in the 550-seat chamber.</p>
<p>Ciller should be sure of the Welfare Party votes but a current effort to recruit seven far-right deputies to her side could easily be cancelled out by further defections to the opposition from her True Path Party.</p>
<p>Similarly, an election law to fix the poll date could run into trouble in the national assembly without the support of the opposition. Many deputies from all parties are reluctant to see fresh polls in case they lose their parliamentary privileges.</p>
<p>It was also unclear which parties might profit fron elections. The Welfare Party is widely believed to have increased its share of the vote since it polled 21 percent in general elections at the end of 1995, but few reliable opinion polls have been published recently.</p>
<p>Press reports say Erbakan wants a quick poll but Ciller, a U.S.-trained economist, is holding out for a date next year. Elections would not normally be due until the year 2000.</p>
<p>The Welfare Party itself stands accused of threatening Turkey's secular system and could be closed down if it loses the case in the constitutional courts in about six months time.</p>
<p>The case was part of an assault on the Islamists by the secularist elite. The army, which has staged three coups since 1960, declared last month that its struggle against Islamists was a matter of "life or death" for Turkey, a member of NATO.</p>
<p>Secularist pressure diverted Erbakan from his aim of increasing the role of Islam in public life at home and improving relations with Turkey's Moslem neighbours.</p>
