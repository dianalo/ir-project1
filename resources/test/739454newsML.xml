<title>BELGIUM: Belgian bonds to miss a lot during Monday holiday.</title>
<headline>Belgian bonds to miss a lot during Monday holiday.</headline>
<dateline>BRUSSELS 1997-07-18</dateline>

<p>Belgian linear bonds drifted quietly in pre-holiday mode on Friday, although traders said activity picked up late in the day with German and French banks joining in the general selling of the shorter maturities.</p>
<p>They said the outlook would be heavily influenced by the presentation of the French budget audit and a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, both of which take place on Monday when Belgium is closed for National Day.</p>
<p>"We are missing a lot on Monday," one trader said, noting that the market was poised to go in either direction with Bund resistance in sight and people preparing to take profits.  </p>
<p>Traders said the day's activity in Belgium was even more focussed on the shorter maturities at the expense of longer paper than it has been in recent days, with money market rates remaining strong.</p>
<p>"The short end, two to five years, was heavily sold," one trader noted.</p>
<p>The market has been holding up well despite recent releases of strong German and U.S. data, but it is starting to look toppish, according to some traders.</p>
<p>"We are owed a good correction," Conrad Fieremans at Kredietbank said earlier in the day.  </p>
<p>Pressure for a downmove is expected to build up as evidence grows of a slow but steady, export-driven uptrend in Europe's economy, helped by the dollar's rise, particularly on currencies in the mark bloc, analysts said. Germany's IFO institute reported on Friday a rise in business confidence in June.</p>
<p>Some said there was also a downside risk to Monday's presentation of France's budget audit. "How the government will cut the budget deficit to 3.2 to 3.3 percent without introducing an austerity plan beats me," one said.</p>
<p>Speculation centres on new corporate taxes rather than unpopular spending cuts.  </p>
<p>"There has been lots of talk the outcome of the audit will disappoint," said Fieremans. The actual news might, as a result, spark some buying, but mainly of French paper.</p>
<p>Paris government sources have said the audit would show the deficit at around 3.5 to 3.6 percent of gross domestic product, well above the three percent norm set out in the Maastricht Treaty on Europe's 1999 single currency project.</p>
<p>Fieremans said France too would benefit from a pick-up in European growth, which would help it cut the deficit.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Belgian franc remained under pressure against the mark and money market rates stayed firm.  </p>
<p>In defense of the franc the National Bank has been keeping money supply tight.</p>
<p>On Friday it cut its allocation on its fixed-rate tender for seven-day advances by a third to 10.025 billion francs.</p>
<p>One-week repos were at 3.77/82 percent, well above the 3.00 percent interest rate on the seven-day advances.</p>
<p>One analyst said the squeeze in the money market was beginning to affect funding conditions in the wider OLO market too.</p>
<p>The benchmark 10-year OLO ended Friday yielding 5.65 percent against Thursday's closing 5.63.</p>
