<p>China's airlines will inevitably increase the number of freighters they operate and start developing a domestic air cargo network in the near future, according to American Airlines' China vice-president, Matthew Chen.</p>
<p>Beijing-based Chen, a former China aviation executive with Boeing, said China was on the brink of a major step in the evolution of its aviation industry and the potential of the air cargo market is "huge".</p>
<p>There are now just two freighters in the whole of China -- Air China has one Boeing 747F plus a fleet of Combis and China Eastern has one MD-11 freighter, he said.</p>
<p>"It is inevitable there will be more freighters to cover the domestic market," added Chen.</p>
<p>He felt it would not take very long before a current Chinese airline launched a cargo service or a new airline started up, and that either development would not surprise him.</p>
<p>In term of airfreight operations, China had been slow to catch on but there was huge potential, he said.</p>
<p>"China is market-driven and cargo airlines will happen when the market demands it. Up to now the market has not been driving that way. But with the Chinese economy growing the way it is, there will be demand to transport high value items by air," Chen said.</p>
<p>He also forecast a limited reduction in the number of small, local Chinese airlines which were now struggling to survive.</p>
<p>The surviving carriers would benefit from older managers of the Cultural Revolution era being replaced by "young turks" open to new ideas, modern management techniques and new technology such as yield management systems, he added.</p>
