<headline>UK's SFA says time needed for regulatory reform.</headline>

<p>Reform of Britain's financial regulatory framework should not be done too hastily, but with sufficient time to study the full implications of any changes, a City watchdog official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Richard Farrant, chief executive of the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), said, "If there is going to be reform, then we should look at it from the bottom up... I don't think it is urgently needed."</p>
<p>Farrant told the House of Commons Treasury Committee that, given the pace of business in the London market, he thought it would take five to 10 years to analyse reform proposals.  </p>
<p>The SFA has come under fire over the collapse of British merchant bank Barings in 1995 after Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson ran up almost $1.4 billion of losses. Barings was rescued by Dutch financial giant ING.</p>
<p>The SFA, which took disciplinary action against nine individuals, was seen as being too soft on the two men at the top of the bank after ruling that chairman Peter Baring and his deputy Andrew Tuckey were not responsible for the collapse.</p>
<p>Instead it sought "assurances" from them that they would not seek top management jobs in financial firms again.  </p>
<p>Last month, the SFA reacted to the criticism, publishing proposals aimed at making easier the identification of those responsible when a company suffers catastrophic failure.</p>
<p>Under the new proposals, the burden of proof falls on senior management rather than the regulator.</p>
<p>But the opposition Labour Party has said it intends to streamline the regulatory bodies in London if it wins the next election, giving the Securities and Investments Board (SIB) greater responsibility, particularly for regulation.</p>
<p>Currently Britain's regulatory framework includes the SFA, the SIB, investment watchdog IMRO (the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation) and the Serious Fraud Office, as well as the Bank of England.</p>
<p>The House of Commons Treasury Committee hearing on Thursday was part of an inquiry into the Barings collapse and the implications for international regulation.</p>
<p>SFA Chairman, Nicholas Durlacher, said in a written report that the SFA had continued to work on extending supervision and had made efforts to build personal links with foreign regulators in order to improve international regulatory coverage. -- London newsroom +44 171 542 7768</p>
