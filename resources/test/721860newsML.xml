<p>South African shares put a quiet end to a topsy-turvy week on Friday as they finished a healthy trading session with their heads just above opening levels, dealers said.</p>
<p>Golds provided the most impressive gains as the bullion price continued to stabilise around the $319 an ounce level, but dealers warned volumes had been thin and the sector was still a high risk investment arena.</p>
<p>Positive sentiment on the prospect for interest rate cuts later in the year and the relatively painless July 1 relaxation of exchange controls underpinned the local industrials sector.</p>
<p>For investors looking abroad for influences, a healthy opening rise on Wall Street also provided a late kicker that ensured the day ended in positive territory.</p>
<p>The golds index added 17.4 points, or 1.84 percent, to 964.8, while the all-share index gained 10.1 points to 7,348.0 and industrials put on 8.1 points to 8,806.6.</p>
<p>"It was quiet a good day, but there were no fireworks," one dealer said.  </p>
<p>Volumes were high with about 990 million rands worth of trade taking place, but dealers said values had been boosted by several individual stocks that had attracted the lion's share of market attention.</p>
<p>Insurer Liberty Life finished a hectic week of roadshow inspired-buying by adding 25 cents to 140.00 rand in trade worth 108 million rand.</p>
<p>Furniture firm Ellerine was also busy on follow through trade after three large Barings deals on Thursday. More than 1.76 million shares traded worth 62.5 million rand as the stock rose 60 cents to 35.85 rand.</p>
<p>Electronics firm Mustek saw volumes boosted by a 2.5 million bookover deal and industrial holding firm Premier saw a 975,000 share bookover. Mustek, which late last month said that unspecified talks it had been having had ended, dropped 20 cents to 14.50 rand and Premier was up eight cents to 716 cents.</p>
<p>In mining shares Gencor was busy with more than 2.9 million shares trading, valued at about 57.4 million rand, and the share gained 20 cents to 19.70 rand.</p>
<p>Northam Platinum Ltd bounced off a 1997 low after it announced on Thursday that it had reduced its losses in the second quarter of the year. Northam, which also announced a wages deal with the National Union of Mineworkers after the market closed, gained 18 cents to 208 cents.</p>
<p>Overall 174 shares posted gains, against 172 that dropped.</p>
<p>Portfolio managers and dealers said the market was likely to continue firm next week, but that golds were still sensitive to bullion movements and any renewed downwards slide could upset the broader market.</p>
<p>In the futures market near-dated contracts started firm, but backtracked in the afternoon and came off their day highs.</p>
<p>The September golds contract was last at 671/77 from 666 as the all-share index was at 6,677/90 from 6,693. The industrials contract was at 8,525/34 from 8,519.</p>
