<p>The Australian government's Construction Forecasting Committee on Tuesday predicted seven percent real growth in non-residential construction in the fiscal year to June 1997, compared with 11 percent in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Non-residential construction would grow five percent in each of the following two years, the committee said in its Medium Term Prospects report.  </p>
<p>Non-residential construction is divided into engineering construction, such as bridges, and non-residential building, such as supermarkets or offices.</p>
<p>The committee forecast five percent growth in building and eight percent growth in engineering construction in 1996/97.</p>
<p>These year-average forecasts compare the value of activity in one year with the value in the previous year.</p>
<p>"During the past year the non-residential building sector recorded significant growth in shop, hotel and other-business and entertainment categories," the committee said.  </p>
<p>This had outweighed weakness in health and education building, it said.</p>
<p>"Further growth is expected in hotel, other-business, factory, entertainment and miscellaneous building.</p>
<p>"The rate of shop building is expected to peak in the year ahead with a probable decrease in the following year, while office building activity is expected to record an overall rise over the next three years."</p>
<p>The committee, drawing together private and government experts, expected mining to maintain engineering construction in 1996/97.  </p>
<p>"A number of large privately funded infrastructure projects and continued growth in telecommunications are expected to add to significant growth for private engineering construction over the forecast period."</p>
