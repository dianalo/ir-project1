<p>Stone Energy Corp said Monday it acquired a 50 percent working interest with a 41 percent net revenue interest in the Vermilion Block 131 Field for $5.1 million.</p>
<p>At the date of acquisition, daily production from the field six producing wells was about 9.6 million cubic feet of gas, the company said.</p>
<p>It said a new evaluation of the property is in progress using recently acquired 3-D seismic data.</p>
<p>Stone Energy said its first development operations for the property are planned for 1997.  </p>
<p>It said spending totaling $8.6 million have been budgeted for the drilling of three new wells and the recompletion of four existing wells.</p>
<p>In addition to the purchase price, a letter of credit in the amount of $1.8 million was established to secure the unnamed major oil company's obligation to abandon the property, Stone Energy said.</p>
<p>It acquired the operating rights for the property, and the remaining 50 percent interest is owned by another major oil company. The effective date of the purchase is August 1, 1996, and the acquisition includes interests in six producing wells and six shut-in wells.</p>
<p>Vermilion Block 131 is located about 30 miles offshore Louisiana in water depth of 60 feet. The field was discovered in 1960, placed on production in 1963, and its development has resulted in 19 productive wells and seven dry holes. A total of 65 commercial completions have been established in 27 sandstone reservoirs between 4,800 and 14,300 feet, and cumulative production from the property is 482 billion cubic feet of gas and 8.5 million barrels of oil.</p>
