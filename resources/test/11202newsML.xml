<p>Ecuador's President Abdala Bucaram has announced he will hold regular lunches in his presidential palace for members of the country's different ethnic groups as of next week.</p>
<p>"It was about time for the Indians, the blacks and the mixed-bloods to begin eating in the palace with their president because this is not a palace exclusively for the potentates and ambassadors and protocol," Bucaram said late on Thursday.</p>
<p>"In these weekly lunches we are going to get to know the problems of the Indian, mixed-race, black and peasant sectors," he said.</p>
<p>He has invited 35 Indian leaders to lunch next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bucaram, who was elected on a populist platform last month, also plans to create a ministry for ethnic cultures. The Andean nation's population of 11.4 million is 47 percent indigenous.</p>
