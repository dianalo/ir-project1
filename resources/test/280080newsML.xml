<p>Europe heads for the New Year huddled against a continent-wide cold snap which has killed at least 70 in the past week, brought road chaos and air traffic delays and even caused Italy's Venice lagoon to freeze over.</p>
<p>In Russia, up to 300 people have been trapped for days in a tunnel with their vehicles by avalanches in the southerly Caucasus mountains.</p>
<p>Press reports said two women had given birth while in the tunnel and one new-born baby had died of the cold.</p>
<p>While some countries enjoyed slightly milder temperatures on Monday, forecasters across the continent predicted the relief would be shortlived, with heavy snowfalls and more deep freeze expectable through the week.</p>
<p>Bulgaria saw the worst of the cold-related deaths, with nine people found frozen in snow storms on Sunday, bringing the toll there to 19 since Christmas Eve. In the northern mountains 23 villages were without power.</p>
<p>Poland reported its coldest weather for 10 years, with 17 deaths recorded in the past week.</p>
<p>Scandinavia and Russia, well used to hard winters, have seen colder weather and heavier snow than in recent years. Tass news agency reported a total of 10 people dead in Russia with 245 hospitalised with frostbite.</p>
<p>The harsh conditions extended as far south as the Valencia region, near Spain's Mediterranean coast, where a 54-year-old man was found dead from the cold in a makeshift shack at the weekend.</p>
<p>In Italy's Alpine north, temperatures were down to minus 30 degrees Celcius (minus 22 Fahrenheit), although tempered by bright sunshine.</p>
<p>On the northeast coast, the lagoon on which the historic city of Venice is built froze over and the Adriatic resorts of Rimini and Ancona saw snow for the first time in years.</p>
<p>Snow and ice also paralysed much of central and southern Italy, with people using skis to get around the Umbrian capital of Perugia and the normally mild southerly regions of Calabria and Puglia also snow-bound.</p>
<p>Roads, including the main motorway north from Rome, were blocked by snow and flights from the capital's Fiumicino airport were delayed by freezing rain and snow.</p>
<p>Some 40 flights had to be cancelled on Monday morning from Frankfurt airport in Germany, one of Europe's busiest, because of snow on the runways.</p>
<p>Ice also brought shipping to a halt on the Elbe river in eastern Germany, on the Main-Danube canal and on the Danube itself up to Germany's border with Austria.</p>
<p>Hungary saw temperatures equal 76-year-old record lows of minus 29C (minus 20F), compared to the normal mid-winter average of  minus 3C (26F).</p>
<p>Five people -- homeless or drunk -- were reported dead from the cold. Ferry sailings on the Danube were suspended and meteorological officials said shipping on the river could be halted altogether by ice in about four days if temperatures remained low.</p>
<p>A drunken teenage couple in Austria had better luck. They were found comatose in the snow by a Red Cross worker behind a snack stall at a ski race at Semmering, southwest of Vienna, where the temperature was minus 22C (minus 8F).</p>
<p>Temperatures in Austria have hit their lowest for 30 years. Two people have been reported killed by the cold.</p>
<p>The cold snap claimed three victims in France at the weekend, including a 74-year-old man who refused to swap his unheated caravan for a flat.</p>
<p>Parisians enjoyed the unusual thrill of ice skating on a frozen pond under the shadow of the Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean island of Corsica suffered its heaviest snowfall in a decade at the weekend, with 10,000 people left without electricity.</p>
<p>In Britain forecasters on Monday warned of plunging temperatures, biting winds and heavy snow. Travel organisations urged motorists to stay at home.</p>
<p>A man and a woman died on Sunday after falling into a freezing lake in southeast England while trying to save their dog.</p>
<p>The dog survived.</p>
