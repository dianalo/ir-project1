<p>Israeli troops shot and wounded 28 Palestinians on Tuesday in a fourth day of clashes with Arabs who hurled rocks and petrol bombs in the divided West Bank town of Hebron, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Officials at al-Ahli hospital said a 12-year-old Palestinian boy was in critical condition after a rubber-coated metal bullet penetrated his head.</p>
<p>"It is a kind of war of attrition on the dividing line between the Palestinian Authority and us," Israel's military commander in Hebron, identified only as Brigadier Gadi, told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>"The faster it ends, the better it will be for both sides," he said, calling on the Palestinian Authority and police to do more to quell the violence along what has become a confrontation line between the Israeli and PLO-controlled sections of Hebron.</p>
<p>In another incident just east of the self-rule enclave of Jericho in the West Bank, Jewish settlers tried to expand the settlement of Elisha by fencing off additional land, Palestinians said. The Israeli army was checking the report.</p>
<p>The violence reflects rising tensions over a three-month deadlock in peace efforts and what Palestinians view as a drive to expand Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip and Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank to pre-empt final peace negotiations.</p>
<p>In Hebron, witnesses said several dozen youths, out of school on their summer holiday, used slingshots to pelt Israeli soldiers with stones and threw at least a dozen petrol bombs in the heart of town.</p>
<p>Soldiers immediately deployed opposite the demonstrators and on surrounding roofs. The troops initially withheld fire but when one boy burned a large Israeli flag and danced in front of them they shot at him, wounding him in the leg.</p>
<p>A 72-year-old Palestinian passerby was in serious condition from a rubber-coated bullet which hit him in the forehead, hospital officials said.</p>
<p>They said a total of 28 Palestinians were wounded.</p>
<p>Israel handed 80 percent of Hebron to Palestinian rule under an interim peace deal in January but kept troops at the heart of the town to protect some 400 Jewish settlers who live there in fortified enclaves.</p>
<p>About 100,000 Palestinians live in Hebron.</p>
<p>On Monday, soldiers shot and wounded at least 38 Palestinians in clashes in the town. More than 100 Palestinians have been wounded in four days of violence there.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has accused the Palestinian Authority of ordering violence in Gaza and of doing nothing to stop unrest in Hebron.</p>
<p>On Tuesday at Jericho, Palestinians said Elisha settlers tried to fence off additional land. They said Israeli and Palestinian security forces stopped the expansion and set a meeting for later in the day to resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>The incident was similar to one that sparked the violence in Gaza. Israeli right-wing legislators said they would go to Gaza later on Tuesday to plant trees on disputed land there. Settlers said Palestinians were gathering near Morag settlement in the strip ahead of the legislators' arrival.</p>
<p>On Monday in Gaza, Jewish settlers shot and wounded one Palestinian youth and fired at least three bullets at journalists during a clash.</p>
