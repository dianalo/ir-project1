<p>Constructive engagement is the best way to help Algeria out of its violent political crisis, Dutch secretary of state for European Affairs Michiel Patijn said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"If we can conclude rapidly an association agreement with Algeria, then that may be a positive political factor in that country's attempts to restore order and the rule of law and democracy," he told the European Parliament.</p>
<p>But he warned the EU would only be prepared to cooperate more closely with Algeria if the government of President Liamine Zeroual remained committed to improving its human rights record and holding general elections this year.</p>
<p>Some 60,000 people have died in violence between Moslem rebels and government forces since 1992, when the authorities cancelled a general election which the radical Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) appeared set to win.</p>
<p>German Green Euro-MP Daniel Cohn-Bendit said Patijn was naive: Zeroual's government actually wanted an Islamic state and could not get Algeria out of the mire. Only a lay government could achieve that task.</p>
<p>"Your naivety is a reflection of the naivety of French foreign policy," he said.</p>
<p>Cohn-Bendit, a leader of the student revolt in Paris in 1968, said a peaceful solution would not be easy in Algeria.</p>
<p>"It can only be through a dialogue between killers," he said, adding that while he believed Islamic fundamentalists were responsible for most of the bloodletting, the hands of some members of the government were not clean.</p>
<p>More than 300 people, many women and children, have been killed in a wave of massacres and bomb attacks in the past four weeks in Algiers and neighbouring towns and villages.</p>
<p>Algeria's government-appointed Transitional National Council on Tuesday approved a law banning political parties which have a political platform based on Islam, the official Algerian news agency APS said.</p>
<p>The law gives two legal Islamist parties, Nahda and Hamas, two months to change their manifestos to avoid running foul of the legislation, political sources said.</p>
