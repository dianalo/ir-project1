<p>Showers were forecast for western Kansas and Oklahoma Wednesday, dashing hopes of winter wheat harvest progress, Weather Services Corp said.</p>
<p>"The activity we're watching now is in western Kansas," said Mike Palmerino, meteorologist with WSC. "That's projected to drop down into Oklahoma later today."</p>
<p>Rainfall amounts of 0.2 to 0.6 inch were expected with 50 percent coverage.</p>
<p>North Texas was expected to be warm and dry on Wednesday with high temperatures in the upper 80s to 90s Fahrenheit, but another storm was forecast for Friday.</p>
<p>"Showers and thunderstorms will probably return to most of Oklahoma by Friday afternoon and into northern Texas Friday night," Palmerino said. "Beyond that, Sunday could be fairly dry for most of the harvest regions but it looks like rains come back on Monday."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, spring wheat areas of North Dakota and Montana were suffering from the opposite problem and the dry weather was expected to continue.</p>
<p>"The feeling is right now there's not much in the way of prospects for drought-breaking rains," Palmerino said.</p>
<p>A few showers were possible in South Dakota over the next 24 hours but Palmerino said the moisture would likely miss the driest areas.</p>
<p>Long-range forecasts gave conflicting views with the U.S. model suggesting a storm system would move across the spring wheat belt early next week while the European model remained dry, Palmerino said.</p>
<p>"The U.S. model is attempting to form a major storm over northwest Iowa and southeast South Dakota on Sunday night and Monday," Palmerino said.</p>
<p>"Even if that occurs it probably would not bring much rainfall into the driest areas," he added. "It would rain pretty well, though, in South Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota. The European model is calling for more of the same dry weather."</p>
