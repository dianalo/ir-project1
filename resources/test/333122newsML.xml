<p>A House Republican said Saturday that President Clinton and Congress had to use "honest language" in discussing the future if they were to work together.</p>
<p>Representative Jim Talent of Missouri said in a pre-recorded response to Clinton's regular Saturday radio address that both sides had said they wanted to work together and had used the same rhetoric in describing what they wanted to do.</p>
<p>"That is a good sign," he said. "But if the president and Congress are to move forward together and without hesitation, all must use honest language when discussing the future of America."</p>
<p>Talent said that when Republicans talked about ending the era of big government, "we mean that it is absolutely necessary to change the federal government so that it stops hurting the American people and starts helping them."</p>
<p>He added: "If the president truly understands that as we in Congress understand it, we will be able to move forward together honestly."</p>
