<headline>NZ SPORT-RUGBY UNION--NZ teams may hold early edge in Super 12.</headline>
<text>
<p>WELLINGTON, Feb 28 - Over-use of South African and Australian players in the first year of professional rugby may give New Zealand teams an early edge in the Super 12 series starting in Palmerston North tonight, NZPA reports.</p>
<p>While the Wallabies and the Springboks ran themselves to death on excessively long late-year overseas tours in 1996, the All Blacks had just the week-long romp to Britain for the Barbarians games.  </p>
<p>South Africa's and Australia's massive overuse of their players can be seen in long injury lists, disjointed organisation of pre-season training matches, and sheer unhappiness by some players with their lot.</p>
<p>That is manifested in South Africa where Northern Transvaal -- Auckland's first opponent -- players rebelled against out-of-date coach John Williams. Former Bok coach Kitch Christie, battling cancer, has taken over but his ability to travel to Australia and New Zealand is uncertain.</p>
<p>As well, leading lock Johan Ackerman has been named for alleged steroid abuse.  </p>
<p>Other sides there are also struggling. Transvaal haven't had a full run together, Natal have lost a bundle of leading players to Britain and Western Province, and newcomer Orange Free State just might be the best early bet.</p>
<p>Australia's leading side, Queensland, have not yet put their full team on the field together, and ACT have also bumbled along. New South Wales, however, learned that their 10-match European tour before last season's Super 12 was a shortcut to disaster. This year they have done the job better and look Australia's best chance at present.  </p>
<p>In New Zealand, sides have been selected with more time and more care, and players have had the chance to prepare properly.</p>
<p>Only Otago's British trip and Auckland's little escapade to the northern hemisphere were worrying, Auckland's only because of the timing. Otago lost three All Blacks injured playing the Canterbury Crusaders this week, but manager Des Smith says none of the injuries were caused by the tour.</p>
<p>"We came back from the United Kingdom injury-free," he said.  </p>
<p>Generally, New Zealand's teams are well prepared, and New Zealand Rugby Football Union fitness adviser Martin Toomey is highly enthusiastic about the results he received from each team.</p>
<p>Players, he said, were fitter, faster and very much stronger. Therefore he expected further improvement in skills and speed.</p>
<p>At the All Blacks' summer camp at Taupo, Toomey added 10-15kg to the strength tests for the players and expected some to struggle. But the extra weight was easy for most of them.  </p>
<p>"We would have far fewer fitness concerns than at this time last year," he said. "Then, some teams only came together in January and they didn't really get up to scratch. Now the averages in all teams are significantly higher than they were last season.</p>
<p>"Aerobically the squads are getting close to the standards the All Blacks reached before the 1995 World Cup, and we were generally regarded as the fittest team there."</p>
<p>Toomey agreed New Zealand sides may have an early advantage. He too has heard the stories of how far behind the Australian sides are.  </p>
<p>"Maybe they've been a little too easy on themselves. So many of them went away with the Wallabies and some will still be recovering from injuries. That could be an advantage to us," he said.</p>
<p>Despite Auckland's superiority last season, much depends on the ability to lead the round robin and gain a home venue for playoff matches.</p>
