<p>The Sri Lankan rupee closed firmer against the dollar on Tuesday despite speculation that the Central Bank would allow further falls of the local currency, dealers said.</p>
<p>The rupee ended at 56.12 after opening at 56.28 and fluctuating during the day.</p>
<p>"The demand for dollars was there, but demand for rupees was higher," a Hatton National Bank dealer said.</p>
<p>The overnight call money rate closed the day at 16 percent after reaching 17 percent during the day, dealers said. It closed at 15.5 percent on Monday.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the local currency, which fell to a record low of 56.40 to the dollar on Monday, was expected to fall further.</p>
<p>"The pattern shows the Central Bank is devaluating it by 30 to 40 cents on a monthly basis," the Hatton Natonal dealer said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank pushed up the rupee by half a local cent on Tuesday, setting dollar buying and selling rates at 55.6677 and 56.7923.</p>
<p>"Depending on the money situation tomorrow -- we should see it around 18-19 percent -- the dollar would decline further," a local dealer said. -- Mohan Samarasinghe (941) 434319</p>
