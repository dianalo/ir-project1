<p>DBS Investment Research said on Thursday it has downgraded Ssangyong Cement (Singapore) Ltd to a "sell" as the company was not expecting a better second-half.  </p>
<p>DBS said Ssangyong Cement's interim results were below expectations with a 18.6 percent fall in attributable earnings to Singapore $9.6 million despite turnover growth of 12.9 percent.</p>
<p>DBS cut its full year attributable estimates for the company to a drop of 40.9 percent to S$18.3 million from a gain of 3.6 percent to S$32.2 million.</p>
