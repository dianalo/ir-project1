<p>Seeking to reduce the amount of time children languish in foster care and to provide tougher protections from abuse and neglect, the House Wednesday passed legislation to rewrite federal adoption laws.</p>
<p>The bipartisan measure, which passed by 416-5, would push states to make a child's well-being, rather than family preservation, a top priority in many foster care cases.</p>
<p>Currently states must make "reasonable efforts" to preserve families -- a requirement many experts say has pushed children back into dangerous homes or increased the amount of time many stay trapped in the bulging foster care system.</p>
<p>The new bill requires states to define circumstances such as sexual abuse, abandonment or torture under which they would not have to try to put families back together again.</p>
<p>It was also designed to increase the number of adoptions by requiring states to move more quickly to terminate parental rights and provides a $4,000 payment to states that move children from foster care to adoptive homes.</p>
<p>"Children deserve a compassionate but effective system that works on their behalf, not one that subjects them to continued abuse," Michigan Republican Representative Dave Camp, a chief sponsor of the bill said.</p>
<p>The Senate was expected to take up similar legislation in coming weeks. President Clinton supports the measure. He unveiled his own initiative this year designed to double the number of adoptions from foster homes by the year 2002.</p>
<p>The bill is a response to soaring foster care caseloads and recurring horror stories of children who were killed or maimed after being reunited with abusive parents.</p>
<p>Nearly 500,000 children are in foster care across the United States, a number that has nearly doubled since the 1980s. Studies show most remain in foster care for about three years. The federal cost of helping states care for foster children has also grown to more than $3 billion a year.</p>
<p>To move children more quickly to permanent, adoptive homes the bill would require states to move to terminate parental rights for children under age 10 who have been in foster care for 18 out of the past 24 months.</p>
<p>States would receive $4,000 per child as incentive payments for increasing the number of adoptions from foster care, and $6,000 for special needs children who are adopted.</p>
<p>"That quiet child locked in that terrible situation will not be forced to stay there," Representative Barbara Kennelly, D-Conn., a co-author of the bill said.</p>
<p>About 20,000 children a year are adopted out of foster care. But as a percentage of the overall caseload, adoptions have been declining for a decade.</p>
<p>House Speaker Newt Gingrich praised the legislation, recounting how he was an adopted child. "We think this is very important for...healthy families, for loving families."</p>
<p>The bill also requires states to hold earlier and more frequent status hearings to track children after they enter the foster care system.</p>
<p>The House bill builds on laws approved last year providing a $5,000 tax credit for adoptions and making it easier for prospective parents to adopt a child of a different race.</p>
<p>Child welfare advocates support the legislation, saying the family reunification efforts had been well-intentioned, but had slowed the system and trapped too many children.</p>
<p>"Reasonable efforts have never meant unreasonable efforts. If a kid has been seriously or sexually abused...those are no-brainers," said David Liederman, executive director of the Child Welfare League of America. But he said his group preferred the Senate bill that would provide further financial incentives for adoption.</p>
<p>Republican Representative Todd Tiahrt withdrew an amendment that would have required faster termination of parental rights. "In my state of Kansas we had one young man who at age 14 had been in 130 foster homes. He had been trapped in the system for 11 years because the state would not give up on trying to rehabilitate his parents," Tiahrt said.</p>
