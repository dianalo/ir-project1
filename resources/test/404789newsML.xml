<p>The European Union said on Wednesday it deeply deplored Israel's approval of the building of new Jewish housing in Arab East Jerusalem.  </p>
<p>"The EU deeply deplores the decision of the Israeli government to approve construction plans for Har Homa/Jabal Abu Ghneim located on the West Bank in the Jerusalem area," a statement issued by the Dutch EU presidency said.</p>
<p>"The EU has repeatedly stated that settlements in the occupied territories contravene international law and are a major obstacle to peace," the statement said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday Israel approved the building of new Jewish housing in Arab East Jerusalem despite warnings the project could unleash a wave of Palestinian violence.</p>
<p>The homes will be built at Jabal Abu Ghneim, called Har Homa by Israel, a tree-covered hill taken by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war. The site is between Jerusalem and Bethlehem.</p>
