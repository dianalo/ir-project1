<p>Controls on plutonium at nuclear power stations could be relaxed under a plan being considered by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), New Scientist magazine reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>It said the controls had been in place since 1957 and that proposals to loosen them were opposed by the United States and anti-nuclear campaigners.</p>
<p>"They fear it will make life easier for terrorists and rogue states who want to build atomic bombs. It also comes against a background of renewed controversy over whether reactor-grade plutonium can be used to make bombs," said the weekly science magazine.</p>
<p>At the root of the controversy is a suggestion by the IAEA's Bruno Pellaud that plutonium could be split into sub-groups, so that reactor-grade plutonium would require less stringent safeguards than weapons-grade plutonium.</p>
<p>According to the IAEA, almost 1,000 tonnes of plutonium have been created by the world's civil reactors. That is enough to make at least 125,000 atomic bombs, said the magazine.</p>
<p>The New Scientist said the Pellaud plan would be discussed by the agency in October.</p>
<p>It was proposed after complaints by France and Germany, among others, that new nuclear safeguards agreed by the agency last month were too costly and intrusive.</p>
<p>The stiff new safeguards were designed to avoid a repeat of the failure to spot Iraq's nuclear weapons programme before the Gulf War.</p>
