<p>National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB) said on Monday it would not continue to buy its shares, under the back-back scheme announced last month, until after the announcement of its half-year results, scheduled for May 15.  </p>
<p>"The bank deemed this was the most appropriate prudent course of action," NAB said in a brief statement.</p>
<p>NAB said it has bought 18.41 million of its shares under the scheme at a cost of A$298 million. It has 70.84 million shares remaining to be purchased under the scheme.</p>
<p>The buy-back started on April 8 and was due to end on October 7, 1997. Brokers to the buy-back were J.Were &amp; Son and Merrill Lynch Equities (Australia) Ltd.</p>
<p>At 11.00 a.m. (0100 GMT), NAB shares were 28.1 cents up at A$16.79. The shares were trading around A$15.50 before it announced the share-buy back scheme on March 24.</p>
