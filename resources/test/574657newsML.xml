<p>The trend number of New Zealand job ads rose 0.5 percent in April, ANZ Bank said on Monday.</p>
<p>But in annual terms, April's figures were down 4.6 percent on April 1996.</p>
<p>Job ads in Auckland rose 0.9 during April but signs of weakness were prevalent in the other main centres, in particular Christchurch, where the drop was 1.5 percent. Ads in Wellington rose 0.1 percent.  </p>
<p>ANZ chief economist in New Zealand, Paul Stewart, said the job ad trends tended to confirm employment would remain subdued in the near term.</p>
<p>"Overall, the job market is clearly not as buoyant as it was and the official employment statistics up to March confirm that," he said.</p>
<p>Statistics New Zealand said last week the official unemployment rate rose to 6.4 percent from 5.9 percent at March 31.  </p>
<p>Stewart said it was important to note that job advertisements were still well ahead of levels a few years ago and employment growth had been very strong in recent years.</p>
<p>"The job ad figures provide a further indication that economic activity has softened in 1997 as has been widely expected," Stewart said.</p>
<p>He said the job ad series pointed to a subdued, rather than depressed, economy and the task facing the Reserve Bank was to determine whether or not the economy had slowed to the point that inflation would fall away significantly more quickly than it had previously forecast.  </p>
