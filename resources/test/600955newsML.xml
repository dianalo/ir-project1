<p>The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday that EmCare Holdings Inc agreed to pay $7.75 million to settle allegations it overcharged several federal health care insurance programs.</p>
<p>It said the firm will pay the federal government $6.5 million and various states $1.2 million to resolve allegations of false billings to the Medicare, Medicaid and other programs.  </p>
<p>The Justice Department said EmCare, an emergency physician staffing company, hired an Oklahoma City billing firm to submit the claims on its behalf and that the firm billed for services more extensive and expensive than those actually performed.</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services said EmCare has agreed to adopt various steps to ensure compliance with federal laws in the future.</p>
<p>The settlement resolved a civil lawsuit filed in federal court in Oklahoma City, the Justice Department said.</p>
