<p>The chairman of the Senate Environment Committee Wednesday said he felt that proposed new air quality standards may be "too far-reaching."</p>
<p>"These are very complex and far-reaching proposals. After careful review, I am concerned they may be too far-reaching," Sen. John Chafee, a Rhode Island Republican, said in remarks prepared for a hearing on the proposed new air standards.</p>
<p>The Environmental Protection Agency has proposed setting tighter standards against soot and smog pollution.</p>
<p>"Frankly there is reason to be worried about the health of the Clean Air Act," Chafee said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Although EPA has done a good job on the acid rain and stratospheric protection provisions of the 1990 amendments, the ozone non-attainment programme has fallen far behind schedule. And these two new standards -- among the very largest regulations ever issued by EPA -- would be piled on top," Chafee said.</p>
<p>EPA Administrator Carol Browner was to testify at the hearing.</p>
