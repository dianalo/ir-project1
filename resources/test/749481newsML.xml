<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Thursday were seen $0.50 to $1.00 per cwt lower, pressured by a continued slide in pork product prices, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>The lower pork prices pushed packer operating margins deeper into the red, they said.</p>
<p>Losses were furthered by larger-than-expected interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hog marketings on Tuesday and outlooks for hefty movement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Interior movement Tuesday totalled 115,000 head, above the estimate of 110,000, USDA reported.  </p>
<p>Interior hog movement on Wednesday was pegged at 105,000 head, although several hog dealers said actual receipts were likely above that level.</p>
<p>Midday ham prices were quoted steady to $2.00 per cwt lower, pork bellies were $3.00 lower and lean trimmings mostly off $6.00, USDA said in its central U.S. carlot pork report.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota top prices for hogs delivered to the plant were seen $59.00 to $59.50. Illinois top hog prices at the plant were seen $59.00 to $59.50 and Indiana/Ohio hogs were seen $59.00 at the plant.</p>
