<p>Kuwait's parliament on Tuesday rejected an Islamist bill banning concerts and fashion shows that fail to comply with the teachings of Islam.</p>
<p>After winning a first round of voting last week, the bill attracted 20 votes out of 44 in the final vote on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Islamists object to women singing to an audience that includes men or vice-versa as well as to women dressing attractively around men who are not close relatives.</p>
<p>Politicians have said the government had campaigned to thwart the bill. Officials said there was no need for such a measure since the conservative Gulf Arab state already observes Islamic teachings in all areas.</p>
<p>"There is no need for such a law that would only give a wrong impression about Kuwait," said an official. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Islamists have slammed the government for allowing concerts after stopping them for five years following the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The proposed bill imposed a six-month jail term and a fine of not less than 5,000 dinars ($16,500) on violaters of the ban.</p>
<p>The government expressed willingness to discuss rules governing such functions with a parliamentary panel.</p>
<p>Kuwait already bans public dancing and alcohol. Discotheques, once tolerated, were closed in the 1980s.</p>
