<p>British Petroleum Plc, the oil company, said on Tuesday it had opened its first Russian service station in the country's capital Moscow.</p>
<p>The complex, which offers more than 2,00 product lines ranging from car parts to groceries, is a joint development with U.S. burger chain McDonalds which has built a drive-in restaurant into the site.  </p>
<p>The site is passed by 80,000 cars a day, said a BP statement. The station will be open 24 hours a day and will employ 35 people.</p>
<p>If successful, BP said it hoped to add more sites in the city in 1997.</p>
