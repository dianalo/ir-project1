<p>The Sri Lankan rupee ended at an all-time low of 56.85 to the dollar on Wednesday as late import demand drove the dollar up, dealers said.</p>
<p>This compares with the previous record close of 56.80 on Monday. It opened at the same level on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>"There was enough import covering to drive up the dollar," said an American Express Bank dealer, adding speculators were mainly on the sidelines. There was no major movement for most of the day.</p>
<p>"With the dollar so close to the Central Bank selling level, speculators are shy to carry plus positions," he said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank earlier on Wednesday pushed up the dollar by 2.25 local cents, fixing buying and selling prices at 55.8608 and 56.9893.</p>
<p>The overnight call money rate closed at 15.5 percent after opening at 16 percent.</p>
