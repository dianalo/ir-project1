<p>Indian Planning Minister Yogendra Alagh said on Wednesday the government's Central Statistical Organisation will begin releasing estimates of gross domestic product every quarter from next January.</p>
<p>The Indian government currently releases provisional, quick and final forecasts of GDP, but not at regular intervals.</p>
<p>"We have decided to join a global group in which we will give electronic information on short-term trends in the economy," Alagh told a business seminar.</p>
<p>The figures would be provided to the International Monetary Fund for a data survey of 33 countries, Alagh later told Reuters. But the figures will be first released in New Delhi.</p>
