<p>Germany's federal, state and local governments have reached a compromise on repayment of 8.4 billion marks ($5.51 billion) in communist-period east German debt, Chancellery Minister Friedrich Bohl said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The principal will be absorbed by the federal government's standing programme for servicing east German debt, while the 630 million marks in annual debt service payments will be shared equally by Bonn and the east German states.</p>
<p>The federal government pledged not to finance its share in a way that would disadvantage the eastern states, which fear Bonn might reduce other forms of aid.</p>
<p>The states said they would present within one month a plan on how they would finance their share of the interest.</p>
<p>The dispute over who should repay the debt has been simmering for a year.</p>
<p>The funds were originally disbursed by the defunct East German government for the construction of schools, sports facilities and other public projects.</p>
<p>Local governments claimed the debts were a product of specious socialist bookkeeping and might never have had to be repaid if Germany had not been reunified.</p>
