<title>ITALY: Italian bonds/futures.</title>

<p>Italian bond futures eased back on profit-taking in late afternoon ahead of the final round of Italian cities reporting December CPI inflation which analysts expect to stay largely steady at November's 2.6 pecent rate.</p>
<p>Data from the four Italian cities on Thursday suggested inflation at around November's 2.6 percent level in December, and dealers say there is still the possibility of an interest rate cut from the Bank of Italy later today.</p>
<p>"If Thursday's data is confirmed the Bank of Italy has room to cut, perhaps as early as tonight after the figures from the last six cities," one dealer said.  </p>
<p>Futures were supported early by strong U.S. T-bonds and Thursday's CPI numbers but then ran into some profit-taking.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Prime Minister Romano Prodi said the government will decide in February or March if a 1997 mini-budget is needed, and if needed any such a measure would consist entirely of spending cuts.</p>
<p>He added that current measures would not meet EMU deficit/GDP target but an interest rate cut could change that.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the rise in Italian unemployment to 12.2 percent in October from 11.7 percent for July given in ISTAT's quarterly report had little market impact.</p>
