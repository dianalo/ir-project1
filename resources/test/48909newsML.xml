<p>The Nairobi Stock Exchange (NSE) 20-share index fell on Thursday in dull trading, brokers said.</p>
<p>The index fell 7.86 points to stand at 3066.97. Turnover was 5.662 million shillings on 221,560 shares from 13.811 million shillings on 416,397 shares on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A bourse official described the market's trading as "quite dull" and added that only thin volumes were traded. There was very little buying of shares in most counters.</p>
<p>He said a few people were buying and even fewer selling but prices in some counters had edged up especially agriculturals.</p>
<p>A senior broker said that activity was subdued as only a few players were in the market -- with Kenya Airways and National Bank of Kenya continuing to be active.</p>
<p>"There is no specific reason to give for the current directionless market movement," a broker said.</p>
<p>"We cannot say that the news of Kenya Commercial Bank starting to sell 11.18 million primary shares is driving away investors from their current counters," he added.</p>
<p>The government is set to free another 10 percent of its shareholding in Kenya Commercial Bank next week. It currently has a 70 percent stake with the remainder owned by the public through the Nairobi Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>National Bank of Kenya eased to 17.90 from 18 on 71,275 shares, Barclays Bank rose to 106 but eased back to 102 from 105 while Kenya Commercial Bank held steady at 55.</p>
<p>Among the plantations, Brooke Bond rose a shilling to 177, Rea Vipingo gained to 11.05 from 11 and Sasini Tea &amp; Coffee rose to 52.50 from 51.50.</p>
<p>In commercials, Kenya Airways traded 84,001 shares at 11.25, 11.10 and 11.15, Express Ltd fell to 80.50 from 83, Car &amp; General eased to 21 from 21.25.</p>
<p>British American Tobbacco fell a shilling to 68, Kenya Breweries eased to 46 from 47.25 while Total Kenya was unchanged at 72.</p>
