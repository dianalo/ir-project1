<p>Jury selection began on Monday in grocery store chain Food Lion Inc.'s lawsuit against the ABC television network for a program claiming the grocer sold old food and even repackaged out-of-date meat.</p>
<p>The trial, four years after the network's newsmagazine "PrimeTime Live" aired the report, centers around unaired videotape showing that Food Lion workers sold out-of-date merchandise and changed expiration dates on other items. Food Lion maintains its workers were coerced by the ABC producers working undercover with hidden cameras at two of its stores.</p>
<p>"ABC denies Food Lion's charges and we look forward to making our case in front of the jury," spokeswoman Teri Everett said. "Everything on the hidden camera tape is exactly as it occurred."</p>
<p>Food Lion's stock suffered dramatically after the November 1992 show, although analysts said stores in Texas were also struggling at the time.</p>
<p>Ken Gassman of Davenport &amp; Co. said the show "appeared to be the catalyst" for a slide in earnings from the 1992 fourth quarter through 1994 and part of 1995. Earnings per share for 1992 were $0.37 versus $0.22 the following year. A turnaround began last year when net income was $0.36 per share, he said.</p>
<p>The unaired videotapes demonstrated staging on the part of ABC producers, Food Lion spokeswoman Chris Ahearn said.</p>
<p>Salisbury, N.C.-based Food Lion, a unit of Belgian retailer Ets Delhaize Freres et Cie LE LION SA, was charging fraud, deceptive trade practices, conspiracy and breach of duty of loyalty against ABC and producers. The trial also raises ethical issues for the media's news gathering process and may become a litmus test of whether companies will be able to sue for any expose they dislike.</p>
<p>"(Food Lion) is attacking the way the story was obtained instead of persuing a libel claim," said David Logan, a media law professor at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C.</p>
<p>The judge's concern, he added, was that a hometown jury might award millions of dollars in damages. "The message to be sent, to smaller news organizations in particular, is: 'Don't you dare take on the powerful economic interests in the community even if your story is truthful because if they can turn around and sue you, the fact that it's truthful is not a defense,'" Logan said.</p>
<p>Food Lion officials would not confirm that $2.5 billion in damages was being sought from New York-based ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co..</p>
<p>A panel of six jurors and six alternates was to be chosen from a pool of 60. Seven have been dismissed on claims of owning stock or knowing someone who works for the grocer or bias toward the media.</p>
<p>"I totally feel with Food Lion," said one woman whose daughter works for the grocery chain.</p>
<p>"I don't buy meat at Food Lion because of the story. We buy other things there," one man said.</p>
<p>During pretrial hearings last week in federal court in Greensboro, N.C., a lawyer said the network cannot be ordered to pay damages for airing the investigative piece. A free press needs breathing space and "deception is a legitimate ... technique journalists use to verify information they receive," said William Jeffres, representing ABC.</p>
