<p>----------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - APRIL 15 -----------</p>
<p>+ NYMEX crude expected to consolidate on Tuesday. In the case of an up move, a settlement above $20 would be a positive sign.</p>
<p>+ Gasoline also seen movog sideways, break of 62.20/30 cents level would open door for further gains.</p>
<p>+ Heating oil resistance a 55.05 and then 55.20/30 cents.</p>
<p>NYMEX crude was expected to spend Tuesday's session consolidating, although increasing numbers of players appeared to be champing at the bit to push the market higher, chartists said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>May crude closed 37 cents higher at $19.90 but last traded at $19.77.</p>
<p>"We appear to be in a holding pattern here," said Charles Gray at Prudential Bache in London.</p>
<p>"I think we'll see it consolidating for a while longer although I don't expect it to move lower," said Victor Yu at Refco in New York, noting the spot months holding above Fibonacci support at $18.71.</p>
<p>"We've also got a spinning body on the weekly chart which is a fairly neutral sign but does suggest we've put in the lows," said Yu. "It's trying to consolidate."</p>
<p>The double bottom at $18.96 on April 4 and 10 also continued to be supportive.</p>
<p>He said a close above $20 would be a positive signal for the market to push cautiously higher.</p>
<p>Chartists also noted stubborn interim resistance around the $19.90 level.</p>
<p>On the products front, few chartists expected much in the way of price moves ahead of the American Petroleum Institute data out late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>May heat closed 0.80 cent off 54.67 cents a gallon and was 0.02 cents off in ACCESS. May gasoline ended 1.16 cents higher at 61.96 cents a gallon and was 0.06 cent off in ACCESS trading.</p>
<p>Gray pegged resistance for May gasoline around Monday's highs at 62.30-50, and for front-month heating oil around recent highs at 55.20-30 cents.</p>
<p>Chartists at MeesPierson Derivative, using their Market Profile chart technique, pegged resistance for gasoline at 62.10, 63.30 and 64.20 cents and support at 61.35 60.75 and 59.55 cents.</p>
<p>"Look to buy on dips, to 61.60.50. Cut if we cover 61.05, and consider taking profits as we approach 62.10 cents but if we move through this strongly, look for up to 63.20/30," they said in their daily report. -- Melanie Goodfellow, London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7714.</p>
