<headline>Gray Communications completes acquisitions.</headline>
<dateline>ALBANY, Ga. 1996-09-30</dateline>

<p>Gray Communications Systems Inc said on Monday it completed the acquisition of two television stations, a satellite and production business, and a paging business for approximately $180 million, including certain liabilities assumed.</p>
<p>Gray said it acquired WCTV-TV, the CBS affiliate in Tallahassee, Fla./Thomasville, Ga., and WKXT-TV, the CBS affiliate in Knoxville, Tenn. John H. Phipps Inc is the seller in this transaction.  </p>
<p>The FCC requires the company to divest ownership of its WALB-TV station in Albany, Ga., and WJHG-TV in Panama City, Fla., within six months, Gray said. If the FCC revises its rules of common ownership of TV stations with overlapping signals, the company may not need to sell the stations.</p>
<p>The FCC is not expected to complete its re-examination of these regulations until early next year, the company said.</p>
<p>The company is also aquiring Satellite Production Services, a Tallahassee, Fla.-based satellite and production company, and Portaphone Paging, a communications and paging business in the southeastern United States, it said.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the company's offerings of $160 million of 10-5/8 percent senior subordinated notes due 2006 and 3.5 million shares of Class B Common Stock at $20.50 per share were used to fund this acquisition, the company said.</p>
