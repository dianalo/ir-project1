<p>Venezuela's National Securities Commission (CNV) said on Friday that it had lifted the suspension on trading of paints and packaging company Corimon so that trading can re-start on Monday.</p>
<p>"The order goes out today so that it (Corimon) can start trading Monday," a CNV spokeswoman said.  </p>
<p>The CNV had also sent the order to restart trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Corimon is the only Venezuelan stock listed, she said.</p>
<p>The CNV suspended trading of Corimon shares in February after the stock plummeted on poor financial results. The suspension was recently extended until the end of October, but it was decided to lift it "because there is no obstacle, the conditions are there for it to return to the market," the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Corimon reported a third quarter net profit of 700 million bolivars on Friday, down from 1.782 billion bolivars in the same quarter of 1995.</p>
