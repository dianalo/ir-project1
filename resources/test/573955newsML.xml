<p>The yen will likely rise further against the dollar given political factors now seen as key to exchange rate moves, economists and dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>Market players are shifting their attention to worries over Japan's rising trade surplus gap with the United States and away from the U.S.-Japan interest rate gap which had fuelled the dollar's rally earlier this year, they said.</p>
<p>"Market attention is finally shifting to the trade issue," said Richard C. Koo, a senior economist at Nomura Research Institute Ltd.</p>
<p>"Pushing the yen higher would be the only option for Japanese authorities right now to avoid a rise in the external imbalance and calls from the United States to stimulate domestic demand," he added.</p>
<p>The dollar slid below 123 yen in Tokyo on Friday, the first time it had dropped below that level since April 4. The latest fall meant the greenback was down nearly 3.8 percent from its peak of 127.47 yen hit on May 1.</p>
<p>Market analysts said Japanese authorities appeared keen to bolster the yen ahead of a Group of Seven (G7) leaders' summit in Denver in June, so as to head off trade friction with Washington.</p>
<p>"The yen will likely strengthen further on a short-term horizon, led by political incentives," said an official at the finance department of a major Japanese carmarker. "There is a strong political intention by the government to push the dollar down from the 125 yen level ahead of Denver summit."</p>
<p>Japanese officials including the Finance Ministry's Eisuke Sakakibara, known as "Mr Yen" for his influence in currency markets, are keeping up a steady stream of comments in hinting at possible dollar-selling intervention by central banks.</p>
<p>Such intervention, the official said, could topple the dollar to below 120 yen if it materialised.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto vowed to avoid a resurgence of Japan's trade surplus with the United Sates by promoting domestic demand-led growth when he met U.S. President Bill Clinton last month. U.S. exporters have been complaining that the weak yen was hurting their competitiveness abroad.</p>
<p>Japan's trade surplus with the United States has been rising over the past six months, increasing 11.2 percent to $3.04 billion in March alone.</p>
<p>Given Tokyo's determination to cut public spending and get its budget deficit under control, boosting the yen looks like the only way to rein in the trade surplus, economists said.</p>
<p>A stronger yen would make Japanese exports less competitive overseas while making imports into Japan cheaper.</p>
<p>Expectations that the U.S.-Japan interest rate gap may narrow due to an earlier-than-expected rise in Japanese interest rates are also boosting the yen against the dollar.</p>
<p>Markets are now speculating the Bank of Japan could tighten credit as early as July, although many economists dismiss that as unlikely.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Japanese exporters -- caught off guard by the dollar's sudden tumble -- have been forced to join a wave of dollar sales to protect their overseas earnings, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Some exporters who had taken a relaxed stance until yesterday were pressed...to arrange their dollar sales today," said Wataru Ito, deputy general manager at the treasury department of Sanwa Bank Ltd.</p>
<p>Ito said the volume of exporters' sales was not huge but that they seemed keen to arrange sales in order to convert overseas earnings into yen at a rate above 120 yen in June and July.</p>
<p>Major Japanese manufacturers have figured their internal operation costs based on an exchange rate of 115-120 yen in the first half of this fiscal year from April, and a steep rise in the yen's value beyond that level would hurt exporters severely.</p>
