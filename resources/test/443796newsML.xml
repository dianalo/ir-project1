<p>German military helicopters have safely flown about 100 Germans and other foreigners out of Albania, the foreign ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources in Tirana said six helicopters had flown into the country to pick up the group because road transport was deemed too dangerous.  </p>
<p>The spokesman did not say where the helicopters had landed.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel and Defence Minister Volker Ruehe would announce more details at a news conference in about one hour, he said.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, German officials said there were 12 or 13 Germans still in Tirana as well as about 50 foreigners under Bonn's consular protection.</p>
<p>These were mostly Hungarians and Austrians, a foreign ministry spokesman said, and there were also a few Japanese and Belgians in the group.</p>
