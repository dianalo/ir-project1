<p>Two major Internet service providers in Japan and the United States have joined hands to launch a dial-roaming service they hope will expand business.</p>
<p>NTT Data Corp. and MCI Communications Corp. said Thursday the new service  will allow overseas travelers to access the Internet without contracting with a local Internet provider.</p>
<p>The new service will be available in Japan and the United States in July.</p>
<p>"Using our new service will mean a significant cost reduction for overseas business travelers because they don't have to make expensive international telephone calls (in order to log on to the Internet)," an NTT Data official said.</p>
<p>He said a Japanese traveller to the United States using the Internet for one hour during business hours would pay about $15, compared with the $61 charge for a one-hour international call.</p>
<p>The tie-up will be expanded into Europe and other parts of Asia in the future.</p>
<p>NTT Data president Tomeo Kanbayashi told a news conference that his company aims to more than triple the number of users of its Internet joint venture with Softbank Corp. to 200,000 by the end of next March from the current 60,000.</p>
<p>"NTT Data aims to become the No. 1 Internet service provider in Japan in the near future," Kanbayashi said. At the same news conference, MCI senior Vice President Vinton Cerf said MCI planned to boost its annual revenues from Internet services to $2 billion a year by 2000, representing about 6 percent of total revenues by that date.</p>
