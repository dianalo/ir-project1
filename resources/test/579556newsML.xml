<p>Montana Power Co (MPC) said Tuesday it will install a $20-million mobile automated meter-reading system to upgrade service for its electric and natural gas customers, and to become more competitive.</p>
<p>"(An automated system) provides improved customer service through accuracy and reliability, and it provides a platform for future services," Bob Gannon, MPC president, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Using the technology also will allow Montana Power to market meter-reading services to other utilities providing water, electricity or gas.</p>
<p>The utility said it will begin converting to the new metering system in July, and expects to complete the process in two years.</p>
<p>"We will actively pursue other meter-reading opportunities throughout Montana Power's service territory, offering other companies or cities cost-competitive meter reading and ability to provide their customers additional services through strategic alliances with MPC," Gannon said.</p>
<p>Under legislation passed earlier this year, Montana will begin to deregulate its electricity industry in July 1998.</p>
