<p>Sentrachem's wholly-owned subsidiary Seetrade Ltd, has issued $85 million compulsory convertible preference shares to refinance a bridging loan, the company said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The transaction, which was underwritten by French bank Societe Generale, was effective August 30, it said.  </p>
<p>"The equity placement has been arranged to re-finance the 12-month bridging loan raised at the time of Sentrachem's acquisition last year of Hampshire Chemical Corp, the U.S. speciality chemicals company," the company said.</p>
<p>The preference shares would be convertible into Sentrachem Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) over three years, at Sentrachem's option or a longer period by mutual agreement.</p>
<p>The issue of GDRs would be at market related prices at the time of conversion, Sentrachem financial director Norman Kennelly said.</p>
<p>He said the issue enabled Sentrachem to secure long-term equity finance at improved rates and improved the capital structure of the balance sheet while significantly reducing gearing.</p>
