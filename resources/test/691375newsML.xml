<p>Hong Kong stocks closed modestly higher on Thursday after gains were trimmed by investors taking profit before the three-day market holiday next week marking Hong Kong's handover on July 1, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index rose 63 points, or 0.42 percent, to finish at 15,128.02. Turnover was HK$25.86 billion, up from HK$22.72 billion on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Light selling ahead of the handover holidays trimmed gains," said Franco Tong, institutional sales manager at New China Hong Kong Securities. Handover euphoria had added as much as 210 points to the blue-chip index before it slipped, he said.</p>
<p>"There is a liquidity argument that says with the money coming into Hong Kong from China there is a general perception that the market will go up after the handover," said James Osborn, sales director at ING Barings.</p>
<p>Red chips continued to be hot, with Chinese money seen snapping up heavyweight and quality counters, a broker said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng red chip index rose 59.73 points, or 1.88 percent, to 3,244.69 after hitting a record high of 3,291.22.</p>
<p>China Resources Jumped HK$3.00 to HK$34.90 and China Merchants rose HK$2.25 to HK$23.40.</p>
<p>But COSCO Pacific eased HK$0.20 to HK$15.25.</p>
<p>The expiry of June index futures in the afternoon also added volatility to the blue-chip index, which swung through 333 points over the course of the day, brokers said.</p>
<p>The June contract rose 29 points to 15,089, while July put on 80 points to HK$15,250.</p>
<p>Hang Seng Bank led blue-chip gainers by rising HK$5.00 to HK$108.00. Brokers said the stock was lifted by hopes Chinese firms might be interested in taking a stake in the bank.</p>
<p>Hopewell surged HK$0.475 to HK$4.75 on market talk it might also be a target of interest from Chinese firms.</p>
<p>Construction firm OLS Group ended its trading debut at HK$1.33, well below the issue price of HK$1.65.</p>
<p>Its performance was affected by a labour dispute involving the company and limited investor interest in construction counters, brokers said.</p>
<p>Another debutant, Leading Spirit Conrowa, closed at HK$1.39, a 39 percent rise from the issue price of HK$1.00.</p>
<p>But brokers said investors were a bit disappointed as the stock had traded as high as HK$2.00 in the grey market.</p>
