<p>Greek short-term interbank depos were softer, forex forwards were holding late Wednesday levels, bonds were trading narrowly and ecu/drachma was firmer around mid-session, traders said.</p>
<p>"Short-term depos up to one-month periods are down a tenth of a point and forex forwards are steady holding late Wednesday levels," said a dealer at a private bank. "The market is very quiet so far."</p>
<p>Bond prices were little changed, dealers said.</p>
<p>"It is relatively quiet after yesterday's mini-rally in fixed coupon and two-year zeros," said a senior bond dealer at a private bank. "We have seen investors switching out of FRNs and into fixed coupon bonds and two-year zeros lately."</p>
<p>But the dealer said he expected investors to be lured back into FRNs offering yields above 10 percent. Five-year fixed coupon bonds offering a gross yield of 8.80 percent were ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>"With the 12-month T-bill rate at 9.70 percent and FRN discount margins of 35 to 40 basis points, it is just a matter of time before investors are lured back into floaters," the senior dealer said. "But five-year bonds are ahead of the curve."</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 159.07/12 from Wednesday's 159.005 fix, the dollar at 270.10/20 drachmas from 267.990 and the ecu at 310.78/88 from 310.470 drachmas.</p>
<p>"Monday is a US holiday and we are working with an extra valeur day. As a result, spot ecu/drachma has nudged up trading around 310.78/83 from Wednesday's close of 310.65/70," said a forex dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>The dealer said he expected players from abroad who were long ecu, short drachma to square positions in the next few days driving the ecu/drachma cross lower.</p>
