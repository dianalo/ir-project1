<p>British Gas Plc said on Monday it was disappointed by its failure to win a licence to explore for oil in waters north of the Falkland Islands but that it would study future opportunities in the region.</p>
<p>"We are naturally disappointed that we weren't selected but we will continue to watch developments in the South Atlantic very closely," a British Gas spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Last November, British Gas signed an agreement with Argentina's YPF SA to study jointly the potential for oil and gas exploration around the Falklands.</p>
<p>The Falkland Islands government on Monday awarded oil exploration licences to 13 companies. Seven tranches of sea to the north of the islands, covering about 12,800 square km, were licensed.</p>
