<p>The number of people infected with the AIDS virus in Vietnam is about 12 times higher than the number published in the official media, according to government estimates unveiled by the United Nations on Thursday.</p>
<p>Rima Salah, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) representative in Hanoi, said that according to unofficial Ministry of Health estimates 84,195 Vietnamese are infected with HIV, the virus which leads to AIDS.</p>
<p>The ministry estimated that 263,229 people in the country would be HIV/AIDS victims by 2000, equivalent to more than 0.3 percent of the projected population at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>By coincidence, the state-controlled Saigon Times Daily published an update of official nationwide figures on Thursday -- 6,229 people infected with the virus and just 860 with AIDS.</p>
<p>Government officials were not available to comment on the discrepancy between the official numbers -- which are calculated from selected provinces and social groups -- and the ministry's estimates.</p>
<p>UNAIDS workers in Vietnam say that, despite the statistics, the government does not deny the seriousness of its problem.</p>
<p>In the first few years of its official AIDS campaign, from 1990 to 1993, the government focused on jailing people involved in the sex trade and drug abusers.</p>
<p>Some National AIDS Committee officials now believe this may have been counterproductive because it drove intravenous drug users underground, where HIV could spread silently through the sharing of contaminated needles, instead of encouraging behavioural change.</p>
<p>Giuseppe Cuboni, chairman of UNAIDS in Vietnam, told a news conference to launch a drive for the prevention of HIV infection in children that "the attitude of the ostrich is no longer here".</p>
<p>He said the international community would understand the situation better if the ministry's estimates were widely published, but argued that control of the epidemic depended on actions taken and not numbers.</p>
