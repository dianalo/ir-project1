<p>German banking association BVR on Wednesday predicted that German interest rates were likely to continue to fall after last week's cut in the main money market rate, which it said would have little economic impact.</p>
<p>"The main effect (of the cut) is to calm capital and currency markets, thus securing the economic recovery which is becoming increasingly probable," BVR said of the 30-basis point cut which sent the repo to an historic low of three percent.</p>
<p>"The signals are more towards a further rate cut in the near future than a monetary tightening."</p>
<p>BVR, the umbrella assocation for the German co-operative banks, said the current rate of money supply growth was consistent with a high level of price stability, which would not be endangered by the recent rate easing.</p>
<p>German M3 money supply growth, the Bundesbank's main policy indicator, slowed to an annualised 8.6 percent in July from 9.6 percent in June.</p>
<p>"Many things argue in favour of stable prices in the short term as well. The inflation rate has been steady below two percent for one and a quarter years. This price trend will not change significantly in the rest of this year," the BVR said.</p>
<p>Even if the Bundesbank opted to keep rates on hold, the banking group said the central bank was unlikely to raise rates until late in 1997.</p>
