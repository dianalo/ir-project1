<p>The U.S. House of Representatives committee on banking and financial services will hold a hearing on the Sumitomo Corp copper trading scandal Sept 18, the committee announced.</p>
<p>The hearing will explore Sumitomo's losses in allegedly unauthorized copper trading, the extent of U.S. bank involvement, the effect on U.S. firms and markets and the worldwide policy implications surrounding such losses.</p>
<p>In June, Sumitomo fired its head copper trader and announced it had lost $1.8 billion in copper markets over the past 10 years.  </p>
<p>Federal Reserve Board member Susan Phillips, Commodity Futures Trading Commission chairwoman Brooksley Born, and Rep. Charles Schumer are expected to testify.</p>
<p>Schumer is expected to present a bill to give CFTC additional jurisdiction over futures contracts traded on foreign exchanges with delivery points in the U.S.</p>
<p>Daniel Rappaport, chairman of New York Mercantile Exchange, Patrick Thompson, president of NYMEX, and Douglas Ostrom, senior economist at the Japan Economic Institute of America, are also scheduled to appear at the hearing.</p>
