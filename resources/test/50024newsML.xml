<p>The lower house of India's parliament approved the government's 1996/97 (April-March) Finance Bill by voice vote on Thursday and sent it to the upper house for consideration.  </p>
<p>The Finance Bill includes the government's tax proposals for the current fiscal year and is the centrepiece of the budget package expected to win final approval by the end of the parliamentary session, set for Friday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Finance Minister P. Chidambaram stood by a controversial minimum alternate tax (MAT), widely opposed by industry, while offering to exempt ailing firms and companies located in economically depressed regions from the tax.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the lower house, or Lok Sabha, approved the government's spending proposals contained in the 1996/97 appropriations bill, and sent them to the upper house, or the Rajya Sabha, for consideration.</p>
