<p>An explosion occurred in south-central Belfast on Saturday afternoon and there were reports of casualties, police said.</p>
<p>The explosion happened in mid-afternoon and some residents said it appeared to have been caused by a car bomb.  </p>
<p>One student at nearby Queens University said he saw a car on fire. Few other details were immediately available.</p>
<p>The explosion occurred during a tense weekend in Northern Ireland after British Prime Minister Tony Blair was sternly critical of the Irish Republican Army murder last Monday of two Northern Ireland policemen.</p>
<p>He said the killings were staged at the very moment that Britain was exploring ways to bring the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, into Belfast peace talks from which it is excluded because of continuing IRA violence.</p>
