<p>Following is the full text of the May Report on Services of the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply. The survey is sponsored by Reuters.</p>
<p>Services activity shows strongest rise to date, with further growth predicted.</p>
<p>The latest CIPS survey of the UK service economy found a further significant improvement in business conditions in May.</p>
<p>The Business Activity Index rose to a new high of 64.8, the eleventh consecutive monthly improvement recorded by this survey. Just under 40% of companies reported an increase in activity.</p>
<p>The rise in activity reflected an increase in the number of firms found to have been boosting capacity to meet strengthening demand for their services. The rate of growth of incoming new business has picked up significantly over the past seven months and accelerated again in May to record the largest monthly rise reported to date.</p>
<p>Panel members generally expect business conditions to continue improving over the next year, driven largely by continued growth in the UK economy, especially greater spending on services by consumers. In May 71% of the survey panel expected activity at their company to be higher in a year's time compared with only 5% expecting a deterioration.</p>
<p>Employment rose strongly again, the eleventh successive increase, reflecting the need to expand capacity in order to meet the current and anticipated further growth in demand for services.</p>
<p>Despite the recruitment of new staff, another sharp increase in the overall amount of work outstanding at panel member companies suggests that the growth in demand continued to run ahead of the expansion of capacity. Outstanding business has risen strongly so far this year in line with the faster growth of new business.</p>
<p>The rise in business outstanding was again partially explained by a lack of suitably skilled personnel. Skill shortages continued to be reported in many service sectors, but most notably for computing positions. The higher wages and salaries necessary to retain existing staff and to attract suitably qualified new personnel led to a further marked increase in costs during May.</p>
<p>In order to maintain profit margins in the face of rising costs, increasing numbers of service companies were reported to have raised their charges. On the whole, prices charged rose for the seventh consecutive month with a modest acceleration in the rate of increase.</p>
<p>However, the ability to raise prices continued to be subdued by strong competition. Thus, although a fifth of all companies reported a rise in costs, only 12% of all companies were able to raise their charges.</p>
<p>INCOMING NEW BUSINESS</p>
<p>An increase in the number of companies reporting greater demand for their services drove the seasonally adjusted New Business Index to a new high of 62.8 in May. In general, panel members attributed the strengthening of demand simply to improving confidence in both the domestic and overseas markets, which they have increasingly met with greater sales and marketing activities. The amount of new business placed each month has risen at a generally accelerating rate since this survey began last July.</p>
<p>OUTSTANDING BUSINESS</p>
<p>The rate of growth in the amount of work outstanding at panel member companies rose again in May. The survey found levels of outstanding business to have risen sharply so far this year, in line with the acceleration in growth of new business. In May, one in four companies reported an increase in the amount of work yet to be completed, many of whom reported an inability to meet the current growth in demand for services due to insufficient capacity. Skill shortages were again cited as a constraint on expansion.</p>
<p>EMPLOYMENT</p>
<p>Growth in the amount of outstanding business, combined with the anticipation of a further strengthening of demand, prompted a significant rise in service sector employment during May. In each month since this survey began, around twice as many companies have raised staffing levels as have cut workforces. Where job losses have occurred, they have generally reflected on-going rationalisation and cost-cutting programmes and have been most prominent in the financial services sector.</p>
<p>PRICES CHARGED</p>
<p>Prices charged by service providers rose for the seventh month running in May, showing the fastest seasonally adjusted rate of growth recorded by this survey to date. The survey found an increase in the number of firms reporting that a strengthening of demand has allowed them to pass higher costs on to customers. However, strong competition continued to restrict the ability of many firms to raise prices, such that only 12% of companies were able to increase their charges in May.</p>
<p>INPUT PRICES</p>
<p>The seasonally adjusted Prices Index rose to the highest level so far recorded by this survey, thereby signalling the sharpest rise in costs recorded. As reported in recent months, rising wages and salaries were the principal cause of higher costs in May, with a shortage of suitably qualified staff again driving wages higher in many sectors (especially computing). May also saw an increase in the number of companies reporting higher charges from suppliers of goods and services.</p>
<p>BUSINESS EXPECTATIONS</p>
<p>Measured overall, business expectations were generally unaffected by the change in government in May. The index remained steady at 83.0 as 71% of all companies anticipated an increase in business activity over the coming year while only 5% anticipated a decline. The expected further improvement is generally believed to be likely to derive from continued strong growth in the UK, especially greater demand from the consumer sector, and the gathering pace of economic growth overseas, particularly in Europe.</p>
<p>NOTE; The survey of 500 executives covers transport and communication, financial intermediation, business services, personal services and hotels and restaurants. Respondents are asked whether business has shown an improvement, deterioration or no change on the previous month. From their percentage replies, an index is derived. A level of 50 indicates no change, a higher number shows an increase or improvement and a lower number signals a decrease or deterioration.</p>
