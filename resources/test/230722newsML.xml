<p>Three judges of Belarus's 11-member Constitutional Court, including its head, resigned on Tuesday amid a growing confrontation between hardline President Alexander Lukashenko and his political opponents.</p>
<p>Chairman Valery Tikhinya quit along with Mikhail Pastukhov and Alexander Vashkevich in protest against Lukashenko's win in a controversial referendum last month which gave him sweeping powers in the former Soviet republic.</p>
<p>"We do not recognise the constitution. We do not believe in it, we do not consider it legitimate and we cannot serve under it," Pastukhov said in a telephone conversation.</p>
<p>"There is no sense in having the court since it will be completely subjugated to the president," he said.</p>
<p>A summit of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which ended in Lisbon on Tuesday denounced the referendum giving Lukashenko, 42, a mandate to rewrite the constitution.</p>
<p>The OSCE said in a statement that the referendum "was conducted in contradiction with constitutional procedures and cannot be considered as legitimate".</p>
<p>In a rare and public rebuke to a participating member, it told Lukashenko to ensure the freedom of the media, re-establish full democratic procedures and start talking to the opposition.</p>
<p>Lukashenko, who also attended the summit in the Portugese capital, shrugged off the criticism and warned the 54-nation OSCE not to meddle in his country's affairs.</p>
<p>Tikhinya presided over rulings by the court against 19 presidential decrees, including one which said the referendum should not be legally binding.</p>
<p>But the court stopped short of impeaching him despite the fact that he ignored their rulings.</p>
<p>Lukashenko, who won the right to appoint half the court through the referendum, said the judges could continue their activities for a "long time" -- as long as they abandoned what he called their political bias.</p>
<p>Lukashenko used the referendum to assemble a lower house composed entirely of his supporters, who promptly passed a law disbanding the old parliament headed by speaker Semyon Sharetsky, symbol of the president's domestic opposition.</p>
<p>"By law a decision to dissolve parliament must be approved by a constitutional majority of 133," Pastukhov said.</p>
<p>"But the new lower house passed the law with a simple majority of 103. So the decision has no legal force," he added.</p>
<p>Pastukhov said they handed their resignations to Sharetsky in line with the old constitution, under which parliament elected the judges 2-1/2 years ago for 11-year terms.</p>
