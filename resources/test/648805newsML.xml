<p>Canadian bonds opened stronger on Tuesday, with spreads to U.S. long bonds narrowing, driven partly by strong foreign interest to buy Canada, analysts said.</p>
<p>"There's a pretty good buzz towards North America from a fiscal standpoint. Given the way the Canadian dollar has weakened off and hasn't really affected the bond market I think people are seeing some value in the long end," said Michael Gregory, a fixed-income economist at Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark rose C$1.01 to C$115.07 to yield 6.813 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond rose 10/32 to yield 6.80 percent. The spread between the bonds narrowed to one basis point from six basis points at Monday's close.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market is now focused on whether the Canadian 30-year bond can trade to yield less than its U.S. counterpart. This would bring the entire Canadian yield curve below the U.S. yield curve for the first time ever.</p>
<p>"There is a big question now as to whether we can push through in the 30-year area. There seems to be some good momentum here, so we could very well see that," said Gregory.  </p>
<p>In other prices, Canada's 10-year benchmark bond rose C$0.34 to C$106.70 to yield 6.332 percent while the U.S. 10-year rose 4/32 to 6.53 percent.</p>
<p>The negative spread between the bonds widened to 20 basis points from 16 basis points at Monday's close.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill yielded 2.88 percent against its U.S. equivalent which yielded 5.0 percent.</p>
