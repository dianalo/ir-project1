<p>The South African Futures Exchange said on Wednesday a record 80 million rand worth of maize contracts had traded this month with volumes boosted by uncertainty about the state of the new crop.</p>
<p>Safex said in a statement over 1,300 contracts had traded since the beginning of February compared with only 214 in January as players became increasingly aware of the benefits of futures trading in the newly deregulated market.</p>
<p>"...(Market) players are increasingly turning to the agricultural futures market as one alternative to manage price risk," said Rod Gravelot-Blondin, the general manager of Safex's agricultural markets division.</p>
<p>Despite an increase in maize acreage, concerns have been raised about the size of the 1997 crop to be harvested from May, as dry and hot weather has continued unabated during the most important growing months.</p>
<p>South Africa's national producers' organisation has said that if rains remained scarce the crop was likely to fall to between 7.0 million and 7.8 million tonnes and could shrink even further, forcing the country to import maize.</p>
<p>Soaking rains last year ensured a bumper harvest of the country's most important agricultural crop of around 9.5 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Maize trading will be completely freed up for the first time from the start of the new season on May 1 following an announcement late last year by Agriculture Minister Derek Hanekom.</p>
<p>Safex's Blondin said open interest in white and yellow maize contracts, the most active of the exchange's farming contracts, stood at over 2,000 contracts.</p>
<p>He said more than 310 million rand worth of maize futures had traded since their introduction a year ago.</p>
<p>At 1145 GMT white maize futures for delivery in March were bid at 705 rand a tonne and offered at 745 rand from settlement at 705. Similar-dated yellow maize contracts were untraded at 610 rand a tonne. --Johannesburg newsroom 27 11 482 1003</p>
