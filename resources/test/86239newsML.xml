<p>French industry leaders voted in a secret ballot on Monday to pick the trade union leader with whom they will work hand-in-hand in managing the strategically important unemployment insurance fund, UNEDIC.</p>
<p>The voting pits Nicole Notat, head of the largest CFDT union, which backs Prime Minister Alain Juppe's controversial welfare reform, against Marc Blondel, head of the Force Ouvriere union (FO), which spearheaded last year's anti-reform strikes.</p>
<p>The vote by members of the CNPF employers' federation began at 1230 GMT and the outcome, expected later on Monday, may have considerable strategic implications to the extent that it affects union unity during a traditionally restive period.</p>
<p>The vociferous Blondel said on Monday morning the vote was sure to go to Notat under pressure from Juppe's Matignon office.</p>
<p>"There's so much political pressure this time, especially from Matignon, that the employers have had to put it to a secret ballot as a way out," he told French radio.</p>
<p>Jean Gandois, head of the CNPF employers' federation, would otherwise have looked as though he was not in control of his own organisation, Blondel said of the vote.</p>
<p>Notat said it was "inconceivable" that the employers choose anyone other than her union. But she warned that her priority was to use an unemployment fund surplus for the benefit of the jobless and not as a pretext for reducing contributions.</p>
<p>"We will not be bought off," she was quoted as saying in one newspaper.</p>
<p>The CNPF decision comes the same day as a strike by teachers against cuts of 2,300 in civil service education staff levels next year under the centre-right government's 1997 spending-cut budget and regional protests by rail workers over jobs.</p>
<p>The autumn period when people return to work and school is traditionally a time of labour unrest but there are few signs for the moment of the kind of conflict or union cohesion behind a crippling 24-day strike last November and December.</p>
<p>Blondel, whose FO union spearheaded those public sector strikes in protest at Juppe's welfare reforms, said his union should have the strategic role in the UNEDIC unemployment fund in the interests of balanced industrial relations.</p>
<p>In July, Notat's pro-reform CFDT union ousted Blondel from another strategic role at the head of the public health insurance fund, the Caisse Nationale d'assurance Maladie (CNAM), a post the FO had held for 30 years.</p>
<p>CNPF president Jean Gandois was due to address the 35-member executive council of the employer's federation before they cast their votes in the secret ballot, with the result expected around 1500 GMT, a CNPF spokeswoman said.</p>
