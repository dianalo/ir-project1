<p>South African police broke off talks with the militant Moslem anti-drugs group Pagad on Tuesday, saying the vigilante movement had now become part of the country's spiralling crime problem.</p>
<p>"As far as the South African Police Service (SAPS) is concerned, Pagad (People Against Gangsterism and Drugs) has degenerated into just another gang and is now firmly part of the crime problem and not the solution...," acting police commissioner Zoli Lavisa said in a statement.</p>
<p>Police said seven policemen were wounded in two separate clashes with Pagad members in the past 24 hours -- the first near Cape Town's international airport on Monday and the second outside a courtroom early on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The clashes followed an unauthorised protest against the drugs trade staged by Pagad members.</p>
<p>Lavisa said police would immediately suspend all talks with Pagad on a national level.</p>
<p>"Pagad has confused fighting crime with causing crime and will from now on be treated accordingly by the SAPS.</p>
<p>"Therefore, the SAPS on a national level will immediately suspend all talks or contact with Pagad until such time as Pagad can practically demonstrate that it is operating within the law," Lavisa said.</p>
<p>National police commissioner George Fivaz's spokesman told Reuters that police were not banning the Moslem group, which came into prominence in August when its members publicly torched and killed a known drug lord and gang leader in Cape Town.</p>
<p>"It doesn't mean a ban. As we say, we'll stop talking to Pagad until they are prepared to act within the law," spokesman Joseph Ngobeni said.</p>
<p>Justice Minister Dullah Omar, himself a Moslem, has failed in negotiations with Pagad leaders to persuade them to abandon their high-profile campaign, which has included attacks on the homes of alleged drug dealers.</p>
<p>President Nelson Mandela vowed last week that Pagad would no longer be allowed to demonstrate with guns and with their faces covered as they did in the past.</p>
