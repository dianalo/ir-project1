<p>Algerian President Liamine Zeroual on Friday vowed to crush what he termed a conspiracy manipulated by foreigners against his North African country after a wave of attacks by Moslem fundamentalists.</p>
<p>In a 20-minute nationwide broadcast on television, Zeroual vowed: "I confirm to the dear Algerian people the determination of the Algerian state to battle against the terrorist groups until their final eradication."</p>
<p>The president's address followed bombs in and around Algiers, and massacres in villages blamed by the authorities on Moslem rebels.</p>
<p>But Zeroual, in a dark suit and flanked by the green and white Algerian flag, said foreigners were involved and wanted to destabilise the country.</p>
<p>"It is bands of criminals, traitors and mercenaries manipulated by external circles who are exploiting their savagery to serve foreign interests," he said, without naming any country or party.</p>
<p>Since January 10, when the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan started, more than 200 people have been killed in bomb attacks on the capital and in massacres near Algiers. The Armed Islamic Group (GIA) had vowed to increase their attacks during Ramadan.</p>
<p>Residents on Friday said the latest massacre was of 15 civilians on a farm just outside the capital on Thursday night. An unconfirmed report circulating in Algiers said another 22 died on an attack on an isolated community on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The GIA is the most radical of fundamentalists who took up arms after the Algerian authorities in January 1992 cancelled a general election which Islamists were poised to win. About 60,000 people have since died.</p>
