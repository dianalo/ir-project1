<p>Slovenian shares were driven over one percent higher on Monday by foreign buying but traders said the market was due for a technical correction after recent sharp gains.</p>
<p>"Demand is still high but today's relatively small gain shows there has already been some profit taking which could lead to a downward technical correction this week," said Zoran Spasinic, a trader at brokerage BPH.</p>
<p>Since January 7, Slovenian shares have surged 15.7 percent largely on the back of tenacious foreign buying.</p>
<p>On Monday, the 10-share SBI index rose 14.6 points to 1,337.4. Overall two shares rose, four were unchanged, 11 fell and eight were untraded. Turnover eased to 385.3 million tolars from 550.4 million on Friday.</p>
<p>Bank SKB was the most actively traded, closing 0.61 percent higher at 49,300 tolars on volume of 3,106 shares for total turnover of 155.3 million tolars.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of interest in SKB due to expectations of their listing on the London bourse," Spasinic said.</p>
<p>SKB said last year it would seek a London listing in early 1997, becoming the first Slovenian company to do so. But the bank still has to gain approval from the Bank of Slovenia.</p>
<p>Ordinary shares of trader Kovinotehna were the top gainers, rising 5.67 percent to 447 tolars on volume of 20,494 shares for total turnover of nine million tolars.</p>
<p>Financial consultancy Primofin was the leading decliner, tumbling 13.06 percent to 18,110 tolars on volume of 26 shares for total turnover of 0.5 million tolars.</p>
