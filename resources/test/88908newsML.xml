<p>The European Commission threatened on Tuesday to seek talks at the World Trade Organisation if Argentina does not lift barriers which are "severely restricting" EU exports of textiles and clothing.</p>
<p>"The European Union will request formal WTO consultations if the matter is not solved within the next few days," the Commission said in a statement.</p>
<p>The EU executive said Argentina had introduced duty rates, labelling and certificate-of-origin rules for textiles, clothing and footwear which went against agreements brokered at the Geneva-based WTO.</p>
<p>It suggested that an urgent meeting be held with Argentinian authorities to sort out the issue.</p>
<p>An Argentinian diplomat in Brussels said that EU officials were expected for talks in Argentina this Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>"If there are problems to discuss then we are ready to talk about them," the diplomat told Reuters.</p>
<p>"What we have to say is that we value our bilateral relations. We hold to our WTO commitments which we feel we have made major efforts to meet," the diplomat said.</p>
<p>He added that that EU textile exports to Argentina grew some 600 percent from 1990 to $6 billion in 1995 while Argentina's balance of textiles trade had gone from a surplus into deficit.</p>
<p>The Commission said the 15-country EU would not hestitate in pursuing WTO action if talks failed.</p>
<p>"Should these negotiations fail the Commission is committed to requesting formal consultations in Geneva and reserves its right to move to WTO dispute settlement, for which it already has the unanimous support of (EU) member states as well as the full backing of European industry," it said.</p>
