<p>Texas Republican Representative Bill Archer says Americans are over-taxed and this week he moved to turn those words into action, leading the crafting of the first major U.S. tax cuts in 16 years.</p>
<p>As chairman of the influential House Ways and Means Committee, his mastery of the tax code is not in doubt. Yet to be determined is whether he has the political savvy and steel to bring together lawmakers with competing priorities to write legislation unlikely to satisfy anyone fully.</p>
<p>Archer, 69, whose task is to fashion a net $85 billion in tax cuts as part of an agreement between the White House and the Republican Congress to balance the budget in five years, announced his detailed proposals Monday, including a capital gains tax cut, a child tax credit and tax incentives for college education.</p>
<p>He acknowledges the tough road ahead. "The challenge in the tax bill is primarily one of trying to fit a double E size foot into a double A size shoe," he said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>A member of Congress from Houston since 1971, Archer toiled on the sidelines for years until the Republicans took control of Congress in 1995. The chairman of the Ways and Means Committee has traditionally been one of Washington's most powerful political brokers, but the style of the Republican leadership in dictating many of the broad policies has whittled away the authority of all the committee chiefs.</p>
<p>The tax cut legislation is Archer's first big chance. The budget agreement between the White House and congressional leaders set out some general instructions on what the tax package should include.</p>
<p>Archer fought off attempts to include more detailed instructions, but he irked some powerful people in the process. House Speaker Newt Gingrich in frustration at one point made an off-hand comment that he could strip Archer of his chairmanship.</p>
<p>But Archer says he senses no rift with the leadership and believes they will back the product of the committee. "My relationship I think is excellent with everyone in the leadership. In the end we all realise we've got to work together and I certainly realise that, and so I feel no friction with the leadership," he said.</p>
<p>Comparisons of Archer and his predecessor, former Representative Dan Rostenkowski, an Illinois Democrat, are inevitable. An old-style Chicago politician, Rostenkowski was known for wielding his clout and cutting behind-the-scenes deals. He was defeated for re-election in 1994 and is now in jail convicted of misusing government money.</p>
<p>Archer, a grandfather of 12 who does his own tax returns, does not accept Political Action Committee contributions and is not shy about showing an independent streak.</p>
<p>"A lot of people remember Rostenkowski at the end, not at the beginning when he took over," said Kenneth Kies, chief of staff at the Joint Committee on Taxation. "No chairman of the Ways and Means Committee starts out as an icon or larger than life figure."</p>
