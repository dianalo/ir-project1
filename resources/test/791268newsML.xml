<p>ASEAN appeared on Monday to be backing away from its support of ousted Cambodian co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh, saying the group had never called for his reinstatement to power in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>Foreign ministers from the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) emerged from four hours of talks saying the nine-member grouping would continue to engage the leaders in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>The ministers also viewed as an internal matter any move to arrest ousted First Prime Minister Ranariddh if he returned home. Hun Sen has said Ranariddh would face trial if he returned.</p>
<p>"We are not here to pass judgement," Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said when asked if ASEAN would make it a condition that Ranariddh not be tried by Hun Sen before general elections in May 1998.</p>
<p>ASEAN had previously said Ranariddh and his supporters should be allowed to return home and resume political activity.</p>
<p>Many ASEAN members are keen for the grouping to include all 10 countries in the region by the end of the year and favour dealing with Hun Sen since his military forces already control the country.</p>
<p>The first step would be to reduce the status of Ranariddh. But the ministers refused on Monday to say if they still recognised him as co-premier of Cambodia.</p>
<p>"We don't recall ever calling for the reinstatement of Prince Ranariddh," Alatas told reporters after the one-day meeting of the nine ASEAN foreign ministers. "We never said so. We never did," he said.</p>
<p>ASEAN postponed the entry of Cambodia into the group in July after Second Prime Minister Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh after two days of heavy fighting in Phnom Penh earlier the same month.</p>
<p>An ASEAN statement then said the group continued "to regard Ranariddh as co-premier of Cambodia".</p>
<p>"The question of recognition or non-recognition does not arise," Alatas said. "Recognition of governments is not the rule with ASEAN. We recognise states."</p>
<p>He said the prince, who recently warned ASEAN about softening its stand against his bitter rival, remained "an important factor in continuing efforts to restore political stability in Cambodia".</p>
<p>Ranariddh has refused to return to Cambodia after fighting flared last month and accused his rival of killing scores of his supporters.</p>
<p>But the ministers said the election in Cambodia of Ung Huot to replace Ranariddh is a development ASEAN cannot ignore and governments around the region will have to deal with the fact that Hun Sen now controls the country.</p>
<p>"We have assessed the situation with regard to the new development, including the election of the First Prime Minister Ung Huot," Alatas said.</p>
<p>Philippine Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon said in a briefing the situation was complicated by any decision that may be taken by King Norodom Sihanouk on the matter.</p>
<p>The monarch has called Ung Huot a puppet and said his son, Ranariddh, was still premier.</p>
<p>But Sihanouk, who reigns but does not rule, also authorised acting head of state Chea Sim to appoint Ung Huot.</p>
<p>ASEAN is apparently pinning its hopes on resolving the impasse in Cambodia by trying to ensure the holding of free and fair elections in the country.</p>
<p>Alatas said ASEAN had received guarantees from Hun Sen that "all political forces can participate" in the May elections.</p>
<p>But he said Hun Sen's position that Ranariddh must stand trial had not changed.</p>
<p>"I do know that we all are firm believers that for the future of Cambodia, it is important to have free and fair elections in May 1998 wherein all political forces may participate," Siazon said.</p>
<p>ASEAN currently links Brunei, Burma, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand.</p>
