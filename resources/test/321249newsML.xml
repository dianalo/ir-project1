<p>Slovenian shares firmed 0.63 percent on Tuesday on low turnover due to a general reluctance to sell actively, traders said.</p>
<p>"Nobady wants to sell because prices are on the rise. But that may not be the right tactics as it seems to me prices are already very high and may not grow much further," said Karmen Cerar, a trader at brokerage Poteza.</p>
<p>* The SBI index rose 8.47 points to 1,345.9.</p>
<p>* Issue A of drug company Lek was the most actively traded, closing 2.67 percent higher at 27,640 tolars on volume of 3,760 shares for total turnover of 103.8 million tolars. -- Marja Novak, Ljubljana Newsroom, 386-61-126-3644</p>
