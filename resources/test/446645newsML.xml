<p>Slovak brokers expressed surprise on Monday after steel maker VSZ a.s. said it planned to acquire a stake in Czech engineering concern Skoda a.s., with speculation rife that a big change in VSZ's ownership could be ahead.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, VSZ revealed it was holding preliminary talks on the possibility of acquiring un undisclosed stake in Skoda.</p>
<p>VSZ is Slovakia's largest steel maker, employing some 25,000 workers. It has some 100 subsidiaries and holds stakes in firms ranging from banks to airlines to soccer teams. It announced a major expansion plan for Eastern Europe late last year.</p>
<p>But brokers said the Skoda announcement came as a surprise to many after a recent increase in VSZ's share price and a higher than usual volume of stock on offer had fuelled market speculation that between 19 and 30 percent of the company could be in play.</p>
<p>"These are two conflicting reports -- one that VSZ continues its purchases, and the other that its ownership could change," ING Barings broker Dusan Sykora told Reuters.</p>
<p>Shares in VSZ, which have led the Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) to a series of year highs, climbed to historic highs of 700-740 crowns from some 600 in early January, with the volume on offer rising.</p>
<p>However, brokers said they were unaware of any big deals in VSZ actually taking place, though 200,000 shares, some 1-2 percent of the company's capital, were currently available on the market.</p>
<p>Some brokers said a large-scale deal would be unlikely to be conducted on the BSE anyway.</p>
<p>"VSZ's share price has risen lately despite the company's steady performance and earnings results. The share seems to have risen to make selling it more advantageous," said an equity analyst with a foreign bank.</p>
<p>"One can only speculate about such VSZ intentions, but it looks quiet probable -- its price has rather been pulled to the 730 crown level by someone who did not appear willing to buy any large volume," Sykora said.</p>
<p>VSZ officials were not immediately available to comment. VSZ is largely owned by its senior management.</p>
<p>On the BSE on Monday, VSZ closed unchanged at 700 crowns with just 1,197 shares changing hands due to the conflicting news and the high price, brokers said.</p>
<p>They expected a near-term cyclical downtrend in VSZ.</p>
<p>"Within its sector, VSZ performance is relatively good if not the best in the region, thus it should only gain, but its (recent capital) activities may raise some questions," said Peter Krutil of Creditanstalt.</p>
