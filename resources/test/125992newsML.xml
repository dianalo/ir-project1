<p>Crude oil futures on the NYMEX ended at a new post-Gulf War high on Friday as cold weather moved in on the northeast U.S., leaving the market in a bullish technical position, traders said.</p>
<p>November crude oil futures on the NYMEX closed at $25.78, their highest since January, 1991 in the midst of the Gulf War. Friday's intra-day high was $25.85, beating the $25.70 post-Gulf War high set last April and matched earlier this week.</p>
<p>Friday's move was a continuation of the bull trend since the end of July, which has been led by heating oil and pushed crude futures up by almost 30 pct, traders said.  </p>
<p>"It's a bullish close," said Rita Beale, an analyst at FIMAT USA Futures.</p>
<p>"We did consolidate all week and had a great close. A number of (fundamental) factors are looking better...(the gains) are not in a vaccuum," Beale added.</p>
<p>"Continued Iraqi tensions, colder weather, lack of government action" combined on Friday to help push the market higher, said Thomas Blakeslee, a trader and analyst at Cargill Investors Service.</p>
<p>The capture of a northern Iraqi town by one of the Kurdish factions from another on Friday suggested that an end to the fighting there was not imminent, ensuring that the Iraqi-United Nations oil-for-food deal designed to allow up to $2 billion of Iraqi oil exports over six months is unlikely anytime soon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, weather forecasters predicted that the cold front which hit the MidWest earlier in the week would move over the northeastern U.S. over the weekend, dropping temperatures to between five and 10 degrees below normal and increasing heating demand.</p>
<p>Heating oil futures lagged crude and gasoline on Friday, probably due to nervousness ahead of a meeting of the Energy Secretary, Hazel O'Leary and oil industry executives to discuss low stocks and the surge in prices.</p>
<p>November heat oil settled at 74.06 cents a gallon, up 177 points on the day and leaving the weekly charts "on the cusp" of maintaining its bullish trend, Beale of FIMAT said.</p>
<p>Gasoline November futures settled up 141 points at 67.94 cents a gallon, with the intra-day high of 68.15 not far off the contract high of 68.75 cents.</p>
<p>Energy's O'Leary said on her way into the meeting that she would ask oil company executives if they had extra refinery capacity to make heating oil, but many attending the talks expected no concrete action. And with U.S. refineries running at between 93 and 95 pct of capacity in recent weeks there doesn't appear to be much room for an increase.</p>
<p>But some market participants expect the market to have trouble holding onto the newly gained ground.</p>
<p>"I don't think it is overly bullish. Historically, crude prices don't like to be above $25. It will have difficulty staying up there without some more bullish news," said Blakeslee.</p>
