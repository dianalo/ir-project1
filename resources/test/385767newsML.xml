<p>Adam Opel AG, the German unit of General Motors Corp, said on Tuesday that about 20,000 workers were affected by work stoppages due to the ongoing Spanish trucker strike.</p>
<p>Opel said production of about 11,000 vehicles had so far been affected by the suspension of work caused by the Spanish strikers preventing parts from being delivered from suppliers.  </p>
<p>After the strike in Spain ends, Opel said it planned to make up the lost production through additional shifts that are allowed through flexible work contracts.</p>
<p>Among individual plants, Opel said production at its Eisenach plant would suspend production of the Corsa vehicle for the night shift on Thursday and the first day shift, affecting 1,000 workers and production of 500 vehicles.</p>
<p>The carmaker also said it would suspend production at its component factory in Kaiserslautern on Friday, affecting about 4,000 workers. But Opel said it would go forward with a planned ceremony to mark the five-millionth engine to be produced at the factory scheduled for Thursday.</p>
<p>Opel said production at its Bochum plant will be suspended from Wednesday through Monday, affecting about 8,000 workers and production of about 4,800 vehicles.</p>
<p>Opel has stopped production last Friday of the popular Vectra saloon at its corporate headquarters plant in Ruesselsheim near Frankfurt and said production would at least be stopped through this Friday.</p>
<p>The work stoppage has prevented some 4,500 of the Vectra saloons from being produced and has affected 3,000 workers.</p>
<p>In addition to the Vectra, Opel said it would cease production of the Omega luxury saloon and its U.S. version, the Cadillac Catera, for Thursday and Friday, affecting production of about 1,200 vehicles and 3,000 workers.</p>
