<headline>Jittery German stocks seen calming - dealers.</headline>

<p>The German stock market is likely to calm before the weekend after a series of shocks took the DAX index down about two percent this week, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the impact of Tuesday's suprising profit warning by software group SAP AG, which triggered a 23 percent slide in the stock, had begun to wane by Thursday afternoon and that the outlook was for a slow recovery.</p>
<p>The 30-share IBIS DAX index was up 5.64 points at 2,684.53 in mid-afternoon dealings, six points ahead of the floor session close at 2,678.43.  </p>
<p>"The main point for me is that there has been no real selling pressure. People have been offloading, but it's been mainly profit-taking," said one Munich dealer, who said he saw the DAX supported around the 2,650-point level.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank's decision to leave rates unchanged came as no surprise to the market and should not create any lasting pressure, dealers added.</p>
<p>Attention was likely to be focused on the banking sector, now into its nine-months earnings season following a report from Deutsche Bank AG on Thursday morning, which had helped it outperform through the day.</p>
