<p>The railways section of Communist-led trades union CGT on Wednesday called a strike on October 17 as part of a day of public sector action against government austerity policies.</p>
<p>CGT said the action would take place from 1800 GMT on October 16 to 1600 GMT on October 18.</p>
<p>The CGT said that SNCF management and the government were slow in putting in place the accords concluded after a wave of public transports strikes last autumn.</p>
<p>It said it blamed management for "reactivating its job reduction policy, reorganisations... and for openly publising its wish to consider suspending the accords obtained in 1995".</p>
<p>Rail workers belonging to the Force Ouvriere union and the pro-Socialist CFDT had already decided to join the October 17 strike, the same day that civil service employees stage a one- day stoppage.</p>
