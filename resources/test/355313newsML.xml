<p>Shares in Swedish television channel TV4 jumped 4.6 percent when trade in the share resumed on Tuesday following news that Swedish media group Tidnings AB Marieberg had acquired a 16.7 percent stake in it.</p>
<p>At 1320 GMT the share traded up 7.5 crowns at 169.5.</p>
<p>Trade in Marieberg and TV4 was suspended before the market opened on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Marieberg said it had paid around 555 million crowns for Swedish insurance company SPP's stake in TV4 as well as TV4 shares from Foreningsbanken's share portfolio, equal to 16.7 percent of capital and voting rights in TV4.</p>
<p>"You can see they have placed a high value on the TV4 share because they have paid 555 million crowns for the stake," one Stockholm-based broker said.</p>
<p>Marieberg edged up two crowns to 220.</p>
