<p>Brady bond prices were mostly unchanged in light trade on Tuesday following the bank holiday weekend but market experts said emerging market debt instruments were expected to outperform U.S. Treasuries this week.</p>
<p>"In times when the U.S Treasury market seems to be relatively flat, and little would seem to upset that this week, the emerging market tends to do better," a Brady bond trader at a U.S. investment bank in London said.</p>
<p>Lack of fresh U.S. economic data this week should allow emerging debt instruments to tighten further against U.S. Treasuries, market sources added.</p>
<p>"We are not meant to get any real sensitive data for the next week so there are some reasonable charts for some emerging market Bradies to outperform in that time as people look to get into some higher yielding paper," said John Davitte, product manager for emerging markets at I.D.E.A.</p>
<p>Of the higher yielding assets, Bulgaria and Ecuador are expected to be among the top performers this week.</p>
<p>Market experts said Bulgaria's smoothe transition from a temporary government to a formal one and expectations for implementation of a currency board should add to further price appreciation in the country's Brady bonds.</p>
<p>Bulgarian FLRBs were 1/4 firmer at 52 bid and the country's discount bonds were 1/8 higher at 68-5/8 bid.</p>
<p>Though Ecuadorean Brady bonds barely trade in London, market sources expect the country's assets to move higher when New York trading opens on news of the approval of President Fabian Alarcon's government in a referndum on Sunday.</p>
<p>Ecuadorean pars  were quoted 1/4 higher at 45 bid and the country's PDI bonds  were quoted 1-1/8 stronger at 63-3/4 bid.</p>
<p>"Overall, it will be a fairly quiet week but with the higher yielders doing particularly well," a trader said. "There is no major negative news on any of our countries so there is very little to upset a steady bull run this week," he added. (**This goes below the sign off**)</p>
