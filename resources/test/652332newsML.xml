<p>World champion Jansher Khan opened his defence of the most lucrative title in squash on Wednesday when he defeated France's Julien Bonetat 15-4 17-16 15-10 in a 48-minute first round match at the Al Ahram International.</p>
<p>Jansher, who celebrated his 28th birthday on Tuesday, spoiled local dreams last year when he defeated Ahmed Barada, the 19-year-old Egyptian squash prodigy, in the final of the $170,000 event, held in the open air in the desert overlooked by the Great Pyramids of Giza.</p>
<p>"I'm here to spoil their fun again if I can," said the top-seeded Pakistani, who now meets England's Paul Johnson, the world number 26, in Friday's second round.</p>
<p>Two lower seeds fell in the early first round session starting with 11th-seeded British champion Mark Cairns who went down 15-13 15-8 15-8 to Amir Wagih, the Cairo-based world number 22.</p>
<p>The 12th-seeded Anthony Hill of Australia also lost in straight sets to Welsh number one Alex Gough, ranked 28th in the world.</p>
