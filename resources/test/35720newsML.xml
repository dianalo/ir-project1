<title>USA: Houston Exploration Q2 profit flat.</title>
<headline>Houston Exploration Q2 profit flat.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-05</dateline>

<p>Houston Exploration Co had second quarter earnings per share of $0.11, unchanged from 1995, a comparison of the Brooklyn Union Gas Co subsidiary's amended preliminary prospectus with its original filing shows.</p>
<p>The amended prospectus reports first half earnings of $2.8 million, or $0.18 per share, compared with $3.0 million, or $0.20 per share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>In May, Brooklyn Union said Houston Exploration's first quarter earnings per share were $0.07, down from $0.09 last year.  </p>
<p>The amended prospectus said the first half profits dropped to $3.9 million from $4.9 million in 1995 as a result of a decline in natural gas revenues of $6.0 million due to hedging activities, higher lease operating costs associated with new properties, and increased general and administrative expenses.</p>
<p>First half production was up 7 percent to 11.74 billion cubic feet equivalent, but this increased natural gas and oil revenues only 5 percent, to $21.3 million, as the hedging left realized natural gas prices 2 percent lower.  </p>
<p>As a result of the hedging, the filing said, Houston Exploration realized an average price of $1.78 per thousand cubic feet compared to the average of $2.31 that otherwise would have been received.</p>
<p>In the first half of 1995, hedging increased natural gas revenues $3.5 million, raising the average price fo $1.81 per thousand cubic feet from $1.47, it noted.</p>
<p>The company also said it has entered into hedging contracts covering an average of 66.3 million cubic feet per day of natural gas production for September 1996 through March 1997 at an average price of $2.04 per million Btu.  </p>
<p>It said similar contracts cover an average of 47.7 million cubic feet daily from April through October 1997 at $1.93 per million Btu and 21.8 million cubic feet daily for November 1997 through March 1998 at $1.91 per million Btu.</p>
<p>In July, it noted, net production averaged 122.2 million cubic feet daily.</p>
<p>Besides reporting actual results, the amended filing disclosed for the first time proforma earnings including Houston Exploration's acquisition of South Texas properties from TransTexas Gas Corp and TransTexas Transmission Corp.</p>
<p>Those properties, along with the Smith Offshore Exploration Co acquisition plant to accompany Houston Exploration's initial public offering, would have boosted first half earnings to $7.7 million, or $0.34 per share.</p>
<p>Revenues would have been $41.6 million, instead of the $21.1 million reported for the first half.</p>
<p>Proforma 1995 results show a profit of $3.3 million, or $0.15 per share, on revenues of $77.0 million. The company had a loss of $303,000, or $0.02 per share, on revenues of $41.2 million last year after a $12.0 million pretax charge.</p>
