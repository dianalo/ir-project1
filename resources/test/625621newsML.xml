<p>* The U.S. auto industry is expected to report that its light-vehicle sales were soft in May.</p>
<p>* More than 700,000 Prudential Insurance policyholdes have indicated they plan to seek restitution for allegedly deceptive sales practices, a number that could cost the insurer more than $1.6 billion.</p>
<p>* Delta Air Lines Inc's board of directors apparently decided not to renew Chairman Ronald Allen's contract this past spring largely because they believed his cost cuts had eaten into employee morale and customer service.</p>
<p>* The Texas Legislature has put a proposed constutional amendment before voters that would life a ban on borrowing freely against home equity.</p>
<p>* European food retailers are urging U.S. grain shippers to identify genetically engineered crops, which some traders fear could hurt soybean and corn exports.</p>
<p>* Nike Inc offered a grim quarterly forecast, citing shifts in order patterns and other factors.</p>
<p>* Zurich Insurance Co is in talks to buy mutual-fund firm Scudder in a deal worth an estimated $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>* The Food and Drug Administration has cleared Coreg as a new treatment for congestive heart failure. The drug is co-marketed by SmithKline Beecham Plc and Boehringer Mannheim GmbH.</p>
<p>* Jenny Craig Inc has settled charges launched by the Federal Trade Commission that it used deceptive advertising, and will now forewarn consumers that weight loss methods are usually only temporary.</p>
<p>* Omnicom Group Inc has offered to acquire Bozell, Jacobs, Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt, an advertising agency. But Bozell's chief executive is said to favor rival suitor, True North Communications Inc.</p>
<p>* McDonald's Corp has dropped a plan to guarantee pushing out orders within 55 seconds of customers having paid for them.</p>

<p>* Credit Markets: That was close. As the dollar tumbled against the Japanese yen earlier this month, hedge funds suffered and many were forced to dump U.S. bonds to cover sizable losses. Now that the dollar has stabilized, many hedge funds and bond investors are breathing a sigh of relief, hoping that the pressure on the U.S. bond market has ended.</p>
