<p>France's highest administrative court, the Council of State, said on Thursday it had suspended controversial midnight curfews for children in two towns.</p>
<p>The Council of State said it had suspended the curfews, which applied to children aged 12 and below, in the northern Paris suburb of Aulnay-sous-Bois and in Dreux, about 55 km west of Paris, pending court rulings on their legality.</p>
<p>It had already suspended a similar restriction in a third municipality, the southern town of Sorgues, in July.</p>
<p>It was unclear when the courts would deliver a decision.</p>
<p>The curfews, established by municipal decrees, had sparked heated debate between France's Socialist-led government, which argued that they infringed personal liberties, and right-wing mayors, who said they were needed to protect children and prevent vandalism during school holidays.</p>
<p>An opinion poll last month found 81 percent of French people favoured child curfews.</p>
