<p>The Australian government on Friday said the regional incidence of anthrax in some dairy herds in the state of Victoria posed no health implications for consumers of dairy or other animal products.</p>
<p>The assurance was given a joint statement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, John Anderson, and the Minister for Health anmd Family Services, Michael Wooldridge.</p>
<p>"While food products remain safe, people who come in direct contact with anthrax affected animals need to be careful and wear protective clothing," Wooldridge said.  </p>
<p>Dairy and other animal products from Victoria remain safe, Anderson said in the statement.</p>
<p>Rapid refrigeration of milk, a standard on-farm procedure, ensures that if anthrax bacteria were in milk from an infected animal it would remain in the vegetative form and be destroyed by pasteurisation at the dairy factory, he said.</p>
<p>Victorian state authorities were imposing an 'eight hour rule' as a special precaution. Milk which leaves a farm within eight hours of a cow showing clinical signs of anthrax was traced and destroyed, he said.</p>
