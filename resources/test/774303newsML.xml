<p>Norwegian holding company Aker RGI ASA said  on Friday its U.S.-based real estate subsidiary Legend Properties,  had been delisted from the Small Cap Market of the NASDAQ exchange.</p>
<p>The delisting comes after Legend was unable to provide an independent  auditor's opinion on its year-end results because of uncertainties  surrounding a class action legal suit.</p>
<p>NASDAQ regulations require an independent auditor's opinion.</p>
<p>On July 24 a Delaware court rejected a settlement in the suit, brought  against Banyan Mortgage Investment Fund, which was bought by RGI U.S.  Holdings in December, 1996. The new firm was named Legend Properties.</p>
<p>The suit claims Banyan's board did not properly review options before  agreeing to the buyout and sought greater value for shareholders.</p>
<p>The court rejected the settlement because it did not believe the named  plaintiffs were adequate class representatives, Legend said in a statement  following the judgement.</p>
<p>Aker RGI holds an 80 percent stake in RGI Holdings, which in turn  owns 79.7 percent of Legend Properties.</p>
