<p>Excite Inc., which runs Internet search and navigation services, Monday launched what it said will be the first free news clipping service available over the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>The new service, Excite NewsTracker, can search a database of more than 300 publications, and can track up to 20 specific news topics on a daily basis or browse broad news categories, Mountain View, Calif.-based Excite said.</p>
<p>NewsTracker is available via Excite's Web site (http://excite.com).</p>
<p>Excite shares jumped $2.25 to $20.50 on Nasdaq after the announcement.</p>
<p>Excite said its clipping database includes publications ranging from Time Warner Inc.'s Sports Illustrated and Fortune magazines to The New York Times.</p>
<p>Free access is supported by advertising, using banner ads common to many Web sites, rather than subscription fees.</p>
<p>The clipping service offers three ways for Web surfers to retrieve articles from news sources -- by customized topics, according to broad news topics and by a simple search.</p>
<p>With each article retrieved through the customized clipping service, a user can click on a "liked it" box which helps the clipping service learn and memorize what articles the subscriber finds most relevant.</p>
<p>To use the clipping service, individuals must enter an e-mail address, a zip code and a password to enable the service to track preferences. The search and browse features are available without registration.</p>
<p>Excite, which has been battling to nail down a solid market position behind Internet search pioneer Yahoo Inc., last year bought Mckinley Group's Magellan Internet Guide and America Online Inc.'s WebCrawler search engine.</p>
