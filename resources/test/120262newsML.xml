<p>Singapore oil products were firm on Wednesday with gas oil climbing higher on news that Esso Singapore has shut one crude unit and the strong gas oil contract on the International Petroleum Exchange, traders said.</p>
<p>The uncertainties over whether the shutdown of Esso's 110,000 crude unit was scheduled or unscheduled, as well as the duration of the shutdown, caused jitters in the market. There were rumours that Esso is facing "tank-top" problems, traders said. Swaps gas oil for November rallied during the day from $29.95/$30.05 to $30.30/$30.40 late in the day and traded as high as $30.35 on the refinery news.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday November swaps traded at $30.05. Physical gas oil was bid as high as $30.50 for a 230,000-barrel cargo lifting Oct 31-Nov 4 fob, 30 cents above the highest deal done this week. A trader offered at $30.90 for the same period. Traders said despite the escalating prices, there are ample gas oil supplies in the region. Some traders said contrary to popular belief, India might take more gas oil cargoes in its December tender. This is because as India has bought few cargoes between September and November, the port congestions should have improved. Traders said bids into Taiwan's gas oil sale tender were around $29.80-$30.00 a barrel, with 10 bids seen.  </p>
<p>Traders said the Esso CDU shutdown should be good news for the jet fuel market, which has been under pressure by abundant supplies.</p>
<p>Fuel oil prices gained $1 a tonne in line with strong crudes. Traders said 180-cst fuel oil for October lifting was indicated between $121-$123 per tonne. A trader said distressed supplies from South Korea were offered at a slight discount to Singapore spot quotes. He said inventories remained high in Singapore. Chinese buyers were sidelined by current high prices while some have already covered their October requirements earlier this month. --Singapore newsroom (+65-870-3084)</p>
