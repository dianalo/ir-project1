<p>British building materials concern RMC Group Plc announced on Thursday pre-tax profits of 295.3 million stg for 1996, down from 324.9 million a year earlier, and unveiled a change in its accounting policy for exchange rate movements.</p>
<p>RMC said it had decided to move to an average exchange rate policy instead of using a year-end figure due to the recent market volatility. If the previous accounting policy had been used, profits would have been 275.8 million pounds, down from 329.3 million. The annual dividend was 26.5 pence per share.  </p>
<p>Explaining the change in its accounting, the group said in a statement it had decided to make the switch so that results were not distorted.</p>
<p>It described 1996 as a "diffifult year". But it added, "the policy of cautious international growth, supported by financial strength and stability, should enable the group to progress in 1997."</p>
<p>Peter Young, chief executive, said this year the UK had seen improved confidence thanks to stronger demand for private housing and in the commercial sector. He said the gorup should reflecting this in its 1997 results.</p>
<p>On the key German market it said, "The group expects that profitability in its German businesses should show some recovery in the coming year, as the restructuring and cost reduciton programme takes effect."</p>
<p>But sluggish activity in many continental European countries is seen continuing through 1997. Israeli operations may be hit by the political uncertainty but the U.S. is seen continuing to show "excellent progress"."</p>
<p>Total group sales for the group in 1996 were 4.55 billion pounds ($7.4 billion) versus 4.54 billion in 1995. ($ = 0.616 British Pounds)</p>
