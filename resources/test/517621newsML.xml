<headline>U.S. Senate passes go-it-alone chemical arms bill.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-04-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Senate on Thursday approved a bill under which the United States would take a unilateral approach to fighting the spread of chemical weapons.</p>
<p>The near party-line vote of 53-44 came shortly after the Senate agreed on plans to debate next week a global treaty outlawing chemical weapons.  </p>
<p>The Clinton administration strongly opposed the bill calling it "a deficient and unworkable alternative" to the treaty, known as the Chemical Weapons Convention.</p>
<p>The bill would ban chemical and biological weapons within the United States and require U.S. sanctions against other countries using them.</p>
<p>It also would require continuing enhancements of U.S. defences against chemical and biological weapons.</p>
<p>Democrats complained the bill had been brought to the Senate without prior consideration, unlike the 1993 chemical weapons treaty which has been ratified by more than 70 countries.</p>
