<p>National Westminster Bank Plc will not bid for mutually-owned life assurer Scottish Amicable, its chief executive Derek Wanless said on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>There had been some speculation in the press that NatWest might make a bid but Wanless, while confirming that NatWest had looked at the possibility, said it could not justify the price.</p>
<p>Scottish Amicable said earlier this month that it wanted formal offers from all interested suitors.</p>
<p>In a letter to policyholders circulated to the news media, Scottish Amicable said that as well as offers from bank Abbey National Plc and insurer Prudential Corp Plc it had also had "expressions of interest" from others.</p>
<p>Abbey National made an initial bid worth about 1.4 billion pounds ($2.29 billion) which was followed by a 1.9 billion pound offer from Prudential a few days later.</p>
<p>Possible international suitors named by market sources include  Australian Mutual Provident and Dutch insurance and banking groups Aegon, ING and Fortis Amev NV. -- Joe Ortiz, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8864.</p>
