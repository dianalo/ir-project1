<p>An expedition seeking to recover the hull of the liner Titanic from the ocean floor abandoned its attempt on Friday, its mission overwhelmed by equipment problems and mechanical failure, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>A 20-tonne piece of the Titanic's steel hull, which had been attached by cables to a recovery ship off the coast of Newfoundland, Canada, fell back to the bottom of the sea, said Erin Purcell of Boston-based Reagan Communications that represents two of the ships used in the expedition.</p>
<p>The piece of hull, lifted from the Atlantic Ocean floor by means of several diesel-filled bags, had been stuck about 200 feet (60 metres) below the water's surface before it fell, she said. Diesel was used because it is lighter than water.</p>
<p>The hull fell as recovery crews were trying to haul it into more shallow water. Several of the bags burst and cables snapped, Purcell said.</p>
<p>The steel-hulled Titanic, thought to be unsinkable, struck an iceberg on April 14, 1912, and sank, killing 1,523 of the 2,200 passengers and crew on board. The wreckage, in water more than 2 1/2 miles (3 km) deep, was located in the North Atlantic Ocean in 1985.</p>
<p>The expedition had tried unsuccessfully several times this week to retrieve the hull but technical hitches and equipment problems caused persistent delays. Expedition members did manage to attach a beacon to the debris that will emit a locator signal for two years, Purcell said.</p>
<p>Some 1,700 passengers including three survivors of the Titanic's doomed trans-Atlantic maiden cruise who accompanied the recovery mission returned to port on Thursday, she said.</p>
<p>Original plans had called for the piece of hull to be taken to Boston on Saturday and to New York on Sunday. New York-based RMS Titanic Inc., which sponsored the project and holds the rights to the debris, had hoped to use the hull as the centerpiece of an exhibition next spring.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based Discovery Channel was planning a documentary about the recovery mission, while NBC television network and Britain's Channel Four were planning to release independent productions about the Titanic.</p>
<p>The recovery effort did have its share of critics among historians and scientists. "Why destroy a grave?" asked Karen Kamuda, vice president of the Titanic Historical Society based in Indian Orchard, Massachusetts, this week. "It's gross.</p>
<p>"You wouldn't sell tickets to a cruise to see the wreckage of TWA Flight 800," she said of the plane that crashed in July and killed 230 people off the New York coast. "Why does it all of a sudden become okay after a couple of generations?"</p>
<p>The historical society, with 5,000 members worldwide, also disputes the historical importance of the findings. "We're not talking about Egyptian or Mayan culture. We're talking about manufactured, 20th-century objects. What do we learn?" Kamuda said.</p>
<p>But Robert Hessler, a professor of biological oceanography at San Diego-based Scripps Institution of Oceanography, said, "The Titanic played such a vivid role in our memories. The objects will remind us of things we've forgotten, differences in how ships are built and differences in lifestyle."</p>
