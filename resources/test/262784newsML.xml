<p>The Taiwan dollar closed unchanged against its U.S. counterpart for second straight day on Tuesday as expected year-end U.S. dollar demand failed to appear.</p>
<p>The local dollar again ended at T$27.493, the same as Monday. Turnover through dealers was only US$54.5 million.</p>
<p>"Today's trade was extremely thin. We traders may have to drive taxis at night to make a living," said one dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers said trading interest had been shrinking as the Taiwan dollar has recently shown no direction.</p>
<p>A narrow T$27.49-27.50 range was seen for Wednesday.</p>
