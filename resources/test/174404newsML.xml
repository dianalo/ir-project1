<p>West Australian Newspaper Holdings Ltd said on Thursday that net profit in the 1996/97 first quarter was A$11.89 million on sales of A$75.69 million.  </p>
<p>Chairman Trevor Eastwood said the weakness in advertising volumes had continued and this was a cause of concern.</p>
<p>The downturn was evident in the 4.5 percent fall in operating revenue in the latest 13 weeks and a 13.6 percent fall in earnings before abnormals, interest and tax to A$21.7 million. Net profit fell from A$14.2 million a year ago, when the quarter consisted of 14 weeks.</p>
<p>Eastwood said the outlook was slightly less buoyant than last year. "However, after taking into account cost reductions and increased revenue, a full year result close to that of last year would seem likely," he said at the annual meeting.  </p>
<p>The newspaper publisher, which dominates the Perth market with its West Australian daily broadsheet, achieved a slight rise in 1995/96 (July/June) net profit to A$47.85 million from A$47.12 million a year earlier.</p>
<p>Annual operating profit rose to A$74.87 million from A$69.38 million.</p>
