<p>Controlling the rapid expansion of internet bandwith should be a key element in Internet service providers' strategy for the future, UUNET Technologies Inc chief executive officer John Sidgmore said.</p>
<p>Now, between 150 and 200 megabits of information per second could pass over the Internet backbone or infrastructure, Sidgmore told the Internet World conference here. Two years out, he projected, 15,000 megabits per second would pass over the backbone.  </p>
<p>Because bandwith costs were about 54 percent of an Internet service providers total costs, Sidgmore said these providers would only survive if they were facilities based with direct bandwith control.</p>
<p>"That's one of the fundamental reasons why we merged with MFS and WorldCom," he said.</p>
<p>UUNET is a unit of MFS Communications Co Inc. In August, MFS and WorldCom Inc announced plans to merge late this year or early in 1997.</p>
