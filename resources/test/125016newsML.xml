<p>Europe's largest forestry group, UPM-Kymmene Oy, a major supplier of paper for the European print media, on Thursday reported an expected slide in profits and was only tentatively optimistic on prospects.</p>
<p>UPM saw a recovery in demand for fine paper, typically the first grade to respond to changes in the business cycle, but was cautious about price prospects. Its chief executive officer still saw pressure ahead on newsprint prices.</p>
<p>"We shouldn't underestimate it," Juha Niemela told a news conference when asked if he saw a risk of newsprint prices falling in 1997. He said the risk was there because prices in Europe were still higher than elsewhere, but did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Media companies like Rupert Murdoch's The News Corp Ltd have pointed to an end to last year's newsprint supply squeeze which pinched their profits. But so far UPM has made higher profits on newsprint with prices still up.</p>
<p>UPM said on some markets it had been forced by oversupply to lower newsprint prices -- hiked by between three and 10 percent in January -- in the summer and prices were still falling slightly.</p>
<p>Group earnings before extraordinary items slid around 41 percent to 2.67 billion markka ($582 million) in the January/August period from 4.54 billion a year earlier -- a result widely in line with market forecasts.</p>
<p>It said it expected profitability in the remainder of the year to be about the same as that for the four months to August -- weaker than in January-April.</p>
<p>Further ahead, it said economic growth was forecast to strengthen gradually in Europe, its main market, which would increase paper consumption.</p>
<p>But it said market pulp prices -- which point the way for fine paper and are strengthening only gently after slumping from peaks last year -- are still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Analyst Mikel Jafs at Swedbank in Stockholm saw encouraging signs in the company's ability to boost its deliveries of fine paper by two percent in January-August, which he said could dampen a coming fall in European newsprint prices.</p>
<p>"The paper market is showing some signs of improvement in the early (cyclical) grades," he said.</p>
<p>His exact view would depend on a company briefing later but he said that before the report he had expected newsprint prices to fall by around 20 percent next year versus 1996.</p>
<p>A major drag came in UPM's biggest magazine paper division, with sales down and operating profit slipping to 1.55 billion markka from 2.15 billion last year. Operating profit in newsprint, at 856 million markka, was above the 792 million earned in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>Group net sales fell to 33.82 billion from 35.62 billion as UPM said demand for many products was noticeably weaker than last year -- when it and its rivals made record profits.</p>
<p>Its hesitant optimism on fine paper was more confidently reiterated by Metsa-Serla Oy, Finland's third-largest forestry group, reporting a more dramatic slump in profit.</p>
<p>Saying profit after financial items fell to 254 million markka from 1.29 billion a year earlier, Metsa-Serla forecast a loss for the last four months of the year, although it said it would make a profit over the full year.</p>
<p>"Market pulp prices bottomed out during the spring and a slight upward trend was visible by the end of the summer," it said. "Prices for fine papers are expected to embark on a modest rise."</p>
<p>But Metsa-Serla, whose sales rose to 9.53 billion markka from 8.64 billion, said the improvement in product prices had not come in time to have any material effect on results for the final four months.</p>
