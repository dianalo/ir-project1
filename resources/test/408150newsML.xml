<headline>THE PROTEUS COLUMN - Trying to gain from GAN.</headline>
<text>
<p>THE PROTEUS COLUMN</p>
<p>It looks like details of the French Government's rescue</p>
<p>plan for insurer GAN will be revealed at 1630GMT today. Analysts are predicting an injection of between 10 billion and 20 billion francs to get the company out of problems stemming mainly from poor-performing property business.</p>
<p>The government already sank 2.9 billion into it in 1995, and wants this to be its last dealing with GAN before privatisation.</p>
<p>The final amount it puts in this time will depend on the kind of close-run equations involved in selling a second-hand classic car. Do you spend a lot of money on restoration to increase the sale value in the hope that you make back more than you spend? Or do you just make essential repairs at less cost, sell for much lower price, and leave the new owner to invest in restoring it and to enjoy the advantages.</p>
<p>The decision-makers will be bearing in mind that it is currently a sellers market, with the wave of consolidation sweeping the insurance industry meaning there is a high-premium on insurance operations with something to offer. As Proteus has pointed out before, both GAN and fellow French insurer AGF are seen as potentially attractive targets for acquisition by other European insurers, and shares in both companies have been swinging up and down as a result.</p>
<p>It may well be that the government decides to sell 30 percent of GAN by trade sale and the rest by public share offer. The property arm and the CIC banking unit would be sold off separately.</p>
<p>The less costly scenario would involve further provisioning of some seven billion francs at the UIC property arm and the Baticredit property defeasance structure and close to three billion francs in technical provisions in insurance. However further more conservative provisioning in non-life and life insurance and more dramatic plans for shutting down UIC businesses completely could push the bill up.</p>
<p>Whatever the government decides, observers will be wary of anything that smacks of window-dressing. The former management at GAN have taken enough flak on the way the company accounts brushed aside property losses. It does not need any more.</p>
