<p>Procter &amp; Gamble Co is aggressively pumping up promotion and advertising for its Crest toothpaste product, which has seen rivals take a bite out of its leading market share.</p>
<p>The consumer products giant will increase promotion and advertising for Crest this year, possibly doubling its marketing revenues, while introducing a new toothpaste product by the end of the year and unveiling another new product next year, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Although Crest still leads toothpaste brands with a 28.1 percent market share, it is at a five-year low.  In 1992, its market share was 34.8 percent.  Colgate-Palmolive Co 's Colgate toothpaste is second with about 19 percent.</p>
<p>Jim Schwartz, a P&amp;G spokesperson, said the company would not disclose its alloted advertising and promotional spending but did suggest that reports of the company's plans to double Crest spending this fiscal year compared with fiscal 1995 were on target.</p>
<p>In fiscal year 1995, ended June 30, P&amp;G spent $40 million on Crest, analysts said.  </p>
<p>"That's really what's needed.  If you have a great product, you really have to get out there and market it.  I'd say that is half the battle," said Carol Warner, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>The first marketing effort is a two-for-one Crest Tartar Control promotion in September, which is aimed at loyal users of an already popular product.</p>
<p>But rivals are not resting either, analysts said, and the imminent launch of Colgate's Total toothpaste is sure to make the already-tight market even more competitive.  </p>
<p>"I think we are going to see a lot of two-for-one deals, a lot of buddy packs and a lot of competitive moves," said Michael Grant, an analyst at JP Morgan.</p>
<p>Wall Street is excited about Total, which already is in 95 countries, because it should send Colgate's U.S. sales skyward and take the company's stock along with it.</p>
<p>Colgate is awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to market Total as a treatment for gingivitis, plaque, tartar and cavities, a claim no other toothpaste can make.  The approval is expected before the year's end.  </p>
<p>"It does just about everything.  It's a real solid product," said William Steele, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>Steele estimated that Total would grab about five percent of the U.S. market in its first year.  Grant said he was not sure it would be that high, but even half that number would garner about $30 million in additional revenues for Colgate, "which is nice," he said.</p>
<p>"Everyone is expecting Total to be a pretty big thing," Warner said. "I think it will do well, but it's not going to blow everything away."  </p>
<p>She said P&amp;G is sure to use all of its marketing force to stave off the Total challenge and push back smaller rivals, who recently have made inroads.</p>
<p>One of the causes of Crest's decline is Mentadent, made by Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever Group, which roared onto the market in 1993 and by the first quarter of 1996 had a 12.6 percent dollar market share.</p>
<p>Also, Warner-Lambert Co's Listerine toothpaste, SmithKline Beecham Plc's Aquafresh Gum Care, and PeroxiCare by Church &amp; Dwight Co Inc have made respectable showings in the market, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Total and the other relatively new products focus on gum care and whitening, which analysts said represent the future for toothpaste marketing.  As as the baby boomer population ages and consumers pay more for these value-added products, the emphasis on gum care makes good strategy.</p>
<p>"I think that gum care is probably a great longer term positioning but it will take education," Grant said.</p>
