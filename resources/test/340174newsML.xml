<p>LIFFE white sugar futures ended little changed in solid activity on Wednesday as steady selling pressure kept nearby values pinioned in tight ranges.</p>
<p>The March/May spread narrowed to 40 cents by the close, when March stood just 20 cents up at $298.00 and May down 10 cents at $297.60.</p>
<p>Volume amounted to a hefty 3,782 lots, boosted by against actuals trades and March/May crosses as the March expiry approaches.</p>
<p>"There haven't been any major trades at all...it's in a very tight range, very much like New York," said one trader.</p>
<p>"I don't think there's enough physical business going on to warrant the market moving much," he said.</p>
<p>Market sources said while March was well supported by trade buyers at around $295.00, gains were likely to be capped by mixed sellers around and just below $300.</p>
