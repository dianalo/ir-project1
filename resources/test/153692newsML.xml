<p>A survey of likely Maine voters showed more support for the so-called forestry compact proposed by Gov. Angus King, which would limit the clearcutting of forests, than the other two options combined.</p>
<p>Strategic Marketing Survey showed that 46 percent of those polled said they will vote for governor's measure, which is on the Nov 5 ballot, along with competing proposals, including one plan to ban the practice entirely.</p>
<p>Of the voters who were surveyed, 22 percent were undecided on the issue when the poll was conducted.</p>
