<p>The United Nations and Congo President Laurent Kabila remain divided over the terms for a U.N. mission to investigate alleged abuses by his troops, the U.N. Secretary-General's spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Fred Eckhardt, spokesman for Kofi Annan, told reporters in Geneva that difficult negotiations continued in Kinshasa with Etienne Mbaya, minister of reconstruction. "There remain a number of sticking points...We haven't given up."  </p>
<p>A U.N. advance team, including Argentine forensic experts who would excavate sites suspected to contain mass graves in former Zaire, has been in Kinshasa for two weeks seeking accord on the terms for the full investigation due to start on July 7.</p>
<p>One of several sticking points is whether Roberto Garreton, a Chilean lawyer who serves as U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the country, will be allowed to take part, according to Eckhardt. In April, Garreton accused the rebels of massacring Rwandan refugees during their push across the region in 1996.</p>
<p>"Kabila is uncomfortable with Mr. Garreton. The Secretary-General wants to see an investigation carried out," the U.N. spokesman said. "Our dilemma is how to reconcile these two competing agendas. The objective is to get the team in."</p>
<p>Annan, on a five-day visit to the U.N. European headquarters in Geneva, will take up the matter later in the day with Ralph Zacklin, acting U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.</p>
