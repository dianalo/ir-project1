<p>Lagardere Groupe declined comment on Friday on a statement from General Electric Co Plc (GEC) that the British company was in talks with Lagardere and Alcatel Alsthom on their bids for defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF.</p>
<p>"We have no comment to make on the contents of the offer," a Lagardere spokesman said.</p>
<p>GEC earlier said it regretted a decision by the French government to rule it out of the bidding in the Thomson-CSF privatisation and said it was in discussions with its French partners Alcatel and Lagardere, which have been admitted.</p>
