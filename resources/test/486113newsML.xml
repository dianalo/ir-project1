<p>Overall, wool prices remained unchanged at Thursday's sale in Christchurch when compared with the previous sale, Wools of New Zealand said.</p>
<p>Prices for fine crossbred and lambs wool improved, while prices for stronger wools and oddments eased back.</p>
<p>The official market indicator was up a cent to 435 NZ cents per kg clean, with strong down one to 373 and lamb up 14 to 398. On offer was 1,878 clean tonnes in 15,916 bales, chiefly comprising 42 percent crossbred fleece, 20 percent lambswool and 20 percent second shear. Passings of wool which failed to meet growers' reserves amounted to 34 percent.  </p>
<p>Compared with last week, crossbred fleece 34 and 35 micron was 3.5 percent dearer, 36 micron was one percent cheaper and 37 micron and stronger was 1.5 percent to three percent cheaper.</p>
<p>Cotts was 1.5 percent cheaper, and second shear generally three percent cheaper. First lambs was two to four percent dearer, while second lambs were one to three percent dearer.</p>
<p>Bulky skirtings were one percent dearer while second shear bellies and pieces were 1.5 percent cheaper.</p>
<p>Main interest came from China, Western Europe and local mills. The next sale is in Napier on April 10.</p>
