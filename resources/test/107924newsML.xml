<p>Colombian stocks slightly lower Thursday in thin trading influenced by the recent rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>Medellin's IBOMED general price index slipped 0.25 percent to end at 13,591.80 on trading of stocks worth 649.1 million pesos. Bogota's IBB index fell 0.14 percent, ending at 871.38 on trading of stocks worth 497.35 million pesos, close to a record low for the year.</p>
<p>"The markets were affected in volume and prices by a week-old trend toward higher interest rates," one Medellin-based broker said in a telephone interview.  </p>
<p>He said many investors appeared to be staying on the sidelines of the equities market because higher interest rates make investments in the fixed-income market more attractive.</p>
<p>The IBB was also dragged down by profit-taking in ordinary shares of blue-chip Banco Ganadero, which fell 1.79 percent to end at 273 pesos per share.</p>
<p>Profit-taking also weighed on Cementos Argos, which dropped 1.47 percent to close at 5,500 pesos a share.</p>
<p>In Medellin, losers were led by Banco Ganadero, which dropped 4.25 percent to end at 270 pesos per share.  </p>
<p>Bavaria SA also fell in Medellin, ending down 0.73 percent at 3,999 pesos per share.</p>
