<p>A surprise announcement by the Philippine Central Bank late on Tuesday to offer reverse repos maturing on April 10 at an increased rate of 10 percent was intended to attract more dollar inflows into the country, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Previously, the Central Bank had been borrowing at an overnight rate of 9.9 percent. It had also been been selling three-day, one-month, and two-month reverse repos at 9.9 percent. percent.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Central Bank may had been prodded to increase rates due to the slowing of inflows for fixed income securities and the threat from a possible outflow of stock market investments.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Philippine Stock Exchange sank to its lowest level in six months. The bourse's main index plunged 2.73 percent, or 81.66 points, to finish at 2,909.30</p>
<p>"It's time for interest rates to correct," an analyst from a big bank said, since overseas funds had been leaving the country due to the low domestic interest rates.</p>
<p>The 91-day Treasury bill rate had remained at a single-digit level for the fourth consecutive week on Monday at 9.583 percent from 9.498 percent. The last time it was in single digits was in September 1995.</p>
<p>"And one pressure is coming from the stock market. That's one way of enticing funds to stay," the same analyst said.</p>
<p>Though the peso had remained stable in the past days at 26.37, the Central Bank had been able to do so by selling dollars at 26.37 and has now resorted to using interest rates, traders said.</p>
<p>"I think the Central Bank doesn't want to sell dollars anymore," another dealer said, even if its gross international reserves remain high. On Friday, the Central Bank sold about $91 million at 26.37.</p>
<p>"We'll see some flows coming back. Banks should see the peso strengthen because of the higher interest rates," another foreign bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Late last week, the Central Bank had started to signal to the market that interest rates should not go lower when it offered six-month reverse repos at a higher-than-market rate of 10.125 percent.</p>
