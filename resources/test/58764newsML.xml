<p>Ireland's pubs, for years the headquarters of a quirky national anarchy, pressed parliament on Tuesday to be allowed to choose their own closing hours.</p>
<p>The Chambers of Commerce, the mouthpiece of shops and businesses, told parliament market forces rather than age-old laws should govern when the nation's 30,000 pubs should be open.</p>
<p>"The Chambers are delighted to note that parliament is taking a serious look at the issue of reform of our licensing laws," chief executive Paul Skehan told a parliament committee.</p>
<p>At present pubs are open around 12 hours a day but usually close at midnight. On Sundays they observe what is called "holy hour," a two-hour closure said to be enforced to allow people to attend Mass.</p>
<p>But closing hours are often flouted. Many pub owners simply lock the doors with the drinkers still inside and pretend to be closed, a practice which is especially hard to police in far-flung rural areas.</p>
<p>Parliament is studying changing the laws after pub owners and some parliamentarians complained that closing hours were anachronistic and puzzled tourists, a key source of revenue.</p>
