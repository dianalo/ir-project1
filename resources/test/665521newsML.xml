<p>Salomon Brothers said on Tuesday it raised its rating on the shares of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp to buy from hold, believing there will be a tobacco settlement.</p>
<p>-- Analyst Diana Temple also said in a research note she believed RJR would have enough cash flow to permit a $1.50 per share dividend if there was a $15 billion payment in the tobacco industry settlement.</p>
<p>-- Talks between tobacco industry representatives and state attorneys general who are suing the industry to recoup the costs of treating diseases allegedly caused by smoking have been going on since early April.</p>
<p>-- "With capital expenditures of $390 million to $300 million, RJR's cash available for dividends could equal nearly $500 million to $727 million," she said.</p>
<p>-- The stock was trading up 5/8 at 34-5/8.</p>
