<text>
<p>Union Pacific Resources Group Inc announced an offshore natural gas discovery in Ship Shoal block 105 in the central Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>The well has five separate productive sands which represent more than 100 feet of net pay. Union Pacific said it is the operator and owns a 58 percent working interest in the well.</p>
<p>Union Pacific plans to spend up to $25 million net to drill as many as three more wells in this area during the third and fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>The new wells will be drilled to test additional potentially productive formations which have been identified by 3-D seismic.</p>
<p>At least one of the new wells will be on an adjacent location owned 100 percent by Union Pacific.</p>
<p>Production facilities are expected to be completed by fourth quarter 1997 in order to accommodate the production from the Ship Shoal 105 well and the pending wells.</p>
