<p>Northwest Airlines said Wednesday it agreed to buy back a 19 percent stake in the company from KLM Royal Dutch Airlines for $1 billion in a deal meant to strengthen their often stormy alliance.</p>
<p>KLM will sell back its holding to Northwest for four annual payments totalling $1.07 billion to $1.17 billion in exchange for a long-term cooperation pact.</p>
<p>The deal, hailed by industry analysts as a welcome resolution to the airlines' lengthy boardroom battle over control of Northwest, could create "the most far-reaching airline alliance ever seen," the carriers said in a statement.</p>
<p>Northwest stock soared on the news, gaining $3.125 to $41.25 on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>The airlines said the new marketing and operational alliance was for 10 years and could be extended to include new partners. KLM also agreed to drop a lawsuit against Northwest that stemmed from a dispute over its ownership stake.</p>
<p>The carriers set one of the first global airline alliances, a practice that has become widespread between U.S.-based and foreign carriers. The alliance allows them to coordinate flights and to funnel passengers, for example, from Northwest's domestic routes into KLM's European service.</p>
<p>"Theirs was basically the first alliance and so far-reaching, they had no choice but to patch up their differences," BT Securities analyst Vivian Lee added.</p>
<p>Officials at the two airlines said the new pact should help the partnership.</p>
<p>"Removing the ownership dispute from the relationship will only enhance our partnership," said Northwest's director of international communications, Douglas Killian. The new pact was reached after 3-1/2 years of talks, he said, noting Northwest will make the payments from cash reserves.</p>
<p>Killian said the operating alliance has added about $50 million to Northwest's annual operating income, an amount that could increase to $65 million this year.</p>
<p>He said the two carriers may integrate their cargo operations. "There is a lot of potential to work together," he added.</p>
<p>In Europe, analysts said that KLM's top priority now was to seek a European partner.</p>
<p>"The most important thing now is to pick up a European partner to boost their market share to the targeted 15 percent," said Frits de Vries, airlines analyst with Gilissen Bankiers.</p>
<p>He said KLM's decision to go ahead with Northwest ruled out the likelihood of a link-up with British Airways, currently awaiting European Union approval for its mega-alliance with American Airlines.</p>
<p>Instead, KLM would likely seek ties with Italy's Alitalia, Northwest's preferred European partnership candidate, he said.</p>
<p>Alitalia also has a strong position in Latin America, a blank spot in Northwest's route network, he added.</p>
<p>The Italian carrier's state holding company said earlier this week that KLM was at the top of its list for an alliance with the financially troubled carrier.</p>
<p>But KLM itself was tight-lipped on potential candidates.</p>
<p>"We never call names in that respect but the intention of both partners is to expand their alliances with other partners ... to come to a global airline system," KLM spokesman Peter Wellhuener told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>While the partnership -- the first-ever trans-Atlantic alliance to gain U.S. antitrust immunity -- has flourished at the level of operations, boardroom relations have been frosty.</p>
<p>The two airlines have bickered for several years, with KLM taking the U.S. carrier to court over a plan that prevented KLM from further boosting its stake.</p>
<p>Northwest has repeatedly charged KLM with seeking to take it over and said the Dutch carrier was a "creeping control threat."</p>
