<p>South Africa needs a separate Insider Trading Act since current legislation is adequate, a government-appointed task force said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Insider Trading Task Group, headed by Mervyn King, said current law was not up to the job of tackling insider dealing since it did not embrace all three financial markets -- equities, futures and bonds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the sanction available for insider trading was limited by statute to a criminal one and there should also be a civil sanction.</p>
<p>South Africa is burdened with a reputation as a haven for insider trading, highlighted by several high-profile cases of trading in company shares ahead of major announcements. Bond traders have also complained about leaks of key economic data.</p>
<p>Presenting his draft report for comment, King said the proposed new legislation would allow for civil action and there would be a mechanism for people suffering loss as a result of an inside trade to receive compensation.</p>
<p>The penalty to be paid by the insider would be three times the amount of the profit gained. Criminal liability would incur a fine of two million rand or 10 years in prison.</p>
<p>Insider trading is already a criminal offence, with penalties of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to 500,000 rand, but there has never been a cofviction.</p>
<p>King said his report -- expected some months ago -- had been delayed due to a debate as to whther the Financial Services Board (FSB) or the Securities Regulation Panel (SRP) was the appropriate body to administer the new law.</p>
<p>All but one member of the committee favourd the FSB, he said.</p>
<p>The recommendations also include remedies which have not existed before, such as a plea bargain with an accused which a court mst accept.</p>
<p>The report said that this followed the example of the Securities Exhange Commission in the U.S. which has dealt with insider trading more successfully than any other country.</p>
<p>Comments on the draft report are invited by June 30, after which the task group will make a final report to the Policy Board for Financial Services and Regulations which will make recommendations to the Minister of Finance.</p>
