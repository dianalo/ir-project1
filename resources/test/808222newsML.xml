<headline>Russian MinFins up on Dow, trend unclear.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-08-19</dateline>
<text>
<p>Russian MinFins edged up on Tuesday in thin trading following a rise in the Dow Jones index and on market optimism about U.S. interest rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>They differed where the market would move in the next few days.</p>
<p>		   tranche    Aug 19		  Aug 18</p>
<p> 1999 maturity   (3)	92.00-92.25	   91.90-92.20</p>
<p> 2003 maturity   (4)	70.75-70.71	   70.40-70.70</p>
<p> 2008 maturity   (5)	53.63-53.88	   53.20-53.50</p>
<p> 2006 maturity   (6)	53.25-53.50	   59.10-59.40</p>
<p> 2011 maturity   (7)	47.38-47.63	   47.15-47.45</p>
<p>"The market edged up in the morning as no negative decision is expected at today's FOMC meeting," a Russian bank dealer said, estimating MinFins rose 0.3-0.4 basis points.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets at 1300 GMT to review monetary policy.</p>
<p>A Western bank dealer said the market nudged up following a rise in the Dow Jones index.</p>
<p>He forecast a price slip in the next few days.</p>
<p>"We shall fluctuate before the market finds a direction," he said. "But it is more likely to fall than to rise as now we are almost at all-time high. Besides, given the nervousness of global markets, clients are unlikely to take risks."</p>
<p>He also said that the Russian 10-year Eurobond was now more attractive than MinFins.</p>
<p>But the Russian dealer said the market would rise by at least 0.5 basis points on positive news likely to emerge from the FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>He said the market could not rise more than 100 basis points, where it would meet resistance, before the news about Russia's rating revision came.</p>
<p>He said tranche 5 rose most strongly as it has a higher yield but shorter maturity than tranche 7.</p>
<p>Tranche 5 has a 10.36 percent yield to maturity, tranche 7 10.33 percent, he said.</p>
