<p>A Northern Ireland policeman was shot and wounded on Portadown's Garvaghy Road early on Tuesday in fresh violence sparked by the routing of a Protestant parade down the same road on Sunday.</p>
<p>Witnesses said the policeman was injured when five shots rang out during disturbances involving Catholic demonstrators. His injuries were not thought to be life-threatening.</p>
<p>He was the second member of the security forces to be shot since the latest upsurge of violence in Northern Ireland began last weekend. A policewoman suffered facial injuries when she was shot in a patrol vehicle in Coalisland, northwest of Belfast, on Sunday.</p>
<p>The attack in rural Portadown was assumed to be the work of Irish Republican Army (IRA) gunmen fighting British rule in Northern Ireland or a breakaway group exacting revenge for the refusal of the authorites to ban Sunday's Orange Order parade.</p>
<p>The wave of violence which swept across the province on Sunday ebbed somewhat after the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, appealed for a "calm and dignified protest".</p>
<p>Police said there were several incidents overnight in which Catholic youths hijacked cars and set them ablaze. Some gunshots were fired at security forces in Catholic West Belfast.</p>
<p>Anger was still running high and threatened to blaze again at the weekend when Protestant organisations hold two flashpoint marches in Catholic ares despite vigorous opposition by residents.</p>
<p>A Belfast reporter, Ivan Little, told a local radio station that he had been invited to a clandestine news conference by heavily-armed Loyalist guerrillas who told him they would defend Protestant areas if attacked by Catholics.</p>
<p>Loyalists are officially observing a truce they called in October 1994 but have been blamed by police for a series of attacks against Catholic targets in the past six months.</p>
<p>They have not been involved in any of the violence over the Portadown parade and it was the first time the guerrillas had been linked to current Northern Ireland tension.</p>
<p>Police were investigating the death of a Protestant youth who apparently died in an explosion in south Belfast but refused to confirm or deny speculation that he was handling a bomb. Some reports said he was a well-known Loyalist.</p>
<p>Britain's embattled Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, said the circumstances surrounding his death were unclear but added: "One death is one death too many. Northern Ireland has seen too much tragedy. Violence solves nothing. It accomplishes nothing."</p>
<p>If the death was linked to guerrilla violence, it would be the first fatality since the worst violence for years engulfed Northern Ireland after police allowed the Orange Order march through a Catholic enclave of Portadown on Sunday.</p>
<p>Mowlam was expected to be questioned about a report that she and her advisers decided three weeks ago to rush Sunday's Orange Order parade down the Catholic Garvaghy Road area of Portadown.</p>
<p>The report, in London's Independent newspaper, quoted a confidential government document as saying the decision was the "least worst option" and contradicted Mowlam's public version that the move was a last-minute decision after mediation attempts failed.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair refused to bury a faltering Northern Ireland peace process sponsored by the London and Dublin governments.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein, political wing of the IRA, urged youths to end riots and car hijackings which turned Irish nationalist ghettos into no-go zones and IRA traps for police and British troops.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams appealed for calm and dignified protest but blamed Britain for igniting the anger.</p>
<p>Martin McGuinness, an elected member of the British parliament and Sinn Fein's chief negotiator, said he was struck on the head by police in scuffles around a Catholic demonstration against a Protestant band parade in Bellaghy.</p>
<p>The march passed off relatively peacefully but Catholic activists said they expected massed opposition on Saturday to a parade down the Lower Ormeau Road of south Belfast, scene of violent clashes in previous years.</p>
<p>The parade takes place on the "Glorious Twelfth", the 12th of July anniversary of a 1690 battle victory by King James over an invading Catholic King which the Orange Order sees as the most cherished date in its calendar.</p>
<p>Mowlam held brief talks on Monday night with leaders of the Orange Order, who are determined they will march down the road despite threats of protest by local Catholic community chiefs.</p>
<p>There was no immediate sign the Orange Order might agree to any rerouting of the March. Jeffrey Donaldson, assistant Grand Master of the Order, said the violence was the fault of Irish nationalists alone and his organisation was not to blame.</p>
<p>"We do try to take on board legitimate concerns. But Orangemen have rights as well, enshrined in international law," he told British television. The Order says it wants only to walk peacefully along public roads which belong to no group.</p>
<p>The Apprentice Boys, another Protestant organisation, is also planning a Saturday parade in Northern Ireland's second city of Londonderry, birthplace of militant Irish nationalism and scene of violent protest over the weekend.</p>
<p>More than 100 people have been injured since Sunday, including two 14-year-old youths, one a Protestant struck by a stray bullet and the other a Catholic hit by a plastic bullet.</p>
