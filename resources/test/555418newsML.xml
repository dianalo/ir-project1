<p>Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila said he abandoned plans to board a South African navy ship on Friday because of security concerns, but said he could still travel there on Saturday for peace talks.</p>
<p>"I am worried about security on the ship," Kabila told a Luanda news conference. "No one has told me about who is there or what their role is."  </p>
<p>Kabila also said he was not happy that the composition of the negotiation group had been expanded without his knowledge.</p>
<p>"...And now I've learned that the president of Congo is on the boat. Now this is a surprise. Everyone knows he is a friend of Mobutu," the rebel leader said.</p>
<p>South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who was meant to escort Kabila to the SAS Outeniqua navy ship for the first face- to-face talks with President Mobutu Sese Seko, was due to return to Luanda to brief Kabila about security measures on the ship, aides said.</p>
<p>Kabila, in reply to a question on how his decision not to attend the talks on Friday would be viewed by the international community, replied: "It is my security I am concerned about."</p>
