<p>Indian soybean prices rose by 50-100 rupees per tonne in central Indian markets on Thursday on good demand from processing plants, traders said.</p>
<p>They said volumes were poor and the undertone strong.</p>
<p>"Arrivals were around 2,500 tonnes today," said a trader.</p>
<p>Soyoil prices were down on higher selling from plants and refineries but trade was dull and the undertone easy, traders said. Soyoil solvent was down by 100 rupees and soyoil refined was down by 200 rupees per tonne.</p>
<p>Soymeal prices were marginally down on limited export demand at higher levels, traders said. Soymeal yellow was $290-291 per tonne in export.</p>
<p>Rapeseed extraction was $112 per tonne for March 15-30 shipment and $110 per tonne for April shipments. Rapeseed extraction was 3,850 rupees per tonne for March 15-30 and was 3,800 rupees per tonne for April delivery. The undertone was steady.</p>
