<p>Lack of dollar demand on Tuesday pushed the Indian rupee up to close at 35.80/81 from the day's opening 35.825/835, dealers said.</p>
<p>The rupee traded at a high of 35.80 and a low of 35.83 in thin trade on Tuesday, they said.</p>
<p>"Quite a dull day...little dollar demand, good supplies," said a dealer at a state-run bank. "Volumes were quite poor."</p>
<p>He said the Reserve Bank of India bought dollars in small amounts at 35.805 rupees.</p>
<p>Dealers said the rupee was steady against the forward dollar in dull trade.</p>
<p>"The holiday mood seems to have gripped the market," said a dealer. "There was hardly any action today."</p>
<p>Dealers said the premia on six-month dollars ended Tuesday at 7.82 percent annualised against Monday's close of 7.76 percent.</p>
<p>There will be no forex transactions on Wednesday as banks are closed for Christmas. Trading resumes on Thursday.</p>
