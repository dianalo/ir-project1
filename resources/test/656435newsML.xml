<p>California joined the list of states suing the tobacco industry to recover the cost of health care for smoking-related illnesses, the state's attorney general said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Attorney General Dan Lungren said the suit seeks to recover medical expenses of about $433 million incurred by the state for each of the past three years.</p>
<p>The suit was filed in state court in Sacramento, Calif., making California the 37th state to sue the tobacco industry to recover such health costs.</p>
<p>"This is no slam dunk," Lungren said. "We believe these claims are supported by the evidence but will require great effort to prove."</p>
<p>California alleged in its lawsuit that the industry suppressed research that could have led to the development of safer tobacco products. It also claimed cigarette makers concealed evidence from law enforcement officials.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is also seeking a minimum of $500 million for the practice of unfair competition, including the marketing of tobacco to minors.</p>
<p>Lungren announced the lawsuit after Gov. Pete Wilson signed legislation amending a 1987 state law that had shielded tobacco companies from product liability suits.</p>
<p>"Today marks a significant milestone in California's ongoing efforts to stop smoking," Wilson said.</p>
<p>"The human cost of smoking is all too familiar. Who among us has not lost a loved one to cancer, emphysema or a heart disease?" he said. "There is a heavy financial toll as well for taxpayers, including those that have never taken a puff."</p>
