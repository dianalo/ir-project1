<p>It has taken nearly 20 years but the full story of the lonely death of Steve Biko, apartheid's most celebrated martyr, is about to be told.</p>
<p>During his life Biko gained local prominence as a torchbearer of black consciousness in South Africa, but it was his brutal death at the hands of security police inquisitors that made him a world-renowned icon of the anti-apartheid struggle.</p>
<p>One of the few black activists to rival President Nelson Mandela in fame and stature, Biko was thrust into the limelight after his death by the film "Cry, Freedom" and rock star Peter Gabriel's haunting anthem, "Biko".</p>
<p>He lived for only 30 years. But his death and the subsequent official whitewash focused world attention on the brutality with which South Africa's white rulers were enforcing apartheid.</p>
<p>It also boosted the cause of those trying to isolate Pretoria with international sanctions and stiffened the resolve of black leaders to one day topple the hated regime.</p>
<p>The decision of the security policemen who killed Biko in 1977 to come clean 19 years after the event marks one of the biggest successes yet for South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which has been working for a year to expose human rights violations of the apartheid era.</p>
<p>The commission says the men involved are offering to give a full account in return for immunity from prosecution.</p>
<p>It did not name the officers, but the identities of five white policemen who interrogated Biko in cells in the Eastern Cape city of Port Elizabeth are already well known.</p>
<p>At the time, they told a public inquest there had been no beatings or torture. Biko sustained a head injury when they had to restrain him after he "went berserk" and attacked them during questioning, the officers said.</p>
<p>Evidence at the inquest showed that after receiving the head injury a dazed and incoherent Biko had been thrown naked and manacled into a police van to be taken to prison hospital in Pretoria, about 1,200 km (700 miles) away.</p>
<p>He died of brain damage a few days after arriving there.</p>
<p>The magistrate in charge of the inquest ruled that no one could be held responsible for his death, but the verdict was universally derided and only added fuel to the outcry sparked by the gruesome inquest details.</p>
<p>Then-police minister Jimmy Kruger caused further outrage when he said of Biko's death: "It leaves me cold." But Kurger was quickly forced to drop the glaring lie that Biko had gone on a hunger strike and starved himself to death.</p>
<p>Biko was born in Eastern Cape province in 1946 and became president of the blacks-only South African Students Organisation in 1968.</p>
<p>He was among the founders of the Black People's Convention, an umbrella group for black consciousness movements, and preached the message that South Africa's blacks had to throw off their fatalistic acceptance of apartheid.</p>
<p>The government first acted against him in 1973, slapping him with a "banning" order restricting his movements and preventing him from being quoted in public.</p>
<p>He was detained without charge for varying periods in the following years, until Port Elizabeth security police arrested him for the last time in August 1977.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 people flocked to his funeral and hundreds more were turned away by police roadblocks. Diplomats from 13 Western countries attended.</p>
<p>Biko's aim of black majority rule was achieved in April 1994, when Mandela's government took power. One of its priorities was setting up the truth commission, mandated to heal the wounds of apartheid through confession and catharsis.</p>
<p>Biko was the 46th person to die in police custody since 1963, when laws were introduced allowing detention without trial. Many of the other deaths went largely unremarked.</p>
