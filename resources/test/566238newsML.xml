<p>Israel's ambassador to Washington said on Wednesday political pressure on the Jewish state could be behind a press report that a senior U.S. official had been passing highly sensitive information to the Israeli government.</p>
<p>Israel officials rejected as a "complete fabrication" a Washington Post report that the FBI was probing the alleged Israeli attempt to obtain a secret American document.</p>
<p>Israeli Ambassador Eliahu Ben Elissar, asked if the timing of the report could be linked to a fresh mission by President Bill Clinton's Middle East envoy Dennis Ross, told Israel's Channel One Television:</p>
<p>"That's exactly what worries me. That's the truth. Since I know there's no truth to the story itself, then why just now, and in such a sensational and bombastic manner.</p>
<p>"There's apparently someone who wants not only to smear Israel but, perhaps, also to harm Israeli-U.S. relations. There is also, perhaps, someone here trying to pressure the state of Israel, and in such a wicked manner." He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>The United States is Israel's main ally. Relations between the two countries were strained 12 years ago when a Jewish U.S. naval intelligence officer was caught passing information to Israel. The officer, Jonathan Pollard, pleaded guilty to spying charges in 1986 and is now serving a life sentence.</p>
<p>Relations have been further tested by Israel's right-wing government, whose hardline policies have sparked a deep crisis in U.S.-sponsored peace talks with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Quoting sources with direct knowledge of the inquiry, the newspaper said the FBI investigation was launched in January after the National Security Agency intercepted a communication between a senior Israeli intelligence officer in Washington and a superior in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>The communication referred to someone codenamed "Mega" and an attempt to obtain a sensitive American document, according to the report. The Post said U.S. officials believed Mega may be someone in the U.S. government who provided information to the Israelis in the past.</p>
<p>The Post's sources said the new investigation was focusing on U.S. officials who would have had access to the document, a secret letter of assurances given by then Secretary of State Warren Christopher to Palestinian President Yasser Arafat after successful negotiations to withdraw Israeli troops from most of the West Bank city of Hebron.</p>
<p>In the intercepted communication, the Israeli intelligence officer was said to have informed his superior that Ambassador Ben Elissar had asked him whether he could obtain a copy of the letter Christopher gave to Arafat on January 16, the day after the Hebron accord was signed.</p>
<p>Ben-Elissar told Israel Radio: "It is first-class nonsense, one of those things that falls on us probably from a sick imagination."</p>
<p>He added: "Israel does not collect intelligence in the U.S. and this is a terrible report whose purpose is to accuse Israel of spying against the U.S. This is unimaginable and terribly severe. We do not spy in the U.S."</p>
