<headline>Post Properties sees more rentals in late 97.</headline>
<dateline>ATLANTA 1997-01-29</dateline>

<p>Post Properties Inc Chairman John Williams said the company expects to post better rental -- same-store -- numbers as 1997 progress because there is an oversupply in the Atlanta rental market currently.</p>
<p>Williams made his comments in a press statement that accompanied the company's fourth-quarter earnings.</p>
<p>He said the oversupply should be absorbed as the year progresses. He did not make an estimate regarding the company's 1997 same-store figures. A spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
<p>The company develops and rents properties in the U.S. Southeast. It said its same-store revenue rose 1.9 percent for the fourth-quarter of 1996, compared with a year earlier.</p>
