<p>Dwindling arbitrage opportunities for foreign crude intake to the U.S. has kept markets quiet again on Wednesday, crude brokers said.</p>
<p>U.S. refiner interest is high for distillate-laden crudes, like Forcados, but the economics of bringing West African and North Sea barrels to the U.S. is a non-starter.</p>
<p>"There is not much room to act," said one trader, noting West Texas Intermediate/Brent numbers showed spreads well below $1.00 for both the November and December months.  </p>
<p>In other moves, traders said Colombia's Ecopetrol sale tender for one cargo apiece from November-January of South Blend crude was heard sold for a trader for Peru. Brokers did not reveal the price of the deal.</p>
<p>Ecopetrol's other tender for two Vasconia cargoes closed Wednesday. The two cargoes are slated to load November 3-7 and November 10-14, and are about 500,000 barrels each.</p>
<p>Ecopetrol had asked potential buyers for Vasconia, a heavy crude valued around WTI minus $1.90-$2.00 a barrel fob on a spot basis, to have their bids in by Wednesday.</p>
<p>For the U.S. aftermarket paper Brent, a trio of outright deals were featured, as three full cargoes sold for December Brent from 5-15 cents over the IPE December Brent settlement price at $23.75.</p>
<p>Traders said December Brent was sold at $23.90, $23.85 and $23.80, all bought by a Wall Street player.</p>
<p>Another two spread deals were confirmed, both at plus 46 cents for November/December inter-month trades.</p>
