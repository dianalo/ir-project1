<p>The Mauritius bourse index ended Friday slightly down by 0.15 points to 364.28 in a mixed market which is on the outlook for fresh news, brokers said.</p>
<p>Volume totalled 19.37 million rupees on 1,051,720 shares from 10.96 million rupees on 401,951 shares on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The only leading shares on the move today (Friday) were Rogers, Air Mauritius and Sun Resorts. Although all three of them rose, this was offset by falling prices of smaller companies," one broker said.</p>
<p>Conglomerate Rogers climbed 50 cents to 96 rupees on 28,000 shares, national carrier Air Mauritius edged up by 10 cents to 44 rupees on 22,785 shares and hotel stock Sun Resorts gained 40 cents to 38.90 rupees on 232 shares.</p>
<p>"This type of mixed market shows a lack of general trend. This demonstrates that it (the market) is hungry for fresh news," the broker added.</p>
<p>Share prices in the banking sector were stable on Friday, Mauritius Commercial Bank at 83 rupees on 32,278 shares and State Bank of Mauritius at 11 rupees on 721,000 shares.</p>
<p>State Bank's traded volume accounted for around 40 percent of the day's total and foreign investors were seen trading on the bank's shares on Friday.</p>
