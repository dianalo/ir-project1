<p>A leader of Portugal's Neves Corvo copper workers said there would be no fresh strike over working hours provided the company did not impose Sunday working unilaterally and kept discussing working conditions.</p>
<p>He spoke to Reuters by phone after the first two shifts at the mine, covering a majority of the workers, had voted to rejected a company proposal for implementing continuous working.</p>
<p>"While there is dialogue, there will be no fresh strike," union leader Eduardo Lazaro told Reuters.  </p>
<p>A third shift of workers will vote on the proposal this evening but Lazaro said there was no doubt about the outcome. He said unions and management had a meeting already scheduled for July 23 but his could brought forward if management requested it.</p>
<p>Somincor, the state-controlled company that operates the mine, had improved its offer for miners to accept Sunday shifts at the site, where ore yields have been falling steadily.</p>
<p>But the first two shifts rejected the offer as insufficient on Thursday. The third shift will vote around 2200 GMT.  </p>
<p>Lazaro said miners, who struck for five days last week over the issue of Sunday working, were prepared to accept the principal of continuous operations but management needed to improve its offer further.</p>
<p>He warned that a strike at the 107,000 tonnes per year mine could not be ruled out if the company sought simply to impose its will again.</p>
