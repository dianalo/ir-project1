<p>Likely voters in Los Angeles favor Mayor Richard Riordan over challenger Tom Hayden by a 2-to-1 margin, according to a poll published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Times poll found Riordan leading state Senator Hayden 54 percent to 26 percent among likely voters. Twenty percent said they have yet to decide who they will support during this spring's municipal elections.</p>
<p>Fifty-seven percent of those polled said they approved of the way Riordan was handling his job, while only 22 percent said they disapproved. Last summer, just 46 percent of residents gave the mayor a favorable rating.  </p>
<p>The Times said at least some of Riordan's strength ahead of the April 8 primary can be attributed to perceptions about the local economy. Fifty-two percent of residents surveyed said they felt things were going well in their city, while 44 percent felt they were not.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted Wednesday through Sunday by telephone, surveyed 1,143 city residents, including 854 registered voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, the Times said.</p>
