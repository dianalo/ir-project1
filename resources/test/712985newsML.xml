<p>A bill regulating the opening up Brazil's telecommunications industry to the private sector faces one final vote in Congress after clearing three Senate committees Tuesday, an official said.</p>
<p>The committees finished voting on the General Telecommunications Law when they rejected a series of proposed amendments to its text, the official said.</p>
<p>The bill must now be approved on the floor of the Senate. Government whips said they would put forward a motion later Tuesday which would allow that vote to take place Thursday.</p>
<p>The bill paves the way for the privatization of the federally owned Telebras system by setting down rules for how the telecommunications sector will operate in a competitive environment.</p>
<p>The bill does not set any limits on foreign capital in Brazilian telecommunications operators but gives the president of the republic powers to limit non-Brazilian investors on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>The law would also create a new regulator and set down rules for private companies operating in the sector.</p>
