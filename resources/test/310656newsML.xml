<p>Finnish inflation was 0.6 percent on average in 1996, down from 1.0 percent the previous year, and the slowest since 1954-1955 when deflation reigned, Statistics Finland said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Last year's rise in consumer prices was the smallest since the mid-1950s when the figures were deep in the red," an SF official said by telephone.</p>
<p>Earlier, SF said December CPI was flat month-on-month and rose 0.8 percent year-on-year -- both in line with forecasts.</p>
<p>Lower interest rates, cheaper used cars, coffee, local phone calls and television sets contributed to keep inflation slow.</p>
<p>Components working in the opposite direction were petrol, apartment, cigarette and electricity prices as well as rents, SF said in a statement.</p>
<p>In December, Finland's EU-harmonised CPI gauge showed a year-on-year rise of 1.5 percent, up from 1.4 percent in November when Finnish EU-harmonised inflation was the third lowest in the 15-nation EU block, it said.</p>
<p>A further harmonisation of baskets of consumer goods and methods of collecting data is being introduced in all European Union member states this year.</p>
<p>Harmonised inflation data will be used when EU leaders decide in spring 1998 which countries may enter the planned third stage of Economic and Monetary Union due to begin in January 1999.</p>
