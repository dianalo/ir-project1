<p>Frankfurt, Germany's financial capital, beat bids from Berlin and Munich for the show. The VDA said it could not award the show to either city because they were not able to offer suitable dates.</p>
<p>The 1997 car show will take place in Frankfurt between September 11 and 21, 1997 while the next truck show in Hannover is scheduled for September 5 to 13, 1998.</p>
<p>The IAA car show is one of the world's oldest, dating back to 1897 when it was held in Berlin. Frankfurt has hosted the show regularly since 1951.</p>
