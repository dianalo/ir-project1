<p>Poultry numbers have increased sharply in the UK following the mad cow scare and this should result in higher cereal use in animal feeding, the Home-Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Publishing the June census figures -- annual estimates of livestock numbers in the UK -- the HGCA said poultry numbers were some eight million higher than the previous year's flock at 133 million as consumers substituted beef with white meat.</p>
<p>"The extent of the rise is somewhat surprising. For example, the 600 percent increase in the Welsh breeding flock, adding more than one million head to the total UK estimate, is much higher than expected," the HGCA said.</p>
<p>With cereals constituting 50-60 percent of poultry rations, as opposed to less cereal in cattle rations, the consumer shift to chickens would result in a higher cereal usage this season, the HGCA said.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Agriculture in October estimated the usage of wheat in feed at 5.8 million tonnes in 1996/97, up from 5.1 million last season.</p>
<p>The June census recorded a a relatively stable UK dairy breeding herd of around 2.5 million heads. But a fall in dairy cow numbers was expected to resume by the end of the year following continued pressure from milk quotas.</p>
<p>It said the extent of the contraction for the overall cattle herd, forecast by the Meat and Livestock Commission at 3.5 percent by December, was difficult to predict given the uncertainty surrounding the government's selective cull policy.</p>
<p>The total UK pig herd was estimated at 890,0000 head, slightly higher than last year's figure.</p>
