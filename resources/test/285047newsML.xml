<p>Napoli coach Gigi Simoni bemoaned the death of the "beautiful game" on Friday as he prepared his team for another display of old-style Italian soccer.</p>
<p>Simoni has brought a sparkle back to the game -- and the crowds back to the San Paolo stadium in Naples -- by shunning the zonal play that has become the mark of Italian soccer for more traditional individual flair.</p>
<p>The result -- Napoli lie third in serie A, behind Vicenza on goal difference and six points adrift of leaders Juventus.</p>
<p>They travel to Fiorentina on Sunday in their drive to win a championship that has eluded them since the glory days of Diego Maradona, who captained Napoli to their only two titles in 1987 and 1990.</p>
<p>"I defend the soccer of the past not out of tradition but because it represents what I believe in," Simoni, who came to Napoli from Cremonese this season, told Gazzetta dello Sport.</p>
<p>"If you kill fantasy it's a bit like killing soccer. You imprison it, make it boring and empty the stadiums," he said.</p>
<p>"Our job is to entertain. Soccer is not just about someone who's good at drawing diagrams on a blackboard. It's not in the hands of draughtsmen of strategy and tactics, a line here, a cross there.</p>
<p>"When I was a boy I fell for a sport that had fantasy, that got you excited about a move, a touch of the ball, the way the game sang. That's my kind of football," Simoni said.</p>
<p>Simoni will have all his players available for Sunday's game but could leave Brazilian midfielder Beto out of the side as punishment for a late return to Naples from Christmas at home.</p>
<p>Newspapers reported on Friday that the player also faced a 15 million lire ($1,000) fine for his unauthorised two-day absence.</p>
<p>Fiorentina are looking for their second successive win at home after beating Cagliari 2-0 on December 22 before Italian soccer stopped for the Christmas and New Year break.</p>
<p>Owner Vittorio Cecchi Gori has told the eighth-placed club that he expects three wins in a row from their opening games of 1997.</p>
<p>Midfielders Stefan Schwartz and Sandro Cois are both suspended but the foreign trio of Argentine Gabriel Batistuta, Sweden Kennet Andersson and Portugal's Rui Costa are all available.</p>
<p>"The game against Napoli is difficult and important," Batistuta said. "It's a new year and we have to get off on the right foot."</p>
