<headline>AEP Industries closes Massachusetts plant.</headline>
<dateline>HACKENSACK, N.J. 1996-10-24</dateline>

<p>AEP Industries Inc said Thursday it ceased manufacturing operations at a plant in Massachusetts, resulting in the elimination of 320 jobs during the next four months.</p>
<p>The company said it also would eliminate an additional 40 administrative and sales positions, most of which are based at the plant in North Andover, Mass.</p>
<p>The plant was formerly part of Borden Inc's global packaging division, acquired by AEP earlier this month. The plant manufactures pallet wrap and polyvinyl chloride film products.  </p>
<p>The company said its other facilities have "ample capacity" to serve customers formerly supplied by the North Andover plant.</p>
<p>AEP said it expected the plant closing will save about $18 million in the 1997 fiscal year. It did not anticipate any further plant consolidations in North America.  </p>
<p>AEP spokeswoman Catherine Feeney said the company plans to take a charge for costs related to the layoffs, such as severance pay. The charge will be taken "in the next four months."</p>
<p>It was not immediately known how large of a charge the company would take, she said.</p>
