<p>NWE gasoline prices eased slightly following its recent gains and with lower crude and gasoline futures, traders said. Premium unleaded barges traded at $236.50 and $237 fob ARA, down from $238 on Monday, and regular unleaded slipped about $1 to trade at $229. Traders said swaps prices eased about $2.50 with Nov trading at $228 and Dec trading at $209.50. Total said on Tuesday a 24-hour strike by some workers at its Gonfreville and Dunkirk refineries did not stop production. Traders said news late on Monday of the strike had little impact on prices. -- John Hanley, London Newsroom +44 171 542 8185</p>
