<p>India's largest steelmaker said on Monday it was exploring buying a stake in an Australian coal mine in what analysts said was an unusually bold foray by a state-owned firm.</p>
<p>The state-run Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) said it had begun talks with the British Coal Corporation to buy the British firm's 14.8 percent stake in Australia's Golden Creek Mine.</p>
<p>"We are talking to them," a SAIL spokesman told Reuters by telephone. "They have given us some rather sketchy information. We have asked for more."</p>
<p>Confirming a report in Monday's Economic Times newspaper, he said the preliminary talks could help SAIL enter a long-term arrangement to meet the coal needs of its steel plants.</p>
<p>Another SAIL official, who did not want to be identified, said the steelmaker needed to ensure a steady supply of good quality coal and faced sourcing problems with state-run Coal India Ltd (CIL).</p>
<p>"We require about 15 million tonnes of coal (every year), and we get nine from CIL and the balance from Australia and New Zealand," the official said.</p>
<p>On CIL's coal, he said: "We are having a lot of problems. Not only in pricing but also in ash content."</p>
<p>SAIL officials say a high ash content adversely affects the efficiency of steel plants, and the company needed to look for international alternatives to improve its functioning as it had plans to emerge as a major global player.</p>
<p>SAIL, state-run power plants and the Indian railways are among the biggest users of coal in India.</p>
<p>India is expected to produce 300 million tonnes of coal in 1996/97 (April-March). It produced 270.45 million tonnes in 1995/96.</p>
<p>SAIL reported a net profit of 12.22 billion rupees ($341.3 million) in 1995/96 after 11.29 billion rupees in 1994/95, producing 10.54 million tonnes of crude steel and 9.45 million tonnes of saleable steel after 10.3 million tonnes of crude steel and 9.1 million tonnes of saleable steel in 1994/95.</p>
