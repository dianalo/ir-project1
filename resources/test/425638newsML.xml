<p>A Pennsylvania court Wednesday vacated the state insurance commissioner's approval of the controversial restructuring of Cigna Corp.'s domestic property-casualty business.</p>
<p>Barring a successful appeal, the court's decision means Cigna must return to state regulators for a new hearing and must win the approval of an impartial adjudicator for its transaction to take effect.</p>
<p>In a 5-1 decision, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court ruled that the state insurance department failed to comply with administrative laws protecting policyholders' interests in the case.</p>
<p>Cigna's restructuring, which split the company's property-casualty business into two units, was approved by the Pennsylvania insurance commissioner last year.</p>
<p>Under the restructuring, Cigna created one unit for the profitable, ongoing property-casualty business and a so-called runoff unit for the unprofitable, discontinued business.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania insurance department said it was reviewing the case and had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>Philadelphia-based Cigna said it considered the court's decision flawed and will appeal to the state supreme court.</p>
<p>The restructuring has met with opposition from both policyholders and competitors.</p>
<p>"It is a resounding victory for policyholders," said John Ellison, a partner with Anderson, Kill &amp; Olick P.C. in Philadephia, who has been representing a group of policyholders.</p>
<p>"Cigna is back to where they were on the day before the commissioner issued her decision, which is an unrestructured company," said Ellison, who said he represents a group of 12 policyholders, including Quaker Chemical Corp., pharmaceutical Pfizer Inc. and aerospace and technology firm Textron Inc.</p>
<p>The court ruled, however, that the insurers that opposed Cigna's restructuring have no standing in the case.</p>
<p>American International Group Inc., Chubb Corp., St. Paul Cos Inc. and a group of policyholders strongly opposed the restructuring, citing concern that the runoff unit might not have enough capital to pay future claims.</p>
<p>Cigna said, however, that its 1996 financial results show that its forecasts have been on target and that the runoff unit had more than enough revenue to meet obligations and was able to strengthen reserves for policyholders.</p>
<p>The company said business at its property-casualty operations would continue as usual with no disruption.</p>
<p>It was not clear who the adjudicator would be, but the court ordered that the formal hearing take place at the state insurance department.</p>
<p>The court's decision gives the policyholders the right to question Cigna and present their own witnesses in any new hearing on the restructuring.</p>
<p>Opponents of Cigna's restructuring had been barred from cross-examining Cigna in a series of informational hearings held by regulators before the approval and had been limited to 15-minute presentations.</p>
<p>They also objected to Pennsylvania Insurance Commissioner Linda Kaiser's involvement in the case because Kaiser had been Cigna's senior counsel from 1985 until 1992.</p>
<p>Kaiser declined to remove herself from the case.</p>
<p>The court's decision, coming a day after the Home Insurance Co. was placed under state supervision in New Hampshire, may mean trouble for Cigna, an industry source said.</p>
<p>"The combination of the court ruling and the Home falling apart are going to be very bad for Cigna," he said.</p>
<p>Home Insurance, the principal subsidiary of Home Holdings, went into a runoff in June 1995 when it ceased writing new business. A troubling decline in capital at Home's runoff unit prompted New Hampshire regulators to place it under supervision, a move that falls short of an outright liquidation.</p>
