<p>Italian debt markets held the day's gains of around 60 basis points as dealers squared books going into a long weekend in Italy.</p>
<p>Dealers said bond markets were generally a little nervous but had recovered some poise after selling yesterday although volumes were thin as the start of the year got underway.</p>
<p>March Btp futures gained 70 basis points to 128.00 with support at 127.30 and resistance up at the 128.00 area.</p>
<p>The July 2006 Btp was 54 basis points higher at 108.35 and was yielding 7.64 percent with the spread over the benchmark 10-year Bund 169 basis points.  </p>
<p>News late Thursday Italy's budget deficit was provisionally 138.50 trillion lire in 1996, way beyond the revised 123 trillion government target, made little dent on sentiment.</p>
<p>Instead, dealers said the market was watching for progress in discussions on settling a long running pay dispute between metal workers and employers. Formal talks are expected to resume with Labour Minister Tiziano Treu on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Then, dealers say, the market is hoping the Bank of Italy with move to ease interest rates, a prospect which is keeping the market buoyant.</p>
