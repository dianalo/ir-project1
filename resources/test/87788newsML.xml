<p>The dollar on Tuesday lost a little of the steam it had generated recently, while major bourses put on a mixed performance in early European business, with only London showing much progress.</p>
<p>Investors, meanwhile, took flight from precious metals and gold hit its lowest level for 18 months.</p>
<p>With interest rate concerns very much on investors' minds, markets focused on September data for the U.S. National Association of Purchasing Managers (NAPM) index at 1400 GMT.</p>
<p>The NAPM figures, leading up to Friday's key U.S. September jobs data, will provide the latest clues on the next move in U.S. rates.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency hit 2-1/2 year highs against the yen on Monday, boosted by more signs that Japan's economic revival was faltering and the gap between U.S. and Japanese interest rates was widening.</p>
<p>The dollar showed a limited decline from its highs on profit-taking after key Japanese Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara denied that he had said Japan was unlikely to raise rates until the end of March 1997.</p>
<p>"We have seen some profit-taking but most of it has been overnight," said one London bank dealer.</p>
<p>After comments by Finance Minister Wataru Kubo that he supported a strong dollar, not necessarily a stronger dollar, an official of his ministry said Kubo's comments did not mean Tokyo did not want the dollar to rise further against the yen.</p>
<p>"I think the Japanese authorities don't want to rock the boat. They want the dollar to stay around these levels," said Tim Fox, treasury economist at Standard Chartered Bank. "It helps the profitability of Japanese companies and helps foster the economic recovery."</p>
<p>Gold traded around $377.20 an ounce, down from Monday's London close of $378.60. Other precious metals slipped lower in its wake.</p>
<p>For European stock markets, Wall Street gave a slight lead overnight, with the Dow Jones industrial average of blue-chip shares ending up 9.25 points to 5,882.17 but short of a new all-time high after a late sell-off in technology stocks.</p>
<p>A higher-than-expected British September purchasing managers index -- 53.4 against a forecast 51.9 -- brought London stocks down from their highs but they still showed good progress in quiet morning dealings.</p>
<p>"This market's more likely to go up rather than down - the most important reason being there is cash around. We've seen buying of good quality blue chips on any signs of weakness," said one senior London trader.</p>
<p>German shares fluctuated narrowly up and down in early business, affected by the dollar's movements, but dealers predicted calm trading dominated by a "wait and see" attitude.</p>
<p>French shares narrowed opening losses as the market digested Monday's sharp gains of more than one percent. Traders said the market was consolidating and there was no real move to sell.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 0930 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading around 111.15 yen and 1.5245 marks, below Monday's late European levels of 111.52 and 1.5255.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 0930 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was up 26.9 points at 3,980.6.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was down 3.42 at 2,129.39.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index of key German shares was up 5.97 at 2,657.82.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold traded around $377.20 an ounce, down from Monday's London close of $378.60. Silver eased to $4.85, down two cents.</p>
