<p>Japanese shares were steady to firmer in late trading on Tuesday as investors hunted for value amongst issues that have been pushed down recently, dealers said.</p>
<p>Bank stocks attracted most interest, with shares in Fuji Co Ltd (Hokkaido) up about five yen from their close in Tokyo and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd adding about 10 yen from the Tokyo finish, they said.</p>
<p>"But, overall it's quiet. We're very much in the summer doldrums," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 50 was up 2.74 points to 1,588.01 at 1354 GMT in London.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 index gained 148.72 points to 19,853.89.</p>
