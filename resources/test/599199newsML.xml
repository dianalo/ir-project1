<p>The Swiss Federal government on Tuesday launched a 20-year bond, a move aimed a creating more liquidity in the long end which will also benefit the swap market, said Peter Thomann, head of the Swiss Treasury.</p>
<p>"Basically we have the intention of keeping the maturity spectrum as broad as possible," he said in a telephone interview with Reuters.</p>
<p>"We are also interested in having the swap market extend beyond 10 years. We are helping a bit with that," he said.</p>
<p>Thomann said the Swiss swap market for longer maturities is gradually being built up in the area beyond 10 years.</p>
<p>Terms for the latest offering will be set on Thursday. The new bond has a 4-1/4 percent coupon, with the allocation limited to a maximum one billion Swiss francs.</p>
<p>It is the longest maturity to be launched by the Swiss government since two 25-year bonds were set in 1986 and 1987.</p>
<p>Those offerings are relatively illiquid.</p>
<p>One Swiss bond trader believed the government had set unattractive terms on its new bond to keep demand down.</p>
<p>"There is no real interest. The government doesn't need much money. I don't expect much demand for the issue," he said.</p>
<p>But Thomann said investors may be drawn by higher yields offered by longer maturities. The yield on the new bond was quoted in the grey market at 4.23 percent.</p>
<p>By contrast, the benchmark June 4-1/2 percent 2007 10-year bond yields currently just a bit more than 3.50 percent.</p>
<p>Based on current relatively low Swiss interest rates, "I don't expect that we will be sorry in future that we borrowed in a longer maturity," Thomann said.</p>
<p>The offering should also draw long-term investors, he said.</p>
<p>"For investors (the new bond) is also not unattractive, if one believes that interest rates in 1997, 1998 and possibly 1999 will only rise slightly," he said.</p>
<p>The Swiss Federal Treasury's previous auction in March comprised a three-year, and a 17-year tranche.</p>
<p>Thomann noted the offerings drew equal demand.</p>
<p>He said those who bought the 17-year tranche "have no need to complain. They paid 98.50," he said. The outstanding 17-year bond was quoted on Tuesday at 101.00/101.50.</p>
<p>Thomann said the Treasury's relatively low need for liquidity gave it some leeway to experiment.</p>
<p>Swiss government borrowing so far this year has totalled roughly 2.24 billion francs on a gross basis, not including redemptions. In addition, there was a further 350 million taken up for the Treasury's own coffers.</p>
<p>According to plan, the Treasury would need to average 550 million francs per bond auction for the remainder of 1997.</p>
<p>But the Treasury was flexible, Thomann said, adding late last year, for example, it was one billion francs below plan.</p>
