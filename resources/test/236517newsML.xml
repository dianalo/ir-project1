<p>South Africa's serious savings constraint could only be overcome if government's macro-economic plan was implemented, the Reserve Bank said in its quarterly bulletin released on Thursday.</p>
<p>The bank said the lack of sufficient domestic saving was one of the factors preventing the South African economy from growing on a sustainable basis at a rate of more than 2.5 to 3 percent a year.</p>
<p>"It would appear that growth beyond this range leads to unsustainable deficits on the current account of the balance of payments," the bank said.</p>
<p>South Africa's current account deficit for the first three quarters of 1996 stood at 10.5 billion rand compared with a revised 10.16 billion rand in 1995.</p>
<p>The bank said that in view of the fickleness of foreign capital movements, it remained risky to rely for too long on the inward movement of interenational capital to augment domestic saving.</p>
<p>"To overcome this serious savings constraint on South Africa's long-term economic growth and prosperity, it is important that government's macro-economic strategy..., with its strong emphasis on raising saving and improving macro-economic stability, be implemented," the bank said.</p>
