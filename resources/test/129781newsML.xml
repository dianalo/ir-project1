<p>Imo Industries Inc said on Monday it had lowered its expectations somewhat for 1996.</p>
<p>"Looking ahead, we expect 1996 to be a good year for our company, with higher sales and respectable earnings. However, weakness in demand for our Power Transmission products, coupled with the continued weakness of the European market, causes us to lower our expectations somewhat for the full year,"said Chairman and Chief Executive Donald Farrar.  </p>
<p>The company said in a statement that net income for the third quarter ended September 30 was $0.8 million or $0.05 a share, compared to a net loss of $4.7 million or $0.28 a share in the third quarter of 1995. Last year's third quarter included a loss from discontinued operations of $6.9 million or $0.41 a share.</p>
<p>"Imo continues to benefit from previous actions taken to consolidate operations, reduce operating expenses, and expand our customer base," Farrar said.</p>
