<p>A Miami attorney Tuesday filed a lawsuit on behalf of Florida viewers of the Evander Holyfield-Mike Tyson world heavyweight title bout, saying Tyson unfairly took a bite out of their wallets as well as his opponent's ears.</p>
<p>Florida residents paid up to $49.50 to watch Saturday's bout live from Las Vegas on pay-per-view cable and satellite. It ended in the third round after Tyson was disqualified for twice biting Holyfield's ears, having taken a chunk out of his right ear with the first bite.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed by attorney Philip Mandina in a Dade County Curcuit Court demanded their money back.</p>
<p>"What Tyson did to Holyfield was disgusting and what he did to viewers was disgusting," said plaintiff Joseph Mandina, who is the Philip Mandina's son.</p>
<p>"Some might say we haven't a prayer in suing, but I'd say we stand a better chance of getting back our chunk of change than Holyfield does of getting back his chunk of ear."</p>
<p>The suit says that by his actions Tyson deprived viewers who paid to see a legitimate bout.</p>
<p>Philip Mandina said he did know how many Floridians were among the millions of people worldwide who paid to see the fight but "we sincerely hope we get the judge's ear."</p>
