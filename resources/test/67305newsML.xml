<p>European Commissioner Yves Thibault de Silguy said on Friday he was optimistic on prospects for European growth, with recovery in countries like Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark helping pull the others up.</p>
<p>"I am optimistic," he told reporters ahead of a meeting of European Union finance ministers here, adding that he expected "a gradual acceleration in growth".</p>
<p>Growth in some member states "will have the effect of pulling up the whole of Europe," he said, citing Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Belgium.</p>
<p>He also said that he saw no reason to think that the European Commission's economic forecasts due in November would be very different overall from those made in May.</p>
