<p>The number of tourists visiting Slovenian holiday resorts in the first six months of the year increased by nine percent compared to the same period in 1996, the Slovenian Statistical Office said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The number of foreign tourists jumped by 18 percent to 407,338, while the number of domestic tourists remained unchanged at 353,582, the office said in a report.</p>
<p>"I think this year's income from tourism will be around $1.3 or $1.4 billion," Natasa Pobega, assistant to the tourism secretary in the economics ministry, told Reuters.</p>
<p>In 1996 income from tourism in Slovenia rose to $1.22 billion from $1.08 billion the previous year.</p>
<p>Pobega attributed the increase in revenue mainly to a hefty rise in the number of foreign tourists since the end of the war in the former Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>She said the majority of foreign tourists came from Austria, Italy and Germany. -- Novica Mihajlovic, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
