<p>The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) said on Wednesday it would propose its bank supervision department director, Tibor Kasiak, for government approval as a new governing board member.</p>
<p>"NBS Governor Vladimir Masar will present a proposal next Tuesday to appoint Tibor Kasiak as another new member to the bank board, and the last vacant seat on the board should be filled in the near future," bank spokesman Ivan Paska told Reuters.</p>
<p>He declined to say who the candiate was.</p>
<p>Paska added that former deputy finance minister in charge of capital markets Jozef, appointed to the board on Tuesday, would become a director of a soon to be established "Chamber of the Governor's advisers".</p>
<p>Paska declined to specify the activities or powers of the chamber, or to comment on the possible effect the ongoing board changes would have on the NBS monetary policy.</p>
<p>Local bankers have been watching for signs that appointment of new board members by the government could reduce the NBS's independence and lead to a loosening of its tight monetary policy.</p>
<p>Leading government officials have repeatedly criticised the NBS's tight policy, which was further strengthened at the end of 1996 after the government approved a fiscal deficit of 3.7 percent of GDP for this year, compared with a 0.4 percent surplus in 1996.</p>
