<p>The Bank of England, acting fast to establish tough anti-inflationary credentials after the Labour government gave it control over monetary policy, raised interest rates on Friday to 6.5 percent from 6.25.</p>
<p>Exactly one month after it was unexpectedly given the freedom to set interest rates, the bank's new monetary policy committee raised the cost of borrowing to prevent rampant consumer spending from refuelling inflation.</p>
<p>Economists said the rate increase, which followed a quarter point rise last month, could herald steadily rising home loan costs for millions of Britons in the months ahead.</p>
<p>The bank, which has been calling for higher interest rates all year, said recent economic data had not changed its view that monetary policy needed to be tightened.</p>
<p>"It believes that this action to tighten the monetary stance, taken with the aim of meeting the government's inflation target, offers the best chance of achieving continued growth in output and employment at a sustainable pace."</p>
<p>The Halifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender, led commercial banks in raising mortgage rates by 0.35 percentage points to 7.95 percent.</p>
<p>The pound firmed half a pfennig against the mark but later eased back, while London share prices rose further.</p>
<p>It was the first time since the central bank was nationalised in 1945 that it had changed interest rates without being instructed by the government.</p>
<p>Finance minister Gordon Brown astounded financial markets within days of taking office last month by ceding the right to set interest rates to the bank, saying he wanted to free monetary policy from short-term political considerations.</p>
<p>British governments have often been accused of manipulating interest rates for political reasons, especially in the run-up to elections. Previously, the bank could only give advice on monetary policy.</p>
<p>Some economists saw the rate rise as reassuring evidence that the central bank was determined to crack down on inflation.</p>
<p>Underlying inflation was 2.5 percent in April, exceptionally low by Britain's historical standards, but the bank argues that it would rise in the next 18 months if unchecked.</p>
<p>"There were some fears that since all the bank had done until now was advise, it may have been timid about acting once it got power," said Andrew Snowball, UK economist at the Cooperative Bank. "That clearly is not the case."</p>
<p>But leading business groups and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) were disappointed.</p>
<p>"Short-term inflation pressures in the economy at present are subdued," said Kate Barker, chief economist at the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).</p>
<p>"We remain concerned about the impact of higher interest rates on sterling, at a time when many exporters into Europe are experiencing a sharp squeeze on their profit margins."</p>
<p>Barker said she would have preferred a rate increase to be delayed until after Brown presents his first budget on July 2. She urged the government to make "small tax rises to dampen down the consumer sector a little bit".</p>
<p>The British Chambers of Commerce described the decision as a further blow to Britain's hard-pressed exporters and echoed the CBI's call for higher personal taxes.</p>
<p>John Monks, general secretary of the TUC, expressed concern about the impact of higher rates on competitiveness and jobs, saying: "We don't think the rise in interest rates was needed to meet government inflation, employment and growth objectives."</p>
<p>The monetary policy committee is chaired by Bank of England Governor Eddie George, an inflation hawk. At present it comprises three other central bank officials and four outside members, two of whom had votes at the two-day inaugural meeting.</p>
<p>The bank has previously acknowledged that policy-makers face a dilemma. Higher interest rates mean the pound, which has already gained nearly 20 percent in value against major currencies since last summer, could appreciate further, making life even tougher for British exporters.</p>
<p>However, the monetary committee appeared to have been swayed more by a boom in the services sector, which accounts for two-thirds of gross domestic product (GDP), and by a possible huge boost to consumer spending this year.</p>
<p>This will take the form of windfalls totalling at least 30 billion pounds ($48.8 billion) for millions of Britons as building societies and insurance companies turn themselves into public companies. ($ = 0.615 British Pounds)</p>
