<p>Russia is selling air-defence missile systems to Iran, the Washington Times reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The reported sales would be an apparent violation of a pledge President Boris Yeltsin made to block new sales of Russian arms to Iran.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that Iran planned to give a small Russian-made anti-aircraft missile to Hizbollah guerrillas, the pro-Iranian group based in Lebanon.</p>
<p>It quoted intelligence sources as saying that in talks over the past two months, Russian arms dealers offered to sell up to 500 advanced "Igla" anti-aircraft missiles worth over $50,000 each at discount prices.</p>
<p>The sources identified the missiles as SA-18s.</p>
<p>The Times said that other deals between Russia and Iran included the sale of T-72 tanks and Mi-17 transport helicopters.</p>
<p>Yeltsin promised U.S. President Bill Clinton in 1994 to block all new conventional arms sales to Iran.</p>
