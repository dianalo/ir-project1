<p>Power restrictions which have cost Western Australia millions of dollars in lost production and caused thousands of workers to be laid off are set to continue after power workers voted on Friday not to return to work.</p>
<p>The 24 coal handlers at Muja power station about 200 km south west of Perth have also authorised their union, the Construction Forestry Mining and Energy union, to launch a High Court challenge to a return-to-work order issued against them on Thursday by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.  </p>
<p>CFMEU spokesman Gary Wood said the challenge was based on the argument that the stop work was "a political protest by individual citizens excercising their constitutionally guaranteed right to protest reprehensive legislation".</p>
<p>"When they first went out it was because they were violently opposed to the (the Labour Relations Legislation Amendment Bill) and the government has refused to withdraw it," Wood said.</p>
<p>"They have been responsible throughout. They have said they will guarantee to supply sufficient coal to satisfy the Western Australian public but Western Power says it wants all of its power generation capacity," he said.  </p>
<p>Western Australia's new Labour Relations Legislation Amendment Bill introduces a number of changes to the state's industrial relations laws including compulsory pre-strike secret ballots and limitations on political donations.</p>
<p>The power restrictions have been in force since midnight Tuesday and apply to all consumers in the heavily populated south-west corner of the state as well as the gold mining region around Kalgoorlie.</p>
<p>Before Friday's vote the Western Australia Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the state's peak employer body, said the dispute had already cost millions of dollars in lost production.  </p>
<p>"If the workers don't go back to work we really have got a serious situation on our hands," CCI chief executive Lyndon Rowe said.</p>
<p>"We have got companies losing productivity and companies - like agricultural chemical manufacturers - for whom this time of the year is crucial," he said.</p>
<p>He said employers had made "a real attempt" to keep workers at work but thousands of workers had had to be stood down.</p>
