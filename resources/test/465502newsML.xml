<p>Wheat futures prices started a long-awaited downward movement on the Budapest Commodity Exchange (BCE) on Tuesday, traders said.</p>
<p>"It was not today's price drop, but earlier increases that were surprising," said Janos Szolyka of Swap. "Both domestic fundamentals and international prices warranted today's correction."</p>
<p>Milling wheat prices dropped 200 forints to 400 forints per tonne on Tuesday, and finished at 24,410 forints for May, 22,000 forints for September and 23,150 for December.</p>
<p>Szolyka added that current wheat prices, especially on the physical market, are prohibitively high for export although excess stocks stand between 500,000 and 900,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Feed barley prices also dropped on Tuesday, partly led by milling wheat and partly speculation driven, he said.</p>
<p>"A couple of market players can afford to play with the price as they have stocks to back them up," Szolyka said, adding that the market had little fundamental information about this year's crop outlook.</p>
<p>Maize futures rose slightly by some 100 forints for the old (1996) crop and went 200 to 400 forints higher for the new (1997) crop but few contracts changed hands.</p>
<p>"There was little actual trade, so most price movements were of a technical nature," Szolyka said.</p>
<p>Total grains turnover was 253.9 million forints or 605 contracts of which milling wheat accounted for 316.</p>
<p>Lot size= 20,000 kgs</p>
<p>($1=176.58 Hungarian forints)</p>
