<p>The Colombian government threatened to declare a limited state of emergency on Monday to break a week-old strike by judicial workers that has paralysed the country's court system.</p>
<p>The threat came after chief prosecutor Alfonso Valdivieso said the strike could force authorities to free all criminals whose court dates have been missed so far, causing "judicial catastrophe."</p>
<p>"The national government has demonstrated its willingness to negotiate, but we can't negotiate eternally," Labour Minister Orlando Obregon said. "The government cannot allow the paralysis of the justice system to continue."</p>
<p>Justice Minister Carlos Medellin said President Ernesto Samper was studying the possibility of declaring a limited state of emergency that would allow him to decree measures that would force judges and court workers back to work.</p>
<p>Medellin did not spell out what those measures might be, saying only that the government still hoped to reach a negotiated settlement of the work stoppage.</p>
<p>About 40,000 judicial workers across Colombia went on strike on Jan. 20 to protest against the government's decision to limit public sector wage hikes this year to an average of 13.5 percent, despite higher-than-expected inflation last year of more than 21 percent. The judicial workers demand an increase of at least 18 percent over 1996.</p>
<p>Unions representing other public sector workers across Colombia have set a Feb. 11 deadline for an indefinite, nationwide strike to protest against the 13.5 percent ceiling on pay rises.</p>
