<p>Russia's new envoy to Chechnya told separatist leaders in the breakaway region that he would honour the peace agreement reached by his controversial predecessor, but disagreements remain over the deal.</p>
<p>Ivan Rybkin, the mild-mannered former parliament speaker who took over as secretary of Russia's Security Council from outspoken general Alexander Lebed this month, said he would implement the August 31 peace accord to the letter.</p>
<p>"I want to say clearly that consistency in the work of the Security Council will be ensured," Rybkin told former rebel commander Aslan Maskhadov and two other leading separatists at a meeting in a region neighbouring Chechnya.</p>
<p>His words were apparently aimed at reassuring Chechen rebels who feared that the deal reached by Lebed, and later criticised by Moscow, was still valid despite Lebed's dismissal.</p>
<p>The pact, which ended 21 months of fighting in which tens of thousands of people were killed, involved the withdrawal of Russian troops from Chechnya and a pledge to defer a decision on the region's political status for five years.</p>
<p>But both sides have stuck firmly to their public positions on Chechnya's status, with Russia insisting that the region can never split away and the rebels repeating the independence declaration made by their late leader Dzokhar Dudayev in 1991.</p>
<p>Rybkin met the separatist Chechen leaders near Nazran in the Ingushetia region bordering Chechnya after they attended a Congress of Chechen People on Sunday which was told there could be no compromise on independence.</p>
<p>"We must seek peace and agreement by all means with all peoples, but bear firmly in mind that Chechnya's freedom and independence cannot be subject to bargaining," rebel leader Zelimkkhan Yandarbiyev told the congress.</p>
<p>The congress agreed to back Yandarbiyev in a regional presidential election and set a date of January 27 for the poll.</p>
<p>Moscow has said little about these election plans, which have sidelined the Chechen government installed by Moscow at the start of the conflict and now virtually ignored.</p>
<p>Maskhadov, usually dressed in military fatigues, wore civilian clothes for his meeting with Rybkin, underlining his new role as prime minister of an interim government set up by the separatists which Moscow has yet to recognise overtly.</p>
<p>The question of a Russian troop withdrawal appeared to be the most pressing issue. A source at Rybkin's meeting with the separatists said the rebels repeatedly tackled him over the continued presence of Russian soldiers in the region.</p>
<p>The troops, sent to Chechnya by President Boris Yeltsin in December 1994 to crush the region's independence drive, are being gradually pulled out under the deal Lebed signed before he was sacked.</p>
<p>Moscow now says it wants to leave two divisions behind, but the separatists say Lebed agreed they would also be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Tim Guldimann, a Swiss diplomat trying to help peace negotiations, agreed that this was an outstanding issue.</p>
<p>"I think that both sides are admitting that there is a problem. I think that it will be the subject of further steps of the talks," he told NTV commercial television.</p>
