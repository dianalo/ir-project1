<p>Iraq has bought 150,000 tonnes of U.S. hard red winter wheat at a delivered price of $194 per tonne, and may have bought another 50,000 tonnes for $193.50 per tonne, European grain traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The wheat was bought at a tender specifying July shipment and is part of Iraq's purchases under an oil-for-food pact with the United Nations.  </p>
<p>Four companies were involved for 50,000 tonnes each, with three offering at $194 including transport and the other at $193.50 per tonne, traders said.</p>
<p>"Two hundred thousand tonnes has possibly been done but not all of it has necessarily been confirmed by the Iraqis," said one trader.</p>
<p>Iraq had originally been looking for 50,000 tonnes but a drop in world prices may have helped boost the volume, traders said.</p>
