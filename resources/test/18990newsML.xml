<p>The South African government is drafting interim legislation that will include a mechanism to cap municipal budget increases, a senior official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Deputy director general of provincial affairs Andrew Boraine told a parliamentary portfolio committee the Finance Ministry would be given formal authority to cap the percentage increase in municipal expenditure.</p>
<p>"It's for the interim period. In the white paper we are working on, we will look at a much more thorough budgeting system and the issue of zero-based budgeting will come up there," he told Reuters later.</p>
<p>Boraine said the measure would be part of bridging legislation likely to be published next month to determine the form and detail of local government until parliament approves a policy on town and rural management in a white paper due next year.</p>
<p>"The proposal is to formalise the way in which, every year, the Minister of Finance sets limits to how big an increase local governments can have on budgets in percentage terms.</p>
<p>"It's part of the mechanism to achieve macro-economic stability in terms of spending, part of the way of dealing with expenditure in the whole country," he said.</p>
<p>Provincial budgets are determined by the national government, but local authorities raise up to 80 percent of their own finance and fall outside the direct fiscal control of parlaiment.</p>
<p>Boraine said the Minister of Finance would be authorised to set national growth limits separately for local government expenditure on capital and consumption items.</p>
<p>Municipalities would be free to juggle expenditure between separate consumption items, such as salaries and services, but would have to keep the aggregate increase under the prescribed ceiling.</p>
<p>One effect would be to impose limits on wage and salary negotiations, he said.</p>
<p>Boraine said it would be important to have the legislation in place before next year's wage bargaining round.</p>
