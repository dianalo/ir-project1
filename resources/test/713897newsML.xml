<p>Ryder System Inc said in a statement on Tuesday that the period for federal anti-trust review of its previously announced sale of Ryder Automotive Carrier Services Inc and RC Management Corp to Allied Holdings Inc has expired without further action by U. S. government regulatory agencies.</p>
<p>The proposed sale is still contingent upon Canadian government regulatory approval and finalizing a definitive agreement.</p>
<p>Allied said it expects the transaction to be completed by the end of September.  </p>
<p>The agreement, announced on May 27, calls for Allied to pay approximately $114.5 million and assume the liabilities of the businesses.</p>
<p>Ryder provides logistics and transportation services in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Europe and South America.</p>
<p>Allied is a parent company of several subsidiaries engaged in the automotive distribution business.</p>
