<p>NWE gas oil stagnated on Friday as benchmark IPE gas oil futures oscillated around Thursday's closing levels and slack demand amid healthy supply kept premiums in negative territory, traders said.</p>
<p>July IPE gas oil was flat at $159.50 a tonne at 1140 GMT having spent most the morning some 50 cents under Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was very quiet with many buyers sidelined as they waited for futures drop to bottom out.</p>
<p>"In 35 years of trading I can honestly say I have never seen such a quiet market," said one trader. "It's unbelievable."</p>
<p>In spite of recent lacklustre demand falling crude prices have kept refinery margins at high levels encouraging refiners to keep production at full capacity, which traders say is further exacerbating the over-supply situation.</p>
<p>"I think the fact margins are so good is part of the problem," said another trader.</p>
<p>Heating oil barges were talked around July IPE -50 cents/flat fob ARA for June delivery.</p>
<p>Low sulphur barge premiums were slightly weaker at July IPE +$4.00/+$5.00 fob ARA.</p>
<p>Cargoes were similarly depressed. Russian premiums were talked around -$1.0/flat cif NWE, while German DIN was assessed roughly $1.0 to $1.50 above there.</p>
<p>EN590 was little changed with with premiums quoted around $5.0/$6.0 cif NWE for June delivery.</p>
