<p>Boris Becker'S  bumper payday of $1.875 million at the Grand Slam Cup was a fitting reward for a true professional at the end of one of the toughest years of his life.</p>
<p>After his 6-3 6-4 6-4 triumph over Goran Ivanisevic in Sunday's final, Becker spoke of black moments in an injury-marred year when he had worried if he would ever play properly again.</p>
<p>The Australian Open champion suffered an illness earlier in the year and then a leg muscle tear forced him out of the French Open.</p>
<p>He recovered to win at Queen's Club just before Wimbledon but then sustained a serious wrist injury during the event he considered the most important which left him in plaster.</p>
<p>But the 29-year-old German has bounced back to produce some of the best tennis of his life.</p>
<p>While some players were criticised for taking the money and running at the richest tournament in the game in Munich, Becker has produced performances which have delighted his home fans.</p>
<p>"I was severely injured for three months. I couldn't hold a racquet," Becker said. "You start thinking 'Will I ever be able to play tennis again well? Or was that it?' I have never felt so much pressure in my career.</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, it is a very good feeling to start the Christmas holidays knowing that you are at your peak. I'm looking forward (to the New Year) and hope I can get back to this level as soon as possible."</p>
<p>The Cup, which brings together the best performers from the four grand slams -- Wimbledon and the U.S., French and Australian Opens -- offers the biggest prize money in the game. Even first-round losers take home $100,000</p>
<p>Andre Agassi left the tournament with the boos of a disappointed crowd ringing in his ears after a below-par first-round defeat. Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek was also a major disappointment.</p>
<p>Organisers admitted on Sunday that some players had taken the money and run.</p>
<p>"I think there have been some problems with players this year here," International Tennis Federation (ITF) president Brian Tobin said. "I think one has to look at some of the players and ask whether they're acting in a professional way towards their sport..."</p>
<p>Tennis fans in Germany realise that the days of watching Becker dominating the game may be numbered. He will be 30 next year and it is known that he does not want the strains of the circuit to disrupt his family life much longer.</p>
<p>But in this form, the German must be a hot favourite to defend his title at next month's Australian Open. If he stays at this level, he is capable of winning at Wimbledon for a fourth time and challenging Pete Sampras for the number one spot.</p>
<p>"He had a good chance to become the number one this year if he didn't have injury," Ivanisevic said. "He's going to be one of the tough opponents to beat. I think he's going to be dangerous to be number one next year."</p>
<p>Becker has beaten Sampras twice indoors in the last few months and barely lost a five-set thriller to the American in the final of last month's ATP world championship. The German, currently ranked sixth, has respect for Sampras but knows he can challenge him.</p>
<p>"I think we have a very good number one and I would not put myself above that, " he said. "But I'm not far behind."</p>
