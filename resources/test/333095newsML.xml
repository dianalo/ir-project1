<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on Saturday met Libyan counterpart Omar al-Montasser and discussed an Organisation for African Unity (OAU) meeting due to be held in Tripoli next month.</p>
<p>Airport sources said Moussa and Montasser, who flew in from Ethiopia, held talks for about an hour at Cairo airport. Moussa told reporters that Montasser told him that almost all OAU members would send delegations.</p>
<p>OAU sources have said the ministerial meeting, which will take place on February 24 to 28, would be the pan-African body's highest-level meeting in Libya since a 1982 summit.</p>
<p>Last week, Montasser flew out of Libya with a foreign ministry delegation to bolster support for the upcoming meeting, breaking an air embargo imposed on his country.</p>
<p>The United Nations imposed the ban on Libya for failing to extradite two men charged with the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Scotland in which 270 people were killed.</p>
<p>Ministers attending the OAU meeting will travel by land and sea to Libya, OAU officials said.</p>
