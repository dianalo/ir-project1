<title>USA: CBOT corn closes higher on bullish USDA report.</title>
<headline>CBOT corn closes higher on bullish USDA report.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT corn futures closed higher on bullish input from USDA's crop production and supply/demand reports, traders said.</p>
<p>"It was a friendly report but not ravishingly bullish," said Paul Haugens, vice president for Chicago-based trade house FIMAT Futures. "The corn price paramter moved from maybe $2.55 to $2.60 per bushel up to $2.75 to $2.80."</p>
<p>USDA Friday said 1996 U.S. corn production totaled 9.293 billion bushels, below an average of analysts' estimates for 9.317 billion.</p>
<p>USDA also trimmed its outlook for corn ending stocks.</p>
<p>The government now says the supply of corn in the U.S. at the end of the 1996-97 marketing year, on August 31, 1997, will total 959 million bushels. That is less than USDA's previous outlook for 1.157 billion bushels.</p>
<p>Corn surged the 12-cent-a-bushel limit in early dealings but sagged from the day's highs on commercial selling, tied to an increase in farmer selling, traders said.</p>
<p>Funds bought at least 40 million bushels of corn on the day and Cargill Inc sold 10.0 million of March, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn closed 3-3/4 to 8-3/4 cents per bushel higher, with March up 7-1/4 at $2.65-1/2.  </p>
<p>Keying the demand were R.J. O'Brien, Merrill Lynch Futures, Refco Inc and Lee B. Stern and Co each with six million bushels purchased in the March, traders said. Refco also bought six million May and three million July, they said.</p>
<p>Term Commodities, the marketing arm of Louis Dreyfus Corp, sold five million March and sold three million May and Farmers Commodities Corp sold three million bushels of July, traders said.</p>
<p>Floor sources said Friday's action was a potential barometer of what is to come for the balance of the year.</p>
<p>"It was the biggest day we've had in a long time. Any weather problems this year, then look out," said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 75,000 contracts, sharply above the 37,284 contracts traded Thursday.</p>
<p>In corn options, Refco Inc bought 1,000 March $2.60 calls at nine to 10-1/2 cents, Farmers Commodities Corp bought 600 March $2.80 cals at 2-1/4 cents and Prudential Securities sold 500 March $2.70 puts and four to five cents and sold 500 March $2.60 puts at 1-1/2 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 14,000 contracts, above the 11,416 contracts traded Thursday.</p>
