<p>Japanese maritime officials said on Monday they may have found the body of the captain of a Russian tanker that broke up early this month causing Japan's worst oil spill.</p>
<p>"The body of a foreigner has been found by a local resident which matches the captain's body size and shape. Local police are working to identify whether it is the captain or not," a Maritime Safety Agency (MSA) official said.</p>
<p>The body was found on Sunday night on Shirahama beach near Echizen in Fukui prefecture, about 300 km (190 miles) west of Tokyo.</p>
<p>The 13,157-tonne Russian tanker Nakhodka, carrying 19,000 tonnes (133,000 barrels) of fuel oil, broke in two in stormy waters in the Sea of Japan on January 2 some 130 km (80 miles) off the coast of of Fukui prefecture.</p>
<p>The tanker's crew members were all rescued except for captain Valeriy Melnikov, who has been missing and presumed dead.</p>
<p>"The body's condition is consistent with a long period of immersion in the sea," the MSA official said.</p>
<p>He said Russian diplomats were travelling to the area to examine the body to make a positive identification.</p>
<p>The tanker disaster has claimed three other lives, all elderly men who died from heart attacks while assisting in cleanup operations along a lengthy stretch of coastline.</p>
<p>The spill has badly polluted rich fishing grounds and many popular tourist beaches.</p>
