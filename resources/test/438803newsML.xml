<p>British aeroengine maker Rolls-Royce Plc is on the verge of selling its power engineering unit Parsons to Siemens AG of Germany, according to a report in the Times citing unnamed industry sources.</p>
<p>It said key staff from Parsons had already been interviewed by the German group but the final price, thought to be around 30 million stg ($47.9 million), was still to be agreed.</p>
<p>Rolls said last week it was close to selling Parsons and another power generation unit, International Combustion. The two were put up for sale last July as Rolls opted to focus on its aeroengine operations.</p>
<p>No-one at Rolls was immediately available for comment.</p>
