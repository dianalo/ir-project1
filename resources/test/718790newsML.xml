<title>NIGERIA: Shell Nigeria lays off hundreds of contract staff.</title>

<p>More than 300 workers for contractors to the Nigerian unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group have lost their jobs in cost-cutting measures, a company spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"They are not our staff as such. They are Nigerian and expatriate staff of contractors working for Shell whose services are no longer needed because of budget cuts," he said.</p>
<p>The independent Guardian newspaper reported on Thursday that 363 staff were laid off in Port Harcourt, the eastern division of Shell's Nigerian operations last Friday.</p>
<p>This followed the Nigerian government's decision to trim Shell's operational budget for 1997 by 30 percent, it said.</p>
<p>Shell Nigeria is a joint venture between Shell and state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC).</p>
<p>The Nigerian government has been slow in coming up with its share of the joint venture's operational funds in addition to the reduction of its budget.</p>
<p>"We are trying to make the government see the point for proper funding for the oil industry and the implication for the future if the present situation continues," said a Shell official.</p>
<p>The government approved $2.05 billion as its contribution to the funding this year, the same amount as last year, for the six multinational oil firms in Nigeria in which it has an average 57 percent equity holding.</p>
<p>The result has been reduced exploration activities, which the companies argue will lead to fewer oil finds and lower production.</p>
<p>Nigeria currently pumps about 2.2 million barrels per day but many rigs are idle because of the reduced activities of the oil companies.</p>
