<p>Richard Jewell said on Wednesday the FBI tried to publicly humiliate him when he was a suspect in the Atlanta bombing during the summer Olympic Games and urged a congressional committee to find out why.</p>
<p>"Not only did the FBI accuse the wrong man, its agents in Atlanta and its officials in Washington actively participated in publicly humiliating me and privately violating my constitutional rights," Jewell, the former security guard who for 88 days was the only named suspect in the still unsolved bombing, told the House Judiciary Committee.</p>
<p>"I am...here to ask you to commit yourselves and the resources of this committee to a legitimate investigation into the very disturbing questions raised by the FBI investigation of me," Jewel, flanked by his attorneys, said.</p>
<p>Jewell, who was working as a security guard, discovered a backpack containing the pipe bomb that exploded a year ago during the Olympics, killing one person and injuring more than 100 others. A cameraman also died of a heart attack at the scene.</p>
<p>"The treatment Richard Jewell suffered at the hands of the FBI is outrageous and it is this committee's responsibility to investigate the incident and to consider whether precautions can be taken so that others do not suffer similar injustice at the hands of federal law enforcement agents in the future," Michigan Democrat John Conyers said.</p>
<p>Conyers urged the committee to have FBI Director Louis Freeh testify before it, calling Freeh "the person who might lose his job over this."</p>
<p>In his testimony Jewell said a Justice Department report released this week on parts of the FBI investigation was "filled with false statements, half-truths and gross distortions of the truth."</p>
<p>The report said FBI agents in Atlanta made "a major error" when they questioned Jewell, who did not know he was a suspect, under the guise that they were making a training video on how to interview the first people who arrive at a crime scene.</p>
<p>But the report exonerated Freeh and top officials in Washington because it said they did not know about the training video ploy, which was intended to make the interview less confrontational.</p>
<p>Jewell said the FBI knew within a few days after his name was leaked to the media that it "had a public relations disaster on its hands," and that it had the wrong suspect.</p>
<p>But, he said he was left hanging for 88 days before the FBI publicly dropped him as a suspect.</p>
<p>Jewell, who said he has not been able to find work since the bombing, said he was the target of leaks by law enforcement officials that were "clearly calculated to bolster the idea that I was the bomber."</p>
