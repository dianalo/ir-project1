<p>The Netherlands said Wednesday it would launch a campaign over the coming months to inform the public over the controversial import of new genetically-engineered soybeans from the United States.</p>
<p>"You have to be open about this and tell the consumer that this type of soybean is coming into Europe," agriculture minister Jozias van Aartsen told a press briefing.</p>
<p>He said the Dutch would not ban the U.S. product despite opposition from consumer and environmental groups.</p>
<p>The so-called transgenic soybeans have been genetically altered to withstand treatment by the herbicide Roundup.</p>
<p>The technology was developed by U.S. chemicals giant Monsanto, which forecasts farmers in the United States will plant 5 million to 10 million acres of the beans this autumn, up to around one sixth of the total crop.</p>
<p>Monsanto says the new beans require treatment from fewer herbicides than normal, because Roundup controls a greater variety of weeds than competing products.</p>
<p>But environmental lobby group Greenpeace, which opposes genetic engineering alleging it promotes allergies, says the consumer will have no choice in whether or not to eat the new beans, which will find their way into a wide variety of foods.</p>
