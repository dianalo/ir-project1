<p>A panel of Palestinian lawmakers investigating corruption urged President Yasser Arafat on Tuesday to sack his entire cabinet and put at least one minister suspected of wrongdoing on trial.</p>
<p>"The committee recommends to the president of the Palestinian Authority to dissolve the cabinet and form a new cabinet made up of technocrats and qualified people," a report to the Palestinian Legislative Council said.</p>
<p>It specifically recommended trial for Civilian Affairs Minister Jamil al-Tarifi on suspicion of corruption and called for investigations into Planning Minister Nabil Shaath and Transport Minister Ali Kawasmeh</p>
<p>None of the ministers named was immediately available for comment. Arafat could also not be reached.</p>
<p>The recommendations, made in a report to the assembly by a panel of nine lawmakers, follow increasing complaints by Palestinians and legislators of alleged corruption and mismanagement in Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>"The president of the Authority should issue his instructions to punish violators against whom there has been proof of guilt and to punish them immediately and to take them to court in order to restore confidence between the Palestinian Authority and its people," the report said.</p>
<p>Ministers found to be corrupt or incompetent should not be brought back into the cabinet, it added. The report also called for action against security forces who interfered in the collection of taxes and customs duties.</p>
<p>Nabil Amr, a member of the council, said the report would receive a first reading before going to the cabinet. It would then return to the council for two further readings, he said.</p>
<p>Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi called the report a serious effort to secure public accountability and said its recommendations should be studied carefully.</p>
<p>"Changes should not be cosmetic," Ashrawi told Reuters. "We are quite a small society and everybody knows everybody. Nothing could be hidden."</p>
<p>An official auditor's report earlier this year found that members of the Palestinian Authority had squandered $326 million in public funds last year.</p>
<p>Those findings were the subject of an investigation by a committee appointed by Arafat which reported last week that while money had not been squandered, serious financial, legal and administrative violations had taken place.</p>
<p>It recommended putting some senior officials on trial and proposed stringent reforms.</p>
<p>The stench of corruption in Palestinian self-rule areas has increased pressure on Arafat from international donors, including the European Union and the United States, to ensure aid to the ailing Palestinian economy is properly spent.</p>
<p>Tuesday's report recommended that Tarifi be indicted in connection with the alleged illegal import from Egypt of medicines that had passed their expiry dates and violations of vehicle import regulations.</p>
<p>It proposed investigations into Shaath, a prominent negotiator in the Authority's dealings with Israel, and Kawasmeh but stopped short of recommending their indictment.</p>
<p>The recommendations were welcomed by Palestinian critics of the Authority, though they added that further steps had to be taken to restore public confidence.</p>
<p>"It is an important step but it should be followed by other steps to form a mechanism that guarantees that no person can misuse the power in his hands," said Isam Younis, of the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights in Gaza.</p>
