<p>The Irish government, employers and unions face some tough talking if they are to secure a successor to the current wage agreement, the Programme for Competitiveness and Work, which expires at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Negotiations on a new agreement begin on October 23 and unions and employers are expected to adopt a tough stance, demanding significant tax cuts and tight control of public spending before they sign up for any new accord.</p>
<p>A consensus approach by government, employers and unions to the management of the economy, known as social partership, has been a cornerstone of Irish economic success in recent years.</p>
<p>CONSENSUS HAS KEPT LID ON WAGE INFLATION, WORKER UNREST</p>
<p>This approach, including centralised pay agreements, has kept a lid on wage inflation and industrial unrest, allowing Ireland to enjoy the fastest-growing economy in the European Union while maintaining a comfortably low inflation rate.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that the Programme for Competitiveness and Work (PCW) has been central to our economic and employment performance over the past three years," said Irish finance minister Ruairi Quinn in a speech earlier this year.</p>
<p>"Despite inauspicious external conditions, we have made remarkable progress and, moreover, have done so on a thoroughly sustainable basis."</p>
<p>But Irish trade unions are less sure of the benefits conferred on their members by the PCW and are determined to take a tough stance when negotiating its successor.</p>
<p>"It is obvious from the comments emanating at European level, that the success of our economy is all put down to the fact that we have had a partnership at national level for the past nine years which included very modest pay adjustments," says Jimmy Somers, vice-president of SIPTU, Ireland's largest trade union.</p>
<p>"But we seem to have been the only people acting responsibly while everyone else was cashing in on the miracle."</p>
<p>UNION MEMBERS PESSIMISTIC</p>
<p>The unions, represented by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), have agreed to enter talks with government and employers but many union members are not terribly optimistic about a successful outcome.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't give you better than even money. I think that it is going to be a very difficult thing because we as a union and as an executive are determined to deliver progress on some of these core issures," SIPTU president Eddie Browne said in a magazine interview.</p>
<p>"If we can't get the employers to play ball with us and if we can't get the government to respond effectively I don't see us going very far into the talks process."</p>
<p>The unions will be demanding wage increases and significant tax reform with some union officials talking about tax cuts totalling 800 million Irish pounds ($1.28 billion) over a three-year period.</p>
<p>Local bargaining at company level is also expected to rank high on the agenda.</p>
<p>"A pat on the head for workers in appreciation of the vital role the social partnership process has played in completely transforming the Irish economy will not be enough," Somers says.</p>
<p>EMPLOYERS HAVE OWN DEMANDS</p>
<p>It is not just the unions that are expected to talk tough. Irish employers have their own set of demands.</p>
<p>They also want tax reform but want it aimed at alleviating the cost of employment and corporation tax, not just the burden of personal taxation.</p>
<p>"Given the scale of the challenges facing Ireland in the immediate future, particularly in regard to EU developments such as EMU, enlargement and the likelihood of somewhat lower funds from European transfers in the future, we believe that a tax package must relate to these challenges also," said John Dunne, director-general of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC).</p>
<p>Government spending is another bugbear for employers' organisations who argue that radical tax reductions will not be possible without a reduction in public spending.</p>
<p>The Irish Small Firms Association (SFA) has said tax cuts and job creation have been squandered in order to increase the living standards of public sector employees.</p>
<p>"The unfortunate reality is that the fruits of growth are being dissipated in an apparently uncontrolled public sector pay orgy," the SFA says.</p>
<p>Aside from tax reform and the size of pay increases, the issue of local bargaining is likely to figure prominently in the talks. The unions are keen to see greater flexibility at company level which would allow workers in profitable firms to share in the gains being made.</p>
<p>"The development of profit sharing will be a crucial element in a new deal and I think it would be impossible to construct a new partnership without it," says ICTU head Peter Cassells.</p>
<p>But IBEC remains wary of any central agreement on the issue given the diversity of circumstances at local level.</p>
<p>"Our view is that it is a matter that should properly be addressed at the level of the enterprise in the context of the particular circumstances of the individual firms," says Dunne.</p>
<p>"We do not therefore see it as a right, rather something that may satisfy the needs of both employers and employees in particular circumstances."</p>
<p>Union recognition may be another bone of contention.</p>
<p>Apart from Scandinavia, Ireland has the highest level of trade union membership among EU countries at more than 50 percent of the workforce. But trade union penetration of the private sector stands at around 35 percent against 90 percent in the public sector and is a cause of concern.</p>
<p>"Union recognition has to be dealt with in the talks," said SIPTU's Browne. "We cannot visualise a society where there is growing acceptance of the right of employers not to recognise trade unions. It is an abnegation of democracy."</p>
<p>The unions say that multinationals who come to Ireland should not be allowed to enjoy the benefits of social partnership while refusing to recognise unions.</p>
<p>But government and employers will want to tread warily on this issue, fearing it could damage Ireland's appeal as a location for investment.</p>
<p>"It is important that we do nothing to inhibit the continued attraction of foreign investment into Ireland," says Dunne. ($1=.6230 Punt)</p>
