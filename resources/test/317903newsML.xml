<p>Less than six months after being spun off from AT&amp;T Corp, Lucent Technologies Inc has proved it has the muscle to stay abreast of rivals across the full range of telecommunications equipment.</p>
<p>Analysts predicted robust growth for the group, which is expected to release fiscal first-quarter earnings on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"It will easily become the next IBM (International Business Machines Corp ) -- if it isn't in that league already," said Randy Carlson, an analyst with the Yankee Group.  </p>
<p>First Call's analysts' consensus is $1.32 a share for the first quarter to December 31, compared with a proforma of $1.30 for the year-ago period.</p>
<p>For the year, analysts foresee earnings of $2.03 a share against a proforma of $1.65 for fiscal 1996.</p>
<p>After it was spun off in September, some analysts were uneasy about whether Lucent could thrive with a new name and without the backing of its giant parent in a world where new equipment markets grow at a startling rapidity.  </p>
<p>But the company has tried hard to enter newer, more profitable markets, after having depended heavily on old, low-margin businesses like small-office switches and consumer telephones for its revenues.</p>
<p>Luke Szymczak at Prudential Securities said the company has done well in wireless systems and semiconductors.</p>
<p>"There's good revenue growth in cellular infrastructure (too)," he said, referring to another high-margin business.</p>
<p>Carlson at Yankee Group said Lucent has a lot of potential given its broad product line.  "It's one of the most diversified manufacturers of telecommunications equipment."  </p>
<p>Jeanne Hanley at Capital Reflections said Lucent was well positioned to take advantage of equipment to support the Internet given how it spent more money on research and development than the total worth of potential competitors.</p>
<p>Although some local telephone companies might be exaggerating the strain that Internet users are putting on their systems, they still need to replace them, she said.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T shareholders, who had a miserable 1996 in general, had a little good cheer with Lucent stock, of which they got one share for about every three AT&amp;T shares held.  </p>
<p>Lucent stock has soared 62 percent since its initial public offering in April.  Since its spinoff last fall, the rise has been a more modest 18 percent.  AT&amp;T shares excluding Lucent have fallen five percent over the same period.</p>
<p>Lucent shares were trading on Monday at $52-1/4, up 1/2.</p>
<p>Szymczak said he did not see any new rivals threatening Lucent's share of the market in the near future. (Corrects by deleting reference to France's Alcatel Alsthom).</p>
<p>Hanley said Lucent had yet to exploit all of the possibilities that awaited it abroad, since its international operations were responsible for only about a third of its business.</p>
<p>Carlson was confident about the company's next endeavors.</p>
<p>"I'm bullish on Lucent," he said. "They have had nothing but success since it was spun off from AT&amp;T."</p>
