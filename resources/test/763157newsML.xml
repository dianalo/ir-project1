<p>Two general obligation bond issues totalling $38.4 million could go before voters in North Carolain's Moore County in November, the Fayetteville Observer-Times said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The county school board voted 7-1 Monday night to ask county commissioners to put a $26.9 million bond issue before voters. The issue would finance construction of two new middle schools and renovations and expansions at existing schools.</p>
<p>The board of directors at Sandhills Community College are expected to approve a similar resolution next week seeking a referendum on $11.5 million of bonds for construction and renovation.</p>
<p>Dr. John Dempsey, chairman of the college board, said an opinion poll conducted for the college suggests the referendums would pass.</p>
