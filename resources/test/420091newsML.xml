<p>Sub Sea International Inc, a unit of Dresser Industries Inc, said Wednesday it had signed a letter of intent to sell some of its assets to Global Industries Inc for $110 million.</p>
<p>The assets are located in the Mideast, Far East, Asia Pacific and Gulf of Mexico and includes diving, diving support and other vessels and related gear in those areas.</p>
<p>The sale is subject to execution of a final agreement and satisfaction of other conditions, including regulatory waiting periods, it said.  </p>
<p>Brent Ford, president of Sub Sea, said the transaction would free his company to focus on the market for offshore oil and gas production services, particularly in deepwater activities.</p>
<p>Dresser is a supplier of highly engineered products and services used in hydrocarbon energy-related activities.</p>
