<p>Two thirds of business passengers flying the world's airlines favour a total smoking ban on all international routes and a further 11 per cent want it banned on most flights, the global industry body IATA said on Friday.</p>
<p>IATA, the International Air Transport Association, said the finding emerged from its latest annual Corporate Air Travel Survey which taps the views on all aspects of airline travel of a sample of 1,000 business travellers.</p>
<p>The survey also found a growing demand for inflight phones among frequent long-distance travellers who are not allowed to use personal mobile equipment for fear that it might interfere with aircraft communications.</p>
<p>Businessmen and women also wanted more live information services and the possibility to order goods and make travel reservations while on board their flights, IATA said.</p>
<p>The survey found smoking was still a controversial issue, despite swelling sentiment against it and the total ban in force on domestic flights within the United States.</p>
<p>Replies to the IATA questionnaire indicated that Europeans were the most "pro-smoking" sector of the global travelling business public, with nearly 25 per cent opposing any further restrictions.</p>
<p>Despite the mounting consensus, industry officials say there is resistance among the airlines themselves to a total ban -- although the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) wants one imposed by the end of this year.</p>
<p>According to the officials, when IATA itself tried last year to convince its 232 member airlines to support the United Nations agency, objections came from both airlines that already have extensive bans and those that do not.</p>
<p>"They see it as a marketing issue," one official said. "Those that have a ban feel they have a competitive advantage in attracting the non-smokers, and those that have less restrictions believe they corner the smokers' market."</p>
<p>Officials say airlines based in Europe suffer from a jumble of bans and partial bans that leave passengers confused, and companies struggle to cope with different cultural attitudes to the question even within the 15-nation European Union.</p>
<p>When the Scandinavian airline SAS tried to bring in a total ban under Swedish law, one said, marketing managers at its hub in Copenhagen warned that Danish businessmen -- partial to a smoke and schnapps -- would switch to other companies.</p>
<p>Among other findings in the survey was unease among business travellers over the rapidly expanding "code-sharing" system under which travellers booked with one company may find themselves flying on another, associated, airline.</p>
<p>"Many passengers feel confused or angry when they have not been informed about the code-share service, so proper disclosure of information at all stages in the booking process wppears to be the key to higher customer satisfaction," IATA said.</p>
<p>The survey also turned up some doubts about the future of airline business travel.</p>
<p>Although 83 per cent of those questioned felt there was at present no substitute for air travel in their jobs, more than 50 per cent thought telecommunications techniques like video- conferences would replace much of it over the next decade.</p>
