<p>THE DOMINION</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minsiter Winston Peters would defend himself vigorously during the probe by Parliament's powerful privileges committee into his late-night scuff with Coalition teammate John Banks last Wednesday, a spokesman for Peters said. "He regards the matter as a sub judice until the committee meets, but he is certainly going to defend himself vigorously" chief press secretary Roger Foley said. Page 1.</p>

<p>Inconsistencies in the Coalition Agreement and the government's economic policies were highlighted by finance and expenditure select committee members on Wednesday when Treasurer Winston Peters appeared before the committee to explain the government's Budget policy statement. Peters, flanked by Treasury head Mark Prebble, was grilled by National, Labour, Alliance, and ACT NZ select committee members about the high dollar, superannuation, the government's commitment to extra spending, and the effect that would have on the economy.

<p>Labour MP Mike Moore has questioned wheether Serious Fraud Office director Chas Sturt should step aside from an inquiry into Aotearoa Television Network. In Parliament on Wednesday Moore asked Attorney-General Paul East whether he still had confidence in Sturt and whether he would discuss Sturt's continued employment with State Services commissioner Don Hunn.

<p>Tourism Minister Murray McCully wants the Tourism Board to make a bigger effort in luring visitors from Australia, North America, and Europe. "I believe we should own up to a fairly ordinary recent performance in our traditional markets," McCully told delegates at the opening of the inaugural three-day Rural Tourism Conference in Methven. "I have made it clear to the board that this year I will be looking to purchase significantly better outcomes in these markets." Page 2.</p>

<p>A High Court ruling that Maoris did not need a licence to fish for trout in traditional trbal fisheries was "wrong and inflammatory and stupid", Labour MP Mike Moore said on Wednesday. The former Labour leader said the ruling, by District Court judge Andrew Becroft, was an example of changes being wrought to New Zealand by "aggressive, activist" judges and bureaucrats. Page 2.</p>

<p>Winston Peters was not asked about his allegations in Parliament of scams involving the Bank of New Zealand because the Serious Fraud Office did not think they had substance, the Winebox inquiry heard on Wednesday. SFO director Charles Sturt, back from an illness-enforced absence of more than two weeks, was defending the office's decision to monitor rather than investigate the bank. Page 3.</p>

<p>National grid operator Trans Power says it will hold its charges for the coming year, saving customers between $10 million and $12 million. The move comes as Trans Power faces increased competition from regional power generation such as new co-generation plants at industrial sites like dairy factories and large power users such as hospitals. Under Trans Power's contracts with its customers, it had the option of lifting charges over the coming financial year, starting in April, by 2.4 percent. The rise was based on the Reserve Bank's assessment of underlying inflation. Page 18.</p>

<p>Air New Zealand could not sell its catering business to Ansett New Zealand's flight caterer, the Commerce Commission said on Wednesday. PRI Flight Catering asked the commission to allow it to buy the catering business of Air New Zealand. The application was rejected by the commission, which said if the proposed sale went ahead, PRI would have between 85 and 90 percent of the market and would be the only large operator in New Zealand.

<p>Air New Zealand could look outside Unites Airlines and its six airline alliance partners for future global commercial flying links. That indication was given by Air New Zealand boss Jim McCrea at an investment conference in Auckland on Wednesday. Air New Zealand starts a commercial alliance, code sharing up to 84 flights a week with United Airlines on Tasman and Pacific routes, from next month. McCrea said British Airways and the main American airlines had significant alliance partners, "but they may not be as cohesive as they appeared". Page 18.</p>

<p>Listed investment company Guinness Peat Group reported a profit on Wednesday of 19.14 million pounds (NZ$44.26 million) for the year to December 31 from 14.71 million pounds previously. The company, which also signalled some form of share reduction during the coming year, declared a dividend of 0.25p a share and confirmed the traditional one-for-10 bonus share issue, but said no rights issue would be made this year.

<p>Power companies are to escape a $30 million charge levied for use of the Cook Strait cable and have been promised a further real term reduction in transmission costs. Resolution of the seven-month-old dispute over the pricing of the Cook Srait cable is now only days away, with state generator Electricity Corporation telling power companies on Wednesday that it was scrapping a 0.17 cents per kilowatt-hour surcharge it applied to its power contracts last year to recover the charge imposed by grid operator Trans Power.

<p>Hudson Corporate New Zealand has acquired a 60 percent stake in Hutt-based road traffic product manufacturer Roadmark. Hudson, a subsidiary of listed Aushardware and building materials group Hudson Timber and Hardware, announced last year that it would also take a 25 percent stake in Pacific Capital Assets, parent company behind Auckland's Britomart complex.

<p>Many small- and medium-sized companies could lose special rights if they have not voluntarily reregistered by July 1. Those rights are pre-emptive share purchase rights and special voting rights held by particular shareholders -- common in many companies, according to a business adviser. The rights are written into a company's articles of association, but those articles will cease to exist when the Companies Act 1955 lapses on July 1 and the Companies Act 1993 comes into force.

<p>THE NEW ZEALAND HERALD</p>
<p>The director of the Serious Fraud Office, Charles Sturt, reappeared at the winebox inquiry on Wednesday looking fit and healthy, and defended his handling of allegations concerning the Bank of New Zealand. Sturt, back after nearly three weeks of sickness, said he did not regard a Winston Peters allegation concerning the BNZ as a matter that should go to the top of his investigations list.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>The Attorney-General, Paul East, will not say whether the Serious Fraud Office head, Chas Sturt, still has his confidence in the light of reports that Sturt misled him. Labour MP Mike Moore asked East in Parliament on Wednesday if Sturt still enjoyed his confidence in the light of the reports, and if he did not, then would he speak to the States Services Commissioner about Sturt's continued employment. East said it was not appropriate for him to comment because the winebox inquiry was still going.</p>

<p>   THE PRESS</p>
<p>   Prime Minister Jim Bolger's right to sit on Parliament's powerful privileges committee on Thursday when it hears an assault charge against his deputy, Winston Peters, will be challenged by Alliance leader Jim Anderton. Bolger said through a spokesman that he expected to chair the eight-member committee, which will rule on a charge that Peters assaulted government backbencher John Banks in a corridor outside the debating chamber on March 5.

<p>   New Zealand motorists could face breath tests for cannabis -- but not in the short term, Police Minister Jack Elder said. Elder told Parliament on Wednesday the police had made inquiries with "industry sources" who had advised cannabis sniffers would be available in the future. However, no decision on whether to use the equipment had yet been made, he said. Page 6.</p>

<p>   New Zealand firms that survived the economic restructuring of the last decade faced more turbulent times, Fletcher Challenge's chief executive, Hugh Fletcher, said on Wednesday. While the earlier storm was domestic, the present one was global, he told an international audience at the New Zealand Investment Conference in Auckland. Page 32.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>The Commerce Commission on Wednesday warned about pyramid selling schemes after filing charges in the Christchurch District Court alleging breaches of the Fair Trading Act. The commission's fair trading manager, Rachel Leamy, said that the charges were filed on Wednesday. The defendant's names could not be revealed because they were appealing against a decision not to grant interim name suppression. The case was expected to be heard in May, she said. Pyramid selling schemes were prohibited under section 24 of the Fair Trading Act. Page 32.</p>

<p>The New Zealand forestry sector is well positioned to meet growing Asian demand for value-added processed wood fibre well into the next century, Carter Holt Harvey's chief executive John Faraci told New Zealand Investment Conference delegates in Auckland on Wednesday. Faraci acknowledged recent economic and industrial reform in New Zealand has enabled many companies to become more competitive and add value to the economy. Page 32.</p>

<p>Air New Zealand's 1997-98 profit will rebound strongly, compared with expected earnings for the June 1997 year, managing director Jim McCrea told investors on Wednesday. However, the price of increased earnings will probably be significant job losses, he said. After addressing an investment conference in Auckland, McCrea said the company was on track to cut costs by $100 million this year, partly through staff restructuring. Page 32.</p>

<p>Resolute Samantha, which grew out of the takeover of Associated Gold Fields which in turn bought New Zealand's Kiwi International Resources in a reverse takeover, has cut its interim dividend. The dividend had fallen from 3 Australian cents to 1 Australian cent to allow Resolute to expand mine production, the directors said on Wednesday. Page 32.</p>
