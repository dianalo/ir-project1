<p>An expert testifying in O.J. Simpson's wrongful death civil trial said Friday that some blood evidence in the case contained a preservative used in police sample tubes.</p>
<p>Fredric Rieders, a forensic toxicologist called by the defence team to bolster its case that blood was planted and evidence was contaminated, said he found the preservative EDTA in blood on socks police recovered from Simpson's bedroom and on a stain on the back gate of his ex-wife's condominium.</p>
<p>The former football star's socks contained blood consistent with that of Nicole Brown Simpson's while the back gate stain was consistent with Simpson's blood.</p>
<p>Simpson was acquitted of the June 1994 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman by a criminal court jury in October 1995. He is now fighting a wrongful death lawsuit brought by the families of the victims.</p>
<p>Simpson's attorneys claim the presence of the preservative indicates blood taken from Simpson after the murders was used to taint evidence.</p>
<p>Rieders said there were only two possible sources for the EDTA -- which prevents blood from coagulating -- from a blood sample tube or through contamination of the blood stains in the laboratory.</p>
<p>Rieders said purple-topped tubes such as those used by the Los Angeles Police Department to take blood samples from Simpson and the victims came with EDTA already in them.</p>
<p>He said he found the existence of EDTA in the stains by studying the results of a mass spectrometry analysis conducted by the FBI.</p>
<p>Simpson was not in court Friday as he awaited a ruling by an Orange County family court judge on his bid to regain custody of his two young children by Nicole Brown Simpson.</p>
<p>The judge in the custody case ruled that Sydney, 11, and Justin, 8, who have lived with their maternal grandparents since just after their mother's 1994 murder, should be returned to their father, attorney Natasha Roit told reporters.</p>
