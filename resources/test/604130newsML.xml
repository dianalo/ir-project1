<headline>Analysts welcome Veba's Degussa stake.</headline>

<p>Following are analysts' comments on news that utility group Veba has bought a 36.4 percent stake in Degussa AG.</p>
<p>THOMAS DESER, BHF Bank (raised Veba to buy from hold, raised EPS outlook by ten pfennigs over each of next two years to 5.70 marks in 1997 and 6.30 marks in 1998)</p>
<p>"This is certainly positive for Veba. It shows Veba as a group moving into a new phase of its activities and it has made clear that this should have a positive effect on earnings. This shows that the restructuring phase is over for Veba and it is now seeking acquisitions, not only in the chemicals sector but also in other areas, like trading, services and electricity. The fact that it does not need a capital increase is also positive."  </p>
<p>Christine Dienhart, chemicals analyst, Bayerische Vereinsbank, Munich</p>
<p>"This is very positive news. The best part is the 86.80 marks per share price paid, which confirms that our own long term target for the share of 92.50 marks is in the right area.</p>
<p>I think what will happen now is that the companies will just work together but I could see Veba raising its stake and we could see it at a manouevreable percentage within a year.</p>
<p>Veba is a very good partner to live with. It is not the sort of company to force anyone's hand.</p>
<p>There are not many areas of overlap but one of the first areas I could see to benefit would be plexiglass. Degussa's carbon black operations also could mean Veba could reduce oil prices, cutting the cyclicality at Huels (Veba's chemicals unit) which is very positive.</p>
<p>This could also well mean that the spin-off of Asta Medica (Degussa's medical unit) could go ahead sooner rather than later, as it would not really fit in with a pure chemicals group. This is also good, as Asta is already regarded by analysts as a stand-alone operation."  </p>
<p>NASSEER PANJU, pharmaceuticals analyst, Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank AG.</p>
<p>"I am surprised. It is pretty tricky right now as we do not know which business areas will be affected. But there are certain areas which lend themselves to co-operation between Huels and Degussa, such as acrylic glass, where Degussa is quite strong.</p>
<p>The fact that Veba took a 36 percent stake, when they could have easily brought it up to 51 percent over the market, is a sign that they believe in the Degussa management. I believe they wanted to have a major player in chemicals and what Degussa has achieved under (chief excecutive) Bufe has been quite impressive.</p>
<p>In the long term this will be good news for Degussa although I do not see an effect in immediate earnings prospects. It seems they can be on an equal footing in this co-operation. For them it means a major change from a financial investor to a strategic investor.</p>
<p>This could be an example of how such co-operation could work in the German corporate sector, not like the hostile Thyssen/Krupp story but an agreed co-operation. For Veba it is also nice as it means at some stage they could take a higher stake by perhaps transferring non-cash assets to Degussa."</p>
