<p>The Polish zloty firmed slightly against the basket of currencies in early trade on light currency selling trend based on inflows from currency exchange bureaux, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the market became fragmented as some banks were slowing activity before the end of the year and have been only squaring positions with minute deals done with clients while some were selling currencies on the back of individual inflows.</p>
<p>"Banks are scaling down activity...and there are only deals to cover individual transactions with customers," one dealer at a Polish bank said.  </p>
<p>At 1010 GMT the zloty was quoted at 2.95/2.89 percent from the trading band centre, stronger than opening's 2.91/2.84 percent. It was at 2.8625/40 to the dollar against opening's 2.8625/55 and at 1.8405/10, up from 1.8415/25.</p>
<p>Some banks registered increased inflows of currencies from individuals which may add upward pressure on the zloty which has been already driven up to a new range of 2.9-2.7 percent from the parity rate by this month's money market shortage.</p>
<p>"Foreign currency inflows from individuals likely switching into zlotys because of Christmas shopping season caused a light currency-selling trend," said a dealer at a foreign bank here.  </p>
<p>One-day deposit rates eased as lenders started to slowly cut surpluses on reserve positions so far held at emergency high levels this months in anticipation of high outflows sparked by the holiday shopping season.</p>
<p>At 1040 GMT overnight rates were quoted at 20.5/22.0 percent, down from opening's 22.0/22.4 percent, tomorrow/next rates were at 20.5/22.0 percent, down from 22.00/22.45.</p>
<p>The central bank offered to drain 700 million zlotys off the market for one-day. At its previous such operation on December 11 it accepted bids at a maximum rate of 21.30 percent. -- Krzysztof Wojcik +48 22 653 9700</p>
