<p>Allied Irish Banks Plc said Tuesday it has a definitive agreement for its First Maryland Bancorp unit to acquire Dauphin Deposit Corp. for $43 a share, or $1.36 billion.</p>
<p>The bank holding company said the board of Dauphin Deposit, a Pennsylvania banking company with about $6.0 billion in assets, agreed to recommend the offer to its shareholders.</p>
<p>The acquisition will boost Dauphin's assets to $17 billion, making it one of the nation's top 50 banks.</p>
<p>Dauphin, based in in Harrisburg, Pa., operates 98 bank branches through its Dauphin Deposit Bank &amp; Trust Co. unit. It had profits of $71 million in 1996, up 8.0 percent over 1995.</p>
<p>"This acquisition represents a major strategic move by AIB Group which will enhance and enlarge our successful U.S. franchise," said Thomas Mulcahy, AIB Group Chief Executive.</p>
<p>"Dauphin Deposit is a high quality bank with a consistent record of strong profitability. It is a major bank in South-Central Pennsylvania with a leading market share in the region."</p>
<p>Allied Irish, a financial services company based in Dublin, Ireland, said Dauphin shareholders may elect to exchange each share they hold for $43 in cash or an equivalent value of Allied Irish's American Depositary Receipts.</p>
<p>Each ADR represents six ordinary shares of Allied Irish, which trade on the Dublin and London Exchanges. The ADRs fell 50 cents to $40.50 on the New York Stock Exchange in late trading.</p>
<p>Dauphin's stock surged $5.50 to $41, in late trading on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>In order to preserve the tax-free nature of the deal, no more than 49 percent of Dauphin shares will be converted into cash, Allied Irish said.</p>
<p>The acquisition is expected to close during the third quarter, subject to approval by Irish and U.S. regulators and Dauphin shareholders. Allied Irish said it will seek approval of its shareholders to buy up to 50 million of its shares in the open market, in connection with the transaction.</p>
<p>The company said it expects annual savings of up to $48 million within two years after the deal closes.</p>
<p>The deal is not expected to affect Allied Irish's earnings per share in 1997, before restructuring charges of $60 million, or $39 million after taxes. It will boost earnings "moderately" in 1998 and "significantly" after that, it said.</p>
<p>Christopher Jennings, chairman and chief executive of Dauphin, will become vice chairman and a director of First Maryland upon completion of the deal. He will report to Frank Bramble, First Maryland's CEO, Allied Irish said.</p>
<p>First Maryland is the parent of First National Bank of Maryland, The York Bank &amp; Trust Co. and First Omni Bank N.A.</p>
