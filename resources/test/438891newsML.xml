<headline>CRICKET-Vettori's future hinges on Fleming-Boock.</headline>
<text>
<p>HAMILTON, March 14 - Daniel Vettori's development as a left arm spinner of genuine class largely depends on how quickly new captain Stephen Fleming adjusts to the role of leading the New Zealand cricket team.</p>
<p>That is the opinion of Stephen Boock, the Otago left arm slow bowler, who played 30 tests for his country between 1978 and 1985.</p>
<p>Like most observers, Boock has been hugely impressed by 18-year-old Vettori, who became the youngest player in New Zealand test history when he appeared in the second test against England in Wellington last month.  </p>
<p>But Boock worries that a young captain and a general lack of experience within a largely youthful national side may impede the Northern Districts teenager's advancement.</p>
<p>Fleming, 23, entered the second test against Sri Lanka in Hamilton today with just two appearances as New Zealand captain behind him -- the third test loss to England in Christchurch last month and the big win over Sri Lanka earlier this week in Dunedin.</p>
<p>He will take time adjusting to, and feeling comfortable with, the extra responsibilities of captaincy, and Boock said it was natural there would be a settling in period.  </p>
<p>"Fleming will possibly develop as a leader and learn quickly. But he and Vettori need to become very close," Boock told NZPA.</p>
<p>"Fleming needs to be close to half a dozen players who are going to make up the core of the team for the next five to even 10 years.</p>
<p>"It is essential he knows what they are thinking and how they feel.</p>
<p>"There is little experience within the New Zealand side which at the moment is largely made up of a group of apprentices.  </p>
<p>""There is so little knowledge on the field, and Daniel, who is an exciting prospect, will have to be a fast learner."</p>
<p>Boock noticed one or two minor points to arise during the Kiwis' test victory over Sri Lanka in Dunedin which he believes have to be addressed.</p>
<p>He thought that at times Fleming's communication with Vettori was not what it could have been.</p>
<p>He also cites the field placement of Vettori at deep backward square leg when veteran offspinner Dipak Patel was operating at Carisbrook as something which had not been thought through properly.  </p>
<p>"He was taken away from the action when he should have been in it. He has to be in a position where he can communicate with Patel and so their paths cross at the end of every over.</p>
<p>"Without that sort of thing Daniel's progress may be inhibited; with them he will thrive."</p>
<p>Boock also believed that both Vettori and Patel were guilty of flattening their trajectory too readily once centurymaker Romesh Kaluwitharana started clubbing the ball freely on the fourth afternoon.</p>
<p>"They defended and retrenched too quickly, and the communication was poor.  </p>
<p>"It is not a criticism. After all, New Zealand won the test match by a handsome margin but there is no game in which you can't analyse things to improve on."</p>
<p>The presence of Patel, 38, in the side as Vettori feels his way on the international stage is important.</p>
<p>They have roomed together since Vettori was pitched into the test team five weeks ago, with Patel acting as a guardian figure, offering advice, encouragement and the wisdom of almost 20 years as a professional cricketer in England and New Zealand.</p>
<p>But Patel's international days are unquestionably limited.  </p>
<p>"I worry about who Daniel is going to learn from in the future," Boock said.</p>
