<p>Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories Ltd said Wednesday it received conditional approval from the Economic Development Corporation (EDC) and the Detroit city council to defer its Department of Housing and Urban Development mortgage loan.</p>
<p>Caraco said the agreement allows it to postpone payment until February 1999, or sooner if it reaches certain profitability levels. The loan is administered through the EDC.</p>
<p>Caraco said if the agreement were finalized it would allow it to proceed with Sun Pharma of India transactions.  If approved by the Reserve Bank of India, Sun Pharma has agreed to provide cash and technology to Caraco in exchange for 5.3 million shares of Caraco common stock and up to an additional 13.6 million shares over a five-year period.</p>
<p>The final agreements are expected to be finalized in August.</p>
<p>Sun Pharma is a pharmaceutical firm with products in neurology and psychiatry, cardiology, gastroenterology, oncology, and anti-infectives. Caraco makes generic drugs.</p>
