<p>The Philippine peso was pulled down on Wednesday by commercial demand for dollars, traders said.</p>
<p>The peso closed at 28.50 to dollar from the previous close of 28.15. Volume was higher at $81 million from $43 million.</p>
<p>"This was purely driven by commercial demand," a trader said, citing the central bank has clamped down on speculators by banning non-deliverable forward dollar sales for three months.</p>
<p>The central bank also lowered the limit on banks' long dollar position to 10 percent from 20 percent of their capital and raised the limit on short positions to 20 percent from 10 percent.  </p>
<p>A new ruling aimed to encourage banks to sell dollars did not help strengthen the peso, traders said.</p>
<p>"Banks' overbought position were still below the limit," a trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said the central bank kept its hands off the market even as the peso traded in the lower range of the expected band of 28/28.50.</p>
<p>The peso could still trade in the same band on Thursday since the market had almost normalised after it was effectively devalued over a week ago, dealers said.</p>
