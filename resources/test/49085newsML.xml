<p>Germany's Reemstma tobacco firm plans to boost output at its Ukrainian branch to 12-14 billion cigarettes a year in 1997 from 10 billion this year, a top company official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The three-year-old joint venture is aiming to expand its operation and has contracted a Swiss firm to build a new factory on the edge of Kiev next year at a cost of 25 million marks ($16.5 million).</p>
<p>"Our current factory is in the centre of Kiev, and the building is old and there is no room to expand," general manager Serhy Poliychyk told Reuters.</p>
<p>The company hopes eventually to produce 30-35 billion cigarettes a year, he added.</p>
<p>"It all depends on demand, and on our competition."</p>
<p>Poliychuk said Reemstma-Ukraine faces competition from B.A.T. Industries Plc, Philip Morris Cos Inc and R.J.Reynolds Tobacco Co.</p>
<p>Reemstma this week won a tender in Moldova giving it control of that former Soviet republic's tobacco industry.</p>
<p>Poliychuk said that Ukraine, with 52 million people, is one of the lowest tobacco consumers per head in eastern Europe.</p>
<p>"Hungary, with a population of 10 million people, smokes 24 billion cigarettes a year. Ukraine, during the good times when people could still buy whatever they wanted, bought 72 billion cigarettes a year," he said.</p>
