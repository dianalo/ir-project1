<p>The German government's proposed comprehensive tax reform should be fully implemented as soon as possible, Hans Olaf Henkel, president of the Federation of German Industry (BDI), said on Monday.</p>
<p>The tax reform, which Chancellor Helmut Kohl and opposition Social Democrat (SPD) leaders will discuss on Tuesday, is vital to secure jobs and reinforce German competitiveness, Henkel told journalists at the Hanover Industry Trade Fair.</p>
<p>The planned tax reform would sharply reduce corporate tax rates, but failure to implement it could further rattle Germany's reputation among foreign investors, who are already too reluctant to invest here, he said.</p>
<p>"A reduction of German enterprises' tax burden is indispensable, if German companies are to keep up with global competition," Henkel said.</p>
<p>Recent developments in the foreign exchange market, where the mark has weakened sharply against the dollar in the past half-year, have greatly eased conditions for German exporters, but that is the brightest spot in the economy, he said.</p>
<p>Domestic demand remains weak, and companies are hesitant to boost investment.</p>
<p>"Despite a relatively favourable starting point, it would be wrong, or at least too early, to speak of a broad and sustained economic upturn," Henkel said.</p>
<p>The planned tax cuts will bring down German industry's tax burden only to midfield in international comparison, he said.</p>
<p>Such international comparisons will become increasingly important as the European Commission plans to put greater emphasis on benchmarking as an economic policy tool, a trend Henkel endorsed for Germany as well.</p>
<p>"Every German auto maker knows precisely, which of his competitors is the cost leader, which produces the best quality," he said.</p>
<p>"It is high time that those responsible for Germany Inc -- above all policy makers and wage negotiators -- pay attention to foreign countries as demanded by globalisation."</p>
<p>The success of Germany's jobs creation efforts also lies in the full implementation of new wage agreements, Henkel said.</p>
<p>He rejected as "absurd" the suggestion of a 32-hour work week made last week by Klaus Zwickel, head of the IG Metall engineering workers' union.</p>
<p>"It is indisputable that the movement toward a 35-hour work week set in motion by IG Metall in the 1980s was an enormous boost to (manufacturing) costs in Germany, and contributed to a mass destruction of viable jobs," Henkel said.</p>
<p>"IG Metall is simply ignoring economic laws," he said.</p>
<p>The Alliance for Jobs idea advanced by Zwickel last year was also plagued by economic contradictions, Henkel said. Under the alliance, labour said it would settle for minimal wage increases in exchange for government and management efforts to halve unemployment by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Kohl said on Sunday at the fair that his government stands by the goal of halving unemployment.</p>
