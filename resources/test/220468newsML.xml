<p>The small rightwing Popular Party is willing to abstain in the parliamentary vote on the 1997 budget if its demands for fine-tuning the Socialist government's budget proposals are accepted, party sources said.</p>
<p>The party listed 19 specific recommendations including smaller minimum tax payments by shop owners and the abolition of a stamp duty.</p>
<p>The Socialist government's response to the PP's suggestions was not immediately known.</p>
<p>The budget is already certain to be passed in a vote on December 11 as the main opposition Social Democratic Party has said it would not block its passage.</p>
<p>The PP has 15 seats in the 230-seat parliament.</p>
