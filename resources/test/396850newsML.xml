<p>Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers, died of Cancer Saturday in New York, a spokesman for the union said.</p>
<p>Shanker, 68, who was elected president of the AFT in 1974, died at the Sloan-Kettering cancer centre at 1:10 p.m., the hospital said.</p>
<p>President Clinton said in a written statement he was "deeply saddened" by Shanker's death.</p>
<p>"Al spent his life in pursuit of one of the noblest of causes -- the improvement of our public schools. He challenged teachers to provide every child the very best education possible and made a crusade out of the need for educational standards," the president said.</p>
<p>"He believed, as I do, that children should not go through school without learning the basics of reading, writing and arithmetic." Clinton concluded.</p>
<p>Shanker led the 907,000-member AFT for 23 years as well as the union's flagship local, New York City's United Federation of Teachers, from 1964 to 1986.</p>
<p>The AFT represents elementary and secondary school teachers, school-related personnel, higher education faculty, nurses and other health professionals as well as state and local governmemt employees.</p>
<p>"Al Shanker was known to the public as an extraordinaril;y effective spokesman for public education, for teachers and for children ... He is irreplaceable," AFT secretary-treasurer Edward McElroy said Saturday.</p>
<p>Shanker gained national prominence during the 1960s when he led New York's teachers in a series of strikes that won them stronger rights and higher salaries.</p>
<p>In the past two decades, he provoked nationwide discussions on the best way to improve public education, championing the restructuring of schools and the setting of high national standards for student achievment that could match the records of other countries.</p>
<p>Shanker had been an adviser to U.S. presidents on education issues since the administration of Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>Born to Russian immigrant parents on Sept. 24, 1928, Shanker grew up in Long Island City in the borough of Queens and attended Stuyvesant High School and the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana. He later pursued a doctorate at Columbia University.</p>
