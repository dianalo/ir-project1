<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) stepped in to buy dollars late on Friday after the rupee touched a high of 35.84 against the U.S. unit, up from 35.86/87 opening, dealers said.</p>
<p>The spot market closed at 35.87/88 rupees to a dollar.</p>
<p>Dealers said the RBI appeared to be reluctant to intervene on Friday as the rupee remained strong despite political uncertainty sweeping the country.</p>
<p>In the absence of demand from RBI and traditional dollar buying state-run commercial banks, the rupee kept rising.</p>
<p>"The RBI is not there," a dealer said as the rupee touched 35.83/84 in early afternoon. "Longs are getting liquidated."</p>
<p>RBI began buying dollars at 35.85 level.</p>
<p>"They were buying small amounts to begin with but later became aggressive and bought large lots till 35.88," a dealer said. RBI's purchases on Friday were entirely from spot market.</p>
<p>"The fact remains that the rupee closed stronger today compared to March 31, when the rupee closed at 35.92," he said, referring to the first trading after the Congress Party dropped a bombshell that it was withdrawing vital support for the minority government of Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>Importers have not been hedging risk in the face of a steady rupee and exporters have been selling their forward dollars to take advantage of the prevailing premiums.</p>
<p>The rupee edged up against the forward dollar in the absence of RBI intervention, dealers said.</p>
<p>Premiums were range-bound despite some near-term forward dollar sale by term lending bank Industrial Development Bank of India, a dealer said.</p>
<p>The six month annualised forward dollar premium closed Friday at 6.80 percent compared to 6.92 percent previous close.</p>
