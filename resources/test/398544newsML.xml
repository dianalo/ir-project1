<p>The Indian government on Monday announced a dual pricing scheme for foodgrains sold under its subsidised Public Distribution System (PDS).  </p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda told parliament that for people below the poverty line (BPL), the government proposed to sell through the PDS both common and fine rice at 3.50 rupees per kg, and wheat at 2.50 rupees per kg.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda said that for those above the poverty line (APL), fine rice would be sold at 6.50 rupees per kg and super fine rice at 7.50 per kg. Wheat for the APL category would be sold at 4.50 rupees per kg.</p>
<p>He did not say when the new scheme would come into force.  </p>
<p>"The targetted public distribution system is primarily focused on the poor and will benefit 320 million people below the poverty line," Deve Gowda said in a statement.</p>
<p>He said the food subsidies under the scheme will cost about 80 billion rupees ($2.2 billion) a year.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda said that initially 10 kg of foodgrains would be issued every month to all families below the poverty line.</p>
<p>He said the PDS operations had been widely criticised for failing to serve the population below the poverty line, its urban bias and lack of transparent and accountable arrangements for delivery.</p>
<p>"The government proposes to streamline the PDS by targetting it on the poor by issuing special cards to families below the poverty line and selling essential articles under the PDS to them at specially subsidised prices," Deve Gowda said.</p>
