<p>Polish construction firm Espebepe will be saved from bankruptcy if it clinches a debt write-off deal with major creditors even though a small creditor has filed for Espebepe's bankruptcy, its president said.</p>
<p>Andrzej Hass told Reuters his firm would not fold even though  Stako Sp. zoo, a Krakow-based creditor of Espebepe, filed for the construction firm's bankruptcy on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"A motion for the bankruptcy of our firm filed by Stako will not cause us to declare bankruptcy because these debts are disputable," Hass said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Hass said that if creditors refused to write-off 95 percent of Espebepe's 74.6-million-zloty debt when the two sides met on Friday, the firm would file for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>"If on Friday we will not make an agreement with the creditors, then Espebepe's management will file for bankruptcy," he said.</p>
<p>Hass said a plan which envisioned Espebepe issuing convertible bonds was not realistic because there was not enough time.</p>
<p>He said that if the write-off deal came through, and Espebepe received new orders while reducing its workforce by some 300 employees, the firm could break even in 1997.</p>
