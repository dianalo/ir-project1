<p>South Korea on Thursday urged Taiwan to cancel a contract that a state-run firm has signed with North Korea to ship nuclear waste to the Stalinist state, Foreign Ministry officials said.</p>
<p>"We cannot help but express deep regret over Taiwan signing the contract with North Korea, which has no transparency in the treatment of nuclear wastes," a senior ministry official said.</p>
<p>"We are again urging Taiwan not to go ahead with the contract," he added.</p>
<p>State utility Taiwan Power Co said on Monday it had signed a deal with a North Korean state trading firm to ship it 60,000 barrels of nuclear waste within two years, with an option to ship North Korea up to 200,000 barrels of nuclear waste.</p>
<p>"The agreement was made despite our previous requests that Taiwan stop pursuing its plan to transfer the waste to North Korea, which may not have proper safety facilities," the official said.</p>
<p>He said South Korea feared the deal could pollute the Korean peninsula with radioactive waste.</p>
<p>North Korea caused international uproar with its nuclear programme in the early 1990s. The United States and others said they suspected the programme was designed to develop weapons.</p>
<p>Pyongyang agreed to freeze and eventually abandon the programme in a 1994 nuclear agreement signed with Washington, which promised to provide the North $4.5 billion in nuclear technology and interim energy.</p>
