<p>Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei blasted on Monday Afghanistan's hardline Taleban movement as "un-Islamic" and said it was backed by the United States.</p>
<p>"In Iran's neighbourhood, unfortunately, un-Islamic and unacceptable deeds are done in the name of Islam by a group whose knowledge of Islam is questionable," Khamenei was quoted as saying by state-run Tehran radio.</p>
<p>Khamenei, who was addressing clergymen in Tehran, criticized what he called U.S. support for the Taleban. The group captured the Afghan capital Kabul last month and has taken control of about two-thirds of the country, imposing strict Islamic code.</p>
<p>"Not only did Americans not condemn them (Taleban) but they also stood behind them...Some politicians implied the purpose of American support for that group was to confront Iran," Khamenei said.</p>
<p>Shi'ite Moslem Iran has supported the ousted government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani and was hostile to the Sunni fundamentalist Taleban. Iran's media has accused the Taleban of being manipulated by Pakistan and the United States.</p>
<p>Pakistan denies charges from Afghanistan's ousted government that Islamabad gave military help to the Taleban.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said prospects for peace in Afghanistan were poor without a broad-based government in Kabul.</p>
<p>"Any government, any new government in Afghanistan should be a broad-based government. No ethnic group can run that country without an active contribution from the other ethnic groups. And no religious group can run the country without a contribution from the others," Velayati said.</p>
<p>"We are not very optimistic about the future of Afghanistan if this trend continues," he said in comments broadcast on Iranian television.</p>
<p>"So we have to think about a comprehensive peaceful settlement for Afghanistan. We do hope that the people of Afghanistan can decide about their own destiny without any foreign intervention," Velayati said.</p>
