<p>Comments from a top Japanese finance official on Friday may have been aimed at stemming capital outflows from Japan, but analysts in London said bond investors would continue to look for higher yields elsewhere.</p>
<p>Eisuke Sakakibara, director general of the Japanese finance ministry's international finance bureau said in an interview with Reuters that Japanese government bonds (JBGs) were very bubbly -- and the bubble could burst.</p>
<p>"With JGB yields as low as they are, insurers are more or less obliged to go elsewhere in order to meet the commitments they have already made," said Sean Shepley, international economist at CS First Boston here.</p>
<p>The benchmark 182nd three percent 2005 JGB is currently yielding 2.150 percent.</p>
<p>Kenjiro Hata, president of Meiji Mutual Life Insurance Co said earlier it may increase its foreign bond investments if there are no sharp movements in foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>Shepley said in the last few years the focus in Japan had been on encouraging capital outflow to keep the current account surplus in order, and to weaken the yen. But now, he said, those moves have gone too far.</p>
<p>Sakakibara also said it would be natural for the BoJ to raise interest rates when it had confirmed the strength of the economy. He said many people were dissatisfied with current interest rate levels and the political mood had to be taken into account.</p>
<p>Japan's key interest rate, the ODR, has been at a rock bottom 0.5 percent since late 1995, in an attempt to boost the fragile economic recovery.</p>
<p>Andrew Davies, bond analyst at London Bond Broking said Sakakibara was also attempting to divert JGB holders into the stock market, which would in turn give a leg up to the troubled banking sector.</p>
<p>"If there is a rate rise, it won't be until the second half of the year," he said.</p>
<p>While there has been a pick up in domestic activity, Shepley said it was questionable whether that would continue under tighter monetary policy.</p>
<p>"The only way to square that would be an aggressive change in fiscal policy," he said.</p>
<p>Adam Chester, international bond strategist at Yamaichi International (Europe) in London, said investors would only put up with yields around the 2.0 percent level if there were going to be 15 percent yen appreciation over the next year -- and the yen still has further to fall.</p>
<p>"Sakakibara's rate talk is purely an attempt to talk up the yen," said Chester. "If rates rise it would be a disaster for the banking sector. Banks are relying on the JGB yield being steep, so they can raise cheap money in the money markets and put it into the long end to make about 1.5 percent."</p>
<p>He said the curve was already flattening as a result of the weight of funds moving it.</p>
<p>"For those domestic investors looking abroad, Treasuries are the obvious choice, and other dollar bloc bonds such as Canada and Australia," he said.</p>
<p>However, he said there were some worries that investors who continue to move abroad into Treasuries are facing a currency risk because of the sharp dollar appreciation.</p>
<p>"If the dollar falls, then sterling will follow, so gilts are out as well," he said. "But if you aren't too worried about the effects of EMU (European Economic and Monetary Union) then Bunds could be interesting, given that yen/mark has been reasonably steady."</p>
