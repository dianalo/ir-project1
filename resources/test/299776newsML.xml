<headline>Computervision cuts sale terms of OSS unit.</headline>
<dateline>BEDFORD, Mass. 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Computervision Corp said Friday it was cutting the cash price of its OSS business to $65 million because the unit's third and fourth quarter revenues and profits fell short by about $0.12 per share.</p>
<p>The Open Service Solutions business, which will be renamed CV Services International Inc, is being sold to an investment group headed by J F Lehman &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Revised terms were $65 million in cash, $25 million in preferred stock of CV Services, and warrants to buy common shares representing 16 percent of the business, Computervision said.</p>
<p>The original terms were $100 million in cash, $25 million in preferred stock, and warrants to buy common shares representing 19 percent of CV Services.</p>
<p>Computervision said any gain from the sale would be "significantly offset" by shut-down costs associated with the sale.</p>
