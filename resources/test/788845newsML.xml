<p>Swedish drug company Astra AB said on Friday that its sales rose 13 percent to 21.47 billion crowns in the first half of 1997 with North American markets showing the strongest growth while European markets were mixed.</p>
<p>The company posted a pre-tax profit of 7.01 billion crowns in the first six months, a four percent rise which was slightly lower than market expectations of 7.18 billion crowns.</p>
<p>But Astra's share price slumped on the report, falling to 143 crowns before recovering to seven crowns below Thursday's close at 145.5 crowns at 1020 GMT.</p>
<p>"The pre-tax was a little lower than expected but it seems to be the operating profit that is most down on expectations," said one analyst.</p>
<p>Astra posted an operating profit of 6.75 billion crowns against 6.30 billion crowns in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Financial income was lower at 260 million crowns against 464 million, mainly due to lower interest rates. Exchange rate differences wiped 94 million crowns off earnings versus 17 million crowns a year ago.</p>
<p>Astra said its sales rose 13 percent or, calculated at constant exchange rates, six percent.</p>
<p>Astra said its sales in Europe rose slightly to 11.66 billion crowns from 11.22 billion crowns a year ago.</p>
<p>Sales rose nine percent in Germany, eight percent in Italy and 12 percent in The Netherlands but slipped 14 percent in Britain mainly as a result of parallel trade and fell 22 percent in Sweden, largely due to stockpiling and to parallel imports from southern Europe.</p>
<p>In North America sales rose to 6.33 billion crowns from 4.81 billion crowns which Astra said, calculated at constant rates, was a rise of 18 percent.</p>
<p>"A large part of the group's sales growth is now derived from North America, where several of Astra's products are expected to have substantial further potential," Astra said.</p>
<p>Sales of its largest product, the anti-peptic ulcer agent Losec rose to 14.72 billion crowns worldwide from 11.78 billion crowns a year ago.</p>
<p>Astra's own sales of Losec, which it markets jointly as Prilosec in the U.S. with Merck Inc, rose to 10.12 billion crowns from 8.55 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Sales of the antiasthma agenct Pulmicort rose eight percent to 2.48 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Astra said its beta-blocker Seloken, its largest product in the cardiovascular area, rose to 19 percent to 1.48 billion crowns and was showing rapid growth mainly due to a favourable trend in the United States.</p>
<p>Astra said price changes did not affect sales growth.</p>
<p>Sales growth during the second quarter was 16 percent which was higher than in the first quarter.</p>
<p>"1997 is a tricky year with a lot of technical effects that are influencing the market, for example the currency and stockpiling," Astra spokesman Staffan Ternby told Reuters after the report.</p>
<p>"It's hard to say exactly how the underlying trend is going but we are confident sales growth is on its way to recovery."</p>
<p>Research and development costs rose 22 percent in the first half to 3.99 billion crowns.</p>
