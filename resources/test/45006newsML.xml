<headline>RTRS-No initial OK on Telstra sale - Senator.</headline>

<text>
<p>Key Australian Independent senator Brian Harradine said on Tuesday he would not vote for the privatisation of Telstra Corp as the government proposes it, without his proposal to use redeemable preference shares.</p>
<p>"Well its a 'no' in the first instance," Harradine said when asked whether he would. "It may be a 'no' in the second."</p>
<p>He did not make clear what the second instance might be.</p>
<p>The Senate can vote on a bill twice.</p>
<p>If it rejects a bill once, it can be brought back to the upper house three months later in identical form but backed with the threat of an early election if it is rejected again.  </p>
<p>The government's plan to sell a third of Telstra relies on the vote of Harradine and another Independent senator, Mal Colston.</p>
<p>All other non-government senators oppose the plan and the ruling Liberal-National coalition is two votes short of a majority.</p>
<p>Preference shares are an asset part-way between equity and debt. Instead of dividends, the holder is paid interest.</p>
<p>If the company is wound up, the holder has preference over ordinary shareholders.  </p>
<p>Redeemable preference shares can be redeemed for value, under specified conditions.</p>
