<p>Germany's manufacturing sector continued to expand in June with price pressures mounting amid rising demand and the weakness of the mark, according to the BME/Reuters German Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI).</p>
<p>The pace of growth in the manufacturing sector was slightly slower than in May but was the second strongest monthly improvement recorded since the survey began in April 1996, research group NTC Publications Ltd said in a statement.</p>
<p>The index, available exclusively through Reuters, fell to a seasonally-adjusted 56.83 in June from 57.77 in May, revised from an originally reported 57.49.</p>
<p>"Prices rose for the fifth month running, with an acceleration in the rate of increase," NTC said. The rising incidence of supply bottlenecks often resulted in suppliers successfully pushing up prices.</p>
<p>"These demand-driven price pressures, combined with the increased cost of imported materials arising from the weakness of the Deutschmark, pushed average input prices higher."</p>
<p>It added that fears of further price rises and shortages prompted further building of safety stocks. Stocks of purchases rose for the second month running.</p>
<p>The price index component of the PMI rose to a seasonally-adjusted 57.74 in June from 55.98 in May.</p>
<p>The index is based on a survey of 350 companies carried out by NTC in cooperation with the BME German Association for Materials Management, Purchasing and Logistics.</p>
<p>A reading below 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally declining, while a level above 50 percent shows it generally expanding. The more it deviates from 50, the greater the improvement or decline in the current month.</p>
<p>NTC also said the incidence of firms cutting staff to reduce costs had fallen significantly over the past two months in line with the sustained growth of order books.</p>
<p>"However, employment nevertheless fell slightly in June as the majority of companies remained reluctant to take on new staff."</p>
