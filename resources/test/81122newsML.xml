<p>Engineering stocks, usually far from the spotlight on the Czech capital market, are gaining favour with local analysts and investors.</p>
<p>They point to the performance of Prague tram maker CKD Praha a.s. as just one of many examples of the new-found interest in the sector.</p>
<p>CKD Praha shares have doubled in the past two months and analysts say the ride should continue.</p>
<p>CKD, which also makes locomotives and other machinery, closed up 11 crowns at 421 on the Prague Stock Exchange on Friday, after hovering between 130-200 crowns for months.</p>
<p>"Considering the perspective of future growth, the current price of the company is still undervalued. We recommend to buy the stock at least up to 450 crowns," said Petr Hajek, an analyst with Zivnostenska Banka a.s..</p>
<p>The company returned to profitability in 1995 after five years of losses.</p>
<p>Analysts said extensive receivables in Russia, once exceeding three billion crowns, have hampered results, though the firm has managed to recover around half of that total.</p>
<p>Hajek said that while he expects to recover more of the funds, realistically, the firm may post a two billion crown loss this year in order to clean up its books.</p>
<p>But this fails to deter analysts such as Tomas Navratil of AKRO Capital who sees expansion opportunities for the company in replacing the popular, but outdated, red and white trams which cruise the streets of most Czech cities and towns.</p>
<p>Eastern Moravian firm ZPS Zlin a.s. also appears to be on the fast track, rising 40 percent in the past five months to close at 1,660 on Friday.</p>
<p>Experts said this may be only a reflection of position building by one of the current shareholders. Savings bank Ceska Sporitelna a.s. holds 14 percent of the firm, and its investment fund has another 13 percent stake.</p>
<p>"The strong side of the company is the ability to supply high quality products for reasonable price," said Blanka Houhova of the brokerage BH Securities, adding that the copmpany will be largely dependent on the crown exchange rate as it exports most of the production.</p>
<p>Analysts consider ZDAS a.s. one of the few black sheep in the sector, mainly because of poor developments in its trading policies.</p>
<p>"The business policy of the company is less deft (than CKD's and ZPS'), proven by the effects some unsuccessful deals had on last year's profit," Houhova told Reuters.</p>
<p>ZDAS, the supplier of large investment packages for iron and steelmills, was badly hit by the loss of eastern markets after the end of communism.</p>
<p>While the company posted a 101 million crown net profit in 1994, last year it dropped to less than one fifth of that figure. The trend has continued this year, with gross profits down to 27 million crowns in the first half of 1996 from 80 million in the same period of the last year.</p>
<p>ZDAS shares have lost two-thirds of their value since the beginning of 1995, closing at 595 crowns on Friday.</p>
<p>But analysts say the future is not all that black for ZDAS, with the possibility of large orders in sight from the country's steel mills, which are expected to soon begin their awaited modernisation.</p>
