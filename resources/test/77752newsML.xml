<p>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Thursday voiced confidence that another shutdown of the U.S. government will be avoided.</p>
<p>"I can't imagine that anyone wants to experience a shutdown," he told reporters. One possibility is that Congress and the Clinton administration will agree on an omnibus spending bill before the October 1 start of the new fiscal year, he said.</p>
<p>"If that didn't happen, you'd obviously have some kind of a short-term C.R. (Continuing Resolution) to carry you through until the final deal is worked out," Rubin said.</p>
