<p>Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed concern on Wednesday at recent developments in the West Bank town of Hebron, the scene of several days of clashes between Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli troops, and called on all sides to refrain from provocative acts.</p>
<p>"The secretary-general is following with concern recent developments in Hebron," a statement issued by a spokesman said. "He calls for an immediate end to the violence and appeals for maximum restraint.</p>
<p>"In the secretary-general's view, the tragic events of the past few days underline the urgent need for confidence to be restored, for all sides to refrain from provocative acts and for conditions to be created in which the peace process can be resumed," the statement added.</p>
<p>Israel handed 80 percent of Hebron over to Palestinian rule in January under an interim peace deal but kept troops in parts of the town to protect Jewish enclaves.</p>
<p>The clashes, in which scores of Palestinians and several Israelis have been wounded, involve Palestinian youths hurling stones and gasoline (petrol) bombs and Israeli troops firing rubber-coated bullets and teargas cannisters.</p>
