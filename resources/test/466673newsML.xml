<p>Irish bonds performed well across the yield curve in quiet trade on Tuesday with investors awaiting the conclusion of today's meeting of the U.S. Federal Reserve's rate-setting Open Market Committee Meeting, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The story's the same as yesterday - people are sitting on their hands," a dealer said. "Irish bonds are steady however, outperforming the UK, Germany, Sweden and Italy on the day."</p>
<p>The FOMC is widely expected to raise rates by 25 basis points by the conclusion of the meeting, with a Fed rate announcement expected around 1915 GMT.</p>
<p>A rate rise, the first for two years, could signal the turn of the international interest rate cycle, a bitter pill for the bond markets to swallow.</p>
<p>However dealers said they expected the impact on the Irish market to be minimal.</p>
<p>"If we get the expected quarter percent rise the impact will be slight - it's already well priced in - if anything, we may see a marginal bias to the higher," a dealer said.</p>
<p>"A half percent rise, on the other hand will suggest fear at the Fed and definitely push the market down."</p>
<p>The Irish market had been helped by an excellent CPI number last week, dealers said.</p>
<p>Investors would be looking ahead to U.S. payroll data next month for clues to further rises, dealers said.</p>
<p>Several traders said they were advising people to sell into any relief rally on the back of a rates rise.</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon Tuesday the spread on the Irish 10-year bond had narrowed to 97 basis points over Germany, dealers said.</p>
<p>By 1600 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was up 23 pence from Monday's close at 101.38 to yield 6.13 percent while the benchmark eight percent bond due 2006 was up 38 pence from the close at 107.75 to yield 6.84 percent.</p>
