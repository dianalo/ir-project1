<p>The Israeli shekel representative rate was fixed sharply lower against the dollar on Tuesday after the U.S. currency rallied to a 34-month high against the mark, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The shekel continued to decline against the dollar following the dollars rise against the mark and yen," said a dealer at Israel Discount Bank.</p>
<p>"The Bank of Israel had to intervene again in the market after the basket fell by more than seven percent below the diagonal rate," he added.</p>
<p>The central bank has been intervening regularly in the market to defend the currency basket rate, which has been trading at the bottom end of its band for nearly two months.</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.3630 shekels against 3.3530 on Monday. The basket, composed of the dollar, mark, pound sterling, French franc and yen, was fixed at 3.6454 shekels against 3.6450 on Monday.</p>
<p>On the crosses the shekel traded against the yen at 2.7606 shekels per 100 yen against 2.7791 on Monday and against the mark at 1.9681 shekels against 1.9805 on Monday.</p>
<p>In late afternoon the dollar was trading at 3.3615 shekels.</p>
