<p>An engineering expert, called as a witness by airline attendants suing the tobacco industry, testified on Monday that U.S. airlines rejected design changes that would have eased smoke pollution on airliners but also would have cost airlines billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Paul Halfpenny, an airline ventilation engineer, told jurors hearing a landmark secondhand-smoke trial in Miami that the design changes recommended in Boeing 737 and 747 aircraft would have reduced secondhand cigarette smoke and generally improved air quality.</p>
<p>However, the changes would have required the jets to consume hundreds of thousands of gallons more fuel each year. This would have cost $663 million annually for the U.S. fleet of 737s and more than $1.3 billion for 747s used by American airlines, Halfpenny said.</p>
<p>Halfpenny, who was called by lawyers pressing the $5 billion lawsuit on behalf of some 60,000 non-smoking flight attendants with alleged tobacco-related disorders, had commissioned studies of the proposed ventilation design changes.</p>
<p>He admitted during cross examination, however, that the changes would have yielded only small improvements in air quality and the only real solution to the problem of tobacco pollution aboard airplanes was to ban smoking.</p>
<p>"No matter what we did, it was always very difficult to prevent smoke from reaching the person beside you or behind you," the ventilation engineer said.</p>
<p>Smoking was banned on U.S. airliners in 1988, two years after a blue-ribbon panel of experts, including Halfpenny, recommended that regulators forbid cigarette use on jets.</p>
<p>Lawyers defending seven tobacco companies and two trade groups in the trial argue that the lung cancer, emphysema and other injuries to flight attendants allegedly caused by secondhand smoke were caused by exposure to other pollutants. They also contend that regulators and the airlines had the main responsibility for smoking on aircraft.</p>
<p>Edward Moss, an attorney representing Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco, won agreement from Halfpenny that maintenance of ventilation equipment by airline mechanics and practices such as flying with one of three air cleansers inoperative might have hurt the quality of air taken in by flight attendants.</p>
<p>Halfpenny also testified that secondhand smoke conditions worsened during recent decades as big jets moved away from ventilating with fresh air and instead relied on purifiers to recirculate air already aboard jets.</p>
<p>Ventilation, he said, consumes great amounts of energy and designers looked increasingly to recirculating the same air to save fuel.</p>
<p>Echoing testimony of a veteran mechanic and a pilot last week, Halfpenny said the parts of aircraft near air circulation vents were commonly coated with sticky tar residue from cigarettes in the years before smoking was banned.</p>
<p>The pilot said passenger seats in the 1980s were commonly stained with cigarette smoke, and the mechanic said aircraft machinery had to be routinely cleaned to remove smoke residues.</p>
<p>Now entering its third month, the trial of Norma Broin et al vs Philip Morris et al is expected to continue into late September. It is both the first trial of a secondhand-smoke claim and the first class-action suit against the tobacco industry to come to trial.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs attorneys are expected to call witnesses for several more weeks.</p>
