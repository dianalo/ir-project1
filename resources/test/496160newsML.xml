<p>Former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher hit the general election campaign trail on Wednesday, saying Labour leader Tony Blair was trying to take over her policies.</p>
<p>Asked if people were wrong to believe that Blair rather than Conservative Prime Minister John Major was her ideological heir apparent, Thatcher bristled and replied no.</p>
<p>"They have got the sex wrong. I think they have got the willpower wrong. I think they have got the reasoning wrong. I think they have got the strength wrong," Thatcher told reporters on the stump at a football ground in Aldershot southwest of London.</p>
<p>It was the first time that Thatcher, who was ousted from power in 1990, had appeared on the road in Britain's campaign for a May 1 election that Major is widely tipped to lose.</p>
<p>Never one to concede defeat, Thatcher took to the road hoping her steely charisma would help close Major's dogged double-digit lag in the polls.</p>
<p>The British media has often suggested that Thatcher admires Blair's leadership style and determination.</p>
<p>But Thatcher said Blair, who has moved Labour to the political centre ground, would hand back powers to the trade unions and to bureaucrats in Brussels if he were to win.</p>
<p>"He is trying to take over my policies in part. It's a kind of conversion of convenience. I had to make the revolution happen by changing everything I found in Britain," Thatcher said.</p>
<p>A Conservative spokesman welcomed her intervention, with less than a month to go before the poll.</p>
<p>"She is 100 percent supportive of the campaign and of Major -- her being out on the campaign trail just underlines it. She wants to see a Conservative victory as we all do," he said.</p>
<p>"She is an incredibly good campaigner. She was a superb prime minister and she's doing her bit, which is incredibly valuable."</p>
<p>As the longest-serving British prime minister this century, Thatcher won plaudits for her tough style and was dubbed "the only man in the cabinet" during the 1980s. Yet her strength only highlights the weak reputation that dogs her successor.</p>
<p>Critics say Thatcher's successor John Major lacks the charisma of the so-called "Iron Lady" and that his party seems tired of power as it descends into infighting instead of offering voters new ideas.</p>
<p>In Thatcher's heyday during the 1980s, the Conservatives revolutionised Britain -- shifting state industries into the private sector and crushing the power of the trade unions -- yet it was her dictatorial style of governing that eventually led to Thatcher's downfall as both party and public grew disillusioned.</p>
<p>Her support of Major has often come under question for while he was her hand-picked successor she has often damned him with faint praise and been quoted as heaping praise on Blair.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Thatcher sought to stop the rot by delivering a gung-ho message to Conservative candidates in London, applauding Major's "magnificent stewardship of the last six years".</p>
<p>An aide said she planned about nine trips on the trail to show her full support for the party.</p>
<p>Her return to political prominence also hoped to dispel speculation she would be happy with a government run by new-look Labour.</p>
<p>The aide vehemently denied Thatcher's decision actively to campaign followed a decision on Wednesday of local party activists in Tatton, northwest England, to support her long-time Conservative friend Neil Hamilton, who is mired in sleaze allegations.</p>
<p>"That story is complete and utter nonsense. Her support for the campaign is completely unconditional," he said. "She is fully supportive during the campaign and will be throughout."</p>
