<title>MALAYSIA: KL overnight stays soft on availability of funds.</title>
<headline>KL overnight stays soft on availability of funds.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-06-23</dateline>

<p>The overnight interbank rate fell slightly to 5.8/6.0 percent from 5.9/6.0 percent on Friday as availability of funds kept short term rates under pressure, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Right now, there's a bit of liquidity in the market and the overnight is being pressured," said a dealer at a Malaysian bank. "I think it will hover around 5.8 percent in the next couple of days."</p>
<p>But the overnight was unlikely to drop below 5.8 percent, a level widely accepted as Bank Negara's floor rate, dealers said.</p>
<p>Market liquidity had improved following recent lending by the central bank and last week's maturity of Bank Negara bills worth 1.5 billion ringgit which were not rolled over.</p>
<p>There will be another maturity of a 500-million ringgit bill issue this week.</p>
<p>But dealers said an outflow of some two billion ringgit on Thursday due to maturity of funds Bank Negara lent to the market to help ease market tightness last month, could prevent rates from falling back to levels of a month ago.</p>
<p>"We have to see what happens on Thursday. If it's true that amount of money is going out, rates should not fall much further," said one dealer.</p>
<p>Earlier, one-week money was at 7.30 percent against 7.50 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>One- and three-month money were at 7.60/70 percent against 7.70/80 percent.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were higher across the board, reflecting softening in cash interbank rates.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was up three points to 92.55, or an implied yield of 7.45 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract rose four to 92.66, or 7.34 percent and March 1998 was up three to 92.73, or 7.27 percent.</p>
