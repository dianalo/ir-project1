<p>Chaminda Vaas and Sajeeva de Silva each claimed two wickets as Sri Lanka had Pakistan struggling at 113 for four at tea on the second day of the second and final test on Sunday.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka had earlier taken their first innings total to 331 before they were all out shortly before lunch.</p>
<p>Vaas soon had Pakistan in trouble when he had opener Salim Elahi caught at slip for nought by Hashan Tillekeratne off the fourth ball he faced and then had Ijaz Ahmed taken at third slip by Russell Arnold for four.</p>
<p>Captain Ramiz Raja and Salim Malik attempted to repair the damage but both fell to left-arm paceman de Silva in his second spell of five overs which cost 13 runs.</p>
<p>Raja, who cracked six boundaries in a rapid 36 off 33 balls, went for another big hit and was caught at long leg by Arnold.</p>
<p>Malik played a half-hearted square cut and gave a simple catch to Sri Lankan captain Arjuna Rantaunga at gully. He made 24, which included four fours.</p>
<p>At tea Inzamam-ul-Haq was unbeated on 23 and Asif Mujtaba on 19.</p>
<p>Earlier Aravinda de Silva, who on Saturday held Sri Lanka together with a stylish century, continued where had left off when Sri Lanka resumed at their overnight 281 for seven.</p>
<p>He was left unbeaten on 138 and his 208-ball innings contained 15 boundaries. He and Vaas (17) added 76 runs for the eighth wicket, a record for Sri Lanka.</p>
