<p>Should the United States lose the Fed Cup to Spain by dropping Sunday's doubles, U.S. captain Billie Jean King will be forever second guessed for her decision to leave specialist Gigi Fernandez off the team.</p>
<p>"I hope the match is meaningless because we've already won," said Mary Joe Fernandez, who will team for doubles with Lindsay Davenport against the dynamic Barcelona-bred duo of Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Conchita Martinez.</p>
<p>Under King's master plan, Davenport will play singles, along with U.S. ace Monica Seles, as well as doubles against the three-time defending Cup champions.</p>
<p>Linda Wild is along for the ride as a reserve at the expense of Gigi Fernandez, perhaps the world's most accomplished active doubles player with a brilliant 19-2 Fed Cup record and 15 Grand Slam titles.</p>
<p>Unlike the men's Davis Cup format, which sandwiches doubles between the four singles matches, Fed Cup doubles can be even more critical as the fifth and potential championship-clinching match.</p>
<p>"I think it's a very close match. I think the doubles will be the decider," predicted Spanish captain Miguel Margets after Friday's draw. "We are prepared to have a long fight during the five matches."</p>
<p>In recent interviews King said Gigi Fernandez had been excluded for being contentious and disruptive, and for failing to have the team spirit necessary for the Fed Cup format.</p>
<p>It is also believed that Gigi's close off-court relationship with Spain's Martinez was a factor in King's decision.</p>
<p>King actually threw Gigi Fernandez off the team during the July semifinals in Japan after a row with the doubles diva.</p>
<p>But after she teamed with Mary Joe to win Olympic doubles gold this summer and followed that by winning the U.S. Open with regular partner Natasha Zvereva earlier this month, Gigi seemed a lock to make the team for the final.</p>
<p>King said she had no misgivings about her decision.</p>
<p>"Lindsay and Mary Joe have some experience playing together. They also won the French (Open) this year, and they are good friends," King said Friday, explaining her doubles strategy.</p>
<p>But with Gigi on the team, King could have fielded an entirely fresh pair against Sanchez and Martinez, who will have played singles matches earlier in the day.</p>
<p>"If it comes down to it we'll be ready to play and it's going to be an exciting match," promised Mary Joe.</p>
<p>"Arantxa and Conchita always play well for their country and Lindsay's playing great."</p>
<p>It will take a great effort to stop the Spaniards if the doubles match is for all the marbles. As a team, Martinez and Sanchez are 15-3 in Fed Cup doubles with their last defeat way back in 1989.</p>
<p>Martinez was sure the Americans had made an error in judgment. "I think it's particularly a mistake leaving out the number two (doubles) player in the world from the Fed Cup team," she said.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean we are going to win the match, but leaving Gigi off the team is pretty unbelievable."</p>
<p>Asked what he thought of the U.S. decision to leave Gigi Fernandez home, Margets said: "I would love it if it was a mistake."</p>
