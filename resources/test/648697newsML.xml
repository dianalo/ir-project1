<p>An Air Malta plane with 85 people on board was hijacked to Germany early on Monday on a flight from Malta to Istanbul, German police said.</p>
<p>The Boeing 737 airliner carrying 79 adults, one child and five crew members landed unexpectedly at Cologne-Bonn airport at 4.47 a.m. (0247 GMT) and was standing in the freight section there, a police spokesman at the airport told Reuters.</p>
<p>It had been headed to Istanbul from Malta.</p>
<p>"Police have started a dialogue with the hijacker and I hope that will prove constructive," Heinz Gombel, chief executive of the airport, told reporters.</p>
<p>The police spokesman said a Turkish interpreter had been called to the airport, indicating the hijacker might be from Turkey.</p>
<p>One woman had been allowed to leave the plane because she had heart problems.</p>
<p>The hijacker requested that a television crew come to the plane to act as mediators, Gombel said.</p>
