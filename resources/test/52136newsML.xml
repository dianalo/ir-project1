<headline>TV Filme to apply for new Brazil channels.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-13</dateline>

<p>TV Filme Inc said Thursday that Brazil's Ministry of Communications has adopted new Pay TV regulations.</p>
<p>Based on a preliminary review, the company said the new regulations provide that companies operating multipoint, multichannel distribution systems in markets with more than 700,000 people, such as TV Filme, are entitled to utilize all 31 channels available in such markets, rather than the 16 previously available in most circumstances.</p>
<p>TV Filme said it intends to apply for the additional channels, as well as the extended coverage areas in its markets, which are expected to slightly increase the number of households covered by the Company's licenses.</p>
<p>These regulations also allow licensees to apply for extended service areas covering up to 50 km in radius, which represents a doubling of the 25 km limit set forth under the previous regulations.</p>
