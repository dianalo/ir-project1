<p>Former Australian international Abbas Saad said on Thursday he had signed with his old club UTS Olympic after soccer's world governing body overturned a life ban imposed on him for match-fixing.</p>
<p>Abbas, 28, was found guilty by a Singapore court in June last year of conspiracy in match-fixing when he played for Singapore in Premier League and Malaysia Cup matches in 1994.</p>
<p>Abbas, a Lebanese-born Australian, was fined US$40,000 and banned for life by the Singapore Football Association. That suspension was immediately extended worldwide by the sport's governing body, FIFA.</p>
<p>FIFA said on Tuesday its disciplinary committee had lifted the ban but gave no immediate explanation why it had done so. The ban remains in place in Singapore.</p>
<p>Abbas told reporters he had been "in the wrong place at the wrong time". The case also involved a former team-mate, Michael Vana, who fled Singapore for his native Czech Republic before he was due to appear in court.</p>
<p>"The nightmare is over. I'm so happy," Abbas said.</p>
<p>"I was very, very hurt. I'm still shocked. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and I was needed as a scapegoat."</p>
<p>Abbas said he had signed a one-year contract on Thursday with UTS Olympic in Australia's national soccer league.</p>
<p>"I've had a few offers overseas but my heart is with Olympic," he said.</p>
<p>He also said he hoped to force his way back into Australia's side as they attempt to qualify for the 1998 World Cup. Abbas played for Australia six times between 1989 and 1993.</p>
