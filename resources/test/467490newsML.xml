<p>A bi-polar international monetary system, dominated by a common European currency and the dollar, will emerge once monetary union gets underway, according to the likely conclusions of an EU report due in April.</p>
<p>In its first attempt to assess the international implications of economic and monetary union (EMU), the European Commission is expected in mid-April to put forward a cautionary position on the the single currency's future.</p>
