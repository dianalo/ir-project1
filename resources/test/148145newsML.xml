<p>General Motors Corp said Monday it has made significant progress in contract talks with the United Auto Workers and is committed to continuing the negotiations.</p>
<p>In a written statement in response to comments made by UAW president Stephen Yokich, GM's vice president of personnel Gerald Knechtel said the talks have been constructive.</p>
<p>"We have had open and constructive dialogue with the UAW since these talks began and have made significant progress on many of the issues," Knechtel said.  </p>
<p>Earlier, Yokich said he was disappointed with the talks, which recessed at 0300 EST/0800 GMT Monday. The union's deadline for an agreement had been midnight.</p>
<p>Negotiators were in discussions for about 17 hours on Sunday and early Monday in an attempt to agree on a new contract for about 215,000 UAW members working at GM's U.S. facilities.</p>
<p>Yokich said talks may resume later Monday, and Knechtel said the company remains committed to negotiations.</p>
<p>"We are committed to continuing the dialogue and resolving the remaining issues with the UAW," Knechtel said.</p>
