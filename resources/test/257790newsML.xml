<p>Canadian bonds closed much weaker in thin trade on Monday with spreads to U.S. bonds widening amid a weaker U.S. market, a softer dollar, and some profit taking by money managers, analysts said.</p>
<p>"It's just been a slow grind lower and lower," said Harvinder Kalirai, Canadian analyst with finanial analysis firm I.D.E.A. "There's was no real event to spark it. You could say that we were following the U.S. after they got industrial production numbers."</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark bond fell C$1.33 to C$108.87 to yield 7.242 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond fell 23/32 to yield 6.63 percent. The spread between the benchmark bonds widened to 61 basis points from 57 basis points at Friday's close.</p>
<p>Both Canadian and U.S. bonds were weaker after a report that U.S. industrial production rose a higher-than-expected 0.9 percent in November.</p>
<p>However, the Canadain situation was made worse by money managers selling to take profits on this year's sharp gains in bond prices, analysts said. Dealers said such selling is having a larger than normal impact because volumes in the Canadian market are very light.  </p>
<p>"There's a lack of liquidity and absolutely no buying," said Philip A. Strathy, chief investment officer with Strathy Investments Ltd.</p>
<p>Canadian bonds are also being hurt by weakness in the currency, analysts said. They said the two markets are in a vicious cycle, where currency weakness is prompting foreign investors to sell bonds, which prompts further weakness in the dollar.</p>
<p>"You have this weak debt market and weak currency still sort of feeding on each other," said I.D.E.A.'s Kalirai.</p>
