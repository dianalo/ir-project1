<p>Pope John Paul, bearing up well despite frail health, successfully skirted controversy on a four-day visit to France and confounded Roman Catholic fears of a damaging flood of protests.</p>
<p>The French Bishops' Conference hailed the visit sd a success after the 76-year-old Pontiff, on his fifth trip to mainland France, stressed compassion and solidarity with the poor, the sick and the needy rather than his strict moral teachings.</p>
<p>In one ceremony, he embraced an AIDS victim. And while he restated his opposition to abortion he avoided reiterating opposition to birth control, homosexuality or the use of condoms to help to prevent the spread of AIDS.</p>
<p>His last mass, at Reims in eastern France, drew 200,000 people, which a church spokesman said was the bigggest turnout ever for the Pontiff in a country where the number of Catholics has been declining steadily in recent years.</p>
<p>By comparison, the biggest anti-papal protest, called by an alliance of 70 mostly leftist groups, attracted only a few thousand people in Paris to denounce the Pope's moral teachings and accuse him of violating a 1905 law separating Church and State.</p>
<p>"The visit was a success in every aspect," said Olivier de la Brosse, spokesman for the French Bishops' Conference.</p>
<p>The Pope, on his last trip abroad before going into hospital next month to have his appendix removed, looked weary by the end of his visit but was in far better form than on a brief trip to Hungary earlier this month.</p>
<p>In a sign that he felt in relatively robust form, he made several unscheduled stops to greet people lining his route. Cardinals said he spoke freely of the day when he would die but said he would stay in office until then.</p>
<p>"There is no fear in the face of the void," said Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, the archbishop of Paris, saying the Pope spoke of death with a smile. The media had been full of speculation that he would cancel the trip due to ill health.</p>
<p>Before his arrival, an unpredecented rash of anti-papal protests had worried both the church hierarchy and French security services mindful that in Berlin in June he had received his worst reception for years.</p>
<p>Hundreds of German anarchists yelled "Go to Hell" and two bags of paint splattered onto the popemobile as he drove past.</p>
<p>Two weeks before the Pope arrived in France, a crude bomb was defused in a church on his scheduled route. In another incident, a gang of custard-pie throwers broke into Nantes Cathedral and knocked a priest to the ground.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people wrote to their bishops to ask to be struck off baptism lists. Yet protests during his trip, including two in Reims, were low-key and peaceful amid discreet but draconian security.</p>
<p>About 45 million of France's 58 million people are nominally Roman Catholic but only about six million attend church regularly. Opinion polls said most people were indifferent to the Pope's visit.</p>
<p>By preaching solidarity with people on the margins of society, the Pope may hope to recapture ground from Jacques Gaillot, a bishop sacked last year for his liberal views on issues such as homosexuality or condoms.</p>
<p>Gaillot, transferred from a Normandy diocese to a non-existent ancient seat in the Sahara Desert, has turned to preaching for the poor and the homeless on the Internet computer network.</p>
<p>The Pope posted a special message on the Internet while in France and urged bishops to work on communication.</p>
