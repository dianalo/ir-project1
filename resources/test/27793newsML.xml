<p>The Central Bank of Jordan said on Monday it was offering banks 15 million dinars in certificates of deposits in this week's auction.</p>
<p>Interest yields released on Monday from last week's auction for three-month paper were unchanged at 9.250 percent.</p>
<p>Yields on six-month certificates were fixed at 9.500 percent, also unchanged from last week's rate.</p>
<p>Outstanding CDs dropped slightly to 527.7 million dinars from 528.1 million dinars last week, with few maturing CD's returning to the market.</p>
<p>Repurchase agreements as collateral to weekly CDs remained at a high 10 percent with an unchanged 8.5 percent discount rate.</p>
<p>The Central Bank is maintaining a high interest rate policy to preserve the attractiveness of dinar-denominated assets to boost the local currency.</p>
<p>It also wants to curb any excessive outflow of dinars into dollar-denominated assets that could erode its foreign currency reserves.</p>
<p>$=0.7080 dinar</p>
