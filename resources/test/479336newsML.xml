<p>Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said Tuesday that a proposal for the Connecticut Lottery Corp to operate a bingo game would violate state law.</p>
<p>"Bingo games can only be operated by charitable groups that are specifically outlined in state law," Blumenthal said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The lottery is not permitted under current state law to promote or operate this type of game."</p>
<p>The Connecticut Lottery Corp had planned to initiate an on-line bingo game.</p>
<p>Connecticut started its lottery game about 25 years ago, under the State Division of Special Revenue.</p>
<p>The lottery is now managed by the Connecticut Lottery Corp, a quasi-public group set up in July of last year.</p>
