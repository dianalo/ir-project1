<p>Standard &amp; Poor's Corp said on Wednesday it has assigned its AA minus rating to Citibank Ltd's A$500 million transferable certificate of deposit/medium term note programme. The rating outlook is stable.  </p>
<p>The rating is predicated on Citibank's ultimate ownership by, and integration with, the U.S.-based Citicorp group, the rating agency said.</p>
<p>The ratings are also supported by Citibank's solid business profile, sound asset quality and funding profile, above average profitability and capitalisation, and conservative liquidity and risk management policies, it said.</p>
<p>Citicorp, rated A plus/A1, is the parent of Citibank N.A., New York, rated AA minus/A1 plus, which in turn owns Citibank Ltd, the largest foreign-owned bank operating in Australia.  </p>
<p>The outlook reflected the outlook assigned to the parent company, Citicorp, and the strength and financial flexibility that Citibank derives from its Citicorp group membership, S&amp;P added.</p>
