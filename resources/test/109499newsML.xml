<p>Portugal's cabinet on Thursday approved a draft of its 1997 budget proposals that include a pledge not to raise taxes and a forecast the government will meet the deficit target for joining a single European currency.</p>
<p>"This proposal foresees a reduction in the budget deficit to 2.9 percent of GDP in 1997," Presidency Minister Antonio Vitorino told reporters.</p>
<p>Portugal is trying to meet the European Union's requirement for it to cut its budget deficit to three percent of GDP in 1997 in order to qualify to join the single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>The government expects Portugal's budget deficit to stand at around four percent in 1996 after 4.9 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>"There will not be increases in direct or indirect taxes (in 1997)," Vitorino said, reiterating an earlier commitment by Finance Minister Antonio Sousa Franco.</p>
<p>The Socialist government of Prime Minister Antonio Guterres plans to present its 1997 budget proposals to parliament on October 15. Analysts expect it to be passed next month.</p>
<p>"The budget aims to continue the reduction of public debt in relation to GDP," Vitorino said.</p>
<p>"The budget will give priority to public investment and the rigorous containment of current spending," he added.</p>
<p>The draft budget proposals will be presented to opposition political parties on Friday for discussion, Vitorino said.</p>
