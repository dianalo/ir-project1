<headline>IPE gas oil ends lower but sentiment still bullish.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-04</dateline>

<p>IPE Oct gas oil closed softer on Friday but off the session low as persistent bullish sentiment curbed profit-taking, brokers said.</p>
<p>"There's been some selling on Oct, but Nov finished strong which shows the fundamentals of this market are still good," said one IPE floor broker.</p>
<p>Oct gas oil closed $1.25 down at $245.50 a tonne, while the Nov contract climbed $1 to close just off the session high at $235.50.</p>
<p>The front-month backwardation narrowed by $2.25 to $10 a tonne, having dipped below $9 earlier.  </p>
<p>Some traders said they were selling Oct gas oil ahead of the expiry of the contract next Thursday.</p>
<p>IPE Nov Brent rebounded shortly after the gas oil close as a rally in NYMEX heating oil led the market up.</p>
<p>"Heating oil is picking up again, they're expecting some cold wether over there this weekend," a broker said.</p>
<p>Nov Brent was trading at $23.75 a barrel by 1655 GMT, one cent up on the day and off an intra-day low of $23.48.</p>
