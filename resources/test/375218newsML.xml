<p>The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) said on Thursday its seven-day reverse repurchase tender averaged 14.95 percent, down from 16.74 percent in the last similar auction, adding this was a signal to the market.</p>
<p>"This time we gave an interest rate signal that we are pressing our yields gradually down...it is impossible to set the floor...according to this decision the ceiling today is the maximum accepted bid in the tender today -- 15.5 percent," Peter Andresic, head of the NBS's Open Market Operation Department, told Reuters.</p>
