<p>Two male players died and a teenage girl received spinal injuries in separate accidents in rugby league matches in suburban Sydney on Sunday, authorities said.</p>
<p>Australian Rugby League (ARL) spokesman John Brady told reporters a 16-year-old was had died after being injured in a tackle while playing in a match in the inner Sydney suburb of Birchgrove.</p>
<p>The teenager, whose name was not released, appeared to have suffered a fit shortly after being tackled and was treated by paramedics at the scene.</p>
<p>He was taken to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, where an ambulance spokesman said he died shortly after arrival.</p>
<p>The second fatality came during a match at Harbord on Sydney's northern beaches. A 26-year-old man who was playing in his second match of the afternoon collapsed shortly after making a tackle.</p>
<p>An ambulance spokesman said the man had apparently suffered a cardiac arrest and was treated at the ground but later died in hospital. His name was also not released.</p>
<p>"Obviously anybody in the game regrets these deaths but this sort of thing is extremely rare," Brady said.</p>
<p>"Until doctors complete their investigations, we cannot be sure they're even related to the game. All we can say is that it is a tragedy for two families," he said.</p>
<p>An ambulance spokesman told reporters a 17-year girl suffered a spinal injury while playing in a women's rugby league match in Bankstown in Sydney's west.</p>
<p>The teenager had apparently suffered bruising to the lower spinal column but appeared to have escaped serious injury, the spokesman said.</p>
