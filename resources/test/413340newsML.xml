<title>NEW ZEALAND: NZ SPORT-CRICKET-Final chance for NZ batsmen in 5th ODI.</title>
<headline>NZ SPORT-CRICKET-Final chance for NZ batsmen in 5th ODI.</headline>
<text>
<p>AUCKLAND, March 3 - New Zealand have one final chance to get their undisciplined batting lineup in shape if they want to square the one-day cricket series against England at the Basin Reserve in Wellington on Tuesday.</p>
<p>When New Zealand pulled England's lead back to 2-1 in the five-game series -- the third match in Napier was tied -- it was entirely due to the sterling work of their bowlers and fielders.</p>
<p>Once again the batsmen failed to deliver.</p>
<p>New Zealand were bowled out for 153, squandering a promising 113 for two in the 26th over of the 43-over match.  </p>
<p>Eight wickets fell in 82 balls for the addition of just 40 runs.</p>
<p>Two were run out, two fell to leading edges in one over from offspinner Robert Croft, one drove at a wide delivery, another popped an easy catch to mid off while the tail-enders had no chance against good, full length deliveries.</p>
<p>"The batting has only done it once out of four times so far in the series," captain Lee Germon said last night.</p>
<p>"That was at Auckland (in the second match) when we got 250 and that was down to Chris Cairns scoring 80.</p>
<p>"We do need to keep working on the batting."  </p>
<p>Germon didn't believe a sense of panic set in yesterday and the players became over-eager to get quick runs in the middle stages of their innings.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, New Zealand batting collapses have been a regular feature of the home season.</p>
<p>There were four significant mid-innings flops in six innings during the three-test series against England, while the one-day form has scarcely been a cause for celebration.</p>
<p>New Zealand coach Steve Rixon said England had shown their batting frailties as well in the one-dayers.  </p>
<p>"They've collapsed every time they've had the opportunity, just as we have -- but we've set targets that were more gettable," he said.</p>
<p>"We know what we've got to do, we'll go about our match plan, and concentrate a bit harder.</p>
<p>"Now we've got a base, we know how to win a game."</p>
<p>The bowlers did an excellent rescue job for New Zealand yesterday.</p>
<p>New ball pair Heath Davis and Geoff Allott, although not particularly inexpensive, each chipped out two wickets to have England 41 for four in the ninth over.  </p>
<p>Then Gavin Larsen, Chris Harris, Nathan Astle and Simon Doull combined to choke off the run supply as Alec Stewart and Craig White set about a rescue mission, adding 50 for the fifth wicket.</p>
<p>After Astle and Harris nipped out those two batsmen, Larsen grabbed three wickets with his last eight deliveries -- along with Robert Croft's run out -- to keep New Zealand afloat in the series.</p>
<p>But that win had nothing to do with the New Zealand batsmen, who again showed an inability to kick on from a sound start.  </p>
<p>Openers Bryan Young and Astle got 53 in 65 balls, then Astle and Stephen Fleming put on a further 59 in 84 balls for the third wicket.</p>
<p>England led the series 2-0 and seemed sure to take a one-day series win home to go with their 2-0 test victory.</p>
<p>Now they've got some work to do after the tied match in Napier and yesterday's defeat.</p>
<p>"The tour is winding down a little. We've got one game to raise ourselves for before we go home and we're keen to wrap up the series in Wellington," captain Mike Atherton said last night.  </p>
<p>But Atherton was quick to point out his team hadn't gifted away a 2-0 lead.</p>
<p>"There's two teams playing and there's no divine right to win," he added.</p>
<p>"If you play a bit below par, as we did when we batted today, you give New Zealand a chance.</p>
<p>"They took that chance today."</p>
<p>England opener Nick Knight is out of the tour after breaking his left index finger on the first ball of the England innings yesterday.</p>
<p>It's likely batsman John Crawley will return in his place.  </p>
<p>Fast-medium bowler Dominic Cork missed yesterday's game with a twinge in a leg.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether he will be fit for tomorrow's match.</p>
<p>The game will be watched by a sellout crowd of about 13,000.</p>
<p>The umpires are Evan Watkin of Wellington and Dunedin's Steve Dunne with Christchurch's Dave Quested the third official.</p>
