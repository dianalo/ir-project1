<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin helped allay new fears about his health when he met Frenc President Jacques Chirac as scheduled on Sunday a day after missing a late-night summit entertainment show.</p>
<p>"It's good to see you in good shape," Chirac told the 66-year-old Yeltsin, who underwent open heart surgery last year. "When I see you I'm always in a good mood."</p>
<p>Spokesmen insisted there was nothing wrong with Yeltsin other than tiredness after arduous discussions with leaders of the Group of Seven big industrialised democracies who wind up their three-day annual summit in Denver later in the day.</p>
<p>"It is obvious that after the hard work of the two days, plus the altitude and the heat, the president required some extra rest," said Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzembsky. "In fact the other leaders could hardly fight off sleep."</p>
<p>Summit leaders from Russia and the G7 nations -- the United States, France, Britain, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan -- were to wrap up their meeting with a discussion of Hong Kong, China and the Middle East.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the captured Khmer Rouge strongman Pol Pot, held responsible for the deaths of up to two million Cambodians in the 1970s, was a summit topic and the United States believed he should face international justice.</p>
<p>"First of all, if he has been captured, just imagine what a great sense of justice and relief to have this man who was responsible for the killing fields of hundreds of thousands of people," she told ABC's "This Week" programme. She is to visit Cambodia this week on a previously scheduled trip.</p>
<p>Yeltsin looked fit and fully recovered from two heart attacks last year at the start of the summit on Friday. But he left a summit dinner at a restaurant 20 minutes early on Saturday night and skipped a musical variety show attended by other summit leaders.</p>
<p>He and Chirac joked that some of the other leaders, particularly Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, were so tired during the concert that they feel asleep.</p>
<p>"You were right yesterday night," Chirac told him. "All the others sat down and fell asleep, especially (Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro) Hashimoto, a very deep sleep."</p>
<p>"On TV they showed extracts," Yeltsin said. Then he put his head back as if falling asleep.</p>
<p>Yeltsin emerged from his limousine at the Denver Public Library for Sunday's closing summit session looking pale. He waved to the crowd across the street, then walked slowly and stiffly up red carpet to the entrance.</p>
<p>"I feel fine," he told a Russian journalist.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said there was no reason to believe Yeltsin would not participate in summit events the rest of the day.</p>
<p>"We heard that he was tired, probably a little jet-lagged, and decided to forgo the entertainment," the official said.</p>
<p>In the final summit communique, leaders were set to present a united front urging China to ensure Hong Kong's civil liberties and guarantee free elections after Beijing takes control of the British colony on July 1.</p>
<p>"The United States is making very clear that we are monitoring and watching that very carefully," Albright said.</p>
<p>Leaders also planned to express their determination to revive the stalled Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>"Restoring the sense of security and confidence among Israelis and Palestinians is essential," a draft of the communique said.</p>
<p>Before leaving this Rocky Mountain city, the leaders planned to release a statement urging Bosnia's former warring factions to step up the pace of the peace process.</p>
<p>The summit partners on Saturday papered over differences on plans to pull American peacekeepers out of Bosnia by mid-1998 and concentrated on telling the former warring parties that aid could be stopped if they let the peace process falter.</p>
<p>They singled out Croatia and Serbia for special criticism, faulting them for lack of commitment to the peace process.</p>
