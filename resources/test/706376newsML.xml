<headline>S&amp;P to review Australian debt over next few months.</headline>
<dateline>MELBOURNE 1997-07-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Standard and Poor's Corp said on Thursday that it would review Australia's credit rating in the near future.</p>
<p>An S&amp;P spokeswoman told Reuters that the New York-based rating agency's sovereign debt analyst, David Beers, would come to Australia in the next few weeks to begin the review.</p>
<p>"We will be conducting a sovereign review over the next few months," she said.</p>
<p>S&amp;P has an AA rating on Australia's foreign currency debt, with a positive outlook attached following the 1996/97 (July-June) national budget announced in August 1996.  </p>
<p>The agency affirmed the "AA" long term and "A1-plus" short term ratings in response to the 1997/98 budget handed down on May 13 this year.</p>
<p>It said at the time that the budget itself would not trigger an upgrade, citing some concern about a possible mid-year deterioration in the budget position as happened in 1996/97.</p>
<p>The rival agency, Moody's Investors Service, said on Wednesday that Australia's AA2 rating outlook had improved, citing tight fiscal and prudent monetary policies.  </p>
<p>A Moody's analyst told Reuters in New York earlier on Thursday that any change in the rating, however, may be up to 18 months away.</p>
