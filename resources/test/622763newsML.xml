<p>The New Jersey Turnpike Authority may sell as much as $700 million of bonds in the first quarter of 1998, including a possible $300 million refunding, the agency's executive director said Thursday.</p>
<p>Edward Gross said in a telephone interview that proceeding with the $400 million new money component hinges on an environmental permit now under consideration by state regulators.  </p>
<p>The catalyst for getting the new money deal underway will be approval from the state's Department of Environmental Protection for a $290 million project connecting the Turnpike to Route 1 in Middlesex County.</p>
<p>A hearing involving the project is set for June 10, Gross said.</p>
<p>Other bond-financed plans contributing to the $400 million need include moving the Turnpike's Interchange 1 toll plaza, and various bridge redecking and revitalization projects.</p>
<p>The size of the refunding component would depend on market conditions at the time of the sale. Gross said the $300 million estimate represents a "modest" refunding of a portion of the agency's $2.5 billion in outstanding debt. ((--Steven Dickson, 212-859-1652))</p>
