<headline>Danish shares rally, more modest gains seen ahead.</headline>

<p>Danish share prices closed higher on Friday, recovery modestly in a cautious market on top of the recent days of U.S.-inspired tumbles, with dealers seeing the possibility of more slow gains again on Monday.</p>
<p>"The afternoon's March U.S. non-farm payroll data should not cause share falls on Wall Street, so I think we will see modest rises here again on Monday following the British and German post-market climbs," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index gained 0.34 point to close at 149.02, while the KFX June future rose 0.20 point to 148.60 with 10 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>On a quiet day, the most traded paper was East Asiatic, with 82,000 shares changing hands to close 12 crowns up at 173 on London analyst forecasts of a possible 30-40 percent rise in the EAC's share value in the coming year.</p>
<p>Overall turnover for the day was 784 million crowns.</p>
