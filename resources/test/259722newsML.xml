<p>Egyptian business representatives will visit Kuwait on Tuesday to promote the export of food and agricultural products to the Gulf Arab state.</p>
<p>An Egyptian embassy official said the private sector team would seek to increase Egyptian food exports to Kuwait during the four-day visit.</p>
<p>"They will offer a wide range of products like vegetables, fruits, rice, sugar, dairy products in addition to canned foods, food preservatives and other goods," the official added.</p>
<p>Egyptian exports to Kuwait, which do not include military hardware, are worth about $70 million a year compared to Kuwaiti exports to Egypt of almost $20 million, diplomats said.</p>
