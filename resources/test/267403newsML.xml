<p>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, preparing for meetings with farmers, processors and consumers, said Thursday he still had a number of options on the demand side to bolster dairy prices.</p>
<p>Dairy prices ran at record prices during the summer but have slumped recently, leading to calls for the Agriculture Department to subsidize more dairy exports, buy more goods for public nutrition programs or artificially raise prices.</p>
<p>"I don't have anything to announce today," Glickman told reporters, adding there were "still a lot of options on the demand side."  </p>
<p>While Glickman devoted most of his comments to dairy exports and government purchases, he said he had an open mind on the issue of prices. Some dairy farmer groups want USDA to tinker with milk marketing orders to assure higher prices.</p>
<p>Milk marketing orders are regional mechanisms for setting the price of milk sold in grocery stores. Rather than being linked to the price of milk sold for making butter and cheese, some farmers want a minimum prices of about $13.50 per 100 lbs of milk, along with the "differential" for their region.</p>
<p>Consumer groups like Public Voice for Food and Health Policy said USDA intervention was not merited.</p>
<p>Despite recent declines, milk prices were at historically strong levels, Public Voice said.</p>
<p>"It's pretty irksome" to see demands for higher prices, a Public Voice economist said. Dairy farmers seemed to say "there isn't a problem when prices skyrocket, there's only a problem when prices fall," the economist said.</p>
<p>USDA chief economist Keith Collins noted that, by law, the dairy support price would drop by 15 cents per 100 lbs of milk on January 1 and the support program would end soon. With the trend toward deregulation, it would be "very difficult" for USDA to use marketing orders to boost prices, he said.</p>
