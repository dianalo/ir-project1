<p>Bre-X Minerals Ltd Chief Executive Officer David Walsh said on Monday he was confident investigators will "get to the bottom" of the scandal swirling around his company and its now worthless Busang gold deposit.</p>
<p>"Investigators will get to the bottom of this," Walsh told reporters before entering the company's headquarters in Calgary.</p>
<p>"Everything I am going to say today is in the news release (issued late Sunday)," Walsh said.</p>
<p>Bre-X released a damning independent audit of its Busang deposit on Sunday. The study, conducted by consultant Strathcona Mineral Services Ltd, concluded Bre-X's claim to have found the richest gold find of the century was falsified on a scale "without precedent in the history of mining."  </p>
<p>Bre-X has retained accounting firm Price Waterhouse, Forensic Investigative Associates and other advisers to determine how the data could have been falsified.</p>
<p>The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said on Monday that it received a copy of Strathcona's report on the Busang gold project and that investigators were reviewing it.</p>
<p>"Bre-X has given us a copy of the report and our investigators are reviewing that (report)," Deleen Schoff, a spokeswoman for the RCMP's K Division in Alberta, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Schoff said investigators with the RCMP's criminal crime unit were only reviewing the Strathcona report at this stage.</p>
<p>"I can't speculate on what they're going to do after they read the report," she said.</p>
