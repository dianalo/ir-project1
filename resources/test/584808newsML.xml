<headline>Indonesia rupiah down on liquidity, Thai spillover.</headline>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah softened against the dollar in early trading on Wednesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>One dealer in Singapore said uncertainty in the Thai baht seemed to spill over to the rupiah, supported by flush domestic liquidity and jitters over the election campaign.</p>
<p>One U.S. bank dealer said the rupiah fell in a hectic opening, pressured by an overnight fall in New York.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah settled at 2,432.50/33.25 at 0200 GMT after falling to a low of 2,433.5 from an opening of 2,430.0/31.5.</p>
<p>Tomorrow and today rupiah were at 2,432.25/33.00 and 2,431.50/32.25, respectively.  </p>
<p>One Japanese bank dealer said the rupiah was well offered in the morning, trading at around 10.0/10.5 percent. Overnight swaps were at 0.40/0.45 and tom/next at 0.47/0.50 points.</p>
<p>"The tone is slightly biddish on the rupiah," the U.S. bank dealer said, adding that people were nervous about the election campaign by the minority United Development Party in Jakarta on Wednesday, which has some potential for disturbances.</p>
<p>Dealers said if police did contain the situation, operators would switch to liquidity, which is anticipated to be tight on Friday due to weekly tax payments.  </p>
<p>The Singapore dealer said offshore players seemed to focus on the baht, but were watching the ongoing campaign closely.</p>
<p>The U.S. bank dealer said longer-term swaps were stable, aided by ample supply at the short end. He said short-covering in dollars was expected as the weekend neared.</p>
<p>One-month swaps were at 14.00/14.25, two at 26.00/27.00, three at 40.0/40.5 and six at 78.0/79.0 points.</p>
<p>The central bank raised its intervention band by one point to 2,407/2,599 and the conversion band also by one point to 2,407/2,455 on Tuesday after lowering them by one-point each in the past two trading days. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364</p>
