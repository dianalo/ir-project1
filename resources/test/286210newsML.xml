<p>Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan telephoned Syrian President Hafez Assad to express his country's condemnation of a bomb attack on a bus in central Damascus, the state news agency Petra reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Jordanians felt "outrage and repulsion over this criminal act that has targeted innocent lives," the Crown Prince was quoted as telling Assad late on Thursday.</p>
<p>Syria said Israeli agents planted a bomb on a bus in central Damascus on New Year's Eve, killing nine people and wounding 44, as part of attempts to destroy the Middle East peace process. Israel denied any involvement.</p>
<p>Petra said the Crown Prince told Assad that Jordan stood by and supported "sisterly" Syria and always opposed "terror and terrorists wherever they are found".</p>
<p>Assad in response was quoted by Petra as thanking the Crown Prince and "stressing that the terrorists who were behind this criminal act were targeting Syria's stances and its moves to attain just and permanent peace."</p>
<p>Relations between Jordan and Syria deteriorated after Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, but improved after King Hussein met Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in Damascus last August.</p>
<p>Syria, apparently responding to Jordanian complaints, began a crackdown on radical Palestinian and Moslem guerrillas hostile to Jordan. King Hussein gave Assad a security file on several alleged Syrian-aided attempts to attack Jordan in June. Syria denied any involvement in political violence against Jordan.</p>
