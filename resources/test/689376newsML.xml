<p>Pilots for AMR Corp's American Airlines on Thursday elected Dallas-based pilot Rich LaVoy to head the Allied Pilots Association, which launched a brief strike against the carrier in February.</p>
<p>LaVoy, who led the union in 1991-94, won 60 percent of the votes in a runoff race against Chicago-based Chuck Griffin.</p>
<p>About 70 percent of the union's 9,300 members voted in the run-off race.</p>
<p>Outgoing president Jim Sovich lost his re-election bid in a close first-round vote last month. LaVoy is to take over the post on July 1.</p>
<p>Sovich led the APA in a brief February strike that was stopped within half an hour when President Clinton ordered the pilots back to work and set up a presidential board to help broker a new labor contract.</p>
<p>The airline and union leaders finally reached agreement on a new five-year contract for the pilots in March and it was approved by rank-and-file members in May.</p>
