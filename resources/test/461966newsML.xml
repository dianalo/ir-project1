<p>The Czech economy is reaching a critical point, as the trade deficit continues to widen, economic growth slows and wages rise far quicker than industrial output, central bank Governor Josef Tosovsky told the weekend edition of Mlada Fronta Dnes.</p>
<p>"We (the central bank) see the situation as urgent," he told the paper in an interview.</p>
<p>The Czech economy has enjoyed seven years of demand-led growth as industry imported technology and the population, which has seen its wages rise sharply over the past few years, satisfied its thirst for consumer goods.</p>
<p>However, some cracks have begun to appear with industrial output failing to keep pace with wages, and in fact weakening recently, indicating investment has not been effective and that industry has not carried out vital restructuring.</p>
<p>Tosovksy said that wage growth has become one of the key problems for the economy, and that it cannot afford more than a 10 percent rise in wages in 1997.</p>
<p>Average industrial wages grew 14.4 percent in nominal terms in January while real industrial output contracted by 3.9 percent year-on-year, and construction output was 18.6 percent lower than a year earlier. The government has forecast wages to grow by 13 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Tosovsky said that he does not expect a re-introduction of wage controls, but instead he hopes the Tripartite Council -- comprised of officials from the government, unions and employers -- could develop a plan to curb wage growth.</p>
<p>He also said that while the economy was still growing, GDP growth in 1996 was 4.4 percent, year-on-year, there were negative trends jeopardising its dynamics.</p>
<p>"Those (trends) include the widening deficit of the current balance of payment, a tendency of the budget toward a deficit and the fact that wages are growing too fast," Tosovsky said.</p>
<p>"Our economy gets more capital in the form of credits than direct investment and the deficit of the current balance of payment stands at more than eight percent of the GDP," he added.</p>
<p>With the rate of import growth exceeding export growth, the trade deficit ballooned to a record 160.3 billion crowns for 1996, and has shown no signs of slowing in 1997.</p>
<p>The trade deficit was 13.6 billion crowns in January and a Reuter survey of economists earlier this week forecast a slight rise in February to 14.5 billion, nearly double that of the same month of 1996. February trade figures are scheduled to be released on Monday.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Tosovsky, as he has said many times before, rejected a devaluation of the crown as a solution to the problem. "We do not intend to give up our exchange rate policy of a strong crown as we consider it very important," he said.</p>
