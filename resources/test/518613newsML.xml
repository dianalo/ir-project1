<p>Tobacco monopoly Austria Tabak on Thursday posted record 1996 earnings and a massive swing into the black and said the result proved it was fit for privatisation and flotation.</p>
<p>The company turned in a group net profit of 1.3 billion schillings ($106.9 million) after a loss of 1.1 billion in 1995 and painted an upbeat picture for the year ahead.</p>
<p>"A conservative forecast for 1997 is that we will certainly match last year's excellent result and bring growing shareholder value," chairman Heinz Schiendl said during a news conference on the results.</p>
<p>Pretax profit jumped 27 percent to 1.8 billion and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) gained 17 percent to 1.6 billion.</p>
<p>The government placed Austria Tabak in the hands of state holding company OeIAG last August to prepare it for privatisation.</p>
<p>OeIAG chief Karl Hollweger said Austria Tabak could be privatised and floated on the Vienna stock exchange in November at the earliest.</p>
<p>"Austria Tabak is a very attractive flotation candidate and I'm confident we can take the first step this year," he told reporters at the news conference.</p>
<p>OeIAG's envisages selling off 75 percent of Austria Tabak in two tranches by the end of 1999, with OeIAG holding the remaining 25 percent.</p>
<p>The first tranche would likely be 25 percent, "but if market conditions are favourable, we could float the bigger tranche first," Hollweger said.</p>
<p>"I can't say what the proceeds will be from the flotation, but judging from Austria Tabak's earnings performance last year it will surely be a respectable sum."</p>
<p>Austria Tabak said its recovery was helped by the sale of lossmaking sports equipment maker Head-Tyrolia-Mares (HTM) in September, 1995.</p>
<p>Group sales rose three percent to 58.3 billion schillings, with sales in Austria receding but increasing abroad.</p>
<p>"We've got to be realistic and see that sales will continue to fall on the Austrian market, but we expect to increase sales in international markets," said Austria Tabak's Schiendl.</p>
<p>It will focus on developing new markets, with particular emphasis on Asia.</p>
<p>Austria tabak is already the largest wholesaler of cigarettes in Germany through its subsidiary Tobaccoland Deutschland.</p>
<p>At home, the company enjoys a commanding presence, with its own brands accounting for 60 percent of the market, while brands produced by Austria Tabak under license hold a further 35 percent. ($ = 12.16 Austrian Schillings)</p>
