<p>France rushed 800 extra troops to Brazzaville on Monday and evacuated hundreds of its nationals from the Congolese capital, providing the first foreign policy test for the new left-wing government.</p>
<p>A defence ministry spokeswoman said the reinforcements, half from mainland France and half from Chad, would take the number of French soldiers in Brazzaville to 1,200.</p>
<p>Amid reports of hostility towards French nationals, 460 French residents were flown to Libreville, in neighbouring Gabon, and 100 more were to be evacuated later in the day.</p>
<p>Paris announced it was sending 500 extra troops after a French soldier was killed and five others wounded in a clash with local irregulars while rescuing foreigners. It boosted the number of reinforcements after heavy fighting resumed between forces loyal to President Pascal Lissouba and ex-president Denis Sassou Nguesso's militia.</p>
<p>In Lisbon, a Portuguese government spokesman said French troops were protecting about 30 Portuguese residents of Brazzaville, but there were no immediate plans to evacuate them.</p>
<p>Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin took office only last week, and the fighting provided a first test of his government and "cohabitation" with conservative President Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>Analysts said Chirac and Jospin would be keen to present a united front in a crisis endangering French lives, but differences on African policy wwere likely to emerge later.</p>
<p>The crisis in the Republic of Congo, following the overthrow of ally Mobutu Sese Seko in neighbouring Zaire which has since been renamed Democratic Republic of Congo, raised fears that other French-speaking African states could be destabilised.</p>
<p>Oil-rich neighbours Congo and Gabon, bordering the Central African Republic, a key staging post for French troops in Africa, form a key region for Paris' strategic interests on the continent.</p>
<p>International affairs analyst Dominique Moisi said hostility towards French nationals in Brazzaville reflected a crisis in France's relations with its former colonies.</p>
<p>"In the longer term, France's whole African policy will have to be reviewed. But not during a crisis," said Moisi, deputy head of the French Institute for International Relations (IFRI).</p>
<p>Socialist Defence Minister Alain Richard, facing his first crisis since he was appointed last week, had one hour of talks with Chirac on Monday morning.</p>
<p>"We are working," he merely told reporters as he left the Elysee presidential palace.</p>
<p>Jospin said on Sunday that the government "along with the president, will do all we can to assure the safety of our nationals in Brazzaville".</p>
<p>Representatives of Chirac, Jospin, the defence and foreign ministries set up a joint crisis unit and officials said all agreed on the immediate steps to be taken.</p>
<p>Rummelhardt said France was backing a mediation attempt by Brazzaville Mayor Bernard Kolelas, runner-up to Lissouba in the 1992 presidential election, to bring about a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Moisi said that African policy was traditionally the French president's privilege in his delicate sharing of power with the prime minister. Jospin, although critical of Chirac's African policy, was unlikely to use the crisis to rock the boat.</p>
<p>"Jospin will keep a low profile...The main thing is to show the outside world a united front," he said.</p>
<p>During his election campaign, Jospin denounced the fall of Mobutu to president Laurent Kabila's Rwanda-backed rebels as marking "the failure of France's African policy".</p>
<p>Some African experts have evoked a "domino theory", forecasting that the upheaval in Zaire would spill over into its neighbours and destabilise the former French colonies.</p>
<p>"Paris will rapidly need to define a policy in line with what is at stake in Congo. Unlike Zaire, where France had few economic interests, Congo is at the heart of our presence in Africa," commentator Pierre Rousselin said in the conservative daily Le Figaro.</p>
