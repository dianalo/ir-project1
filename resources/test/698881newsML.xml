<p>Singapore naphtha prices edged up slightly on Tuesday with crude while gasoline held steady as Indonesian buying quietened down, traders said.</p>
<p>"It is not picking up," said one trader on Indonesian demand.</p>
<p>The market has been pinning their hopes on refinery shutdowns in July and August to prompt some regional demand in an otherwise lacklustre market.</p>
<p>Traders said two 120,000-barrel cargoes lifting in July have been sold to Indonesia at a slight premium over Singapore quotes on a fob basis.  </p>
<p>But they still assessed the market to be more in a discount of at least as low as 50 cents per barrel amid poor demand.</p>
<p>Taiwan's state-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp (CPC) will issue its regular reformate buy tender on Wednesday, a company official said.</p>
<p>The tender which seeks 250,000 barrels of 95-octane unleaded reformate delivered to Keelung, Kaohsiung, Shalung or Taichung, August 16-31, closes July 9 and is valid for two days.</p>
<p>In the Singapore fob market, traders said a Japanese trader was both offering and bidding for July lifting 92-octane unleaded gasoline at $21.50/$22.50 per barrel.  </p>
<p>The August gasoline swap was bid at $23.05 but faced no offers.</p>
<p>Naphtha swaps firmed by 10 cens per barrel, but bids and offers were far apart at $20.45/$20.65 per barrel, trades said.</p>
