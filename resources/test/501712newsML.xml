<p>In the heart of Manila's fashionable Makati business district, the sight of a Mercedes or Volvo gliding along in the unending stream of traffic is still rare, unlike some of Asia's other big cities.</p>
<p>That could soon change.</p>
<p>Flush with more disposable cash from a growing economy and armed with a readier clutch of credit, Philippines consumers have gone on a buying spree for cars, clothes and condominiums.</p>
<p>They have not been disappointed. The new affluence has generated vast shopping malls, lured luxury car distributors such as Jaguar and Porsche, and dotted Manila's downtown landscape with numerous construction projects.</p>
<p>To some observers, the spending mania and the willingness to take on debt to finance it may be reaching a dangerous point.</p>
<p>The country's Central Bank, which last year investigated the extent of banks' loan exposure to the speculative property sector, said in March that it was checking on credit card and automobile loans.</p>
<p>By booming Asia's standards, the nouveau riche in this country of 68 million are still very nouveau, with per capital incomes at just over $1,000 a year versus about $24,000 for Singapore.</p>
<p>Economic growth this year is expected to tick up to 6.0 percent from 5.5 percent in 1996 and 4.8 percent in 1995. Much of that growth has been from personal spending.</p>
<p>Banks, in the meantime, have enjoyed annual loan growth rates of over 35 percent for the past four years.</p>
<p>CREDIT GROWING WITH ECONOMY</p>
<p>The surge in credit is a natural consequence of economic growth, analysts said.</p>
<p>A recent banking report by stockbrokers W.I. Carr noted that the Philippines' domestic credit as a percentage of gross domestic product is still the lowest in Asia. In March 1996, that figure stood at under 60 percent.</p>
<p>The relatively untapped market for consumer loans prompted Citicorp's Citibank last October to offer an uncollaterised personal credit line of up to 250,000 pesos ($9,505.70).</p>
<p>Citibank is the Philippines' biggest credit card issuer, accounting for about a third of the market.</p>
<p>There is more ground to be gained, said Alfonso Salcedo, Citibank's country marketing director. "It's not a mature market," he said in an interview, noting that there are about 1.6 million credit cards in circulation against a labour force size of 28 million.</p>
<p>BANKS DISPLACING PAWNSHOPS</p>
<p>Consumers are being weaned from more traditional borrowing sources such as pawnshops and credit unions. And, even with interest charges of 35 percent and above, there are many takers, bankers said.</p>
<p>The consumer loan market is dominated by Bank of the Philippine Island (BPI), which is estimated to have 60 percent of the country's consumer banking operations.</p>
<p>BPI has estimated its customer loans growth will be 30 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>But the good times won't keep on rolling, analysts warn.</p>
<p>W.I. Carr said it expects an "inevitable slowdown" in loans growth as well as "a fall off" in loans quality.</p>
<p>BAD DEBT SEEN RISING BUT CENTRAL BANK NOT ALARMED</p>
<p>Bad debt is already cropping up, with some banks facing default rates of more than 12 percent in auto loans, it said.</p>
<p>"The direction, basically, is that bad debt is going to go up," said Christopher Hunt, W.I.Carr's director of research.</p>
<p>While the Central Bank's survey of bank exposure to real estate loans last year said the proportion was about 10 percent of total loan portfolios, bankers say the actual exposure is probably twice as much.</p>
<p>The real extent of loans to the sector may have been disguised as some are classified under other headings, they said.</p>
<p>The findings on auto loans could be nasty, analysts said. "Some banks have experienced a high level of repossessed cars," said Marjo Elevado, senior research associate with the Bankers Association of the Philippines.</p>
<p>Amando Tetangco, Central Bank managing director for research, told local television that the latest survey on credit card and auto debt had so far not raised any red flags on the number of defaults.</p>
<p>"We do not think that the level of consumer lending has reached alarming levels," he said. Results of the survey should be out in the next few months.</p>
<p>CORPORATE MARGINS THINNING</p>
<p>One reason for the consumer lending binge is because of higher returns compared with the thin margins on corporate business, analysts said.</p>
<p>Stronger competition and low interest rates have thinned the spreads between the cost of funds and loans. "With the narrowing spreads from traditional banking activities, banks will have to tap their vast reservoir of creative talents...," Joey Bermudez, PCI Bank branch banking segment head, told members of the Philippine Futuristics Society.</p>
<p>"...the consumer market will see the continued rise of the 'yuppies', a younger but more economically powerful segment," Bermudez added. ($1=26.3 pesos)</p>
