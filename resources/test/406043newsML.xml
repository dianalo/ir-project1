<p>French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette slammed the European Parliament on Wednesday for criticising a French bill to combat illegal immigration, saying it showed the parliament was "not worthy of the name".</p>
<p>"It's very shocking that the parliament lets itself become involved in things that don't concern it, by that I mean French legislation," de Charette told France 2 television.</p>
<p>"Once again, I have to say it with regret, because I am very convinced by our European project, I have to note that the European Parliament shows that it is not yet a parliament worthy of the name," he said.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac also told the European parliament on Tuesday to mind its own business after it adopted a resolution last week urging withdrawal of the bill, currently under debate in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>The parliament resolution, adopted by 106-101 votes, was organised by leftist French members. Chirac called it "unacceptable". The bill would close loopholes in existing immigration laws that left some immigrants in a legal limbo -- if they have children born in France they can neither be deported nor obtain legal status.</p>
<p>It would also impose restrictions on non-European visitors to France, allowing fingerprinting and tightening reporting of departures.</p>
<p>France's most serious clash with the parliament, which is hoping that European Union member governents will grant it new powers under a review of EU institutions, came when Chirac reported his decision to stage nuclear tests in 1995-96.</p>
<p>Leftist and ecologist parliamentarians heckled and jeered Chirac's speech in Strasbourg in July 1995, chanting "No No No" and waving banners bearing a mushroom cloud and the word "Non" in French.</p>
<p>De Charette said the centre-right government's immigration bill was "fair and just" and rejected suggestions it might damage France's image abroad.</p>
<p>"We have a place in the world. There is more confidence in France abroad than there is at home," he said.</p>
<p>Opposition Socialist floor leader Laurent Fabius criticised the bill in parliament on Tuesday as "ineffectual, dangerous and Kafkaesque". He said it would turn all foreigners, and their French hosts, into suspects.</p>
<p>Riot police and protesters clashed in Paris on Tuesday night after rallies against the measures.</p>
