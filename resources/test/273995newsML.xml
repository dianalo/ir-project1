<p>Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok welcomes a call by Belgian premier Jean-Luc Dehaene for a drugs "mini-summit", but is not yet ready to commit the Netherlands to such a meeting, a spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>Dehaene on Sunday told Dutch radio that he would favour a summit bringing together France, Germany and the Benelux countries to further combat the drug threat.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Kok's office said the Dutch Prime Minister had taken into consideration Dehaene's view and welcomed his pragmatic approach to the drugs problem.</p>
<p>"Mr Kok is not ruling out a "mini-summit" but he has the view that the ministers for police, justice and public health are more closely concerned with the problem and it might be better if they met first," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>"It's an idea that we want to carry further but he (Kok) thinks it's more in the department of the ministers of police, justice and public health," he added.</p>
<p>Dehaene, in an interview taped last week before his weekend visit to the Balkans, said this month's agreement at the European Union's Dublin summit to fight organised crime and drugs was a big step forward but the five countries could do more to expand cross-border cooperation.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that France was maintaining controls on some of its borders because of its concerns about drugs moving from the Netherlands, which has a policy of toleration of "soft" drugs such as marijuana.</p>
<p>The Dutch and the French have clashed over France's demands that the Netherlands clamp down on its liberal drugs policy which allows the sale of small amounts of marijuana in controlled "coffee shops."</p>
<p>Last March, French President Jacques Chirac cancelled a scheduled drugs "mini-summit" because of the conflict with The Hague.</p>
