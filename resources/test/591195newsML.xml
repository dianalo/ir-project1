<p>Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan will meet Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller on Friday, hours after opposition parties submitted a censure motion against their coalition government, Ciller's office said.</p>
<p>Ciller's office said the pair would meet at 4.30 p.m. (1330 GMT) at the prime minister's office. It did not say what they would be discussing.</p>
<p>Four of the five opposition parties in parliament submitted a joint censure motion on Friday against Erbakan and his cabinet in a bid to topple the Islamist-conservative alliance.</p>
<p>The motion accuses Erbakan and his ministers of dividing the officially secular country along Moslem-secularist lines.</p>
<p>Opposition and dissident government MPs have been negotiating for some time to try to bring down the government, which has been attacked by Turkey's traditional elite, particularly the powerful military, for putting the country's secularist make-up in danger.</p>
