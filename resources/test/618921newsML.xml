<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin, in a surprise announcement at a NATO-Russia summit, said on Tuesday that Moscow would disarm all missiles targeted at NATO countries.</p>
<p>"I have taken a decision today. Everything that is aimed at countries present here, all of those weapons, are going to have their warheads removed," Yeltsin said.  </p>
<p>Yeltsin stood up and made the statement in an impromptu intervention in the summit after signing the "Founding Act" of a new partnership for security in Europe with leaders of the 16-nation Atlantic alliance.</p>
<p>The apparent decision to disarm the former Soviet nuclear arsenal targeted at the West came as a surprise and was greeted with warm applause.</p>
<p>The United States and Russia agreed at a summit in Moscow in 1993 no longer to target each other's cities, but Yeltsin's announcement appeared to go far beyond that commitment.</p>
