<p>India's first private oil refiner will be forced to stop production if the government does not pay its dues under a state-administered pricing formula, a senior company official said on Friday.</p>
<p>Mangalore Refineries and Petrochemicals Ltd (MRPL) had told the government it would be forced to stop production if more than four billion rupees ($111 million) was not paid from the oil pool account, analysts said.</p>
<p>"What you have heard is true, but we don't want to talk about it in the media," the official with the private Aditya Birla Group, which owns 26 percent of MRPL, told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>The state-run Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) owns 26 percent of MRPL and the rest is held by financial institutions and the public.</p>
<p>The oil pool account assures a uniform 12 percent return on net worth to refiners. Analysts said it was running at a deficit of more than 50 billion rupees.</p>
<p>"It's a Catch 22 situation," said an executive of a state-run refining firm. "MRPL is not able to gets its money from the pool. So they are not paying for crude either."</p>
<p>Oil analysts said MRPL paid for its crude for the first few months after it commissioned its southwestern Mangalore refinery in March.</p>
<p>"For the last two months, they have stopped paying for the crude," said an oil analyst at a brokerage tracking the firm.</p>
<p>MRPL's petroleum products are sold by HPCL which has a countrywide retail network.</p>
<p>Analysts said two state-run refineries, Madras Refineries and Cochin Refineries, which do not have their own retail network, were suffering badly.</p>
<p>An official at Indian Oil Corporation said his company was also owed money by the government. "But we are better off because our sales generate cash flows," he said.</p>
<p>R. Venkatraman, manager of research at ICICI Securities, said the upward revision of petroleum product prices in July was partly aimed at cutting down the oil pool deficit.</p>
<p>"The situation can't go on," he said. The government had to act before new large private refineries came on stream around 2000, he said.</p>
<p>"Otherwise the oil pool account will go into a spin."</p>
<p>Analysts said that the government was considering ways to deregulate the oil industry before the new refineries came on stream.</p>
<p>New refineries being planned by Reliance Petroleum Ltd to process 15 million tonnes of crude a year and Essar Oil Ltd to process 9.0 million tonnes a year.</p>
