<p>Unicom Corp, parent company of Commonwealth Edison Co, said Thursday it had formed three ventures to expand its geographic base and provide additional energy sources.</p>
<p>"Each of these ventures extends Unicom's market beyond its traditional territory," James O'Connor, Unicom chairman, said in remarks prepared for the annual meeting. "While we intend to maintain our leadership position within our existing services area, our goal is to build a naitonal organization equipped to meet broad energy needs of an expanded customer base."  </p>
<p>Unicom said it had formed Unicom Energy Services Inc to offer advisory services to increase energy efficiency for commercial and industrial customers in the Midwest.</p>
<p>It said it was exploring a trade alliance with a major natural gas supplier that would allow Unicom to sell natural gas in unregulated markets to large industrial and commercial users. Unicom said it will expand its product line to include gas and distributed on-premise energy.  </p>
<p>In the third venture, Unicom said it had joined with Nevada Power Co to supply thermal and other energy-related services to buildings in Las Vegas, an arrangement similar to its partnerships in Boston, Houston and Windsor, Ontario.</p>
<p>O'Connor praised proposed legislation before the Illinois legislature that outlines plans to deregulate the electric utility industry in the state.</p>
<p>The legislation will provide Unicom an "opportunity to succeed, an opportunity which we would more than welcome," he told the annual meeting, held in Rockford, Ill.</p>
<p>O'Connor said Unicom remains in a strong financial position. "Earnings and cash flows have been strong, well above the dividend level for the last two years," he said.</p>
