<title>USA: US crudes rally on short covering, lack of avails.</title>
<headline>US crudes rally on short covering, lack of avails.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>A lack of available North Sea crudes and short covering ahead of the end to May business boosted U.S. cash crudes all session Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>The twin reasons aided domestic sweet barrels the most, allowing Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James to erase a 20 cents discount to benchmark West Texas Intermediate/Cushing.</p>
<p>Barrels were sold all session at ever-stronger differentials, reflecting refiners' covering ahead of May pipeline scheduling Friday, and NYMEX May expiry Tuesday.</p>
<p>"There were a lot of refiners covering in there who thought the market was heading south (weaker)," said a trader.  </p>
<p>North Sea crudes for the U.S. Gulf were all but mopped-up for the immediate term, also playing into the gains made for sweet barrels, traders said.</p>
<p>"Shell sold all of their cargoes so there looks to be nothing on avails right now (for Brent)," said a trader.</p>
<p>May WTI/Cushing talked late at $20.30-40 a barrel, around 45 cts firmer than late on Friday.</p>
<p>Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James talked late at flat to 3 cts over WTI/Cushing benchmark, after trading earlier in the session from weak marks at 18 cts under WTI.</p>
<p>Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire sold at 55 and 60 cts below the marker, with Midland/WTI slightly firmer at 27-28 cts cheaper than WTI/Cushing.</p>
<p>West Texas Sour/Midland moved as strong as WTI/Cushing -$1.66, after starting the session at $1.75-1.80 below. Sour traders pegged WTS at $1.65 for value later in the day.</p>
<p>Eugene Island barely raised an eyebrow today, talking around a $1.65-70 discount to WTI/Cushing.</p>
<p>May Postings Plus increased in value all session, climbing higher to $2.12 in conjunction with May WTI building a healthy 27-30 cts premium to June WTI.</p>
<p>Outright prices were also supported by political tensions in the Middle East, based mainly on a series of events surrounding Iran and Iraq, and the United States.</p>
<p>Baghdad said earlier Monday it would send helicopters through a U.S.-patrolled "no-fly zone" to pick-up Iraqi pilgrims, returning from Moslem haj along the Saudi border.</p>
<p>Marketwatchers said the impact of violating the "no-fly zone" could hit Iraq's attempt to rollover the oil-for-food deal next month, when the accord comes up for U.N. review.</p>
<p>Washington indicated there would be no military action against civilian-laden helicopters, but that an "appropriate" response would be sought if flights occurred.</p>
<p>Market analysts doubted a vigorous response from the U.N., noting that Washington was rebuked in trying to harshly condemn the original flights that brought Iraqis to Mecca in the first place.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, despite U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen saying there was no indisputable link between Iran and the 1996 deadly bombing of an American military barracks in Saudi, reports continued to surface tying Tehran to the attack.</p>
<p>Iranian students also extended their protests at the German embassy in Tehran, expressing anger over the Berlin court decision declaring Iranian involvement in political killings on German soil.</p>
<p>Also on the bullish side were calls on Monday by OPEC president, the Libyan Oil Minister Abdalla el-Badri for production restraint by members in order to boost prices.</p>
<p>U.S. sweet domestic barrels found support from reports in Nigeria of increased tribal battles in Warri, where eight people died in Monday in the key oil city.</p>
<p>Royal Dutch Shell Group, said the crisis had forced it to shut one flow station and that output was running 2,000 barrels per day below normal.</p>
