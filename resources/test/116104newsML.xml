<headline>IPO SPOTLIGHT-XLConnect price hiked, demand high.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-10-15</dateline>

<p>XLConnect Solutions Inc has raised the estimated price tag on its shares as investors clamor to get in on the initial public offering of the provider of network products for complex computer and communications systems.</p>
<p>XLConnect raised the estimated range to $13-$14 a share from its previous estimate of $10 to $12, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Analysts expect the deal to sizzle.  </p>
<p>"It was 20 times over subscribed as of Friday," said Vince Slavin, who tracks IPOs for Cantor Fitzgerald.  He gave the stock a rare "A++" rating and said considering the feverish demand, he was surprised at how long the company and underwriters waited to raise the range.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to price either tonight or tomorrow night, according to underwriter Alex Brown &amp; Sons Inc. The company plans to offer 2.9 million shares which would trade on the Nasdaq under the symbol "XLCT."  </p>
<p>The IPO Financial Network, based in Springfield, New Jersey, said it had expected the deal to rise two to three points at its market debut before the price increase.</p>
<p>XL Connect is a unit of microcomputer company Intelligent Electronics Inc ; both are based in Exton, Pa.</p>
<p>After the offering, Intelligent Electronics would own about 82.1 percent of XL and it has said it has no immediate plans to cash out and sell the shares.</p>
<p>Cantor said one factor heating up demand was the raging success of the IPO of International Network Services, which also provides networking products. Its stock soared 84 percent at its September 18 IPO to 29-1/2 and has climbed even higher, trading at 38-1/4 on Tuesday.</p>
