<p>Building products, sugar and aluminium group CSR Ltd said on Monday that it expected cost savings of A$30-35 million per year from its planned improvement programme in the timber products division.</p>
<p>"The figures we believe we'll get in the first year is about A$35 million," CSR managing director Geoff Kells told reporters.</p>
<p>"We then have a second year to get another A$30 to A$35 million," he said.</p>
<p>CSR announced earlier on Monday it planned to keep its timber products business which had previously been put up for sale through an international tender  </p>
<p>Kells said the offers received had not justified the sale of timber assets in the light of cost savings to be had from the improvement programme.</p>
<p>"In the end we did not get a bid for the whole of the business and we got a series of bids for parts of the business. None of those represented value to our shareholders compared to us achieving the improvements," he said.</p>
<p>While the focus was now on cost rationalisation, CSR was not ruling out changes in the future.  </p>
<p>"There are a range of restructuring options in the industry that we wish to pursue," said Kells, adding that CSR had already spoken to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission about relevant isues.</p>
<p>"There is not a plan or a single way of doing that, but rather if you look at our business in geographic locations there are obviously ways we can take further costs out of the business," Kell said.</p>
<p>The impact on profit from the cost savings was expected to be direct, providing the revenue side of the equation held up.  </p>
<p>"The only thing that will stop them going to the bottom line is a deterioration in prices," Kells said.</p>
<p>CSR shares closed Monday 10 cents lower at A$4.70 on turnover of 2.65 million shares.</p>
