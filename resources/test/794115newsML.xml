<p>U.S. debt futures reversed course from their early rise near midday and accelerated their retreat late to end lower.</p>
<p>Traders cited nervousness before key U.S. retail sales and inflation data Wednesday and Thursday, and after recent technical weakness. Strong Redbook sales fueled the downturn.</p>
<p>"The market still has bearish implications left over from Friday's decline," said Don Pullen, bond trading floor manager of ED and F Man. "The market is nervous -- a lot of people have been raising their estimates for retail sales over the last five days or so."  </p>
<p>A Reuter poll of economists showed an average forecast for July retail sales up 0.7 percent and up 0.5 percent excluding autos. In the previous report, sales grew 0.5 percent overall and 0.3 percent ex-autos.</p>
<p>Redbook's retail sales index late Tuesday showed U.S. adjusted retail sales up 0.9 percent in the August 9 week.</p>
<p>"The combination of inflation data and retail sales (worries) and the profit-taking show the market is still wounded from last week's huge sell-off," Pullen said.</p>
<p>Traders said September T-bond's inability to decisively move above resistance rekindled technical worries.  </p>
<p>Consumer price data will be released on Thursday. Reuters poll showed an average forecast of up 0.2 percent both overall and ex-food and energy.</p>
<p>Trading was light most of the day, but had turned extremely heavy late.</p>
<p>At the close, September T-bonds were down 9/32 at 112-15/32, December Eurodollars were 0.005 lower at 93.995 and 10-year T-notes were down 04/32 at 108-23/32. ((DerivativesDesk(312)408-8750))</p>
