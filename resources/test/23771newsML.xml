<headline>U.S. debt futures end lower, shaken by Chicago NAPM.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-08-30</dateline>

<p>U.S. debt futures finished a shortened pre-holiday session sharply lower, as the markets were shaken by a stronger than expected rise in the August National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index for the Chicago area, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>The August Chicago NAPM rose 8.8 points to 60.0, its highest level since 62.6 in February 1995 and the largest monthly rise since December 1993.</p>
<p>Primary dealers immediately sold Eurodollar and bond futures, after the market on average was expecting the index to rise marginally to 51.9 from July's 51.2.  </p>
<p>Traders also said Japanese investors were unwinding long Eurodollar futures/short swaps, and that heavy put buying helped pressure Eurodollars to lower levels before the close.</p>
<p>One U.S. firm bought 35,000 September 97 mid-curve put options at a strike price of 93.25 to 93.30 in the last two sessions, while a French firm bought 4,000 September 93.30 to 93.32 put spreads.</p>
<p>"Even before the data came out, we were seeing put buying," one floor trader said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, funds were reportedly good sellers of five-year notes.  </p>
<p>Rumors circulated that the Federal Reserve was buying five-year notes, and that a renowned hedge fund manager was buying 10-year notes in the cash markets.</p>
<p>However, December T-bonds ended below a major trendline level at 106-26/32, as the yield in the cash bond market set its highest monthly close since April 1995 at 7.12 percent, one analyst said.</p>
<p>December bonds blew through the July 30 low of 107-06/32, even though conditions were slightly oversold, traders said.</p>
<p>The December calendar spread continued to widen, also reflecting the market's fear of rising inflation.  </p>
<p>While the market continues to price-in higher U.S. interest rates, there was little conviction to the theory that the Federal Reserve would tighten rates before the next Federal Open Market Committee meeting on September 24.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve governor Lawrence Lindsey, speaking on U.S. cable television network CNBC, said the U.S. economy appears on balance to be a bit strong, adding the central bank would not curb growth provided inflation remains in check.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Fed chairman Alan Greenspan said at the annual Jackson Hole symposium that the goal of price stability is within reach for major nations.  </p>
<p>Traders said the Fed's decision to adopt a tightening bias at the July FOMC meeting has cast more focus on every piece of U.S. economic news.</p>
<p>"The Fed's stance has really sensitized us to all this data," one analyst said. "The revisions to GDP, for example, may not have attracted a lot of attention."</p>
<p>At the end of pit trade, December bonds were off 27/32 at 106-25/32, 10-year notes down 21/32 at 105-17/32, munibonds off 17/32 at 111-20/32, December Eurodollars were down 11 bps at 93.94, March Eurodollars were off 13 bps at 93.72 and March T-bills were down 12 bps at 94.33.</p>
