<p>NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of Britain's NatWest Bank, confirmed on Thursday it had lost a senior member of its loan syndication division to Dutch financial giant ABN AMRO Holding NV.</p>
<p>A NatWest Markets spokeswoman told Reuters that Gary Griffiths, a director of syndications, had resigned from the firm on Wednesday. Banking sources said he had been hired as head of loan syndication at ABN AMRO in London.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO was not immediately available for comment on the appointment.</p>
<p>Griffiths' departure was widely discussed in the loan market on Thursday because of his long-standing with NatWest, where they said he had been for 25 years. Griffiths reported to Grant Johnson, head of loan syndication at NatWest Markets.</p>
<p>Most recently he focused on syndicating debt facilities backing project financing, market sources said.</p>
<p>The bank has been the subject of intense speculation following the resignation on Monday of NatWest Markets' chief executive Martin Owen and the announcement of a major strategy overhaul.</p>
<p>NatWest Group chief executive Derek Wanless, who is also acting head of the investment bank until Owen's replacement is found, said on Monday the firm would reassess its lending.</p>
<p>But NatWest Markets would not withdraw from the loan market altogether, although it would review some "low-yielding, big ticket lending".</p>
<p>"There is still a role for that if it is part of an overall relationship with a client which is profitable, but in isolation its a very low-yielding business," he told Reuters.</p>

<p>left the firm to join ABN AMRO, banking sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gary Griffiths, a director of loan syndications, has resigned after 25 years with NatWest to take up a new role as head of loan syndications at ABN-AMRO in London, they added.</p>
