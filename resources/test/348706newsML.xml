<p>Stocks closed higher on Friday with broad-based buying as fears ease over the Hanbo Group's financial crisis and ample liquidity, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said the conglomerate's crisis remained as a source of caution but was not adding fresh impact on trading.</p>
<p>The composite index closed at 685.84, up 9.32 points or 1.38 percent. Advancing stocks beat decliners by 592 to 196.</p>
<p>"Liquidity remained high despite the Hanbo scandal due to releases of emergency funds since last week and this boosted buying," said Yoo Nam-gil of Hyundai Securities.  </p>
<p>Hanbo Steel, the conglomerate's flagship, is seeking court receivership after piling up almost five trillion won in loans.</p>
<p>The government supplied more than three trillion won into the money market since last week to ease a financial squeeze caused by Hanbo's failure.</p>
<p>Brokers said companies with healthy financial position or those rich with assets were under focus as investors avoided debt-ridden companies due to the Hanbo scandal.</p>
<p>"After the Hanbo crisis, financial position has become the most important consideration for investors," said a Dongwon Securities broker.  </p>
<p>Kisan Co rose 800 won to its daily limit of 11,000 on rumours that the company had agreed with a German firm to introduce technology for manufacturing of waste-treatment machinery. A Kisan spokesman refused to comment.</p>
<p>LG Metals Corp went limit-up to 14,900 won by gaining 1,100 won on news that it was negotiating to take a 51-percent stake in a gold mining project in Mali.</p>
<p>The news that the nation's trade deficit for the first 29 days of January was estimated at a record $4.1 billion had little immediate impact on the market, brokers said.  </p>
<p>"Trade deficit news had little impact as investors saw impact from the export slump had been reflected on the stock prices," said the Dongwon broker.</p>
<p>Futures March contracts rose 0.15 points to 69.90 while the underlying KOSPI-200 index added 0.81 points to 71.62.</p>
