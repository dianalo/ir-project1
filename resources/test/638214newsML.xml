<title>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Irish Bell Lines rescue package collapses.</title>

<p>A proposed rescue package for Irish freight transport group Bell Lines has collapsed after a consortium of investors withdrew their support for the plan, Irish newspapers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A High Court hearing to consider a rescue plan was abandoned on Tuesday after the investors pulled out and has been rescheduled for June 11. Unless a new rescue package can be put together by then, the company is likely to be liquidated.</p>
<p>The consortium of Irish Continental Group Plc, NatWest Venture Capital and Citycorp Venture Capital, which together own 85 percent of Bell Lines, said it was concerned about the extent of opposition to the rescue plan and the cost of rectifying operational difficulties in Ireland's Waterford Port.</p>
<p>Worries about expenses arising from Bell Lines' pension scheme, severance payments for executives and a possible delay in getting regulatory approval for the deal also contributed to the consortium's decision to withdraw its support for the rescue package, it said.</p>
<p>The plan would have involved the injection of three to five million Irish pounds in new equity into Bell Lines in return for cost reductions.</p>
<p>Bell Lines has trading debts of more than 20 million Irish pounds after running into difficulties in 1995 and 1996.</p>
