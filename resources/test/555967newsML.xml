<p>Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten expressed shock on Friday at the Labour Party's landslide win in Britain's general election, but warned punters not to bet on him as the next leader of the ousted Conservatives.</p>
<p>Patten is a former Conservative Party chairman credited with engineering the Tories' unexpected win at the polls in 1992.</p>
<p>"As a Conservative, although not an active Conservative at the moment, the result comes as something of a shock," Patten told a Hong Kong television station.</p>
<p>Patten, whose career as Hong Kong's 28th and last governor ends when the British colony reverts to China at midnight on June 30, has been tipped as a possible successor to John Major.</p>
<p>Major said on Friday he would step down as party leader after handing in his resignation as prime minister in the wake of Labour's decisive win under Tony Blair.</p>
<p>But Patten played down his ambitions, saying he needed a seat in the House of Commons before he could run for the top post.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't advise anybody to put any money on me. One of the things which I lack in the party leadership stake is a seat in the Commons. I wouldn't take that seriously," he said.</p>
<p>Patten said he hoped Britain would do well under the new Labour government.</p>
<p>"I congratulate Mr Blair and the Labour Party, and as a patriot I hope that Britain does well in the future," he said.</p>
<p>Patten, appointed governor after losing his seat in parliament in 1992, has said many times he may take a break when his stint in Hong Kong ends and finish writing a book.</p>
