<p>The South Korean won finished Tuesday's trading lower than the previous day, but higher than the opening level, dealers said.</p>
<p>The won fell sharply at opening on the Japanese yen's drop against the U.S. dollar on world markets, but stop-loss dollar selling pushed up the won later in the day, they said.</p>
<p>It ended at 894.00, against Monday's close of 893.10. It opened at 896.00 and moved between 892.70 and 897.50.</p>
<p>Dealers said traders would not remain long with dollars when the dollar was unlikely to sharply rise in the near future.  </p>
<p>But dealers said the basic sentiment remained strong towards the dollar due to the country's huge current account deficit and the Japanese yen's weakness against the U.S. unit.</p>
<p>"Today's trend was in contrast to underlying factors," said a domestic bank dealer. "But there's a possibility for the dollar to sharply rebound if the dollar falls further."</p>
<p>Dealers expected the won's base mid-rate for Wednesday to be pegged at 894.20, compared with 895.00 won for Tuesday.</p>
