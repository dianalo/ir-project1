<p>Chinese agricultural specialists have warned that further falls in domestic rice prices this winter could discourage farmers from planting rice and create supply problems next year, the Beijing Economic Daily said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The current price in north China markets has slumped to 2.6 to 2.8 yuan ($0.31- $0.34) kg from around four yuan ($0.48) per kg price one year ago.</p>
<p>It said two successive bumper grain harvests and reduced exports had swollen stockpiles and led to the fall in prices.</p>
<p>Specialists warned that rising production costs were likely to add to farmer worries. They called on the government to buy grain from farmers at reasonable prices, it said.</p>
<p>State purchases of early rice reached 9.08 million tonnes by the end of August, above the target of 7.96 million tonnes set by the state, the report said.</p>
