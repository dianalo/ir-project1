<p>Mistrust between Belgium's French-speaking and Flemish communities deepened over the weekend amid accusations in the wake of a child abuse and kidnapping case that has left the country in a state of shock.</p>
<p>The affair, which has made headlines since mid-August, has highlighted the lack of a strong common identity in Belgium which became a state just over 150 years ago.</p>
<p>Revelations about a gang who snatched, molested and killed young girls were followed by those about the separate, Mafia-style killing of former minister Andre Cools in July 1991, and about suspected corruption in the both cases.</p>
<p>Both occurred in francophone Wallonia -- a coincidence which some politicians in the northern Dutch-speaking half have used to call for further separation between Wallonia and Flanders, which received far-reaching powers in a reform in 1993.</p>
<p>The affairs have changed the image of Belgium from a quiet backwater where food and beer are good to a seemingly lawless state where mafia corruption infects politics and paedophiles enjoy police protection and lavish social security benefits.</p>
<p>The image of Wallonia, where industry is in decline, has become even worse: an army of marginalised unemployed is turning to any illegal trafficking, the mafia is easily finding recruits and social security contributions are being abused.</p>
<p>Flemish politicians, especially those to the far right, have claimed the system is only corrupt in what they call a crime-ridden south.</p>
<p>The talk of benefit abuse was reminiscent of a spat late in 1995 between the north and the south after a leading Flemish Christian Democrat accused Wallonia of living off Flanders.</p>
<p>Walloon politicians, struggling to unite in the face of an increasingly independence-minded Flanders, reject the accusations, saying the paedophile gang could have been based anywhere and corruption and organised crime are country-wide.</p>
<p>Speaking at this weekend's annual Wallonia festival, Walloon regional prime minister Robert Collignon rejected the way the Flemish media were "spitting on Wallonia in these difficult circumstances" and had painted the region in a despicable and scandalous light.</p>
<p>Television station VTM, which Collignon had named as one of the culprits, denied it had made any links between the scandals and the socio-economic situation in Wallonia and that Collignon must not have been watching the station well.</p>
<p>In his speech Collignon announced Wallonia would seek closer ties with France, "a country with which we share a language and a culture." He noted most Wallonians lived closer to Paris than a majority of the French.</p>
<p>He was not the first francophone politician to talk about a rapprochment with France. Others have threatened to break away from federal Belgium if the Flemish persisted in their separatist efforts.</p>
<p>Collignon's attack on the north followed accusations by francophone socialists from the region around the eastern town of Liege that a leading Flemish Christian Democrat was seeking to make political capital out of the scandals in the south.</p>
<p>Marc Van Peel, chairman of Christian Democrat CVP party -- the main partner in the ruling national coalition -- had expressed his digust at the fact a couple at the heart of the peadophile gang received generous social benefits, while the husband owned half a dozen properties.</p>
<p>Van Peel had said Walloon authorities had been lax in vetting these applicants for benefits.</p>
<p>The husband, Marc Dutroux, is the chief suspect in the peadophilia case. A convicted child rapist, this unemployed father of three has admitted kidnapping at least six girls, four of whom have been found dead.</p>
<p>Michelle Martin, his second wife, has been charged as an accomplice.</p>
<p>In the Cools murder case six people have been arrested, including Alain van der Biest, a former regional and federal minister and mayor of a Liege suburb. Like Cools, Van der Biest is a francophone socialist.</p>
<p>Van der Biest, named by an anonymous informer who provided police with ample details of the preparations of the murder, has been charged with the murder but has denied any involvement.</p>
