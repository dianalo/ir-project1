<p>Actor Valentine Pelka said it was like being shipwrecked on a desert island. And for once, the theatre critics agreed.</p>
<p>In an unusual experiment designed to cool the age-old animosity between actors and critics, four British theatre reviewers have crossed the footlights to direct a play and subjected their efforts to the mercy of their erstwhile victims.</p>
<p>"It has been a fairly monumental struggle. I doubt very much whether the four involved will want to do it again," said Ben Chamberlain, spokesman for the "Critics up for Review" season.</p>
<p>The idea of pitting the so-called "luvvies" of the theatre world against the men with the poison pens was dreamed up by theatre producer Lawrence Elman after a heated argument with Evening Standard critic Nicholas De Jongh.</p>
<p>Director Michael Bogdanov later weighed in with a ferocious newspaper attack on critics as "vicious, vituperative, vitriolic and toadying."</p>
<p>So it was a brave quartet of reviewers that turned up at London's fringe Battersea Arts Centre four weeks ago to start rehearsals of their own chosen plays with a cast of professional actors and designers.</p>
<p>De Jongh, directing a Jean Anouilh play, said it was one of the most awful ordeals of his life.</p>
<p>"It felt at times like a long stroll on a narrow tightrope with fear of being laughed at whenever I tumbled," he said. "Every critic should go through the fire of the experience."</p>
<p>The cast concurred. "We are a tribe on a desert island. He has got shipwrecked," said Valentine Pelka bluntly.</p>
<p>"It has been very interesting finding out how little critics know about getting a play on. On the whole, it has been a terrifying experience," agreed actress Faith Brook.</p>
<p>KEEP YOUR NIGHT JOBS, CRITICS TOLD</p>
<p>The eminent cast of directors who swopped roles to review the results advised the critics not to give up their night jobs.</p>
<p>Stephen Daldry, director of London's experimental Royal Court theatre, conceded that De Jongh had "acquitted himself with credit."</p>
<p>But in a sarcastic prelude relished by many an actor savaged by a bad review, Daldry confessed he was a terrible critic who had done everything wrong.</p>
<p>"I turned up on time and forgot to complain about my seat. I sat in the middle of a row and forgot to scribble furiously...I did not rush out of the auditorium at the curtain call pretending I had an urgent deadline to meet," he wrote.</p>
<p>Guardian newspaper critic Michael Billington had a similar baptism of fire.</p>
<p>"Michael Billington started his rehearsal in an absolute shambles of a room...and he thought 'My God this is impossible. We can't possibly rehearse in here.' But that's where artists who are developing have to work," said BAC director Tom Morris.</p>
<p>Playwright Mark Ravenhill described Billington's staging of a short Strindberg play as "pedestrian" and said the director struggled to keep up when his Harold Pinter production entered murky waters.</p>
<p>Former National Theatre chief Sir Peter Hall initially entered into the project with gusto.</p>
<p>But he soon had misgivings after other critics dismissed the venture as amateurish and struggling actors attacked it for diverting much-needed funds away from real theatre.</p>
<p>"I thought it would be fun -- a sort of world turned upside down experiment that might raise awareness and get space for the theatre," Hall wrote in his review of Times critic Jeremy Kingston's production of a little-known Michael Tremblay piece.</p>
<p>But Hall regretfully did not like the play itself and gave Kingston only five out of 10.</p>
<p>"I would advise Mr Kingston not to give up his night job. And I'm sure he will give the same advice to me. It honestly wasn't worth all the effort," he wrote.</p>
<p>De Jongh said the experience had changed his outlook and made him more willing "to tap the milk of human kindness a little more frequently".</p>
<p>But the theatre world was mostly unmoved.</p>
<p>Bogdanov welcomed the fact that critics had been given a glimpse behind the curtains but said he had not changed his low opinion of them.</p>
<p>"My feeling about English theatre critics is exactly the same. They don't, a lot of them, have very much knowledge of what goes into the making a production," he said.</p>
<p>The Royal Court's Daldry resisted the temptation to wreak revenge but questioned whether the project was not merely "an exercise in parasitic media claptrap".</p>
<p>"Perhaps we should condemn this event as an obscenity given the difficulty genuine emerging directors have in getting their work resourced and seen," Daldry wrote.</p>
