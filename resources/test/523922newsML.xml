<p>Hamburg side St Pauli, facing relegation from the German Bundesliga, sacked coach Uli Maslo on Monday and appointed assistant Klaus-Peter Nemet as his replacement until the end of the season.</p>
<p>Maslo led the club into the Bundesliga in 1995 after less than a year in charge but recent performances have been disappointing and the team are now languishing one from bottom.</p>
<p>The final straw for the St Pauli board was a dismal 4-0 defeat away to bottom side Freiburg on Saturday.</p>
<p>Angry fans staged a sit-down protest in front of the team bus after the match and only moved after Maslo and several players came out to apologise for their performance.</p>
