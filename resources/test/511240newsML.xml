<headline>Magistrate asks inspection of sunken Albanian boat.</headline>

<p>A magistrate on Tuesday ordered an underwater inspection of an Albanian refugee boat that sank after colliding with an Italian navy ship, killing as many as 83 people.</p>
<p>The inspection will decide if the ship, a coastal patrol boat, can be raised in an attempt to determine the exact cause of the March 28 accident and recover the bodies of victims believed trapped below decks.</p>
<p>Brindisi deputy prosecutor Leonardo Leone De Castris, who is heading investigations, said he would summon experts to his office next week to discuss the underwater inspection.</p>
<p>The sinking led to a wave of anti-Italian sentiment in Albania, where an Italian-led military force began deploying on Tuesday on a mission to protect relief deliveries to the anarchic Balkan state.</p>
<p>The small Albanian vessel was crowded with refugees from the southern port of Vlore who were trying to reach Italy. It capsized and sank after colliding with an Italian corvette trying to turn it away.</p>
<p>Four bodies were recovered and 34 people rescued on the night of the accident. Albanian officials say 83 other people were on board and were probably trapped inside.</p>
<p>The Italian navy has rejected accusations from some survivors that it was to blame for the accident. It says the accident occurred after the boat cut into its path.</p>
