<p>Deregulating the services sector is crucial to promoting employment, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said, noting faster jobs creation remains the best way to help low-income families.</p>
<p>"Given that globalisation frequently generates a need to shift resources from tradable to non-tradable sectors, deregulation of the services sector is of principal importance in preventing employment from falling," BIS said in its 67th annual report.</p>
<p>But in many cases high minimum wages relative to labour productivity and concerns about equity prevent service businesses from absorbing redundant resources, it added.</p>
<p>While many countries are wary of letting income disparities widen the gulf between rich and poor, "faster employment growth tends to be the most equitable and effective way of improving the prospects for low-income households".</p>
<p>BIS pointed out that unemployment in some big continental European countries has hit its highest levels since the 1930s.</p>
<p>Half of the world's 35 million unemployed last year were in European Union (EU) countries, where the jobless rate averaged 11.5 percent. The situation was better in places like the United States and Britain, where the business cycle was more advanced.</p>
<p>It said changes to "enhance the influence of market forces and remove disincentives to work," while helping to lower unemployment, were not a blanket solution.</p>
<p>Britain has gone further down this road than most other European countries by curtailing unions' power, decentralising wage bargaining, tightening rules on social benefits, lowering benefit rates and "virtually abolishing minimum wages." It also said that real earnings had risen less than in the 1980s.</p>
<p>But it noted employment in Britain "has been stagnant in the 1990s," given that the gains came mainly from the fact that a growing number of persons were "non-active," meaning they left the workforce or don't join it at all.</p>
<p>It also said that cuts in working hours worked best to reduce unemployment when the reductions were voluntary, which it said was the case in Britain and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>In the case of Germany, it said that compulsory cuts in hours worked less well, adding that over 40 percent of all jobs in Germany were still in industry and thus less suitable for part-time work than jobs in the service sector. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340</p>
