<p>Jordan's state security court on Wednesday sentenced nine Moslem fundamentalists to prison terms from two years to life on charges of plotting attacks against Israel and slandering King Hussein.</p>
<p>The sentenced militants were among 13 members of an illegal group called Baiyat al-Imam (Allegiance to the Islamic ruler) arrested in a crackdown on Moslem militants from December 1993 to March 1994.</p>
<p>The charges ranged from illegal possession of grenades, their manufacture and attempt to use for violence and loss of life and slander of King Hussein.</p>
<p>Four were found not guilty for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>"Allahu Akbar (God is Greatest), history will write the secret of our jihad (holy struggle), the voice of jihad will not weaken," the group's leader Issam Mohammed Taher Mohamed, better known as Abu Mohammed al-Maqdisi, chanted as the verdicts were passed by state security judge Colonel Yusef Faouri.</p>
<p>"Your sentences will only increase our faith in our religion, victory until jihad," said al-Maqdisi, 35, a spiritual mentor for many Moslem militants he met in Afghanistan, who was sentenced to 15 years for possession of explosives.</p>
<p>His name appeared in confessions given by one of four Saudi men who were beheaded this year for bombing a U.S. military complex in Saudi Arabia in November 1995.</p>
<p>Mustapha Hassan Musa, 22, the only one sentenced to death, had his sentence commuted to life imprisonment.</p>
<p>The judge said the court found proof that explosives he made from his experience fighting alongside Moslem Afghan groups in the late 1980s were aimed at "terrorist actions and causing loss of life" against Israeli targets in the occupied West Bank.</p>
<p>Most of the convicted are of Palestinian origin who believe in Israel's destruction.</p>
<p>Two other militants Ahmad Fadeel Nazal al-Khalayleh, 28, and Suleiman Taleb Ahmad Damra 27, were also given 15 year sentences. Khaled Mustapha Khalifa al-Arouri, 27, was given a 10 year sentence.</p>
<p>Two defendants, Mohammed Wasfi Omar Abu-Khalil, 33, and Nasri Izzedin Mohammed al-Tahayneh, 24, were found not quilty on lack of suficient evidence, the state security judge said.</p>
<p>Four other accomplices already freed on bail after at least two years detentions, were sentenced for terms ranging from two to two and a half years on slander charges against the king. Two other accomplices were found innocent and immediately released.</p>
<p>Faouri said the court rejected the defendants' allegations their testimonies to the state prosecutor were extracted under "duress and beatings" in the presence of intelligence officers.</p>
<p>The court said Maqdisi, who came to settle in Jordan after fleeing Kuwait in 1992, smuggled with him seven grenades and four mines left by the Iraqi occupation forces to use it inside Jordan illegally.</p>
<p>The state prosecutor said in secret meetings members deliberated "on the nature of the regime" in Jordan and they all had "concurred on describing King Hussein as an infidel".</p>
