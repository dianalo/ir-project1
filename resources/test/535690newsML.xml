<p>Blue-chip stocks closed lower Thursday, giving back strong early gains sparked by IBM's robust earnings, as the market was unable to shake off a jump in long-term interest rates.</p>
<p>Based on early and unofficial data, the Dow Jones industrial average closed 20.47 points lower at 6,792.25, having surrendered a first hour rally of nearly 80 points.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances by a modest margin on moderately active volume of 489 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
