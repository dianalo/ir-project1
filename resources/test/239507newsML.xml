<p>Tanzania banned economic activity in camps for Rwandan Hutu refugees and restricted their movements on Friday, a day after telling more than half a million refugees to go back to Rwanda by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Government officials said the ban on economic activity would first be enforced in five refugee camps in the northwest Karagwe district. The government would also introduce an exclusion zone around the camps, they said.</p>
<p>"Definitely that (economic activity) has to stop. They (refugees) cannot continue that. When you ask people to go home, they should start packing to go," said Cyprien Majengo, director of information at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Tanzania's government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Thursday told the Rwandan refugees to return home by the end of December.</p>
<p>Some 542,000 Rwandan Hutus fled to Tanzania in 1994 during civil war and genocide of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis and Hutu moderates by Hutu troops, militiamen and mobs in Rwanda.</p>
<p>Officials said stopping refugees from indulging in the lucrative trading business was a sure way of piling pressure on them to return. Refugees operate their own markets, shops and schools, as well as agricultural plots for home-grown produce.</p>
<p>UNHCR deputy representative in Tanzania, Lennart Kotsalainen, confirmed the economic squeeze on the refugee camps, saying he expected it to move to larger camps further west in the Ngara district.</p>
<p>In the Rwandan capital Kigali, UNHCR spokesman Paul Stromberg, said some 790 refugees in Ngara had registered to repatriate.</p>
<p>"In Karagwe, the district commissioner announced all economic activity in the camps would be closed down. Permits to move outside the camps will be limited to medical reasons," Kotsalainen told Reuters.</p>
<p>"I think the refugees to a large degree have been expecting this. The refugees know to a great extent what happened in Zaire," said Kotsalainen.</p>
<p>Last month 600,000 Rwandan Hutus returned home from eastern Zaire, where war is raging between rebels and the Zairean army.</p>
<p>Kotsalainen said Tanzanian police would also enforce a four-km (2.5-mile) exclusion zone around the teeming camps.</p>
<p>Many refugees in Tanzania refuse to go home because they fear they might be jailed or attacked in reprisal for the genocide, which some took part in.</p>
<p>Stromberg said the U.N. refugee agency planned to run a convoy to take back home refugees who had so far registered.</p>
<p>"Some 790 people have registered so we are planning to run a convoy tomorrow (Saturday). There is obviously a major change in the state of play in Ngara," Stromberg said.</p>
<p>Aid workers and the Rwandan government are preparing for a mass influx of refugees to Kibungo province in the east of the tiny central African nation.</p>
