<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle sales near midday Thursday were slow at $63.00 per cwt, down $1.00 from this week's active sales, but too light for an adequate market test, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>About 500 slaughter steers and heifers that will likely grade select and choice sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area, bringing weekly movement there near 129,500 head, cattle feeders there said.</p>
<p>In Kansas, about 100 steers sold and will likely grade select and choice. Weekly sales there hit a record-large 140,500 head, USDA reported.  </p>
<p>Sales volume bulged amid active trading beginning last Friday, with some of the sales involving animals not sold during the previous week, sources said.</p>
<p>"This week's volume was skewed by the fact people waited so long to sell their cattle last week," a Kansas feedlot operator said.</p>
<p>Another round of lively sales on Tuesday pushed weekly volume to a record in Kansas and a hefty number in the Panhandle area. Prices skipped on lower beef prices and outlooks for expanded cattle supplies this summer following large spring and late winter placements, sources said.</p>
