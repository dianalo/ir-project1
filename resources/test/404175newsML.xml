<p>A Mexican sugar mill in the southeastern state of Yucatan is around 40 percent behind its production scheduled because of "infrastructure problems", the state news agency Notimex said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Citing Candido Solis Torres, Yucatan state Economic Promotion and Rural Development Minister, Notimex said the San Rafael mill has this cycle only milled 385,000 tonnes of cane whereas it was programmed to have processed 700,000 to date.</p>
<p>San Rafael, close to the border with Belize, is programmed to mill 1.2 million tonnes of cane to yield more than 100,000 tonnes of sugar.</p>
<p>Solis Torres said the mill is currently processing around 6,500 tonnes of cane per day when it was originally expected to mill between 7,000 to 8,000 tonnes per day.</p>
<p>Mill owners and cane growers have decided to extend the harvest one month beyond the original mid-May end date for milling. Now cane will be cut and handed over to June 25.</p>
<p>Mexico's 62 active mills coordinate cane growing and cutting with farmers to have continuous supplies of raw material being processed in a bid to optimise productivity and yields.</p>
