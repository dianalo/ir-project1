<p>Castorseed September delivery lifted further to 1,167/1,168 rupees per quintal from 1,161/1,162 rupees on fresh speculative buying on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>A drop in arrivals at producing centres coupled with fresh overseas enquiries prompted continued bull support. Daily average arrivals of castorseed in Gujarat dropped to 4,000/5,000 bags (75 kg each) against the earlier 8,000/10,000 bags.</p>
<p>"The forward market commission has granted permission for December delivery and Bombay traders will commence trading in the December delivery from Tuesday," one operator said.</p>
<p>Groundnut oil looked up from 370/372 rupees to 373/374 rupees per 10 kg on the back of higher physical support for the approaching festival season coupled with a limited inflow of 40/50 tonnes.</p>
<p>In Rajkot spot groundnut oil was steady at 595 rupees per 15 kg.</p>
<p>In Bombay imported palm-oil rose by 3/4 rupees at 257 rupees per 10 kg on higher outstation buying for the festive season.</p>
<p>Sentiment at the close remained subdued as traders were expecting higher arrivals of imported palm-oil in the coming days at Bombay port.</p>
<p>"Bombay port will receive inflow of 25,000/30,000 tonnes of imported palm-oil during the first two weeks of current month," one importer said.</p>
