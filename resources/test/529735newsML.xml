<p>The Halifax Building Society said on Tuesday it has begun to send out details of individual share allocations for its June 2 stock market flotation.</p>
<p>Borrowing and saving members who qualify will have to complete and return a share claim form by May 26 in order to receive their entitlement.</p>
<p>Halifax is offering a new special share account for shareholders to keep their shares in and is also offering facilities for the sale of shares.</p>
<p>Halifax said it will sell free shares sold by members to financial institutions in a real price auction for which it will perform a bookbuilding operation in the run up to the conversion.</p>
<p>The Halifax will publish a price in the press on April 28 which will form the minimum that shareholders will receive and the shares will not be sold unless this price can be achieved.</p>
<p>It will hold further auctions if necessary for shares tendered for sale by members after May 26.</p>
<p>In all cases, members will receive the weighted average of the price bid by institutions.</p>
