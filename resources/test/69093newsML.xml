<p>Benfica ousted Portuguese champions Porto from the top of the table when they beat bottom-placed Uniao de Leiria 2-0 away on Sunday.</p>
<p>Portugal's top three, Benfica, Sporting and Porto are now level with 10 points each but Benfica, who suffered a humiliating 5-0 defeat to Porto in the midweek Supercup final, lead on goal difference.</p>
<p>Benfica, who meet Poland's Ruch Chorzow in the second leg of the European Cup Winner's Cup on Thursday, had a lukewarm first half devoid of real goal chances.</p>
<p>But they opened the scoring in the 75th minute when Romanian midfielder Nica Panduru finished a solo effort whihc started from outside the area.</p>
<p>The Lisbon team sealed their victory three minutes from the final whistle with a goal by Brazilian striker Osmar Donizete after a cross from compatriot Valdo Filho.</p>
<p>Porto, who play Gothenburg of Sweden in the European Champion's League on Wednesday, won 1-0 at Salgueiros on Saturday.</p>
<p>Sporting beat Maritimo 3-0 at home on Friday ahead of the UEFA Cup match against France's Montpellier on Tuesday in Lisbon after 1-1 draw in the first leg.</p>
