<title>USA: MGE spring wheat higher on short covering.</title>

<p>MGE spring wheat futures were higher at the midsession as commercials covered their short positions in the March contract, traders said.</p>
<p>"What's going on is that most of the hedging up here has moved to the March contract, so the commercials -- who are short March for the most part -- are rolling out to May. In doing that, they've got to buy their way out of the March," a trader said.</p>
<p>Spring wheat was also buoyed by support from CBOT wheat, which gained on spillover strength from fund buying in the soy complex, traders said.</p>
<p>At 1112 CST, MGE spring wheat was 1/2 to four cents per bushel higher, with March up 1/2 cent at $3.92. May was up two cents at $3.73.</p>
<p>Traders said March was trailing the May at the midsession because of ideas that the March/May spread had closed out of line Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The spread settled at 20-1/2 cents (per bushel), but it's more like a 19-cent item," a broker said.</p>
