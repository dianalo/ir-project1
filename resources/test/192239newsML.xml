<p>Colombia's peso rose 3.7 to close at 995.7 pesos to the dollar as greenbacks flooded currency markets on Friday, interbank traders said.</p>
<p>"The rate opened around 1,000 pesos to the dollar, but about 10am the dollar began to dive as industry pumped export earnings into the market," a private bank trader said.</p>
<p>He said the key oil, coffee and coal sectors were all trading in greenbacks. Although the central bank's co-director Hernando Jose Gomez said the central bank would intervene more heavily in 1997 to ensure the devaluation of the peso to a more realistic rate, it did not step in on Friday.  </p>
<p>"There was little demand for dollars and there was little chance of reining in the peso's rise," another interbank dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers reported 355 trades worth $141.7 million. The peso opened at 999.7 to the dollar. It hit an intraday low of 1,000.15 and closed at the high of 995.7, its highest since January 5.</p>
