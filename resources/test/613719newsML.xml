<p>Brazilian private power utility Light plans to spend up to 140 million reais to expand capacity at two power generating plants to meet growing demand, said the company's president Michel Gaillard.</p>
<p>"Our priority today is generation, more generation," Gaillard told reporters during a break of a conference on Brazil's power privatizations.</p>
<p>Demand in Light's distribution area is expected to grow between four and five percent this year, he said.  </p>
<p>Gaillard also said Light hopes to participate in the July 10 privatization auction of Rio de Janeiro state gas company Companhia Estadual de Gas (CEG).</p>
<p>He did not give further details, except for saying that Light is studying other selloffs in Brazil's power sector.</p>
<p>Light was privatized in May 1996 and bought by France's EDF, U.S. power operators Houston Industries Inc and AES Corp and local investors.</p>
