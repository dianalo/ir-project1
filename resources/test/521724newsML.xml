<p>Shares in Italian clothing group Stefanel plunged on Friday as the loss-making company denied plans to sell out to the new powerful force in Italian textiles, the combined HPI-Marzotto grouping.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Stefanel shares rose sharply as talk of a merger intensified, but on Friday the head of the controlling Stefanel family, Guiseppe Stefanel, denied the merger story in an interview with La Repubblica newspaper.</p>
<p>Stefanel shares fell sharply and were soon suspended the 10 percent limit down on the Milan bourse after a close on Thursday at 3,287 lire in a generally easier Italian stock market.</p>
<p>Stefanel is going through a round of restructuring which it had initially hoped to bring it back to breakeven in 1996 from a net loss of 69.4 billion lire in 1995. But the group said in March it expected a loss of 16 billion lire for 1996 and pushed break-even hopes out till 1997. It expected to make money only in 1998.</p>
<p>Analysts said that the group had struggled to get a grip of its business. The selling off of non-strategic businesses, a focus on core interests, a shake-up of the group's organisation and a deal with HPI-Marzotto was seen likely to help this process.</p>
<p>"The company has clearly had a lot to do to get its act in order. Rather than wait an extra year the market was hoping for a quick solution," said one Milan-based analyst.</p>
<p>HPI-Marzotto itself is a merger that was only announced last month linking Marzotto with the industrial holdings of the Gemina financial holding company producing a company with two-third of sales from textile and one third from publishing.</p>
<p>Analysts say Stefanel has been slow to restructure and compete with rival Italian textile groups such as Benetton and Marzotto. The question is whether it can do this alone or within a larger grouping, they add.</p>
<p>Stefanel has linked up with U.S. designer Calvin Klein in a joint venture to open a series of joint outlets selling the CK Calvin Klein line. But with the first outlet only opening in Milan last month, analysts say it will take some time for the venture to make significant profits.</p>
