<p>Iraqi oil minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed said on Tuesday that his country would start exporting oil again once the aid distribution plan had been finalised in seven to 10 days.</p>
<p>He told reporters on arrival for OPEC's summer conference it would start exports at 730,000 to 750,000 barrels per day.  </p>
<p>"We will start exporting oil when the distribution plan is finalised between the Iraqi government and the (U.N.) Secretary General. There is some consultation going on. In 10 days we will start exporting oil we hope," he said.</p>
<p>Rasheed said that no contracts had been signed for the second tranche of the U.N. oil-for-food deal and that price formulas were still being discussed.  </p>
<p>Asked if Iraq had signed any contracts with oil companies Rasheed said: "No, we are still waiting...(but) we have very good working relationships and we are discussing with many firms and we have indications of their requirements".</p>
<p>Rasheed said he did not foresee any difficulty in exporting the entire $2.14 billion of oil within the allowed 180 days.</p>
<p>"We don't see any difficulty in exporting the quantity, even though now we have almost two or three weeks (elapsed) since June 8 (when the second phase of the deal began). There is absolutely no problem".</p>
