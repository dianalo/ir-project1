<p>Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Oakes reiterated a buy rating on America Online Inc, saying that the company's credit/refund plan to address its subscriber complaints will not have an impact on earnings.</p>
<p>"We estimate a worst-case scenario is that AOL refunds about $16 million -- this will have no impact on our earnings estimates since it will be funded by the $500 million marketing budget," Oakes said in a note to clients.</p>
<p>Wednesday, AOL announced a plan to appease its angry subscribers, who are encountering busy signal problems, by offering refunds or credits of online time, upon request.  </p>
<p>Oakes also said that he believes the agreement with the 36 state attorneys general will nullify any of the class action lawsuits that have been filed against AOL.</p>
<p>He also said that because AOL is focusing on its current subscribers and cutting back on its hefty marketing expenses, AOL will transition more quickly into an earnings story.</p>
<p>AOL shares jumped 3/4 to 38.</p>
