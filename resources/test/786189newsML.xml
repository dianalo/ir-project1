<p>Shares in Norwegian offshore supply company Aker Maritime ASA jumped more than nine percent on Thursday after the group presented better than expected results for the first half 1997.</p>
<p>At 0930 GMT, Aker Maritime stood at a high so far at 130 crowns, a rise of 11 crowns or 9.24 percent. Turnover in the company was 12 million crowns.</p>
<p>Aker Maritime posted a 23 percent rise in first-half revenues to 6.06 billion crowns compared with 4.94 billion in the same 1996 period due to higher activity in operations and the acquisition of new companies.</p>
<p>However, a 120 million crown provision in the second quarter resulting from a dispute with Norsk Hydro ASA over the Njord oil platform, reduced half-year operating profits by more than a third to 96 million crowns against 151 million crowns.</p>
