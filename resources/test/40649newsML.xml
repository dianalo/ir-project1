<p>RailTex said Monday it expects to take a $600,000 charge in the third quarter equalling $0.07 per share.</p>
<p>The company said the charge is due to casualty losses affected by an increase in its self-insured retentions in the third quarter.</p>
<p>For the second quarter RailTex reported per share earnings of $0.28, including an after-tax charge of $1.39 million, or $0.15 a share.  </p>
<p>The expected $600,000 charge for the third quarter comes from a derailment and a personal injury claim that happened after RailTex increased its self-insured retentions, which raised its deductible, said Joe Jahnke, the company's treasury manager.</p>
<p>The company is scheduled to report its third quarter earnings November 6, Jahnke said.</p>
<p>RailTex said August carloadings on a "same railroad" basis increased 11.5 percent. For the year-to-date, carloadings on a "same railroad" basis increased 10.5 percent.</p>
