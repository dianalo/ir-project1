<p>South Korea will invite tenders for a total of 5,000 tonnes of pork in October to ease domestic prices, an official at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry said on Friday.</p>
<p>The purchase is over and above South Korea's Minimum Market Access requirement of 23,392 tonnes this year under World Trade Organisation rules. South Korea has already bought exactly that amount, a ministry official said.  </p>
<p>The official said Denmark had supplied 50 percent of the minimum access requirement, the United States 17 percent and the rest came from Britain and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The ministry on Thursday instructed the National Livestock Cooperative Federation to go ahead with the tenders.</p>
<p>A total of 3,000 tonnes will be invited for early October to cover an expected shortage following the Korean Thanksgiving holiday from September 26 to 29 when demand for meat rises.</p>
<p>Delivery for that consignment will be early November. Tenders for the other 2,000 tonnes would be held later in October, the official said.  </p>
<p>The government has already announced it will open the pork market from July next year.</p>
<p>In the first six months of next year, before the liberalisation takes effect, South Korea will import 14,620 tonnes of pork, the official said.</p>
<p>Last year South Korea imported 17,544 tonnes of pork under minimum market access requirements.</p>
