<p>Japan's domestic vehicle sales rose in October for the second straight month as customers snapped up a range of new models, putting the industry on track to beat last year's overall sales figure.</p>
<p>The Japan Automobile Dealers Association (JADA) said on Friday that domestic vehicle sales rose a solid 8.4 percent in October from same month a year earlier to 447,278 units, in another sign of vigour in Japan's car market.</p>
<p>The rise means the car industry looks like selling 5.20 million cars in the home market in this calendar year, exceeding last year's total of 5.15 million units.</p>
<p>The next few months are also likely to see rising car sales as motorists rush to buy ahead of a planned increase in Japan's sales tax in April to five percent from three percent, the industry body said.</p>
<p>October's figures were boosted by demand for new models, including popular recreational vehicles (RVs) and roomy estate cars. Most car makers saw sales rise, with Honda enjoying a particularly strong leap due to demand for its sporty RVs.</p>
<p>Sales of imported vehicles also made headway, rising 11.6 percent from a year earlier to 33,550 in October, JADA said.</p>
<p>"Japan's domestic vehicle sales are likely to mark gains this month and December as well, in view of current demand for new models, and are likely to reach 5.20 million units in the full year," a JADA official said. The 5.15 million total in 1995 was a rise of 4.8 percent from the previous year.</p>
<p>Sales by Toyota, Japan's biggest car maker, rose 9.7 percent from a year earlier to 195,499, taking the company's share of the domestic market to 43.7 percent. This was the first time Toyota topped the 40 percent mark in almost a year.</p>
<p>The rise was due to demand for new models like Toyota's Mark II mainstay luxury car and Ipsum minivan, a Toyota spokesman said. Toyota has launched 10 new models in 1996.</p>
<p>In contrast, Nissan's sales fell 9.7 percent to 74,658 in October. Nissan said the drop reflected high post-launch sales of certain models last year as well as slower than expected sales for RVs.</p>
<p>Honda's domestic sales rose 47 percent from a year earlier to 50,258 in October, boosted by sales of its RVs such as the new Step Wagon and the Odyssey.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Motors Corp's sales increased by 23 percent to 36,845, fuelled by demand for its new Galant sedan and Legnum station wagon.</p>
<p>Daihatsu sales rose 273 percent to 4,102 units, propelled by robust sales of its new Pyzar compact minivan.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year, which ends in March, sales are likely to post a substantial rise compared with the 5.17 million vehicles sold in fiscal 1995/96 due to the planned increase in the sales tax, the JADA official said.</p>
