<p>Stratosphere Corp Wednesday reported cash flow for the five weeks ended March 30 was $2,281,629, bringing the casino's average monthly cash flow for the six-months ended in March to $1,726,718.</p>
<p>Under a current debt restructuring plan, Stratosphere must maintain an average monthly operating cash flow of $2.267 million between October 1996 and June 1997.</p>
<p>In a statement, Stratosphere said it has been informed by Grand Casinos Inc that Grand will not waive the condition that Stratosphere maintain that average cash flow target. Further, Stratosphere said Grand Casinos believes Stratosphere is not likely to satisfy the cash flow target.</p>
<p>Grand has advised Stratosphere it is prepared to explore with the company and the company's Noteholders Committee alternatives for a consensual reorganization.</p>
<p>Stratosphere said Grand also indicated if an alternative consensual agreement cannot be reached and conditions to the pending plan of reorganization and related investment agreement are not met, Grand may propose or participate in alternative plans of reorganization or may terminate altogether its participation in the bankruptcy process.</p>
<p>Stratosphere is currently in a pre-packaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding and is required to make the cash flow statements as part of its agreement with holders of its notes.</p>
