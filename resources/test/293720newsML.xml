<p>U.S. spot No. 2 oil prices jumped higher by late Wednesday trade, boosted by forecasts for colder-than-normal temperatures in the Northeast through next week.</p>
<p>No. 2 oil prices on the NYMEX surged nearly a penny by the close, though differentials saw little movement in New York Harbor (NYH). U.S. Gulf (USG) heat diffs dipped slightly in modest trading activity.</p>
<p>Market players said the expectations for the colder temperatures in the Northeast, the key heating oil demand area, overrode modestly bearish weekly inventory reports.</p>
<p>Spot gasoline prices edged lower as the modest dip in diffs outpaced the slight bump higher on the NYMEX.</p>
<p>"Gasoline's a little heavy," one trader said. "Buyers are kind of taking their time and picking up barrels when they need them," he added.</p>
<p>Tuesday evening's American Petroleum Institute (API) report showed a jump in gasoline stocks of 4.3 million barrels, while Wednesday's Energy Information Agency numbers showed a larger 6.2 million barrel build.</p>
<p>The API showed U.S. distillate stocks rose 2.9 million barrels, while the EIA put the build of 3.1 million barrels.</p>
<p>USG No. 2 oil for the 1st cycle on the Colonial Pipeline was offered at 4.50 cents under the screen late in the day, about 0.25 cent below Tuesday's level.</p>
<p>USG conventional unleaded M4 offers for the second Colonial cycle dipped about 0.10 cent to sit at 2.35 cents under the screen, while reformulated A4 87-octane offers fell to about 0.40 cent, down about 0.20 cent.</p>
