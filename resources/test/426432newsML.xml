<p>Minority shareholders in Brazilian mining group Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD) can sell their voting shares at the April 29 auction of a controlling stake in the firm, the government said.</p>
<p>In a notice published in the Gazeta Mercantil newspaper, the National Development Bank (BNDES) said minority shareholders had from March 14 to April 14 to register their shares for sale.  </p>
<p>It said minority shareholders and the government, which holds 76 percent of CVRD's voting shares and 6.3 percent of its preferred shares, would be represented in the auction by Rio de Janeiro stock exchange and would not pay dealing costs.</p>
<p>The notice reiterated that the government had set a minimum price of 26.67 reais per share for the sell-off, valuing the world's largest iron ore exporter at 10.36 billion reais.  </p>
<p>Brazil will sell an initial 45 percent of voting shares on April 29, hoping to raise more than $3.0 billion. The block sale will form a Special Purpose Company, or holding, known as Valecom.</p>
<p>The BNDES said 45 percent of CVRD's voting shares was the maximum for the sale. Shares from minority shareholders would be added to the government's and they would receive cash, payable on May 5.</p>
<p>The auction of Valecom will be followed immediately by the sale of 5.1 percent of CVRD's capital to staff and a global offering of the government's remaining voting shares within nine months or hopefully by year's end.</p>
