<p>The New York Stock Exchange said Tuesday it will suspend the trading of Centennial Technologies Inc's common stock on March 3 and will afterwards apply with federal regulators to delist the stock.</p>
<p>The Big Board announced these steps after Centennial disclosed it expects to restate certain financial reports because certain of its financial records appear to have been falsified.</p>
<p>The company's announcement followed the arrest of its former chief financial executive on Friday on alleged charges of insider trading, securities fraud and inventory manipulation.</p>
