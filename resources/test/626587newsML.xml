<p>Temperatures were cool in Brazil's key coffee regions but heavy cloud cover prevented them from dropping to critical levels in Parana, Sao Paulo and the south of Minas Gerais, independent meteorologist Somar said.</p>
<p>"The presence of a cold air mass maintained temperatures low, with a minimum of 9 degrees Centigrade in the Pocos de Caldas region," Somar said in a daily bulletin.</p>
<p>There were no frosts expected in the coffee growing regions over the weekend, with sunshine forecast in Parana and the southeast.</p>
<p>Overnight temperatures were seen dropping to eight degrees C in the north of Parana, 10 degrees C in Sao Paulo and five degrees C in southern Minas Gerais while in the Cerrado region, they should hover around 12 degrees C.</p>
<p>The mass of cold air will remain near the sea, affecting mostly the southern coastline rather than the interior, Somar said.</p>
<p>Traditionally, Brazil's coffee regions come under threat of frost from June to mid-August.</p>
