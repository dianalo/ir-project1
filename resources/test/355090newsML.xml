<p>The Labour party's goal of an integrated transport policy for Britain does not mean it intends to demonise car use, leader Tony Blair said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Blair told a conference that all forms of transport would have a role to play in framing a sustainable strategy.</p>
<p>"I want to see an end to the debate couched in terms of "road versus rail'. I am not interested in demonising the motor car. The focus of government policy needs to be offering people attractive alternatives to using their car. The task has to be getting a sustainable balance in car use," Blair said.</p>
<p>Blair said Labour's integrated transport policy would use planning and regulation to secure the public interest.</p>
<p>"Planning to ensure that transport facilities and inter-changes are developed in such a way as to make using the bus or train a more and more attractive option. Regulation to ensure public transport operators impartially make available information and ticketing for the whole network and deliver the services and investment they have agreed to," Blair said.</p>
<p>Britain, he added, had a serious transport problem. The future predicted pace of traffic growth was probably neither economically nor environmentally sustainable.  </p>
<p>A Labour government would address the imbalance between public and private transport and seek to minimise the environmental impact of each form of transport, Blair said.</p>
<p>A shift in emphasis from road building to road maintenance and traffic management would underlie its approach. Labour would also encourage further technological and regulatory progress in the area of fuel efficiency.</p>
<p>Making the rail network more attractive to passengers and freight would also be crucial, Blair added.</p>
<p>No sooner has the government privatised the rail industry than it is proposing to introduce yet heavier 44 tonne trucks to Britain, he said.</p>
<p>"Such a move would threaten a fifth of rail freight traffic and could lead to an additional 60 million lorry miles each year on our roads. We will look at the results of the government's consultation, but we have strong doubts such a move would make sense," Blair said.  </p>
<p>Public/private partnerships would also be crucial to Labour's transport strategy, Blair said.</p>
<p>He said business was critical of the way the government's Private Finance Initiative apportions risk and has become bogged down in red tape, thus leading to delays and adding to costs.</p>
<p>"Labour will ensure that government shoulders those risks which fall more appropriately within its remit, allowing the private sector to bear those risks which it is best able to manage," Blair said.</p>
<p>He promised to streamline the complex approval and planning process if necessary and said Labour would help the private sector to assess project risk by indicating the relative priorities on which a Labour government hopes to make progress.</p>
