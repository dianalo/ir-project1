<p>Two bombs exploded overnight on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica in what has become a nightly routine since separatist guerrillas called off a shaky truce earlier this month.</p>
<p>Police said no-one was hurt in the blasts, which wrecked a tax office in Bonifacio early on Tuesday and damaged a car rental office at the southern Figari airport late on Monday.</p>
<p>The latest blasts took to 17 the number of bomb attacks in the past 13 days. No-one has claimed responsibility for the attacks but police said they seemed part of a two-decade-old campaign by separatists for greater autonomy from Paris.</p>
<p>The outlawed Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC), one of the main guerrilla groups, ended a seven-month truce last week, accusing the government of reneging on secret commitments.</p>
