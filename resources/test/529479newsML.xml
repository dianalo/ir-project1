<p>French Prime Minister Alain Juppe pledged at the start of his election campaign on Tuesday to press on with state reform and privatisations, but stressed his government was not touting the extreme capitalism of the 1980s.</p>
<p>Juppe, outlining his platform to the ruling conservative coalition, said the economy was weighed down by debt built up by governments run by the opposition Socialists.</p>
<p>"We have to explain clearly to our compatriots that raising public spending...condemns the French economy to taxes, and therefore unemployment," he said.  </p>
<p>"To bring down spending, we have to step up the drive against waste but also expand structural reforms and redefine the state's role in the national economy, notably by continuing privatisations," Juppe said.</p>
<p>His address came a day after President Jacques Chirac said he would dissolve the National Assembly and call a two-round parliamentary election in May and June to confirm his mandate to bring France into European monetary union in 1999.</p>
<p>Juppe said his government aimed to "liberate enterprise" from heavy taxes and charges and remove the rigidities that discourage job-creation.</p>
<p>He said the solutions offered by the opposition Socialists were failed policies.</p>
<p>"But the selfish individualism, vulgar capitalism and simplistic hyperliberalism of the 1980s are equally outdated," he said.</p>
<p>Juppe said the government aimed to preserve solidarity in France, the dignity attached to public service, and a dialogue to avoid and resolve conflicts.</p>
