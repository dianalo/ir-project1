<p>Finnish telecoms group Nokia Oy said on Tuesday its first-quarter performance boosted its confidence for strong growth and good profitability in 1997.</p>
<p>"Our first quarter results give us further confidence in our previously stated positive outlook for strong growth and good profitability for 1997, but as always, actual performance will depend on a variety of external factors, including economic development in our major market areas and industry conditions," CEO Jorma Ollila said in a statement with the results.  </p>
<p>Ollila said Nokia was "continuing to build on our position as the world's number one digital mobile phone supplier and as one of the two leading GSM/DCS network suppliers."</p>
<p>"The operating efficiencies achieved by Nokia mobile phones as well as the continued strong results from Nokia telecommunications enhanced our leading position in many of the fastest growing segments in the telecommunications industry," he said.</p>
