<headline>Christopher tops Baker's diplomatic travel record.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-10-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Wednesday eclipsed his predecessor James Baker in a crucial area: the distance flown in a four-year term as the United States' top diplomat.</p>
<p>On the completion of a flight from Bamako, Mali, to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Christopher had flown 704,487 miles (1.134 million km) since taking office in January 1993, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a briefing.</p>
<p>Baker travelled 700,131 miles (1.127 million km), but he stepped down as secretary of State before his term was up to manage then-President George Bush's re-election campaign.</p>
<p>The all-time record, over six years, is still held by George Shultz, who had the job during the Reagan administration. He flew a total of 900,000 miles (1.448 million km).</p>
<p>Christopher celebrated in-flight with a cake, shared with his Air Force crew and others on the plane, Burns said.</p>
