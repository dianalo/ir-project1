<p>Hong Kong urged the United States on Friday to renew China's special trading privileges and said the territory's handover to the mainland on July 1 should not be linked to the issue.</p>
<p>"Attaching Hong Kong-related conditions will only bring uncertainty, which in turn will undermine confidence in Hong Kong," Chief Secretary Anson Chan told a business assembly.</p>
<p>Britain hands Hong Kong back to China at midnight on June 30 after more than 150 years of colonial rule. Analysts expect the transition to be a major focal point when the U.S. Congress debates the renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status.</p>
<p>Chan said withdrawal of MFN would cut Hong Kong's gross domestic product (GDP) growth by 2.0 to 2.8 percentage points, and would lead to a loss of 61,000 to 86,000 jobs.</p>
<p>"We can ill afford such an economic blow in this critical year of our transition," Chan, Hong Kong's top civil servant, said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's annual GDP growth was 4.7 percent in each of the past two years, and is forecast at 5.5 percent for 1997.</p>
<p>"And as MFN is a trade matter, our consistent position is that it should not be used as a tool to deal with non-trade issues," Chan said.</p>
<p>"So whilst we appreciate the interest in Hong Kong's future, we do not think it is a good idea to link Hong Kong's transition to the renewal exercise."</p>
<p>Hong Kong serves as an entrepot for China, and many Hong Kong manufacturers have moved their production bases to China to take advantage of lower production costs there.</p>
<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton has until June to decide on MFN, and Congress must then ratify that decision.</p>
