<p>An environmental group endorsed by 300 Canadian economists launched a media attack on the country's energy industry and politicians on Tuesday, blasting a lack of support for cutting greehouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The David Suzuki Foundation took out full-page newspaper advertisements to convince Canadian voters that the petroleum industry was influencing federal politicians to ignore a goal to stabilize greenhouse gases, believed to be the cause of global warming.</p>
<p>The foundation said the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers and Imperial Oil Ltd., the country's biggest oil producer and refiner, were devoting major resources to ensuring Canada did not agree to "drastic measures" to meet the goal at an upcoming summit in Kyoto, Japan.</p>
<p>At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janiero, Canada pledged to stabilize its greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by the year 2000 -- a target the ruling Liberal party, now campaigning for a June 2 federal election, has since said it could not meet.</p>
<p>"Tragically, instead of listening to experts, politicians blindly accept the self-serving nonsense from lobbyists like Imperial Oil, who much like the tobacco industry, deny there is a problem and fight against measures that would solve it," foundation executive director Jim Fulton said.</p>
<p>The energy industry -- Canada's third largest emitter of greenhouse gasses like carbon dioxide and methane -- undertook voluntary measures two years ago to cut emissions. The industry argues it must be given enough time to improve its performance without invoking government-mandated caps.</p>
<p>Voluntary reductions are a main plank in Canadian Natural Resources Minister Anne McLellan's energy policy.</p>
<p>The foundation, named for noted Canadian environmentalist and broadcaster David Suzuki, said politicians were ignoring the advice of 2,800 international economists, including 300 from Canada, who signed a statement this year saying a global warming threat was real and actions were needed to stop it.</p>
<p>The statement outlined several policies available to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in ways not harmful to North American living standards. These include market-based approaches like carbon taxes and tradable emissions permits.</p>
<p>Carbon taxes are an emotional issue, especially in western Canada where they are viewed by many as a potential grab for the region's prosperity by central Canadian powers, fears spawned from interventionist 1970s and 1980s energy policies.</p>
<p>CAPP, which represents 190 of Canada's largest oil and gas producers, said emissions caps would threaten the industry's financial wellbeing by adding new costs to already volatile market conditions.</p>
<p>It also argued that new taxes aimed at cutting emissions would hurt Canada's standard of living largely for symbolic reasons, because the country contributes only two percent of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.</p>
<p>"We do not say we shouldn't be doing everything we can at home," CAPP vice-president Chris Pierce said. "But while we're doing everything we can at home, we think it's a global problem and where the growth in emissions is going to be in the next 15 or 20 years is the developing world."</p>
<p>He said Canada should be given credit for exporting its environmental technology to other nations.</p>
<p>"What we want is for people to look at the science and there's just no question that the science is saying we are doing this to ourselves. We're conducting this experiment with the world," foundation spokesman David Hocking said.</p>
