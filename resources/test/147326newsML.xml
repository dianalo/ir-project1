<p>The Polish zloty was basically flat against the basket of currencies in light early trade ruled by dollar/mark changes in European trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the zloty was likely to track main currency trends because of the lack of domestic market moving factors and was seen remaining in a band between 1.70 and 1.85 percent from the trading band centre for most of the week.</p>
<p>"The zloty is straddling Friday's central bank fixing level at 1.82 percent from the parity rate -- a reasonable level for Monday," said Bogdan Stepkowski from ING Bank in Warsaw.  </p>
<p>At 0930 GMT the zloty was at 1.84/1.79 percent from the parity rate, basically flat from opening's 1.81/1.74 and last week's close at 1.82/1.78 percent.</p>
<p>It was at 2.8220/30 to the dollar, up from 2.8235/60 at 0810 GMT and at 1.8523/38 to the mark, flat from 1.8525/35.</p>
<p>On the money market one-day deposit rates inched up on Monday as banks fine-tuned required reserve positions before the end of the monthly reserve period on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Overnight rates rose to 19.20/19.35 percent by 0935 GMT from 18.95/19.25 at 0745. Tomorrow/next were at 19.25/19.40 percent against opening's 19.00/19.20.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the market had no immediate reaction to the central bank's weekend statements which signalled that the overliquid Polish money market would become short of cash next year if money supply grew as expected and that in 1997 market rates would converge with the lombard rate, now at 25 percent.</p>
<p>"It (the statement) is likely desinged to curb fast growing credit action, which the central bank is worried about," said one senior dealer at a Polish bank.</p>
<p>Dealers expected yields to hold flat at today's 950 million zloty T-bill auction, with bids doubling the offer.</p>
