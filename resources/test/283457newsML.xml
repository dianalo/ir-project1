<p>Pernilla Wiberg will have an advantage over rival Katja Seizinger when the pair resume their Alpine skiing battle for the women's overall World Cup title on Friday.</p>
<p>Sweden's Wiberg boosted her confidence last weekend by clinching her second victory of the season in a slalom in Semmering, to snatch the lead in the overall standings from absent title-holder Seizinger.</p>
<p>Wiberg, who has 612 points to the German's 494, likes the technical events and will be more comfortable in Friday's giant slalom and Saturday's slalom than speed specialist Seizinger will.</p>
<p>Seizinger, who has never stood on a World Cup slalom podium, opted to miss the back-to-back slaloms at Semmering to train instead in her favourite speed disciplines.</p>
<p>Seizinger, the 1993 super-G world and 1994 Olympic downhill champion, was also weakend by a bout of influenza in December which forced her to pull out of a slalom in Crans Montana, Switzerland.</p>
<p>At the new year's opening races in Slovenia's second largest city, Wiberg could easily collect more points than Seizinger in the slalom while the door remains wide open in the giant slalom.</p>
<p>Although Wiberg is a 1991 world and 1992 Olympic giant slalom champion, she has had only one World Cup victory in this discipline, six years ago.</p>
<p>Seizinger, who has celebrated the majority of her wins in downhill and super-G, has been on top of the World Cup giant slalom podium four times -- including at last year's edition of the Maribor race.</p>
<p>This winter, Seizinger has made the rostrum at both giant slalom races so far with a victory in Soelden and a third place behind Italy's Sabina Panzanini and Austria's Anita Wachter in Park City, Utah.</p>
<p>But Wiberg, who has her sights firmly set on winning her first overall trophy this winter, is optimistic after having celebrated the New Year in Vienna.</p>
<p>"I'm looking forward to the races in Maribor although I will always have mixed feelings towards this slope" said the 26-year-old Swede, who won the season's first super-G in Lake Louise, Canada.</p>
<p>Wiberg had to miss the 1993 world championships after her Achilles tendon snapped halfway down the giant slalom piste in Maribor. Her best results here were second and third places in slalom in 1994 and 1992 respectively.</p>
<p>Tough competition will without doubt be provided by Italian Deborah Compagnoni, whose triumphant returns to the elite of ski racing following serious injury and illness are already legendary.</p>
<p>"Debbie" demonstrated her current strength by recording her maiden slalom win in the second race staged in Semmering. It marked Italy's first slalom victory since Paoletta Magoni won in Pfronten, Germany, in 1985.</p>
<p>The reigning Olympic and world giant slalom champion -- who also took super-G gold at the 1992 Games -- has made the podium twice more this season, with second places in Soelden and Semmering.</p>
<p>"I like the slope in Maribor and have a good feeling for the races because I'm in very good shape. It would be nice to win here once," she said.</p>
<p>Last year, Compagnoni made her comeback to the circuit in Maribor after missing the first half of the season due to a knee injury and immediately impressed with a second place in the giant slalom.</p>
