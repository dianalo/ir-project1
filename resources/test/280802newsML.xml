<p>One of San Francisco's streetcars derailed Sunday, striking five cars and slightly injuring three people, officials said.</p>
<p>The streetcar was being towed Sunday morning to a nearby garage for repairs when it suddenly came loose. It slid down a hill, derailed and then slammed into parked cars at the bottom, San Francisco Municipal Railway spokesman Alan Siegel said.</p>
<p>The streetcar's operator and two people in a car were injured in the accident, he said. Paramedics took them to a local hospital for treatment of minor injuries. It was not carrying passengers at the time.</p>
<p>The streetcar, similar to a bus but which runs on rails, was not one of the city's famed cable cars.</p>
