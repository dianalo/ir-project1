<p>Only one in three Britons see their monarchy surviving beyond the year 2050, according to an opinion poll on the scandal-scarred royal family.</p>
<p>The Mori Poll, cited by the Sunday Times, showed that just 33 percent believed the 1,000-year-old monarchy would keep going for more than another generation.</p>
<p>When asked to list three things they felt the royal family contributed to British society, 23 percent could not think of anything.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth has sought to placate increasingly hostile Britons by agreeing to pay income tax and opening up Buckingham Palace to tourists to finance restoration work on the fire-ravaged Windsor Castle.</p>
<p>But her efforts have been overwhelmed by scandals involving her children and the divorces last year of her two eldest sons, Prince Charles and Prince Andrew.  REUTER</p>
