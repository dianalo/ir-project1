<p>LONDON, Oct 31 (LPC) - Banks are currently mulling commitments to the $2.5 billion aircraft financing for British Airways ahead of next week's scheduled close, bankers said.</p>
<p>In general syndication, banks are being offered a top-end fee of 17.5 bps for commitments of $100 million. The margin is dependent on the length of the Japanese Leveraged Leases (JLL's) used for individual airplane purchases. For credits of 12 years the margin is 30 bps over LIBOR unless more than 80 per cent of the loan is drawn, in which case the margin steps up to 35 bps. On 15 year credits the margin is 35 bps over LIBOR.</p>
<p>The deal is being led by arrangers Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi; Fuji Bank; Industrial Bank of Japan; Natwest Markets and Mitsubishi Trust &amp; Banking Corp. Seven banks -- ABN AMRO Bank, Citibank, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, HSBC Investment Bank, Royal Bank of Canada, Sanwa Bank and Sumitomo Bank -- joined the deal as lead underwriters prior to general syndication.</p>
