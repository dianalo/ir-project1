<headline>Dollar catches bond/stock updraft in U.S.</headline>

<p>The dollar closed higher across the board on Friday, aided by accumulating evidence of U.S. economic strength and the renewed ascent of U.S. financial markets after several days of turbulence.</p>
<p>The dollar shook off Thursday's turn-of-the-year malaise, rising against most major currencies, in the process setting a new 45-month high against the yen and a two-and-a-half-year high against Swiss franc.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark put in one of its best one day performances since late 1995, according to analysts, surging to a high of 1.5681 and ending at 1.5655/65, up from 1.5520/25 at the open.</p>
<p>Slumping U.S. assets derailed the dollar's last 1996 upswing on New Year's eve and stifled it again when trading for the new year commenced on Thursday.</p>
<p>But the impressive performance of Wall Street stocks, which gained more than 100 points on Friday, was an important green light for traders.</p>
<p>"The market was a little bit negative on the dollar, based on the risk to the downside on stocks," said John Barlow, senior dealer at Bayerishe Landesbank Girozentrale, in New York. "But you had a feeling that all the strong economic data was going to mean something else."</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 116.70 yen, its highest since April 1993, closing at 116.28/38, up from 116.04/09 at the open. It reached a high of 1.3633 Swiss francs before settling at 1.3590/00, still above its starting price of 1.3520/30.</p>
<p>The U.S. bond market was also up for most of the day, despite additional data on Friday suggesting robust economic activity could lead to higher U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>The U.S. government report on construction spending, which increased 1.9 percent in November, came after surprisingly robust manufacturing data and growing consumer confidence, which jolted the bond market and sent yields higher Thursday.</p>
<p>But early on Friday, sturdier bond prices gave traders another thumbs-up to buy dollars.</p>
<p>"Everyone was jumping on the bandwagon, it wasn't just any one particular customer," said Kisoo Park, senior dealer at Bank of Boston.</p>
<p>Foreign investors were said to be particularly eager to buy dollars, finding investment returns in other currencies relatively unappetizing.</p>
<p>The dollar rose above 116.40, its 1996 high set on December 31, as speculation mounted that upon their return from an extended holiday break on Monday, the Japanese could be eager buyers of U.S. Treasury securities, the yields of which reached thier highest since late October on Thursday.</p>
<p>In 1996 a strong U.S. economy and high interest rates sucked investor capital out of Japan, which propelled the dollar 12 percent higher against the yen for the year.</p>
<p>"It's dollar-financial-asset love here," said Alfonso Alejo, corporate foreign exchange manager at Sakura Bank in New York.</p>
<p>"It's foreigners buying dollars to buy those assets and the Japanese may be among them and they don't have to wait until Monday," he added.</p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar fell to Canadian $1.3698/03 from C$1.3751/56 at the open. The pound fell to $1.6872/82 from $1.6940/47. The Australian dollar fell to $0.7898/03 from $0.7931/36.</p>
