<p>Swiss cement producer Holderbank Financiere Glarus AG said it expected its 1996 results to show a shortfall compared with 1995 results, but that the drop should be kept within limits.</p>
<p>Chairman Thomas Schmidheiny said in a letter to shareholders that setbacks caused by adverse weather would not be fully offset by the end of the year.</p>
<p>"However, thanks to a solid performance in North and Latin America, the shortfall against last year's results should be kept within limits," Schmidheiny wrote.</p>
<p>Holderbank reported a 1995 group net profit of 629 million Swiss francs for 1995, on group net sales of 8.27 billion francs.  </p>
<p>Schmidheiny said recession in Europe had been compounded by an unexpectedly harsh winter throughout much of the continent at the start of this year.</p>
<p>"Holderbank could not avoid being affected by this adverse trend and the financial performance in the first half of 1996 was weaker than expected," he wrote in the interim report to shareholders.</p>
<p>Holderbank said its consolidated net income after taxes fell by 7.5 percent, or 23 million Swiss francs, to 283 million in the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>Consolidated net turnover rose 13.8 percent, or 543 million Swiss francs, to 4.481 billion. Changes due to its scope of consolidation generated 567 million Swiss francs, along with 18 million gained on currency translation effects. Concurrently, price and volume fluctuations reduced turnover by 42 million.</p>
<p>Schmidheiny said setbacks suffered by the majority of European units due to bad weather were hardly likely to be made good by the end of this year.</p>
<p>"Europe's contribution to the 1996 consolidated results is thus expected to be a disappointing one, falling short of budget expectations," he said.</p>
<p>In contrast, group region North America presented an attractive picture, Schmidheiny said.</p>
<p>"The signs are looking good for the second half as well," he said about North American operations.</p>
<p>Schmidheiny said Latin America was also a positive region.</p>
<p>"Poised for a solid financial performance over the year as a whole, Latin America will, along with North America, once again be a mainstay of the group as whole in 1996," he said.</p>
