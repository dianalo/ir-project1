<title>UK: IPE gas oil ends listless day steady, Brent drops.</title>
<headline>IPE gas oil ends listless day steady, Brent drops.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-02</dateline>

<p>IPE April gas oil closed on Wednesday unchanged on the day after low volume trading in a $2 range.</p>
<p>The prompt April contract closed steady at $165.50 a tonne and the May was also unchanged on the day at $167.50. Further forward contracts lost between 25 cents and $1.25 a tonne.</p>
<p>"It's been deadly quiet and there is really nothing to say. Gas oil is suffering because the arbitrage (against NYMEX) is only open for about one and a half hours so the volume is very slack," one analyst said.</p>
<p>Europe has moved over to summer time a week ahead of the U.S. and so the NYMEX markets open at 1545 British time and close an hour after the IPE.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, May Brent crude oil lost some 19 cents to trade at $18.92 a barrel by 1640 GMT. Most brokers expected the contract to break below support at $18.83 a barrel and some expected current weak fundamentals to pull crude down by another dollar in the medium term.</p>
<p>"We may have another leg down and it would not surprise me if (crude) prices came off another dollar when you look at fundamentals," one broker said.</p>
<p>A fundamentally weak market has led to trade such as the Brent deal seen done on Wednesday at a 97-cent discount to May Brent in the cash market.</p>
