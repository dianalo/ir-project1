<headline>Dollar gains on rate hopes, Bundesbank comments.</headline>

<p>NEW YORK, March 13 - The dollar climbed Thursday amid increased expectations of higher U.S. interest rates and on a news report that a senior German central bank official did not object to recent dollar gains against the mark.</p>
<p>But a sharp sell-off in the prices of Treasury securities and stocks caused the dollar to trim its gains.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department reported that sales by retail stores rose briskly in February after the strongest increase in nearly a year during January.</p>
<p>The sales indicate the economy was growing at a robust pace in the first quarter of this year, prompting traders to wonder whether the Federal Reserve would need to hike short-term interest rates to keep the economy from overheating.</p>
<p>Fed policymakers meet on March 25. The central bank has not raised short-term interest rates in more than two years.</p>
<p>Higher interest rates help the dollar by making dollar-denominated deposits more attractive to foreign investors.</p>
<p>"I think the feeling ... that there's more chance for a rate rise in March unsettled the market a little bit. And we saw bonds come off and a rise in the value of the dollar," said Stephen Jury, chief dealer at Union Bank of Switzerland.</p>
<p>The dollar rose above 123 Japanese yen for the first time in nearly three weeks. Traders who had sold dollars rushed to buy them back. As the dollar rallied, it also triggered previously set orders to buy, hastening the currency's rise.</p>
<p>In late trade on Thursday, the dollar fetched 123.34 yen, up from 122.27 yen on Wednesday. The dollar climbed to 1.7047 German marks from 1.6928 marks.</p>
<p>The dollar climbed to 1.4650 Swiss francs from 1.4550 francs and to Canadian $1.3650 from C$1.3631. The British pound fell to $1.5973 from $1.5987.</p>
<p>The dollar got another shot in the arm after a report by Bridge News that Bundesbank council member Helmut Hesse said there was no reason for the Bundesbank to take action on the stronger dollar.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, the dollar has risen nearly 12 percent vs. the mark.</p>
<p>"We were right below some triggers, and as soon as he spoke in thin markets, people bought (dollars)... So, off we went," said Kevin Harris, an international economist at MCM CurrencyWatch.</p>
<p>He attributed dollar gains partly to a "short squeeze".</p>
<p>Short positions occur when traders sell borrowed dollars with the intention of buying them back later at lower prices and so make a profit. Because the dollar began to rise instead of fall, these traders had to cover their short positions by buying back dollars in order to limit their losses.</p>
<p>Late in the day, the rally in the dollar paused when the price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell a full point, and the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 2 percent.</p>
<p>In late trading, the 30-year bond was down 29/32, or $9.6 per $1,000 face value, sending its yield up to 6.96 percent from 6.88 percent. The Dow ended down 160.48 points, or 2.28 percent at 6,878.89.</p>
<p>Higher interest rates typically hurt stocks by drawing investments away from equity markets.</p>
<p>"Obviously the sell-off in the stocks and bonds are weighing on the dollar, but there has been some very good interest to buy dollars today," said John McCarthy, senior vice president of foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets.</p>
<p>"For the dollar to put in a strong performance like today in the face of a weaker stock and bond market is pretty impressive," he said.</p>
