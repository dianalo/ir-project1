<title>UK: IPE oil futures slightly off in low volume.</title>
<headline>IPE oil futures slightly off in low volume.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>IPE Brent crude and gas oil futures continued little changed on Thursday in low volume trade, with the market likely to hold within a tight range, brokers said.</p>
<p>By 1146 GMT September Brent was down five cents at $18.34 a barrel, with gas oil unchanged on the day at $165 a tonne.</p>
<p>The market would be keeping an eye out for any move higher by U.S crude during the London afternoon. NYMEX September crude is tipped by some technical analysts to make an upside break towards the psychological $20 a barrel mark.  </p>
<p>NYMEX crude on ACCESS was last done at $19.68 a barrel, five cents above the NYMEX settle at $19.63.</p>
<p>"If Brent can clear $18.50, $18.70/80 will be next," GNI Research said in a report. "But we are constantly wary of a potential breakdown if resistance levels remain in place."</p>
<p>News of the timing of the resumption of Iraq's oil-sale deal remained on the back-burner.</p>
<p>Iraq needs to sell 1.5 million barrels of crude per day in order to raise the $1 billion it needs to buy humanitarian aid before a six-month deal ends in September.</p>
