<p>German call money was trading slightly lower at around 3.05 percent on Wednesday after the Bundesbank more than completely offset its expiring securities repurchase tender in this week's allotment.</p>
<p>The central bank alloted 74.2 billion marks in this week's repo, replacing an expiring 74 billion marks of funds.</p>
<p>Dealers said that the market was generally quiet, with no speculation of any credit policy moves by the Bundesbank this Thursday. Economists mostly expect no interest rate moves on Thursday, although there is a growing sense that the repo rate could be lowered again later in 1997 to kickstart the economy.  </p>
<p>Banks held a comfortable 41.8 billion marks in reserves with the central bank on Tuesday, Bundesbank data showed, up from 40.4 billion on Monday.</p>
<p>The average for the first 21 days of the month was 40.1 billion marks, up from 40 billion for the first 20 days.</p>
<p>Banks took up 100 million marks at the Lombard rate on Tuesday, down from 300 million on Monday.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt Interbank Overnight Average  FIONA= was calculated at 3.10058 percent compared with 3.10333 percent on Tuesday.</p>
