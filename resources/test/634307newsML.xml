<p>Italian utility Enel and Houston-based Enron Corp., two of the world's biggest power companies, have agreed to create a joint independent company to take advantage of the planned liberalisation of the European electricity market.</p>
<p>Enron confirmed in a statement Tuesday that its Enron Europe Ltd. subsidiary and L'Ente Nazionale per L'Energia Elettrica, which is known as Enel, signed a non-binding letter of intent to form a 50-50 joint venture company.</p>
<p>The new company would own up to 5,000 megawatts of power plants currently owned by the Italian utility, with Enron expected to serve as fuel manager for the venture, Enron said in a statement.</p>
<p>Italian industrial sources said the joint venture would be worth about $3 billion.</p>
<p>The planned deal marks the second time in a month that Enel has decided to dispose of a chunk its existing 55,000-megawatt power network in preparation for the opening of the Italian electricity distribution market in 1999.</p>
<p>With over 650,000 miles of transmission lines, Enel is the world's second-largest electric utility in terms of installed power and number of customers. It has 90,600 employees.</p>
<p>The brief Enron annnouncement confirming the deal did not provide financial arrangements or other details of the joint venture.</p>
<p>Sources in Italy said that state-owned Enel would provide all the generating power for the Enron venture and would place around $2.4 billion of its debt in the company.</p>
<p>The European unit of Enron, one of the world's largest natural gas and electricity groups, will inject cash into the project, the sources said.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that Enron and Enel would each contribute $300 million of equity in the venture.</p>
<p>Last month, Enel announced it was linking up with Italian energy group Eni to create an electricity production company with a capacity similar to the Enron initiative.</p>
<p>The firm will eventually be floated on international stock exchanges and Enel Chairman Chicco Testa said last week that General Electric Co. had expressed an interest in buying a stake in the group.</p>
<p>The Eni-Enel deal infuriated Italy's small independent electricity production sector, with private companies complaining that the two state-controlled groups were looking to take a stranglehold on the liberalised market.</p>
<p>Enel currently enjoys a monopoly over domestic distribution, but about 30 percent of the market will be opened to independent companies following European Union demands that the Italian electricity sector be freed up.</p>
<p>"The philosophy behind the ventures is for Enel to be able to compete in the liberalised market," an industry source said.</p>
<p>Enel, which recently announced record profits of 1.27 trillion lire ($747 million) for 1996, was due to be privatised by the end of the year. But an initial stock offering has been postponed, with the government undecided how to sell the company.</p>
