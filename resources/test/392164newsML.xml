<p>- With 131 days to go before the British colony reverts to China, editorials in the Hong Kong media concentrated on the death of Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>-- HONG KONG ECONOMIC TIMES said the death of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping had not come as a surprise or shock. It said that Deng would be remembered both for his contribution in starting the economic reforms and open-door policy, and his mistake in handling the Tiananmen crackdown in 1989.</p>
<p>-- SING TAO DAILY said the death of Deng represented the end of an era and the beginning of a new period. It said China's political stability and basic policies would not be affected by his death, because Deng had made sure that the position of the new generation of leaders was secure.</p>
<p>-- HONG KONG DAILY NEWS said Deng changed the history of China and the fate of Hong Kong people. He was not only an outstanding politician, but also a brilliant military strategist. It said Hong Kong people believed that the third generation of Chinese leaders would carry on Deng's course, and that the "one country two systems" policy on Hong Kong would not change.</p>
