<headline>Mobil, British Gas revise North Sea pact.</headline>

<p>British Gas PLC and Mobil North Sea Ltd said Monday that they had renegotiated their North Sea gas contracts.  </p>
<p>The companies said they renegotiated their "take or pay" North Sea gas contracts, thus reducing the natural gas volumes which British Gas will be under contract to buy from Mobil.</p>
<p>Under the new terms, Centrica, the gas sales and production unit to be formed through British Gas' planned demerger, will end two contracts with Mobil and cut prices on three other contracts to market levels, the companies said.</p>
<p>In turn, British Gas will transfer Beryl Field producing and transportation assets to Mobil. These assets give Mobil 27 million more barrels of oil and gas reserves and increased daily oil and gas production of about 9,000 barrels, the companies said.  </p>
<p>British Gas will transfer to Mobil North Sea Limited producing and transportation assets in and around the Beryl Field, they said. These assets comprise a five percent interest in the Beryl Field, 29.5 percent of Block 9/12a in the Nevis Field and 2.5 percent of the Scottish Area Gas Evacuation system, the companies said.</p>
<p>These assets will provide Mobil with an additional 27 million barrels of oil equivalent in reserves and increased daily oil and gas production of approximately 9,000 barrels of oil equivalent.</p>
<p>Centrica will be the new publicly limited company to be created by the proposed demerger of British Gas which will take place in February 1997. With 19 million customers, Centrica will be a major provider of energy and energy-related services in Great Britian.</p>
