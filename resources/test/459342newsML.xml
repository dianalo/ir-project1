<p>Blue-chip stocks ended lower Friday on concern the strong dollar would hurt the overseas sales of corporate giants such as International Business Machines Corp. and Eastman Kodak Co.</p>
<p>Investors were also biding their time before a Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday that could bring higher interest rates.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average closed 15.49 points lower at 6,804.79. For the week, it lost 130.67 points.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,241 to 1,154 on active volume of 534 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Wall Streeters worried the strong dollar was eroding the profit picture of multinationals, and they focused on Eastman Kodak, which tumbled 9-1/4 to 79 and IBM, off 4-3/8 to 132-1/2, in consolidated trading.</p>
<p>Tobacco shares were also weak, extending their recent slide on the tobacco suit story. Philip Morris Cos. fell 4-3/8 to 111-1/2 and Loews Corp. slid 5-1/8 to 93-3/8.</p>
<p>Beyond the focus on a handful of stocks, however, activity was surprisingly muted given that the quarterly "triple witching" expiration of options, index options and index futures took place.</p>
<p>The quiet tone in the market highlighted a furious sell-off in Kodak, the NYSE's most active issue with more than 11 million shares changing hands.</p>
<p>Kodak warned its sales for the first two months of the year were flat vs. a year earlier, putting part of the blame on the dollar.</p>
<p>Two Wall Street brokerage houses trimmed their earnings estimates on IBM, again citing the dollar.</p>
<p>For some time, analysts have cautioned that multinationals would begin to suffer from the strong currency. With concrete evidence now emerging, they said the concerns could become more widespread.</p>
<p>"Often this starts with somebody signalling to the investment community that there may be a problem," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp. "Then, it starts to become less specific."</p>
<p>"A lot of companies tell us they have adequately hedged for currency swings, but when you see a sophisticated company like Kodak get hit, you start to wonder," he added.</p>
<p>Kodak's sharp fall dragged the Dow index to its fourth straight loss, a fall that widened the average's slump to 131 points for the week.</p>
<p>Technology stocks edged lower, despite holding to positive ground for most of the session.</p>
<p>Analysts continue to watch the tech stocks for signs of an end to  their two-month retreat but warned any recovery would likely take a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>"When a group gets whacked like this and then starts to find a bottom, it doesn't typically come roaring back right away," said Larry Wachtel, an analyst at Prudential Securities. "There has to be a convalescent period."</p>
<p>Among special situations, generic drug maker IVAX Corp. fell 1-5/8 to 10-3/4 on the American Stock Exchange after drug wholesaler Bergen Brunswig Corp. called off their merger. Bergen Brunswig rose 1/8 to 31-5/8 on the NYSE.</p>
<p>Outback Steakhouse Inc. lost 4-5/8 to 19 on Nasdaq after warning its first-quarter earnings would not meet Wall Street estimates.</p>
<p>Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. slumped 2-3/4 to 38-1/2 on the NYSE as uncertainty mounted over a federal probe of the company's El Paso, Texas operations. Columbia said it has not been told of the allegations underlying the investigation.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index fell 5.19 points to 1,254.07.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 1.45 to 784.10. The American Stock Exchange index was off 0.33 at 591.22.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 1.02 to 412.80. The average share was up 11 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 7,468.073, up 14.222 or 0.19 percent.</p>
