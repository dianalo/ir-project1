<text>
<p>Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten vacated his official residence, Government House, on Monday, symbolising the beginning of the end of British colonial rule.  </p>
<p>Patten, choking back emotion, stood silently in steady rain on a raised wooden platform as a honour guard of British army Chinese troops paid tribute with a ceremonial march past.</p>
<p>Bagpipes skirled as Patten then said his last farewells to Chinese and British staff members, many of them with tears in their eyes. Patten's wife Lavender and his three daughters looked on.</p>
<p>A lone bugler struck up the "Last Post" as a guard lowered the Union Jack flag from a pole. Large crowds gathered outside the grounds of Government House waved goodbye as Patten and his family were driven out to the strains of "Auld Lang Syne".</p>
<p>The curtain falls on 156 years of British rule in Hong Kong at midnight (1600 GMT) on Monday when the the territory is handed back to China.</p>
