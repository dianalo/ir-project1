<p>Spain's social security budget had an extra deficit of 35 billion pesetas in the first quarter of 1997 due to higher than expected payouts for temporary incapacity of workers, a Labour Ministry official told Reuters.</p>
<p>"Some measures, which had been already approved to keep these kind of expenditures under control, will have a delayed effect," the official said on Friday.</p>
<p>According to the 1997 budget law, total expenditure for temporary incapacity payments is 480.8 billion pesetas, or six percent of the total expenditures of the social security system.</p>
<p>Spanish financial newspaper La Gaceta de Negocios reported on Friday the extra deficit was due to fraudulent behaviour of people claiming state subsidies.</p>
<p>Spain's public administration aimed to reduce its total deficit to three percent of the gross domestic product this year from 4.4 percent in 1996, as required by the criteria to enter the European economic and monetary union.</p>
