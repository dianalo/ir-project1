<p>URS Corp. will acquire privately owned Woodward-Clyde Group Inc. for $100 million in stock and cash, creating one of the biggest engineering firms in the United States, the companies said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The deal calls for Denver-based Woodward-Clyde shareholders to receive $65 million in URS common stock plus $35 million in cash, the companies said in a statement.</p>
<p>The companies said the proposed merger will create the fifth largest U.S. engineering firm, with revenues of approximately $800 million and more than 6,000 employees.</p>
<p>Following the announcement, URS stock surged $1.50, or 11 percent, to $15.125 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was among the biggest percentage gainers.</p>
<p>The acquisition, slated to close in November, is not expected to have a material impact on URS fiscal 1998 earnings, they said.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to approval by stockholders of both companies as well as regulatory and other approvals, they said.</p>
<p>"Domestically, the combination balances the geographic distribution of resources to create a dynamic national firm with the ability to provide a full range of services anywhere in the country," URS Chairman Martin Koffel said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Our combined revenue base will escalate URS into one of the leading engineering firms and further enhance our opportunities to win large, high-profile contracts," he said.</p>
<p>The companies said they expect Woodward-Clyde President and CEO Jean-Yves Perez and Chairman Frank Waller to join the URS board.</p>
<p>URS, based in San Francisco, specializes in environmental, infrastructure and construction projects and operates 35 offices nationwide. Woodward-Clyde serves clients in the chemical, oil, pharmaceutical, mining and forest products industries, among others, and has 84 offices worldwide.</p>
