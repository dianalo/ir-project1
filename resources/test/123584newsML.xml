<headline>Egyptian shares at two-month low.</headline>

<p>Egyptian shares fell to a two-month low on Thursday in trade plagued again by delays in the dealing and clearing systems, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Capital Market Authority (CMA) all-share index slipped 0.44 points to close at 232.68, its lowest level since August 19. But turnover picked up to 21.86 million pounds ($6.4 million), more than for any other day in two weeks.</p>
<p>Stock data on Reuter screens has been misleading since Tuesday because of unilateral changes made to the coding system at the exchange. This should be resolved by next week.</p>
<p>Banks joined flour mills among the most active stocks but there was no common direction in the financial sector.</p>
<p>National Societe Generale Bank, the first joint-venture bank to go majority foreign-owned, jumped 28.00 pounds to close at 508.00. "Investors are taking it more seriously now that Societe Generale has increased its stake," said Neveen El Tahri of Delta EAB stockbrokers.</p>
<p>But blue-chip Commercial International Bank fell back 20.00 to end at 440.00 pounds. "There's no good reason to explain that drop," added Tahri.</p>
<p>The most active flour mills were down or unchanged across the board -- Upper Egypt Flour Mills dropped 0.90 to 45.15, Central, East Delta Flour Mills by 0.50 to 35.60 and North Cairo Flour Mills by 2.00 to 107.00.</p>
<p>West Delta Flour Mills was unchanged at 51.00.</p>
<p>The CMA index for openly traded firms fell 2.02 points to 352.55 points, another one-month low, while the index for rarely traded "closed" firms rose to 162.94 from 162.88 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Declines outnumbered advances by 29 to 12.</p>
