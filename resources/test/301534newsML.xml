<p>Roman Catholic bishops in the Central African Republic urged the nation on Sunday to set aside ethnic hatred to avoid the danger that an army mutiny will explode into all-out civil war.</p>
<p>In a message read at the main mass in the red-brick cathedral in the former French colony's capital Bangui, they urged politicians and soldiers to opt for reconciliation and dialogue.</p>
<p>With French troops ensuring security in flash points in the city, African mediators held parallel talks with the mutineers and with representatives of rival political parties and society at large in a bid to launch a dialogue and find common ground.</p>
<p>"Our country is experiencing the worst crisis in its history," Monsignor Paulin Pomodimo, bishop of Bossangoa, told more than 2,000 worshippers gathered into the cathedral.</p>
<p>"The conflict has taken on ethnic overtones," he said. "Tribal violence has touched us in the neighbourhoods where people live with a rare cruelty."</p>
<p>The mutinies began in April over pay but turned into a campaign to oust President Ange-Felix Patasse, a civilian elected in 1993.</p>
<p>The crisis, which has killed hundreds of people, flared anew on November 15 when a section of the army mutinied again. A fragile truce runs out on January 23.</p>
<p>Pomodimo said the division of the army had brought with it the spectre of civil war in the country, where a third of the 3.4 million people are Christians, half of those Catholics.</p>
<p>He said bishops found it "inadmissable" that soldiers should hold the country hostage and called for implementation of measures agreed by a national conference to end a second mutiny in May. These measures called for reorganisation of the army with a greater role in the development of the nation.</p>
<p>Mali's widely respected former military leader, Amadou Toumani Toure, and his mediating team have set up a multi-party conciliation committee. Sources close to the talks say the aim is to produce a blueprint for lasting peace by Wednesday.</p>
<p>At the same time, the mediators, representing four African heads of state mandated by a Franco-African summit in December, are negotiating with the mutineers in an effort to bring them into the dialogue.</p>
<p>Toumani Toure, widely respected for the way he ushered in democracy in Mali, says the mediators are here to help but it is up to Central Africans themselves to agree a solution.</p>
<p>He says the military problem cannot be addressed in isolation from the political problem.</p>
<p>French troops, in the country under a defence pact, control key intersections in the capital's volatile southern suburbs, from which they ejected the mutineers after the January 4 killing of two French officers on a mediation mission.</p>
<p>Life has resumed the trappings of normality, with markets open and taxis and residents circulating in what were no-go areas but tension remains with presidential loyalists checking vehicles in the centre of the city.</p>
<p>The mutineers, who are from the minority Yakoma tribe of former military leader Andre Kolingba, number about 750 but scattered after losing men and territory in January 5 French retaliatory raids. They want to regroup at pre-agreed points.</p>
