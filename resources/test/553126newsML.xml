<p>Top seed Yevegeny Kafelnikov crashed out of the $365,000 Czech Open men's ATP tennis tournament on Thursday, losing in straight sets to unseeded German qualifier Marcello Craca 7-6 6-4.</p>
<p>Second seed Marcelo Rios continued his recent run of form, cruising past France's Stephan Simian 6-4 6-2 in another second round match, while Fabrice Santoro was the first to reach the semifinals, taking out Brazil's Gustavo Kurten 7-6 3-6 6-1.</p>
<p>In each set Kafelnikov, the returning champion and world number four, started well with early breaks but failed to capitalise and was undone by a slew of unforced errors that allowed Craca back into the match.</p>
<p>It was the the third consecutive week the 23-year-old Russian has lost in an early round of an ATP event.</p>
<p>"I had the first set under control, but somehow I just lost it," last year's French Open champion said afterwards.</p>
<p>Chilean Rios, coming off his biggest tournament win at the Monte Carlo Open last week, had little trouble dispatching Kurten in 68 minutes.</p>
<p>"Overall, I am happy with my play today, I really didn't make many errors. It was our first meeting so I didn't really know what to expect," Rios said.</p>
