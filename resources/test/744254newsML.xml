<p>Malaysia said on Monday it had set up a task force to assess the impact of the "millennium bug" on the country's computer systems.</p>
<p>"Because of the wide impact of the millennium bug, the task force has rightly decided to target their efforts at spurring management to action to meet the challenge, so that this should not be viewed merely as a technical problem," said Tengku Mohamed Azzman Shariffadeen, permanent secretary to the National Information Technology Council (NITC) in a statement.</p>
<p>The statement said the task force was set up on April 24 and held its first meeting earlier on Monday.</p>
<p>The millennium bug stems from computer systems using two digits to show the year, which programmers originally used to save scarce processing capacity.</p>
<p>At the turn of the century, many computers will show 00 for the year and interpret it as 1900, potentially causing havoc. Companies and governments are now racing to reprogram old software.</p>
<p>The NITC is a quasi-government department under Malaysia's first Internet service provider MIMOS Bhd.</p>
<p>No estimates were available as to the impact of the millennium bug on the Malaysian economy if it was not dealt with effectively, Omar Abdul Rahman, one of two joint chairmen of the task force, told a news conference after the meeting.</p>
<p>The group, comprising representatives from most major industry groupings in the country, have been given a November deadline by the NITC to present such estimates, said Omar.</p>
<p>"The task force was set up by the Prime Minister (Mahathir Mohamad) himself, when he recognised the importance of the issue," said Omar.</p>
