<p>The new chief of Spain's securities exchange watchdog told journalists on Friday he planned to tighten control of mutual fund investments in non-quoted shares and derivatives.</p>
<p>"Derivatives can be used to reduce risk, but when funds invest in derivatives, it's a very volatile and high risk area," Juan Fernandez-Armesto, new president of the National Stock Market Commission (CNMV), said. "We'll all our attention on ensuring there are no problems with such a sensitive market."</p>
<p>He said the problem with non-quoted shares was there was no market to provide safety-net liquidity to investors, but it was a question of timing more than anything else.</p>
<p>Fernandez-Armesto, who took control on Friday along with CNMV Vice President Luis Ramallo, said his first task would be to adapt market law to conform with European Union directives, using suggestions solicited from each of the securities markets.</p>
<p>He said the two main areas of reform would be technical aspects of the system of sanctions as well as the mutual funds.</p>
<p>The new president said he planned to guide the CNMV along four main principles: flexibility, innovation, acceptance of responsibilities and protection of the investor.</p>
