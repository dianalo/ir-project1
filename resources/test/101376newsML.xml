<p>After a lightning stop here to boost Middle East peace talks, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Monday begins his first trip to sub-Saharan Africa with a visit to Mali, where he aims to praise democratic gains.</p>
<p>In Mali and four other countries on his itinerary, he will also press U.S. plans to replace U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, urging African leaders to propose alternative candidates, U.S. officials said.</p>
<p>Christopher is the first U.S. secretary of state to visit sub-Saharan Africa in more than six years and the first to stop in Mali, a West African country of 9.4 million people with an annual per capita income of $250,</p>
<p>U.S.-Mali bilateral relations have been good since Mali gained independence in 1960 but strengthened after the first democratically-elected civilian government was installed in 1992.</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary of State George Moose, who specialises in African affairs, said Christopher will "showcase the significant contribution, progress, that Mali has been making in terms of both democratic reform and economic reform".</p>
<p>In addition, Christopher will highlight Mali's "commitment to reconciliation at home and its contribution to regional peacekeeping and stability throughout the sub-region and the region", Moose told reporters.</p>
<p>Christopher is due to arrive late in the afternoon in the Malian capital of Bamako and holds talks on Tuesday with Malian President Alpha Oumar Konare. A meeting is planned with private voluntary organisations and Malian parlimentarians.</p>
<p>Christopher is due to visit a U.S. Peace Corps water sanitation and tree planting project. Mali is the site of the Peace Corps' largest Africa mission, involving more than 200 people.</p>
<p>Soon after he took office in 1993, Christopher promised that the Clinton administration would make Africa a high priority and give it the attention it deserves.</p>
<p>Officials say Christopher has been unable to get to sub-Saharan Africa until now because of the pressure of other business, including Bosnia and Middle East peace negotiations.</p>
<p>But the timing of the visit just weeks ahead of the November 5 U.S. presidential election could give President Bill Clinton -- already running ahead of Republican challenger Bob Dole in public opinion polls -- an extra boost among Afro-American voters.</p>
<p>Other senior U.S. officials have been to sub-Saharan Africa in recent years, however, including National Security Adviser Anthony Lake and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.</p>
<p>Christopher and the administration have maintained that the United States is committed to engagement in Africa despite budget problems which has caused U.S. aid to shrink in recent years.</p>
<p>In addition to Mali, Christopher will visit Ethiopia, Tanzania, South Africa and Angola.</p>
<p>In Angola, he plans to see President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Jonas Savimbi, leader of the former rebel group UNITA, to encourage both sides to adhere to a peace agreement. But U.S. officials said they were having trouble arranging the Savimbi meeting because the former U.S. ally did not want to come to the capital Luanda, where he feels threatened.</p>
<p>Christopher is due to return to Washington on October 14 or 15.</p>
