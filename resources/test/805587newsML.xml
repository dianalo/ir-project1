<p>Singapore gas oil swaps dipped slightly late afternoon on Monday due to a selloff in the West which dampened sentiment, traders said.</p>
<p>"Gas oil is down slightly this afternoon because of the selloff in the West. Nothing has changed over here," one trader said.</p>
<p>September gas oil was last quoted down five cents from this morning at $23.15/$23.25 per barrel, brokers said. It traded earlier in the day at $23.15, they said.  </p>
<p>In the west, October Brent last traded down 17 cents to $18.82 per barrel with September gas oil down $2.25 per tonne to $169.00 on the International Petroleum Exchange in London.</p>
<p>The September/October spread traded earlier in the day at minus 74 and 75 cents which is about five cents below its Friday's value.</p>
<p>Despite the slight narrowing of the contango, it is still steep enough to make it worthwhile for oil companies to store their gas oil and jet fuel for winter.</p>
<p>But it had at the same time forced some companies to sell at big discounts in order to make room for fresh cargoes.  </p>
<p>In the physical market, one 150,000-barrel cargo for September 2-6 lifting traded at $22.40 per barrel, free-on-board basis, down 10 cents from last Monday's traded level.</p>
<p>Jet fuel is also under pressure with the September regrade slipping to trade on Friday at 80 cents, lower than Thursday's $0.90/$1.10, brokers said.</p>
<p>September regrade was last quoted at 70-90 cents, they said.</p>
<p>Outright September Kerosene traded earlier in the day at $24.00 per barrel, which still yields an implied 80-cent regrade value, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Physical jet fuel traded on Friday at $22.80 per barrel free-on-board Singapore basis.</p>
<p>Singapore fuel oil swaps were steady despite the selloff in the west as the market looked to physical buying interest later in the day.</p>
<p>September fuel oil swaps were last quoted 25 cents higher from Friday at $103.75/$104.50 per tonne with October up 50 cents at $104.25/$105.00, brokers said.</p>
<p>September traded earlier in the day at $104.00 and October at $104.50, they said.</p>
