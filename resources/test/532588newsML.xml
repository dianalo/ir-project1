<p>Spain's debt market ended higher on Wednesday drawing support from the European commission forecast saying that Spain's 1997 deficit to gross domestic product ratio would be at 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>"Everything hinting Spain will be part of European Monetary Union for the outset brings a lowered spread and yields," a money market dealer in Madrid said. "The good news is Spain will meet the criteria. The bad news is that Italy will not."</p>
<p>But after having declined in anticipation, the Italian market also recovered in the afternoon on the news.  </p>
<p>As the lira also recouped initial losses, the peseta ended stronger trading at around 84.31/33 per mark. Dealers said that the currency recovery was also pulling bonos higher.</p>
<p>"A firmer peseta is the best insurance for the bond market," an analyst said.</p>
<p>On the short end of the yield curve, dealers started to anticipate a new possible official rate cut by mid-May.</p>
<p>Analysts are expecting that April's consumer price index could show a yearly rise breaking the two percent level from 2.2 percent in March.</p>
