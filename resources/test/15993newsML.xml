<p>The Austin Co agreed to pay a $4 million settlement to the U.S. government to resolve allegations that the engineering and construction firm overcharged for its pension costs on more than 40 government contracts between 1980 and 1990, the Justice Department said.</p>
<p>Austin Co's sales and marketing vice president Jeffrey Raday said the company admitted no wrongdoing.</p>
<p>"The settlement was the result of the government's interpretation of complex federal accounting regulations regarding pension costs," he said. "We believe that these regulations are subject to various interpretations."</p>
<p>Austin, a privately held company with 1995 sales of about $460 million, is based in Cleveland Heights and has offices elsewhere in the U.S. and overseas, Raday said. He said the government is a major customer and the settlement does not affect current contracts nor eligibility for future contracts.</p>
<p>Design projects in the case included post office and military facilities, the government said.</p>
<p>In a statement Monday, the Justice Department said the "whistleblower" civil case involved contracts for hundreds of millions of dollars and said the whistleblowers will receive a portion of the settlement.</p>
