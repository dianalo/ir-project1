<p>The battle for Sweden's largest mortgage lender, Stadshypotek, ended on Tuesday with insurer Skandia withdrawing its bid and allowing rival suitor Handelsbanken to take centre stage.</p>
<p>The end of the fight, which has refuelled merger and takeover speculation in Sweden's finance sector, was prompted by Stadshypotek and Sweden's shareholders association to recommend shareholders accepts Handelsbanken's bid.</p>
<p>"The board .. has unanimously decided to recommend shareholders accept the bid," Stadshypotek said in a statement.</p>
<p>Handelsbanken's offer, which values the country's largest mortgage lender at 22.9 billion crowns ($3.4 billion), is expected to close by the end of February.</p>
<p>The fight for Stadshypotek started on November 23 after the government announced plans to sell the state's 34 percent holding in the mortgage bank through a controlled auction.</p>
<p>But two days later Skandia's board forestalled the state's auction procedure by proposing with Stadshypotek's board a merger between the two companies in a share swap deal.</p>
<p>This deal valued Stadshypotek at about 21 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The proposal infuriated Finance Minister Erik Asbrink who said the state wanted to get the highest price possible.</p>
<p>But last Thursday the fight over Stadshypotek intensified when Handelsbanken, the largest bank in Sweden by assets, placed a 22.9 billion crown cash bid on Stadshypotek.</p>
<p>The bid immediately received government approval.</p>
<p>Faced with a bid from the cash-strongest bank in Sweden, Skandia did not boost its offer but withdrew on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Skandia said Handelsbanken's bid had been accepted by the state so the insurer was now unlikely to achieve its target to acquire more than 90 percent of the shares in Stadshypotek.</p>
<p>"It is not in the interest of our shareholders for Skandia to participate in a competitive bidding process for Stadshypotek," Skandia chairman Sven Soderberg said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Stadshypotek takeover has prompted renewed speculation about a restructing of Sweden's banking sector, expected to take place ahead of Europe's Monetary Union starting in 1999.</p>
<p>With Stadshypotek and Handelsbanken out of the way, the market is eyeing the other major banks, Nordbanken and S-E-Banken, and also Foreningsbanken.</p>
<p>"Everyone is calculating on mergers with everyone as all are under pressure from EMU," an analyst said.</p>
<p>"When EMU is a fact, Swedish banks will face competitors that are ten times larger than they are. They need to grow."</p>
<p>Market players were talking about a possible merger between Nordbanken and S-E-Banken, as reported in business daily Dagens Industri on Tuesday, and a takeover bid from Swedbank on Foreningsbanken .</p>
<p>Swedbank has already taken a 5.3 percent stake in Foreningsbanken. Analysts expect resistance from the farmers' associations, which hold around 20 percent in the bank, to soften and a takeover bid to eventually appear and succeed.</p>
<p>With just Nordbanken and S-E-Banken left, a merger between them is quite possible, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"There's been a lot of talk about such a merger and it is fairly likely," one analyst told Reuters.</p>
<p>Both banks refused to comment on current market speculation and the Finance Ministry on Tuesday told Reuters that the merger rumours were pure speculation.</p>
