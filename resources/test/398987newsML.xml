<headline>RTRS-S&amp;P assigns ratings to Adelaide Bank.</headline>

<p>Standard &amp; Poor's said on Monday it has assigned its BBB long-term rating and A-2 short-term rating to the senior notes and BBB-minus/A-3 ratings to the subordinated notes of Adelaide Bank's Ltd US$750 million Euro medium term note programme.</p>
<p>The rating outlook is stable  </p>
<p>S&amp;P said the ratings reflected Adelaide Bank's good asset quality, satisfactory financial performance, adequate capitalisation, and market franchise in its home state of South Australia.</p>
<p>Rating sensitivities were the bank's relatively lower absolute equity and asset size, and higher geographic concentration compared with regional bank peer averages, the rating agency added.</p>
<p>The outlook reflected S&amp;P's expectation that Adelaide Bank would continue to perform satisfactorily in a highly competitive environment.  </p>
<p>"While interest margins for hosuing loans are expected to come under pressure, the bank's diversification into business and consumer loans, and its efforts to develop fee income, are likely to compensate for this margin loss," S&amp;P said.</p>
