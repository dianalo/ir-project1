<p>The Dutch state will use an obsolete cash reserve at the central bank to fund part of its 33.5 billion guilder 1997 borrowing requirement, the Finance Ministry said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The cash reserve will be used to cut the amount that the government will actually have to borrow and thereby contributes to a lower public debt as a percentage of gross domestic product," Finance Ministry spokesman Raymond Salet said.</p>
<p>Budget documents said the central government borrowing requirement, before the injection of cash reserves, would fall to 33.5 billion guilders in 1997 from 35.1 billion in 1996.</p>
<p>A well-informed source at the Finance Ministry said that roughly 10 billion guilders from the cash reserve would be used to reduce the borrowing requirement of 33.5 billion guilders.</p>
<p>The cash reserve was previously used to finance the short-term liquidity needs of the Dutch state, but is being phased out because of changes in monetary policy agreed within the framework of European Monetary Union (EMU).</p>
<p>"The cash reserve is gradually phased out and reduced to close to zero in 1997," Salet said.</p>
<p>The cash reserve is estimated at 11.2 billion guilders at the end of 1996, the Finance Ministry said.</p>
