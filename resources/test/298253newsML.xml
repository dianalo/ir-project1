<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel warned a meeting of his Christian Social Union that a failure of European monetary union (EMU) could plunge Germany into economic crisis, party sources said.</p>
<p>Waigel said a failure of EMU, due to begin in January 1999, would threaten Germany with an economic crisis and currency-market chaos, the sources said.</p>
<p>At the February 8 meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Seven industrialised nations in Berlin, Waigel plans to discuss the state of the world economy and a debt initiative for the world's poorest nations, they said.</p>
<p>Domestically, he also aims to reform Germany's basic budgetary laws to increase flexibility and transparency, and circulated models of such budgetary reform at the party meeting on Wednesday, the sources said.</p>
