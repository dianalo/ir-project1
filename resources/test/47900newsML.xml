<p>Tokyo stocks rebounded by the close on Wednesday after trading lower for most of the day, with the market capped by profit-taking. Most participants were reluctant to move actively before the Nikkei's September futures and options are settled on Friday, brokers said.</p>
<p>The key 225-share Nikkei average was up 11.45 points, or 0.06 percent, to end at 20,571.04, after slipping to 20,425.44. Its December futures gained 20 points to 20,590.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market was lacklustre. Although the Nikkei's break below 20,000 last week was supported, the market lacked factors to test the upside, they said.  </p>
<p>Brokers in Tokyo said that a slight rise in the U.S. semiconductor book to bill ratio in August released on Tuesday was within expectations and had little impact on the market.</p>
<p>The Semiconductor Industry Association said the ratio rose to 0.90 in August from a revised 0.86 in July.</p>
<p>The recent trend of the weaker yen helped to buoy share pries in the automobile  0#TEQ.T sector, traders said.</p>
<p>Mazda Motor Corp rose 11 yen to end at 530, with Nissan Motor Co Ltd up five yen to close at 847, Toyota Motor Corp up 10 yen to end at 2,690 and Honda Motor Co Ltd up 40 yen to finish at 2,670.  </p>
<p>Shares of Gajoen Kanko KK continued to be ask-only on Wednesday as the Tokyo Stock Exchange's announcement that its shares have been placed under surveillance kept on inviting a rush of sales orders.</p>
<p>The hotel operator's share price was ask-only at 112 yen at 0530 GMT, against Tuesday's ask-only price at 162 yen.</p>
<p>The second section index lost 4.79 points or 0.23 percent to end at 2,100.35, with 11.48 million shares traded. The over-the-counter (OTC) index was also down 7.18 points or 0.46 percent at 1,558.69.</p>
