<p>U.S. Office Products Co., a major supplier to the growing small-business market, said on Thursday it agreed to acquire Mail Boxes Etc. in a deal worth $276.9 million.</p>
<p>The transaction, to be accomplished via a one-for-one stock swap, would give Mail Boxes shareholders a 24.8 percent premium based on the company's $19.625 closing price Wednesday and U.S. Office Products $24.50 close, both on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Mail Boxes' stock gained $2.875 to $22.50 in afternoon trading Thursday while U.S. Office fell $1.0625 to $23.4375.</p>
<p>In an interview, U.S. Office Products Chairman Jonathan Ledecky said that if his company's stock price drops below an average of $23 over the 20 days prior to the closing of the deal, it would not be completed.</p>
<p>If it is below $23, "we don't have to do the deal. Mail Boxes has the choice," he said. "But if the price is above $29, the terms will be ratably reduced on a percentage basis," he added.</p>
<p>For example, he said, if the average of U.S. Office's share price is $30, the swap would be 29/30 of a share for each Mail Boxes share. If it goes to $31, the ratio becomes 29/31. "But we are not going to increase the number of shares we are offering Mail Boxes Etc," Ladecky said.</p>
<p>Mail Boxes Etc. franchises business communication and postal service centres, with 3,300 locations worldwide. It would operate as a subsidiary of U.S. Office Products, keeping its current corporate officers and its San Diego headquarters.</p>
<p>Ledecky said that Mail Boxes Etc.'s focus on small business customers would complement his company's focus on middle-market businesses.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Ledecky told Reuters that he saw further consolidation in the office products industry in the wake of the proposed merger of Staples Inc. and Office Depot Inc. That merger faces opposition from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>U.S. Office Products said it does not expect the Mail Boxes Etc. deal to dilute its earnings in the current fiscal year, which ends in April 1998.</p>
<p>U.S. Office Products said merging its balance sheet with that of Mail Boxes would move it closer to its goal of a company-wide 8 percent operating margin.</p>
<p>The deal also would make United Parcel Service of America Inc. a significant U.S. Office Products shareholder. United Parcel currently owns more than 1.8 million Mail Boxes Etc. shares, U.S. Office Products said.</p>
<p>Ledecky said U.S. Office intends to continue its vigorous consolidation of middle-market office supply companies and noted an "untapped" $1 billion line of credit with Bankers Trust. He said the company's next transaction could be announced as early as next week.</p>
