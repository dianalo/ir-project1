<p>Pakistani military authorities said on Wednesday they would court martial a local employee of the United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) for "seducing" a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) officer.</p>
<p>Pakistani police had arrested the employee, Ayaz Baloch, in April for alleged involvement in drug trafficking and anti-state activities and ignored Washington's demand for his release.</p>
<p>A military statement on Wednesday said Baloch, who was working at the U.S. embassy in Islamabad, would be "tried by a field general court martial under the PAF Act for seducing a PAF officer".</p>
<p>It did not elaborate on the charge but noted that Baloch was taken into custody after the arrest of a PAF Squadron Leader Qasim Bhatti, who was sentenced by a military court last month to life imprisonment on charges of drug smuggling.</p>
<p>Another PAF officer, Squadron Leader Mohammad Farooq, is detained in the United States where he as was picked up by drug officials in April for allegedly carrying two kg (4.4 lb) of heroin in a PAF Boeing 707 aircraft.</p>
