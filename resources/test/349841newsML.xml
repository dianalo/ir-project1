<p>China and the United States have reached agreement on extending a 1994 accord on textile trade and will sign the deal Sunday, an official of China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation said.</p>
<p>"The two sides will be signing the agreement in a ceremony shortly," the official said by telephone.</p>
<p>The agreement averted a multimillion dollar cross-Pacific trade war with just hours to go before the deadline expired and after marathon talks between U.S. chief textile negotiator Rita Hayes and a team of Chinese officials.</p>
<p>The agreement was expected to cover renewal of a 1994 textile accord as well as resolution of a dispute over U.S. penalties on Chinese textile exports.</p>
<p>Washington slapped $19 million worth of penalties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.</p>
