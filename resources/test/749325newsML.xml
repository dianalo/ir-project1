<p>Jamie Tarses, the embattled president of ABC Entertainment, said Wednesday that she has no plans to leave the television network.</p>
<p>Speaking at a news conference for television writers previewing the network's fall lineup, Tarses said she was deeply committed and "very, very excited" about her work at the network and her efforts to improve ABC's ratings.</p>
<p>"It's what gets me out of bed every morning -- the prospect of ultimately getting our network back to No. 1," Tarses said.</p>
<p>Tarses' tenure at the No. 3 network has been the subject of considerable attention in New York and Hollywood after ABC hired veteran TV executive Stuart Bloomberg as chairman of the Entertainment division over Tarses. The controversy grew after a profile of Tarses in The New York Times Magazine angered top executives at ABC and its parent company Walt Disney Co.</p>
<p>Tarses, 33, joined ABC a little over a year ago from rival network NBC, where she helped launch such successful programmes as "Friends".</p>
<p>Wednesday's news conference focused almost exclusively on the executive drama, with reporters repeatedly asking Tarses and Bloomberg about the New York Times article, sexism in the industry and how they plan to work together.</p>
<p>The stir surrounding Tarses has been big enough to reach the NBC and CBS press tours, held last week. On Saturday, Warren Littlefield, president for entertainment at NBC and Tarses' former boss there, offered words of sympathy.</p>
<p>"I absolutely do feel for her," Littlefield told reporters. "I can remember myself being in the crossfire of controversy, but I've never seen it like this. Do I think it's more difficult for a woman to be in the top levels of business than a man? Yeah, I do."</p>
<p>ABC hired Tarses because of her success at NBC developing "Friends" and "Mad About You", shows that attracted the young, affluent, urban viewers advertisers pay top dollar for. When she joined ABC, Tarses hired a new ad agency in a bid to find a slogan to rival NBC'S catchy "Must See TV" campaign.</p>
<p>The result is a new slogan, "Television is Good," and a series of ads with tongue-in-cheek messages such as: "TV. What would you watch without it?" Some of the other ads in the $40 million campaign go further, with lines like "It's a Beautiful Day, What Are You Doing Outside?"; "The Couch is Your Friend"; "Don't Worry, You've Got Billions of Brain Cells," and "Life is Short. Watch TV."</p>
<p>Rival network NBC is owned by General Electric Co.</p>
