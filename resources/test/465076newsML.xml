<p>German Bundesbank council member Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher said on Monday he wanted the decision on who would participate in European monetary union to be brought forward.</p>
<p>Kuehbacher, speaking on German television, said that the decision on whether Germany could take part or not should be made after Germany's key May budget appraisal at the latest.</p>
<p>Referring to the deficit-to-gross domestic product ratio criterion, he added: "We should certainly not admonish those nations who are approaching the three percent (deficit-to-GDP) level".</p>
<p>There has been much speculation that Germany will not meet the three percent deficit-to-GDP threshold by the end of this year. EU head of states are due to decide on monetary uniion membership early next year on the basis of 1997 data.</p>
<p>Bonn has said it is targeting a deficit at 2.9 percent of GDP this year.</p>
