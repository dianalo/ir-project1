<p>New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, whose preliminary fiscal 1998 budget includes ending the city's four-percent sales tax on clothing, called for even bigger reductions for residents and businesses in later years.</p>
<p>Ending the city's sales tax on clothing that costs less than $500 by December 31 would cost New York City about $157 million in revenues in fiscal 1998, and around $279 million in 1999, the first full year of the tax break that must be approved by Albany.</p>
<p>The state also assesses a four percent tax on clothing, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is partly funded with a 0.25 percent levy, and Giuliani has recommended that both these taxes be abolished, saying the indirect benefits over time could help make up for the drop in tax collections.</p>
<p>Raising the tax credit for unincorporated businesses would save businesses a total of $53 million in fiscal 1998 and $57 million the next year, the mayor estimated.</p>
<p>The Administration also would give companies $30 million of tax relief in fiscal 1998 by adjusting commercial rent taxes, a sum that rises to $117 million in fiscal 1998.</p>
<p>The total amount of tax revenue that the city stands to lose under the mayor's new plan, which the City Council still must approve, would rise from $250 million in fiscal 1998 to $463 million in 1999 and $518 million in 2000.</p>
