<p>The NATO allies, saying all of Europe stood to gain, hailed Russia's decision on Wednesday to open talks with NATO on a special relationship despite its deep hostility to alliance plans to expand eastwards.</p>
<p>In a major change of policy, Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov told his 16 NATO counterparts Moscow was ready to enter into dialogue on a new security partnership between the former Cold War foes.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher called it "very good news". German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said he was delighted by Moscow's "constructive attitude".</p>
<p>"If a charter can be worked out between Russia and NATO, that will complete the integration of Europe, so we're started down the road of a unified, integrated Europe," Christopher told reporters after a two-day NATO meeting in Brussels.</p>
<p>Previously, Moscow had demanded NATO put enlargement on ice before the start of any negotiations.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, who has been authorised to lead the talks with the Russians, said NATO wanted to enter formal discussions as quickly as possible for the good of the entire continent.</p>
<p>"We want to push this dialogue down the road... security in Europe cannot be established without Russia," he told a news conference after Primakov's decision during a separate meeting on Wednesday with alliance foreign ministers.</p>
<p>Primakov's offer, accompanied by the now-familiar criticism of enlargement, came one day after the 16 alliance foreign ministers named July 8-9 as the date for a summit in Madrid to invite some former communist countries to open accession talks.</p>
<p>NATO stated firmly enlargement would go ahead, but to sugar the pill said they would not station nuclear weapons on the territory of new members and stressed they wanted a new upgraded relationship with Russia to be formalised at the same summit.</p>
<p>"We were made an offer to hold consultations with NATO in order to settle any issues that might be of concern to us. We agreed to this offer. I think this will open the door to fruitful talks," Primakov later told reporters.</p>
<p>But a stern-faced Primakov quickly added Moscow had not dropped its all-out opposition to NATO's plans to take in new members from former communist central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>"This is based on the firm belief that it will inevitably lead to a new division of Europe. That is unacceptable," he said.</p>
<p>But apart from sounding a jarring -- albeit predictable -- note over enlargement, Primakov was in a relaxed, easy-going mood in keeping with the atmosphere which now reigns in regular encounters between the two old enemies.</p>
<p>The July summit is also due to adopt a package of sweeping internal reforms to bring the most powerful alliance ever assembled into line with post-Cold War realities and allow it to undertake more Bosnia-style peace missions.</p>
<p>The NATO allies also agreed to send a new alliance-led Stabilisation Force to Bosnia when the mandate of the current force expires on December 20 to monitor the Dayton peace accords.</p>
<p>Russia has agreed to take part in the 25-30,000-strong force -- a factor which several alliance diplomats say played a large part in convincing Moscow to open talks with the alliance despite the impasse over enlargement.</p>
<p>Primakov said any NATO-Russia "document" should be far more than just a general set of principles and contain "very specific, very concrete" points addressing Moscow's security concerns.</p>
<p>NATO officials said they expected Solana to receive his negotiating brief very shortly and bargaining to begin in early January.</p>
<p>They said it would be a long, hard process with Moscow taking every opportunity to try and drive a wedge between the allies, many of whom are not sure how far they should go to satisfy Russia's anxieties.</p>
<p>NATO foreign ministers spent much of Wednesday trying to decide how to handle those countries wanting to join the alliance who are left out of the first wave of new members.</p>
<p>Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are the favourites to be invited to join out of a total of 11 countries now clamouring at NATO's door.</p>
<p>Solana said the allies had agreed to set up a new Atlantic Partnership Council bringing together some 27 of NATO's cooperation partners from central and eastern Europe under the same roof.</p>
