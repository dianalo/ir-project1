<p>World crude oil prices opened lower on Tuesday after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein pushed the button to start his country's first crude oil exports in six years.</p>
<p>Benchmark Brent Blend crude from the North Sea for January delivery began the morning session 18 cents below Monday's close.</p>
<p>It later fell a further 10 cents to $23.84 a barrel by 1035 GMT after news that Iraqi crude oil had begun to flow through the trans-Turkey pipeline under a U.N. plan to allow Baghdad to raise funds for its humanitarian needs</p>
<p>"The response has been muted. I am not entirely convinced that the market has a big hole underneath it," Alistair Harris, energy manager at Mees Pierson brokerage, said.</p>
<p>He added the reappearance of Iraqi crude, blocked by U.N. sanctions since Iraq's August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, coincided with a strong performance of refined products in a tight winter quarter.</p>
<p>Because refined products are so strong, refinery margins are good enough to support crude oil at these levels, Harris added.</p>
<p>Industry stocks have been low, forcing refineries to push production capacity to the limit to meet strong demand for heating oil during the northern hemisphere winter.</p>
<p>"We are a little sceptical of downside action and we noticed the lack of weakness on Monday of the U.S. market," Harris said.</p>
<p>He pointed out that forward crude oil prices were still discounted against the prompt month, which was a sign of a strong market. February Brent futures traded at a 57 discount to January crude on the International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The absence of Iraqi crude from the oil markets was partly the reason why prices shot to a near six-year high in October when the U.N. oil-for-food deal was postponed from September. Crude oil prices remain around $3.0 a barrel higher than this time last year.</p>
<p>Under the U.N. deal signed in May, Iraq will be allowed to sell $2.0 billion worth of crude oil for six months to buy food and medicines under strict U.N. supervision.</p>
<p>Iraq said it would export 650,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil through its pipeline to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan in Turkey under the U.N. plan cleared on Monday.</p>
<p>Other than Turkey, no firm buyers have emerged from among the more than 50 oil company executives Iraq said had flocked to Baghdad to conclude term deals.</p>
<p>A Turkish energy minister official said on Tuesday that Turkey was likely to hold a ceremony on December 16 to celebrate the loading of oil tankers.</p>
<p>Turkey's state-owned refiner Tupras said it had signed a contract with Iraq's state oil marketing firm SOMO to buy 75,000 bpd of Iraqi oil under an agreement taking effect Tuesday.</p>
<p>Exports to other destinations, particularly the sale of Basrah Light crude to the Far East through the Gulf terminal of Mina al-Bakr, are not expected before January, industry sources in Singapore said.</p>
<p>Iraq, the second biggest oil producer in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) after Saudi Arabia before the Gulf War, produced 3.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude in July 1990.</p>
<p>According to figures published in the Arab Oil and Gas Journal in 1993, oil exports fell in the eight months to August 1990 to 1.6 million bpd compared with a yearly total of 2.3 million bpd in 1989.</p>
