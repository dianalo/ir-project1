<p>The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) left its offers for next-day firm and non-firm sales unchanged for a third consecutive day, the federal power marketing agency said Thursday.</p>
<p>In addition, Friday sales volumes for firm power between 1300 and 2100 PDT were still limited to 200 megawatts.</p>
<p>Offer prices between those hours are unchanged at $20.00 per megawatt hour (MWh) for firm sales ($19.00 for non-firm) and $18.00 per MWh ($17.00 non-firm) for hours 0700-1200 and 2200-2300.</p>
<p>BPA continued to offer power during early morning hours of 2400 to 0600 PDT on Friday at $13.00 per MWh.</p>
<p>Market sources in the Northwest said the Bonneville offers would continue to be undercut by other generators of hydroelectric power.</p>
