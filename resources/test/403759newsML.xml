<p>Fast food chain Burger King in the United States, owned by food and drink giant Grand Metropolitan Plc, said it has no plans to change its prices.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Burger King said "there are no current plans to change our prices." A report in today's Wall Street Journal said McDonald's Corp, Burger King's biggest competitor, plans to drop the price of a Big Mac from $1.90 to $0.55 with the purchase of fries and a drink.  </p>
<p>In a statement, Burger King said it is "committed to providing products with the best quality taste and value for our customers every day, not just during special prpmotions. We feel it is this strategy that gives strength to our brand and has earned the company increased performance in the market."</p>
<p>GrandMet shares were down 18-1/2p at 475p near the close on fears that a price war in fast food in the United States would hit earnings at Burger King.  </p>
<p>A Burger King meal which includes a Whopper hamburger, fries and a drink is $2.99. BK has 8,600 outlets worlwide with 6,900 of those in the United States.</p>
<p>BK contributed 167 million stg to group trading profits in 1996, down from 196 million.</p>
