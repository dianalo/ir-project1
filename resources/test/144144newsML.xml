<p>Hologic Inc said on Friday there had been no fundamental changes in the company or its business to warrant the recent decline in its share price.</p>
<p>Hologic Chairman and Chief Executive Officer S. David Ellenbogen said, "We are unable to explain the recent decrease in our stock price in light of the bright prospects in the company's core business of bone densitometry and our recently acquired FluoroScan."  </p>
<p>Shares of Hologic, which develops, manufactures and markets proprietary x-ray and ultrasound systems, were up 7/8 at 20-1/8, but below a 52-week intraday high of 49-1/2.</p>
<p>The company also said it was comfortable with analyst estimates for the current quarter and and fiscal 1997.</p>
<p>The First Call mean earnings estimate for the fourth quarter was $0.23 per share, for fiscal 1996 was $0.96 per share, and for fiscal 1997 was $1.30 per share.</p>
<p>Hologic said it would announce results for the full fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September 28 on November 12.</p>
