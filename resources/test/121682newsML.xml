<p>A strike by bus, tram and commuter train workers brought traffic chaos to northern Italy on Wednesday, adding to problems caused by two days of torrential rain.</p>
<p>Union leaders said they called the stoppage to demand a renewal of workers' contracts which expired around nine months ago and to demand reform to the local transport system.</p>
<p>The eight-hour strike hit almost all of northern Italy. But it was called off in the town of Reggio Emilia after a moderate earthquake on Tuesday in which two people died and buildings were slightly damaged. The town was near the epicentre.</p>
<p>Transport workers were due to strike in central Italy on Thursday, except in Rome where the strike was put off until next Tuesday after an appeal by mayor Francesco Rutelli.</p>
<p>He feared that transport chaos would paint a poor picture of the city for visiting International Olympic Committee officials looking at Rome's bid to host the 2004 Summer Games.</p>
<p>The stoppage was due to spread to southern Italy on Friday ahead of a national strike on October 25.</p>
