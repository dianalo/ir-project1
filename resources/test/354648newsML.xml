<p>Suspected separatist guerrillas shot dead four policemen and five pro-government militants on Tuesday in two separate incidents in Kashmir, police said.</p>
<p>A police spokesman in Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu and Kashmir state, said militants entered a house at Panjipora village in the early morning and opened fire. The village is about 48 km (30 miles) north of Srinagar,</p>
<p>Five militants who support Indian rule in the Himalayan region were killed on the spot, he said.</p>
<p>Later, in the border district of Kupwara, 80 km (50 miles) north of Srinagar, separatist militants opened fire on a group of policemen after they had escorted a van to a bank where it deposited money. Four policemen died, authorities said.</p>
<p>More than a dozen militant groups are fighting New Delhi's rule in Jammu and Kashmir, mostly Hindu India's only Moslem majority state. At least three pro-government militia groups are pitted against the separatists.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have been killed in insurgency-related violence since the separatist revolt erupted seven years ago.</p>
