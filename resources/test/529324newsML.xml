<p>U.S. Midwest direct hog prices early Tuesday were steady to $0.50 per cwt, instances $1.00 lower amid continued light demand as some packers maintain lighter slaughter schedules, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>At least one major packer indicated it would operate six- to six-and-a-half-hour shifts all week, they said.</p>
<p>Slaughter was reduced Monday when margins narrowed amid higher hog prices last week and sluggish pork demand, industry sources and packer spokesmen said.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hogs sold $0.50 lower, with a $55.50 country top and $56.50 at plants.</p>
