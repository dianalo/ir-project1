<p>A government-appointed reformer at Russian national power grid holder UES will help forge a deal with Siberian utility Irkutskenergo over its plan to sell power to Mongolia, a top anti-monopoly official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>UES has blocked Irkutskenergo from exporting electricity to Mongolia on its power lines, without economic or technical reasons, acting chairman of the state anti-monopoly committee Vadim Belov told a news conference.</p>
<p>"It seems to me that the new vice-president of RAO UES (Boris) Brevnov understands all the difficulties of this situation and a compromise will be found," he said.</p>
<p>Irkutskenergo produces some of Russia's cheapest electricity but is forced to sell oversupplies to UES at prices UES sets for resale in Russia.</p>
<p>Brevnov was recently appointed UES vice-president at the urging of the Russian government, which has vowed to reform the company and increase government control over it.</p>
<p>"If no compromise is found, we will continue the matter to its logical end in court and insist that RAO UES respect its competitor Irkutskenergo," Belov said.</p>
<p>He added that the court, which postponed hearings at the request of UES and the committee, would meet again in early June to consider one of a number of suits.</p>
<p>If no compromise is found it would take a total of four of five months from now to solve the problem, he said. The court battle has already lasted about four months, he added.</p>
<p>Belov did not comment on a separate battle between Irkustkenergo and UES over ownership of hydropower stations operated by Irkutskenergo and claimed by UES.</p>
