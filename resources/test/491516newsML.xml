<p>Indian blue chips ended lower in quiet trading on Monday as players waited nervously for a confidence vote in the government at the end of the week, traders said.</p>
<p>Both domestic and foreign funds remained on the sidelines, and are likely to stay there unless there is a fresh twist in New Delhi's politics ahead of Friday's vote.</p>
<p>"The uncertainty is increasing rather than decreasing," said Subra Subramanian, director at securities firm H.G. Asia. "This weekend has not helped much."  </p>
<p>"Things are so much in the air -- the market will trade in a dead zone this week," the chief dealer at a U.K.-based brokerage said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's 15-party minority United Front alliance has to face a vote of confidence on Friday, after the Congress Party last week withdrew its crucial support to the government.</p>
<p>"I think we might see a period of low trading activity this week," said Himanshu Kaji, a member-broker of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE). "The future course of the markets will depend on the crucial vote of confidence."  </p>
<p>The government is also trying to put a contingency in place on Friday for its budget proposals.</p>
<p>Most political parties have said they would not allow the political impasse to derail the 1997/98 (April-March) February 28 budget which is still to be passed by Parliament.</p>
<p>"The Steering Committee of the United Front is going to meet on April 9 at 5 pm (1130 GMT)," United Front spokesman Jaipal Reddy told reporters in New Delhi on Monday.</p>
<p>"We will take a collective view on the budget and after that we will get in touch with the speaker (of the lower house of parliament) and other parties and evolve consensus view."  </p>
<p>Bombay exchanges are closed on Tuesday for a local holiday.</p>
