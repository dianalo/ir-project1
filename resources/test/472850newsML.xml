<p>Alliance Imaging Inc said Thursday that General Electric Co has taken a 21 percent stake in the company after GE's medical systems division converted an $18 million bridge loan into equity.</p>
<p>The investment completed the final phase of its refinancing and put it in a substantially stronger financial position, Alliance Imaging said.  </p>
<p>It said General Electric converted the bridge loan into a new series of preferred stock that is convertible into common stock at $6 per share. The conversion was part of an agreement negotiated in November, it said.</p>
<p>In connection with the conversion, General Electric received an option to convert up to about $8 million of Alliance Imaging's senior notes into a new issue of series E 4 percent convertible preferred stock, it said.  The notes are not convertible until Jan. 1, 1998.  </p>
<p>The bridge loan allowed it to cut its long-term debt by $21.4 million, raised shareholders' equity by $11.3 million and removed a number of restrictive loan covenants, it said.</p>
<p>It said that, it expects to make about $32 million in savings if the preferred stock is converted into common shares at the end of its 10-year term. The savings will come from reduced interest and preferred stock dividends and the elimination of requirements that it make prior debt repayments and redeem preferred stock.  </p>
<p>Richard Zehner, Alliance Imaging's president and chief executive officer, said the company's improved financial strength now increases its capability to invest in new imaging systems and acquire other companies.</p>
<p>Zehner said his company appreciated GE's confidence in Alliance Imaging's management, noting that the preferred stock purchased was non-voting and did not require board representation rights.</p>
<p>The transaction also does not include any agreements affecting Alliance's futurer purchasing or investment decisions, he said.</p>
