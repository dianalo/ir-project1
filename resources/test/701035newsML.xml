<p>U.S. stocks edged higher on Tuesday after the Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged following a two-day meeting of the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee.</p>
<p>Most U.S. economists had expected the Fed to keep monetary policy unchanged.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials were up about six points at 7728 after spending most of the day in negative territory.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was up five to 896, slightly higher than prior to the announcement. The Nasdaq composite was up nine at 1447, also modestly adding to prior gains.  </p>
<p>Following are comments from U.S. market watchers on the FOMC news:</p>
<p>ALAN ACKERMAN, MARKET STRATEGIST, FAHNESTOCK &amp; CO:</p>
<p>-- "The Fed has few reasons to raise rates, there's not enough inflation to rattle the Fed's cage. The market was beginning to feel comfortable with the fact that interest rates would be unchanged."</p>
<p>-- "This could bring some bargain hunters out but the market is still somewhat cautious ahead the upcoming stream of second quarter earnings."  </p>
<p>TOM CARPENTER, A MANAGING DIRECTOR AND CHIEF ECONOMIST, ASB CAPITAL MANAGEMENT INC:</p>
<p>-- "The lack of change in monetary policy and the therapeutic effects of that have been embedded in stock prices for the past three weeks, so we would not expect to see much of a pop in stock prices today.</p>
<p>-- "But what the stock market is not looking at is the likelihood that the Federal Reserve probably will not raise rates at its August meeting. Once the bond market comes to this conclusion, stocks should get support."  </p>
<p>GUY TRUICKO, EQUITY PORTFOLIO MANAGER, UNITY MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>-- "The Fed did exactly what everybody expected them to do...Tomorrow is the important day because of the (June) employment numbers. If that surprises on the upside, that could hurt the bond market."</p>
