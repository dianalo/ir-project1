<p>Spot power prices in the Northwest U.S. were lower amid ample hydropower supplies, but forecasts for cold weather in the Rocky Mountain region helped boost Southwest prices, trade sources said Monday.</p>
<p>"Prices started backing off at the end of the morning at COB (California-Oregon border), but prices in the Southwest improved over time," said one trader.</p>
<p>The softer Northwest tone was attributed to lower prices from the Bonneville Power Administration and weak demand from regional utilities.</p>
<p>"On-peak is pretty well balanced, but off-peak is certainly in oversupply," said a northern California trader.</p>
<p>He expected prices to drop further into next week as brimming reservoirs at California hydroelectric dam projects are drawn down to make room for future rainfall.</p>
<p>Firm, peak electricity at the California-Oregon border (COB) for Tuesday was quoted $16.50-18.00 per megawatt hour (MWh), down from $18.00-20.00 for Monday.</p>
<p>Off-peak COB for Tuesday was quoted $9.00-10.00, down from $11.00-12.00.</p>
<p>Tuesday firm, peak power at Mid-Columbia (Mid-C) was quoted at $14.00-$17.00, while off-peak was at $8.00-9.00.</p>
<p>Firm, peak Palo Verde (PV) electricity for Tuesday was quoted at $16.50-17.50, up from $15.00-17.00.</p>
<p>Off-peak PV for Monday was quoted $9.00-10.00 per MWh.</p>
<p>Monday firm, peak prices at Four Corners were quoted $17.00-19.00, with off-peak at $9.00-10.00.</p>
