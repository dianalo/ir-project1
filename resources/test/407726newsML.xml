<p>Sensormatic Electronics Corp said Thursday that Checkpoint Systems Deutschland GmbH, the German affiliate of Checkpoint Systems Inc, will stop disseminating information that Sensormatic had alleged false or misleading as a result of a formal cease and desist decree issued by a German court.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the decree, Checkpoint will cease disseminating certain information about Sensormatic's acousto-magnetic technology and its performance, supposed health hazards, and system suitability for "source tagging," the process of putting anti-theft tags on consumer goods at the point of manufacture or packaging.  </p>
<p>The company said that as part of the decree, Checkpoint will also refrain from disseminating certain disputed information about its own products.</p>
<p>Checkpoint's cease and desist decree follows a lawsuit filed by Sensormatic in the German courts in August, 1996.  The decree, said Sensormatic, was agred upon immediately before the German court would have rendered its decision.</p>
<p>Sensormatic is a supplier of electronic security systems to the retail, commercial and industrial marketplaces.</p>
