<p>Zimbabwean shares were mixed in active trade on Thursday though most players continued exercising caution while they waited for direction from key fundamentals, brokers said.</p>
<p>"The market was fairly active and we saw some good volumes traded," one broker said.</p>
<p>"But most people are still studying the situation and waiting to see what happens especially with the rains," he added.</p>
<p>Brokers said while the on-going strike by junior doctors and nurses had not yet affected the market, government's handling of the situation would probably filter through at a later stage.</p>
<p>On Thursday, road haulage company Clan and sugar processor ZSR both traded 10 cents firmer at 280 and 1,400 respectively while National Foods added 40 cents to 700, cloth retailers H and S put on 200 cents to 500 and pharmaceutical group CAPS upped 50 cents to 300.</p>
<p>Other gains were in seed company Seedco, which crept up five cents to 190, tobacco sales firm TSL which put on 20 cents to 590 and furniture and clothing retailers Tedco, 10 cents up at 630 in reasonable turnover.</p>
<p>The day's losers included discount house DCZ, tea and coffee growers EHPL, Flexible Packaging preferentials and paper firm Hunyani warrants, which all shed five cents to 175, 130, 30 and 155 respectively.</p>
<p>Timber producer Border lost 25 cents to 1,275 and hotel and supermarket group Meikles was 100 cents weaker at 2,700. A 25 cent drop to 3,250 in blue-chip conglomerate Delta helped push the key 57-counter index 15.31 points down to 7,902.10.</p>
<p>Minings were quiet with most counters trading unchanged at previous levels but a 10 cent gain in coal miners Wankie to 375 and another advance in gold producer Falcon, 50 cents up at 1,700, nudged the seven-share index five points up to 1,216.36.</p>
