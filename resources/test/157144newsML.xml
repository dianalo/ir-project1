<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat warned Israel on Thursday that a military conflict with Syria would imperil the entire Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>But he also told a news conference in Madrid that he was committed to the peace process and he was confident that it would prevail over any "temptations" to revert to war.</p>
<p>Asked how he would view a limited military conflict between Israel and Syria, Arafat said: "I think this would be a very dangerous adventure and very serious for the entire peace process.</p>
<p>"We know that a few days ago the Israeli army carried out military manoeuvres on the Golan Heights. We know there are troop concentrations in that area. But we are also convinced that peace and the work to achieve peace will be much stronger than any other temptations."</p>
<p>Arafat was in Spain to mark the anniversary of the Madrid Middle East peace conference that convened on October 31, 1991, and gave the first opportunity to Palestinians to speak for themselves on a world stage.</p>
<p>He has visited several European capitals this week to seek European help and support in his latest crisis with Israel over its reluctance to implement a previously-agreed troop withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>Arafat called peace with Israel a "strategic alternative." His Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) gave up decades of fruitless armed struggle in favour of a 1993 peace deal which gave Palestinians a degree of self rule in Gaza and part of the West Bank.</p>
<p>But Israeli sceptics say the peace deal was merely the first phase of a Palestinian plan to win control of Israel as well.</p>
<p>Arafat was quoted earlier by the Arabic daily Al-Hayat as saying he thought Israel could do anything -- even initiate a war -- to escape implementing peace deals signed with Arabs.</p>
<p>Syria too views peace with Israel as a strategic alternative to win back the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967, after decades of striving for military parity with Israel.</p>
<p>It fanned war fears in Israel by redeploying about 12,000 of its troops in Lebanon in September, some to within striking distance of a key Israeli position on the Golan Heights.</p>
<p>The European Union has seized on the latest crisis to try to assert a bigger diplomatic role in the Middle East, where it is already the chief aid donor.</p>
<p>Arafat, sitting beside Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar at the news conference, endorsed those efforts.</p>
<p>"In the first place, who said we don't want a European mediator...We insist on the presence of a European mediator alongside a North American and a Russian mediator also," he said.</p>
<p>Aznar, who announced that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would visit Spain on December 3, said Spain and the EU wanted to see the peace process unblocked and peace accords implemented.</p>
<p>Spain had issued separate invitations to Arafat and Netanyahu to mark the fifth anniversary of the Madrid peace conference.</p>
<p>On Israel's insistence, Palestinians attended the conference as part of a joint delegation with Jordan. But they won the right to equal speaking time and gave their own separate press briefings to plead their cause before the world's media.</p>
