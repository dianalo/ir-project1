<headline>ING says insurance results rise strongly.</headline>

<p>ING Groep NV (ING) said on Thursday that results from life, non-life and general insurance all rose strongly in the first nine months of 1996.</p>
<p>Life profits rose 14.8 percent, non-life by 16.3 percent and general insurance by 17.6 percent, as total pre-tax profits from insurance grew 16 percent to 1.72 billion guilders.</p>
<p>It said stronger results from the Netherlands, Hungary and Australia were especially responsible for the higher life result, while sharply improved results in the Netherlands and Australia contributed to the non-life result.</p>
<p>The comparative period in 1995 was marred by a 60 million guilder charge related to hurricane Luis in the Caribbean, while the 1996 result was affected by a severe winter and U.S. storms.</p>
<p>ING said that within non-life, fire operations remained loss-making due to U.S. weather conditions, but motor results showed a considerable improvement in almost all areas.</p>
<p>Health results deteriorated due to the North American operations, while a fall in the accident result in the Netherlands was offset by an increase in North America.</p>
<p>Insurance costs grew 18.6 percent to 4.22 billion guilders in the nine month period, it said.</p>
<p>This was mainly a result of 150 million guilders of extra provisions for information technology, reorganisations, enhanced marketing efforts, the introduction of the euro and the year 2000.</p>
