<p>All the talk about the new information age and its amazing technology during one of the world's leading telecommunications gatherings this week will not change the lives of the poor, a senior academic said on Friday.</p>
<p>"Companies spend all their time looking for killer applications for this technology," said William Melody, chairman of the international advisory board at the Technical University of Denmark.</p>
<p>"So far the biggest two are gambling and pornography," Melody told delegates attending the Asia Telecom 97 trade fair.</p>
<p>"If these are the killer applications of the intelligent network age we have to redefine the meaning of intellgence," he said.</p>
<p>"What has been talked about here is of no relevance to the poorest half of the world's population," Melody told Reuters after his speech.</p>
<p>"It's not going to improve their lives in any way."</p>
<p>Melody said the intelligent technology and networks of the Information Age were wasted on lowest common denominator -- entertainment -- while its potential as an educational, life-improving tool was being ignored.</p>
<p>"Should we use intelligent networks to make unintelligent people intelligent, or just use them to throw out the applications that the unintelligent wealthy want?" he asked.</p>
<p>Melody dismissed the bulk of discussions at the gatherings of telecommunications and technology executives as "unimportant" in terms of their contribution to the debate on how to use technology to improve the lives of the world's poor.</p>
<p>He said most exhibitors were delivering services designed for developed countries and aiming content at the world's richest consumers.</p>
<p>And he said too much money and effort was expended on esoteric issues like infrastructure architecture and building intelligent cities.</p>
<p>"Are we investing as much in trying to create intelligent people?" he asked.</p>
<p>With about two thirds of Asia's population not even connected to the most basic telephone services, it was clear that "if you do not have access to a telephone, you are not going to be able to participate in any of this," Melody said.</p>
<p>"If people cannot participate properly, how can we educate them to allow them to participate."</p>
<p>Melody described the major challenge facing telecommunications companies in the Information Age was "how to take the technology and apply it to the poorest cities in the world".</p>
<p>Failure to do so would create a society of information have and have-nots, "bifurcated into people who are much better off and those who are very poor", he said.</p>
