<p>Unlisted Dutch venture capital firm UPM Groep said on Tuesday it had bought a 25 percent stake in Germany's KMH Group.</p>
<p>KMH is a group of 13 companies which are active in industrial services including renting out building equipment and semi-permanent accommodation. The company, which also has outlets in the Netherlands, has 760 employees and posts a total annual turnover of more than 200 million marks.</p>
<p>UPM said it will support KMH in its international expansion plans and added the German firm is seeking a dominant position in its market segments.</p>
<p>UPM gave no financial details of the KMH stake purchase. The interest was taken by its unit UPM Investments which has total assets of 150 million guilders.</p>
<p>"Given the many interesting opportunities the German market is offering for clustering medium-sized companies, it can be expected that more stakes will be bought (by UPM) there in future," the Dutch venture capital group said in a statement.</p>
<p>UPM is owned by a number of Dutch insurers and large pension funds.</p>
