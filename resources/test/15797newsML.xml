<p>The United States has called off "open skies" aviation talks with Britain set for this week, the Transportation Department said Tuesday, saying the two sides remained too far apart for productive negotiations.</p>
<p>"The U.K proposal that was provided fell so far short of providing the essential elements of an open skies agreement, it did not provide the basis for discussion," a department spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said the two sides remained in touch and that the United States was ready to resume negotiations if "the basis for productive talks can be developed."</p>
<p>The talks sought to remove restrictions between the two countries, allowing domestic airlines to compete with fewer barriers, potentially leading to joint alliances.</p>
<p>The talks were scheduled to be held Wednesday and Thursday in Washington. The spokesman said the U.S. side had received the British proposal on Friday.</p>
<p>The department in the past has said that an "open skies" agreement with Britain was needed before anti-trust immunity could be provided for a proposed alliance between British Airways and AMR Corp's American Airlines.</p>
