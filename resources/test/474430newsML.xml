<p>The Luxembourg government said Friday it would seek a second mobile telephone operator as part of a new law liberalising the telecommunications sector in the Grand Duchy.  </p>
<p>"An appeal for candidates will be made in the coming weeks," the government said in a statement released following its weekly cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>The new law, which aims to bring Luxembourg into line with European Union directives opening the telecoms sector to full competition from 1998, received parliamentary approval earlier this month.</p>
<p>The government said the law would enter into force on April 1. It did not indicate whether it was maintaining an earlier request with the EU to continue to protect Luxembourg's domestic voice telephony market until 2000.  </p>
<p>A government spokesman was not available for comment.</p>
<p>"The law creates a new regime for licences and the operation of telecommunications networks and the provision of services," the government said.</p>
<p>A new regulator -- the Institut Luxembourgeois des Telecommunications -- would be set up to oversee the opening up of the market, it added.</p>
<p>Luxembourg partially privatised electricity company Cegedel is one of the companies that has said it may be interested in entering the telecoms market alone or in partnership with other companies.</p>
