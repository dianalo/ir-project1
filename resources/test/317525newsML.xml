<p>The average yield on Egyptian three-month treasury bills has slipped below 10 percent for the first time in recent history and bankers said on Sunday they doubted the rate would go up again in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Foreign interest in the Egyptian fixed-interest market has been an important factor in the decline of the benchmark rate and a sovereign rating by Standard and Poor's last week has only encouraged that trend, the bankers said.</p>
<p>The same factor has pushed up the value of the Egyptian pound against the dollar, the bankers said.</p>
<p>The increase is marginal, measurable in fractions of a piastre (one hundredth of a pound), but even this is significant given the pound's long-term stability, they said.</p>
<p>The upward pressure on the pound relieves the government of the need to keep interest rates high, as it has done in the past to support the pound in the markets.</p>
<p>The average yield on three-month bills issued last Thursday fell to 9.984 percent, from 10.015 percent one week earlier and 10.554 percent a year ago. The treasury began to issue the bills in 1991, at rates around the 20 percent level.</p>
<p>Predictably, the gradual decline in treasury bill rates has coincided with the sudden flow of foreign funds into Egypt as foreign investors realised the government was serious about privatisation and economic reform.</p>
<p>It accelerated a little around the time of the Middle East and North Africa economic conference in November, which helped to focus attention on Egypt as an investment destination.</p>
<p>Some bankers say they expected the rates to keep falling, possibly down to nine percent, but others predicted stability at around the current level.</p>
<p>"I think it will drift down gently but it won't go below nine percent," said an economist close to the central bank.</p>
<p>"There's been a lot of foreign money coming in because of the spread (between rates on the dollar and rates on the pound). The decline is a response to the market and also an attempt to reduce the capital inflows -- or at least the authorities are not inclined to discourage it," he added.</p>
<p>"There's more room for rates to fall and 9.5 percent is within reach," the economist said.</p>
<p>One banker said the rates could fall as low as nine percent, which he described as the level at which the central bank would decide to stop them falling further.</p>
<p>"The Standard and Poor's rating is good and we've had lots of enquiries about the Egyptian market since then. Even at nine percent there's a good spread (over rates on the dollar) and I see no risk of devaluation," he added.</p>
<p>"The only thing that could upset it is a stock market crash but even the stock market is still far from international standards (on P/E ratios)," he said. The average P/E ratio in Egypt now is about 12.</p>
<p>But some other bankers said they expected the rates would stick at the current levels. "I think they will be stable at 10 percent for some time to come. The exchange rate will also be stable -- at around 3.4 pounds to the dollar," said one.</p>
<p>But the central bank would probably cut its discount rate to 12.75 percent from 13 percent sooner or later, he added. The discount rate has little practical application in Egypt, except as an indication of where the central bank wants rates to be.</p>
<p>One banker, basing his calculations on charts, predicted that the pound could appreciate to 3.3870 pounds to the dollar. He said he was unaware of any government policy against pound appreciation, which would hit exports.</p>
<p>Minister of State Youssef Boutros-Ghali told Reuters last month that the authorities would not let the pound rise.</p>
