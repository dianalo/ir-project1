<p>Euro fuel oil gained on Thursday as supply worries hit the market, with the Rotterdam and Antwerp barge market maintaining its surprising summer strength, traders said.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges traded at $93, $93.25 and $93.50 as 25-30,000 tonnes of bunker demand entered the ARA market. Prices later sank back 50 cents to quote at $92.50/$93.50 a tonne. The gyrations in the crude price in the last 24 hours had little effect, traders added.</p>
<p>Low sulphur also gained a little, with swaps for August quoted at $94.25/$95, up from $93/$94.</p>
<p>Some said the gain was just to maintain the minimum differential between high and low sulphur quotes while others said a perception had crept in that August one percent cargoes were not as generously supplied as previously thought.</p>
<p>The anticipated flood of cracked Russian material has not materialised or is being steadily absorbed, traders said. Cracked M100 was heard bought at two means plus $1.15 and other offers were heard in the $1 to $2 range.</p>
<p>A large trader was seen enquiring for an 80kt vessel for first week August to take Baltic fuel trans-atlantic but some doubted the arbitrage could be made to work at current numbers.  </p>
