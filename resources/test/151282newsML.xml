<p>Property company MEPC Plc said it will redevelop Woolgate House, the London headquarters of Chase Manhattan Bank since 1967, which falls vacant in June 1997.</p>
<p>After the merger of Chase and Chemical Bank earlier this year Woolgate House became surplus to their needs.</p>
<p>"It will cost 180 million stg to redevelop and that includes the freehold for the site. When our contract with Chase becomes unconditional we will be committed to pay 75 million stg to Chase in 2001," said MEPC director Julian Barwick.  </p>
<p>MEPC plans to flatten the existing building and provide 33,000 square metres of office space on nine floors including one at ground level, making it the largest development in London's financial district.</p>
<p>Woolgate House, acquired in 1993 by the current joint owners Scottish Amicable Life Assurance Society and overseas property fund PGGM, lies next to the 15th century Guildhall, the capital's civic centre, which holds the annual Lord Mayor's banquet.  </p>
<p>MEPC said a planning application for the site will be submitted before the end of 1996 and the development should be completed in 1999.</p>
<p>"The development is virtually unrivalled in its scale in the city core," said Barwick.</p>
<p>"There are a number of occupiers looking for space in the range of 2,500 to 5,000 square metres who will find this project of considerable interest."</p>
<p>"Rents are also undoubtedly hardening and I think the market will continue to strengthen at a modest rate over the next couple of years."</p>
