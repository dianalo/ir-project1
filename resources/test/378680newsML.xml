<p>Much higher than expected placements of cattle onto feedlots during January may be the result of the movement of cattle that were in holding pens in December, analysts said.</p>
<p>A revision to year-ago placements added to the large number, they said.</p>
<p>"There were probably some young cattle that were put in a holding position during the month of December, not put on full feed and therefore not defined as placements during December that made it into feedlots during the month of January," said Chuck Levitt, senior analyst for Alaron Trading Corp.</p>
<p>The USDA on Friday reported January placements of cattle on feedlots of 1,000 head or more in the seven major feedlot states at 125 per cent of last year, sharply above the average analyst estimate of 107.5 percent and above the high end of expectations at 114.6 percent. On-feed supplies were put at 106 percent of a year ago, also above the average estimate of 103.9 percent and the high end of estimates at 105.4 percent.</p>
<p>Levitt noted that cattle can be placed in holding pens next to a feedlot and not be counted in the number of cattle placed on feed.</p>
<p>Revisions to last year's placements and marketings also added to the large placement number and boosted the percent of marketings this year over last year. January placements and marketings were both revised downward by 60,000 head.</p>
<p>"Most people were fairly confident that the number in December was bigger than (USDA) reported. That (January) placement figure now puts it exactly where it was two years ago," said Tom Tippens, CEO, Professional Cattle Consultants.</p>
<p>Levitt noted, "The placements against an unrevised number for last year would still have been up 20 percent, a couple of hundred thousand head larger than we expected," Levitt said.</p>
<p>Analysts think many of the cattle that went on feed in January were lightweight cattle. If some of those were on feed for part of December, they could be ready for market by April. However, the bulk of them are expected to be marketed in May and June, and Friday's report is expected to hit June futures the hardest, they said.</p>
<p>Live cattle futures at the CME are expected to trade near steady in February, mostly 0.500 cent lower in April and 1.000 cent lower in June and August as the large placements weigh on deferred contracts, analysts said.  </p>
<p>Analysts were uncertain about the report's effect on feeder cattle futures. The big placements number is negative to back months of live cattle futures, but consequently there may not be many cattle left to be placed. Expectations on feeder cattle ranged from steady to mostly 0.500 cent lower on Tuesday.</p>
<p>January marketings were put at 107 percent of last year, well above the average estimate for 101.3 percent and above the high end of expectations of 104.0 percent.</p>
<p>"Marketings showed that they were current coming into the month of February," Levitt said. "The steer and heifer slaughter during the month of January supports the marketing figure of being up two or three percent from an unrevised number for last year."</p>
<p>Tippens considered the marketings figure supportive to April, as cattle placed in January would not be ready for market in 90 days.</p>
<p>"You can't make very many cattle fat in 90 days," he said.</p>
