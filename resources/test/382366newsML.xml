<p>A high-ranking delegation from Portugal's banking, telecommunications, energy and transport sectors joining President Jorge Sampaio on a trip to Macau and China is seeking to expand trade with the region.</p>
<p>Presidential spokeswoman Elisabete Caramelo said trade was a top priority of the six-day visit to the territory of Macau starting on Tuesday, followed by eight days in China.</p>
<p>The 100-strong delegation includes the heads of Portugal's biggest private banks, Banco Comercial Portugues, Banco Pinto &amp; Sotto Mayor, Banco Espirito Santo, the Mello group and telecommunications operator Portugal Telecom, Caramelo said.</p>
<p>She said the banks were considering opening offices in China and that Portugal Telecom was interested in the possibility of entering the mobile phone business there.</p>
<p>The delegation also includes Economy Minister Augusto Mateus, whose portfolio includes foreign investment, and the heads of state utility EDP-Electricidade de Portugal and state airline TAP-Air Portugal.</p>
<p>"The visit will focus on boosting trade relations with China," Caramelo told Reuters in a telephone interview before her departure with Sampaio.</p>
<p>"This is an exploratory trip. These companies are on the lookout for business opportunities," she added.</p>
<p>Portugal is due to hand over the territory of Macau on December 31, 1999, two and a half years after Britain relinquishes control over nearby Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Portugal's biggest private bank, Banco Comercial Portugues, has said it was seeking a partner in Macau to develop the business of its retail bank unit Banco Comercial de Macau.</p>
<p>Banco Espirito Santo Do Oriente (BESOR), a subsidiary of Banco Espirito Santo, Portugal's third largest private bank, opened for business in Macau last September, mainly dealing with investment banking and consulting.</p>
<p>BES president Ricardo Espirito Santo Salgado, who joined Sampaio's delegation, told Reuters earlier this month that BESOR could take part in projects in partnership with Chinese capital.</p>
<p>Portuguese electricity company EDP has opened an office in Macau which it uses to seek investment opportunities in China. EDP manages Macau utility Companhia de Electricidade de Macau and holds a five percent stake.</p>
<p>Diario de Noticias newspaper reported on Monday that some 10 Portuguese companies, with Chinese partners, had invested more than five billion escudos ($29 million) in various projects at an industrial park in Kaifeng in Henan province.</p>
<p>Portuguese officials will discuss gambling revenues, which represent 60 percent of the income of the Macau government, and the future of the Fundacao Oriente educational foundation with Chinese officials during Sampaio's visit, Caramelo said.</p>
<p>Portugal's annual trade with China amounts to no more than $250 million, most of it Chinese exports.</p>
