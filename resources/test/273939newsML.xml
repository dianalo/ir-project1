<p>Airbus Industrie declined comment on Monday on a German newspaper report that the aircraft consortium would change into a joint stock company under French law by 1999.</p>
<p>An Airbus spokesman said the report, carried on the weekend by Sueddeutsche Zeitung, was "speculation." He added, "The decision can only come from the partners collectively. We have to wait for their decision."</p>
<p>The German report said Gustav Humbert, who heads the management at Daimler-Benz Aerospace Airbus, expected the change in status within two years.</p>
<p>Shares in  British Aerospace Plc, an Airbus partner, rose in London, on the German report on the view that if Airbus were re-organised into a joint stock company, BAe would be more attractive.</p>
<p>Last week another German publication, Der Spiegel, said the Airbus supervisory board would agree a compromise restructuring plan on January 3. The Airbus partners are negotiating over a change in its legal status from the present unwieldy partnership structure into a single integrated company, to compete better against U.S. archrival Boeing, which is merging with McDonnell Douglas.</p>
<p>But the talks, which were supposed to have led to an agreement by the end of this year, have stalled on the different views on the future Airbus.</p>
<p>The British and German partners want a stronger design and manufacturing role, while Aerospatiale wants largely to keep the present scope of operations.</p>
<p>Airbus Industrie is a consortium made up of French state-owned Ste Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.</p>
