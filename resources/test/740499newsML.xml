<p>Asian dollar deposit rates were quietly steady in moderate trade on Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Most traders were sidelined before tonight's release of the U.S. May international trade and July University of Michigan consumer sentiment data, they said.</p>
<p>International trade for May is forecast to show a deficit of US$9.18 billion compared with a deficit of $8.36 billion reported in April.</p>
<p>The University of Michigan consumer credit for July is expected to show a reading of 104.6 against June's 104.5.  </p>
<p>"Rates were steady to a little bit softer in the morning on some position adjustments. Some people are waiting for fresh clues to market direction from tonight's release of the international trade and University of Michigan consumer sentiment figures for more clues to market direction," a local dealer said.</p>
<p>"But I don't think there will be much impact on the market as most people have squared their positions for the weekend and the numbers have built into the market," he said.  </p>
<p>In day-to-day rates, weekend and Monday/Tuesday eased 1/16 percentage point each to a common 5-1/2 5-3/8 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Week-fixed eased 1/16 point to 5-9/16 5-7/16 percent.</p>
<p>Among term rates, one-month was unchanged from Thursday's 5-5/8 5-1/2 percent, three-months eased 1/16 point to 5-11/16 5-9/16, six-months eased 1/16 point to 5-13/16 5-11/16 and twelve-months was unchanged at 6-1/16 5-15/16 percent.</p>
