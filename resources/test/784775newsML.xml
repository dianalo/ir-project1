<p>Mexican conglomerate Grupo Carso bought a three percent stake in Apple Computer Inc, a source close to the group told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Grupo Carso acquired (the stake) for $60 million at a share price of $16," the source said, but declined to give a date for the transaction. The source declined to be identified.</p>
<p>The source added that early gains by Carso Global Telecom (CGT), a holding company with links to Grupo Carso, "had absolutely nothing to do" with the Apple deal.</p>
<p>Dealers said shares listed by Grupo Carso and CGT had gained sharply in early trade on press reports of the acquisition of the stake in Apple.</p>
<p>CGT shares had trimmed earlier gains but were still ahead 1.00 pesos at 34.00 at midday trade. Grupo Carso was meanwhile up 1.20 pesos at 63.50.</p>
