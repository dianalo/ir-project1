<p>Ireland's finance minister Charlie McCreevy on Thursday welcomed an economic review of the Irish economy which forecast economic growth at 7.4 percent in 1997 and inflation at a moderate two percent on average.</p>
<p>In an annual economic review and outlook, published on Thursday, the Department of Finance forecast gross domestic product (GDP) growth at 7.4 percent and gross national product (GNP) at 6.5 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>"The projected maintenance of low inflation, the lower General Government Deficit now emerging, the further rise of 50,000 in employment forecast ... are particularly welcome," Finance Minister McCreevy said in a statement.</p>
<p>He said the low inflation and general government deficit figures were "especially important in the run-up to (European) economic and monetary union".</p>
<p>The review expected employment to show an increase of more than 50,000 jobs in 1997, while average unemployment was seen falling by 10,000.</p>
<p>Consumer demand was expected to remain buoyant and consumer spending was expected to increase by 6.2 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>The review expected Ireland's general government deficit to undershoot its January Budget target, coming at around 0.7 percent of GDP, based on end-June Exchequer Returns.</p>
<p>Fixed investment was projected to grow strongly in 1997, supported by high levels of business confidence, EU receipts, and continued low interest rates.</p>
<p>Exports were expected to strengthen in response to a recovery in export markets and increased capacity, particularly in the high technology sectors.</p>
<p>The review said the current account of the balance of payments was expected to remain in surplus but warned that budget policy must not further add to inflationary pressures.</p>
