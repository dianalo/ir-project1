<p>The share price for computer giant Acer Inc soared in late trade on Thursday as recent depreciation of the Taiwan dollar against its U.S. counterpart boosted market confidence on the company's sales to the U.S., brokers said.</p>
<p>With 45 minutes left, Acer was up 5.56 percent or T$3 to T$57. Trade volume was the session's single heaviest at 81.33 million shares.</p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar has fallen sharply in recent days against the American currency due to the greenback's strength in overseas markets.  </p>
<p>"The depreciation is seen to help companies that export heavily to the U.S., and Acer is one of them," said Chen Han-chung, an analyst for Yungli Securities.</p>
<p>The U.S. is Acer's largest export market.</p>
