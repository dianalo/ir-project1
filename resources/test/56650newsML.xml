<p>An Asian was killed in an arson attack on two stores in a Bahraini village, local newspapers reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The newspapers said the attack took place on Saturday night in Nuwaidrat village, 10 km (six miles) south of the capital Manama.</p>
<p>"A number of people attacked two stores, set them on fire and fled the area. An Asian worker received serious injuries and later died in hospital," the report published by the papers said without naming the victim or giving his nationality.</p>
<p>The newspapers said one of the establishments was a photo studio and the other was a spare parts shop.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack or whether it was linked to anti-government protests which began in Bahrain in December 1994.</p>
<p>Members of Bahrain's Shi'ite Moslem community have carried out waves of arson attacks, bombings and protests to demand economic and political reform in Bahrain, the Gulf's banking and financial centre.</p>
