<p>Vitatron Inc said Monday the first U.S. implant was completed of its Diamond II pacemaker which is designed to improve a patient's exercise tolerance.</p>
<p>The Diamond II, a dual-sensor, dual-chamber pacemaker in clinical testing, provides a steady, stable heartbeat even if the heart tends to beat erratically or too fast.</p>
<p>The Diamond II was implanted at the Munroe Regional Medical Center in Ocala, Fla. The heart rate of the patient, a 65-year-old male, did not adequately increase to meet the patient's needs when exercising. The patient is reported to be recovering normally, Vitatron said in a statement.</p>
<p>The new pacemaker, introduced by Vitatron in Europe last May, is designed to provide greater implant flexibility with a size, at only 25 grams, that is 36 percent smaller than its predecessor, the Vitatron Diamond.</p>
<p>The Diamond II pacemaker was developed by Vitatron Medical B.V., a Dutch subsidiary of Medtronic Inc. Upon clearance by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for commercial release, the Diamond II will be marketed in the United States by the salesforce of Vitatron Inc U.S.A..</p>
