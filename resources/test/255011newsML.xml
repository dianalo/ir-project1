<p>A spokeswoman for Aon Corp declined to comment on Friday about rumors the insurance broking company was bidding for Britain's Sedgwick Group Plc but said Aon needed to "digest" two recent purchases.</p>
<p>"We don't comment on rumors, but we've got to digest the acquisitions we've made," Joan Steel, the spokeswoman for the Chicago company, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"These are two major investments and we've got to put them together."</p>
<p>Market talk has speculated that Aon or Marsh &amp; McLennan Cos Inc would bid for Sedgwick.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for Sedgwick and Marsh &amp; McLennan also declined to comment about the rumors.</p>
<p>Aon recently announced a $1.23 billion acquisition of Alexander &amp; Alexander Services Inc and two months ago bought British broker Bain Hogg Group for $253 million.</p>
