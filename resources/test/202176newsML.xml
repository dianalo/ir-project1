<title>SOUTH AFRICA: Mediation bid to end South African truckers' strike.</title>
<headline>Mediation bid to end South African truckers' strike.</headline>
<dateline>JOHANNESBURG 1996-11-20</dateline>

<p>Mediation aimed at resolving a national trucking strike by around 36,000 workers across South Africa continued late into the night on Wednesday as negotiators sought to resolve a wage dispute.</p>
<p>"Mediation still going on," Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) national organiser Thulani Dlamini told Reuters at about 10.20 p.m. on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The strike kicked off on Wednesday morning and spread to all sectors of the South African economy by the afternoon, said employer spokesman Johan van der Walt.  </p>
<p>"The strike is widespread with some companies at a complete standstill while others are still running...it has affected sectors across-the-board," said van der Walt, who is chairman of the Road Freight Association.</p>
<p>Truckers went on strike after a last-minute attempt by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) -- set up under the new Labour Relations Act -- to mediate failed on Tuesday night. The CCMA is a vehicle for dispute resolution that provides statutory dispute resolution services.</p>
<p>A TGWU spokesman said workers had originally demanded 14 to 18 percent across-the-board, but the union was seeking members' mandate on a 10 percent offer from employers.</p>
<p>Sectors of the economy affected by the strike include banking, air freight, waste companies, livestock vehicles, and the ferrying of chemicals and fuels.</p>
<p>This is the first time in 50 years that unions organised in the sector have resorted to industrial action.</p>
