<p>A joint Sudanese rebel group said on Wednesday its forces were advancing on the southern Blue Nile city of Damazin, which has a hydro-electric station supplying the Sudanese capital Khartoum with most of its power.</p>
<p>Yassir Arman, spokesman of the Southern Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), the biggest faction in the rebel National Democratic Alliance (NDA), told Reuters the rebels were within 80 km (50 miles) of Damazin and still advancing.  </p>
<p>Arman hailed the latest rebel advance, which has seen two border towns and key garrisons captured since Sunday, as a turning point in the 13-year war against Khartoum. He said the objective was to pile economic and military pressure on Sudan.</p>
<p>"Our forces are advancing on Damazin. We are now 80 km away from Damazin and still moving," Arman said.</p>
<p>"This operation is to enable the mass movement inside Sudan to wage an uprising against the military junta there. By advancing on Damazin we are piling economic and military pressure on the junta," Arman added.</p>
<p>Arman said the rebels had captured almost the whole of the southern Blue Nile region except for Damazin and Maban. He said the rebels entered Maban early on Wednesday morning and heavy fighting was raging there.</p>
