<p>German diversified industrial group Preussag AG said on Wednesday it had no interest in forming a German steel giant with the merged operations of rivals Krupp and Thyssen.</p>
<p>Preussage Stahl AG had nothing to fear from the steel venture Thyssen AG and Fried. Krupp AG Krupp-Hoesch agreed to form, Preussag chief Michael Frenzel said at the company's annual meeting.</p>
<p>"Size alone is no advantage," he said in response to questions from shareholders. Preussag was well positioned with its market share and there was no internal logic for joining a German steel combine, he added.</p>
<p>He also said Preussag's steel subsidiary would benefit from the reduction in German steel capacity that the Thyssen-Krupp merger would bring.</p>
