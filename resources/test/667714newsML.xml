<p>A unit of India's Essar group said on Tuesday that a fire in an office building in central New Delhi had knocked out its cellular telephone service but it hoped it would be restored soon.</p>
<p>Peter Stok, director of marketing for Essar unit Sterling Cellular Ltd, said its cellular phone network was shut down at 10:30 a.m. (0500 GMT) when power in the Chandralok Building of New Delhi's Connaught Place business district was cut off.</p>
<p>Two floors of the building were gutted in the fire, which raged for some six hours before it was extinguished.</p>
<p>"We have just been allowed into the building, and can't say when the network will be up," Stok told Reuters by telephone. "We are working to have it up by the evening, but I can't say for sure."</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, an Essar official who asked not to be identified said service had been restored.</p>
<p>Essar is the majority shareholder in Sterling Cellular, which has been granted licences to provide cellular telephone services in Delhi and three other zones.</p>
<p>Essar's partner is Swiss Telecom PTT, which was recently authorised to raise its stake in Sterling to 32.65 percent from 30.</p>
<p>Stok said that Sterling's exchange, located on the second floor, had not been damaged, but there was a possibility that cables leading to wireless equipment on the roof had been damaged.</p>
<p>"All efforts are being made to get the network back up, and we have replacement components standing by in case there is any damage to the network," he said.</p>
<p>He did not say how much business the company had lost due to the fire, but said that the average subscriber bill for airtime was 900 rupees ($25) a month. ($1 = 35.8 rupees)</p>
