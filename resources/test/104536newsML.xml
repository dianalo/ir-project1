<p>Seiler Pollution Control Systems Inc won a $300,000 contract to continue a project that studies turning hazardous industrial wastes into glass ceramics, vice president Alan Sarko said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lab testing has been completed, and phase two of the project will include preliminary engineering design and cost estimates for a pilot Seiler system in Ohio, he said.</p>
<p>It is funded by Ohio's Edison Materials Technology Center, which combines industry, academic and government research efforts to study hazardous waste and other industrial issues and to foment new technologies. Ohio has eight such technology centers, funded by the state and private industry.</p>
<p>Based on technology developed in Switzerland, Seiler's patented high-temperature system converts toxic and hazardous waste products such as paint sludge and lead waste into glass ceramics usable by industry, Sarko said.</p>
<p>"Seiler already demonstrated through laboratory tests using our process that a variety of hazardous wastes could be successfully vitrified and transformed into nonhazardous forms such as beads, granules, chunks and other shapes which, in turn, could be made into commercially viable products," he said.</p>
<p>Seiler said the project team includes Ohio State University, two gas companies, a steelmaker and an automaker.</p>
<p>Seiler is also conducting a project for the U.S. Air Force to study converting waste water sludge, paint sludge and sandblasting residue into usable abrasives, Sarko said. Lab testing was completed in Switzerland and Seiler is now studying sites for installation of a test system, he said.</p>
