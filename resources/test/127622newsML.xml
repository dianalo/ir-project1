<p>Republican Bob Dole has taken the gloves off in his last-ditch battle to catch up with President Bill Clinton, adding a new charge of Democratic "money laundering" to a list of alleged ethical misdeeds.</p>
<p>With 18 days to go before the election, Dole planned a grueling schedule of rallies on Friday here, in Wichita, Kansas, and in Denver before stopping for the night in London, Kentucky.</p>
<p>He arrived here from California where he concluded a four-day trip on Thursday, demonstrating his aggressive new style. Dole said in effect, 'no more Mr. Nice Guy,' by heeding his advisers who had urged him to get tough in a go-for-broke effort to come from behind and win the election.</p>
<p>The question remained whether his aggressive style will attract or turn off voters. Some advisers fear it will remind undecided voters of the Dole image of old, the hard-edged "hatchet man" first etched in 1976.</p>
<p>That was when, as the vice presidential running mate with then-President Gerald Ford, he referred to "Democrat wars" for this century's wartime deaths and casualties.</p>
<p>Dole's get-tough strategy was evident in the final debate with Clinton on Wednesday in San Diego.</p>
<p>Post-debate polls gave the debate to Clinton but Dole national chairman Donald Rumsfeld, a former Defence Secretary, attributed the losing debate polls to instant reactions by people who dislike critical attacks. Talking to reporters, he predicted that in a few days Dole would pick up support from the debate.</p>
<p>"We're going to get tough," Dole said in Riverside, California, to a partisan audience Thursday. "You haven't seen anything yet."</p>
<p>Then during rallies in Riverside and in Glendale, California, before flying here, Dole accused Clinton of being soft on illegal immigration and drug imports, breaking 1992 campaign promises for a middle-class tax cut and for leading a party that has accepted what he said were improper donations and "money laundering" of foreign funds.</p>
<p>This last charge was a revved-up version of his criticism of reports of hundred thousand dollars in contributions to the Democratic Party -- not to Clinton's campaign directly -- of money from people associated with the giant Lippo Group banking combine in Indonesia.</p>
<p>At one rally he told the crowd that the United States was getting "foreign aid" from Indonesia interests.</p>
<p>He also assailed a fundraiser attended by Vice President Al Gore at a Buddhist temple last April near Los Angeles -- where members take vows of poverty -- but where Dole said Democrats got thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>"The next thing is they'll have a fundraiser at a homeless shelter," said Dole of the reports of the Buddhist temple money-raising.</p>
<p>In Glendale, California, he said people involved in the Buddhist affair reportedly were Taiwanese -- "somebody brought in the cash" and somebody passed it on. "That's called money laundering, and they've done so much of it they've got a laundromat next to the vice president's house in Washington, D.C," he said.</p>
<p>The Dole campaign announced it will make a major effort to win California, the nation's biggest state with 54 electoral votes out of the 270 a candidate needs to win the presidency.</p>
<p>Dole campaign manager Scott Reed told reporters the campaign would spend "in the millions" in ads to win California without giving details.</p>
<p>California Attorney General Dan Lundgren told reporters that the Dole campaign had promised 20 appearances by Dole, running mate Jack Kemp and Dole's wife, Elizabeth, until Election Day on Nov. 5.</p>
<p>Reed said the campaign has $25 million left and state parties have about $30 million, which campaign aides estimated was more than the Clinton campaign.</p>
