<p>Shares in consumer electronics firm Daewoo Electronics SA Ltd lost almost 23 percent on Tuesday after the company said it would post a significant loss in the half year to June.</p>
<p>Its shares finished at 230 cents each -- down 68 cents or 22.8 percent from Monday's close after almost one million shares worth 2.33 million rand changed hands in 52 deals.</p>
<p>The company announced earlier that its results would be hit by high interest rates, delayed purchases of large household electrical goods and a flood of illegal imports.</p>
<p>"Market conditions in the consumer electronics industry have proved to be weaker than anticipated," the firm said.</p>
<p>"Shareholders are advised that, in respect of the interim results, a significant loss will be attributable to shareholders," it said.</p>
<p>The firm warned in its annual chairman's statement that the year ahead would be difficult to forecast and unlikely to improve much before the second half of the year.</p>
<p>It had expected some of its losses in the period to be offset by a refund of duty paid since November, 1995, on imported satellite receivers.</p>
<p>"An application was made to the Commissioner for Customs and Excise to correct the determination that ad valorem duty was payable on satellite receivers and on May 19 Daewoo received written notification from Customs and Excise that satellite receivers were not subject to the payment of ad valorem duties," it said.</p>
<p>Daewoo then submitted a claim and a request for a refund of 13.3 million rand, of which 4.6 million rand related to the first six months of 1997.</p>
<p>"However, on July 4, Daewoo received a second letter from Customs and Excise which stated that the decision conveyed in the letter of May 19 was withdrawn and that the satellite receivers were subject to the payment of ad valorem duties," it said.</p>
<p>Daewoo said it was taking legal advice on pursuing the claim further.</p>
<p>The group said it could not yet comment on prospects for the full year and warned the legal fight with customs could knock satellite receiver sales in the second half as it would interfere with pricing and costing.</p>
<p>The firm warned its shareholders to exercise caution when dealing in its shares until its interim results are published later in August.</p>
