<p>Maine Gov. Angus King said he is willing to consider reforms to help injured workers, but would not support any major changes to the state's workers compensation laws.</p>
<p>King said the current system of representation of injured workers before the workers compensation board could be expanded and improved.</p>
<p>He said the pressure should be put on the board to improve the system. The governor says if that if the board does not, he will consider introducing legislation next January.</p>
