<p>Trade on the Latvian stock exchange was buoyant on Friday although several stocks took a tumble, leading to a fall in bank indices tracking the market.</p>

<p>Leading blue chip Unibanka, expected to release its 1996 audited results on Monday, was stable at 4.46 lats, also stalling a bull run that took it higher at the start of the week. It showed the highest market trade of 94,100 lats.</p>
