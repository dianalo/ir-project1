<p>Romanian women are encountering tougher workplace challenges than in the communist era, including sexual harassment, according to a research study made available on Thursday.</p>
<p>The study conducted for the Labour Ministry said sexual harassment had become a problem for women in the workplace as the Balkan country abandoned Communist work ethics and relapsed to traditional macho ways.</p>
<p>"We found attempts to exclude women from labour markets," Gabriela Tudose said of the study of 1,600 women she and other social workers conducted. "Harassment is one way to do it."</p>
<p>Since the fall of communism in 1989, the status of women has altered considerably as the tenet of "equality of the sexes" ceased to be a state dogma.</p>
<p>But also gone is the limited protection afforded by official trade unions and ubiquitous Communist Party organisations. Women no longer have redress for sexual aggression at the workplace.</p>
<p>Only 28 percent of respondents, both in and out of work, answered the "harassment" section of the questionnaire.</p>
<p>"The study showed that most women think sexual harassment means only rape or attempted rape," said Maria Topor, who led the study team. "Harassment starts where pleasure ends."</p>
<p>Leering glances topped a list of sexual harassment complaints, with 37.4 percent of women admitting they had been the object of embarrassing attentions at the workplace. Insinuating remarks came second on 21.9 percent.</p>
<p>Only 10.1 percent said their bosses had linked employment prospects to sexual favours. Still fewer, 2.3 percent, said they had been sexually molested by employers.</p>
<p>"One reason may be fear, embarrassment another," Topor said. "Sexual aspects appear both with hirings and layoffs. In many cases, refusing can mean being fired."</p>
<p>The post-communist criminal code makes no reference to sexual harassment. "We lack laws and institutions to protect women against harassment. Only rape can be prosecuted. It's difficult to gauge the size of the phenomenon," Tudose said.</p>
<p>Researchers said harassment took more banal forms, like job descriptions in labour exchanges seeking, for instance, "Tall, slim woman, under 20, wanted as cook."</p>
<p>Romanian women also bore the brunt of economic collapse, they said, and tended to be the first made redundant as the economy adjusts to market reforms and industry is slimmed down.</p>
<p>But employment rates remain high, with 42 percent of Romanian women aged 15 to 55 in full-time jobs, whereas Western women tend to work part-time.</p>
