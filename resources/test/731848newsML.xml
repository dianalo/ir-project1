<headline>Romania leu closes flat, money market inches down.</headline>
<text>
<p>1340 GMT - The Romanian leu closed flat at 7,100/150 to the dollar on Wednesday in a calm interbank market, traders said.</p>
<p>* They said the leu-dollar rates would stay stable on Thursday with central bank (BNR) continuing to drain excess dollars to prevent the leu from firming. Dollar funds in excess originate from recent massive foreign inflows in Romanian equities.</p>
<p>* On the money market, short term rates inched down below 50 percent due to higher liquidity. Traders said overliquidity came through BNR dollar purchases on the local foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>* They expected short-term rates to slip further on Thursday if the BNR launched no intervention to take deposits from commercial banks.</p>
<p>* Leu-dollar retail rates inched down to 7,050/7,100.</p>
