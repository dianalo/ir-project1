<p>Taiwan stocks closed higher on Saturday as some investors chased prices to try to lift the market out of its week-long consolidation, brokers said.</p>
<p>The weighted index ended 47.08 points or 0.72 percent higher at 6,625.44. Turnover was an active T$48.95 billion in Saturday's truncated session.</p>
<p>The market, trapped by psychological resistance, has stagnated since it reached a 19-month peak on October 5. "But a technical stall like that can't last forever, and it's only a matter of time before investors want to push for a higher upside," said Wang Jieh of Foremost Investment.  </p>
<p>Electronics continued to rally from Tuesday's news that semiconductor book-to-bill figures for the United States climbed to a new year high in September. The sector gained 0.93 percent, with Shamrock Technology soaring by the daily seven percent limit or T$2.70 to T$41.70 in its second bounce after Friday's listing.</p>
<p>Brokers forecast a sound outlook for the market, with healthy profit results expected for blue-chip firms as the October 31 deadline for releasing the results of the first three quarters aproaches.  </p>
<p>"The pace of rise will not be drastic, but a steady uptrend is likely from now until the end of the month," Wang said.</p>
<p>A 6,590-6,650 range was seen for Monday.</p>
