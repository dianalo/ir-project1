<p>AC Milan coach Arrigo Sacchi, appealed to supporters on Tuesday to help the struggling Italian champions and avoid rowdy behaviour.</p>
<p>"I'll be frank," the former Italy coach told a news conference. "For the final weeks of the season I'm asking all the fans to help: I don't want them to join the rabble."</p>
<p>Angry Milan fans bombarded their team's goal with flares, bottles and smoke bombs on Sunday when city rivals Inter took a 3-0 lead against Milan at San Siro.</p>
<p>The trouble could cost the club, beaten the previous week 6-1 by league leaders Juventus, heavily in fines.</p>
<p>Club chairman Silvio Berlusconi said later that the incidents were "rude and unworthy of a club that dominated the world for 10 years and has given great satisfaction to true fans.</p>
<p>"On Sunday the fans were rude and uncouth."</p>
<p>Sacchi, who took over as coach late last year after Uruguayan Oscar Washington Tabarez resigned, defended his players and said they deserved better.</p>
<p>"This club and these players have defined the most triumphant nine years in the history of Milan and maybe of soccer, and they deserve respect.</p>
<p>"Those who love Milan should show it now."</p>
<p>Milan, three times winners of the European Cup in the last decade and with four league titles in the past five years, are 12th in the league and fighting for a place in Europe.</p>
<p>Sacchi refused to comment on his future at the club, despite persistent rumours that Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello is poised to return to his former employers.</p>
<p>"I'm not interested in rumours and hearsay," Sacchi said.</p>
<p>Newspapers, reporting that Capello was likely to meet Berlusconi in Milan next week during a holiday in Italy, quoted him as saying on Tuesday that Capello would decide his own future and doubted he would return to Milan soon.</p>
<p>"I don't think Capello will leave Madrid if they win the title and have the chance of the European Cup," he said.</p>
<p>Berlusconi added that he had no need to confirm Sacchi in his job because he had a signed contract.</p>
