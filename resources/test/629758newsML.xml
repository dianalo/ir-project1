<p>Innkeepers USA Trust said on Monday it had signed a $127.7 million agreement to acquire 10 hotels from privately held Summerfield Hotel Corp.</p>
<p>As part of the transaction, Innkeepers will adopt a multi-tenant leasing structure with Summerfield becoming an unaffiliated lessee, Innkeepers said in a statement.</p>
<p>Innkeepers also said it expected the acquisition to be accretive to funds from operations per share and to further contribute to FFO per share growth in 1998 and future years.</p>
<p>"The acquisition is a natural extension of our upscale exntended stay strategy," said Innkeepers chief operating officer Fred Shaw. "These hotels compete more with upscale full-service hotels than any other extended stay hotels in the marketplace."</p>
<p>Innkeepers USA Trust, based in Palm Beach, Fla., is an owner of Residence Inns by Marriott.</p>
