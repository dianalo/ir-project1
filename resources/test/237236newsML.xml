<title>USA: CBOT wheat ends mostly up on delivery market.</title>
<headline>CBOT wheat ends mostly up on delivery market.</headline>

<p>CBOT wheat futures closed mostly higher led by nearby December on talk that most of the wheat posted Thursday for delivery on that month was stopped by domestic mills, traders said.</p>
<p>"That's the talk down here but the December is pretty risky right now," a trader said.</p>
<p>The CBOT December contracts are trading without limits because they are in delivery status and slated to expire on December 19.</p>
<p>There were 750,000 bushels posted Thursday for delivery and nearly 600,000 were seen stopped by commercials accounts.</p>
<p>Traders also said there was talk Egypt Saturday would be tendering for 300,000 to 500,000 tonnes of optional-origin wheat and there were hopes the U.S. may land some of the business.</p>
<p>But U.S. exporters doubted whether the U.S. would realize any of the business and said Egypt probably would be in the market for only slightly more than 50,000 tonnes, the amount for which that country said it was inviting bids.</p>
<p>Wheat closed 6-1/2 cents per bushel higher to 2-1/2 lower, with December up 6-1/2 at $3.84-3/4 and March was up 5-1/4 at $3.75-1/2.</p>
