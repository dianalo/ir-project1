<p>Tajikistan government and opposition officials met in Tehran on Wednesday for talks on achieving peace in the turbulent Central Asian country, the Iranian news agency IRNA said.</p>
<p>Tajik Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarov, deputy Islamist opposition leader Akbar Torajonzoda and the United Nations special envoy on Tajikistan, Gerd Merrem, took part in the talks, it said.</p>
<p>The talks, the latest in a series of peace negotiations, will focus on ways of legalising opposition organisations, officials from both sides have said.</p>
<p>Observers from Iran, Russia, Pakistan and Uzbekistan were attending the talks which were expected to last 10 days, IRNA said.</p>
<p>A military deal was agreed last month in Moscow between the main protagonists in the four-year civil war. A four-month-old ceasefire appears to be holding.</p>
<p>In February, the government and the opposition hailed a preliminary power-sharing agreement reached after talks in Iran which gave each side an equal number of seats on a 26-member National Commission for Reconciliation.</p>
<p>The commission was limited to members of the government and the Islamic opposition. Diplomats fear the commission could sideline other groups, although legalisation of opposition political parties would give them a greater voice.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands lost their lives in the bloody civil war and many more were made homeless in the remote mountainous republic of 5.7 million people.</p>
