<p>Most U.S. mortgage-backed securities traded modestly higher on Wednesday, getting their lift from buyers of Ginnie Mae paper, mortgage experts said.</p>
<p>Yield spreads to Treasuries were unchanged to slightly tighter and trading volume was relatively thin, they said.</p>
<p>"Mortgage bankers were selling a little bit and there was (some) buying of Ginnie 8.0s," said one trader at a large U.S. investment firm. He said the buying of Ginnie paper amounted to about $150 million.</p>
<p>Other market participants said mortgage activity was at a virtual standstill.  </p>
<p>"It's been very quiet today. The only thing that's been going on is (the) buying of Ginnie 8.0s," another trader added.</p>
<p>In pass-throughs, Ginnie Mae 30-year 7.5-percent coupons were up 2/32 at 99-02/32, yielding 95 basis points over the 10-year Treasury note.</p>
<p>Comparable Fannie Mae was up 2/32 at 99-03/32, and Freddie Mac issues were up 1/32 at 99-07/32.</p>
<p>The five-year note was off 2/32 at 6.65 percent, while the 10-year note was down 1/32 to yield 6.80 percent.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury auctioned about $16.5 billion of two-year notes at a high yield of 6.328 percent.</p>
