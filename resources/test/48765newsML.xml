<p>London platinum fixed at $390.00 an ounce on Thursday, the lowest since July 11, 1996.</p>

<p>London platinum fixes at two-month low =2</p>
<p>Sentiment in the platinum market has been bearish in recent weeks amid a lack of buying interest from consumers and investors. Platinum is used primarily in the jewellery and auto industries.</p>
<p>Gold prices were also weaker at $382.35 an ounce, down more than a $1.00 from Wednesday's London close.</p>
<p>Gold has been under selling pressure in recent weeks, but market jitters have intensified ahead of a Friday International Monetary Fund meeting to discuss a plan to sell part of the IMF gold reserve to help aid poor countries.</p>
<p>Several bullion market analysts said a price dip towards a 2 1/2 month low of $380 was likely.</p>
