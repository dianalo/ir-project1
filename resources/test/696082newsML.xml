<p>The red flag of China flew over the former British military headquarters, the Prince of Wales Barracks, in Hong Kong on Tuesday morning after the People's Liberation Army took control.</p>
<p>"The Chinese soldiers are standing guard at the gates. The Chinese flag is flying," Reuter correspondent Kurt Schork reported from the scene shortly after the British colony was handed back to China at midnight (1600 GMT) on Monday.  </p>
<p>He said all the British forces had left the barracks and China's soldiers were now standing guard.</p>
<p>There was a brief colour guard in the entrance to the barracks -- six men each from the army, navy and air force.</p>
<p>At midnight the British in dress uniforms marched out in formation and boarded a patrol boat.</p>
