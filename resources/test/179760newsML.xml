<p>South African stocks tumbled on Monday on a bleak outlook on exchange control abolition and a presistently high money market shortage, fuelling fears of a rate hike, dealers said.</p>
<p>Industrial stocks were hardest hit with the index diving over one percent as futures arbitrage players sold off stock in the spot market.</p>
<p>The high shortage, stubbornly holding above the nine billion rand level, was seen making a hike in the central Bank rate and commercial banks' prime rate inevitable, sooner or later.</p>
<p>The latest on exchange controls came from Central Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals who on Friday told Reuters abolition would be a gradual process which could take four to five years.</p>
<p>Dealers said this was in the long term detrimental to the rand as it would invite speculation which in turn was damaging to the equity market, keeping foreigners out.</p>
<p>Traders said futures players had sold off stock in the spot market taking advantage of contracts' discount to fair value. At the same time, futures were sold off as the same negative factors as beset the spot market, weighed on futures.</p>
<p>They said volumes had been thin, exaggerating the fall.</p>
<p>A recent batch of poor corporate results, notably from subidiaries of heavyweight stock SAB, depressed the stock market further, with the outlook for SAB's half year results due on Wednesday not so rosy, dealers said.</p>
<p>The industrial index shed 99.9 points to 7,891.9 lopping 60.8 points off the all share index which finished at 6,732.7.</p>
<p>On the gold board, a slightly firmer bullion price could not offset the market's overall pessimism leaving the index 2.3 points weaker at 1,678.8.</p>
