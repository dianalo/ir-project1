<p>Polish construction firm Espebepe SA tumbled 9.6 percent to 5.15 zlotys after Thursday's news the largest creditor of the debt-ridden builder is against the debt-restructuring deal it proposed, traders said.</p>
<p>Espebepe, which fell 9.5 percent on Thursday before the news, wants its largest creditors to write off 95 percent of its 75-million-zloty debt and then issue new shares to them at five zlotys each.</p>
<p>Pomorski Bank Kredytowy SA (PBKS) is the largest of the firm's creditors, which are due to meet on May 16 to discuss the possible deal.</p>
<p>PBKS earlier proposed a 40-percent write-off of debts and a convertible bond issue in exchange for the remaining debt but Espebepe rejected the plan as too expensive and time-consuming.</p>
<p>Selling of the stock on Friday was strong enough after price-fixing to reduce players' bids.</p>
