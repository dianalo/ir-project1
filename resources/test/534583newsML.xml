<p>Bell Atlantic Corp Chief Executive Officer Raymond Smith said Thursday he does not expect the government to attach conditions to its proposed merger with NYNEX Corp.</p>
<p>Smith said he was confident the deal would be approved by the Department of Justice "very soon."</p>
<p>"No, we are not having discussions. I don't think there will be any (conditions)," he told reporters when asked if the company was holding discussions with the Justice Department.</p>
<p>"We expect very shortly to hear" from the government, he said in an address at a business breakfast here.  </p>
<p>"We don't think there is any basis to object to the merger," he said. "We are not current competitors; there has never been an anti-trust case of two people who aren't competitors today but might be someday."</p>
<p>He noted the Justice Department did not object to SBC Communications Inc's plans to buy Pacific Telecom Inc. Those two companies were also potential competitors, he said. "There has never been a case won on potential competition," he said.</p>
<p>Smith said Bell Atlantic would fight the government if it opposed the NYNEX deal.  </p>
<p>"Whether it is (approved) or not, we are going through with this merger," he said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Justice Department in Washington told Reuters when asked about Smith's comments, "Our investigation is continuing." She had no further comment.</p>
<p>Some observers believe the Justice Department, whose decision is expected to influence the Federal Communications Commission, will impose conditions on the proposed merger, including reduced rates for competitors wanting to use the combined companies' local network.  </p>
<p>The $23 billion merger, announced in April 1996, will create the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company, behind only long-distance giant AT&amp;T Corp.</p>
<p>Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic will complete upgrades to its network in the Philadephia area to include broadband capabilities by the end of this year, for use next year, Smith said. Digital capabilities will be available to the network in early 1999, he said.</p>
<p>NYNEX intends to have digital capabilities installed completely across Massachusetts by the end of the year, he said.</p>
