<p>Leisure and gaming company Ladbroke Group Plc said it has sold a freehold property in London to Minerva Plc for 37 million stg cash on completion.</p>
<p>The transaction is conditional on Minerva obtaining a full listing on the London Stock Exchange, which is expected to take place next month, Ladbroke said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The grade two listed building, at 27-37 Wigmore Street, is a mixed development consisting of office space fully let to a unit of Banque Paribas, retail space and 15 residential flats.</p>
<p>The book value of the property at December 31, 1995 was 41 million stg and the rental income for that year was 2.7 million stg.</p>
<p>Ladbroke said the proceeds of the sale would be used to reduce debt and for investment in the group's core businesses.</p>
