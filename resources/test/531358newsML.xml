<p>Britain's Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS), currently being stalked with a possible 1.2 billion pound ($2 billion) bid, is proving extremely difficult to value, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The breakdown of the businesses is not very clear and for the retail side, it could be quite hard to sell as nobody would want all of it," said one analyst who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>The Co-op turned in annual pre-tax profits of 54.1 million pounds when it reported last week, of which 45.5 million was from its highly successful banking operations.</p>
<p>Its food retail business comprises around 650 outlets of which some 60-70 are superstores and the rest smaller shops with around 14 million square feet of selling space in total.</p>
<p>That compares with Britain's leading supermarket group Tesco, which has just over 14 million square feet of selling space and arch-rival J. Sainsbury, which has around 10 million square feet in food stores.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Co-op's larger stores could prove attractive to some of Britain's supermarket chains but buyers were unlikely to want the entire package.</p>
<p>"Nobody would want all of it. Some of the larger sites could be interesting, as planning permissions are not so easy to obtain for new stores, but there is a surplus of small stores on the market now," the analyst said.</p>
<p>The Co-operative's turnover for 1996, excluding banking and insurance, was around three billion pounds.</p>
<p>Analysts said that other recent bids in the food retail sector have been pitched at 50-70 percent of turnover.</p>
<p>In March, Britain's leading supermarket chain Tesco paid 630 million pounds for the Irish stores of Associated British Foods (ABF), which have turnover of 1.3 billion pounds.</p>
<p>"But Galileo is looking at 1.2 billion pounds for the whole lot," the analyst said.</p>
<p>Galileo, set up to bid for the 153-year-old mutually-owned supermarkets to funeral parlour group by entrepeneur Andrew Regan, has been temporarily stopped from its bid by legal actions from the CWS.</p>
<p>Regan's aim is widely believed to be to buy CWS and then strip its assets, possibly selling off supermarkets to leading British chains such as Sainsbury.</p>
<p>Although Sainsbury has declined to comment on the reports, analysts said it could be tempted to 'cherry pick' attractive sites, particularly in Scotland and Ireland where it has fewer stores and the Co-op holds a good record.</p>
<p>"The Co-op has quite a few locations which could be interesting to big food retailers. Regan might have to auction off packages of stores which would be a very messy business," the analyst said.</p>
<p>Galileo, an offshoot of 31-year-old Regan's Guernsey-based investment trust Lanica, has not revealed any details of its ambitious plan to break open the labyrinthine structure of the Co-op.</p>
<p>But it has said it would propose a special meeting of the CWS to convert it into a limited company which it would then buy.</p>
<p>The Co-op's banking arm, Co-operative Bank Plc, known for its ethical and environmental stance, is the smallest of Britain's clearing banks.</p>
<p>Newspaper reports at the weekend put a price tag of around 300-400 million on this branch of the business and one banking sector analyst who asked not to be identified said a price of 250-300 million would be "about right" given recent comparable moves in the sector.</p>
<p>The Co-op's other businesses include its insurance arm, which has total assets of 12.8 billion pounds and total income of two billion annually.</p>
<p>It insures two million homes and 650,000 vehicles and has one of the largest customer bases in the industry.</p>
<p>The Co-op also has funeral parlours, opticians, chemists and travel agents.</p>
<p>"All one can say at this stage is that the Co-op is obviously worth hundreds, rather than tens, of millions," one analyst said.</p>
