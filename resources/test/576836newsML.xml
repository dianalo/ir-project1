<text>
<p>1445 GMT - Implied vol on dollar/yen options off early highs in Europe but remain more than a point higher than Friday's close. Spot steadies after dollar/yen collapse late last week and early Monday but it remains fragile below 119.00.</p>
<p>* Mark/yen vols continue to climb, however, as spot keeps sinking to lowest levels in almost a year. One-month vol in dollar/mark eases off highs and now well below dollar/yen equivalents. Stg/mark vol holds overnight gains despite spot bounce.</p>
<p>* One month dollar/yen at 11.00/11.50 pct off 11.30/11.75 pct earlier but up from 9.70/10.00 pct late Friday. Curve steeply inverted to one-year at 9.70/10.00 pct, but long end creeping up from early levels and from 9.40/9.60 late Friday.</p>
<p>* Demand for yen calls spirals higher with one-month 25 delta risk reversals now skewed to 1.1/1.6 in favour of yen calls vs dollar compared with 0.8/1.15 late last week.</p>
<p>* One-month mark/yen vol surges to to 9.60/9.90 pct vs 9.20/9.50 early today and 8.0/8.30 Friday. One-week off early highs but stil higher at 10.00/11.00 pct. Risk reversals show bias to yen calls vs mark up to 0.5/0.9 pct vs 0.3/0.6 Friday.</p>
<p>* Spot crashed through psychological 70.0 to 69.78, lowest level since May 1996. Further losses medium term have scope to 68.00, the lows from May last year.</p>
<p>* One-month sterling/mark at 9.60/10.10 pct vs 9.10/9.50 pct late Friday with spot stg in reversal. One-month risk reversal edges further in favour of stg puts to 0.4/0.9 pct.</p>
<p>* One-month dollar/mark off early highs and last at 8.75/9.00 vs 8.55/8.85 pct late Friday. Strong bounce in spot leaves focus on yen moves, with 1.70 in dollar/mark still a magnet. Risk-reversals edge out toward mark calls at 0.3/0.7 pct vs 0.2/0.45.</p>
