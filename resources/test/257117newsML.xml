<p>Armed police on Sunday morning surrounded a church in the heart of Geneva where a former Swiss army major feared by police to be deranged was holed up after shooting and wounding a priest and an altarboy.</p>
<p>The 52-year-old Swiss German from the town of Basel was still inside Notre Dame Roman Catholic Church nearly five hours after the attack at 7.30 p.m. (1830 GMT), police said.</p>
<p>Police said the priest and an altarboy were wounded when the gunman opened fire with a pistol inside the church soon after evening mass ended.</p>
<p>"He's deranged, we think. We've sent in psychologists. They're trying to calm him down," he added. "If dialogue doesn't work, we'll have to use force," said police spokesman Alexander Baerisswyl.</p>
<p>The two wounded were removed from the church together with worshippers. They were taken to hospital where police said their wounds were not serious.</p>
<p>Police and a psychologist entered into negotiations with the gunman by mobile telephone to persuade him to surrender.</p>
<p>"He's asked for a mobile phone. He's been making phonecall after phonecall. He's demanded to see our city's police chiefs -- in uniform," said Baerissmyl.</p>
<p>Policemen with sniffer dogs moved around the edge of the church, which is near Geneva's main train station and the four-star Hotel Cornavin, apparently searching for explosives.</p>
<p>Outside the church, about a dozen police officers wearing flak jackets, black masks and helmets trained their guns on the building.</p>
<p>Geneva residents were shocked by the attack, the first they could remember in their tranquil city.</p>
<p>"There's a gunman down the road, haven't you heard?," an elderly Swiss lady in a black coat shouted at passers-by in a nearby backstreet.</p>
<p>A young police officer told a group of movie-goers asking what had happened: "There's been shooting. Someone has been shooting."</p>
<p>Switzerland has compulsory military service for men and every able-bodied Swiss male has an assault weapon at home. Switzerland has a 400,000-man militia army.</p>
