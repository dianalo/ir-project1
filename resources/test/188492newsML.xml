<p>Topmakers quotations slipped as much as five pence per kilo with further falls thought to be likely.</p>
<p>Sterling's strength was said to be hampering the UK wool market as this makes overseas wool cheaper, with higher UK interest rates adding fuel to this particular fire.</p>
<p>However, at present deliveries are often said to be going out well and machinery was keeping active, brokers said.</p>
