<headline>Israel to sell 4 bln shekels of shares - Netanyahu.</headline>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said his government plans to sell more than four billion shekels ($1.2 billion) worth of shares in state companies this year.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said in an interview published in India's Economic Times newspaper on Tuesday that he was confident the government will meet its annual inflation target of seven to 10 percent in 1997, and its goal was to turn the shekel into a convertible currency.</p>
<p>"We are deregulating, slowing the growth of the bureaucracy, and intend to sell off government-controlled land to entrepreneurs," the Israeli leader said.</p>
<p>"The companies targeted for privatisation in 1997, according to our plans, are valued at more than four billion shekels."</p>
<p>Netanyahu said recent developments in Israel's economy pointed to a slowdown in activity, "discernible both in diminishing local demand and a decrease in the rate of export growth".</p>
<p>He noted that unemployment had increased in recent months to about seven percent from 6.4 percent, but that the annual inflation rate had dropped to seven percent in the second half of 1996 from about 15 percent in the first half.</p>
<p>"After achieving a more balanced fiscal policy, we have fixed an inflation target of seven to 10 percent for 1997, which I am sure we can meet," he said, adding that the current rate was about 9.5 percent.</p>
<p>The Israeli leader was asked what measures his government had initiated to "restore the flurry of economic activity evidenced in the early 1990s".</p>
<p>He said: "Having examined the results of the first quarter of 1997, we are discussing an additional cut to meet this year's deficit target. I'd like to emphasise that the Israeli economy is very strong, as its basic indicators prove."</p>
<p>Netanyahu did not elaborate on the additional cut.</p>
<p>The Israeli leader said the nation's trade deficit had declined in comparison with the first half of 1996. "I want to stress than despite the slowdown, we can expect an annual growth of at least five percent," he said, without indicating which economic indicator he had in mind.</p>
<p>Israel's gross domestic product grew by an annualised 2.8 percent in the first quarter of 1997 compared with 4.7 percent in the year-earlier period. The government has been forecasting full-year growth of four percent, down from 4.4 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said Israel's "strategic goal" was to turn the shekel into a convertible currency.</p>
<p>"To achieve this, we must substantially accelerate liberalisation in the money markets and the removal of foreign currency controls," he said. "We shall do this gradually and prudently."</p>
<p>Netanyahu said Israel invested more than $3 billion in infrastructure in 1995 and aimed to do much more.</p>
<p>He said Israel was particularly interested in encouraging investments in joint ventures with Jordan, whose prosperity, he said, "is vital for the continuation of the peace process".</p>
<p>The Israeli leader called the recent setbacks to the Middle East peace process temporary. "What will ultimately win the day is our common interest in peace and prosperity," he said.</p>
