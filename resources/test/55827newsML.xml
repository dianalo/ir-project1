<p>General Mills said Monday that its fiscal first quarter earnings fell 7 percent due to price cuts for its breakfast cereals despite somewhat higher sales.</p>
<p>The Minneapolis-based maker of Cheerios and Wheaties cereals, as well as Betty Crocker products, said its earnings fell to $127 million, or 80 cents a share before an accounting charge, from $137 million, or 86 cents the previous first quarter.</p>
<p>Sales for the fiscal first quarter ending Aug. 25 rose 3 percent to $1.32 billion.</p>
<p>In June, General Mills announced that it was lowering prices an average of 11 percent on brands representing 42 percent of its cereal volume. The company reiterated Monday that those price cuts were expected to reduce full-year fiscal 1997 sales by $100 million and net earnings by $30 million to $35 million, or 20 cents per share.</p>
<p>The company said that more than half of this earnings impact fell in the first quarter, and that the impact in future quarters will be less as reductions in promotional spending behind established brands take effect beginning in mid-October.</p>
<p>General Mills' rivals Kellogg Co., based in Battle Creek, Mich. and the Post Cereal division of New York-based Philip Morris Cos. Inc., also cut retail cereal prices in an attempt to revive sluggish growth rates.</p>
<p>"While the impact of recent cereal pricing actions will moderate the company's overall earnings progress in 1997, we continue to expect the vitality of our domestic non-cereal businesses and expanding international operations to generate good earnings gains for the year," said Steve Sanger, chairman of the company.</p>
<p>While domestic earnings fell, total domestic unit volume grew 3 percent in the quarter, the company said.</p>
<p>Earnings for General Mills' international operations, were also down in the first quarter, reflecting introductory market development costs for its International Dessert Partners joint venture with CPC International Inc. in Latin America, it said.</p>
