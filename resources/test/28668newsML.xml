<p>Athens stock exchange member firm</p>
<p>Sigma Securities led Greek brokers in August market share with</p>
<p>9.33 percent of the bourse's trading volume, followed by N.</p>
<p>Devletoglou with 9.31 percent, as was the case in July.</p>
<p>But August's pick up in volume unveiled rerankings as member</p>
<p>firms battled it out for market share.</p>
<p>Ranking third was National Securities, overtaking Alpha</p>
<p>Brokerage which saw its market share fold to 4.14 percent in</p>
<p>August from 6.11 percent in July.</p>
<p>Also losing market share were Omega and Telesis Securities</p>
<p>which gave up its fifth place to Kappa. Telesis saw its share</p>
<p>worsen to 3.80 percent in August, dropping to number seven.</p>
<p>Omega which ranked seventh in July also gave up market share</p>
<p>coming down to number nine.</p>
<p>Kappa Securities which launched operations in late April</p>
<p>improved its market share to 3.91 from 2.30 percent in July and</p>
<p>climbed to number five. It ranked 11th in July and 23rd in May.</p>
<p>Euroxx put out steady performance, holding on at number six</p>
<p>with 3.88 percent of the bourse's volume.</p>
<p>Trading volume in August improved to 288.6 billion drachmas,</p>
<p>up from 252.5 billion a month earlier. January remained the</p>
<p>bourse's best month so far this year with turnover hitting 428.8</p>
<p>billion drachmas and May the worst with 209 billion.</p>
<p>Cumulative January-August turnover reached 2.015 trillion</p>
<p>drachmas, the Athens stock exchange association of member</p>
<p>brokers (SMEHA) said.</p>
<p>Based on SMEHA's statistics 15 brokers out of the industry's</p>
<p>65 had 62.33 percent of the bourse's trading volume in August</p>
<p>compared to 60.45 percent in July.</p>
<p>The association's new 65th member, P &amp; K Securities, ranked</p>
<p>57th with 0.31 percent.</p>
