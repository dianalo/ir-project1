<p>The Spanish government said on Tuesday that it would no longer finance loss-making state-owned companies through the budget, but instead in 1997 would use funds from profitable state-owned groups and from the Treasury.</p>
<p>Funds required to finance these companies total 325 billion pesetas, Industry Minister Josep Pique said.</p>
<p>"This isn't a cut. It means that (the funds) aren't going to come from the budget," Pique told journalists.</p>
<p>Of the 325 billion pesetas, 200 billion will come from the profits or the privatisation earnings of profitable state-owned companies. The remaining 125 billion pesetas will be financed through the Treasury, Pique said.</p>
