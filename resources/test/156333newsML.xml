<p>Ukraine plans next year to reduce volumes of short-term Treasury bills and increase issues of long-term paper, Finance Minister Valentyn Koronevsky said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"This year we issued a large sum of three-month bills to cover the severe budget deficit, but short-term bills place a lot of pressure on the budget," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The finance ministry was late by up to a day in making T-bill payments in August and September, and bankers said the ministry did not have the money to meet its obligations.</p>
<p>Ukraine is relying on T-bills, issued in three-, six-, nine- and 12-month maturities, to raise 150 trillion karbovanets for the 1996 budget.</p>
<p>Three-month bills had been most popular, but the government hoped to issue more nine- and 12-month T-bills, Koronevsky said.</p>
<p>Ukraine introduced the hryvnia currency on September 2 at a rate of 100,000 karbovanets per hryvnia. But some transactions are still calculated using the old currency.</p>
