<p>Turkey said on Monday it had no comment to make on the re-election of Prime Minister Costas Simitis in arch-rival Greece but the Turkish press hailed it as a victory for peace.</p>
<p>"The elections are something that concern the Greek people themselves so we have no comment on that," foreign ministry spokesman Sermet Atacanli told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Socialist Simitis had a strong win in Sunday's polls over conservative Miltiades Evert, regarded in Turkey as a hawk.</p>
<p>"Simitis wins, warmonger Evert resigns," the Hurriyet daily said in a front-page headline. Evert said on Sunday he would resign as leader of the conservative New Democracy party after his defeat.</p>
<p>Evert had promised to take a tough line against neighbour and NATO ally Turkey. The two countries are at odds over sovereignty in the Aegean Sea, the divided island of Cyprus and minority rights.</p>
<p>Greece and Turkey almost came to blows in January in a dispute over uninhabited islets in the Aegean that was defused by Washington.</p>
