<p>Russia airlines expect to carry 40 million passengers on domestic and international routes in 2001, an increase of more than 50 percent over the 26.3 million carried in 1996, a senior aviation official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Yuri Baranov of the Russian Federal Aviation Service (FAS) said the industry had a strong chance of getting out of its deep crisis.</p>
<p>"We have opportunities to increase passenger and air cargo turnover over the next few years," Baranov said at an international airports conference which opened in Moscow on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said that the sharp increase in turnover would be mean new airlines being set up in Russia and the expansion of airport capacity.</p>
<p>Baranov said, passenger turnover this year was expected to be lower than last, falling to 26.0 million. But he expected turnover to start rising again from next year.</p>
<p>Currently, low disposable income among potential passengers and high airport taxes and ticket prices were holding down volumes, he said, particularly in northern Russia.</p>
<p>FAS said that during the first three months of this year, Russian airlines carried one million fewer passengers and 15,000 tonnes less of cargo than in the same period of 1996.</p>
<p>According to FAS, Russian airlines lost a total of $220 million in 1996 and more than 100 carriers went out of business because fewer passengers could afford to fly than in 1995.</p>
