<p>The U.N. special representative for East Timor will visit South Africa for talks with President Nelson Mandela after chairing meetings in New York between representatives of Indonesia and Portugal next week, a U.N. spokesman said Thursday.</p>
<p>The spokesman had announced Wednesday that Jamsheed Marker, a former Pakistani U.N. representative, would confer with Mandela before next week's ambassadorial-level talks on the East Timor problem.</p>
<p>Mandela has offered to help the United Nations with the long-running dispute stemming from Indonesia's occupation of East Timor in 1975, after Portugal withdrew from the territory.</p>
<p>In 1976, Indonesia incorporated East Timor as its 27th province but this has never been recognised by the United Nations, which continues to regard Portugal as the legal administering authority.</p>
<p>U.N.-mediated talks between the foreign ministers of Indonesia and Portugal have been continuing since 1983 aimed at finding an internationally acceptable solution to the problem.</p>
<p>At the most recent round of talks at the United Nations in June, the ministers agreed that senior officials of the two sides would embark on intensive negotiations, beginning on Monday.</p>
