<p>Western Resources said Wednesday it reached a multi-year settlement agreement that will provide for a total decrease in electric rates of $75 million over four years, plus $10 million in rebates.</p>
<p>The settlement deals with electric rate decreases for customers of its two units, Kansas Gas and Electric Co (KGE) and Kansas Power &amp; Light Co (KPL).</p>
<p>Western said the new settlement, reached with the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) staff, the Citizens' Utility Ratepayers Board and the City of Wichita, replaces the previous two-year rate reduction plan.</p>
<p>Western said the agreement also supports Western's projected earnings calculations in its merger plans with Kansas City Power &amp; Light Co Inc, and requires no change in previously filed financial projections regarding that transaction.</p>
<p>"The agreement reached late yesterday accommodates the interests of all parties while allowing our company to remain financially strong," John E. Hayes, Jr., Western Resources chairman and CEO, said in a statement.</p>
