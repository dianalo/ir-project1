<p>The Zairean army destroyed a rebel command post and killed 35 rebels in two days of heavy fighting around 80 km (50 miles) north of the strategic city of Kisangani, a Defence Ministry spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>The rebels were trying to break through Zairean defences on the road that leads from the town of Bafwasende, the spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>"There has been heavy fighting for two days on the road to Bafwasende. The Zairean armed forces destroyed a rebel command post and pushed the rebels back by another 10 km (six miles)," he said. "Among 35 rebels killed were a colonel and a major from the rebel forces."</p>
<p>After the fighting, the army seized 67 crates of mortar shells that had come from North Korea and an unspecified Arab country, he added.</p>
