<p>The arrest of two men in New York has triggered an investigation into what authorities said on Thursday may be an international investment scheme that purported to tap into billions of dollars in assets of the former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos.</p>
<p>William Mark Wilson, of Arvada, Colorado, and James Carter, of Troy, New York, a minister, were arrested on Tuesday on misdemeanor charges of working as unregistered securities salesmen after an undercover investigator heard them making a sales pitch about the venture at an Albany, New York, hotel, authorities said.</p>
<p>According to court papers, potential investors were told their money would be pooled to finance the efforts of a third unidentified partner, who supposedly was working to gain access to Marcos' secret Swiss bank accounts.</p>
<p>The two did not explain how the third partner would obtain the Marcos money -- the Philippine government alleges the family plundered as much as $5 billion during its years in power -- but told investors they needed to pay him a finder's fee, court papers said.</p>
<p>"That figure doesn't include Imelda Marcos' shoes," said Mark Kerry, a spokesman for New York State Attorney General Dennis Vacco, refering to the infamous collection of of shoes officials found at the presidential palace in Manila after Marcos was ousted in a popular revolt in 1986.</p>
<p>Marcos died in exile in Hawaii in 1989.</p>
<p>Sources said New York officials were looking at a scam of "major proportions" across the country and maybe overseas. Questions also were raised about whether the two men were targetting parishioners at evangelical churches through a massive national network.</p>
<p>The undercover investigator attended the sales session after a local television station called authorities with information from two viewers. The viewers said they had invested in the scheme and were having second thoughts.</p>
<p>One of them, Pearl Baker, of Caroga Lake, New York, said she thought the men were "sincere" but feared they were targetting churchgoers.</p>
<p>"I am comfortable with my investment," she said. "I have planted the seed and now it is God's hands."</p>
<p>Carter was a pastor at the Redeeming Love Gospel Church in Troy until 1995.</p>
