<title>SPAIN: Peseta debt/interbank closing report.</title>
<headline>Peseta debt/interbank closing report.</headline>

<p>Spanish government bonds and the peseta moved higher on Monday, fuelled by expectations of monetary easing, traders said.</p>
<p>They said these hopes have been compounded by more optimism on upcoming inflation data.</p>
<p>The CPI is expected to rise to 3.9 percent year-on-year in August from 3.7 percent in July, implying that a recent hike in taxes on tobacco and alcohol has not had such a large effect on prices as originally anticipated, they said.</p>
<p>Some think a rate cut could emerge as soon as Friday, when the Bank of Spain's regular repo auction takes place, they said.</p>
