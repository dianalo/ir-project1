<p>Dubai gold traders on Sunday welcomed comments from a leading Indian bank official that reaffirmed New Delhi's commitment to further liberalise regulations governing the import and export of gold.</p>
<p>India should allow the free import and export of gold and give up the present system of trade through designated agencies, Y.V. Reddy, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) told a gold seminar in the Indian capital on Saturday.</p>
<p>"Free import under open general licence and free exports are pre-conditions for capturing world markets," said Reddy.</p>
<p>Further liberalisation of the Indian gold market would help fan bullion demand in India -- demand that could be met by Dubai -- as the price premium of gold in India to international prices would fall, Dubai-based traders said.</p>
<p>"In the short and medium term liberalisation is going to be positive for Dubai," said Rolf Schneebeli, the World Gold Council's chief executive for the Middle East and Indian-subcontinent based in Dubai.</p>
<p>Indian banks would be allowed to import gold if full liberalisation was carried out but foreign banks would still be reluctant to ship bullion consignments directly to India because of New Delhi's credit rating, Schneebeli added.</p>
<p>"Dubai has a good banking system and that will work for Dubai," Schneebeli said.</p>
<p>Dubai is the main source of gold imported into India, predominantly carried by Non Resident Indians (NRIs) who are permitted to take up to 10 kg of gold every six months into India subject to duty.</p>
<p>Smuggling is also a regular feature on the supply route while official sales to state Indian agencies are minimal.</p>
<p>India has gradually liberalised its gold sector since 1990 but at present state-run State Bank of India and Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation are the only official entities allowed to import gold though NRIs and imports from firms with special licences also contribute to imports.</p>
<p>"The proposals can only be good for Dubai as long as we keep our competitive edge here," said one Gulf-based trader.</p>
<p>Retail gold prices in Dubai's gold souks and jewellery shops are some of the most competitive in the world.</p>
<p>S.S. Tarapore, a former chairman of a RBI committee on capital account rupee convertibility, told the same conference in New Delhi that India needed to free gold imports immediately for effective macroeconomic and exchange rate management.</p>
<p>India is the world's single largest gold market with consumption running at around an annual 500 tonnes.</p>
<p>Approximately 85 percent of gold imported in Dubai -- which hit 350 tonnes in 1996 -- is re-exported to India.</p>
<p>Demand in Dubai remained capped by the Indian monsoon and holiday season though traders expect a combination of low bullion prices, a robust harvest and upcoming Hindu festivals to fan demand higher by late August.</p>
<p>Despite the seasonal summer-lull, demand was much stronger on a year-on-year basis as Indian buyers got more gold for their rupees as bullion's price fell, traders said.</p>
<p>Dubai's benchmark TT bar -- 3.746 ounces of 24 carat gold -- was quoted on Sunday at 4,491 UAE dirhams ($1,223.70), down from 4,505 on July 27.</p>
<p>International spot gold was last quoted on Saturday at $324.50-$325.00 an ounce versus a week-on-week quote of $325.45-$325.95 and $328.60-$329.10 on July 20.</p>
