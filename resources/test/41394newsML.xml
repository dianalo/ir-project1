<p>Federal authorities Monday were investigating the cause of a fire that destroyed a predominantly black church in the California state capital, officials said.</p>
<p>The blaze at the New Home Missionary Baptist Church in Sacramento broke out a few minutes before midnight Sunday and took 30 firefighters an hour to put out, fire officials said. The church was declared a "total loss" and damage was estimated at $400,000, officials said.</p>
<p>A firefighter and a civilian were injured, the Sacramento Fire Department said, but gave no details.</p>
<p>Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF) were helping the Sacramento Fire Department investigate the cause of the blaze, ATF spokesman Ed Gleba said. He said it was too early to say if the fire was arson or accidental.</p>
<p>The fire broke out in a construction area where an extension to the church was being built, Gleba said. He said investigators brought sniffer dogs but were waiting for rubble to be removed before they could get to the site of the fire.</p>
<p>Authorities have investigated more than 70 fires at U.S. churches since the start of 1995, many of them at black churches in the South. Investigators believe some of the fires were racially motivated.</p>
<p>Gleba said California has not been a target for church burnings over the past year.</p>
