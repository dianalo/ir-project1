<p>Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori predicted inflation in September would be 0.3 percent, bringing the cumulative nine-month price rise to 9.2 percent.</p>
<p>This would compare with 0.4 percent inflation in September 1995, and a 7.8 percent cumulative rate in the first nine months of last year, according to Central Bank figures.  </p>
<p>Fujimori, in a speech late Thursday, added that annualized inflation up to September was 11.7 percent. This compares with 10.0 percent annualized inflation up to September 1995, according to the Central Bank.</p>
<p>The government is predicting annual inflation for 1996 of around 12 percent, up from 10.23 percent last year.</p>
<p>Fujimori also announced that employers' obligatory contributions to state housing fund Fonavi would be reduced to seven percent of their workers' salaries from the current level of nine percent.</p>
