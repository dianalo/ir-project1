<p>Budget measures the Italian government is set to approve on Friday will reduce public administration net debt to 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)in 1997, near the 3.0 percent ratio set for entry to the single European currency, research body Prometeia said.</p>
<p>Prometeia said it was using the Maastricht accounting parameter for European economic and monetary union rather than the one used by the government.</p>
<p>The government's deficit targets in its 1997/1999 rolling financial target plan (DPEF) are based on public sector accounts and not on public administration accounts.</p>
<p>The public administration deficit is the parameter used in the rest of Europe and by the Maastricht Treaty in its definition of criteria for EMU entry.</p>
<p>According to the DPEF document the PSBR/GDP was seen at 4.5 percent in 1997, falling below 3.0 percent in 1998.</p>
<p>But the government has now said its planned budget of some 50 trillion lire will cut the deficit/GDP ratio to 3.0 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Prometeia forecast that a package to reduce Italy's primary borrowing requirement by 55 trillion lire in 1997 would be accompanied by a sharp fall in market interest rates, to an annual average of 5.8 percent from just over 8.0 percent now on short-term Treasury bills (BOT).</p>
<p>Italy could therefore reach a goal which "is an ambitious objective even for the other European nations," Prometeia said in a statement accompanying its study.</p>
<p>But "the public finance scenario taking shape will involve costs of around 0.3-0.4 percent of GDP in 1997...limiting growth to between 1.0 and 1.5 percent next year," the Bologna-based institute said.</p>
<p>But Italy's efforts will be compensated, "pushing growth above 2.5 percent in the following years up to 1999 along with a strong reduction in interest rates and an accompanying recovery in corporate and households' confidence."</p>
<p>Favouring a rate fall will be good news on the consumer price front, with inflation seen at an average 3.9 percent this year, falling to an average 3.2 percent in 1997 and below three percent in 1988, Prometeia added.</p>
<p>The Bank of Italy has said its monetary policy still aims to cut CPI below an average three percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Prometeia forecast that the strong stagnation of consumption seen in 1996 should end, even if the recovery would not be brilliant. Some help could come from exports, which were penalised this year by the slowdown in Europe and the lira's strength, but which could grow by 7.5-8.0 percent in 1997. --Milan newsroom +392 6610.1399</p>
