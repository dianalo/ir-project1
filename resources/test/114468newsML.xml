<p>A police officer was shot dead late Sunday night in a crime-ridden New York neighbourhood, the fourth policeman to die in the line of duty in the city this year, police said Monday.</p>
<p>Housing Bureau Officer Brian Jones, 27, was shot in the head amid gunfire in a crowd in the East New York section of Brooklyn, apparently after trying to help a fellow officer settle a dispute. He was declared dead an hour later in the hospital.</p>
<p>Police arrested a suspect and recovered the weapon that authorities believed was used in the shooting, a New York City police spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Police identified the arrested man as Antoine Windley, a parolee with a record of drug arrests.</p>
