<p>The search is on in earnest for the "golden clone" at the Tea Research Institute (TRI), set amidst lush green tea bushes on this estate in Sri Lanka's central hills.</p>
<p>"Developing the perfect clone has top priority," said the institute's director, Wester Modder. "Conventional plant breeding is too slow and the 'golden clone' will emerge from new biotechnology."</p>
<p>The TRI is seeking funds from foreign donors to set up a modern biotechnology laboratory to speed up its search for new, high-yielding tea plant clones resistant to pests, drought and disease, Modder told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Indian Ocean island, the world's leading tea exporter, will need to ship at least 260 million kg of tea by 2005 to maintain its 18-20 percent share of the global market, Modder said.</p>
<p>Exports of Ceylon tea remain the island's main net foreign exchange earner and are expected to hit a record 250 million kg in 1996, from 245 million kg in the previous year.</p>
<p>Prices for Sri Lanka's main export crop soared to record highs last year mainly because of heavy demand from Russia and other former Soviet republics as well as the Middle East.</p>
<p>HIGHER PRODUCTIVITY VITAL TO STAY COMPETITIVE</p>
<p>But the island must raise field productivity considerably to remain competitive after being plagued for years by low yields and poor labour productivity, Modder said.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka's national annual average yield is around 1,300 kg per hectare, much lower than those of its competitors, especially Kenya, but some, better-managed estates can produce up to 3,000 kg per hectare.</p>
<p>"Kenyan yields are phenomenal," Modder said. "But you can't really compare because they have very good soils, having started growing tea only recently, while our soils are degraded since we've been planting for 100-150 years. (Sri Lanka) can never hope to reach Kenyan yields."</p>
<p>The TRI aims to develop clones with yields of 4,000 kg per hectare per year for the distinct low grown teas and 3,000 kg per hectare a year for high growns, he said.</p>
<p>But even with the new clones Sri Lanka would not be able to achieve Kenyan yield levels. TRI's clones would not be suited to soil and climatic conditions all over Sri Lanka and the yields expected would not be national averages, he said.</p>
<p>The area of land under tea has fallen by nine percent over the last 10 years as lands were given up for village expansion and the cultivation of other crops.</p>
<p>TEA BUSHES IN VIALS</p>
<p>"We're trying tissue culture to cut short clone developing time," the institute's plant breeder, V. Shanmugarajah, told Reuters. "Our aim is to produce 30,000 plants in two years."</p>
<p>Scientists now take up to 20 years to develop a new clone with desirable characteristics using conventional plant breeding methods, he said.</p>
<p>Modder said the use of micro-propagation through tissue culture -- producing little tea bushes in vials -- allows scientists to develop a large number of clones much faster -- in five to seven years.</p>
<p>The little plants are put in the TRI nursery when they grow roots and are later planted in the field.</p>
<p>"We're trying to combine a whole series of traits into a single clone," he said.</p>
<p>But one clone can't be universally productive and different clones are required for the island's varied climatic zones and soils, he said.</p>
<p>The use of clones started in the early 1950s with the TRI's 2000 series of clones. It is now producing the 3000 and 4000 series but their use is not yet widespread, Modder said.</p>
