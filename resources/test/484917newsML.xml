<p>Ireland's first quarter Exchequer Borrowing Requirement (EBR) was 151 million Irish pounds, the finance ministry said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Economists' had expected an EBR somewhere between 150 and 300 million Irish pounds compared with 561 million at the end of March last year.</p>
<p>The government's full-year EBR target is 637 million Irish pounds.  </p>
<p>The ministry said the first quarter deficit was due to a number of favourable timings and other factors which had increased the deficit in 1996, "so a straight year-on-year comparison is misleading."</p>
<p>Total current receipts in the quarter amounted to 3.1 billion pounds. The tax inflow of 3.05 billion, or 23 percent of the full year target, was slightly ahead of expectations, it said.</p>
<p>The year-on-year increase in tax receipts was 16 percent.</p>
<p>This overstates the underlying position because of the favourable impact on the first quarter of 1997 of an estimated 119 million Irish pounds carryover from the ending of advance payment of VAT by certain traders last December, it said.</p>
<p>But even allowing for this factor, the underlying buoyancy remains strong at 11.5 per cent, compared to the full year target of six percent, although the cost of substantial tax concessions will reduce receipts later in the year, it said.  </p>
<p>Income tax inflows were described as satisfactory and maintained the pattern of strong performance of the second half of 1996.</p>
<p>Indirect taxes were also performing well, it said.</p>
<p>Corporation tax receipts were below expectations, probably because of timing factors relating to the payment for this tax. The money should be recovered in April, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Non-tax revenue amounted to 54 million pounds or 17 percent of the full-year target, in line with the normal first quarter pattern, the ministry said.</p>
<p>Total current expenditure in the period amounted to 3.17 billion pounds or 23.7 percent of the annual estimate, it said.</p>
<p>Total Current Supply expenditure amounted to 2.44 billion compared with 2.36 million last year, an increase of 3.4 percent compared to the target for the year of 6.6 percent.</p>
<p>Overall the difference btween current revenue and current expenditure over the first quarter gave a current budget deficit of 69 million pounds, the ministry said.</p>
<p>The end-March capital budget reflects strong EU inflows which have been ahead of receipts in the same period last year. The overall capital deficit of 82 million pounds is 39 million lower than at the corresponding stage in 1996, it said.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Ruairi Quinn said in a statement that last year's tax and expenditure figures had been influenced by negative timing factors which significantly increased the EBR last year.</p>
<p>But this year the timing factors had been reversed, he noted. "At the underlying level, there is no evidence of any significant changes in expenditure over these early months compared with Budget expectations," Quinn said. -- Dublin Newsroom +353-1-6613377</p>
