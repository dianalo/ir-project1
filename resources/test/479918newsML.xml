<p>Israel's Teva Pharamceutical Industries said on Tuesday it had won interim approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its generic version of Glaxo Wellcome PLC's Zovirax.</p>
<p>Zovirax is an anti-viral drug and has annual U.S. sales of $140 million, Teva said. Zovirax's U.S. patent expires April 22 and that other generic makers had already received interim FDA approvals to produce it, it added.</p>
<p>Teva said its generic version would be sold by its U.S. generic drug unit under the name Acyclovir Capsules.</p>
