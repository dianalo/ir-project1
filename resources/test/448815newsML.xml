<title>DENMARK: Goldman Sachs cuts Danish Phoenix stake.</title>
<headline>Goldman Sachs cuts Danish Phoenix stake.</headline>
<dateline>COPENHAGEN 1997-03-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Goldman Sachs International said on Monday that it had cut to below five percent its stake in Danish roadbuilder Phoenix Contractors, subject of a takeover battle between two rival suitors.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs announced on January 31 that it held 5.5 percent in Phoenix, complying with Copenhagen Stock Exchange rules demanding disclosure if a stake rises above five percent.</p>
<p>Monday's statement said only that Goldman Sachs no longer had a disclosable interest and did not say how many shares it had sold or to whom.</p>
<p>Norway's Rieber and Son and Danish Icopal have each offered 876 million crowns for Phoenix, which has advised shareholders to sell to the Norwegians.</p>
