<p>Dealing profits at NatWest Markets, the investment banking arm of National Westminster Bank Plc, grew 12 percent to 543 million stg in 1996 from 485 million in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange income, at 176 million stg, remained steady in 1996 in what the bank said were "difficult" market conditions.</p>
<p>Securities income was up 13 percent to 96 million stg, the bank said in a statement accompanying full-year results.</p>
<p>The bank also said equity dealing profits rose substantially in buoyant markets.</p>
<p>Other dealing profits rose by 34 million stg to 171 million, reflecting strong increases in rate-risk management products, said the bank.</p>
<p>Overall 1996 pre-tax profits at NatWest Bank rose to 1.122 billion stg.</p>
