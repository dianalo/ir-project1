<title>CROATIA: Croatian interbank rates hold in livelier trade.</title>
<headline>Croatian interbank rates hold in livelier trade.</headline>
<dateline>ZAGREB 1997-02-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>Croatian money market rates held in Wednesday's morning trade as banks asked for fresh kuna funds, dealers said.</p>
<p>They put morning trade at 37.9 million kuna of which 27 million were bought by one large bank.</p>
<p>All were call money loans, granted at a steady 10.5 percent rate, save for a smaller placement struck at 11 percent.</p>
<p>Demand at 40 million kuna slightly overshot supply at 38.5 million, but it could not be entirely met as borrowers and lenders failed to agree on terms.</p>
<p>In Tuesday's overnight trade one savings bank bought five million kuna to maintain its mandatory reserve.</p>
