<p>Cabletron Systems Inc blamed softening demand among customers for some of its older lines of network equipment gear for an expected earnings shortfall during the recently ended May fiscal quarter.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, Cabletron said it expected earnings for the first quarter ended in May to "meet or slightly exceed" earnings per share of $0.37, well below the latest First Call analysts consensus estimate of $0.50 a share for the quarter.</p>
<p>In a statement, Cabletron cited soft demand for shared media, a product category expected to account for less than 10 percent of revenues in 1997, according to analyst projections.</p>
<p>It also mentioned other, unspecified "mature" product lines as partly to blame for the disappointing earnings.</p>
<p>Although the company said demand remained strong for its new high-end switching product lines, it said delays in production of its new SmartSwitch products created a backlog that "may have resulted in some lost sales opportunities."</p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Operating Officer Craig Benson said sales results for some operations, particularly Europe, fell "substantially short" of targets at the end of the quarter.</p>
<p>In addition, he said overall profit margins are expected to be hurt by the sales shortfall, as well as the product mix and other factors. Product mix refers to the relative contribution of various product lines to overall revenues.</p>
<p>Cabletron said that as it and other networking companies have previously said, it has been seeing longer purchasing cycles for its core products due to the larger dollar amounts of customer orders and longer customer planning cycles.</p>
