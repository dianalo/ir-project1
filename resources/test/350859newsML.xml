<title>RUSSIA: Yes, I killed the bears.</title>

<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has provoked some rare outrage in the Russian media for shooting dead two bear cubs and their mother, aroused from winter hibernation.</p>
<p>Ogonyok magazine denounced the killing during the hunt last month as "akin to common murder".</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin was unabashed. "Hunting of bears is not banned, it's a normal thing," he said with a coy grin in an interview shown on national television on Sunday night.</p>
<p>"There was a female bear and two other smaller ones, but they were grown," he said.</p>
<p>The portly premier was responding to reports that he travelled by helicopter to a village north of Moscow last month after regional officials spotted a family of hibernating bears in their den.</p>
<p>Bear hunting is traditionally viewed as a way of proving a man's status as a "muzhik" -- a hearty, real Russian man -- and has rarely roused any public outcry.</p>
<p>But Chernomyrdin, a potential successor to ailing President Boris Yeltsin, found himself attacked by two magazines and independent NTV television's popular "Itogi" programme.</p>
<p>Ogonyok's latest issue gave a detailed account of the prime minister's hunting exploits and twisted the knife by illustrating it with pictures of cuddly baby cubs.</p>
<p>"One is overcome by a feeling of bitter vexation at the concept of the leaders of a country with great humanitarian ideals finding time for a hunt that is more akin to a common murder," it fulminated.</p>
<p>"I'd like to watch those who are writing about this meet those bears eye-to-eye to watch their reaction," Chernomyrdin retorted.</p>
<p>"I love hunting, I really love hunting, so it is with pleasure that I went when I had a free moment."</p>
<p>Past Soviet leaders including Leonid Brezhnev and Nikita Khrushchev were well known for their love of hunting. But they did not have to answer questions about their victims.</p>
