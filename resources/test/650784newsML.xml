<p>Farmer owned group Milk Marque (MM), which supplies about 60 percent of milk to dairies in England and Wales, is expected to reduce its milk prices further in October to reflect the strength of sterling within the EC, said Neil Davidson head of Northern Foods Plc's dairy division.</p>
<p>He said a reduction of 1.2 pence to 1.6 pence a litre can be expected. In an interview, Davidson estimated that a one pence reduction in the price equates to a positive 7-8 million stg on trading profits for the group's dairy division over a six month period.</p>
<p>Dairy and food company Northern Foods buys half its milk direct from farmers and the other half from Milk Marque, created in 1994 after the British government disbanded the state controlled Milk Marketing Board.</p>
<p>From April 1, Milk Marque reduced its raw milk prices to 22.1 pence a litre from about 25p. Milk Marque offers six month contracts to buyers set two months in advance.</p>
<p>Davidson echoed the dairy industry's frustration with Milk Marque, saying the lower limit price set by MM is too high and its pricing system too inflexible. "It needs to be more immediately responsive to currency fluctuations and that would also help Milk Marque clear its milk when there are periods of currency uncertainty," he said.</p>
<p>Earlier,Northern reported a 26 percent drop in profits from its dairy division to 44.8 million for 1996/97 due to the 17 million stg impact of lower commodity prices for its by products such as butter fat.</p>
<p>But the company's executives said they think the pound's run up against the mark has now run its course and expect its dairy commodity prices to at least stabilise as a result.</p>
<p>The rate of decline of Northern's milk sales at the doorstep has also slowed, running at around eight percent by March 1997. Northern also implemented a one pence on a pint price increase for doorstep delivery in the north of England in October 1996 and in the south in February 1997, without seeing any significant worsening of the declining sales trend.</p>
<p>As a result of these factors, Northern's dairy division should show a much improved profits performance over the coming year, said Davidson.</p>
<p>The company's shares were up 5p at 204p as analysts took heart from Northern's positive comments on its dairy business.</p>
