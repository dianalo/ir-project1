<p>NWE naphtha prices ended sharply higher on Friday as the arbitrage to the U.S. continued to light a fire under the bulls heading into next week.</p>
<p>"(The arb) should still work," said one broker.</p>
<p>"The general consensus is bullish for naphtha," he said. "Cargoes have been sold to the U.S. and there is talk of more going and there is nothing come from the East."</p>
<p>A scorching rally in U.S. propane prices has increased petchem demand for naphtha, sources said.</p>
<p>In NWE, demand for full-range barges was seen boosting those prices after Algeria's Skikda port was still closed from Tuesday, brokers said.</p>
<p>Two end-users were expected to load cargoes this week and that may be delayed until next week, they said.</p>
<p>Dec swaps jumped $4 to $225.50/$226.50 and Jan rose $3.50 to $218/$219. Feb was a further $5 backwardated at $213/$214.</p>
<p>Cargoes were notionally assessed at a $3 premium to Dec swaps, at $228/$230 cif.</p>
