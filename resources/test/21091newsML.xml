<p>A common anti-malarial drug, mefloquine, can cause nightmares, dizziness and other potentially serious side-effects and should be used carefully, British doctors reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Such side-effects are more common than believed and can affect up to 40 percent of people who take anti-malarial drugs, Dr Paul Clarke of Medical Advisory Services for Travellers Abroad Ltd and colleagues at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine reported.</p>
<p>"This study shows that about 40 percent of travellers taking either mefloquine or chloroquine and proguanil can expect to experience some sort of adverse side effect, although most effects will be relatively trivial," they wrote in the British Medical Journal.</p>
<p>But one in 140 people who take mefloquine (Hoffman-La Roche's Lariam) are temporarily disabled by neurological or psychiatric side-effects, they said.</p>
<p>"These include anxiety, depression, sleep disturbances, nightmares, hallucinations, and, in a few people, overt psychotic attacks or convulsions," they wrote.</p>
<p>The report will come as bad news to Swiss pharmaceutical giant Hoffman-La Roche, which is fighting a class action suit by a group of 500 British travellers who alleged they were not warned about side-effects that included hallucinations, seizures and severe mood swings.</p>
<p>Lariam, brought to the market in the 1980s, is now the most commonly prescribed drug against chloroquine-resistant malaria.</p>
<p>Clarke's group surveyed 1,200 adults who took mefloquine and 1,200 who took chloroquine plus proguanil, two other common drugs.</p>
<p>They recorded 333 "neuropsychiatric events" in mefloquine users and 189 in others, although fewer than one percent of these "events" were disabling.</p>
<p>"Mefloquine is appropriate only when the risk is high both of malaria and of chloroquine resistance," they concluded.</p>
