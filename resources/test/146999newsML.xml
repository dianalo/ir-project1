<p>RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp reiterated that it sees no spinoff of its food unit prior to 1997.</p>
<p>In response to a question, a spokeswoman said, "The board has stated it would not consider a spinoff prior to 1997."</p>
<p>The spokeswoman also said, "We believe we need to see some resolutions in some of the litigation currently pending against us before we can successfully move ahead with a spinoff."  </p>
<p>The spokeswoman said it has also been the board's position for more than a year that there would be no spinoff prior to the end of 1998 "if the resulting entities were not investment grade."</p>
<p>In response to a question, the spokeswoman said there has been brief and informal contact over the telephone recently between investor Carl Icahn and chairman and chief executive Steven Goldstone. Icahn has been pushing for a quicker spinoff.</p>
<p>RJR Nabisco owns about 80 percent of the food unit, which trades publicly as Nabisco Holdings Corp.</p>
