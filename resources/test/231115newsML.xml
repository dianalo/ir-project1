<headline>Lehman says positive on Hong Kong's credit outlook.</headline>

<p>Progress in Hong Kong's political transition and a buoyant economy bode well for the territory's credit outlook, Stephen Taran, credit research manager at Lehman Brothers, said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The credit outlook for Hong Kong is extremely positive," Taran told reporters.</p>
<p>Most of the uncertainty surrounding Hong Kong's future has stemmed from worries over its political situation. But such concerns have moderated, he said.</p>
<p>"We have had progress in the last six months in the definition of Hong Kong's leadership," said Taran. He said the selection later this month of a post-1997 chief executive for Hong Kong will further clarify its political future.</p>
<p>Taran said he has been cheered by China's comments that it hoped senior Hong Kong civil servants would remain at their posts after the British colony reverts to China next year.</p>
<p>He noted that Tung Chee-Hwa, the frontrunning candidate for post-handover chief executive, has said that he would like chief secretary Anson Chan, one of Hong Kong's most popular leaders, to keep her job.</p>
<p>Taran also said he believed the provisional council will put together an electoral system similar to Hong Kong's current one.</p>
<p>Other good news comes from the economic front, he said. Lehman Brothers projects that Hong Kong's economic growth will accelerate to 5.1 percent in 1997 from 3.9 percent this year.</p>
<p>Taran said Hong Kong's economic fundamentals compare favorably with those of higher-rated European countries.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is rated Single-A by Standard and Poor's Corp and A3 by Moody's Investors Service.</p>
<p>The stabilization of China's economy, its return to an expansionary path and a possible sovereign rating upgrade for the mainland adds to the positive picture for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"There is no justification for Standard and Poor's BBB for China," said Taran. Moody's Investors Service rates China and Hong Kong the same at A3.</p>
<p>Lehman produces its own series of sovereign ratings. It assesses Hong Kong as a "high A" and China as "mid-A."</p>
<p>Taran said that S&amp;P's reasons for China's BBB rating--fears of hyperinflation, worries that contract disputes would hinder foreign investment and political uncertainty over the transfer of Hong Kong to China--no longer apply.</p>
<p>Spreads on Hong Kong's dollar-denominated debt issues are tightening as global bond investors become more comfortable with the territory, Taran noted.</p>
<p>He said he expects spreads to tighten another 10 basis points next year, a significant tightening for investment grade paper, even if S&amp;P does not upgrade China.</p>
<p>Hong Kong credits trade wider than some similarly-rated Asian credits because "there are still people that are not convinced about Hong Kong's future and want to see how the transition goes," said Taran.</p>
<p>While Taran said he was optimistic about Hong Kong's ability to work out sensitive issues of political freedoms after the handover, he acknowledged that troubles on that front could deter foreign investors and hurt Hong Kong's longer-term credit outlook.</p>
