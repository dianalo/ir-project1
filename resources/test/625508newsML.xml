<p>Interaction Media Corp said Friday that it will dismiss most of its staff, effective May 30, and cease operations June 6, unless it obtains additional funding.</p>
<p>Interaction said in a Form 8-K filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it has been unsuccessful in its attempts to obtain additional financing and has exhausted its cash resources.</p>
<p>While it continues to pursue strategic and financial relationships, the company said it has minimal expectations of success in these efforts.</p>
<p>Interaction also said that it will be delisted June 10 unless it can show NASDAQ that it meets all SmallCap Market requirements for continued listing. The company added it does not believe that it will be able to do so.</p>
<p>The company has been in the business of developing and operating interactive multimedia kiosks on college campuses.</p>
