<title>INDONESIA: Indonesian rupiah strong on band speculation.</title>
<headline>Indonesian rupiah strong on band speculation.</headline>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah was well bid against the dollar in volatile late Friday trading on sustained speculation of a band widening, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said spot dollar managed to rebound to 2,362.90/63.00 at 0900 GMT after falling three points below the central bank intervention band at midday. It opened at 2,363.0/64.0.</p>
<p>A local bank dealer said the dollar recovered after players were confident that band rumours were unfounded for now.</p>
<p>The central bank kept its intervention band unchanged at 2,363/2,555 and the conversion band at 2,363/2,411 on Friday.  </p>
<p>"The market is calmer now although the rate is still trading slightly off the band," the dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the central bank was believed to have absorbed plenty of dollars on Friday during the squaring time, driving operators to sell swaps across the board immediately.</p>
<p>One foreign bank dealer said operators believed liquidity would be pretty ample on Tuesday which would depress swaps.</p>
<p>He said some even assumed money from dollars buying would also come in on Monday because of some buying on Thursday.</p>
<p>"So people seemed to anticipate an ample week," he said.  </p>
<p>Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,362.00/62.75 and 2,361.35/61.50, respectively. Overnight swap was at 1.5/1.6 and tom/next was last given at 2.3/3.3 points.</p>
<p>Dealers in Jakarta said they did not believe the central bank would bow to market pressure to widen the band.</p>
<p>One well-placed economist said the central bank governor had explicitly said this week the rupiah exchange rate will be maintained at a realistic level without anti-export bias.</p>
<p>He said this meant the central bank would maintain its band at present because a widening would appreciate the rupiah.  </p>
<p>One-month swap declined to 11.0/12.0 from 12.75/13.50, two to 22.5/23.25 from 23.75/24.50, three to 34.0/35.0 from 37.25/37.50 and six to 74.0/75.0 from 75.5/76.5 points.</p>
