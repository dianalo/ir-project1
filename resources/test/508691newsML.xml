<p>Nobel Peace Prize winner Eli Wiesel, a survivor of two concentration camps, is expected to be named chairman of the $200 million humanitarian fund set up by Swiss banks and industries to aid ageing Holocaust survivors, sources close to the fund said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The sources told Reuters they expected the Romanian-born Wiesel, a survivor of Auschwitz and Buchenwald, to be named chairman during a meeting of the Swiss Federal Council in Berne on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wiesel, who received the 1986 Nobel peace prize for his work in exposing the horrors of the Holocaust, was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Sources close to him said he was initially reluctant to accept the post but agreed out of a sense of obligation.</p>
<p>The Federal Council is also expected to name six other members to the executive Wiesel is to chair, plus an 18-member council for the fund.</p>
<p>The fund was established earlier this year with donations from the big three Swiss banks after months of controversy over Switzerland's financial dealings with Nazi Germany during the Second World War.</p>
<p>Three members of the seven-member executive for the fund are to be chosen by the World Jewish Restitution Organisation, a branch of the World Jewish Congress, and four members by the Swiss government.</p>
<p>One of the Swiss members is expected to be Rolf Bloch, the head of the Swiss Jewish community, the sources, who asked not to be identified, said.</p>
<p>Also expected to be named to the executive are Dr. Joseph Burg, the president of the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Israel and Avraham Herschson, chairman of the Israeli parliament's restitution committee.</p>
