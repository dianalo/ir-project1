<p>The plants stretch on in monotonous blocks of concrete and glass, broken only by large proclamations of well-known corporate names.</p>
<p>Intel, Motorola, Hewlett-Packard, Siemens, Toshiba, Sony ; this veritable "whos who" of the electronics world nestles on the southeast part of this northern island state against a backdrop of lushly-forested hills and a slim stretch of ocean.</p>
<p>The wheels that drive a large part of Malaysia's economy grind quietly, are shuttered behind fences and walls in the Bayan Lepas industrial park.</p>
<p>But the measure of the electronics and electrical industries' importance to Malaysia cannot be understated -- the components comprise about half of the country's total exports.</p>
<p>For some firms, Malaysia is no less key to their production. Intel Corp assembles and tests more than 50 percent of its Pentium chips at its Penang facility, which dominates the park with six plants.</p>
<p>MALAYSIA'S SILICON VALLEY FEELS RUMBLINGS OF CHANGE</p>
<p>Twenty-six years after welcoming its first electronics factory, Malaysia's Silicon Valley is feeling the rumblings of change, as it faces competition within and without the country.</p>
<p>From 30 plants in 1970, state agency Penang Development Corp (PDC) now boasts more than 720 factories in five industrial parks covering 5,850 acres (2,370 hectares).</p>
<p>But that prosperous track record is threatened by cut-throat competition and scarcity of land and skilled labour.</p>
<p>Components made in Penang can increasingly be duplicated at cheaper costs in emerging economies like Vietnam and China -- or elsewhere in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Factories have mushroomed across the causeway with Singapore in southern Johor state, and in northern Kedah's Kulim High Technology Park.</p>
<p>Rain forest-blanketed Sarawak, on Borneo island, is also attracting electronics plants. In July, officials said that state capital Kuching would play host to Malaysia's first wafer-fabrication plant.</p>
<p>The PDC, a self-financed promotion and development agency, has said publically that it wants to bring in more value-added technologies, phasing out the labour-intensive assembly related work that can easily be done somewhere else.</p>
<p>It is also diversifying its manufacturing base, moving away from semiconductor operations that make up 40 percent of the industry and into high-tech sectors like personal computers.</p>
<p>"The focus on Malaysia is towards automation and higher tech, which would be the right move," said Joseph Phillips, chairman of the Malaysian-American Electronics Industry Association.</p>
<p>The group represents 17 U.S. electronics firms, including companies in the semiconductor and disk drive industries.</p>
<p>A visit to three electronics companies provided a mix of the good, the bad and the uncertain.</p>
<p>Fresh from a recent brush with 3,600 retrenchments in Penang, industry executives were keen to reassure visitors that this was no repeat of the bone-jarring 1985-1986 recession which laid off 14,000 to 15,000 in Malaysia.</p>
<p>Dell Computer Corp is the newest kid on the block and Penang officials hope the wave of the future.</p>
<p>The first integrated manufacturer -- making not just parts but a whole product alongside a service centre -- the Austin, Texas-based Dell began shipping PCs out last November from its 238,000 square foot Asia-Pacific Customer Centre.</p>
<p>Currently making desktop PCs and laptops, Dell will soon be producing network servers as well.</p>
<p>Its customer service centre, servicing the Asia-Pacific region, is held up as a shining example of the kind of value-added industries Malaysia is trying to attract.</p>
<p>A multi-lingual staff handles phone orders, heart of Dell's business as a direct-sales PC maker, and answer user queries.</p>
<p>A relatively small staff -- the carpeted, cubicled Penang facility looks more like an oversized office than a plant -- has been a plus for Dell amid Penang's chronic labour shortage.</p>
<p>"Frankly, when some companies are going to downsize or decide to consolidate, we smile, because there's more opportunity for us," said Phil Kelly, managing director of Dell's Asia Pacific Group.</p>
<p>"We don't employ 3,000 people, so we don't have the same issues (as large companies)," he said. Dell currently has about 400 workers, which will grow by 50 to 100 next year.</p>
<p>In the fiercely competitive disk drive industry, Komag USA (M) Sdn, a unit of Milpitas, California-based Komag Corp, can afford to sit pretty and even plan great expansions.</p>
<p>As the world's biggest maker of thin-film media, the primary storage material for disk drive digital data, Komag's Penang plant is running at full capacity.</p>
<p>Step into its lobby in Campus 1, on 13 acres (five hectares) in Penang, and you'd better have disposable shoe covers on.</p>
<p>Its processes require "clean room" conditions, and Komag takes that standard very seriously. Staff -- the managing director included -- wear company-issued Reeboks instead of outside shoes which could carry contaminants.</p>
<p>Campus 2 is on 90 acres (36 hectares) in land-rich Sarawak state, where Komag has invested some $75 million. The abundance of water, crucial to the disk drive process, helped dictate the plant's location, Komag plant managing director Tan Thiam Seng said.</p>
<p>"Multi-site expansion is one of the crucial things (for us). In our plating and polishing operations, we use a tremendous amount of water," he said.</p>
<p>Noting that Komag's 24-hour shifts faced considerable disruption during the 12-15 hour blackout in peninsular Malaysia in August, Tan said the Sarawak plant will benefit when the Bakun hydro-electric dam is up and running.</p>
<p>Some 1,400 work at Komag's Penang plant and several hundred more at the plant in Sarawak's state capital of Kuching.</p>
<p>While Dell and Komag are expanding despite the electronic industry's mini shakeout this year, Germany's Siemens AG's Siemens Semiconductor Sdn Bhd is feeling the chill from a drop in chip prices from huge oversupplies.</p>
<p>SIEMENS SCALES BACK PRODUCTION, CUTS OVERTIME</p>
<p>With over 5,000 employees at its Penang plant and another in central Melaka state which makes memory chips -- the hardest hit of semiconductors this year -- Siemens has scaled back production and cut or eliminated overtime.</p>
<p>But this is no recession. Siemens' Penang plant managing director Yap Peng Hooi said no chip makers on the island, his company included, have been forced to lay off workers.</p>
<p>The drop in demand, which saw memory chip prices slashed as much as 80 percent, was a wake-up call for the industry.</p>
<p>Yap is concerned enough about Penang's competitiveness to be part of a seven-member executive think-tank that seeks to solve problems and mull future strategies.</p>
<p>"I think the slowdown (in the industry) itself is not the biggest deal," he said. A more crucial question for the industry is that "to add value, you have to have capable people."</p>
<p>Adds Siemens' commercial manager K.S. Tan, "We're very quickly losing the wage and salary (advantages). We're doing a business now that is common to everybody."</p>
