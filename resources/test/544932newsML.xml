<p>Dutch business</p>
<p>confidence index fell to 3.2 in March from February, the Central</p>
<p>Bureau of Statistics (CBS) said.</p>
<p>DUTCH BUSINESS CONFIDENCE INDEX (No base date)</p>
<p>	   Mar 97	Feb 97	Mar 96</p>
<p>	     3.2	   3.9	   0.3</p>
<p>The business confidence index is derived from the monthly</p>
<p>CBS survey among Dutch manufacturers and is intended to provide</p>
<p>a reliable picture of how Dutch manufacturing production will</p>
<p>develop in the coming four to five months.</p>
<p>The index is calculated from manufacturers' answers to three</p>
<p>questions about the expected level of business activity in the</p>
<p>coming three months, the level of orders on their books and the</p>
<p>level of their stocks of finished products.</p>
<p>Starting with the February data, the CBS has recalculated</p>
<p>the index according to a new method, making it directly</p>
<p>comparable to its consumer confidence indicator. </p>
<p>The data is adjusted for structurally recurring distortions</p>
<p>and seasonal influences and the final figure is calculated as</p>
<p>the mathematical average of the three component series.</p>
<p>The index has no base date.</p>
<p>Providers of professional services expect turnover and</p>
<p>employment to further improve in the second quarter, the CBS</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>The CBS said that -- despite a slightly lower indicator for</p>
<p>industrial entrepreneurs -- these entrepeneurs were still</p>
<p>optimistic, as business confidence has been above the average</p>
<p>level of 1995 and 1996 since December 1996.</p>
