<p>South Korean vehicle maker Hyundai is planning to build a bus assembly plant in one of the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania, Estonian newspaper Aripaev said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It quoted Tarmo Nuut, managing director of the Satex-Auto Hyundai dealership in Estonia, as saying that Hyundai would launch the plant sometime in 1999 but has not yet chosen the location. Nuut was not available to confirm the report, which gave no figures for the planned investment.</p>
<p>He was quoted as saying that the plant would assemble small buses of between 16 to 24 seats.</p>
<p>A similar plant in Korea turns out around 28 such buses a day, Nuut added.</p>
<p>He said that Hyundai was considering a move to the Baltics as the European Union (EU) was planning to introduce taxes on vehicles produced outside the EU in 2000.</p>
<p>Estonia is not a member of the EU but is one of the many former Communist bloc states hoping to start accession talks at the beginning of 1998.</p>
<p>Another reason for a Baltic plant is for access to the huge Russian market, Nuut added.</p>
