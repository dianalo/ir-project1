<p>Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak urged Israel on Sunday to implement "faithfully" peace accords with the Palestinians and warned that any delay could undermine Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.</p>
<p>He also called on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resume Middle East settlement talks with Syria and Lebanon, suspended since last year's Israeli elections brought a right-wing government to power.</p>
<p>"Since the (Hebron) agreement was signed, I think Israel should faithfully implement the agreement," the Egyptian leader said, referring to last month's accord on the transfer of most of the West Bank town to Palestinian control.</p>
<p>He told a Davos news conference that negotiation on a final settlement with the Palestinians -- a key point of the Oslo peace accords signed by the previous Israeli government -- should resume on schedule "and in good faith".</p>
<p>"Policies and practices which are illegal and inconsistent with the spirit of peace, such as settlement activities, should be avoided and stopped altogether," Mubarak declared.</p>
<p>The Egyptian leader was speaking before holding his first formal meeting in six months with Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Mubarak, Netanyahu and Arafat are in Davos for the annual World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>The Egyptian leader said in talks with Arafat in Davos on Saturday he found the Palestinian leader "pessimistic" over what he called Israeli stalling. Arafat was meeting Netanyahu in the Swiss mountain resort on Sunday.</p>
<p>Mubarak said it was important to get progress towards opening an airport and a seaport in Gaza, under the control of Arafat's Palestinian Authority, and implement other parts of overall accords on peace in the region.</p>
<p>Such moves were essential for the welfare of ordinary Palestinians "otherwise they will revolt against their regime," said Mubarak, speaking in English.</p>
<p>Any people would rise up against a leader who was not seen to be doing all he could for them, he added in an echo of concerns voiced by other officials in the region that Israeli intransigence could feed radical opposition to Arafat.</p>
<p>"I think good faith in implementing the Hebron agreement, then go through with negotiations on the final status (of Jerusalem), this will remove the suspicion which is existing there" between Israel and the Syrians and Lebanese, he said.</p>
<p>Negotiations "on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks must be resumed without delay" on the basis of the principle of land for peace, said the Egyptian president, who played a key intermediary role in achieving the Hebron accord.</p>
<p>Mubarak said he was ready to continue to work with Netanyahu and recognised that the Israeli leader faced problems within his own government. Some of the current difficulties could have been caused by officials "at lower levels", he said.</p>
