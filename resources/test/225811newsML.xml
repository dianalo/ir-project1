<p>France has deported 91 Africans and Indians under a crackdown on illegal immigration, the Interior Ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>A charter plane left Paris airport on Thursday evening with 38 Malians, 20 Senegalese and 13 Moroccans aboard, a ministry statement said. The deportees included 24 people recently freed from jail as well as illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Another 20 Indian illegal immigrants had been sent home on scheduled flights earlier this week after officials uncovered a ring organising illegal immigration, it said.</p>
<p>The plane to the three African states was the 31st such charter since Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre took office in May 1995 pledging a tough line.</p>
<p>"Over the past 19 months, the policy of fighting illegal immigration is showing positive results," the ministry said.</p>
<p>The ministry said France had deported 19,396 foreigners since Debre took office. So far this year, 1,083 employers of illegal workers and 35 clandestine workshops had been closed.</p>
