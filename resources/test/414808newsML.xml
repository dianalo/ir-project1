<p>President Bill Clinton on Monday criticised Israel's decision to build new housing for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem during a meeting with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat that focused on the issue.</p>
<p>"I would have preferred the decision not have been made because I don't think it builds confidence. I think it builds mistrust," Clinton told reporters at the start of a one-hour 20-minute Oval Office meeting with Arafat.</p>
<p>But in his public remarks Clinton gave no indication of what, if anything, he might do to try to influence the Israelis to change their decision on the matter, which has sparked strong protests by Palestinians.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government decided last week to build 6,500 homes for Jews on Jabal Abu Ghneim, a pine-covered hill between Jerusalem and Bethlehem known by Israelis as Har Homa.</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East War and views the entire city as its capital, but the Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of a future state.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters after the meeting the issue was prominent during the discussion.</p>
<p>"They talked at great length ... on the Israeli decision to build Har Homa," McCurry said. "The chairman was clearly very concerned and emotional on the subject and the president certainly understood the basis for that emotion."</p>
<p>McCurry, who said Clinton and Arafat met for an hour with their advisers in the Oval Office and then for 20 minutes by themselves, avoided saying whether the United States might seek to change the Israeli stance on the matter.</p>
<p>"We try to get both parties to understand the texture of their differences, the need for dialogue on some of the fundamentally important questions," he said, adding: "There is no issue that is more sensitive than Jerusalem."</p>
<p>Arafat's visit to the White House was his first since last October, when Clinton met with him and Netanyahu in an effort to revive talks over Israel's much-delayed partial troop withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>Clinton, noting Israel and the Palestinians came to terms on that troop redeployment, said at the start of the meeting this was a similarly challenging period for the peace process.</p>
<p>"Because of the efforts that he (Arafat) made in working with the Israelis, an agreement was reached, a timetable was established and we're moving forward," Clinton said. "This is also a difficult moment but I think we can work through it and go forward."</p>
<p>In January, Israel and the Palestinians reached an accord on Hebron in which the right-wing Israeli government agreed for the first time to hand over territory Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East War to PLO rule.</p>
<p>Arafat said on Monday he believed Israel wanted to build the housing to isolate East Jerusalem and appeared to suggest that Israel was seeking to extend its influence toward the town of Bethlehem, now under a form of Palestinian self-rule.</p>
<p>Asked at the start of the meeting if Israel was seeking with the new housing to make annexation of East Jerusalem a fait accompli, Arafat replied: "Not only for Jerusalem, but also for Bethlehem."</p>
<p>"Because their target is to squeeze and to isolate Jerusalem but (at) the same time to build the settlements (at) the entrance of Bethlehem," Arafat said.</p>
<p>As he left the White House, Arafat said his talks with Clinton were constructive, but deferred further comment until after a meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.</p>
<p>Arafat's meeting with Clinton was part of a group of U.S. visits by Middle East leaders. Netanyahu came to Washington to see Clinton last month, and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein were scheduled to do so this month.</p>
