<p>The Polish bourse eased on Tuesday, falling for the fourth session running, and analysts said the market had a limited near-term upside, still looking fairly valued after the recent falls.</p>
<p>"Lots of non-bank stocks in the middle of last week had reached higher prices than at the WIG's local (18,339.4-point) high at the end of February...so share prices are appropriate," said Cezary Markiewicz, an analyst at Bank Gdanski brokerage.</p>
<p>Analysts said Friday's central bank decision to increase mandatory reserves on zloty term deposits from April 30 was hurting the market mood, banks especially.</p>
<p>But they said banks' falls could soon slow, with bourse prices in that sector already having been significantly lowered by the central bank's first-quarter decision to raise mandatory reserves on zloty call deposits and on currency deposits.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index eased 0.1 percent to 16,299.3 points and turnover fell 11.3 percent to 144.6 million zlotys ($45.7 million) on all three markets. Gainers led losers by 36 to 33 with 26 stocks flat.</p>
<p>Bank Gdanski was the biggest loser among banks on Tuesday, down 3.5 percent with stronger buying after price fixing, and BPH, the only bank to fall in continuous trade, had stronger post-price-fixing buying in regular trade.</p>
<p>They said top gainer Espebepe could extend its 9.7 percent gain after the ailing construction firm's biggest creditor on Monday said there was still room for a compromise on a debt reduction deal before Espebepe creditors meet in May.</p>
<p>Analysts also said mass privatisation NFI units, down 2.9 percent, should begin to slow their recent fall after the finance ministry's decision last Thursday to scrap in 1998 the corporate tax exemption NFIs enjoy on gains from selling firms in their portfolios.</p>
