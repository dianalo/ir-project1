<p>Japan's cabinet on Wednesday endorsed a final state budget plan for the next fiscal year, with an emphasis on cutting debt rather than economic recovery.</p>
<p>"This is the first step towards improving our fiscal finances. We have established the 1997/98 state budget as the first year for carrying out fiscal reforms and have severely suppressed general spending and reduced bond issues by 4.3 trillion yen ($37.7 billion)," the government outline said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has said that 1997/98 (April-March) will be the first year of fiscal reforms, in an overall plan to complete administrative reforms by 2001.</p>
<p>The budget draft will be sent to the next regular session of the parliament, starting in January, for approval.</p>
<p>The final plan sets a budget of 77.39 trillion yen for the fiscal year, up 3.0 percent from the original budget for 1996/97, which in turn was 5.8 percent larger than the original budget for 1995/96.</p>
<p>Japan will issue 16.71 trillion yen worth of government bonds to help finance the budget, of which 7.47 trillion yen will be deficit-financing bonds and 9.24 trillion yen will be construction bonds.</p>
<p>Deficit-financing bonds, unlike construction bonds used mainly for infrastructure projects, are issued to fund shortfalls of current administrative costs and need parliamentary approval.</p>
<p>The ministry allocated a record 21.03 trillion yen worth of new government bonds in 1996/97, of which around 12 trillion yen were deficit-financing bonds.</p>
<p>A government advisory panel has urged the government to cut its annual fiscal deficit to below three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) by 2005, a target expected to be officially adopted.</p>
<p>The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) expects Japan's fiscal deficit for calendar 1997 to be 6.3 percent of its GDP. Japan's nominal GDP stood at 488.5 trillion yen in the year to March, 1996.</p>
<p>Tax revenues are estimated at 57.8 trillion yen in 1997/98, up 12.6 percent from this fiscal year's original budget.</p>
<p>The big increase is mainly due to a rise in the consumption tax to five percent from three percent in April, an end to special income tax cuts from January and expected economic growth of 1.9 percent in fiscal 1997/98.</p>
<p>On the expenditure side, the draft budget allocated 16.8 trillion yen for debt servicing, up 2.6 percent from the original 1996/97 budget.</p>
<p>General spending, the core of the budget, will total 43.81 trillion yen, up 1.5 percent from the amount earmarked in the original 1996/97 budget, the lowest growth since 1989/90.</p>
<p>Tokyo will raise defence spending by 2.1 percent to 4.95 trillion yen in 1997/98.</p>
<p>Japan, the world's top aid donor, plans to increase funding for its official development assistance programme by 2.1 percent to 1.17 trillion yen.</p>
<p>Public works spending will grow only slightly, whereas in the past the government has spent large sums to help its economy recover from a slump that started with the bursting of the late 1980s "bubble economy" of inflated asset prices.</p>
<p>Social security costs and funds for nurturing new technologies also made up a large part of the increase in general spending.</p>
<p>Separately from the general account budget, the government's loan and investment programme -- funded by postal insurance, postal savings and other public funds -- will be 39.33 trillion yen in 1997/98, down 3.0 percent from this year. ($1=114 yen)</p>
