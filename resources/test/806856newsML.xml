<p>The United States is at work on new or modified designs for nuclear arms, even though the Cold War is over, the New York Times reported on Monday, citing a formerly secret Energy Department document.</p>
<p>The document shows that the United Staets is undermining a treaty intended to halt innovations in making weapons of mass destruction, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Energy Department officials denied the assertion, saying the work complied with the international treaty. The officials said the work was only to modernize old weapon designs, according to the newspaper.</p>
<p>The document said the work exercises a broad range of design skills, including steps toward redesigning the heart of the hydrogen bomb, the paper said.</p>
<p>The document was obtained by the Natural Resources Defense Council -- a private Washington group that advocates arms control -- and turned over to the Times, the newspaper said.</p>
