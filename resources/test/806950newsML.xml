<p>Greek shares tracked the performance of major international bourses on Monday on the back of Wall Street's weak show on Friday, but strength in OTE telecom helped limit overall losses.</p>
<p>"Trading volume remains meagre amidst the peak of the summer holiday season and prices sway easily under the influence of external factors," said Athanasios Trikatzis, broker at Hermes Brokerage.</p>
<p>News of a 3.11 percent fall in Wall Street stocks on Friday, the combined result of concerns for a falling dollar and corporate profits, was closely monitored by local market participants and was cited as a reason for Monday's drift in the Athens bourse's benchmark index.</p>
<p>Nervousness in foreign equity markets took its toll on Greek stocks which remain directionless within a narrow trading range around 1,600 points, Trikatzis said.</p>
<p>"I think investors used the conditions in international markets as an excuse to take profits on a quiet 100-point rise of the benchmark index in recent days on practically no fresh news," said a fund manager who wished to keep his anonymity.</p>
<p>The market remains vibrant and investor interest in equities is rather high, the fund manager added.</p>
<p>The Athens benchmark index lost 1.39 percent or 22.91 points at 1,622.90 from Thursday's 1,638.47 close.</p>
<p>All sector sub-indices settled lower. Industrials led the market with a 2.03 percent drop, with banks softening 1.54 percent.</p>
<p>Turnover reached 7.8 billion drachmas on volume of 1.8 million shares, including a block of 30,000 shares of Alpha Credit Bank traded at 20,000 drachmas.</p>
<p>Decliners beat advancers 149 to 46 with 14 shares unchanged on 209 traded.</p>
