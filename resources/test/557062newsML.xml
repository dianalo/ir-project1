<text>
<p>Rotterdam bunkers edged higher on Friday, but the move was a modest $1 a tonne, against the $2 rise of the barge market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Rotterdam bunkers were quoted at around $85 fob. Larger players picked up most of the business below that level. Some players, mainly independents, said they were unable to offer at lower than $86 fob.</p>
<p>"The big sellers were offering at incredibly low numbers compared with the ex-wharf numbers," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Total ARA volume exceeded 10,000 tonnes, including a couple of larger enquiries.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices were barely changed. Morning trading was reasonably busy before an afternoon lull.</p>
<p>Mediterranean barges also barely moved. Trading was quiet. Spanish suppliers remained on holiday.</p>
<p>Egyptian prices edged slightly higher. Supplies were good in all ports except Alexandria.</p>
