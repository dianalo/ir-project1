<p>Poland's Constitutional Tribunal rejected on Wednesday new laws which gave control of great tracts of land, estimated to be worth more than $1 billion in Warsaw alone, to a society of garden allotment holders.</p>
<p>PAP news agency said the Tribunal, which ensures new laws conform with the constitution, ruled against amendments passed by parliament last year, which evoked outraged protests from city authorities including those of the capital.</p>
<p>The legislation, backed by the ruling left-wing coalition, handed hosts of the small, lovingly-tended gardens used by almost a million Poles on a 99-year-lease to the Polish Association of Allotment Holders.</p>
<p>The Tribunal ruled that last year's law excessively infringed local authorities' ownership rights and it rejected the decision to grant control to only one group, PAP said.</p>
<p>The gardens provide a treasured weekend escape for residents of cramped urban apartments and help low-income families or pensioners, who grow food or flowers for sale.</p>
<p>The new law was designed to safeguard the holders, who had been renting their plots from the municipalities.</p>
<p>But city councils say that they have effectively been stripped of their ownership and that, while wishing to preserve such gardens, they need to use some of the land for important development projects -- with due compensation to gardeners.</p>
<p>Warsaw city President Marcin Swiecicki told Reuters before the ruling that in Warsaw's central district alone the issue concerned about 400 hectares (1000 acres) of land, at a time when prime sites were commanding up to $1,000 a square metre.</p>
<p>He said that, even if the land value was assessed far lower, "400 hectares reaches a value of more than $1 billion, in the city centre."</p>
<p>Warsaw is promoting a building boom as part of a bid to become a regional business centre, and is encouraging office and other construction in open spaces, some of which remain since German invaders levelled the city in World War Two.</p>
<p>Mayor Swiecicki said he understood how people valued allotments spaces and wanted them to last as long as possible.</p>
<p>But he said that among vital projects affected by the amendments was a plan for a key new road, a proposal to build a European University campus on land currently occupied by allotments on the central Mokotow fields and a sewage project.</p>
<p>"The city owns the land and should benefit from it," he said.</p>
<p>The Warsaw mayor's office said it had no immediate statement after the Tribunal ruling, which could be over-ruled if the amendment's supporters muster a two-thirds majority in parliament.</p>
