<p>China's first seven-year treasury bond made a disappointing debut on the Shanghai stock exchange on Thursday, becoming the first T-bond this year to trade below its issue price of 100 yuan.</p>
<p>The bond opened at 99.90 yuan and soon hit an intra-day low of 98.53 yuan before recovering slightly. It ended at 98.60 yuan, after hitting a high of 99.99 yuan.</p>
<p>Traders said the bond, bearing a higher coupon than bank interest rates, had been hurt by Beijing's demand for tighter liquidity with the approach of the year-end and a bull run on China's stock markets.</p>
<p>The People's Bank of China, the central bank, has instructed state banks and financial institutions to maintain tight money supply with the approach of the year-end, which has reduced liquidity flowing into the T-bond spot market, they said.</p>
<p>The bond, the last issue of China's state debt this year, has a coupon of 8.56 percent, 1.09 percentage points higher than the annual rate of 7.47 percent for one-year bank deposits.</p>
<p>A total of 20 billion yuan worth of the seven-year T-bond was issued from November 1 to Wednesday, bringing total T-bill and T-bond issues in China this year to a record 220 billion yuan.  </p>
<p>But traders said that, after Thursday's fall, the room for further losses would be limited due to the bond's high returns.</p>
