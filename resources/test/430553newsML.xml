<headline>OPTIONS - US debt volatilities ease in dull trade.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Implied volatilities for U.S. fixed income options were easier in late trade as underlying markets bounced off early lows after a Federal Reserve coupon pass operation, dealers said.</p>
<p>Time-decay concerns kept traders wary of bidding up options, with no important economic indicators out today and the week's more important data, such as February retail sales and producer prices, not due for a few more days, they added.</p>
<p>"We're trading in a half-point range again," a brokerage T-bond trader at the Chicago Board of Trade said of the lackluster activity in the bond market.  </p>
<p>Traders said the dull underlying market activity weighed particularly on shorter-dated options.</p>
<p>Implied volatility for CBOT April T-bond futures options, which expire in less than two weeks, lost more than half a point from Friday's close to about 8.6 percent. June was off about 0.2 point at 9.4 percent.</p>
<p>There were only a handful of sizable deals, with one bank selling some 3,000 contracts of April 110 calls and another selling 2,000 June 112 calls.</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon, the bond market staged a brief rally on news Fed bought $1.117 billion of Treasury coupons.  </p>
<p>June T-bond futures, which had been grinding lower, clawed back above the 110-00 barrier on the news.</p>
<p>A Eurodollar trader at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange said, however, that the coupon pass was not enough to boost the market's dampened sentiment.</p>
<p>"The market was certainly under pressure before it (coupon pass) came out," he said. "But there's no follow-through. I think the majority of people want to sell on an uptick."</p>
<p>Traders expected futures to be range-bound and option volatilities to be subdued near-term as the market awaited the March 25 Federal Open Market Committee meeting.  </p>
<p>"The FOMC meeting isn't for another two weeks," the CME trader said. "So I guess we're going to do the things we do before big events."</p>
<p>Implied volatilities for June, September and December Eurodollar futures options were down 0.1-0.2 point each to 9.8, 12.9 and 14.5 percent respectively.</p>
<p>Among the bigger deals, an investment bank was seen selling 2,000 contracts of September 94.25 puts, while a second bank bought 2,000 June 93.75 puts. A third bank sold 1,000 of short-June 93.75 straddles. Short-Junes are options expiring in June 1997 but priced from June 1998 futures.</p>
