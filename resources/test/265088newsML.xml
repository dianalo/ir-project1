<p>The British Treasury on Wednesday published a new draft of its Building Societies Bill which will remove the immunity from takeover of those societies that convert to bank status if they, in turn, perform takeovers.</p>
<p>The five-year immunity would be lost if any society that converts and floats on the stock exchange, and there are four in the pipeline, buys a bank, building society, insurance company or friendly society. Immunity is not affected by purchasing mortgage books or by joint ventures, however.</p>
<p>The Treasury said the bulk of the bill which refers to those societies who remain mutually owned will make them more able to compete with banks and give them more freedom to provide the best service to customers.</p>
<p>"The societies converting to banks will go ahead if that is what their members want," said Treasury Minister Angela Knight in a statement.</p>
<p>"When converted they will be allowed to establish themselves. But if they want to play the takeover game then they will have to play by the same rules as everyone else," she added.</p>
<p>Britain's largest building society the Halifax plans to convert and float next year as do the Alliance &amp; Leicester, Woolwich, and Northern Rock.</p>
<p>The Treasury said it has amended one of the proposed measures in the bill which also affects converting societies.</p>
<p>Under current company law, 10 percent of shareholders can call a special general meeting of the company and this will not change for converting societies. But any proposal to waive its five-year immunity to takeover, which would allow a bid, will have to be approved by 75 percent of the voting shareholders.</p>
<p>Some societies had criticised the Treasury's proposals because they did not allow friendly takeovers, such as between one large society and a local smaller one.</p>
<p>"We came to the conclusion that the distinction between friendly and hostile takeovers was too difficult to define and that it would have been unworkable," a Treasury spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Building societies have traditionally been the largest mortgage lenders in Britain and have mostly been mutually owned.</p>
<p>Up to now, only one building society has converted to bank status, Abbey National in 1990.</p>
<p>"Building societies are a vital cog in the machinery of high street finance. They offer top notch service within their distinctive mutual framework. That is why I want to ensure they continue to flourish now and long into the future," Knight said.</p>
<p>The Halifax has assets of over 100 billion pounds ($167 billion) while the other three have combined assets of over 70 billion.</p>
