<p>Argentina's state pension and health service PAMI loses $40 million a month to fraudulent claims by 90,000 nonexistent retirees, according to an independent audit quoted by local newspapers Monday.</p>
<p>A private audit commissioned by the PAMI's administrator Alejandro Bramer Markovic also denounced that PAMI suffers from staff absenteeism averaging 25 percent a day and that 35 percent of its registered clinics either do not exist or cannot be located, Clarin and La Nacion reported.  </p>
<p>PAMI also pays an average $350 for each time it sends out an ambulance, compared with the $18 the service should really cost, according to the audit.</p>
<p>The auditor said it was not clear how much of the PAMI's problems were due to inefficiency and how much to fraud.</p>
<p>The cash-strapped PAMI services 4.3 million pensioners, most of whom receive very low monthly payments which do not reflect the amount of money they paid into the system during their working lives.</p>
<p>PAMI spends $250 million a month and runs up a monthly deficit of $52 million. Its debts total $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>No PAMI spokesman was immediately available for comment.</p>
