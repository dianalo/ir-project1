<p>CBOT rice closed firm on short covering tied to signs futures were oversold, traders said.</p>
<p>"It was mainly an upward correction from an oversold situation," a trader said.</p>
<p>Rice futures this week dropped on increased harvesting of the U.S. crop, a weak tone in cash markets and reports the benchmark Thai price dropped $10.00 per tonne to close the week at near $335.00 per tonne, they said.</p>
<p>Rice futures closed 1/2 to 2-1/2 cents per cwt higher, with September up 1/2 at $10.07 per cwt.</p>
<p>The market this week also was hit by slow exports. But Friday U.S. export sources said Ivory Coast bought 26,516 tonnes of U.S. No 2 long grain brown rice under PL480.</p>
<p>"We broke to the downside this week and below a two-week consolidation level," a trader said.</p>
<p>He said the market has correctly anticipated the fact of increased supplies of high grade rice in Asia.</p>
<p>"The second Thai crop was high quality which increased the exportable supplies there," the trader said.</p>
<p>Rice futures volume was estimated at 650 contracts, down from 1,031 Thursday. Rice options volume was estimated at 10 contracts, down from 45 Thursday.</p>
