<p>The world's largest commercial aircraft maker, Boeing Co, said on Thursday its profits climbed 13 percent in the third quarter as it sold more planes and realised greater interest income.</p>
<p>Boeing said its net income for the three months ended September 30 climbed to $254 million, or 74 cents a share, from $225 million, or 66 cents a share.</p>
<p>The per-share results were a penny ahead of Wall Street estimates of 73 cents, according to First Call, which tracks analyst estimates.</p>
<p>Boeing said its revenues soared to $5.60 billion from $4.38 billion as it delivered a total of 54 airliners, up from 51 in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>Boeing said its sales increase was slightly offset by higher research and development costs associated with developing derivatives of its 737 airliner and a higher income tax rate.</p>
<p>For the first nine months net income soared to $841 million, or $2.44 a share, from $175 million, or 51 cents a share, a year ago, when the company took a $600 million charge related to an employee retirement programme.</p>
<p>Revenues for the first nine months rose to $16.17 billion from $14.98 billion, although the company delivered only 156 airplanes, down from 170 a year ago.</p>
<p>The company said the profit increase for the period was principally due to the settlement of various defence and space segment contract issues, resulting in an $81 million after-tax increase in net income.</p>
<p>Boeing said it continued to project total 1996 deliveries of 215 airplanes with sales projected to be in the $22 billion range, compared with $19.5 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>It also said that, based on current programmes and schedules, research and development expense for the full year will be about $1.2 billion, down from $1.3 billion last year.</p>
<p>The company said its effective income tax rate of 18.0 percent for the first nine months reflected recognition of a one-time tax benefit of $95 million related to prior years' investment tax credits.</p>
<p>The company had an 8.4 percent income tax rate for 1995, the result of the $600 million pretax charge for the retirement programme and the recognition of significant research and experimentation tax credits.</p>
