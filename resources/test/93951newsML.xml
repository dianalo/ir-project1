<p>Prospects that China may resume exporting limited quantities of corn left U.S. agriculture experts and grain industry officials unruffled this week, and surprised only that it hasn't happened sooner.</p>
<p>"It certainly would not be a surprise to the international grain trade," said Mike Callahan, head of Asian operations for the U.S. Feed Grains Council, a private export promotion group for U.S. crops. "China is sitting on a lot of grain," he said.</p>
<p>"It's been talked about for months and months ... we had expected them to do it earlier," said an Agriculture Department official who did not want to be identified.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed reports circulated early this week that the Chinese government is considering allowing up to two million metric tons of corn to be exported this year from its No. 1 corn-producing province of Jilin in northeast China.</p>
<p>Agricultural experts said that while China might displace some U.S. corn in foreign markets, it would not have that much of an impact on crop prices or the total export picture.</p>
<p>Grain experts speculated that most of the Chinese corn would go into South Korea, and also some to Indonesia and Malaysia. They said while this would cut into the 52 million tons of corn estimated to be exported this year by the United States, the impacts would be marginal given the tight grain stocks in the United States and strong prices.</p>
<p>"There would still be good demand for U.S. corn in other parts of Asia, and also Latin America," said Callahan. "And if we didn't get it all exported, it wouldn't be so bad if we built up stocks a little here."</p>
<p>Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman told reporters earlier this week that he has not received official confirmation of a change in Chinese policy, but senior officials said the agency is "actively pursuing" the reports.</p>
<p>Grain industry officials said the news was an interesting turn of events, but not totally unexpected.</p>
<p>As recently as three years ago, China was the world's second-largest corn exporter -- behind only the United States and selling almost 12 million tons of corn to neighbouring Asian countries. China did not buy any foreign-grown corn.</p>
<p>But in 1994 China suddenly pulled almost completely out of the corn export market and turned its attention to feeding its people, whose incomes and appetites have been whetted by the fast-growing economy and booming development throughout the country.</p>
<p>The Chinese government slapped restrictions on corn exports, and over the next two years China instead became an importer of corn -- buying almost five million tons from foreign sources, with over two-thirds from the United States.</p>
<p>Two back-to-back record Chinese grain harvests, however, have cut the country's need for foreign-grown crops this year and have increased pressure on the government to relax its restrictions on exports.</p>
<p>Reports released Thursday from Asian traders who just returned from a tour of China's northeast growing regions were that China is on track to meet official projections for total 1996 grain output of a record 475 to 480 million metric tons.</p>
<p>Traders expect China's corn crop to be a record 115 to 120 million tons, based on increased acreage and increased yields. In Jilin, the corn production should be 17.1 million tons, up from last year's 14.98 million tons.</p>
<p>The U.S. government is pegging the Chinese corn crop at 114 million tons, but could change its numbers next Friday when the Agriculture Department releases new estimates.</p>
<p>Most analysts said China will not return to the days of big corn exports, but could ship limited quantities from its more productive regions to relieve spot surpluses and import foreign grain for its deficit areas.</p>
