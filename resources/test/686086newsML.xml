<p>Eastman Kodak Co., facing severe price pressure from Fuji Photo Film Co. Ltd., named a new management team for its consumer film unit Wednesday.</p>
<p>Henri Petit, head of the company's European, African and Middle Eastern region, and Patrick Siewert, chairman of the greater China region, will share the office of chief operating officer of Kodak's consumer film business, the company said.</p>
<p>They succeed Alexander Wasilov, who will become head of the greater China region. Kodak said the moves were made to improve global focus and worldwide strategies.</p>
<p>David Biehn will remain president of the consumer film unit, the company said.</p>
<p>"Petit and Siewert have excellent track records in driving results in the face of challenging business opportunities," said Daniel Carp, Kodak president.</p>
<p>"Siewert's career responsibilities have taken him from the U.S. and Canada, to Europe and now China. Petit combines his own international credentials with a record of business success. He understands traditional photography and digital imaging both as a technologist and general manager," Carp said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the move was meant to improve results at the film unit, which is Kodak's largest business.</p>
<p>"I think it is very likely that (Kodak) is not satisfied with the performance (of the unit) as of late and is changing players in an effort to right the ship, provide fresh perspective and achieve better performance," one analyst said.</p>
<p>"Though I think this business with Fuji is somewhat exaggerated, the fact remains that the stock has taken a hit, and (Kodak) may believe it's time to make a change."</p>
<p>Kodak stock hit a high of about $94 in mid-February. It ended unchanged at $77.50 on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kodak executives declined to comment on the speculation and said that the moves had been in the works for months.</p>
<p>"This is something that was embarked upon quite some time ago as part of our ongoing career development," Wasilov said during a telephone interview with the three executives.</p>
<p>Siewert said he disagreed with some analysts' view of the changes. "I don't believe it is a reaction to performance at all. There are always areas that you look at, but I don't foresee any dramatic changes (in the unit) initially."</p>
<p>One analyst agreed with Kodak's view of the situation.</p>
<p>"I don't necessarily buy that idea. They didn't change the head of the consumer unit," said Smith Barney analyst Peter Enderlin. "They clearly felt the need for more management. (Wasilov) just needed help," he said, noting the unit accounts for half of Kodak's annual sales of $16 billion.</p>
<p>"It's just too big for one guy to manage," he said.</p>
<p>Petit said he planned to continue building on what the consumer film unit has accomplished. "We'll look at it from a global perspective. The U.S. is only one market, albeit a very important one, but we will continue to strive to find ways to grow, to continue to grow" the business, he said.</p>
<p>The appointments, effective Sept. 1, follow Kodak's move last week to drop long-time advertising agency J. Walter Thompson from its consumer film business for Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide. Siewert said Ogilvy &amp; Mather won the account by responding to the film's brand needs over the past two years.</p>
