<p>Shares in Mercury Asset Management Group Plc tumbled by more than two percent on Thursday after the company warned that its strong rate of profit growth may not be sustainable, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said there had also been disappointment at the final dividend of 35.0p per share, and that the company, which posted profits at the top end of analysts' forecasts, did not issue a share buyback.</p>
<p>The stock, which hit a record at 1452p on May 13, was down 32-1/2p to 1409p at 0747 GMT.</p>
<p>"The (financial) sector has had a super run, so it's not surprising to see the shares fall," said one dealer.</p>
<p>"They might have been down more than they are, but there are some shorts out there that need to be covered and it think that's what's holding the market," he added. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 5106</p>
