<p>Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber testified in Manhattan federal court on Thursday that he was irreperably harmed by a 1978 religous song he claims was stolen from his score for "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat."</p>
<p>His testimony capped the hard-fought, six-year legal battle between the composer of "Cats" and "Jesus Christ Superstar" and Ray Repp, who developed the Catholic folk mass.</p>
<p>Repp sued Lloyd Webber in 1990, claiming that the theme from 1987's "Phantom of the Opera" was based on his song "Till You." Repp lost that case, but Lloyd Webber proceeded with a counter-suit contending that "Till You" was stolen from the song "Close Every Door," written by Lloyd Webber and then-partner Tim Rice for "Joseph" in 1967.</p>
<p>LLoyd Webber sued for $500,000 in damages, but later records revealed "Till You" earned only $75 in the years the suit covers.</p>
<p>Repp's attorney William Coulson asked Lloyd Webber whether, as one of the most successful composers in the world, he had been "irreperably harmed" by the $75 song.</p>
<p>"Why, yes," Lloyd Webber responded.</p>
<p>Jane Stevens, lead trial attorney for Lloyd Webber, contends the case is over authorship, not money. They no long are seeking damages, but want to forbid Repp from playing "Till You" in public.</p>
<p>Court records show Lloyd Webber's attorneys asked a Catholic priest who helped publish Repp's work if he was having a love affair with Repp.</p>
<p>Stevens defended the question as showing possible bias. She also said she sent a private investigator to take pictures of the same priest's house to only determine his financial status.</p>
<p>But Coulson said the purpose was to intimidate his clients "to convince them to go away." He said opposing attorneys offered to drop their case if Repp did not appeal his suit.</p>
<p>Lloyd Webber said he counter-sued on his lawyers' advice, but did not listen to "Till You" until 1992, a year later. He said he was "struck immediately" by the similarities.</p>
<p>"Good heavens", he recalled having said after he heard a particular part of the song. "That's the thing these three songs have in common."</p>
