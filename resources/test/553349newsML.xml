<p>Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov, recovering from an attempt on his life, will have to undergo a second operation to remove all the shrapnel from a leg wound, the Tajik authorities said on Thursday.</p>
<p>An official in Rakhmonov's administration was unable to say when the new surgery on the president's right leg would take place.</p>
<p>"Surgeons operated for about an hour but they failed to remove all the shrapnel," said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>Presidential spokesman Zafar Saidov said two people were killed and 72 were injured in the attack, which occurred when Rakhmonov visited the northern town of Khudjand on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rakhmonov, 45, had a grenade thrown at his feet as he got out of a car. He was wounded in the legs but was able to limp down the steps from his aircraft when he returned to the capital Dushanbe late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The official said Rakhmonov would not work for a week. "The president's health is normal but he must rest for a week," he said.</p>
<p>Tajikistan, a former Soviet republic, is still reeling from a four-year civil war in which tens of thousands of people died. Armed groups still roam the mountain state, which borders Afghanistan and China.</p>
<p>The government has condemned the attack as a "terrorist act" but has so far not blamed any one group for the attempt on Rakhmonov's life. "This (attack) was a struggle for power," was all Saidov would say.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Tajikistan's armed Islamic opposition, Rakhmonov's main foe in the civil war, told Reuters the group had had nothing to do with the attack.</p>
<p>A source at the National Revival of Tajikistan bloc, part of the republic's so-called "third" political force and based around Khudjand, also denied any involvement.</p>
<p>"This was not a political action but a criminal one," the source said. The bloc was excluded from a power-sharing arrangement tentatively agreed by the government and the Islamic opposition in February.</p>
<p>Diplomats and opposition sources say the attack could be revenge for the government's violent crushing of a prison riot in Khudjand earlier this month, which left 20 dead.</p>
<p>The riot leaders and Rakhmonov's would-be assassin, arrested on Wednesday immediately after the attack, was said by the authorities to have been involved in an anti-government demonstration in May last year.</p>
