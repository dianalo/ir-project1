<p>State-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC) has bought through tender its second cargo of 25,000-tonnes of 87-octane leaded gasoline for June at over $30 per tonne over Mideast naphtha quotes, a source close to IOC said on Monday.</p>
<p>The source said the premium was in the "low $30s" and lower than rumours on Friday of around $38.</p>
<p>The tender closed June 11 and was valid for a day.  </p>
<p>The award, on a cost-and-freight (c+f) basis to Bombay on the west coast for delivery June 26-30, was also much lower than than IOC's first purchase in June at $43 per tonne over Mideast naphtha quotes, c+f Bombay June 18-22, the source said.</p>
<p>IOC had sought the second June cargo due to a product shortfall caused by the five-day emergency shutdown on June 2 of the 150,000 barrels-per-day state refiner Cochin Refineries Ltd.</p>
