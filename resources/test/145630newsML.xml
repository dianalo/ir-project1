<p>Australian Open champion Boris Becker on Saturday joined Pete Sampas and Andre Agassi in calling for the Davis Cup to be played less frequently because it was placing too much stress on the players.</p>
<p>Sampras and Agassi said earlier this week the prestigious team competition should be played every two years instead of every year because it was losing value in the crowded tennis calendar.</p>
<p>Becker added: "Officials need to think about this quickly. There is stress with the flights and you only have one body."</p>
<p>World number one Sampras said the Cup, which has been contested for most of the century, was being "degraded" because many top players skipped ties because they did not fit into their playing schedules -- including himself.</p>
<p>"I have always thought it should be more like the Ryder Cup (in golf) which is played every two years," Sampras said at the Stuttgart Open. "There is too much tennis... The Davis Cup can get lost in the shuffle."</p>
<p>Neither Sampras nor Agassi played a role in United States' ties this year. As reigning champions, the Americans failed to make it to the semifinals after crashing out to the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Speaking after his semifinal victory in Stuttgart, Becker said players had problems fitting in the ties, played in February, April, September and November/December, into their schedules because they could take place in any part of the world.</p>
<p>The knock-out Davis Cup competition is played over three days with four singles matches and a doubles rubber. The event dates back to 1902 when the United States took on the British Isles.</p>
