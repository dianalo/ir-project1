<p>South African mining group Gencor Ltd is poised to announce a London listing for its aluminium, coal and metals businesses valued at around $7.0 billion, the Financial Times said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that the group's precious metals operations would remain part of a separate business to be listed in Johannesburg.</p>
<p>The unsourced report said the demerger would mark the culmination of Gencor's transformation into an international metals group.</p>
<p>It said all Gencor's base metals businesses were likely to be grouped into the London-listed company.</p>
