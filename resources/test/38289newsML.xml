<p>Wessex Water is confident of maintaining the momentum of cost cuts in its water business and therefore reducing charges to customers, chairman Nicholas Hood told the annual meeting.</p>
<p>He said the proposed takeover of South West Water would bring "considerable benefits," but added that the company would not make a bid if regulatory and competition requirements were too demanding.</p>
<p>"Insted, we will proceed with other options to deliver higher returns to shareholders," he said.</p>
<p>Wessex Water's bid for South West Water, along with a rival offer from Severn Trent, is currently being considered by UK competition authorities.</p>
<p>Hood said that no more executive share options wold be granted to directors but that the board was seeking approval to offer a new long term incentive plan to executives.</p>
