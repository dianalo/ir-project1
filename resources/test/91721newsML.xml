<p>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin Wednesday lauded the state of the global economy, saying it was in better shape than it has been in a long time.</p>
<p>In remarks before the annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, Rubin said "the fundamentals of the world economy look as solid as they've been for a long, long time."</p>
<p>He said America too was enjoying solid growth with low inflation. "I believe that if we continue to follow the right policy path in this country, we can have solid growth and low inflation on balance over the long term."  </p>
<p>Rubin told the gathering of 181 countries that much of the success in the recent period reflected what is now a widespread consensus on the best economic policies to follow.</p>
<p>"That consensus is to open markets, not close them, free business to compete, not restrain them, reduce deficits, not sustain them, and invest publicly in people, infrastructure and other areas critical to future productivity," he said.</p>
<p>He said the U.S. was committed to meeting its financial responsibilities to the multilateral lending organizations and pledged the administration's "fullest and upmost effort" to work with Congress to achieve that.  </p>
<p>Rubin praised World Bank President James Wolfensohn and IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus for "lifting the fight against corruption to the top of the agenda."</p>
<p>He called corruption a major impediment to economic development.</p>
<p>Rubin also urged the IMF and Bank to work together to help shore up banking systems in emerging market economies, saying that too often banking problems undermine economic growth.</p>
