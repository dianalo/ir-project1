<p>A Berlin district that wants to name a street after Marlene Dietrich faces years of delay because some Germans still consider the late Hollywood film star a traitor, local government officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The legendary film star and singer was born in west Berlin's Schoeneberg district in 1901, and it wants to rename Tempelhofer Weg, one km (half a mile) long, Marlene-Dietrich-Strasse.</p>
<p>But Dietrich, who left Germany in 1930 and later supported the Allied war effort against the Nazis, got a hostile reception during her last visit home in 1960 and her wartime conduct still provokes resentment.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately there is a small number of people who still see Marlene Dietrich as a traitor because of her work against Nazi Germany," said Otto Edel, a Schoeneberg councillor. "We hope to be able to name the street after her by the year 2002."</p>
<p>Dietrich's film career began in pre-Hitler Germany at the Babelsberg film studios and flourished in the United States.</p>
<p>She arrived in Hollywood in 1930 and took American citizenship in 1939 at the height of her career and the year World War Two broke out. Her signature role was in the 1930 film "The Blue Angel" in which she played a vamp named Lola.</p>
<p>Dietrich was a recluse in her later years and died in Paris in 1992. Her burial in Berlin was marked by controversy and an official civic ceremony was cancelled because of resentment toward her work entertaining Allied troops during World War Two.</p>
<p>In recent years, Dietrich's grave in Berlin has been descrated by vandals. Police once found the words "fur-wearing slut" daubed in red paint on her gravestone.</p>
<p>"Not a thing has changed even today," said Hanns Leske, a leader of the Social Democratic Party's Schoeneberg branch.</p>
<p>"The dispute has reached a point that is damaging the city's image," he told the daily newspaper Der Tagesspiegel.</p>
<p>Dietrich was born near Tempelhofer Weg and Edel said he was confident the Social Democrats and Greens would manage rename the street, due to become a major thoroughfare in the year 2002.</p>
<p>"There will be a lengthy discussion about Marlene Dietrich Strasse and it will take time to push this through," he said. "But I think it will be good for the city to debate openly the issues and the person involved."</p>
