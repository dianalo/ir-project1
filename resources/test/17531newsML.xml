<headline>UPS France to re-organise as losses soar.</headline>

<p>A 1995 loss of 190 million francs has forced United Parcel Service of America Inc's (UPS) France subsidiary to undertake a major reorganisation of its activities in the country, a company official told Reuters.</p>
<p>She said this followed a loss made by UPS France in 1994 of 110 million francs.</p>
<p>But she stressed that no decision has yet been taken on whether or not to pull out of the heavier end of the French airfreight market.</p>
<p>UPS France plans to axe almost 800 jobs and close 17 of its 55 French depots before creating 740 jobs in a new-look company, she said.</p>
<p>"Our existing  operating structure does not give us the necessary scope to be profitable in what has become a highly competitive market," the official said.</p>
<p>UPS France's current activities cover two distinct market sectors -- its "core" business of documents and small parcels, and heavyweight and palletized shipments.</p>
<p>It entered the heavyweight side of the market in France through the purchase of French road distribution group, Prost Transports, in 1991.</p>
<p>The official said no action would be taken on the reorganisation plans until they were discussed with the employees' works committee, which is due to begin consultations with the management on January 30.</p>
<p>She added that while UPS France's intention was to concentrate more on developing documents and small parcel traffic in the foreseeable future, it would continue to provide customers with services at the heavier end of the market.</p>
<p>UPS France employs 2,500 staff in France and operates a fleet of around 1,100 vans and lorries.</p>
<p>In 1995, it tabled a turnover of one billion francs.</p>
<p>UPS currently operates a nightly Boeing 727 freighter rotation linking Lyon with the express delivery company's European hub at Cologne and Barcelona, as well as a nightly Paris CDG-Cologne rotation using a 14-tonne capacity Electra aircraft.</p>
