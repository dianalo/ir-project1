<p>Japan's Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said on Monday that Japan's economy was continuing to recover, although currently at a slow pace.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Japan Society here, Kubo said: "With the demand in the private sector steadily gathering strength, the economy indicates continuous recovery, although at a slow pace."  </p>
<p>Kubo cited encouraging signs in personal consumption, housing construction and investment in plants and equipment. Meanwhile, exports have been hovering around the same level and industrial production is on a gradual increase, Kubo said.</p>
<p>Signs of strength have been confirmed by quarterly gross domestic product figures announced in September, he added.</p>
<p>To ensure continued recovery, Japan stands ready to inject fiscal stimulus into the economy and to press ahead with structural reforms, Kubo added.  </p>
<p>"The government is determined to sustain and strengthen the recovery of the economy by steadily executing the public expenditure (programs) and through early settlement of the nonperforming loans of financial institutions, Kubo added.</p>
<p>Still, Japan will also closely watch its growing public sector deficit caused by recent stimulus efforts, Kubo said.</p>
<p>"We intend to promote the fiscal structural reform with vigor," Kubo said, adding: "We are in the process of formulating a target for fiscal consolidation by studying the experiences of the U.S. and the economic convergence criteria for European monetary union."  </p>
<p>On currencies, Kubo echoed recent comments from U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin heralding the dollar's recent performance, but added that G7 nations should continue to cooperate in the foreign exchange markets.</p>
<p>"The present situation that we are seeing now is something also to be welcomed by the G7 countries and that was the confirmation we had within (weekend G7 meetings)," Kubo said.</p>
<p>"We're talking about the strong dollar." As for a "stronger" dollar, Kubo added, "Well, this is not actually what was meant by the understanding."</p>
<p>"We agreed that we welcome the current moves in the foreign exchange market and that we will continue to keep in touch and cooperate among G7 countries in the currency market," he added.</p>
