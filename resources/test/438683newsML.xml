<p>Penny Hardaway's tough running jumper with 1.1 seconds to go lifted the Orlando Magic to a 96-95 road victory over the Houston Rockets Wednesday.</p>
<p>"He just made a great shot at the end," Orlando coach Richie Adubato said. "Sometimes, it's just better to be lucky than good."</p>
<p>Hardaway finished with 31 points and Gerald Wilkins had 19 for Orlando, which wrapped up its road trip at 4-2 and won for the 10th time in its last 13 games overall. The Magic have won the last six meetings with Houston.</p>
<p>Hakeem Olajuwon recorded 32 points and 12 rebounds but missed a shot that would have put the Rockets up by three just before Hardaway's shot.</p>
<p>"It's a tough loss, we lost the game on some key plays," said Olajuwon. "The jump hook I missed was the kind of shot I make eight out of 10 times and Hardaway's last shot was the kind I block eight out of 10 times. I really thought I had a block."</p>
<p>Kevin Willis added 21 points and 14 rebounds for Houston, which returned from a perfect five-game road swing only to lose at home.</p>
<p>"I'm really baffled about our mental approach at home compared to the road," said Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich. "I don't know if our focus is here."</p>
<p>Horace Grant netted 16 points, Dennis Scott had 14 and Derek Strong pulled down a season-high 13 rebounds for Orlando, which made 20-of-25 free throws. Nick Anderson was a late scratch due to a strained right quadricep tendon and Rony Seikaly did not dress with a lower back strain.</p>
<p>In Indiana, Reggie Miller scored 25 points and Rik Smits added 14 as the Pacers snapped a three-game skid with a 92-82 victory over the Atlanta Hawks.</p>
<p>Dale Davis chipped in 12 points and 10 rebounds for Indiana, which has won five of its last six home games. The Pacers have captured six straight games over Atlanta at home and eight of the last 11 meetings overall.</p>
<p>"Any win for us is a great win now," said Indiana coach Larry Brown. "After the three games we've had, this was a terrific win. We did a lot of good things."</p>
<p>Steve Smith tallied 21 points and Dikembe Mutombo had 16 and 10 boards for the Hawks, who had their five-game winning streak snapped.</p>
<p>"We were a little tired tonight, but that's not an excuse," said Hawks guard Mookie Blaylock. "Indiana came out and played a good ballgame. We missed open shots and just simply did not execute down the stretch."</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Scottie Pippen scored 31 points and Michael Jordan added 22 as the Chicago Bulls defeated the 76ers for the 14th straight time, 108-104.</p>
<p>Bill Wennington had 14 points and Dennis Rodman grabbed 17 rebounds for Chicago, which has won six of its last seven games and improved to 25-7 on the road.</p>
<p>Rookie Allen Iverson matched his career-high with 37 points and Jerry Stackhouse added 19 for the 76ers, who have lost five of their last six games.</p>
<p>At Los Angeles, Elden Campbell scored 26 points and Eddie Jones added 24 as the Lakers defeated the Golden State Warriors 109-101 to win consecutive games for the first time in almost a month.</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant scored 18 points, including all eight in an 8-0 run bridging the first and second quarters. Corie Blount added a season-high 17 points and a career-high 15 rebounds for the Lakers.</p>
<p>Nick Van Exel was held to eight points on 4-of-14 shooting, but handed out 14 assists for Los Angeles, which won for just the fifth time in 12 games.</p>
<p>Latrell Sprewell scored 37 points and Chris Mullin added 22 for Golden State, which has lost nine of its last 12 games and fell to 3-13 against teams in its division.</p>
<p>At Washington, Chris Webber returned to the lineup and scored all of his 32 points in the first three quarters as the Bullets routed the Vancouver Grizzlies 104-82.</p>
<p>Webber, who missed the last three games with a hip flexor, did not play in the fourth quarter as the Bullets won for the fourth time in six games.</p>
<p>Tracy Murray had 14 points and Rod Strickland added 13 as Washington placed five players in double figures.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, John Stockton scored a season-high 31 points and dished out 11 assists and Karl Malone added 27 points and 12 rebounds as the Utah Jazz cruised to their sixth straight win over the Nets, 117-102.</p>
<p>Stockton shot 10-for-14 from the field and 9-for-10 from the free-throw line.</p>
