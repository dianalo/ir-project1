<headline>Plane crash in Alabama leaves three dead.</headline>
<dateline>BIRMINGHAM, Ala. 1996-12-16</dateline>

<p>A private twin-engine plane crashed into a home in an inner-city neighbourhood shortly after takeoff Monday, killing all three people on board, emergency officials said.</p>
<p>The pilot of the Piper PA-34, struggling to keep the plane aloft with one of its engines out, put in an emergency call to air traffic controllers just before the aircraft plunged into an area of the city known as the West End.</p>
<p>Police and fire officials said the plane first clipped a tree, then the chimney of a house, before slamming into another house and catching fire. As many as nine people were said to have been in the bungalow when the plane came down at 7:20 a.m. CST but all managed to escape the single-family structure, which was gutted by the fire.</p>
<p>The Federal Aviation Administration said the plane had taken off for Pensacola, Fla., when it crashed within five miles of the Birmingham airport. George Prellezo, regional director of the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in Miami, said he could not identify the three people who died.</p>
<p>"The only thing I have so far is that the airplane was taking off from Birmingham and declared an emergency due to an engine out and crashed into a residential area. There were three fatalities and two houses damaged," he said.</p>
<p>An NTSB investigator was dispatched to the site in hopes of determining the cause of the crash.</p>
<p>"We think the plane might have been trying to land in this area," Birmingham police chief Johnnie Johnson said. "We don't know the cause."</p>
