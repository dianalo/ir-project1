<p>United States Surgical Corp said Monday it was reducing its cash tender offer to purchase common shares of Circon Corp to $14.50 per share.</p>
<p>U.S. Surgical also said it was considering a proxy contest to nominate two independent directors to Circon's board of directors to help its takeover effort.</p>
<p>"We believe this will send a clear message to Circon's management and the market that USS believes the immediate merger of these two synergistic companies is in the best interest of both companies and their respective shareholders," U.S. Surgical Chairman Leon Hirsch said.  </p>
<p>U.S. Surgical has been trying to acquire Santa Barbara, Calif.-based Circon -- which makes advanced endoscopes and miniature color video systems for medical and industrial applications -- since August 1996, when it offered $18 per share.</p>
<p>Circon's directors installed a "poison pill" and other anti-takeover measures after U.S. Surgical's first offer. Last December, U.S. Surgical reduced its offer to $17 per share.</p>
<p>U.S. Surgical said Monday it was reducing its bid yet again because of Circon's poor first-quarter 1997 performance.  </p>
<p>"This performance demonstrates that Circon's management has been unable to deliver to their shareholders the turnaround it has been promising for almost a year," U.S. Surgical said.</p>
<p>U.S. Surgical's reduced bid offer, which would bring its ownership to 14.9 percent of the outstanding Circon shares, expires on July 14.</p>
<p>After the July 14 expiration, U.S. Surgical said it then plans to begin a new tender offer to buy all outstanding common shares of Circon at $16.50 per share.  </p>
<p>"Hopefully, (Circon) management will say, 'Hey, U.S. Surgical's not going away, let's sit down and talk to them,'" U.S. Surgical spokeswoman Marianne Scipione told Reuters.</p>
<p>"But if they don't, we fully intend to... go back up to $16.50 (per share)," she said.</p>
<p>"We feel (until) we can get some directors on their board, to keep asking the right questions about why aren't you looking at this for the best interests of your shareholder, that we're not going to get any movement. We'd love this to be a friendly merger, and we feel that every step we take toward that, is showing them that we're not going away."  </p>
<p>Scipione said the two companies were synergistic because Circon has a strong presence in urology products, while U.S. Surgical has vast overseas presence.</p>
<p>She said about half of U.S. Surgical's annual $1.1 billion in sales come from Europe and Asia, while only 16-18 percent of Circon's are overseas.</p>
<p>"We think we could give them a tremendous value-added exposure in the rest of the world," she said.</p>
<p>"I've been surprised all along that Circon has fought the takeover as hard as they have," said Eva Snitkin, analyst at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.  </p>
<p>"In retrospect, that first offer (of $18) now looks pretty sweet," Snitkin said. "It seems to continually get worse at Circon, yet they have a very good franchise in urology."</p>
<p>"U.S. Surgical is saying, 'We're going to value you at what you're worth, not according to your imagination."</p>
<p>"Circon is not performing, but it still makes sense within U.S. Surgical."</p>
<p>At 1222 EDT, U.S. Surgical stock was up 1/8 to 33-7/8 on volume of 575,400 shares.</p>
