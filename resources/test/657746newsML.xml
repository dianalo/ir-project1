<p>Dutch supermarkets group Ahold NV reported a 69 percent increase in 1997 first quarter net profit to 234.4 million guilders ($121 million).</p>
<p>It repeated its forecast it expected 1997 earnings to be considerably higher than those of 1997.  </p>
<p>Ahold said the sharp rise in net earnings was mainly attributable to last year's acquisition of U.S. supermarket chain Stop &amp; Shop.</p>
<p>The stronger dollar -- worth an average 1.87 guilders in the first quarter of 1997 compared with 1.65 guilders in the same period of 1996 -- also had a positive impact.</p>
<p>Exchange rate movements, mainly in the dollar-guilder rate, added some 15.2 million guilders to net earnings or 0.09 guilders to earnings per share.</p>
<p>First quarter sales rose 48 percent to 14.0 billion guilders. Ahold said the increase in first quarter sales would have been only 17 percent if Stop &amp; Shop had also been included in consolidated sales figures for the first quarter of 1996.</p>
