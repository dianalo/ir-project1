<p>THE DOMINION</p>
<p>A security guard usually stationed outside Trust Bank's Naenae branch was not working when a bank teller, described as a "gentle giant", was slain during a bungled robbery on Wednesday, witnesses said. William Brown, married with two daughters, was apparently shot in the back of the head while making a telephone call from the Everest Ave bank about 10.20 a.m. Brown's wife, Nadia, said on Wednesday night that his mother used to call her 1.85-metre (6ft 1in) son "her gentle giant" because he was such a kind man. Police on Wednedsay identified only one offender but a witness said three men were involved. Page 1.  </p>

However, on Wednesday Fitzsimons said her concerns were addressed at Tuesday's Alliance caucus meeting. She had also spoken to Alliance leader Jim Anderton, who had taken her concerns seriously.

<p>said. Page 2.</p>

<p>Associate Health Minister Neil Kirton wants special teams to assess the health of children in "at risk" communities when they start school. The NZ First MP said on Wednesday that providing free health care for children under five, as promised in his party's coalition agreement with National, was a step in the right direction. But that might not be enough to improve the health of all children. In some cases parents did not take their child to the doctor until it was too late. Page 2.</p>

<p>The New Zealand dollar fell to its lowest level in five and a half months against the United States dollar on Wednesday, bringing some hope to struggling exporters. The Kiwi dollar was down a third of a cent to just under US 69 cents on Wednesday. Manufacturers Federation spokesman Gilbert Peterson said the fall from about US71c earlier this month to US68.8c on Wednesday would make a big difference to the confidence of exporters. Page 12.</p>

<p>United States-based investment bank Goldman Sachs and Co said on Wednesday the rapid rise of the New Zealand dollar that began last year "may be over". "After being wrong in 1996 about an early reversal of Kiwi over-valuation, we are cautiously adopting a negative stance toward the currency," Goldman Sachs says in its weekly analyst report. "There is certainly nothing attractive about the Kiwi." Page 12</p>

<p>More rationalisation will be needed in electricity retailing before power companies can significantly lift their financial performance, a study of returns by Ernst and Young says. Electric power companies have improved their efficiency, cutting  </p>
<p>average line charges a unit of electricity delivered by three percent between March 1995 and March 1996, the study says. But while efficiency gains caused direct and indirect cost measures to fall by 11 percent and 18 percent respectively, the opportunity for dramatic cost savings still exists in a number of large companies, the study says.

<p>Nardia Brown bought a special watch at Sydney airport last month for husband Bill's 50th birthday this November. On Wednesday night, stunned and shaken as she was trying to come to terms with his horrific death in a Lower Hutt bank robbery, she wondered what had made her insist that he wore it immediately. "It's as though I knew. It was a fantastic watch and I wanted to see it on him so I said, 'Wear it now. Don't wait'. I'm glad now he did because now he never will ... ever." The quiet, unassuming bank teller, father of two adult daughters, was shot in the head during the holdup of Naenae branch of Trust Bank.  </p>

<p>An estimate by United States invetment bank Goldman Sachs that the New Zealand dollar is 15 percent overvalued had little impact on the kiwi yesterday. It fell 32 points to a six-month low of 68.68 US cents but a lack of buyers, rather than keen  </p>
<p>selling, was the reason. But dealers remained wary of more selling of the kiwi overnight in the United States. "They've been quite keen sellers in the last few days and the Goldman report might see that continue," said one.</p>
