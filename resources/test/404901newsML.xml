<p>A 12 percent rise in freight rates announced in India's annual railway budget on Wednesday is likely to increase production costs and fuel inflation, leading industry organisations said.</p>
<p>Presenting the railway budget for 1997/98 in parliament, Railways Minister Ram Vilas Paswan said he planned to raise freight rates for all commodities, barring essentials, by 12 percent. The increases would apply to all distances.</p>
<p>"The increase in freight rates will have a cascading effect," said A.S. Kasliwal, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICC).</p>
<p>"Going by past experience, there is a possibility of the increased freight rate pushing inflation by two to three percentage points which will undoubtedly affect business morale," Kasliwal said.</p>
<p>The Associated Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (Assocham) said the "hefty hike" would increase production costs and fuel inflation.</p>
<p>Assocham President H.L Somany said in a statement that increased costs could have been met in other ways.</p>
<p>"The major part of the resources could have been internally generated by cutting down working expenses through increased operational efficiency and elimination of non-essential expenditure," Somany said.</p>
<p>Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) president Shekhar Datta said the freight hike was an unfortunate step, especially when industrial growth was showing signs of a slowdown.</p>
<p>He said instead of generating resources through increases in passenger fares and freight hikes, the railways must concentrate on increasing efficiency.</p>
<p>"It is alarming that from carrying 89 percent of the country's total freight traffic in 1950-51, the railways' share has dropped to 42 percent today," Datta said in a statement.</p>
