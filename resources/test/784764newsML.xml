<p>Leaders of Argentina's CGT trade union federation ratified their support for the Peronist administration ahead of October midterm polls, in which the ruling party faces a strong new opposition alliance.</p>
<p>"We think Peronism is the only option for the country and for workers," the leader of the CGT-affiliated UOCRA construction workers union, Gerardo Martinez, told a gathering of 90 member unions Wednesday, in comments reported Thursday.  </p>
<p>Martinez, who is running for Congress on the Peronist slate in Buenos Aires province, was speaking three days after Argentina's main opposition parties announced an electoral alliance that analysts say could sway the outcome of the vote.</p>
<p>The CGT also defended a tentative agreement on labor law reforms in May with President Carlos Menem's government, reached after months of disagreement and three general strikes in less than a year.</p>
<p>"The victory of the Peronists on October 26 is the only way to guarantee that workers will be protagonists," Martinez said in a speech.  </p>
<p>Martinez and CGT chief Rodolfo Daer both forecast the Peronists would win the polls, although Daer said the CGT would not officially reject the opposition alliance "because we are a pluralist organization."</p>
<p>Daer said he personally saw the alliance as "part of the political game that exists in demoracies."</p>
<p>"The proposals it launches will help enrich us all and force the government and Peronist Party to think harder to offer the people better alternatives," the CGT leader told reporters at the same rally.</p>
<p>"We are waiting to see how the alliance tackles the issue of distribution of wealth, a great task that remains to be done in our country."</p>
<p>The CGT is opposing a general strike called for August 14 by dissident trade unions unhappy with the labor reform deal and with general economic policy.</p>
