<p>Belgian hurdler Jonathan Nsenga has been suspended for three months after testing positive for the banned stimulant ephedrine at this month's world indoor athletics championships in Paris, the Belgian athletics federation said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman said that Nsenga, who finished sixth in the 60 metres hurdles final, would not ask for a second test as that would only delay the suspension.</p>
<p>She said Nsenga had been careless by taking Chinese herbs which contained ephedrine.</p>
<p>"There are extenuating circumstances...It was not indicated that the herbs contained ephedrine," she said.</p>
<p>The Belgian union itself had asked for Nsenga to be tested after he broke the national 60 metres hurdles record twice in Paris.</p>
