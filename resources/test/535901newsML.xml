<title>USA: Gulf Breeze, Florida plans inflation-indexed bonds.</title>
<headline>Gulf Breeze, Florida plans inflation-indexed bonds.</headline>

<p>The City of Gulf Breeze, Florida, wants to sell on Tuesday up to $160 million of revenue bonds pegged to the Consumer Price Index, underwriter Raymond James  said on Thursday.</p>
<p>This would only be the second such offering the muni market has seen. However, at present it appears the bond sale likely will be smaller than the full amount that could be issued.  </p>
<p>Peter Delahunt, New York City-based national sales manager for the municipal bond department at Raymond James, said: "Right now, it looks like demand lies somewhere around $100 million."</p>
<p>Insurance companies and nuclear decommissioning funds are displaying the biggest appetite for the new Gulf Breeze issue, which also is expected to draw retail demand, Delahunt said.</p>
<p>The bonds, which will have maturities as long as 20 years, were expected to be priced at about 155 basis points over the six months change in the Consumer Price Index. This would be richer than the first inflation-indexed municipal bonds, a recent $40 million sale by the City of Orlando, Florida.</p>
<p>That offering, which Goldman Sachs underwrote, had 10-year maturities, and was priced at 125 basis points over the six months change in the inflation index. Goldman Sachs now is trying to sell inflation-indexed bonds, which are widely used by governmental entities and corporations, to California localities. "I think we have a clear indication of interest in a chunk of California tax-exempt Consumper Price Index floaters," said Aaron Gurwitz, who heads the firm's municipal capital markets group.</p>
