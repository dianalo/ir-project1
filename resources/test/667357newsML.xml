<p>Two of the U.S. tobacco industry's largest cigarette makers were ready to accept a broad regulatory power over nicotine but backed off at the urgings of B.A.T Industries Plc Chief Executive Martin Broughton, the Wall Street Journal said.</p>
<p>In Tuesday's electronic edition, the Journal said Broughton told his counterparts at Philip Morris Cos Inc and RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp they were giving up too much in settlement talks.  </p>
<p>In particular, he urged the two companies not to back off their push to receive immunity from punitive damages. The Journal said those two companies were ready to present a settlement package to the White House that left unresolved the issue of punitive damages.</p>
<p>Unnamed sources told the Journal that industry negotiators had expected that Broughton, in meetings Friday with other executives, would merely say his piece and then fall into line.</p>
<p>Instead, during the seven-hour meeting, Broughton apparently stiffened the resolve of his U.S. counterparts, helping to convince Philip Morris and RJR not to give in on the punitive-damages issue, unnamed negotiators said.</p>
