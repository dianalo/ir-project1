<p>The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) began to offload crude oil tankers on Friday evening after Hurricane Danny passed through and is only slightly backed up as a result of the storm which shut down loading late last week, a spokesperson said on Monday.</p>
<p>"We started off-loading on Friday evening. The arrival of that particular ship and others was delayed because of the storm but the backlog is nothing serious," said the LOOP official.</p>
<p>There was another ship offloading on Sunday and there are two more at anchorage, he said.</p>
<p>Hurricane Danny passed through the Gulf of Mexico at the end of last week and shut in some oil and gas production, caused two refineries to close temporarily for safety and delayed shipping.</p>
<p>The damage caused to oil installations by the storm, however, appeared to be minimal and workers were returning to platforms on Friday and Saturday, with production expected back on by Sunday, in most cases.</p>
