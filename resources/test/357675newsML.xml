<p>Bangladesh's taka has been readjusted downward against the U.S. dollar to 42.65/85 from 42.35/55 effective on Saturday, a Bangladesh Bank (central bank) circular said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The central bank gave no explanation on its move but officials with commercial banks said the downwards adjustment of the taka was aimed at boosting the country's exports.</p>
<p>The taka was last adjusted downwards on September 23.  </p>
<p>Finance Minister S.A.M.S. Kibria on Tuesday said the taka was strong and ruled out any major devaluation in the near future. Bangladesh's garment exporters have been demanding devaluation of the taka to remain competitive in international apparel market.</p>
<p>Following is the rate of Bangladesh taka against U.S. dollar:</p>
<p>    Present	   Previous	 Year ago</p>
<p>    42.65/85	  42.35/55	 40.90/41.10</p>
