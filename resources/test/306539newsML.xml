<p>Shares in Belgian chemicals firm Tessenderlo jumped almost six percent on Tuesday as its high liquidity, recent acquisitions and interest in industrial stocks was attracting investors to the share.</p>
<p>"In a positive stock market it is normal that a stock like Tessenderlo is outperforming with its fundamentals in order," analyst Luc Van Der Elst at G-Securities told Reuters.</p>
<p>Analysts said investors were seeking industrial stocks, particularly chemical and pharmaceutical stocks as 1997 fundamentals were positive.  </p>
<p>"Chemicals have done well in 1996 compared to other cyclicals, like steel shares," Van Der Elst said.</p>
<p>At 1210 GMT Tessenderlo was up 5.6 percent at 15,500 francs after earlier touching a high of 15,700 -- up 5.9 percent.</p>
<p>"It's been picking up companies recently, and has more liquidity which is reducing the cyclicality of the stock," Van Der Elst said.</p>
<p>Tessenderlo recently announced plans to buy French eperef SA and the acquisition of U.S. Chelsea Building Products, but maintains a low level of debt.</p>
<p>G-Securities said it was too early to sell the stock.</p>
