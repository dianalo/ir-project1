<p>Martin Broughton, chief executive of B.A.T Industries, said the company was seeking to build up its presence in the independent financial advice (IFA) segment of the financial services industry.</p>
<p>The IFA channel accounts for half of all UK life insurance and pensions but B.A.T, which owns Allied Dunbar and Eagle Star in Britain, has a relatively small share of that business.</p>
<p>"We would seek to build up our position at the IFA level and if an appropriate brand was found to fit that profile we would be interested," Broughton told a meeting of analysts.</p>
<p>However, the cost of buying a building society, the main providers of loans to new home buyers in Britain, was still too high "We continue to see how we can add value to building societies and the price necessary to buy one is too great given the overcapacity in the industry and pretty low margins."</p>
<p>B.A.T has been tipped in press reports as a potential predator for the Woolwich Building Society.</p>
<p>B.A.T's gearing, currently around the 40 percent level, leaves it plenty of headroom for acquisitions. It allowed its gearing to run up to 80 percent at the time of its $5.2 billion acquisition of U.S. insurer Farmer in 1988.</p>
