<title>USA: Gasoline prices rise as overseas demand gathers pace.</title>
<headline>Gasoline prices rise as overseas demand gathers pace.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-08</dateline>

<p>Gasoline prices ended higher on Tuesday, supported by demand abroad and by a periodic scheduling deadline at a pipeline terminal in Houston.</p>
<p>In other markets, heating oil was lower, soybeans slipped from eight year highs and palladium set a four-week high.</p>
<p>Analysts said shortages of gasoline in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia helped boost the gasoline market.</p>
<p>Nigeria, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, has been suffering from a two-week-old gasoline shortage.</p>
<p>An official of the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation said earlier this week the military government had approved gasoline imports, the first since September.</p>
<p>Fuel shortages occur frequently in Nigeria and usually last a few days but the current crisis shows no sign of easing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, traders said Saudi Arabia is looking to buy 300,000 barrels of gasoline for delivery in early May.</p>
<p>Also supporting prices was buying by shippers trying to line up supplies to meet a deadline to schedule shipments of gasoline through the Colonial Pipeline from Houston to the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>Gasoline for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled up 0.45 cent a gallon at 61.17 cents. May heating oil ended off 0.23 cent a gallon at 52.89 cents while May crude finished up 12 cents a barrel at $19.35.</p>
<p>Soybeans on the Chicago Board of Trade closed sharply lower, hit by ideas that a report due to be issued Friday by the U.S. Department of Agriculture may show projected supplies have not dropped as much as previously thought.</p>
<p>"There seemed to be a little bit of growing disenchantment that the USDA was going to make a significant change on the supply/demand report," said Dale Durchholz, analyst with Agrivisor Services, a division of the Illinois Farm Bureau.</p>
<p>USDA in March put stocks at the end of the current marketing year on August 31 at 140 million bushels, a level considered tight.</p>
<p>Soybeans had rallied to an eight year high last week on ideas the stocks number would fall even further in the next report. USDA's 22 million bushel downward revision in the March 1 quarterly stocks supported that idea.</p>
<p>Further pressing the price were reports that South America was stepping up to fill the shortage.</p>
<p>Taiwan early Tuesday bought 54,000 tonnes of South American soybeans and South Korea bought 85,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybean meal.</p>
<p>"Brazil has shown that they're going to be a formidable exporter of beans and meal," Durchholz said. "There's good potential that they can put a pretty serious dent into demand for U.S. soybeans this spring and into summer."</p>
<p>Weather was also deemed bearish. Forecasts called for cold, wet weather in the U.S. Midwest next week which could delay corn plantings and force farmers to plant faster growing soybeans.</p>
<p>Soybeans for May delivery closed 13-1/2 cents lower at $8.49-1/4, well below last week's peak of $8.88-1/2.</p>
<p>At the New York Mercantile Exchange palladium for June delivery rose to a four week high of $157.50 before closing $1.35 higher at $153.75.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Russian officials said there would be no exports of Russian palladium to Japan in April and possibly none in May, while overall 1997 exports would be much lower.</p>
<p>Russia supplies about 60 percent of the world's palladium while Japan consumes about 40 percent of the metal in automotive and electronic applications.</p>
