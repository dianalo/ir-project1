<p>Shares in South African furniture retailer, Protea Furnishers Ltd, rose to their best level this year as the market responded positively to news it had bought back its debtors book from First National Bank (FNB).</p>
<p>At the same time FNB stocks on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) also edged higher in busy dealings on perceptions the deal would ease its problems with bad debts.</p>
<p>"The deal has put a positive view on Profurn. They know better how to trade their book than FNB does. It's also going to help FNB which has had a lot of troubles with debts," a dealer on the JSE said.</p>
<p>Profurn shares touched a morning best of 142 cents in busy trade, beating an previous high of 140. By 1100 GMT shares settled five cents up at 140 in volume of 1.38 million shares.</p>
<p>Shares in FNB were up 25 cents at 32 rand, just short of a year high of 32.50 rand, after a hefty 4.3 million shares had traded.</p>
<p>Profurn on Monday announced it had repurchased its furniture financing business, including the debtors' book and staff, from FNB for about 270 million rand.</p>
<p>The transaction, which sees FNB becoming Profurn's largest shareholder with a 22 percent stake, was effective April 1, 1997.</p>
<p>Profurn financial director Gavin Walker said the deal had financial benefits for the group.</p>
<p>"The benefits from the preferred interest and the profits from the book more than offset the dilutionary effect from the issuing of new shares (used to pay for the purchase) and we believe will in fact enhance earnings per share," he said.</p>
