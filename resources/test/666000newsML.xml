<headline>UK natgas slips, dominated by urgent storage modification.</headline>

<p>UK natural gas prices dipped slightly on Tuesday but the market's main focus was the urgent Network Code modification proposal put out by Enron and requesting that Transco's imminent sale tender be done in tranches rather than all on July 1, and be done at the NBP as well as just at Rough and Partington storages.</p>
<p>Market reaction was mixed.</p>
<p>One player pointed out that the modification became known relatively late in the day, too late to have an impact on the market immediately. But he said that with gas only available at Rough, it could be carried through to next winter. By contrast, if it is available at the NBP, "everyone will have to re-evaluate their positions. It could be bearish on Q3."</p>
<p>But this player agreed with another who said that it was likely to have a bullish impact on July, as the modification would delay the first availabilities of gas whether at Rough or the NBP, so keeping the market shorter than had been expected.</p>
<p>Another expressed dismay, having purchased capacity at Easington for a total of around a penny a therm, including capacity and exit charges for removing gas from storage, in order to make storage space available to inject the tender gas.</p>
<p>And he added that, having already withdrawn some gas from Rough, he had now been told by Transco that he could not reinject it.</p>
<p>"I've picked up a lot of opposing viewpoints," he said. "I think this may be an urgent mod that won't go through. I'm not necessarily opposed," he added, "but it's just a complete U-turn."</p>
<p>On the market itself, a relatively large volume of within day and day ahead gas was traded, with one buyer on the within day market saying that one producer was actively selling.</p>
<p>Further forward prices slipped slightly in most periods, although traded volumes were not particularly heavy. And there was an above-average number of spreads done for a number of different periods.</p>
<p>The IPE futures market kicked into life again after a couple of quiet days, with 190 lots traded at mostly lower prices in eight different months.</p>
