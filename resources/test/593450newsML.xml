<p>Hong Kong prepared for the arrival on Monday of a new wave of Chinese soldiers to guard it after the handover, against a backdrop of curbs on civil liberties and closer links with its new ruler, Beijing.</p>
<p>With only 44 days to go until Hong Kong reverts to Chinese sovereignty, the pace of change is being stepped up as links with the mainland supersede those with Britain.</p>
<p>Hong Kong returns to Chinese sovereignty on July 1 after more than 150 years of British rule, and physical and symbolic links are being strengthened ahead of the event.</p>
<p>A second batch of 66 People's Liberation Army troops is due to arrive in Hong Kong on Monday, the same day a train from Beijing will arrive in Hong Kong to mark the launch of a new direct rail service between Hong Kong and Beijing.</p>
<p>The first group of 40 PLA troops arrived in Hong Kong in April, and another 90 are due to arrive on May 30.</p>
<p>Throughout the colony signs of British rule are fast disappearing. Crowns, the symbol of British sovereignty, are being pried from postboxes, which will be painted green, similar in hue to China's, after the handover.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's present guardians, the British army, on Friday packed up a radio station which had provided a life-line for homesick British soldiers stationed in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Hong Kong police last week staged a joint exercise with their mainland counterparts to stem smuggling of people into the territory from China. A possible flood of illegal immigrants into the territory after the handover is among Hong Kong's residents' top concerns.</p>
<p>Other changes in the territory are far more controversial.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the China-backed provisional legislature passed first and second readings of bills banning foreign political groups from donating money to local political parties and allowing some demonstrations to be barred on the grounds of "national security".</p>
<p>Beijing, angered by democratic reforms enacted by Britain, set up the provisional legislature in December to replace the currently elected Legislative Council after July 1.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's future government wants the bill to be passed in its final reading before midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>Though Tung diluted his original plan to amend civil liberties laws following widespread criticism, the amended proposal continues to draw flak in Hong Kong and the United States.</p>
<p>"The United States has believed very strongly that the existing ordinances adequately protect human and political rights in Hong Kong," U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said on Friday.</p>
<p>Outgoing governor Chris Patten has argued that there was no need to change the laws, and Hong Kong's popular Democratic Party has said it would launch a legal challenge in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>But Singapore Senior Minister Lee Kuan-Yew said on Friday that chief executive-designate Tung would lose China's trust if he maintained democratic reforms introduced by Patten.</p>
<p>Lee said Patten's political agenda had provided a stick with which foreign lobby groups could beat China.</p>
