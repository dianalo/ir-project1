<p>French car parts maker Valeo plans a three billion franc ($530.2 million) restructuring of its European operations that would involve closing some plants and expanding others, chairman Noel Goutard said in a French magazine interview.</p>
<p>"We've observed that we need to look again at our industrial operations in western Europe. We have too many medium-sized plants," Goutard told the weekly L'Expansion.</p>
<p>"In order to obtain economies of scale and structural benefits...we've decided to reduce the number of establishments and expand the plants that we'll keep," he said.</p>
<p>A company spokesman declined to give a figure on closures.</p>
<p>"We're rebuilding the facilities in Reims, Sens, Laval, Nogent and La Suze," Goutard said. He said the group planned to invest three billion francs over two years on the restructuring.</p>
<p>"This restructuring will not translate into lower staff levels overall," he said. "On the other hand, a company doesn't exist to be inert or to be the battleground for a class struggle."</p>
<p>In an interview with the Financial Times, Goutard said Valeo intended to strengthen its presence in Britain. He said Valeo would probably have shifted more jobs out of France and Germany if the dollar had not strengthened against the franc and mark.</p>
<p>Valeo, which is scheduled to report its 1996 results shortly after 1600 GMT on Tuesday, is sticking to its sales target of 40 billion francs by the year 2000, Goutard said. He said he aimed to generate half the group's sales outside Europe within five years, up from 30 percent currently.</p>
<p>Valeo's 1996 sales were 28.9 billion francs, up 14 percent.</p>
<p>It operates 70 plants in Europe.</p>
