<p>QUESTION OF THE WEEK - Following the recent softness in capital good imports, and the importance of the business investment forecast to the growth forecast, economists were asked for their forecast of 1996/97 total business investment.  </p>
<p>The government forecast in the budget was for a 14 percent rise in total business investment -- which consists of plant and equipment and non-dwelling construction spending.</p>
<p>Market economists tended to come in below that forecast, although they did say the Treasury had a good track record on business investment in recent years.</p>
<p>Of the 31 economists surveyed, only three forecast a figure stronger than the government, while another three expected the government's forecast to be met.</p>
<p>Those at the weaker end of forecasts tended to have weaker GDP growth forecasts than the government's 3.5 percent.  </p>
<p>This fit in within recently retired Reserve Bank Govenor Bernie Fraser's statement in Tokyo earlier this month that "the main key to achieving the 3.5 percent GDP growth forecast for 1996/97 is business investment."</p>
<p>Some eocnomists said the government forecast may have erred on the upside, as the business investment forecast could effect sentiment. A weak forecast could have undermined some confidence by creating the belief that the budget would be contractionary, economists said.</p>

<p>JOB VACANCIES AND OVERTIME - Not a widely forecast series, but potentially the most interesting release of the week. Those who did forecast it were expecting a fall of up to 10 percent, with most expecting a figure around a five percent fall, in line with the weakness seen in the ANZ job advertisement series in the May to August period. Given the focus on the labour market in the the interest rate debate, economists said the figures may fuel rate cut expectations in the market, even though a rate cut in reponse to a sluggish labour market was delivered in July.  </p>
<p>MOTOR REGISTRATIONS - After the volatility of recent months -- up 18.5 percent, down 17.7 percent -- economists expect a small rise and an eventual return to the slow uptrend that was being seen earlier this year. Industry data suggests a rise, but further wild figures would see the value of the series to the market devalued, economists said.</p>
