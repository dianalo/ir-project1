<p>Key Spanish firms Telefonica de Espana and electricity giant Iberdrola have agreed a joint venture to develop value-added services, a press statement from the two firms said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The deal foresees the joint development of cable television activities.</p>
<p>It also contemplates collaboration on unspecified activities in Latin America.</p>
<p>The joint venture will operate within the engineering and value-added services design areas, the statement said. Iberdrola will also become part of the Telyco/Telespacio unit's capital, the statement said.</p>
<p>No valuation for the unit was given.</p>
<p>The deal allows Iberdrola's entry into Telefonica units Cabitel and telemarketing unit Estratel, and the firms will set out retailing and marketing strategies.</p>
<p>The deal was contemplated in a strategic telecoms agreement between the two firms in January 1996.</p>
