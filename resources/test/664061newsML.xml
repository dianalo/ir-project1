<p>HSBC James Capel said on Monday it raised its rating on the shares of PacifiCorp to a long-term buy from neutral, based on the company's proposed acquisition of Britain's Energy Group Plc.</p>
<p>-- PacifiCorp agreed on Friday to buy Energy Group for $9.6 billion in a deal that would create one of the world's biggest energy companies.  </p>
<p>-- Analyst Daniel Ford said in a research note the acquisition would be 20 percent accretive to earnings in both 1998 and 1999 under the reasonable financing options.</p>
<p>-- Ford said an acquisition would combine two highly competitive electricity generators that seemed to have common visions for exploiting opportunities in global energy markets.</p>
<p>-- His 18-month valuation suggested a $25 per share price target, Ford said.</p>
