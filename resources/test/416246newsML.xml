<p>The won edged higher against the dollar by the end of Monday's trading on export negotiations and the dollar's weak trend against the Japanese yen, traders said.</p>
<p>The imminent naming of a new prime minister and the announcement of the February trade deficit figures had no impact on the market, they added.</p>
<p>"Everyone was expecting a wider deficit so it wasn't a surprise," said a Deutsche Bank dealer.</p>
<p>The won ended at 863.40, compared to an opening of 863.50. It moved in a range of 862.90-864.20. Last Friday, the local unit closed at 864.20.  </p>
<p>"Though the dollar edged up against the yen in late trading, the overall trend has been weak," said the Deutsche dealer. "This is making the market reluctant to buy dollars."</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the won fell against the dollar due to import settlements. Traders said import and export settlements later balanced each other out. The won is expected to move in a narrow 863-864 range on Tuesday.</p>
<p>President Kim Young-sam has launched a sweeping reshuffle of his administration after a scandal involving loans to failed Hanbo Steel Co. The trade deficit widened to $2.1 billion in February from a $1.6 billion shortfall a year ago.</p>
