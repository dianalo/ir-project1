<headline>Analysts' comments on KLM -Northwest deal.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1997-07-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines  said on Wednesday it was selling its 19 percent stake in U.S. partner Northwest in exchange for long term operational and commercial contracts of 10 years' minimum.</p>
<p>Below is a collection of analysts' comments on the sell-off:</p>
<p>FRITS DE VRIES, GILISSEN BANKIERS:</p>
<p>"In itself it's a positive move...KLM has now made it very clear they want to go ahead with Northwest. The most important thing now is to pick up a European partner to boost their market share to the targeted 15 percent (from some eight percent now)."</p>
<p>"The most likely candidate is Alitalia, they're really the only ones left, although Swissair is a possibility -- but they would have to hive off their alliance with (U.S. carrier) Delta Airlines first."</p>
<p>"Northwest clearly prefers Alitalia...it has a strong position in its domestic market, is centrally located in Europe and a strong hold in Latin America where Northwest doesn't."</p>
<p>"In terms of deepening the KLM-Northwest alliance, a key factor is to expand freight cooperation...KLM could market Northwest's freight in Europe and vice versa -- Northwest could take over KLM's freight marketing in Asia and North America."</p>
<p>PAUL DE GRAAFF, SENIOR EXECUTIVE EQUITY SALES, MEESPIERSON</p>
<p>"Strengthening the operating alliance with a 10-year contract is a positive step forward...the dispute between the two has hung like a sword of Damocles over the alliance.</p>
<p>"The deal makes an alliance with Alitalia less unlikely, there's no-one left in Europe now. A strong deal with Northwest rules out a partnership with British Airways...because of its American Airlines link. U.S. links were always a stumbling block to British Airways and KLM getting together.</p>
<p>"Alitalia has problems...I guess it will have to come with a dowry."  </p>
<p>GERT JOCHEMS, NIB SECURITIES:</p>
<p>"The sentiment within the alliance has improved now. The shareholding was a block that had to be removed. The road to the future is open, but you need someone to drive the car... I am waiting for some real action.... From a global perspective, an alliance alone with a U.S. partner is not enough... so it's clear that KLM lacks a strong and consistent Asian partner and a European partner. During the years of quarrelling (with Northwest), KLM has lost ground. The problem is that there are not many European partners left, certainly ones of a high quality..."</p>
<p>"With the extra money, at least KLM's balance sheet will be stronger than ever... What I can imagine is that KLM and Alitalia are in discussions, possibly about the stake in (Hungarian air carrier) Malev which Alitalia must sell. Swissair would be the surprise scenario. They are having problems with their alliance with Delta and there are some points already visible, as Swissair is segregating its leisure side. Of course this is all hypothetical."</p>
<p>"I'm a bit surprised by the market reaction. It was already rumoured before."</p>
