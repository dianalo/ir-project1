<p>Russian trade union leaders promised on Tuesday not to demand the resignation of the reshuffled government during their planned nationwide protest on March 27, Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>
<p>Tass quoted Labour Minister Alexander Melikyan as saying the promise was made during talks between the union leaders and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>Union leaders could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>Trade unions called the protest action to demand urgent measures to end chronic delays in wages and pension, which are stoking social tension.</p>
<p>On Monday Yeltsin signed a decree dramatically reshaping the government and putting some reformist ministers in top cabinet positions.</p>
