<p>Former prime minister Mesut Yilmaz was re-elected as leader of Turkey's main opposition Motherland Party (ANAP) on Saturday, Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>Yilmaz received 1,032 votes from the delegates at a scheduled party congress, beating challenger Isin Celebi, a former state minister in charge of economy, with 170 votes.</p>
<p>Yilmaz, leader of ANAP for the past four years and twice prime minister, said he would bring change to the conservative party's policies during his new one-year term.</p>
<p>"The future of our party means the future of Turkey," Yilmaz was quoted by the agency as telling a cheerful crowd gathered at a gymnasium in suburban Ankara.</p>
<p>"We will realise a change -- a change that will make Turkey look brighter," he said.</p>
<p>Yilmaz last became prime minister in February when ANAP, established in 1983 by late President Turgut Ozal, joined with Tansu Ciller's True Path Party (DYP) to form a minority coalition until it collapsed in June due to internal rifts.</p>
<p>The DYP then formed a coalition with the Islamist Welfare Party led by the current Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan in late June.</p>
