<p>Germany's coalition government and opposition were due on Monday to begin three days of last-ditch talks to seek a compromise on plans to cut taxes to boost investment and jobs.</p>
<p>Negotiators from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling alliance and the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) were to meet in parliament's conflict resolution process after the SPD voted down government tax reforms in the Bundesrat upper house.</p>
<p>Failure to agree on tax cuts could condemn Germany to being relegated to what Hans-Olaf Henkel of the Federation of German Industry (BDI) called at the weekend "the second division" of world economic powers.</p>
<p>But the chances of reaching a broad deal looked remote in an atmosphere of political backbiting which has been stoked by the looming prospect of general elections next year.</p>
<p>In the runup up to the talks, some coalition leaders said they would rather drop Finance Minister Theo Waigel's plan to cut 30 billion marks in taxes completely than see it watered down.</p>
<p>"We should let the whole tax reform fail rather than agree a shabby compromise," Wolfgang Gerhardt, leader of coalition partners the Free Democrats (FDP), told the Welt am Sonntag.</p>
<p>But coalition politicians closer to Kohl appeared more ready to seek a halfway house with the SPD, saying that a net tax cut of 15 billion marks would still be acceptable.</p>
<p>"Everyone knows we won't get a tax reform without net tax cuts. Without net cuts we won't get more growth through investment and consumption," Christian Democrat (CDU) tax expert Hans-Peter Repnik told German Radio on Monday.</p>
<p>Waigel's tax plans envisage slashing the main corporation tax rate to 35 percent from 47 percent by 1999, and cutting top-rate personal income tax to 39 percent from 53 percent.</p>
<p>Offsetting the cuts would be the abolition of over 70 tax breaks seen as hindering investment and forcing up unemployment which, at over four million, is approaching post-war highs.</p>
<p>The SPD, while agreeing with the coalition on a few points, says that an urgent cut in Germany's burdensome non-wage labour costs is far more important than net tax reductions.</p>
<p>Finance spokeswoman Ingrid Matthaeus-Maier, also speaking on German Radio, said her party wanted a one-point cut in both pensions and unemployment insurance charges from October 1.</p>
<p>Coalition sources confirmed a report in the Spiegel news weekly suggesting the government was prepared to raise petrol tax by 10 pfennigs a litre and increase value-added tax by one percentage point to pay for the cut in non-wage costs.</p>
<p>Indirect tax hikes would also leave room to meet FDP demands to cut the solidarity tax -- an income tax surcharge raised to finance the rebuilding of eastern Germany -- by two points next year.</p>
<p>The two sides were to meet in working groups on Monday and Tuesday before the mediation committee of the two houses of parliament holds a formal session on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Although there was little prospect of a breakthrough on the overall tax reform, both Repnik and Matthaeus-Maier said there were hopes a deal could be struck to end a two-year row over scrapping a corporate capital trading tax.</p>
