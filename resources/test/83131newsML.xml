<p>U.S. House and Senate lawmakers agreed Saturday to include a $220 million sale of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help close the budget gap for fiscal 1997, a House aide said Saturday.</p>
<p>The provision was put into a catch-all spending bill which Congress plans to send to the president Monday night.</p>
<p>The measure requires the administration to draw down $220 million worth of oil between Oct 1, 1996 and Sept 30, 1997.</p>
<p>The oil sale was agreed to despite the House's rejection of a similar provision last month.</p>
<p>This will be the third sale of SPR oil ever purely intended to raise revenue.</p>
<p>Many lawmakers see the action as a waste of the nation's emergency oil stockpile.</p>
