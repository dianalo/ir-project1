<p>Britain's newest terrestrial television station Channel 5 is likely to win more of its audience from Channel 4 and BBC2 than from the mainstream BBC1 and ITV channels, a report released on Tuesday said.</p>
<p>"Channel 4 and BBC2 will lose disproportionately, and may permanently come off worse than ITV or BBC1," Zenith Media, the media-buying and planning arm of Cordiant Plc, said in its preview of Britain's spring television programme.</p>
<p>Channel 5, the first commercial terrestrial station to launch since Channel 4 began broadcasting in 1982, was launched on Sunday. Initial figures from the BARB monitoring service gave Channel 5 a 5.8 percent share of viewing in the 6 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. slot on Sunday, beating Channel 4's share of 4.7 percent.</p>
<p>Zenith, whose programme preview was written ahead of the Channel 5 debut, said it will be weeks or months befor e the new station's success or failure can be judged.</p>
<p>Channel 5 is owned by British media companies Pearson Plc and United News &amp; Media Plc, as well as European broadcast group CLT-Ufa and U.S. private investment firm Warburg Pincus.</p>
<p>It aims for an audience somewhere between ITV's mass market and Channel 4's youth audience.</p>
<p>Zenith, meanwhile, sharply criticised ITV, saying it "...has slept through the alarm clocks of a revitalised BBC and a seriously commercial (Channel) 4."</p>
<p>ITV's responses to competition "...have been mechanical rather than inspired", Zenith said. It noted that ITV has been experiencing a falling share of the viewing audience, down to almost 34 percent in the first seven weeks of 1997 from 37 percent a year-earlier and 35 percent for all of 1996.</p>
