<p>Striker Elvir Bolic, the man who shocked Manchester United last week, stunned Italy on Wednesday with the winning goal as Bosnia celebrated their first home soccer international with a 2-1 win.</p>
<p>Bolic, who plays in Turkey with Fenerbahce, ended Manchester United's 40-year unbeaten home record in Europe last week with a late goal but at the Kosevo Stadium on Wednesday he found the net earlier, scoring in the 43rd minute.</p>
<p>He sidestepped goalkeeper Francesco Toldo in the right of the area and hit home an angled shot.</p>
<p>Hamburg player Hasan Salihamidzic had earlier put Bosnia ahead in the fifth minute, with Enrico Chiesa equalising for the visitors with a fierce shot in the 11th.</p>
<p>The result of the match, played on a sunny and cloudless afternoon, had been widely held to be secondary on a day when symbolism and goodwill were predominant.</p>
<p>But there was unlikely to be much goodwill in Italy towards beleaguered coach Arrigo Sacchi whose team lacked several regular players due to domestic club commitments but still carried the reputation of World Cup finalists.</p>
<p>Sacchi, who inexplicably substituted Chiesa for the second half, already faces mounting calls for his dismissal in Italy and the Bosnian match could well be his last. </p>
<p>His improvised team dominated much of the game but failed to find the finishing touch.</p>
<p>"We were almost perfect up to the start of the match," declared Sacchi afterwards, with no hint of a smile.</p>
<p>"Italian soccer is going through a difficult period right now, you have to realise that...I could make 1,000 excuses but I won't. Professionally, we didn't do what we had to do."</p>
<p>Italy's strikers, including Middlesbrough's Fabrizio Ravanelli, repeatedly missed their target -- unlike the Serb gunners who destroyed the stadium during the war.</p>
<p>Despite the newly-laid athletics track -- used for an international meeting last month -- and perfect playing field, reminders of the bombardments that killed 10,000 Sarajevans during the 44-month-long war were omnipresent.</p>
<p>"This is exactly what we need after the atrocities of the war," said 23-year-old former soldier Zaim Gabela, sitting in a wheelchair at the edge of the athletics track.</p>
<p>"Even during the war, when people suffered so much, we still wanted to play sport. And we did play, sometimes on this pitch which was not green then but mud," said Gabela, injured in 1994 in the eastern enclave of Gorazde.</p>
<p>The early kick-off time -- 1230 GMT -- was due to the stadium floodlights being out of action.</p>
<p>Chanting fans waving blue and white Bosnian flags walked to the stadium past a burned-out indoor sports hall, United Nations armoured cars and coils of barbed wire.</p>
<p>Rows of graves, on a former soccer training ground that became a cemetery during the war, stood on the slopes of a hill behind the destroyed stadium scoreboard.</p>
<p>Rocket-scarred apartment blocks, with boarded-up windows, provide a further backdrop to the match.</p>
<p>A large banner saying "Grazie Azzurri" (Thanks Italy) hung from the concrete shell of the scoreboard.</p>
<p>Rows of khaki-clad Italian soldiers filled the centre of the restored stand opposite the VIP seats, providing loud support for the visitors and waving tricolour flags.</p>
<p>"I'm so happy to see the Italians here," said wheelchair-bound 26-year-old Remzija Spahovic, shot by a sniper while crossing a road.</p>
<p>"During the war Italy was the friendliest country towards us and they helped our sport a lot," he said.</p>
