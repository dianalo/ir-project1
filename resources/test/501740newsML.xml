<p>SUGAR - World market for April 9, 1997</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London continued to push higher in late afternoon trade buoyed by a strong New York market ending firmer across the board. Traders said spot May tested the waters above $312.50 resistance, at one point before closing just below the highs as the position continued to square up ahead of expiry next week. May closed at $312.50 a tonne, slightly off the seven-week high, but still up $1.90 from Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders said the London market was likely to see more against actuals and crosses in overall volume as part of the usual book-squaring ahead of the spot May contract's expiry next week. Raw sugar futures in New York were lifted by fund buying settling just below six-months highs made earlier in the day amid heavy, technically-driven activity, floor sources said. The benchmark May contract rose to 11.36 cents, its highest level since reaching 11.37 cents on September 13, before easing back slightly by the close to end at 11.31 cents/lb, up 0.27 cents/lb, while the outer months finished 0.26 to 0.07 cents/lb firmer.</p>
<p>There was no fundamental news to back the surge in prices and analysts expect the May contract to ease back towards 11.00 cents in the next few days, since open interest in May 11.00 calls remain high ahead of options expiry.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>EUROPE - Sugar beet plantings are now well underway in a majority of the growing regions with delays only reported from Poland and part of Germany due to cold weather. Temperatures over the next week are forecast to be cool at times, keeping planting efforts slow in these regions. In the western majority of the beet belt in the United Kingdom and France, continued dry conditions with mainly above normal temperatures have helped to complete sowings earlier than average. Precipitation has largely been absent from the western belt through the past months and a half.</p>
<p>Moisture reserves are lowering, but there is no immediate danger to the crop. However, showers will be needed by the end of the month to support early development of the crop.</p>
<p>MEXICO - Mexico expects to export close to 600,000 tonnes of sugar in 1997 on top of a record 4.4-million-tonne harvest expected for 1996/97 (November/October), Commerce Minister Herminio Blanco told the F.O. Licht World Sugar and Sweeteners Conference in Cancun. Blanco said that in the last two years, Mexico exported a combined total of 670,000 tonnes of sugar. The export estimate would place Mexico firmly in the camp of net exporters as imports are likely to hit 290,000 tonnes this year, according to figures by the National Sugar Chamber.</p>
<p>CZECH REPUBLIC - Czech exports continue to surge ahead after the country reaped a very good crop in 1996/97 (September/August) amounting to 663,000 tonnes, raw value, up from 500,000 tonnes the previous year. Exports in February, 1997, amounted 9,196 tonnes, up from last year's 1,388 tonnes. This brought cumulative exports in the first half of the 1996/97 campaign (September/February) up to 35,979 tonnes against 14,447 tonnes in the like period the previous year. Total imports in 1995/96 amounted to 27,684 tonnes compared to 35,029 tonnes in 1994/95. The Czech Republic exports mainly to central and eastern European destinations.</p>
<p>TENDERS</p>
<p>The European Union awarded 42,600 tonnes of white sugar at a maximum refund of ECU 43.737 per 100 kg at its weekly tender on April 9. Cumulative awards so far made under the 1996/97 series of tenders for the period up to April 9 reached 1,777,050 tonnes, which compares to 1,890,448 tonnes last year. Iran tendered to buy one cargo of white sugar for shipment between May 15 and June 15, European sugar traders said. Earlier this week Iran was reported to have bought one to two cargoes of white sugar for the same shipment period. Details of the price have yet to emerge.</p>
