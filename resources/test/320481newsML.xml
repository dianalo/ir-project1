<p>RLI Corp on Tuesday said the Federal Accounting Standards Board was considering a proposal to require companies to report comprehensive earnings to shareholders as prominently as it does GAAP (generally acceptable accounting principles) earnings.</p>
<p>It said the main difference was that along with underwriting profit and investment income, comprehensive earnings included unrealized gains or losses after tax.</p>
<p>RLI's reported GAAP earnings (loss) per share and comprehensive EPS for the past five years are as follows:</p>
<p>   Reported Primary			    Comprehensive</p>
<p>GAAP Earnings Per Share		    Earnings Per Share</p>
<p> 1992     $2.26			     $2.59</p>
<p> 1993     $2.10			     $2.79</p>
<p> 1994     $(0.61)			   $(1.09)</p>
<p> 1995     $1.01			     $4.00</p>
<p> 1996     $3.25			     $5.32</p>
<p> Total    $8.01			     $13.61</p>
<p>RLI underwrites selected property and casualty insurance products.</p>
