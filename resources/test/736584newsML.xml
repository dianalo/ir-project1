<p>Being funny has always been easy for Martin Short. Being a comedian has not.</p>
<p>He is reserved and stone-faced when he talks about his long career in standup, film and television and describes one of his most popular performances, his one-year stint on Saturday Night Live in 1984, as "endlessly high pressure."</p>
<p>A more recent attempt to bring his late-night sort of offbeat sarcasm to primetime television, he says, led him to adopt a cynical philosophy about his work: "If you try to do adventurous things, you will usually fail."</p>
<p>"The Martin Short Show" was canceled in 1994 after just three episodes on NBC.</p>
<p>It is not until Short recalls his childhood in a big family in Ontario that he lightens up and remembers his real inspiration for becoming a comic.</p>
<p>"I was the youngest of five children and everyone in the family was funny. So it was sort of like trickle-down comedy," he said. "When that becomes the norm you just take it up in your life because you're just behaving the way you behave in your house."</p>
<p>But leaving that relaxed environment for the money-driven world of show busines has taken its toll. Short concedes he now thinks his own chidren are funnier than he is. "I'm more forced and desperate," he said, only half joking.</p>
<p>RETURN TO MORE LIGHT-HEARTED HUMOR</p>
<p>In his latest project, the children's film "A Simple Wish" opening nationwide this weekend, Short has attempted to return to that more light-hearted sort of humor. He plays a male fairy godmother who has the best of intentions but has not quite perfected his trade. Every time he waves his magic wand he gets an unintended result, creating a string of complications he must undo before he can make good on a little girl's "simple wish."</p>
<p>"I've had a lot of strange roles but I would say that this one is up there," Short told Reuters in an interview. "You can always play a detective and say 'Freeze!'," he explained, mimicking the stereotypical action of a television police show. "It's just not that much fun because you're one of hundreds of actors who have played the same role. When you're playing a male fairy godmother, the list shrinks."</p>
<p>After 26 years in show business, Short is accustomed to defending his sustained preference for comedy roles. Unlike many young comedians who used the form as an entree into film before crossing over to serious drama, Short continues to tap the same talent that got him his start in Canadian television.</p>
<p>PLUMBING THE DEPTHS</p>
<p>He says he keeps the work interesting by plumbing the depths of the characters he creates so that they -- fairy godmothers aside -- are convincing as real people, which makes their quirks all the more engaging.</p>
<p>His Saturday Night Live character, the hyperactive, "Wheel of Fortune"-obsessed Ed Grimley, was based on a composite of a few people he knew.</p>
<p>"All I was doing was studying his life. It works as long as it doesn't look like you're trying to make them look funny," said Short, who wrote all his own sketches for "Saturday Night Live." "There are a lot of weird characters out there. They do exist."</p>
<p>That was a message that took some time to get across when Short was making the "Father of the Bride" films. He recalls the director feared he was making his character, the flamboyant wedding consultant, "a little too crazy."</p>
<p>"I said to him, 'Take a walk down Rodeo Drive and check out the people in some of those stores. They're a lot more outlandish.'"</p>
