<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets near midday Tuesday remained inactive, as packer buyers and cattle owners continued a standoff, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Packer bids ranged from $65.00 to $66.00 per cwt and were passed by owners pricing cattle at $69.00 to $70.00.</p>
<p>Prices this week, once sales occur, were seen steady to $1 higher, compared with last week's top at $68.00, sources said.</p>
<p>Fed cattle prices were expected to be supported amid talk that packers were running low on live cattle inventories and would need to replenish stocks by Wednesday or Thursday.  </p>
<p>But sources said price strength could be limited by the fact some cattle left unsold last week were carried over to this week's showlists.</p>
<p>Gains in feedlot cattle prices this week also could be pared if beef prices continue working lower, they said.</p>
<p>Beef prices at midday were quoted down $1.05 to $2.04 per cwt on 273 fabricated beef loads sold, USDA said.</p>
<p>The price of heavier-weight choice beef was quoted down $1.05 at $104.92 -- down $2.87 from last Tuesday's close, USDA statistics showed.</p>
