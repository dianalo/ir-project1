<p>Norwegian shares continued a downward slide on Wednesday but attention was focused on the financial sector after Norway's second biggest bank Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse and the largest insurer Storebrand announced they planned to merge.</p>
<p>Turnover was high for the banks and insurance groups, while the industrials languished. Dealers said the market would remain turbulent for the next few weeks or even months.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of reasons for investors to be cautious and to take a breather," said one analyst, citing worries over interest rates and the current union/employer wage arbitration.</p>
<p>He added that companies would begin to release first quarter earnings soon and there also is the revised budget in May.</p>
<p>"People are beginning to remember that a market can move in two directions, which they appeared to have forgotten," he said.</p>
<p>Oslo's Total share index closed 0.8 percent down at 1,034.27 points in turnover of 1.76 billion crowns, which was boosted by 505 million crowns in trade in Storebrand and Christiania.</p>
<p>Christiania gained six percent to end at 24.50 crowns, while Storebrand rose 6.3 percent to 47.50 crowns.</p>
<p>Trade also was active in Fokus Bank, itself seen as an acquisition target, which ended 0.50 crowns up at 57.50.</p>
