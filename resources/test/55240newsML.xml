<p>The Czech Council of Economic Ministers on Monday agreed to deregulate the price of district heating, Labour and Social Affairs Minister Jindrich Vodicka said.</p>
<p>Following a meeting of the council Vodicka told reporters the ministers agreed to switch "from regulated prices to prices adopted according to inflation and other normal indicators."</p>
<p>He said the ministers also agreed that there should be some type of social compensation to soften the impact of the decision on those unable to pay.</p>
<p>District heating plants account for most of the heat provided to the large Communist-era housing estates where many Czechs live, and are heavily subsidised by the state.</p>
<p>The issue of deregualtion of utilities prices has been one of the most sensitive in the Czech post-Communist reforms.</p>
<p>Vodicka said this all must be first approved by the full cabinet before the final budget plan for 1997 is approved. That is expected within the next two weeks.</p>
<p>The full cabinet, which rarely rejects decisions of the economic ministers, has its next regular meeting on Wednesday.</p>
