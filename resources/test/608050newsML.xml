<p>France's ruling right and its leftist challengers stepped up their row over the European single currency as the campaign for the first round of a parliamentary election entered its penultimate day on Thursday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe and Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin sparred over charges that a leftist victory in the tight May 25-June 1 National Assembly election could stop France joining the euro and set off a European crisis.</p>
<p>Juppe repeated fellow-Gaullist President Jacques Chirac's warning that power-sharing with a leftist premier would prevent France from speaking with a single voice on Europe.</p>
<p>He said the Socialists' conditions for joining the euro could not be met, and their spending promises would make it impossible for the country to abide by its Maastricht Treaty commitments.</p>
<p>"The conditions set by Mr Jospin for the euro are geared to make it fail...There would be a crisis in Europe," he said, adding the Socialist-Communist election alliance was heading from cacophony to divorce.</p>
<p>Juppe accused Jospin of letting his hands be tied by his allies, seizing on the Communists' warning that they would see imposing austerity needed to stick to the Maastricht timetable as a breach of their alliance with the Socialists.</p>
<p>Jospin denied that power-sharing would trigger a crisis in the European Union where, he said, two-thirds of governments were led by, or included Socialists and social democrats.</p>
<p>He said French democracy was mature and could "expect a forthcoming 'cohabitation' with serenity in the light of past experiences" -- power-sharing between the late Socialist president Francois Mitterrand and Gaullists Chirac in 1986-88 and Edouard Balladur in 1993-95.</p>
<p>Overdramatising the issue, he said, showed the right was running scared of defeat. The last opinion polls allowed to be published last weekend showed the left gnawing at the lead of the ruling centre-right.</p>
<p>Jospin said both conservatives and Communists were drawing closer to his conditions for joining the euro in 1999 -- mainly a more flexible interpretation of the Maastricht criteria.</p>
<p>The two camps also sparred on the economy, with Juppe saying the euro would fuel steady growth and bring down record 12.8 percent unemployment and Jospin calling for a boost to consumers to revive a languid economy.</p>
<p>In a sign of disagreement with the Communists, who call for blanket hikes on low salaries, Jospin told the daily Le Parisien he opposed immediate, massive rises and proposed a five-year plan to boost the wage-earners' share in the economy.</p>
<p>There was more sparring as Juppe told the business daily Les Echos that a fresh batch of privatisations was on the way, possibly this year, including the sale of national airline Air France and bank Credit Lyonnais to be followed by insurance group Gan and its banking arm CIC.</p>
<p>Jospin said more privatisation was an admission of failure by the government. "They need to privatise companies only to balance their budget," he told TF1 television.</p>
<p>As human rights groups urged people to go and vote in order to stop the extreme-right, National Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen returned to his favourite theme -- sending home immigrants who he said had taken one million jobs from French people.</p>
<p>"They will leave, because I will have told them there are no cherries left on the cherry tree," he said.</p>
<p>Le Pen said the Front could burst into parliament with 10 to 15 seats. Polls have said it would win a couple at most.</p>
