<p>A left-wing Sandinista activist was decapitated by a supporter of the victorious right-wing Liberal Alliance in Nicaragua's first politically motivated murder after its disputed recent elections, a Sandinista-owned newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rufino Espinoza Betanco, 40, was decapitated by a machete-stroke from his Liberal drinking companion on Sunday in a bar in San Francisco del Norte, 100 miles (160 kms) northwest of Managua, police told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Sandinista newspaper said Liberal supporter Oscar Ordonez, after a heated discussion with Espinoza over the results of the Oct. 20 vote, hit him twice over the head with a rock before decapitating him as he lay unconscious on a table. Police have Ordonez in custody.</p>
<p>It is the third act of violence reported by police that followed election-related disputes, with two less serious assaults taking place in the capital Managua.</p>
<p>"Betanco's life was ended due to the plague of political intolerance that is propagating in this country," a National Police report said. Police have banned demonstrations in Managua to avoid bloodshed as, 10 days after general elections plagued by allegations of irregularities, official winners still have not been announced.</p>
<p>President Violeta Chamorro issued a call for calm on Tuesday as social tensions rose, fed by charges of fraud and premature victory celebrations. She urged Nicaragua's Supreme Election Council to hurry up the vote count to prevent a social explosion. Officials results are expected in mid-November.</p>
<p>Tensions are highest in Managua where the left-wing Sandinistas and the Liberals have both claimed their candidate won the mayoral race. Sandinista candidate Carlos Guadamuz, trailing in the official vote count, has said his party's vote count gives him the win and has called on his supporters to defend his victory to the "ultimate consequences."</p>
<p>In the presidential race, Liberal candidate Arnoldo Aleman has already claimed victory after the preliminary vote count gave him an 11-point lead, but his Sandinista rival, former President Daniel Ortega, has refused to concede, alleging "serious irregularities" in the vote count.</p>
<p>The disputed vote, which saw the political centre disappear, has left Nicaragua polarised into hostile camps of right-wing Liberals and left-wing Sandinistas.</p>
