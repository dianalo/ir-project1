<p>Chemicals produced by sponges to keep barnacles and other unwelcome visitors away are a new focus of interest for cancer and AIDS researchers, a marine biologist said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But no one really knows enough about sponges to make a systematic search, Michelle Kelly-Borges, an expert on sponges at London's Natural History Museum, said.</p>
<p>"Marine sponges are the greatest known source of chemicals with the potential to treat human illness," Kelly-Borges told a lecture at the British Association for the Advancement of Science annual festival in Birmingham.</p>
<p>"It is thought that these compounds evolved to deter competition and disease in nature. Several compounds from sponges are currently being tested for their effectiveness against cancer, AIDS, fungus infections and inflammation."</p>
<p>One chemical, dubbed discodermolide after the species of sponge it comes from, disrupts the process of cell growth. Tests by the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution in Florida show it acts to stop breast cancer, Kelly-Borges said.</p>
<p>It was not yet clear how this happened, but surface markers on the cancerous cell may look like the surface of some organism the sponge considered an enemy.</p>
<p>Another sponge found off New Zealand was being tested against the HIV virus that causes AIDS, she said.</p>
<p>Sponges have a complex immune system that allows them to recognise each other and to identify foreign species she said.</p>
<p>They produced compounds that may protect them from being eaten, discourage larvae from settling on them, or deter their neighbours from growing on them -- something like the chemicals painted on ships' hulls to stop barnacles.</p>
<p>But there are 10,000 to 15,000 different species of sponges and it was often hard to tell one from the other.</p>
<p>Drug companies and groups like the U.S. National Cancer Institute are searching for sponges that could offer magic bullet compounds to fight diseases. But they were wasting time and money, as well as damaging ecosystems, with random searches.</p>
<p>"Better identification can help prevent wholesale harvesting of sponges in the hunt for drugs," she said.</p>
