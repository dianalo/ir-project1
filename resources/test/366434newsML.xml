<p>The Co-Operative Wholesale Society Ltd (CWS) said on Monday that it had "no plans to dispose of CWS businesses or assets" to Lanica Trust or its head Andre Regan.</p>
<p>CWS was responding to a statement from Lanica on Sunday that a company in which it had an investment would approach CWS to discuss the possible purchase of non-food businesses.  </p>
<p>CWS said in a statement that it had not been in talks with Regan and had no prior notification from him.</p>
<p>Lanica's shares were suspended on the stock exchange on Monday pending an announcement from the company after The Sunday Times newspaper reported that it was expected to make a 500 million stg bid for CWS's petrol stations, undertaking, chemist, optician and department store businesses.</p>
<p>CWS is a co-operative business which focuses on food supermarkets.</p>
<p>Lanica is incorporated in the Channel Island of Guernsey and its shares staged a phenomenal rise last year after entrepeneur Regan took over when the stock was trading at 203 pence.</p>
<p>Last month, privately-owned retail and gambling group Littlewoods ruled out speculation that it might use Lanica as a vehicle for listing all or part of its business.</p>
<p>Shares in the company were last quoted at 1,937.5 pence, within sight of their 12-month trading high of 2,100 pence.</p>
