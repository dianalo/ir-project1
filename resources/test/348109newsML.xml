<p>Ashland Inc's planned spin off of its exploration unit will free capital investment for areas expected to yield greater returns, analysts said Thursday.</p>
<p>"They don't want to commit capital to areas where they don't have a major presence," said analyst John B. Parry at John S. Herold Inc. "In the oil business you've got to invest for the long term. They want to put cash flow in areas where there is a quicker return."</p>
<p>Ashland Inc said Thursday it would offer less than 20 percent of its Ashland Exploration unit via an initial public offering. The transaction is still subject to regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>Ashland Exploration is a domestic and international producer of natural gas and crude oil. The unit accounted for 10 percent of Ashland Inc's revenues in fiscal 1996 ended September 30.</p>
<p>The transaction is expected to occur in late spring or summer and be followed by a tax-free spinoff of Ashland Inc's remaining ownership in the unit to Ashland Inc shareholders.</p>
<p>Analysts said the exploration segment will positively contribute to Ashland Inc's fiscal 1997 earnings because the unit has been consistently profitable.</p>
<p>But they added it was too soon to tell how the spinoff of the segment will impact fiscal 1998 earnings.</p>
<p>Ashland Inc earned $2.97 per share in fiscal 1996 ended September 30. Wall Street's estimate for fiscal 1997 is $2.75, based on a range of $2.50 to $3.05 per share, according to First Call.</p>
<p>Ashland Inc Chairman Paul W. Chellgren said at the company's annual meeting Thursday the company expects to have no ownership of the exploration unit by the end of calendar year '97.</p>
<p>Ashland Inc's primary businesses are petroleum refining and marketing, as well as chemicals and energy. "They have no real major emphasis in (exploration,") Parry said. "(The unit) was a sink for capital, offset partially by cash flow. It was a zero sum game, the way they were playing it."</p>
<p>Chellgren said at the annual meeting proceeds from the offering will go to businesses that have been targeted as growth areas, including chemicals and road building and construction.</p>
<p>Chellgren, 54, was elected chairman at the meeting following the retirement of former Chairman John Hall, 65.</p>
<p>"We're excited about (the unit's) growth opportunities...we feel that its market value is not being fully recognized in our corporate structure," Chellgren told shareholders.</p>
<p>The unit posted pretax operating income of $21 million in fiscal 1996, which included a $73 million settlement.</p>
<p>At the end of the same fiscal year, Ashland Exploration had $1.1 billion of property, plant and equipment assets.</p>
<p>"(The public offering) allows Ashland Inc to maximize the value of the corporation," said Richard Cohen at Starr Securities. "They're getting rid of an ancillary business."</p>
<p>Analysts said the move was not unexpected. Ashland Inc said late last year it was considering options for improving profitability. "This has definitely been under consideration," Cohen said.</p>
<p>Shares of Ashland Inc were up 1/4 to 43 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
