<p>Dutch shares powered to another record high on Wednesday, although a weaker start to Wall Street trade sapped some of the market's strength late in the session.</p>
<p>The AEX index of leading stocks finished at 661.67 points, up 3.84 points or 0.58 percent on the previous close, also a record. The market also hit a fresh intra-day peak at 664.47.</p>
<p>"There is really nothing negative you can say about this market. All the background signs are positive," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Wall Street close on Tuesday and a firm domestic bond market had started share trading off on a positive note, with buying interest focused early on financial stocks.</p>
<p>Profit-taking crept in towards the close but banks ING and ABN AMRO finished with solid gains, heading the volume list.</p>
<p>ING ended 2.10 guilders higher at 67.40 and ABN AMRO 1.60 up at 117.60. Dealers noted a report from stockbrokers ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, which estimated the likely positive effect on the banks' earnings from hidden reserves and provisions to cover possible loan losses. The banks must unveil these reserves as part of reporting their full results in the coming months.</p>
<p>Other main index movers included Philips Electronics, supported by strong earnings from U.S. semiconductor maker Intel on Tuesday, which closed up 0.50 guilders at 74.50.</p>
<p>Philips also announced the closure of its loss-making retail outlet Superclub, which rented and sold videotapes, CDs and multi-media entertainment packages. Philips said it could no longer sustain the losses at the largely Belgian-based unit.</p>
<p>Intel's more than doubling of fourth quarter earnings had a more marked impact on Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASM Lithography, which surged 8.00 guilders, 8.08 percent to 107.00.</p>
<p>Despite the market coming off its highs late in the session, dealers said it remained in good shape. Having burst through key resistance at 655 points, this had turned into solid near-term support. There was now little resistance above the market.</p>
<p>Another factor which could impact on the market tomorrow was Friday's option expiry, ahead of which option writers may be forced into the cash market to cover themselves.</p>
<p>According to Daiwa Europe strategist Roger Monson this extra buying could be enough to push the AEX above 680 on Friday.</p>
<p>But he added the successive peaks scored by the Dutch share market meant that Amsterdam's 1996 position, eighth among 17 European bourses on a dollar return basis would not continue.</p>
<p>"Despite the high quality of Dutch companies and the market's earnings predictability, we cannot argue for more than a return matching the European average for the next months."</p>
