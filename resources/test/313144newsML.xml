<p>The United States and its European alllies have decided to offer a fresh package of incentives designed to soften Russian antagonism toward NATO expansion, the Washington Post reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Quoting unidentified alliance diplomats, the newspaper said the inducements would include new flexibility on arms control problems, greater economic assistance and a special consultative status.</p>
<p>The consulting role would give Russia a seat at NATO's table -- though not the veto Moscow seeks -- in mulling policy on common problems such as nuclear proliferation, regional defence, terrorism, international crime and peacekeeping.</p>
<p>In a report from Berlin, the Post said the plan would be broached on Monday when NATO Secretary General Javier Solana opened negotiations with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on a special NATO relationship with Moscow. The two men had scheduled five hours of discussion at an official guest house near Moscow.</p>
<p>The timetable now called for the whole package to be ready by the June summit of the world's leading industrial democracies in Denver, Colorado, to which Russian President Boris Yeltsin would be invited, according to the report.</p>
<p>Alliance sources told the Post the purpose was to give Yeltsin at least two weeks to sell the package at home before NATO announced its candidates for membership at a Madrid summit conference in July.</p>
<p>U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott made a quick tour of allied capitals this week, including London, Brussels, Paris and Bonn. The Post said Talbott reviewed NATO's agenda in detail during the visits.</p>
<p>Leaders of 16 NATO countries are to meet in Madrid on July 8-9 to formally invite some ex-communist countries in Eastern Europe to join the western alliance. Hungary, Poland and the Czech republic are considered the front-runners, but Romania and Slovenia are also being discussed for early admittance.</p>
<p>Alliance officials also want to negotiate a special charter with Moscow that would ensure Russia did not feel excluded from the new Europeran security structures but was engaged in a close and cooperative relationship with NATO.</p>
<p>Russia is vehemently opposed to enlarging NATO to include former Soviet bloc countries, insisting this would threaten its security and create new divisions in Europe.</p>
