<p>Finnish Finance Minister and Conservative Party chairman Sauli Niinisto said in a newspaper column on Tuesday that he would vote in favour of more nuclear power if the issue came up in parliament.</p>
<p>"If parliament votes on nuclear power I will certainly vote in favour of nuclear power," Niinisto wrote in a column in daily Turun Sanomat.  </p>
<p>He said Finland's own target -- part of a target for the entire European Union area -- to reduce its carbon dioxide emissions to the 1990 level by 2010 was "monstruous".</p>
<p>"Without new energy policy decisions the EU savings decision would entail so big increases in energy taxes and in energy consumer prices that there would be reason to forget the hopes to, for example, halve unemployment," Niinisto said.</p>
<p>"We would be faced with a sharp fall in our standard of living," he added.</p>
<p>Nuclear power was now the only viable option due to the EU's decision to reduce carbon monoxide emissions, Niinisto said.  </p>
<p>Disregarding the EU decision, Finland's realistic choices for increased energy production stood between coal and nuclear power, he said, adding there was not sufficient certainty about the secure supply at a moderate price of natural gas.</p>
<p>"After the EU's emission decision one can reach no other conclusion than to support expanding nuclear power," Niinisto said.</p>
<p>He noted that the Green Party, whose only cabinet portfolio is held by Environment Minister Pekka Haavisto, was supporting more coal power production and said this demonstrated that the Greens' only energy policy was to oppose more nuclear power.  </p>
<p>"The Minister of the Environment was there making the EU decision on carbon emissions. So he is, at the same time, supporting an increase and a cutback in carbon dioxide emissions," Niinisto said.</p>
<p>He also criticised Social Democratic Party chairman, Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen's recent warnings to not risk the unity of the government by opening the door to more nuclear power.</p>
<p>"One could of course ask sarcastically what Finland is more in need of; safe and cheap energy or a government," he wrote, adding, however, that a change of government was unlikely to alter the situation much.  </p>
<p>Niinisto said the opposition Centre Party's deputy chairman Seppo Kaariainen last weekend voiced the view that a new nuclear power plant was not a topical alternative.</p>
<p>"Just a few years ago the same deputy chairman, when he was minister of trade and industry, was promoting the campaign for a new nuclear power plant," he said, adding the Centre Party's energy policy was as consistent as the Greens' environmental policy.</p>
<p>Referring to an energy policy report due to be passed to parliament by the government this spring or in the autumn, Niinisto he said he expected parliament would make a choice.  </p>
<p>"I assume that parliament will have to make a stance on whether Finland's path will be the black of coal or the green of nuclear," Niinisto said.</p>
<p>Referring to a possible vote in parliament for or against more nuclear power and to his own decision to vote in favour, Niinisto said: "I think that I am not the only conservative cabinet minister who will do that."</p>
