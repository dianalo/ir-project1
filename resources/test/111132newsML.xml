<p>Shares on Friday returned to a rise, shaking off early gloom as investors wary of pricier European bourses and bonds hunted out less well-known opportunities, brokers said.</p>
<p>The HEX index picked up 0.99 percent to 2,184.82 with volume a solid 500 million markka, about one-third in Nokia.</p>
<p>"Underlying sentiment is quite sluggish but liquidity is very good and it has to go somewhere," said one broker.</p>
<p>Nokia ticked ahead, ending well above its 200 markka support at 206.00, up 5.00, after being attacked by bears late Thursday.</p>
<p>Neste found favour on its "macho" crude loss write-down.</p>
<p>The oil group turned in an unexpected eight-month loss of 26 million markka including 495 million for losses in crude oil derivatives. Initially dubious investors finally welcomed the news for clearing the air and paving the way forward in 1997.</p>
<p>Neste initially fell but turned up, closing up one markka at 93.00 markka -- although volume was very light.</p>
<p>Stronger than Neste though with less attention-grabbing news was Huhtamaki, which reported eight-month profits up 42 percent and sounded roundly optimistic for 1996; helping its stock by 2.00 markka to 169.00.</p>
<p>Otherwise, only forestries continued glum ahead of results from industry heavyweights next week. Enso and UPM-Kymmene both extended recent losses as investors prepared for a weak showing.</p>
