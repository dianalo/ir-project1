<p>A new strike at General Motors Corp.'s Pontiac East truck plant Wednesday pushed to more than 33,000 the number of workers idled by some of the most intense auto industry labor strife in years.</p>
<p>GM is now battling strikes by the United Auto Workers at at two major assembly plants, while Chrysler Corp. is facing mounting losses from a walkout at a key engine plant in Detroit that has forced it to shut down six North American truck plants.</p>
<p>"I don't remember in recent times where you had three strikes going at once and many more waiting in the wings," said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
<p>In each of the local disputes, including those that have not yet boiled over into strikes, the issue is the replacement or preservation of jobs.</p>
<p>Analysts said Wednesday that the strikes are symptoms of a major clash between automakers' drive to reduce costs to stay competitive and workers' desires to share in the industry's booming prosperity and maintain employment.</p>
<p>"We're seeing a lot of the unresolved issues from the 1996 contract playing themselves out on a local level," Shaiken said.</p>
<p>At Pontiac, about 5,400 members of UAW Local 594 struck GM's Pontiac East assembly plant and related facilities after an 11:59 p.m. EDT Tuesday strike deadline expired without an agreement for a new local labor contract. The plant makes GM's highly popular and profitable extended-cab Chevrolet and GMC full-size pickup trucks.</p>
<p>Another 450 members covered by the same pact went on strike at a nearby Lear Corp. plant that makes seats for the trucks.</p>
<p>The walkout is the sixth local strike GM has suffered in past six months over staffing levels.</p>
<p>"The members knew this was coming and they knew that this was the only way to get what we wanted," UAW Local President Ron Miller said of the strike. "This labor unrest has been going on at GM for years."</p>
<p>The union has demanded that GM hire about 600 additional workers at Pontiac East in order to restore adequate staffing for the plant's current production level. The three-shift facility is cranking out about 6,000 of the big pickups per week to meet strong consumer demand, and workers say they're worn out and need reinforcements.</p>
<p>The UAW has hit GM and Chrysler where it hurts most -- in their profitable light truck lines and new product launches.</p>
<p>A strike in its 19th day at GM's Oklahoma City car plant has held back the launch of its new Chevrolet Malibu and Oldsmobile Cutlass midsize cars.</p>
<p>The strike at Chrysler's Mound Road engine plant in Detroit, which started April 10, has deprived the company of Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicle, its Dodge Ram and Dakota pickukp trucks and its full-size vans.</p>
<p>The issues at Oklahoma City are much the same as at Pontiac, while the Chrysler strike is a showdown over shifting work to outside suppliers. Detroit's No. 3 automaker wants to shift production of drive shafts from the Mound Road plant to an outside supplier, a move that union officials say will cost about 250 jobs.</p>
<p>Exacerbating the disputes have been the record first quarter profits and fat executive bonuses recently reported by GM and Chrysler.</p>
<p>Burnham Securities analyst David Healy estimated that the Chrysler strike is siphoning $75 million a week from the company's bottom line -- or over $150 million so far -- while GM's weekly losses are about $18 million at Oklahoma City and will be $29 million a week at Pontiac East.</p>
<p>Negotiations are continuing at Oklahoma City, while new talks at Pontiac are not scheduled until Thursday morning. Chrysler has not even held any formal negotiations in the engine strike -- top company and union officials have spoken only over the telephone.</p>
<p>At Oklahoma City, UAW Local 1999 has demanded that GM replace some of the 900 jobs it eliminated when it began production of the Malibu and Cutlass late last year.</p>
<p>Other UAW locals that have requested permission to strike include those at a transmission plant in Warren, Mich., and an iron foundry in Saginaw, Mich.</p>
