<p>Outgoing Romanian President Ion Iliescu has pardoned six former senior communist officials who had been convicted of mass murder and abuse of power.</p>
<p>The pardons, reported by the Mediafax news agency two days before Iliescu was due to leave office, were granted to executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's chief ideologist and five other top communists who served under him.</p>
<p>All had been convicted in connection with attempts to suppress 1989 demonstrations against Ceausescu which culminated in his capture and execution. Several lesser-known people received pardons as did two journalists convicted of libel.</p>
<p>There was no one available at the president's office to confirm the report.</p>
<p>Iliescu, an ex-communist ousted in this month's election by centrist Emil Constantinescu, made no mention of the pardons, signed last week, at his final news conference on Tuesday outlining his record in office.</p>
<p>Dumitru Popescu, who Romanians dubbed "God" because he was in charge of everything, was responsible for making Ceausescu's hardline policies during the dictator's final years in power.</p>
<p>Lina Ciobanu, Nicolae Constantin, Constantin Olteanu, Gheorghe Oprea and Gheorghe Pana -- all members of the defunct Communist Party's Politburo -- were also pardoned.</p>
<p>None of the six was in jail. All had been freed on health grounds over the past four years, along with 10 other Politburo members jailed in 1991 on similar charges. More than 1,000 Romanians were killed during the upheaval seven years ago.</p>
<p>Two and a half years ago Iliescu had pardoned eight of the 16 Politburo members originally convicted.</p>
