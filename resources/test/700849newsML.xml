<p>France Telecom did not immediately comment on Tuesday on a report in the Financial Times saying it would have made a loss of 33.9 billion francs in 1996 under U.S. accounting rules.</p>
<p>The paper said that this loss would have been the biggest ever loss of a French company, outstripping Alcatel-Alsthom's 1995 net loss of 25.6 billion francs.</p>
<p>France Telecom reported a profit of 2.1 billion in 1996. The difference in the French and U.S rules concerns a one-off 37.5 billion franc payment to the French state in return for the government assuming the pension liabilities of civil servants working at France Telecom.</p>
<p>This was not taken as a charge on the results in France but would be a "withdrawal expense" under U.S. rules.</p>
