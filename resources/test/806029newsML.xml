<title>USA: Virginia military college admits women.</title>
<headline>Virginia military college admits women.</headline>

<p>Virginia Military Institute registered a freshman class on Monday that included women for the first time, ending 158 years of male-only education at the state-supported military college.</p>
<p>The arrival of women at the campus followed a six-year legal battle that ended when the U.S. Supreme Court ordered it to accept female students or stop accepting taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>"We feel very confident and very calm," said VMI superintendant Gen. Josiah Bunting at a news conference. "The sooner we get started the better."</p>
<p>The women cadets lined up with their male counterparts at Cameron Hall to register but were not scheduled to begin their rigorous schooling until Tuesday, when they will undergo academic testing and have their hair cut close to the scalp in the traditional buzzcuts.</p>
<p>School officials expected 31 women would register in an incoming class of 466 by day's end. The cadets were shielded from some 150 journalists who arrived at the campus to chronicle the event.</p>
<p>"The waiting is awful. It's going good, just not fast enough," said cadet Jen Jolin of Monterey, Virginia, as she waited in line to register.</p>
<p>"The history of cadets being unhappy, even on the first day, is rich," Bunting said.</p>
<p>In a landmark ruling in June 1996, the high court said the all-male admissions policy at VMI, the nation's oldest military college, unconstitutionally discriminated against women.</p>
<p>The court also said VMI could not offer a separate military-style program for women as an alternative to becoming co-ed.</p>
<p>A host of changes, big and small, preceded the arrival of the women cadets. Skirts are now among the accepted uniforms. Pantyhose are sold at the student store.</p>
<p>South Carolina's previously all-male military college, The Citadel, accepted four female cadets last fall.</p>
<p>In January, two of the Citadel cadets, Kim Messer and Jeanie Mentavlos, said they would not return to class because they had been subjected to "disgusting" sexual harassment, which included being sprayed with fingernail polish and set on fire.</p>
<p>Bunting said he believed the inclusion of women at VMI would go more smoothly than at The Citadel because the school had a year to prepare, in which staff and students attended sexual harassment classes.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the new VMI cadets, who are prepared for the rigors of college life through seminars and videos, will walk under Jackson Arch and formally enter the Rat Line, a ritualized six-month indoctrination in which students are taunted and treated like vermin.</p>
<p>"No matter how many videos you see, it won't prepare you for the Rat Line," said Cadet Gardner Mundy, on hand for the arrival of the first women students.</p>
<p>"Can you yell at a woman without it being sexual harassment?" Bunting asked. "Yes, I believe you can because the Rat Line at its best is an impersonal system," he said.</p>
<p>Bunting said it would take some time for VMI to fully incorporate women in campus life.</p>
<p>"It will take one generation (four years) for there to be a sufficient cultural change so that people will have forgotten how contentious this day is."</p>
