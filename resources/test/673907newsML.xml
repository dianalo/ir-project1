<p>World importers of grain and oilseeds were warned on Thursday not to go too far in restricting trade in genetically modified products.</p>
<p>Speaking to the International Grains Council's conference in London Ralph Goodale, minister with responsibility for the Canadian Wheat Board, said that World Trade Organisation rules required countries "to refrain from measures that were more restrictive than necessary".</p>
<p>He stressed that there were rules on how countries could control imports on the basis of the need to preserve human and animal health.</p>
<p>Goodale hailed the use of biotechnology as a way of improving the efficiency of agriculture. "Canada's crop industry is in the midst of a second green revolution," he said.</p>
<p>His remarks follow formal approval by the European Commission on Wednesday of compulsory labelling of all genetically modified farm products from July 31 specifying the product "may contain or consist of genetically modified organisms".</p>
