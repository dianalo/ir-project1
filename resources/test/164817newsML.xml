<p>U.S. rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's assigned on Monday a long-term corporate credit rating of 'A' to Swedish forestry group AssiDoman AB and a short-term rating of 'A-1'.</p>
<p>The outlook for the ratings was stable, S&amp;P said in a statement.  </p>
<p>"AssiDoman is one of the most well-integrated forest products companies in Europe," S&amp;P said in a statement, adding that the company's massive forest holdings were a significant and stable source of cash flow.</p>
<p>The company's ventures in eastern Europe offered substantial growth potential, S&amp;P said, and the company was well poised to benefit from this.</p>
<p>AssiDoman has a strong financial profile, the agency said, with a net debt to capital ratio of just seven percent. This would enable the company to "expand beyond the means generated by its business," S&amp;P said.</p>
<p>"While it is anticipated that AssiDoman will continue to grow through acquisitions and that leverage could increase as a result, the group is nevertheless expected to maintain a sound financial profile," the agency said.</p>
