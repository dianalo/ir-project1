<p>German winter rapeseed and grain crops are developing normally but precipitation in December and January has been below average, the DWD meteorological office said.</p>
<p>"Crops are dormant and generally doing well, but we are keeping an eye on low soil moisture levels...the crops could do with more rain," a DWD source said.</p>
<p>The snow cover built up in recent weeks had not been high so that the current thaw would not bring enough moisture to offset the lack of rainfall, he added.</p>
<p>Damage from recent night frosts, which is not believed to be serious, should also become evident when the snow melts.</p>
<p>DWD forecast cold air, some rain in the West and North, and maximum day temperatures of two to four degrees for the next seven days.</p>
