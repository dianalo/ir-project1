<p>They all came to remember Jackie Robinson Tuesday: the president of the United States and the ordinary baseball fan, old Brooklyn Dodger teammates and young children just learning who he was.</p>
<p>Fifty years to the day after Robinson broke the colour line in major league baseball, President Bill Clinton saluted him in a special ceremony from the field at Shea Stadium after the fifth inning of the Los Angeles Dodgers' game against the New York Mets.</p>
<p>Clinton, who is recoving from knee surgery, hobbled onto the field using two black canes. He said Robinson and his teammates had proved that "America is a better, stronger, richer country when we all work together and give everyone a chance."</p>
<p>Added Clinton: "I can't help thinking if Jackie Robinson were here tonight he would say we have done a lot of good in the last 50 years, but we can do better."</p>
<p>Clinton saluted last weekend's record-breaking Masters victory by Tiger Woods, the first person of colour to win one of golf's major titles. The 21-year-old African-Asian-American was invited here but had previous vacation plans.</p>
<p>Clinton introduced Robinson's widow, Rachel, who said: "I believe the greatest tribute we can pay to Jackie Robinson is to gain new support for a more equitable society."</p>
<p>Afterwards, she told a few reporters: "It was very emotional for me. The crowd reaction was tremendous. I was caught up in America. I grew up in this country and the American people are good people. This energises and sustains the (civil rights) movement."</p>
<p>Acting commissioner Bud Selig announced that Robinson's uniform number 42 would be retired throughout the major leagues, although current players wearing the number -- such as the Mets' Butch Huskey and the Boston Red Sox' Mo Vaughn -- would be allowed to continue for the rest of their careers.</p>
<p>"Number 42 belongs to Jackie Robinson for the ages," said Selig of the unprecedented move.</p>
<p>Other observances honouring the anniversary include upcoming ceremonies at every major league ballpark, changing the name of New York's Interborough Parkway to Jackie Robinson Parkway, commemorative patches worn by umpires and players and a U.S. gold coin -- the first ever to feature a picture of an African-American.</p>
<p>The Jackie Robinson Foundation founded by his widow hopes to raise $12 million for its college scholarship programme in part through the coin programme. Major League Baseball is donating $1 million.</p>
<p>Former Dodgers such as Sandy Koufax, Joe Black and Ralph Branca, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson and filmmaker Spike Lee were among the other celebrities attending Tuesday.</p>
<p>Also in attendance was former Cleveland Indian Larry Doby, who a few months after Robinson's entry became the first black in the American League and faced the same kind of segregation and racism as his more famous National League counterpart.</p>
<p>"In baseball you are accustomed to be with your teammates on the road after the game. I didn't have that," said Doby. "Neither did Jackie. I spent a lot of lonely nights. So did he."</p>
<p>Former slugger Reggie Jackson recalled his childhood in Philadelphia. "I was 7 or 8 in 1951 when I heard about Jackie. I went to Shibe Park," said Jackson.</p>
<p>"Jackie hit 12 homers that year but he hit one the guy next to me caught. I was really excited."</p>
<p>Rev. Earl Jones, a Baptist pastor from Queens, explained why he had come with his 13-year-old son William: "For Jackie. He was for us comparable to Martin (Luther) King."</p>
<p>Said William: "He taught me I could do anything I want."</p>
<p>"This is important to me," said Dr. Ann Carpenter, a chiropractor. "He was always my hero and a role model for me even though I am a woman."</p>
<p>What did he stand for? "For justice. He was a person committed to his ideals. He sacrificed of himself for others."</p>
<p>Carpenter was seven when Robinson broke in, making her a fan of the Dodgers. Before that, growing up in Harlem, she followed the Negro Leagues.</p>
<p>Carpenter mentioned Vince Coleman, who on being named Rookie of the Year in 1985 revealed that he did not know -- or care -- who Robinson was.</p>
<p>"A few years ago when Vince Coleman said I play here because of my talent, nobody did anything for me -- here's a case of a person who needs to know his own heritage. That goes for all of us," she said.</p>
<p>By no means were all the Robinson fans black, of course. Sporting a faded old Brooklyn Dodgers jacket was accountant Steve Goldman. "For Jackie," he said. "My youth."</p>
<p>The social implications were not the main reason he loved Robinson, rather: "Because he was a great player -- exciting."</p>
