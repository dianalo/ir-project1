<headline>German bourse drifts higher, eyes upcoming holiday.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-05-16</dateline>

<p>German stocks opened bourse trading higher on Friday, supported both by Wall Street's gains and the slightly stronger dollar but no new records were in sight amid lower volumes before a three-day holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The blue-chip 30-share DAX index traded up nearly one percent at 3,592.67 points, mostly steady compared with pre-bourse levels.</p>
<p>But dealers said trading would likely be mostly listless as dealers were eyeing a three-day weekend, eager to head home early. All German markets will be closed on Monday and regular trading will resume on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"A jump above the record level of 3,612 points is unlikely today," a dealer said.</p>
<p>Shares in BHF Bank soared nearly eight percent on talk that Bankgesellschaft Berlin, fresh from announcing talks of a possible merger with NordLB, might be considering taking on BHF Bank as well. Both sides however said there was nothing to the talk.</p>
<p>Shares in utility VIAG were down slightly even though the group posted an increase in first quarter profits despite costs associated with the telecommunications business. The group also gave an upbeat outlook for the year.</p>
