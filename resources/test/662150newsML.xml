<p>Dollar bloc sectors Australia and Canada were the best performers in a positive week for all major bond markets, according to data provided by Salomon Brothers in New York.</p>
<p>Australian government bonds returned 1.43 percent in local currency terms in the week to June 12. The Salomon Brothers World Government Bond Index of 17 bond markets gained 0.65 percent overall.</p>
<p>Australian bond markets were buoyed for another cut in interest rates, particularly after a surprisingly large rise in domestic unemployment.  </p>
<p>Canadian bonds came in at second place in the index, at a gain in Canadian dollar terms of 1.38 percent. The market benefited from its safe haven status for European investors concerned about the timetable for European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Dollar bonds were the fourth best performers, with a return of 0.72 percent.</p>
<p>Major European bond markets recovered from EMU jitters over agreement on the budget stability pact to make broadly similar gains. German bonds returned 0.57 percent in marks, French bonds 0.53 percent in francs, Italian bonds 0.53 percent in lire and  </p>
<p>gilts were 0.56 percent higher in pounds.</p>
<p>Japanese government bonds (JGBs) made a 0.58 percent gain in yen. The strength of the yen translated that gain into a 2.02 percent upturn in U.S. dollar terms.</p>
<p>The World Government Bond Index rallied 1.03 percent overall in dollar terms.</p>
<p>Salomon's bond index is calculated using all government bonds with over one year to maturity, weighted for market capitalisation.
