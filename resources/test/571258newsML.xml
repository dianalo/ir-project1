<p>Yves Thibault de Silguy, European Commissioner responsible for monetray affairs, said in a radio interview on Thursday that a majority of countries would be ready to join the euro in 1999.</p>
<p>He said if there was uncertainty on France's intentions concerning the euro, with the opposition Socialist party wanting to put conditions on the country's entry, that could lead to higher French interest rates.</p>
<p>He told Europe 1 radio that he hoped Britain would join the euro and said the decision was up to Britain.  </p>
<p>Asked to comment on conditions the Socialists want to impose -- interpreting the budget criteria as trends and not fixed figures, entry of Italy and Spain from the start, abolition of stability pact -- Thibault de Silguy said "There are conditions in the Maastricht Treaty, there is no reason to add."</p>
<p>"If the criteria of the Maastricht Treaty .... are respected, the single currency will come to exist," he added.</p>
<p>"I believe that a majority of countries will be ready to pass to the single currency if its comes into force on January 1, 1999," he said.</p>
<p>He said it was false that the stability pact would stunt employment growth or even cost jobs, as some politicians claim.</p>
