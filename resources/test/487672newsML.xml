<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Monday were seen steady with a firm undertone, amid expectations for brisk competition among packers for tight hog supplies, livestock dealers and packer buyers said.</p>
<p>Marketings, particularly in the eastern Corn Belt have been crimped by increased spring fieldwork, they said.</p>
<p>The demand lifted cash hog prices Friday despite potential bearishness from news that Excel Corp was closing its Beardstown, Ill., hog plant Friday and Monday to upgrade regrigeration units, dealers said. Market sources said the plant has a daily slaughter capacity of 16,000 head.</p>
