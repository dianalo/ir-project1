<p>Chile are looking for a high-altitude pitch on which to train before their World Cup qualifier against Bolivia in La Paz on February 12, team officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Team representatives have been scouting sites in the Bolivian city of Oruro and the Peruvian city of Cuzco after deciding there was no adequate places high enough in their own country.</p>
<p>"We're going to need eight or nine days or so training in a high-altitude place to allow us to adapt a little," said Alberto Quintana, the Football Association of Chile's technical manager.</p>
<p>The thin oxygen of La Paz, 3,600 metres above sea level, has long been a problem for players from other countries.</p>
