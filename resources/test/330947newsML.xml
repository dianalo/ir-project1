<p>The former head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade said Friday he hopes a dispute over whether a U.S. anti-Cuba law violates World Trade Organization rules is settled outside WTO processes.</p>
<p>Peter Sutherland, who was designated chairman of the Overseas Development Council Thursday, said fallout from the dispute over the U.S. Helms-Burton law has the potential to shake confidence in the WTO and its ability to resolve major trade disputes.  </p>
<p>"I'm just simply saying that it's dangerous," Sutherland said in response to a question after speaking to a group of journalists at the National Press Club.</p>
<p>Rather than threaten the WTO's dispute-resolution mechanisms, Sutherland said he hopes the dispute is resolved by agreement of the parties, outside the auspices of the WTO.</p>
<p>Sutherland, a general partner of Goldman Sachs and chairman and managing director of Goldman Sachs International, was the director-general of GATT, which preceded the WTO. The OCD is a Washington-based research group that studies trade and multilateral institutions.</p>
<p>The WTO agreed to a European Union request in November to set up a panel to decide whether the U.S. law violates its rules.</p>
<p>The law, which punishes foreigners who invest in properties confiscated from Americans in Cuba, has been criticized by an overwhelming number of U.S. trading partners.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said that the anti-Cuba law falls under an untested "national security" clause of the two-year-old, 125-member WTO, under which countries can override WTO rules if they see their security at stake.</p>
