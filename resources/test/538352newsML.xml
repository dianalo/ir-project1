<p>Former Formula One world champion turned airline owner Niki Lauda has undergone a kidney transplant in Vienna, the Austrian news agency APA said on Friday.</p>
<p>APA said the 48-year-old Lauda had received a kidney from his younger brother Florian and both men were stable after Thursday's two-hour operation.</p>
<p>A spokesman at Vienna's AKH hospital said the brothers would stay in hospital for several days. Niki Lauda had asked for the operation to be kept secret until doctors were sure of a successful outcome.</p>
<p>Lauda had been suffering from a chronic kidney inflammation for some time. But the spokesman said the illness was not a consequence of the Austrian's horrific crash at the Nuerburgring Grand Prix in August 1976 when he suffered near-fatal burns.</p>
<p>Lauda, three times world champion, quit motor racing in 1985. He founded an airline and acts as a consultant for his former team Ferrari.</p>
