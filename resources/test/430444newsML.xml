<p>U.S. spot Group Three gasoline differentials eased a half cent late Monday in sympathy with weak Chicago prices, players said, with absolute prices further depressed by a sharp decline in NYMEX futures.</p>
<p>"Wet barrels are making their way to the Group" from Chicago, one trader said, noting that Chicago barrels had been selling in the morning for 9.0 cents below the April print -- versus 2.0 cents under for Group material.</p>
<p>That seven-cent spread narrowed by one cent by late Monday, players said, as Group traders came out shopping for the relatively cheap Chicago fuel.  </p>
<p>"You can drive a long way for six cents (a gallon), and trucks are on their wway," one player said.</p>
<p>Chicago conventional unleaded was pegged late day at 8.50 cents below the screen, edging differentially higher on the serendipitous Group buying. But Group material was talked as low as three cents below the screen.</p>
<p>Chicago gasoline diffs are expected to remain under pressure, however, amid a continued selloff of winter-grade fuel. The switch to nine-pound square inch Reid vapor pressure material from 13.5-pound winter grade is slated for the end of the month.</p>
