<p>U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross said on Wednesday he was leaving the Middle East having begun to revive Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation following a suicide attack.</p>
<p>"I am concluding this trip with the belief that we have created a mechanism that begins to establish the security relationship," he told reporters after meeting Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat at the end of a four-day mission.</p>
<p>Ross said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would "very clearly" be traveling to the region for the first time. But he did not say when.</p>
<p>Albright had said a visit -- aimed at jump-starting peace moves -- was conditional on progress in Israeli-Palestinian security coordination.</p>
<p>"The mission the president and the secretary sent me out on...was to affect the security relationship but also to prevent further deterioration, and I think that has happened at this point," said Ross, U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy.</p>
<p>Ross said he believed some of the measures which Israel had imposed on Palestinians following the suicide attack, particularly a closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip, would be eased. He did not say when this might happen.</p>
<p>Israel closed off the territories after the July 30 attack at a Jerusalem market killed 16 people, including two suicide bombers.</p>
<p>A Palestinian cabinet minister said Ross had failed in his meeting with Arafat to report any plans by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to ease sanctions on Palestinians.</p>
<p>Speaking at a PLO function after attending the meeting with Arafat and envoy Ross in the self-ruled West Bank town of Ramallah, Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said: "Ross came tonight with almost nothing from Mr Netanyahu."</p>
<p>On a visit to Jordan, the Israeli prime minister had insisted Arafat would have to crack down on militants before Israel eased sanctions. On his return home Netanyahu met Ross, who then met Arafat.</p>
<p>Ross had shuttled between Netanyahu and Arafat since Sunday, managing to bring Israeli and Palestinian security officials together to share intelligence.</p>
<p>Arafat has insisted he is making a "100 percent effort" on security and accuses Israel of using the bombing as a pretext to undermine his legitimacy.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said he was prepared to discuss with the Palestinians the fate of Jewish settlements in areas occupied by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war. The settlements are among the most contentious issues in any final peace deal.</p>
<p>"We can and we will discuss our differences, including on the issues of settlements, around the negotiating table... and hopefully come to a final settlement and end once and for all the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians," he said.</p>
<p>Jordan's King Hussein, who has questioned Netanyahu's commitment to peace, said the region was passing through dangerous times.</p>
<p>"I conveyed my concerns, he conveyed his... and we both realise the danger of the moment," the king said. Netanyahu said he had information that militants were planning more attacks.</p>
<p>Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat told reporters people should not to be too optimistic about Ross's visit.</p>
<p>"We all knew that Mr Ross came at a time when the relations between us and Israel deteriorated to levels unprecedented," he said.</p>
<p>"I think we need the dimension of a third party and I believe that Madame Albright can, if she decides to put her weight, full weight (behind it), I think she can save the process from collapsing," he said.</p>
<p>Talks on expanding Palestinian self-rule set out in a 1993 interim peace accord with Israel have been been dormant since March when Netanyahu's government allowed construction to begin on a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Israeli workers tore down nine illegal Arab homes under construction in East Jerusalem, which Palestinians hope to establish as the capital of a future state.</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it in a move that failed to win international recognition. Palestinians accuse Israel of trying to drive them out of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In Washington, Israeli Ambassador Eliahu Ben-Elissar accused Syria of preparing for war and said Israel's readiness had declined because the United States had supplied advanced arms to Egypt and other Arab states.</p>
<p>Syria was the greatest threat to Israel in the short run, he told American defence writers at a breakfast meeting.</p>
