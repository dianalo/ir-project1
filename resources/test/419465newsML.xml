<p>Southeast Asian cocoa producers opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday to explore setting up a regional trading contract to reduce dependence on foreign pacts.</p>
<p>Conference delegates said there was a long way to go before the contract, covering the seven members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), could be realised, however.</p>
<p>"We want to make an inventory of the very important factors for this contract," conference chairman Suharyo Husen of Indonesia's Agriculture Ministry told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The contract will be in the interest of all ASEAN members. We wantra-ASEAN business (in cocoa).</p>
<p>Delegates said an ASEAN contract would offer other advantages such as providing dispute-solving mechanisms within the region.</p>
<p>"The problem now is whether the contract we want to set up will gain the confidence of the international cocoa community," Siswoputranto said. "That's the key."</p>
<p>Indonesia, the world's third largest cocoa producer after the Ivory Coast and Ghana, has been forecast to produce between 319,000 and 330,000 tonnes in 1997, up 10 percent from 1996.</p>
<p>Malaysia's 1997 output is expected to remain unchanged at its 1996 level of 125,00 tonnes.</p>
