<p>France's opposition Socialist party said on Wednesday its election pledge to create 700,000 jobs was feasible without tax hikes, saying it would reform existing measures and give older workers incentives to retire early.</p>
<p>Party leader Lionel Jospin said the jobs were split into 350,000 in the public sector and "a hoped for" 350,000 in the private sector where he said "we do not have a direct responsibility."</p>
<p>The ruling centre-right coalition of Prime Minister Alain Juppe, leading the opinion polls ahead of the May 25-June 1 vote, has seized on the Socialist jobs pledge as a sign that the Socialists will return to tax and spend policies.</p>
<p>Socialist economics expert Dominique Strauss-Kahn told a news conference the 350,000 jobs in the private sector would cost businesses the equivalent of 0.5 percent of all French salaries.</p>
<p>He said that revising existing incentives for job creation would work out at between 40,000 and 50,000 francs per young person and could be chanelled to the programme.</p>
<p>Another measure would encourage firms to take on young workers by enabling employees under 60 who had paid 40 years of social security contributions to retire early. He said this could cover 200,000 people.</p>
<p>"Half a point on salaries is the effort that our country must make if it wants these 350,000 young people to get a job, he said.</p>
<p>In the public sector, he estimated the cost of the jobs as 35 billion francs a year once the programme was fully in place, compared to 135 billion francs currently given to employment aid.</p>
<p>He said the programme would take some time to get under way and the cost to the 1997 budget would be between three and five billion francs, rising to 12 billion in 1998 before the programme was fully in place in 1999.</p>
<p>"It will not be a true problem to finance it" in 1998, he said, noting that Prime Minister Alain Juppe was promising tax cuts of a similar amount for 1998.</p>
<p>"We say that rather than cutting income taxes, we want to employ 350,000 young people. Again it's a clear choice for the French people," he said. But he added there were many other ways of funding the jobs.</p>
