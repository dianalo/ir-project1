<text>
<p>AUCKLAND, Sept 20 - American heavyweight Darrell Wilson, who takes on New Zealand's David Tua at Miami tomorrow afternoon (NZT) in a make-or-break bout for both boxers, has labelled his opponent a "brawler", NZPA reports.</p>
<p>Wilson, quizzed by the American media on what he thought of the Aucklander said: "Tua just comes out brawling and he won't last the distance".</p>
<p>Tua's manager Kevin Barry jnr told NZPA the label suited his camp just fine.</p>
<p>"We're not worried, we're confident, David's done the hard work and we're happy and relaxed," Barry said.  </p>
<p>Wilson goes into the fight as one of the brightest up-and-coming boxers on the heavyweight circuit.</p>
<p>He has an impressive record of 19-0, including 12 knockouts. The result which has most boxing pundits predicting a big future for him was his third round knockout of world contender Shannon Briggs who stepped into the ring against Wilson with a 25-0 record.</p>
<p>Tua has a similar 25-0 record but has so far basically fought cardboard cutouts.</p>
<p>"This is the biggest fight of David's four-year career, he knows and he is ready for it," Barry said.  </p>
<p>"David's sparred 100 rounds for this bout, he's weighed in at 102kg, a similar weight to that when he took out the promising John Ruiz in just 19 seconds flat.</p>
<p>"He has also promised to bring out the beast for this fight and we're very confident."</p>
<p>Tua himself has been relaxed and ready for his biggest fight to date as a member of the renowned Lou Duva camp.</p>
<p>"This is the biggest fight, this is everything," Tua said.</p>
<p>"I've spent four years of my life getting to this and now it is just a matter of hours and minutes away.  </p>
<p>"I want to prove myself to all my supporters, my family and my friends who have been there for me."</p>
<p>Tua said he is in the best physical condition he has ever been in.</p>
<p>"I'm ready, I'm relaxed, and we don't have any jittery people around us because we don't need that."</p>
<p>The Tua-Wilson fight shares main billing with the world championship welterweight between his stablemate Pernell Whitaker, with whom he has often sparred with in training, and contender Wilfredo Riviera, ranked No 1 contender.</p>
