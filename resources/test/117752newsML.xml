<p>The European Commission is expected to extend rules exempting exclusive supply and distribution agreements in the beer and oil industries from fair competition rules.</p>
<p>This is due to the Commission's successive delays in adopting a consultation paper on how to deal with such sales arrangements on a long-lasting basis.</p>
<p>At issue is a so-called block exemption adopted in 1983 which exempts beer-supply arrangements, particularly between British breweries and pubs owned by them -- usually described as tied houses -- from competition rules.</p>
<p>It also allows oil companies to conclude exclusive supply accords with petrol stations for motor fuels. Lubricants and items sold in convenience shops are not covered although the oil industry would like this to be the case.</p>
<p>The Commission's competition services have proposed extending the rules by two years from the expiry date of the end of 1997, Commission sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But they warned that the final decision on the extension period and industries covered would have to be taken by the full Commission on a proposal by European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert.</p>
<p>Van Miert had not taken a position yet, but he would be making a proposal in the coming weeks, the officials said.</p>
<p>British brewers have been the most critical of the prospect of a Commission green paper on vertical restraints -- the term for exclusive supply and distributions arrangements -- which they fear could be the "last order" for Britain's tied houses.</p>
<p>The British beer market is unique in the European Union in that the vast majority of pubs are owned by powerful brewers which insist their pubs only sell their products.</p>
<p>There have been more complaints from pubs than petrol stations about the rules, Commission and industry sources said. The pubs complaining want to be allowed to sell a wider choice of beers.</p>
<p>The British government in the late 1980s relaxed brewers' grip on pub tenants by adopting legislation allowing for a guest beer.</p>
<p>But even this was questioned recently by the Commission on the grounds that it put European continental beers at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The likely extension of the block exemption is set to be welcomed by British brewers who are in disarray over the legal uncertainty created by both moves.</p>
<p>The Commission is expected to adopt its controversial green paper, or discussion paper, by the end of the year or possibly January, a Commission source said. This is more than a year later than initially due.</p>
<p>The paper, which will be submitted to a wide consulting process, is also due to address the issue of franchising covered by a separate block exemption which expires at the end of 1999.</p>
