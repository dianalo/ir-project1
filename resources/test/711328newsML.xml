<p>A unilateral ceasefire called by six leaders of the main Moslem militant group in Egypt reflects the state of weakness of the organisation and a shift in the balance between rival points of view, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>Six imprisoned leaders of the the Gama'a al-Islamiya (Islamic Group) have asked their followers to stop unilaterally their guerrilla operations and inciting statements.</p>
<p>Amin Abdul Alim, a defendant in the trial of 97 alleged Islamist militants, read out the ceasefire appeal from the leaders in court on Saturday.</p>
<p>An Islamist lawyer known for his close contacts with the militants, Muntasser el-Zayyat, confirmed the authenticity of the statement. "I confirm the statement is genuine," he said.</p>
<p>"I am optimistic that it will be observed, because those (leaders)... have spiritual weight -- they are the founding leadership of the Gama'a," added the lawyer.</p>
<p>Others, however, say the statement will not affect the status quo because the government has managed to isolate the militants and anticipate their attacks.</p>
<p>"The statement is supposed to lead to negotiations, and negotitations should be based on a balance of power," Hisham Mubarak, executive director of the Centre for Human Rights Legal Aid (CHRLA), told Reuters. "But this is not the case at present after the state has achieved great successes."</p>
<p>The Gama'a, which aims to overthrow the government and set up a strict Islamic state, has been fighting the police since 1992 in a low-level guerrilla war largely confined to southern Egypt. More than 1,000 people have been killed in the conflict.</p>
<p>The number of attacks has declined sharply since the mid-1990s, when the Gama'a was killing about one policeman a day. In Cairo militants tried to kill the prime minister, the interior minister and the information minister.</p>
<p>"I think a party in the Gama'a felt that terrorist attacks have backfired, damaging the reputation of the Gama'a, and the number of sympathisers has declined," said Hussein Amin, Egypt's former ambassador to Algeria and an Islamist writer.</p>
<p>Yasser el-Sirry, an Islamist sentenced to death in Egypt and living in exile in Britain, disagrees. "The stop in Islamic action does not mean...there is inefficiency, but may imply an amendment of strategies," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The ceasefire appeal is the latest of a series of similar calls. In February, 1996 Khaled Ibrahim called for ceasefire but Islamists dismissed it as a personal gesture.</p>
<p>It reflects a difference between two main views, which previously was not so clear, said Mubarak of CHRLA.</p>
<p>The first, adopted mainly by the founding leaders, is that conditions are not favourable for waging a long guerrilla war, while the second is for escalating military operations to destabilise the state, create chaos and then take power.</p>
<p>"With the success of attacks in the early 1990s, the second opinion had been dominant, overshadowing the other," Mubarak said. "This coincided with a state of confusion in the government...but now the Gama'a and its sister group Jihad have become fragmented, with most of their leaders either imprisoned or out of the country. There are no existing organisations any more, only fugitive cells."</p>
<p>The government has not immediately announced its position. Officials, contacted by Reuters, declined to comment.</p>
<p>Zayyat told Reuters he hoped the government would reciprocate so that no uncontrolled members of the Gama'a would break the ceasefire.</p>
<p>"I hope no security campaigns take place, otherwise elements inside the Gama'a may carry out operations as a reaction," he said. "Youngsters might come out and reject the appeal."</p>
<p>The police say they have broken the back of the military wing of the Gama'a through raids on its hideouts and steps to prevent the organisation receiving help from abroad.</p>
<p>"It would be illogical if the state responded positively to the appeal," Mubarak said. Gama'a members opposed to a ceasefire would be few in number and they do not have enough weaponry or money to make much impact, he explained.</p>
<p>"Financing states are not enthusiastic, financially or ideologically, about supporting militant groups now," Amin said.</p>
