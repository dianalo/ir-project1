<p>Willbros Group Inc said Monday one of its operating units has been awarded a contract by Great Lakes Gas Transmission LP to manage its recently announced $2.5 billion project to construct about 1,000 miles of pipeline and associated compression facilities.</p>
<p>Willbros said the value of its services is expected to be in excess of $15 million. Under Great Lakes planned filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in September 1997, Wilbros will provide project management services as well as engineering, survey, right-of-way acquisition, procurement and construction management services for the planned project.</p>
<p>The partnership is equally owned by a subsidiary of The Coastal Corporation and TransCanada PipeLines Ltd.</p>
<p>The planned 42-inch pipeline will originate at an interconnection with TransCanada PipeLines at the Minnesota-Manitoba border and will generally parallel Great Lakes' existing system to an interconnection with TransCanada near St. Clair, Mich. The project will add up to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day of additional capacity to Great Lakes' system and service is expected to begin by the winter of 1999 - 2000.</p>
