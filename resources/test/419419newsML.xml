<p>Rubber futures closed higher across the board on Tuesday on brisk shortcovering by players in the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Most of the buying was focused on RSS3 rubber, with total volume traded climbing to around 7,800 tonnes. Mild covering also took place for RSS1 rubber with the volume reaching about 1,900 tonnes, the traders said.</p>
<p>"There was a bit of buying towards the end of the session which helped buoy prices in the market. The attention was on RSS3 rubber and the action in the other rubber brands was not really that active," a trader said.  </p>
<p>Traders said the market will probably be hit by sporadic bouts of buying in the coming days.</p>
<p>"Sentiment in the market still seems a bit weak," one trader for a foreign brokerage house said. "It's sleepy."</p>
<p>At around 0945 GMT, April RSS3 was seen at 122.00-124.00 U.S. cents a kg from the previous 122.00 cents.</p>
<p>April RSS1 was seen at 173.00-175.00 Singapore cents (US$1.22-$1.23) a kg from the previous 173.00 cents.</p>
<p>May TSR20 was seen at 170.00-172.00 Singapore cents (US$1.20-$1.21) a kg from 169.50 cents.</p>
