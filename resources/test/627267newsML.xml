<p>U.S. marines are to evacuate the last four staff of the U.N. refugee agency from Sierra Leone, due to the deteriorating security situation, an agency spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>Kris Janowski, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHR), said it hoped that the U.S. marines now in Freetown could secure the evacuation by air.</p>
<p>The four staff are the last of 26 employed by the Geneva-based agency in Sierra Leone, where the elected government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was ousted in a military coup last Sunday.</p>
<p>"Everybody else is out. A decision was taken to evacuate the remaining four staff members in Sierra Leone because of the deterioration in the security situation," Janowski told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The U.N. security office in New York has asked the United States to help evacuate U.N. staff in Freetown," he added. "The Marines will secure all strategic evacuation areas in Freetown."</p>
<p>Earlier, a spokeswoman in Geneva for the U.N. World Food Programme told a news briefing that between 40 and 45 staff of U.N. agencies and non-governmental oragnisations were awaiting evacuation by boat from Sierra Leone.</p>
<p>U.S. marines using 15 helicopters evacuated Americans from the country on Friday despite orders by coup leaders there closing the country's airspace and banning all flights.</p>
