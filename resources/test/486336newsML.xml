<p>Malaysia's tin price rose five cents to 14.32 ringgit ($5.77) a kg in tandem with an overnight rise on the London Metal Exchange, and support from Japanese buyers, traders.</p>
<p>"There was not much selling pressure because of the LME and some good buying came from Japan," said a trader.</p>
<p>There were bids for 82 tonnes, against offers of 70. Final turnover was 82 tonnes against 71 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The local price was at a premium of $70 against London, from $65 on Wednesday.</p>
