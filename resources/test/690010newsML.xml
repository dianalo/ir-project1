<p>The Canadian dollar opened weaker at C$1.3960 (US$0.7163) in light trading on Thursday as foreign investors continued last night to dump Canadian assets in overseas markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the Canadian currency would continue to languish in a weak range and might break through the key technical level of C$1.3975 (US$0.7142).</p>
<p>"I think we'll break through that support easily. After that, there is nothing much stopping us from testing C$1.4000 (US$0.7142)," one trader said. "But the Bank (of Canada) will be in before then."  </p>
<p>The Bank of Canada intervened repeatedly on Thursday to buy Canada dollars as the currency weakened through key support at the C$1.3965 (US$0.7160) level.</p>
<p>"The Bank (of Canada) will be in early today if the currency starts weakening," the trader said.</p>
<p>Analysts said speculation the Bank of Canada may not raise Canadian interest rates in line with a possible U.S. Federal Reserve rate hike on July 1-2 was putting pressure on the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada's desire to adopt a more neutral monetary policy has failed to shield the Canada dollar.  </p>
<p>"There are definitely technical pressures on the currency, but there is also market impatience with the consumation of the Bank of Canada's tightening bias in terms of rate hikes," said Michael Gregory, economist and strategist with Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Gregory said markets would continue to test the central bank's resolve especially in the light of Wednesday's intervention.</p>
<p>"There's a natural tendency in the market for some players to say 'okay, fine, let's see if the bank comes in again,'" Gregory said.  </p>
<p>On the crosses, the Canada dollar dropped to 81.35 yen from Wednesday's close of 81.68 yen and rose to 1.2370 marks from Wednesday's 1.2362 marks.</p>
