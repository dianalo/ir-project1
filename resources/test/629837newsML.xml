<p>Tim Rodber became the fourth captain in as many matches when the British Lions named their side to meet Mpumalanga (formerly South Eastern Transvaal) in Witbank on Wednesday.</p>
<p>England number eight Rodber, who follows prop Jason Leonard, flanker Rob Wainwright and tour skipper Martin Johnson, leads the team three years after he was sent off playing for England in South Africa.</p>
<p>"Hopefully I will be on the field longer than I was a last time," joked Rodber.</p>
<p>"The circumstances will be very much different this time but, having said that, I will not shy away from physical contact."</p>
<p>In 1994 Rodber came on as a replacement against Eastern Province, taking the captain's armband, and was almost immediately dismissed for throwing a punch in a match in which England full-back Jonathan Callard was stamped in the face and needed stitches.</p>
<p>Tour manager Fran Cotton said: "That was three years ago and Tim is an older and wiser player and learned a lot from that. It wasn't an issue for us.</p>
<p>"We recognised that we have got quite a number of outstanding leaders in the party and the intention always was that when Martin Johnson wasn't playing to spread around the honour.</p>
<p>"It's also a step in the process of strengthening team unity."</p>
<p>With fly-half Paul Grayson returning home because of injury, Neil Jenkins -- selected for the tour as a full-back -- gets the chance to play in his more normal number 10 jersey.</p>
<p>Nick Beal, selected as a wing, fills the full-back position vacated by Jenkins.</p>
<p>The Wednesday team has already been labelled the Lions' "dirt-trackers" (reserves) in some South African quarters although the tour management again stressed they were still reviewing their options.</p>
<p>"There's no such thing as dirt-trackers on this trip," said Rodber. "It's 35 players pushing for one goal to win the test series. 'Dirt-trackers' are a thing of the past."</p>
<p>England fly-half Mike Catt will join the squad on Wednesday after being called up from his country's tour of Argentina. He will be available for selection against Northern Transvaal on Saturday.</p>
<p>British Lions team: 15-Nick Beal, 14-Ieuan Evans, 13-Allan Bateman, 12-Will Greenwood, 11-Tony Underwood, 10-Neil Jenkins, 9-Matt Dawson, 8-Tim Rodber (captain), 7-Neil Back, 6-Rob Wainwright, 5-Jeremy Davidson, 4-Doddie Weir, 3-Paul Wallace, 2-Keith Woo, 1-Tom Smith.</p>
