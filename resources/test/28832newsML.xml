<p>Enron and Portland General announced July 22 the merger proposal had been approved by directors of both companies.</p>
<p>By law, the commission has 19 days to act on the application. In order to all ow an opportunity for comment, Enron said, it waived the 19-day period and substituted December 31 for the final commission action.  </p>
<p>The company noted the application only requests approval of the Enron, Portland General combination and does not ask the commission to prejudge the industry restructuring issues that are before it.</p>
<p>The merger also requires approval from shareholders of both companies and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</p>
