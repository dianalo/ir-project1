<p>Spain held out the possibility on Tuesday of countermeasures against Cuba, including the expulsion of its ambassador in Madrid, if actions against Spanish interests continued, a senior Spanish official told Reuters.</p>
<p>"We don't rule out any type of measures, positive or negative," the official, who did not want to be named, said.</p>
<p>The comment followed reports, which the Foreign Ministry confirmed on Tuesday, of incidents at the Spanish consul's house in Havana.</p>
<p>Vandals punctured the tyres of consul Eduardo Cerro's car and stole a television antenna from his house on Monday night, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. No further details were immediately available.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources in Havana said burglars had stolen a television antenna from outside the consul's home last week while he was away on a trip.</p>
<p>The incidents followed Cuba's withdrawal last week of its earlier approval for a new Spanish ambassador to Havana.</p>
<p>Relations between Spain and Cuba have deteriorated to their lowest point in years after Havana accused Madrid of meddling in its affairs by urging the European Union to adopt a tougher policy towards Cuba in a push for democratic reforms in the communist state.</p>
<p>Havana cancelled a planned Spanish book exhibit and conference in Cuba last week, according to the official, who said the Spanish government was not ruling out countermeasures including the ambassador's explusion.</p>
<p>"We can name a new ambassador (to Cuba) or not. We can have this woman here or not," said the official, referring to Cuba's ambassador to Spain, Rosario Navas.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry officials said on Monday Spain might take several months to name a replacement ambassador to Cuba, and would only do so after Havana indicated that it would approve the new candidate.</p>
<p>The incident at the consul's residence came days after Spain asked Cuba to protect its embassy for fear of attacks.</p>
<p>Cuban authorities placed a security cordon around the embassy, posting hundreds of police and plain-clothes guards outside to head off any disturbances.</p>
<p>The new Spanish government of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar has adopted a much tougher line in pressing for democratic reform in Cuba than its Socialist predecessor.</p>
