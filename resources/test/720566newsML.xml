<p>The European Commission said on Thursday it was confident that U.S. aircraft giant Boeing would come up with adequate changes to its planned $14 billion merger with McDonnell Douglas to meet EU concerns.</p>
<p>The spokesman of European Union Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said it was up to Boeing to offer remedies but made clear that the EU executive was seeking "structural" changes.</p>
<p>"We remain confident that Boeing will offer adequate remedies regarding the main competition concerns identified by the Commission," spokesman Willy Helin told reporters.</p>
<p>"We don't believe that any of the offers they could make, contrary to what has been said in the United States, jeopardises their situation."</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) unconditionally cleared the merger last week. In contrast, Van Miert has said it cannot be approved without concessions. The 20-member Commission is expected to vote on the deal on July 23, leaving only two more weeks for solving the sensitive issue.</p>
<p>The Commission has the power to vet corporate deals where the firms involved have a combined worldwide turnover of at least five billion European currency units ($5.61 billion) and the EU turnover of each firm amounts to 250 million Ecus.</p>
<p>If the Commission finds that a merger creates or strengthens a dominant position on the market, it can demand changes, or even block it.</p>
<p>Helin was reacting to reported comments by William Baer, an official at the FTC, about a supposed Commission demand that the merger partners sell Douglas Aircraft, McDonnell Douglas' commercial aircraft unit in Long Beach, California.</p>
<p>"The issue raised by director William Baer is but one of the main concerns expressed by the European Commission," he said, reading a prepared statement. But, he added, "it is not in the European Commission's role to identify potential remedies."</p>
<p>Asked whether Boeing must offer structural remedies, or whether a commitment not to exploit its position on the market could be sufficient, Helin said: "All offers that are being made in a merger case as regards concerns raised by the Commission must be of a structural nature."</p>
<p>A Boeing executive told Reuters on Wednesday that the Commission had made no demands on Boeing to sell Douglas Aircraft. "We know there is an area of concern which is the size of the in-service fleet (of McDonnell Douglas). We are working on remedies to address those concerns," the executive said.</p>
<p>The European Commission argues that the merger would add to Boeing's already dominant position in the aircraft industry.</p>
<p>Its figures say the deal would give the merged firms a 70 percent share of the market for large civil aircraft -- those with more than 100 seats. This compares with 30 percent for its rival Airbus, a four-nation European consortium.</p>
<p>Among its other concerns, it opposes Boeing's exclusive contracts to supply aircraft to airlines such as Delta, American and Continental. It also worries about the possibility of spillovers of public money, earmarked for research and development in defence, into Boeing's civil aviation business.</p>
<p>In Washington on Wednesday sources said the U.S. Justice Department's top antitrust official, Joel Klein, would travel to Brussels in the next few days to discuss the merger.</p>
