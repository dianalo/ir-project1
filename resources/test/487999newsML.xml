<p>Knight-Ridder Inc. said Friday it agreed to buy the Kansas City Star and three other daily newspapers owned by ABC Inc., a division of Walt Disney Co., for $1.65 billion.</p>
<p>It also said it was going to divest Knight-Ridder Information Inc., its on-line information service for business and professional users, which includes Dialogue and DataStar.</p>
<p>The ABC newspapers include The Kansas City Star, the Fort Worth and Arlington Star-Telegrams, the Belleville (Ill.) News-Democrat and The Times Leader in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., it said. Revenue for the group was $500 million in 1996, it said.</p>
<p>"The company anticipates completing the sale during 1997," it said. "The transactions will enable Knight-Ridder to focus on its core newspaper business, which is the foundation of the company.</p>
<p>The proposed transactions will result in about 10 percent dilution of earnings during the first 12 months, minimal dilution during the second year and will result in earnings gains during the third year, Knight-Ridder said.</p>
<p>Knight-Ridder, whose flagship papers are the Miami Herald and the Philadelphia Inquirer, said it would finance the deal by issuing $660 million in convertible preferred stock and assuming $990 million of pre-existing debt.</p>
<p>It also said it planned to buy back at least 15 million common shares during the next 12 months.</p>
<p>Knight-Ridder is an international communications company engaged in newspaper publishing, business news and information services, among other things.</p>
<p>Knight-Ridder said the the deal should close within 60 days.</p>
