<p>Chile international Sebastian Rozental flew to California on Monday for surgery on a knee injury which has restricted him to just 58 minutes of football since he signed for Scottish premier league leaders Glasgow Rangers in a deal worth four million pounds ($6.6 million).</p>
<p>Rozental, who wrenched his left knee in a game against St Johnstone in a Scottish Cup match in late January, will undergo surgery in Sherman Oaks, California, on Wednesday or Thursday. He is then due to spend about 12 days recovering in Los Angeles before flying back to Glasgow.</p>
