<p>Abuse of monopoly power could be curbed by the risk of treble damages for breaches of the Commerce Act, Clear Communications chief executive Andrew Makin said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Speaking at the Wellington Chamber of Commerce, Makin said the existing regulatory environment was not capable of achieving full competition in telecommunications unless it was adjusted.</p>
<p>"At the moment, light-handed regulation is simply another name for no regulation," he said.  </p>
<p>Makin said the telecommunications industry did not need a regulator and government intervention did not need to be highly prescriptive. However, the government had a responsibility to provide an appropriate framework.</p>
<p>"And the framework in New Zealand at the moment is not appropriate -- if the recent experience hasn't taught us that, then it hasn't taught us anything," he said.</p>
<p>Specifically, Makin said, revisions to New Zealand's current regulatory model in the telecommunications industry required an effective statement of the legal principles on which interconnection was to be sought and given.  </p>
<p>Makin said the resolution last year of Clear's long-standing dispute with Telecom over local service interconnection did not imply New Zealand's light-handed regulation was working.</p>
<p>He said compensatory damages for breaches of section 36 of the Commerce Act, which deals with monopolist abuse of a dominant position, did not go far enough.</p>
<p>Private plaintiffs and the Commerce Commission were unlikely to have the resources to challenge a violation once it was detected, he said.  </p>
<p>Makin noted the observation of an American antitrust commentator that not all violations were detected, so single damages rules made violations profitable.</p>
<p>"Therefore, treble damages, which are not a peculiarly American phenomenon, but which date from the English Statute of Monopolies in 1623, would be a useful tool in New Zealand competition law," Makin said.</p>
<p>He added that the introduction of treble damages could have positive ramifications beyond competition law.  </p>
<p>"Treble damages, by making companies and directors more accountable and hence more likely to consider the legality of proposed actions, would be one mechanism that could help create a more professional and sophisticated environment in New Zealand similar to comparable countries," he said.</p>
<p>Makin said the barriers to effective competition were greater in New Zealand than in the U.S., due to the small size of the economy and New Zealand's geographic isolation.</p>
