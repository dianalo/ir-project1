<p>Shares in LASMO Plc were indicated higher on Thursday after the British oil exploration company said it nearly doubled its profits in 1996.</p>
<p>The shares were up 6-1/2p to 245-1/2p in pre-market dealings at 0811 GMT.  </p>
<p>LASMO posted profits of 67 million stg, helped by the unexpected strength of oil prices and internal cost controls</p>
<p>Dealers said the share price was also buoyed by the company's statement that reserve additions would more than replace 1997 production.</p>
<p>Shares in other oil exploration companies were flat to narrowly mixed. --London newsroom +44 171 542 5106</p>
