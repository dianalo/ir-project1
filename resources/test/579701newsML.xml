<p>Lagardere's five billion franc ($868.5 million) convertible bond issue, part of its financing of its bid in the privatisation of Thomson-CSF has been fully placed with investors, broker Cholet-Dupont said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Cholet-Dupont was confirming information obtained from several fund managers which showed that the issue was fully subscribed on Friday, two days after it was announced.</p>
<p>British Aerospace took 1.5 billion francs -- as planned, institutional investors in Britain subscribed to 800 million francs, Swiss investors took about 100 million and other European institutionals subscribed to another 100 million.</p>
<p>French insurance companies and retirement funds subscribed to the remaining 2.5 billion francs.</p>
<p>On May 7, British Aerospace said it was putting up 300 million stg ($486.4 million) to support Lagardere's bid.</p>
<p>About 30 investors subscribed to the issue, the sources said.</p>
<p>Since the bonds will be issued only if Lagardere's wins the right to buy the government's 58-percent stake in Thomson-CSF, the subscriptions were made in the form of irrevocable promises to subscribe if Lagardere succeeds, the sources said.</p>
<p>The bonds carry rights to convert to Thomson-CSF stock priced of 165 francs per share.</p>
<p>The bonds will be issued on the day Lagardere is officially designated as the winning bidder, over rival Alcatel Alsthom, which is mounting a joint bid with Dassault Industries.</p>
<p>The government has said it will make its decision after the two-round parliamentary election, set for May 25 and June 1, and before June 30.</p>
<p>The one year bonds will be issued on the eurofranc market and will be repayable in Thomson-CSF shares or cash, depending on the conditions of the planned merger of Matra Hautes Technologies with Thomson-CSF. That merger will follow acquisition of the government's controlling interest.</p>
<p>The yield on the bonds will be PIBOR plus 50 basis points.</p>
