<p>German drugs wholesaler Andreae-Noris Zahn AG (Anzag) said on Wednesday that its sales for the first half of the 1996/97 finanical year had fallen to 2.096 billion marks ($1.2 billion) from 2.139 billion previously.</p>
<p>But the firm said its first-half income from ordinary activitiies was up 14.2 percent, at 39.0 million marks.</p>
<p>Anazag said that for the whole of the current financial year, which runs from September 1996 to August 1997, it expected total sales to fall by 1.5 percent compared with the previous year, to 4.25 billion marks.  </p>
<p>"Our sales development is heavily influenced by political decisions," Anzag's chief executive Hermann Franke said in a statement. "Our business can only react to these decisions."</p>
<p>He said the firm had altered its cost structure in 1996, and said that the first half results showed that this alteration was correct.</p>
<p>Franke added said that despite what he termed a "difficult" business year, the firm still expected to offer an attractive dividend to shareholders.</p>
<p>Anzag said measures taken in May 1996 to adjust the shareholding structure of the firm and streamline operations had led to a substantial decline in operating expenditure, falling by 5.9 million marks to 151.6 million marks.</p>
