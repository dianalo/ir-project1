<text>
<p>Hundreds of Chinese police on Friday forcibly dispersed protesters staging a sit-in outside the headquarters of the Communist Party and government.  </p>
<p>Each protester was grabbed by two police and forced aboard a bus as visiting dignitaries emerged in limousines from the tightly-guarded Zhongnanhai government compound in the heart of Beijing.</p>
<p>One elderly man tried to get off the bus but was pushed back by police.</p>
<p>A few protesters walked away to avoid being loaded onto the buses. One shouted: "I have no home to go to." "What crime have we, the people, committed?" another cried.</p>
<p>Police ordered local residents to return to their homes and urged curious onlookers to disperse.</p>
