<p>Imperial Chemical  Industries Plc said on Thursday industrial chemical prices had reached the bottom of the economic cycle.</p>
<p>"There is evidence that prices in a number of industrial chemicals went through the bottom of the pendulum swing in the second quarter," chief financial officer Alan Spall told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>He said titanium dioxide prices showed some evidence of hardening, while in chlorine, which is the main feedstock for PVC, prices "are moving up, but somewhat slowly".</p>
<p>Spall said there were signs of stabilisation in acrylics and polyurethanes, after a subdued first half.</p>
