<p>President Clinton's budget director Wednesday urged Congress to approve $700 million in additional funding for the Superfund program, saying the funds were needed to continue environmental cleanup efforts.</p>
<p>Office of Management and Budget Director Franklin Raines said the funding was agreed in the balanced budget deal between Congress and the White House, and the accord did not make the funds contingent on a comprehensive reform of the program.</p>
<p>The government has spent $14 billion and companies have spent $12 billion to begin getting rid of waste at 1,300 of the nation's worst toxic waste sites since the Superfund legislation was passed in 1980.</p>
<p>Raines said the administration understood the balanced budget agreement to mean that the additional Superfund spending would be authorized if the two sides could work out how the extra funds would be spent.</p>
<p>"We do not agree that the additional Superfund cleanup funding agreed to the budget agreement is contingent on any prior legislation, much less a comprehensive reform bill," Raines wrote in a letter to Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and ranking member of the Commerce Committee.</p>
<p>Raines said the administration remained committed to working with Congress to enact "a bipartisan, consensus-based Superfund reform bill" but did not want to see these efforts delay approval of the Superfund spending.</p>
<p>The money was urgently needed to "eliminate the backlog of Superfund cleanups and improve the quality of life for more than 27 million Americans, including over four million children, who live within four miles of a Superfund site," Raines wrote.</p>
<p>Raines also said a reserve fund of $200 million per year for Superfund orphan shares agreed to in the budget deal should not be held hostage to a comprehensive reform bill.</p>
