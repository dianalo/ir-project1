<p>About $4.4 billion, or one-fourth of the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income workers claimed for 1994, was erroneous, an Internal Revenue Service report said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The study found that taxpayers erroneously claimed approximately $4.4 billion of EITC, which was 25.8 percent of the total EITC claimed," IRS Commissioner Margaret Richardson wrote in a letter to Rep. Nancy Johnson, a Connecticut Republican.</p>
<p>The study was based on a sample of 1994 returns claiming the tax credit and accepted by the IRS in the first four months of 1995.</p>
<p>Richardson called the noncompliance rate "unacceptably high" but said the study indicated "significant improvement" since the late 1980s.</p>
<p>House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, a Texas Republican, said he intended to hold a hearing on the report.</p>
<p>"Today's revelation is extremely troubling," Archer said in a statement. "Despite the government's best efforts, EITC fraud is shockingly high, making it one of the most abused programs on the books," he said.</p>
