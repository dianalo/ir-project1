<text>
<p>Turkey's state oil company Tupras has re-issued a tender to buy high sulphur cracked fuel oil, traders said.</p>
<p>The new tender calls for 25-50,000 tonnes of fuel oil with a maximum sulphur content of 3.5 percent, specific gravity of 0.975, to be delivered between November 11 and 15.</p>
<p>Bids into the tender, which closes on Thursday, are to be based on published 3.5 percent sulphur quotes.</p>
<p>The original tender was for the same quantity of fuel oil with the same delivery period, but required bids based on one percent sulphur quotes, with specific gravity 0.1. Tupras officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Traders said a parallel tender for 55-60,000 tonnes of low sulphur fuel oil had not been altered. -- Nicholas Shaxson, London newsroom +44 171 542 8167</p>
