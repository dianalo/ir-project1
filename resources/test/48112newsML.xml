<p>China's propaganda tsars have suspended a magazine and banned articles by a leading bankruptcy expert after a lengthy behind-doors debate on economic reform erupted into the public eye, Chinese sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The ban prompted an open letter by a writer in Beijing questioning whether China's propaganda officials were opposed to economic reform and whether they backed the leadership of state president and Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin.</p>
<p>The Press and Publications Administration, under the party's powerful Propaganda Department, suspended publication of the Economic Work Monthly, based in southwestern Guizhou province, in August, said sources familiar with the magazine.</p>
<p>The suspension followed the magazine's publication of an article critical of a privately circulated tract known as the "10,000-word essay" which urges a return to class struggle and warns of the erosion of the state sector by private enterprise.</p>
<p>This was the first public disclosure in China of the essay penned by supporters of a more orthodox Marxist line.</p>
<p>Western diplomats and Chinese analysts have described a literary and cultural freeze in recent months amid a crackdown by propaganda tsars on publications and authors that dare to break away from a stultifying diet of state-approved fare.</p>
<p>The president of the outspoken Beijing Youth Daily is to be replaced soon by a more conservative editor.</p>
<p>The clampdown has been fuelled by a call for "spiritual civilisation" -- a communist watchword for orthodox Marxist values -- as the theme for a party plenum scheduled for later this month, the analysts said.</p>
<p>Suspension of the Economic Work Monthly came after the Press and Publications Administration issued an internal notice on August 9 banning newspapers and magazines from reprinting two articles on economic reform by prominent economist Cao Siyuan that were carried in the magazine's July edition, the sources said.</p>
<p>The notice said Cao's articles "violated propaganda discipline" and contained "serious political problems", said a source who saw the circular.</p>
<p>The notice did not elaborate on the political problems in the articles by Cao, who drafted China's bankruptcy law in the mid-1980s, said the source, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>Cao's daring articles focused on criticism of the essay doubting the merits of reform and believed to have been produced by the office of Deng Liqun, a retired propaganda tsar and former secretary to late Chairman Mao Zedong.</p>
<p>The essay, titled "Factors Affecting Our Country's National Security" has circulated privately in official and intellectual circles since last year and has sparked widespread debate between those advocating market reforms and conservative defenders of public ownership and central planning.</p>
