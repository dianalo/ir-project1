<title>NEW ZEALAND: AMP Investments NZ to float World Index Fund.</title>
<headline>AMP Investments NZ to float World Index Fund.</headline>

<p>AMP Investments NZ Ltd said on Tuesday it would become the first company to offer passive investment in world share markets through the New Zealand Stock Exchange, when it launches its World Index Fund (WiNZ).</p>
<p>"The fund provides an opportunity for investment in many of the world's leading companies through the purchase of a single security," AMP Investments Managing Director Roger Greville said in statement.</p>
<p>"The fund offers investors a simple, single currency method of international passive investment. Differing time zones and lack of information make the argument for passive investment more compelling the further away an investor is operating from his or her home market."</p>
<p>Greville said WiNZ also gave investors an increased opportunity to spread share investment risk.</p>
<p>"It will cover a larger and more diversified portfolio than could be obtained in any one market, particularly the New Zealand market," he said.</p>
<p>WiNZ will track the performance of companies in the United States, Britain, Germany, Japan, Canada and Australia, using an adaptation of the Morgan Stanley Capital International Index.</p>
<p>The initial offer period for WiNZ runs from July 8 to 25, and the fund is expected to list on or before August 6.</p>
<p>The minimum investment is NZ$5,000, AMP said.</p>
