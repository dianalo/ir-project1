<p>The U.S. economy looks to have ended 1996 on a strong note and the Federal Reserve needs to watch out for signs of rising price pressures, Richmond Fed President Alfred Broaddus said on Monday.</p>
<p>He told a conference sponsored by Johnson and Higgins insurance company that the risks to the economy were titled "somewhat to the upside."  </p>
<p>"The economy ended 1996 on a quite strong note," Broaddus said. "With the economy already operating at a high level, we will obviously need to watch these developments closely for any signs of rising underlying inflation pressures," he added.</p>
<p>Much of Broaddus's speech echoed remarks he made earlier this month.</p>
<p>He steered clear of giving his own economic forecast for 1997, although he did say that the "consensus" forecast of private economists seemed "reasonable." That forecast, held by the vast majority of private economists, forsees trend growth this year of two to 2-1/2 percent and steady inflation.  </p>
<p>"There are risks in the outlook, both on the upside and the downside," Broaddus said. "My own view ... is that they are tilted somewhat to the upside."</p>
<p>On the downside, the risk is that heavily-indebted consumers will cut back on their spending, either voluntarily or involuntarily. Broaddus saw some signs that banks and other lenders are already beginning to be a "little more careful at the margin" about lending money to consumers.</p>
<p>But he made clear he was more concerned about the upside risks to the economy. "We need to watch this carefully," he said. "The one thing we do not want is a boom-bust cycle."  </p>
<p>Broaddus said that many markets are tight, but that the labor market is "exceptionally" so.</p>
<p>He said that the U.S. central bank cannot afford to be satisfied with holding inflation steady and instead needed to shoot for price stability. "Three percent inflation is not good enough," he said. "We need to go for all the marbles."</p>
<p>Given that the consumer price index (CPI) is widely believed to overstate inflation, that means trying to lower the CPI to two percent and below, Broaddus said.</p>
<p>"We need gradually to move the CPI down toward two percent and ultimately lower than that and hold it there," he said.</p>
<p>The consumer price index rose 3.3 percent last year. After stripping out volatile food and energy costs, the increase was 2.6 percent.</p>
