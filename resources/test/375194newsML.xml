<p>Poland's biggest Plock refinery said on Thursday it would raise prices on all types of fuel it produced, but the precise scope of the increase would be announced on Friday.</p>
<p>The refinery's move follows the finance ministry's decision earlier on Thursday to free all fuel prices and abolish administrative limits on distributors' margins. Earlier the country's second biggest refinery in Gdansk announced it would raise prices on Friday by between five and 8.5 percent.</p>
<p>"The Plock refinery will now certainly raise its prices on all kinds of fuel, but the size of the increase will be announced in a statement tomorrow, because we are now analysing the situation," a Plock spokeswoman Romana Kufel said.</p>
<p>As a result of the administrative controls Polish refineries suffered reduced profits because they could not offset the rising world crude prices by increasing domestic market prices.</p>
<p>The net profit of Plock, Poland's biggest refinery, halved in 1996 to about 230 million zlotys.</p>
