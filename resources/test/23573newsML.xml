<p>The closely-held Czech bank Pragobanka a.s. on Friday said a annual general meeting of shareholders agreed to raise basic equity through a 500 million crown rights issue priced at a 200 percent premium.</p>
<p>In a statement, bank spokesman Dusan Michelfeit said the premium would raise another one billion crowns, and the new shares would not be publicly traded.  </p>
<p>The bank, which is majority-owned by the largest Czech insurer Ceska Pojistovna a.s. , has current basic capital of 1.36 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The bank posted a gross 1995 profit before provisions of 406 million crowns which was all ploughed into reserves. Further additions to reserves accounted created a net loss of 868 million crowns for the year.</p>
<p>Michelfeit said shareholders agreed to cover the loss to reserves from the money gained from the premium on the new share issues, plus premiums gained from previous rights issues.</p>
<p>He said the AGM also agreed to add two representatives of Pojistovna to the bank's current five member management board.</p>
