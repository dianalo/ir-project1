<p>Hollywood Casino Corp on Thursday said increased competition, particularly in Atlantic City, hurt third quarter earnings.</p>
<p>The company reported a net loss of $8.4 million, or $0.34 per share, for its third quarter compared with net income of $7.1 million, or $0.29 per share, for the same period of the prior year.</p>
<p>"An unprecedented market share war continues to rage in Atlantic City," Edward T. Pratt III, Hollywood's president and chief operating officer, said in a statement.</p>
<p>He continued, "the industry's rate of spending on marketing programs far exceeds the rate of real casino growth. As a result, pressure on revenues and operating margins continues to be intense."</p>
<p>"Additionally, increases in casino capacity in both the Chicago and Tunica markets put pressure on margins at our two Hollywood Casino properties during the quarter," he said.</p>
