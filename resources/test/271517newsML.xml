<p>There could hardly be a wider gulf in managerial image between Stuart Pearce and Arsene Wenger, but the pair neatly illustrate the increasingly split personality of modern English soccer.</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon summed it all up perfectly. Wenger, the cultured Frenchman who has removed the blinkers from Arsenal this season, versus Nottingham Forest's Pearce, a stereotypical English defender with a passion for punk rock and a dislike of talking to the media.</p>
<p>The result was a 2-1 win for bottom-of-the-table Forest, although the fact a Norwegian scored both home goals made it a slightly less emphatic victory for bulldog spirit over continental sophistication.</p>
<p>Still, it represented a special moment for Pearce, appointed caretaker player-manager following the midweek resignation of Frank Clark despite his continued involvement in England's World Cup qualifying squad.</p>
<p>Known to his team-mates as "Psycho" for his uncompromising approach to the game, Pearce cheerfully admitted he could have ended his first game in charge as the butt of a thousand jokes.</p>
<p>When he sat down to select his first Forest team, the 34-year-old became so wrapped up in tactical planning he overlooked one crucial detail.</p>
<p>"When I wrote down the players I wanted, I found I had 12 names on the sheet," he joked. "You could tell I was new to management."</p>
<p>His final pre-match instructions to his players were scarcely of the Churchillian variety -- "Don't mess me about" -- and he has already been exposed to the hidden demands of the job.</p>
<p>"The last 24 hours has been pretty strange. To be honest, I enjoyed being on the pitch because no-one can hassle you or ring you there."</p>
<p>Such a homegrown philosophy is light years removed from Wenger's more studious approach, famous for inspiring England manager Glenn Hoddle when he was a player at Monaco.</p>
<p>But though Arsenal remain in second place in the table, the new poise of their football has ironically coincided with an increasing amount of trouble with referees.</p>
<p>Steve Bould and Tony Adams both received red cards in the space of four days last month, and Ian Wright's dismissal on Saturday added to the roll of dishonour.</p>
<p>Wenger suggested it was simply coincidence and said he had not seen the Wright incident.</p>
<p>"I can't give an opinion because I didn't see what happened, but having him sent off made it more difficult for us.</p>
<p>"We already had problems and, of course, it makes a difference when you're down to 10 men."</p>
<p>What has undoubtedly made the biggest difference to English soccer, however, has been the influx of overseas talent.</p>
<p>Saturday's premier league games featured goals from two Norwegians, a Frenchman, a Dane, an Italian and a Portuguese, not to mention Welsh and Northern Irish internationals Mark Hughes and Jim Magilton.</p>
<p>Chelsea fans, in particular, left Stamford Bridge raving about a goal from Gianfranco Zola in their 3-1 win over West Ham which reinforced Ruud Gullit's decision to sign him from Parma for 4.5 million pounds ($7.5 million) last month.</p>
<p>Zola totally confused West Ham captain Julian Dicks with a dazzling solo 10th minute effort, and Gullit was quick to congratulate him.</p>
<p>"Franco has stolen the hearts of the fans with the way he plays. He's given us something extra and I'm very happy for him."</p>
<p>If Zola imagines he can copy the majority of Europe's footballers and put his feet up over Christmas, however, he will be sadly disappointed.</p>
<p>The festive season is as packed with fixtures as ever and is often a time when traditional English stamina triumphs over continental skill. The challenge for Zola and company is to keep decorating the English game once the turkey and mince pies have disappeared.</p>
