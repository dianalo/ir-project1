<p>Strong sterling kept a squeeze on the Bradford tops market, trade sources reported on Moday.</p>
<p>Aided by resistance from retail buyers, the pound pinned prices down at low levels and most were unchanged in cautious trade, they said.</p>
<p>"Continental customers are seeing UK suppliers as expensive because of sterling, and they're calling in deliveries from alternative sources like South America as a short-term expedient," one said.</p>
<p>Easing in primary market prices, notably Australia which saw the indicator fall seven cents, contributed to the depressed tone.</p>
<p>Textile processors continue to report extremely tight margins and cite hard bargaining by retail customers as the main reason.</p>
<p>Business has been brighter for topmakers taking commission work and this sector has seen a steady flow-through of orders, industry sources said.</p>
<p>With few signs that tops suppliers in either carpet or clothing have been able to share in the established domestic recovery in retail prices and consumer demand, no-one can predict when a steady upturn in tops prices will begin, they said.</p>
