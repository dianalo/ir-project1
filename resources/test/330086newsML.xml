<p>Albanian demonstrators set fire to the town hall and ransacked a cinema in the southern city of Lushnje in protest at the loss of their savings in collapsed pyramid schemes, state radio said on Friday.</p>
<p>"Thousands of people gathered in front of the town hall. The people were angry and out of control and they set fire to the town hall," the radio said.  </p>
<p>"They have started to destroy the cinema," the radio added.</p>
<p>Albanian President Sali Berisha told the radio after a cabinet meeting devoted to the protests that he understood the indignation of hundreds of thousands of people who had poured their life savings into pyramid schemes.</p>
<p>"They have suffered real misfortune and the government will do everything it can to ease their burden," he said.</p>
<p>Berisha accused opposition parties of trying to exploit the situation. Thousands of Albanians have taken to the streets over the past week, blaming the government for the collapse of the pyramid schemes.</p>
