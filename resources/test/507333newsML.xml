<p>Healthdyne Technologies Inc chairman Parker Petit said he will ask the company's board to set an annual shareholders meeting for late July.</p>
<p>Hostile bidder Invacare is seeking a court order to force the meeting by June 30, but Healthdyne said it wants shareholders to consider the company's second quarter results before they vote on Invacare's $173 million offer.</p>
<p>Healthdyne also said it will ask a court to rule on the validity of one of Invacare's proposals to be considered at the 1997 annual meeting.  </p>
<p>The proposal would amend Healthdyne's by-laws to require that the board remove the continuing directors provisions from its shareholder rights plan.</p>
<p>Healthdyne is urging shareholders to reject Invacare's offer, saying a sale of the company is not in their best interests at this time.</p>
<p>The Healthdyne board will consider a timetable for the annual meeting at its regularly-scheduled session this week.</p>
<p>Healthdyne also said new product introductions are on schedule, adding that its strategic plan will result in higher near-term value to shareholders than Invacare's offer.</p>
