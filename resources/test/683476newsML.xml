<p>Shares of Central Fidelity Banks Inc rallied in morning trade Tuesday after it announced a proposed $2.3 billion acquisition by Wachovia Corp.</p>
<p>Analysts and arbitrageurs said the proposed deal fits well with Wachovia's expansion strategy in the Southeast.</p>
<p>"Wachovia is really building itself into a super-regional. This is how you build a major franchise," said Steve Cohen, head of research at Kellner, DiLeo &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Central Fidelity stock jumped 5-15/16 to 37-13/16. Wachovia shares slipped 15/16 to 61-11/16.  </p>
<p>The transaction marks Wachovia's second transaction this month after a six-year hiatus from acquisitions. On June 10, the North Carolina bank announced plans to buy Jefferson Bankshares Inc for $542 million.</p>
<p>Although both acquisition targets are based in Virginia, experts said little overlap was expected. Wachovia, which operates primarily in North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia, had previously expressed interest in the Virginia market.</p>
<p>"They're picking up another very large, very good state. It's the largest bank in Virgina and it doesn't have a lot of problems," said John Mason of Interstate/Johnson Lane.</p>
<p>Wachovia also has mentioned Maryland as an attractive area for future acquisitions.</p>
