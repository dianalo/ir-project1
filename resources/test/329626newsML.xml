<p>A minor cabinet reshuffle combined with plans to spend more money on public services has signalled the end of Sweden's two-year programme of fiscal toughness, analysts say.</p>
<p>Swedish debt yields opened higher on Thursday and the crown weakened against the dollar and the mark as markets digested and analysed Persson's apparent U-turn.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Goran Persson, who as finance minister launched a major fiscal clean-up plan in 1994, has pledged to spend 10 billion crowns in 1998 on improving public services.</p>
<p>"Debt yields are rising...because of what Goran Persson said yesterday that the budget surplus in 1998 of 10 billion crowns will be spent on welfare," one dealer said.</p>
<p>"Goran Persson is gearing up his troops and preparing for the next election," the left-leaning daily Dagens Nyheter said in an editorial on Thursday.</p>
<p>The first signs that Persson was weakening on an economic policy that has won the respect of international financial markets came with an apparently innocuous cabinet reshuffle on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But political insiders pointed out that the appointment of Defence Minister Thage Peterson to work as a point man in Persson's cabinet was key.</p>
<p>Peterson's first words on his appointment signalled that the minority government, elected in September 1994, was changing tack before the next election due in September next year.</p>
<p>"We have agreed on many painful cutbacks that have been rough on many people. An important goal is to win the general elections in 1998."</p>
<p>Peterson is a faithful member of the ruling Social Democratic Party (SDP) which has only begrudgingly approved of Persson's spending cuts, which have been aimed at reining in ballooning debt and a growing budget deficit.</p>
<p>In parliament on Wednesday Persson reinforced the cabinet reshuffle by signalling clearly that he would be making large-scale giveaways in election year to Swedes hardest hit by two years of public spending cuts.</p>
<p>"Tuesday's reshuffle and the parliamentary speech are part of an offensive ahead of an election that could be tough," Dagens Nyheter added.</p>
<p>Delaying plans to use a budget surplus in 1998 to pay off massive state debt, Persson said the 10 billion crown surplus forecast for 1998 would be used for social services.</p>
<p>"After two exhausting years when the government has been exposed to scorn and derision, we can now promise improvements in the welfare system," he told parliament.</p>
<p>"For 1998, we will have a balanced budget, but we will also have some room on top of that. There will be a surplus of about 10 billion crowns, which will be used to strengthen health care, care for the elderly and children and schools."</p>
<p>Some commentators slammed the Persson announcement as blatant electioneering.</p>
<p>"The prime minister is now preparing himself for the homecoming of conservative leader Carl Bildt. By committing money to emotive areas like health care, the elderly and education he is hoping to split the opposition," commentator Jorgen Eklund wrote in the business daily Finanstidningen.</p>
<p>Bildt, leader of the Conservative Party, is due to return to Sweden later this year to resume his duties after two years as an international mediator in Bosnia.</p>
