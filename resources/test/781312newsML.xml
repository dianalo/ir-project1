<p>South African quarrying firm Minaco Granite &amp; Marble Ltd said on Wedneday it had agreed to buy 33 percent of Natural Stone Processors (Pty) Ltd (NSP) for six million rand from the North West Development Corporation Ltd.</p>
<p>Minaco will also buy 33 percent of shareholders claims against NSP and both deals are with effect from January 1, 1997.</p>
<p>The price will be settled by the issue of 15 million new Minaco shares at a price of 40 cents per Minaco share.</p>
<p>NSP operates a granite processing beneficiation plant producing granite slabs.</p>
<p>The financial effects of the acquisition assuming the deal was effective for the year ended December 1996 would be to raise earnings per share before exceptional items to 227 cents from 109 cents.</p>
<p>It said an agreement to acquire 33 percent of NSP from Matsushita Sangyo Company Ltd and Mitsubishi Shoij Construction Materials Corporation on similar terms was being finalised.</p>
<p>The other 33 percent is held by Marlin Corporation Ltd (Marcorp) and as part of Marcorp's restructuring Minarco will acquire the NSP stake.</p>
