<p>Italy on Monday handed over five crates of personal belongings, recently uncovered in a Treasury vault, to the Jewish communities they were plundered from by Nazi forces during World War Two.</p>
<p>Among the valuables were pocket watches, coins, jewels, family silver, necklaces, bracelets, cutlery, toys, precious stones and some gold false teeth.</p>
<p>"These crates don't contain a treasure, at least not in the traditional meaning of the word," Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said at the official handing-over ceremony.</p>
<p>"Rather they contain a treasure of memories and suffering," he added.</p>
<p>The belongings were stolen from Jews in and around the city of Trieste in northeastern Italy.</p>
<p>Trieste was under Nazi occupation from September 1943 until the end of the war in 1945 and many of the city's Jews died in nearby San Sabba, the only German Nazi death camp in Italy.</p>
<p>"These goods do not really have a commercial value, but rather a sentimental value," Tullia Zevi, president of the Italian Jewish community, told reporters.</p>
<p>"But this ceremony has a symbolic value and acts as a warning and an invitation to other European countries to likewise search out and return property to those who lost it," she added.</p>
<p>Italy's move to hand back the belongings comes at a time when its neighbour Switzerland faces growing charges that its banks have hoarded the wealth of Holocaust victims and laundered looted Nazi gold.</p>
<p>The five crates of Italian valuables were discovered gathering dust in a Treasury vault earlier this year, some 35 years after they were handed to the state for safekeeping.</p>
<p>The Treasury said the plundered property was moved to Austria by the retreating Germans at the end of World War Two and was later returned to Trieste, where some of the belongings were returned to their owners.</p>
<p>Remaining items were boxed up and sent to Rome.</p>
<p>A parliamentary commission drew up a bill ordering that the crates should be handed back to the Jewish community and the law was ratified in just one month -- almost a record for Italy's notoriously slow legislature.</p>
<p>Giorgio Wiesenfeld, the president of the Jewish association in Trieste, said he hoped relatives would come forward and claim the lost belongings.</p>
<p>Property which went unclaimed would either be put in a local museum or else sold to raise funds for educational and humanitarian projects.</p>
