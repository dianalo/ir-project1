<p>The five Thai political parties now in opposition said on Thursday they had formed an alliance and vowed to be the core of a new coalition government if they won a majority of seats in the November 17 general election.</p>
<p>The main opposition Democrat Party, Chart Pattana, Palang Dharma Party, Seritham and Solidarity parties, who together now control 182 of the 391 seats in parliament, made the pact at a meeting, party officials said.</p>
<p>"After the election, if the five parties of the opposition block win a majority, we will form a new coalition," Banyat Banthathan, deputy leader of the Democrat Party, said afterward.</p>
<p>"Even though we might have to fight each other in some constituencies, they will be friendly fights," he told reporters.</p>
<p>The move to form the alliance was widely seen as a serious attempt to block the New Aspiration Party (NAP) of Defence Minister General Chavalit Yongchaiyudh from coming to power, political analysts said.</p>
<p>The cash-rich NAP has been the main beneficiary of defections from outgoing premier Banharn Silpa-archa's Chart Thai party, which controls 91 seats in the current parliament. Chavalit is also seen as a leading candidate for the premiership after the polls.</p>
<p>The exact numbers of defections to the NAP were not known, but secretary general of the Chart Thai party Sanoh Tienthong deserted Banharn's party to join the NAP with about 30 members of parliament from his faction.</p>
<p>Most of the 18 MPs belonging to the small Nam Thai party led by Foreign Minister Amnuay Viravan also said they would stand under an NAP ticket in the elections. The Nam Thai said it had disbanded and Amnuay declared he would not stand in the elections.</p>
<p>Political parties are waiting for the election commission to set the date for registration of candidates for the polls, after which party-hopping must stop.</p>
