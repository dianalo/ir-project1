<p>The Peruvian economy grew 4.1 percent year-on-year in February compared with 4.2 percent growth in the year to February 1996, the National Institute of Statistics and Information (INEI) said Friday.</p>
<p>Growth in the year to February was down slightly from 4.5 percent year-on-year growth to January, the INEI figures showed.  </p>
<p>February's year-on-year growth was led by the construction sector at 15.9 percent, followed by agriculture with 11.3 percent.</p>
<p>The worst performing sector to February was fishing, which contracted 29.0 percent.</p>
<p>Among other sectors, commerce rose 3.6 percent, mining 3.5 percent, electricity and water 3.1 percent, and manufacturing 0.6 percent. The INEI's miscellaneous category, including the transport, financial and government sectors, rose 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>President Alberto Fujimori said last month that Peru was headed for overall GDP growth of four to five percent in 1997. Peru's GDP rose 2.8 percent in 1996 versus 7.0 percent the previous year.</p>
<p>GDP figures provided by the INEI often differ slightly from those of the central bank, which are published later, because the bank collects additional information from the country's customs agency SUNAD, according to bank officials.</p>
