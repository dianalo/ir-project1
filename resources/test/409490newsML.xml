<headline>DBRS confirms Eaton credit card trust ratings.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO 1997-02-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dominion Bond Rating Service on Friday said it confirmed the long and short term debt ratings of Eaton Credit Card Trust at AAA and R-1 (high).  </p>
<p>The Toronto-based rating agency on Thursday placed the trust "under review with developing implications," pending clarification of certain legal matters and receipt of the final CCAA filing as approved by the court.</p>
<p>DBRS said it had a chance to confirm those legal matters. The agency said it reviewed the final CCAA filing and there had been no significant legal challenges to the operations of Eaton Credit Corporation and its subsidiaries.  </p>
<p>The agency said it is of the opinion that there should be no significant impact on the trust and its operations. There is the potential for subsequent challenges and stays as approved by the court which may have an impact on the timing of payments, particularly if an "Amortization Event" should occur, DBRS said.</p>
<p>The agency said the expectation is investors will receive 100 percent of invested funds but the DBRS rating does not consider any opportunity costs associated with early amortization.</p>
