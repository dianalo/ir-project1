<p>Honda Oil &amp; Gas Co said Wednesday it suspended the testing and completion of its Opon No. 6 well in Colombia to analyze data after a second completion attempt was made following a mechanical failure of the perforating guns.</p>
<p>It appeared some of the new perforations were blocked, a company statement said. Honda expects the analysis to take about three months, it added.</p>
