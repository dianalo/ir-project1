<p>The Singapore rubber market was thin at the close on Wednesday with most consumers sitting on the sidelines to wait for leads due to uncertainty about the currency problems in the region, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The big boys are simply not there. The currency problems here are still making people nervous. Bridgestone wanted to buy some rubber, but no deals were concluded," a dealer said.</p>
<p>Bridgestone was said to be in the market for forward shipments of RSS3 rubber, but the price they were asking was too low and sellers were forced to back out as a result, traders said.  </p>
<p>Michelin, which embarked on its monthly programme last week, is now out of the market. "Michelin filled up whatever they needed in RSS3 rubber," a trader said.</p>
<p>"It's a very quiet market. Some consumers asked for price indications this afternoon, and then decided to sit back and do nothing," another trader added. The strong performance of the Tokyo rubber market failed to inspire the local market.</p>
<p>At 0945 GMT, September RSS3 was indicated at 95.75 U.S. cents a kg from 95.25 cents. September RSS1 was seen at 140.50 Singapore cents (96 U.S. cents) a kg from 139.50 cents.</p>
