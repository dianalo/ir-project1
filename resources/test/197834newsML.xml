<p>The Budget Council will attempt on Tuesday to hold the line on a 1997 budget plan which achieves zero growth, an unprecedented attempt at spending restraint, diplomats said on Monday.</p>
<p>Although the EU's budget is relatively small in comparison with total output in the bloc, the battle to contain spending reflects the struggle national governments are having to curb their own budgets ahead of monetary union.</p>
<p>The ministers will take up recent proposals by the European Parliament, which has a say over internal and external policies such as aid to foreign countries.</p>
<p>The parliament has no control over agricultural spending, the area which takes up the lion's share of the EU's budget.</p>
<p>Specifically, the ministers will consider the parliament's proposal for a special reserve of 300 million Ecus to finance trans-European rail and road projects and a special programme for Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>"They will not accept the special reserve of 300 million (Ecus)," one diplomat said.</p>
<p>The battle over additional money for trans-European networks, the so-called TENs, has been at the heart of the European Commission's plans to spur greater employment growth.</p>
<p>The Commission has argued that more money is needed to complete the large infrastructure projects, which include an extension of high speed rail links across Europe.</p>
<p>EU budget and finance ministers, however, have repeatedly rejected the appeals, arguing that insufficient funds were not responsible for the slow pace of completion.</p>
<p>Overall, the ministers will propose a budget for 1997 worth 88.585 billion Ecus in commitments and 81,790 billion Ecus in payments. This compares with 1996 commitments of 86.580 billion Ecus and payments of 81,943 billion Ecus.</p>
<p>The ministers will also consider the costs of eradicating mad cow disease. When the parliament last discussed the budget in October, there was no agreement on allocating future funds to help beef farmers through the crisis caused by the disease, properly called bovine spongiform encephalopathy.</p>
<p>The parliament will take up the EU's budget plan again in December, at which point the EU's budget becomes final. Typically, the parliament reinstates the cuts the ministers propose.</p>
