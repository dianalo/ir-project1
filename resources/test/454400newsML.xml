<p>One day after German industrial giant Thyssen vowed to fend off a hostile takeover by rival Fried. Krupp AG, the two companies said Wednesday they would talk about forming a joint steel group that would be one of the world's largest.</p>
<p>Krupp and Thyssen said in a joint statement that they would hold eight days of talks aimed at a steel cooperation agreement. If successful, the talks would void Krupp's 13.6 billion mark ($8 billion) bid for Thyssen, made Tuesday.</p>
<p>But if they failed to reach a pact in the agreed time, the two would return to their original positions, meaning Krupp could renew its generous offer to Thyssen shareholders.</p>
<p>In a meeting with Thyssen Chairman Dieter Vogel and North Rhine-Westphalia State Premier Johannes Rau, the ambitious Krupp Chairman Gerhard Cromme appears to have won at least a week to persuade them that cooperation makes sense.</p>
<p>The possibility of a merger in the German steel industry, based in North Rhine-Westphalia, has raised the prospect of heavy job losses at a time when unemployment is at its highest since 1933.</p>
<p>Underscoring the importance of preserving jobs, the Bild newspaper quoted Chancellor Helmut Kohl as urging the two companies to "live up to their total responsibilities."</p>
<p>"In the interest of those employed by both companies and in the interest of the economic climate in our country, the issue is to find a reasonable solution," said Kohl.</p>
<p>Economics minister Guenter Rexrodt said the talks between Krupp and Thyssen could help to boost the industry's international competitiveness.</p>
<p>"The two want to reach the goal of long-term competitiveness on their own ... and have not sought state subsidies, as is often the case in other places," he said.</p>
<p>Thousands of Thyssen steel workers decided to return to work Wednesday after stopping production for two days. But they worried about their jobs as they awaited the outcome of the talks.</p>
<p>"The problems won't just be wiped off the table. We are watching this process critically," said Dieter Kroll, who heads an employees' council at unit Thyssen Stahl.</p>
<p>Newspaper editorials criticised the job cuts likely to result from a merger. But the two steelmakers said in their statement that they had common problems that could be better solved by a larger entity.</p>
<p>A larger company might find it easier to cut the chronic overcapacity seen as one of the European steel industry's main impediments. High production costs in Germany are also a problem shared by both companies.</p>
<p>A combination of the their steel operations would produce one of Europe's largest producers in tonnage output, in the same league with British Steel and France's Usinor Sacilor.</p>
