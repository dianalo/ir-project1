<p>U.S. financial news and information supplier Bloomberg L.P. launched a cable television news channel in France on Wednesday in partnership with Agence France-Presse (AFP) and Paris business radio station BFM.</p>
<p>The French-language channel of Bloomberg Television will initially broadcast a mixture of international and French financial and general news two hours a day from 6.30 to 8.30 a.m. (0430-0630 GMT) on a split screen combining prices, news headlines, weather, video and advertising.  </p>
<p>Bloomberg president Michael Bloomberg told a news conference the venture was part of a broader strategy to broadcast local television in all the world's major capital-market countries.</p>
<p>AFP provides a digest of political and general news, read from a studio at its Paris headquarters, and BFM provides French financial and business news.</p>
<p>Bloomberg said he hoped to forge a broader long-term alliance with AFP, taking advantage of its language services in other countries.</p>
<p>The news agency's chairman, Jean Miot, told the joint news conference that AFP needed to develop new products but did not plan to go into television news gathering or production.</p>
