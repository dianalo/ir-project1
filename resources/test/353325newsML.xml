<p>Frenchman Richard Virenque started the 1997 cycling season in style by taking the opening road event, the Grand Prix de La Marseillaise, after an impressive solo ride on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Virenque, third in last year's Tour de France, broke away after seven kilometres in the 136-km race from Vitrolles, near Marseille.</p>
<p>The pocket-sized climber from the Festina stable built a lead of up to 11 minutes on a lazy peloton and crossed the line seven minutes ahead of a breakaway group of six riders.</p>
<p>Frenchman Gilles Bouvard won the sprint from the following group to take second place ahead of Czech Jan Svorada into third place.</p>
<p>The pack came in more than nine minutes behind Virenque with Swiss Rolf Jaermann winning the sprint for eighth place.</p>
<p>The next race is the five-day Etoile de Besseges, which sets off from Nimes on Wednesday. Svorada, who won it last year, will be among the favourites.</p>
<p>Virenque said he would not be taking part.</p>
