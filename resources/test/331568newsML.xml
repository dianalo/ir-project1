<p>The United States' Cuba policy, which has angered its Western allies while failing to get rid of President Fidel Castro, is largely shaped by a small but powerful Cuban exile group in Miami, a study said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Center for Public Integrity said the Cuban American National Foundation (CANF), headed by Jorge Mas Canosa, had created a lobbying force that was "dollar for dollar arguably the most effective in Washington."</p>
<p>Its main successes included pushing the passage last year of the Helms-Burton Act, aimed at curbing foreign investment in Cuba. The act provoked sharp criticism from U.S. allies in Canada, Europe and Latin America, who have threatened retaliatory action against what they see as an attempt to dictate their foreign policies.</p>
<p>The CPI report, entitled "Squeeze Play: The United States, Cuba and the Helms Burton Act," said Washington's main mission with regard to Cuba since soon after the 1959 revolution had been to oust Castro. But all its efforts, ranging from armed invasion to a trade embargo, had failed.</p>
<p>"We have found that a portion of the exile community -- educated, hard-working, passionate in its hatred for Castro and generous to those politicians who take a similarly hard line -- has helped maintain and strengthen a policy that in other cases might have been vastly different," it said.</p>
<p>The Washington-based, non-profit research organization added that while the United States took a hard line with Cuba, it traded with China and other dictatorial regimes with poor human rights records.</p>
<p>Bodies with a direct interest in Cuba's future had poured $4.4 million into U.S. political coffers since 1979, it said. "Of that amount $3.2 million came from trustees, directors and officers of the Cuban American National Foundation, which since its inception in 1981 has become the most potent voice on U.S. policy towards Cuba."</p>
<p>It cited as an example the case of Democrat Robert Torricelli of New Jersey, who it said had once supported a partial lifting of the embargo but had been won over by Mas Canosa's lobbying. "He became one of Castro's fiercest opponents and one of Mas Canosa's staunchest allies" and got more than $120,000 in contributions from the CANF, it said.</p>
<p>The lobby was also instrumental in the creation of Radio and TV Marti, which broadcast to the communist-ruled island from Miami, and the passage of the 1992 Cuba Democracy Act, which eliminated U.S. subsidiary trade with Cuba.</p>
<p>"On the other side, pro-dialogue groups have been loosely organized, poorly funded, divided on goals and tactics and at times silenced by acts of violence by anti-Castro extremists," said the 100-page study, the result of a year's research. Nor had U.S. business lobbied hard for a change in policy, as it had in the case of Vietnam, it added.</p>
<p>Miami has a huge Cuban community and the CANF is senior among a myriad of anti-Castro organizations. Mas Canosa, a millionaire businessman, is widely believed to covet the Cuban presidency if and when Castro's reign ends.</p>
<p>The CANF denounced the report, calling one of its funders, the ARCA Foundation, a partisan, left-wing organization.</p>
<p>"Clearly ARCA has bought and paid for what amounts to nothing more than a contract political hit on the Cuban American community and their participation on the American political process," CANF president Francisco Hernandez said.</p>
<p>"Obviously the purpose is an attempt to discredit the Cuban American community and undermine U.S. policy toward Cuba."</p>
<p>Linclon Diaz-Balart, a Republican U.S. congressman of Cuban descent who vehemently opposes Castro, said the study was a "political hatchet job" and showed that certain groups in the United States actively served Castro's interests.</p>
<p>The CPI concentrates on public service and ethics-related issues. Its funders include the Carnegie Foundation and the Rockefeller Family Fund.</p>
