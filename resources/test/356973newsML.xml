<headline>FOCUS - Chaos or foulplay behind Brazil trade woes?</headline>

<p>Brazil's decision Wednesday to withhold its January trade balance because of a missing $650 million in oil imports raised eyebrows, with players concluding simple chaos was probably more at fault than nefarious foulplay.</p>
<p>The ministries of finance and of industry and commerce announced the postponement a bare hour before the scheduled publication of the data, which officials had triumphantly claimed would be Brazil's first positive monthly trade result since last May.  </p>
<p>"We don't know what happened. That's what we have to find out," said an aide to Finance Minister Pedro Malan.</p>
<p>"I think it's a case of chaos. You've got a new system, poor planning, throw in some inept management and this is what you get," said a New York economic analyst, asking not to be named.</p>
<p>The bogeyman for the numbers chaos is the government's new SISCOMEX import registration system, brought on line on January 1 and immediately subjected to a barrage of abuse from importers and newspapers for its teething problems.  </p>
<p>Last week, foreign trade secretary Mauricio Cortes said the January result would be in equilibrium and that SISCOMEX had not affected the numbers beyond persuading some importers to stock up in December in anticipation of some difficulties.</p>
<p>But on Wednesday, the government acknowledged January's $60 million surplus might actually have been a $600 million deficit because $650 million in fuel imports by state oil firm Petrobras had not been registered in the SISCOMEX system.</p>
<p>The government said there were no other inconsistencies with the registered imports.  </p>
<p>On the face of it, it would be illegal to import oil without a SISCOMEX registration, officials said.</p>
<p>"It could be (that Petrobras has been involved in irregularities)," said a senior Finance Ministry official. "But, then again, there could be any number of reasons."</p>
<p>Petrobras officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Newspapers have speculated whether the government might be using problems with SISCOMEX to massage its monthly trade figures, turning deficits into more comely surpluses.</p>
<p>But analysts and trade watchers dismissed that as spurious.  </p>
<p>"Give me one good practical reason why they would want to do that," said S. Stefani, editor of car industry magazine Autodata which has been probing car makers claims that SISCOMEX problems were interrupting their supply of imported parts.</p>
<p>Matt Taylor of Sao Paulo market consultants Trend Analise Economica agreed.</p>
<p>"I think everyone is in the dark," he said. "They can massage the figures to a certain degree but there's not an awful lot of leeway to do that on a long-term basis. Eventually the numbers have to add up."</p>
<p>The trouble with the computer system was reminiscent of 1994 when SISCOMEX was introduced for exports. Brasilia decided then to announce trade figures only for the first quarter.</p>
<p>Analysts said that would be the best way to deal with 1997.</p>
<p>"No one really knows what is going to show up in February. SISCOMEX was put in too hurriedly and we think it will be better to look at trade for the first quarter as a whole rather than month on month," said Taylor</p>
<p>Trend Analise Economica is predicting a first quarter trade gap of between $2.0-2.4 billion.</p>
