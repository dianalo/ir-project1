<p>-- LANICA FACES AUDIT PROBE OVER NAAFI DEAL</p>
<p>The National Audit Office is to investigate a deal involving Lanica Trust, the investment company of failed Co-operative Wholesale Society bidder Andrew Regan, and Naafi, the armed services' official trading arm. The two groups jointly owned Select Catalogues, a private mail order company which has exclusive worldwide rights to sell non-food items such as TVs, fitness equipment and toys to service personnel. The NAO is to probe the circumstances in which the company was set up, citing concern over whether the Ministry of Defence got value for money.</p>
<p>-- FLOAT DELAY FOR TUNNEL RAIL LINK</p>
<p>London &amp; Continental Railways is expected Wednesday to officially concede that its planned floatation has been delayed. The consortium, which is led by Virgin and National Express, won the contract to build the Channel tunnel rail link last February. However, it has found that it has taken longer than expected to turn round Eurostar, the Channel tunnel rail passenger service, and the Stock Market flotation is now expected to take place next year rather than this autumn.</p>
<p>-- POST OFFICE TO DELIVER NEW CITY HQ FOR MERRILL</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch, the US stockbroker, is to keep its UK headquarters in the City of London rather than move eastwards to London's Docklands. The firm is to buy the Post Office building between St Bart's Hospital and St Paul's Cathedral and construct a 400m stg block to house up to 4,000 staff. US architects Swanke Hayden Connell, who built New York's Trump Tower and refurbished the Empire State Building, will design the new HQ.</p>

<p>-- INTEREST RATES SET TO RISE AFTER SURGE IN INFLATION</p>
<p>A rise in interest rates looks inevitable after a surge in inflation last month. It is expected that the Bank of England will raise rates a further quarter-point to 6.75 per cent Wednesday, adding an extra 14 pounds per month to the average 50,000 pound mortgage. Politicians from all parties have voiced concerns over the impact of a still strengthening pound on exporters.</p>
<p>-- DEBENHAMS TO DEMERGE FROM BURTON</p>
<p>John Hoerner, chief executive of retail fashion group Burton, has announced the demerger of the Debenhams department store division from the core group. Hoerner, who was brought to Burton to run the Debenhams side, will now take direct control of the remaining group, which includes Top Shop, Top Man, Principles, Burton Menswear, Evans and Dorothy Perkins. The move is an attempt to arrest the sharp decline in the share price of Burton.</p>
<p>-- BARCLAY TWINS TARGET THE INDEPENDENT</p>
<p>The newspaper company of the Barclay twins is understood to be seeking to acquire The Independent and the Sunday Independent titles. Andrew Neil, editor-in-chief of the company, has approached both the Mirror Group and Independent Newspapers of Ireland - which each own 46.4 per cent of the two titles - about taking control of the two papers. The Barclays' portfolio currently includes The Scotsman, Scotland On Sunday, and The European, and the brothers believe the Mirror Group may be looking to raise cash following last week's agreement to buy Midland Independent Newspapers.</p>

<p>-- GEC UNVEILS 2BN STG STRATEGY</p>
<p>GEC managing director George Simpson has unveiled an over 2bn stg restructuring plan for the company in an attempt to create a world-leading defence group which could eventually merge with British Aerospace. The four-year programme involves investments and the selling-off of peripheral businesses, with Simpson noting that if acquisitions could not be attained quickly enough, cash will be returned to shareholders.</p>
<p>-- SAVILLS PAYS RECORD BONUS</p>
<p>Due to what Savills estate agency chief executive Aubrey Adams called a very buoyant property market, the group has awarded its top performer with a 300,000 stg City-style bonus. Adams revealed that even the most junior member of staff was to receive a bonus of about 1,000 pounds stg, as impending higher interest rates seem to pose 'only a bit of a threat' to the market. The agency has dismissed chancellor Gordon Brown's increase of stamp duty from 1 to 1.5 per cent on more expensive homes as 'irrelevant'.</p>
<p>-- THOSE WITH THE WOOLWICH SEE SHARES TUMBLE</p>
<p>Following a remarkable first day of trading in shares of Woolwich banking society which saw prices reach as high as 373.5p, prices fell a dramatic 32.5p on Tuesday, to close at 301.5p as the City sought to wipe almost 1bn stg off its valuation of the company. London officials estimate shares are to fall further to 290p at the second of four institutional auctions.</p>

<p>- MURDOCH LOOKS FOR PUBLISHER PARTNER</p>
<p>Media magnate Rupert Murdoch has indicated he may be looking for a possible joint venture partner for his HarperCollins publishing subsidiary. The publishing house, which Murdoch formed in 1989 with the merging of UK company William Collins &amp; Sons with Harper &amp; Row of the US, is struggling to recover from recent losses. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing, the group owned by German media group Bertelsmann which has said it is looking for North American acquisitions, could be one possible candidate.</p>
<p>-- DALGETY CHIEF 'IS LIVING ON BORROWED TIME'</p>
<p>Dalgety, the food manufacturer, has issued a profits warning and announced 100m stg of unexpected charges. Shares in the company, famous for its Winalot and Felix pet foods, lost more than 15 per cent of their value Tuesday following the trading statement. Institutional investors reacted angrily, warning Dalgety chief executive Richard Clothier that he was 'living on borrowed time'.</p>
<p>-- AMSTRAD SET TO APPEAL AGAINST SEAGATE AWARD</p>
<p>UK technology company Amstrad has said it is considering renewing legal action against Seagate Technology after claiming the High Court has miscalculated how much interest the US company owed to Amstrad from a long-running legal dispute. Seagate was ordered to pay Amstrad 57.5m stg in damages for delivering faulty goods, plus 28m stg in interest. The UK company now says the revised damages total should be at least 95m stg.</p>
