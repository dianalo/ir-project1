<p>Canadian Auto Workers union president Buzz Hargrove said on Thursday he is hopeful an agreement can be reached by Monday with General Motors Corp's Canadian unit that would end a strike by some 26,000 workers.</p>
<p>"If there is an effort as indicated to us by Mr. Smith and his team, if that gets down to the bargaining table, I would be cautiously optimistic that we could do this by Monday at noon," Hargrove told a news conference.</p>
<p>His comments followed an unprecedented meeting on Wednesday with GM chief executive Jack Smith in Toronto.  </p>
<p>The face-to-face meeting, the first ever in Canada between a GM chief executive and a leader of the Canadian auto union, broke a logjam in negotiations between the two sides, raising optimism that the two-week-old strike could end next week.</p>
<p>Hargrove said the union has already set general membership meetings for Wednesday October 23 to ratify any tentative agreement that may be reached on Monday.</p>
<p>If an agreement is ratified, the workers could be back at work at GM plants across Canada by Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We could be going back in Wednesday afternoon," Hargrove said.  </p>
<p>The strike, which began on October 2, has paralyzed GM plants throughout Canada and has also idled 7,536 auto workers in the United States and Mexico, General Motors said on Thursday.</p>
