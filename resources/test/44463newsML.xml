<p>U.S. shares traded in London failed to follow Wall Street's overnight lead on Tuesday despite the Dow's biggest gain in over a month, dealers said.</p>
<p>Activity was described as "very, very quiet" with few features to enliven business.</p>
<p>U.S. stocks surged on Monday as investors again took heart from Friday's payroll numbers and grew more confident that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates only modestly, if at all, at its meeting on September 24.</p>
<p>The Dow closed nearly 74 points higher at 5,734 and is now less than 50 points from its record high of 5,778 set on May 22.  </p>
<p>Wall Street was expected to open steadily but London traders admitted it was a difficult market to call.</p>
<p>"It may not set another record today and we could see it consolidate but who can tell? - we said the same thing yesterday," said one.</p>
<p>This afternoon sees the release of July wholesale trade data and second quarter revised productivity but all eyes remain on inflation data due at the end of the week.</p>
<p>"It'll be the back end of the week that will set the tone going forward but at the moment Europeans just aren't interested in trading," said the trader.</p>
