<p>A power struggle between the Greek government and the Greek Athletics Federation (SEGAS) threatens to wreck the world athletics championships set for Athens next year, sports officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>SEGAS, which has signed a contract with the International Athletics Federation (IAAF) to run the 19-event championship, has withdrawn from its organising committee, saying it was being marginalised by the state.</p>
<p>"Under current circumstances we will no longer participate in any way or form in "Athens 97" and we will not accept responsibility for any problems that will arise," SEGAS President Statos Molivas told reporters this week.</p>
<p>He said Sports Minister Andreas Fouras had left SEGAS outside every important decision concerning the championship and had not allowed it to run agreed funds."</p>
<p>"We call on the state to give us back our rights that it took away. If we are to talk with the state this must be done from a zero basis," Molivas told reporters.</p>
<p>Fouras said Molivas was "crazy" and literally called on the SEGAS board to replace him. He said the championship will be held as scheduled next August despite SEGAS' boycott but did not say how.</p>
<p>"This is embarassing Greece to say the least," a senior Greek sports official told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The championship can't be held without SEGAS and Fouras must find a way to replace Molivas. There is no room for compromise. It will not be easy, however, because Molivas is elected by SEGAS's board and not appointed by the state," he said.</p>
<p>The year-old internal friction has prompted IAAF and other international sports bodies to send several warnings to Greece, describing the handling of the world championship as a test for Athens's bid to host the 2004 Olympic Games.</p>
<p>Greek newspapers said that the first signs of trouble for the Olympic bid have already become apparent in another power struggle between Athens Mayor Dimitris Avramopoulos and Bidding Committee President Yanna Angelopoulou.</p>
<p>"They will appear united next week when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) visits Athens to evaluate the bid but there is certainly a power struggle between them. They often work in different directions," the sports official said.</p>
<p>"They must all realise that unless there is organised team work we might as well forget the Olympics again," he added.</p>
<p>Athens lost the 1996 Games to Atlanta because of its lack of organisation and poor infrastructure. It initially threatened to boycott centennial Olympic festivities and never bid for the Games again.</p>
<p>Fouras's predecessor George Lianis had angered the IOC by insisting Greece, the birthplace of the Olympics, had a special right to the Games and that in 2004, Athens, should be given the Olympics without even bidding.</p>
<p>IOC's concerns over Athens as a site for the 1996 Olympics have been largely justified.</p>
<p>An Athens metro which was supposed to be ready before the 1996 Games is only half completed. Work on a new international airport, also supposed to be ready by 1996, has just began. --Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
