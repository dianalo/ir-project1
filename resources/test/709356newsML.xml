<p>Emily Lau, one of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy figures, called on Sunday for clear limits to be set to the powers of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) in the new Special Administrative Region (SAR).</p>
<p>"It would be nice to know the PLA cannot get involved in SAR affairs unless it has the approval of the SAR government. In fact the relationship between the PLA and the SAR has not been spelled out," Lau said on government radio.</p>
<p>"Unlike the British colonial governor who was always commander-in-chief of the garrison, (chief executive) Tung Chee-hwa has no control over the PLA," she said.</p>
<p>"Unless and until (the relationship) is clearly defined, the local people will always be worried about possible interference by the PLA," Lau added.</p>
<p>Britain handed Hong Kong back to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30 after 156 years of colonial rule. The world watched as PLA troops rolled into Hong Kong to replace the British garrison.</p>
<p>China has promised Hong Kong a considerable amount of autonomy, but intends to handle the region's foreign affairs and defence needs.</p>
<p>Hong Kong has been haunted by images of the PLA crushing the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy movement in Beijing in 1989.</p>
<p>"If we cast our minds back to 1989 we will recall that even the general secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, Zhao Ziyang, could not stop the massacre," Lau said.</p>
<p>Shortly before troops with tanks moved on the student-led protesters, killing hundreds of them, Zhao went to the square to plead tearfully with the students, admitting that he had come too late.</p>
<p>"If even Mr. Zhao could not stop the massacre, how can we believe that Mr. Tung could," Lau said.</p>
