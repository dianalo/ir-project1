<p>Turkey has welcomed mediation proposals by Iran to settle Turkey's disputes with Greece and Syria and Tehran will send a delegation to Athens in the near future, Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati said.</p>
<p>Velayati made his comments to reporters in Tehran, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said late on Sunday.</p>
<p>"...Velayati said...that Ankara has welcomed Iran's mediation proposal to settle Turkey's disputes with Greece and Syria...He said practical steps will be taken in this regard in a near future," IRNA said.</p>
<p>"Tehran will launch new efforts with the consent of Turkey, Greece and Syria, said Velayati adding, that delegations will be dispatched to Athens in a near future to discuss with Greek officials on settlement of Greece-Turkey disputes," IRNA added.</p>
<p>Turkey and Greece are at odds over the Mediterranean island of Cyprus, which has been virtually partitioned into a Greek Cypriot south and a Turkish Cypriot north since troops from Turkey landed in 1974 in response to a brief coup in Nicosia engineered by the junta then ruling Greece.</p>
<p>Only Turkey recognises the north.</p>
<p>Britain this month put forward a 10-point plan to get peace talks under way on the divided island.</p>
<p>Velayati said Iran would discuss its mediation effort with Syrian Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam who is due to visit Iran in January.</p>
<p>Turkey and Syria have long been at odds over Syria's alleged support for the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebel group and sharing the waters of the Euphrates River. Earlier this year they accused each other of moving troops towards their border.</p>
<p>A Turkish military accord with Israel has also aggravated the row with Damascus.</p>
