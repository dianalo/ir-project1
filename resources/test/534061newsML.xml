<p>Philips Electronics NV said on Wednesday it was confident that its previously loss-making consumer products unit was on track to provide sustainable growth.</p>
<p>Philips earlier announced first quarter net from normal operations up 22 percent at 460 million guilders with the consumer products unit turning in an operating profit of 206 million guilders against a previous 52 million loss.</p>
<p>The unit has historically been weighed down by losses from Philips' German affiliate Grundig, but from the beginning of 1997 Philips stopped absorbing 100 percent of Grundig's losses.</p>
<p>Philips said it was also beginning to reap the benefits of last year's 800 million guilder pre-tax extraordinary charge to restructure the Sound &amp; Vision unit at the heart of its consumer products activities.</p>
<p>"We are very pleased that after a hell of a lot of work -- that's not finished by any means, one swallow doesn't make a summer -- they have demonstrated to themselves and (to) the outside world that they can make money at their business," Philips vice chairman Dudley Eustace told a news conference. "They are profitable and they are cash positive and those two are fundamental to a healthy future," he said.  </p>
<p>Eustace said the fundamental changes being made in Sound &amp; Vision, how it managed its technical and logistical development, would be lasting.</p>
<p>"The benefits of the purchasing program, the cost reduction program have shown through, whereby Sound &amp; Vision has been able to outrun the price pressure by lower costs," he said.</p>
<p>"I have some confidence that this team has already made its mark on a more permanent basis, in creating a sustainable profitable business," Eustace told reporters. -- Keiron Henderson, Amsterdam Newsroom +31 20 504 5000</p>
