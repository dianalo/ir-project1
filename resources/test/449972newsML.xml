<p>Malaysian oil and gas company Trenergy (Malaysia) Bhd said on Tuesday it was not aware of the reason for the sharp increase in its share price recently.</p>
<p>The company said this in a statement to the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange in response to a query for unusual market action on the stock.</p>
<p>"We are not aware of any rumours or the existence of other conditions that might influence our company's shares. There has not been any material development in our company's business and affairs which has not been previously disclosed," Trenergy said.</p>
<p>The stock had been gaining since last week over speculation that the company had won an oil and gas contract in an eastern Malaysian state.</p>
<p>Trenergy closed 50 cents lower at 10.10 ringgit on Tuesday.</p>
