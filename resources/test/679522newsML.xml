<p>Canada's Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. has agreed to buy Sphere Drake Holdings Ltd., a reinsurer based in Bermuda, for about $138 million plus other payments and the assumption of debt, the companies said Monday.</p>
<p>The deal, the latest in the reinsurance business, would make Fairfax Financial into a major new player in the sector. A year ago it acquired Skandia America Re for $230 million, renaming it Odyssey Reinsurance and giving Fairfax its first foothold outside the United States.</p>
<p>Then it bought Compagnie Transcontinentale de Reassurance from troubled French insurer GAN for about $120 million, providing it with a stronghold in Europe.</p>
<p>The latest deal would give it a presence in the two most important reinsurance centres, London and Bermuda. Reinsurance companies spread the risk taken on by an insurance company in exchange for part of the premium for a policy that the insurer would not otherwise be able to pay on its own.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Sphere Drake shareholders will receive $7.50 a share in cash or stock, or about $138 million, plus $9.86 a share payable in 10 years. Fairfax will also assume Sphere Drake's bank debt of $100 million.</p>
<p>"By joining Fairfax, Sphere Drake Holdings Ltd. will become part of a global insurance and reinsurance group benefiting from the critical mass necessary to be competitive in today's marketplace," Sphere Drake Chief Executive Michael Watson said.</p>
<p>Sphere Drake saw first quarter 1997 profits drop to $2.9 million from $9.6 million a year earlier due to tough market conditions and began a major restructuring of operations in Bermuda and London.</p>
<p>The deal is subject to approval by British and Bermuda regulators and is expected to be completed late this year.</p>
