<p>President Bill Clinton on Saturday hailed a budget compromise with the Republican-controlled Congress that avoids another government shutdown, saying it showed "what happens when you abandon extremism."</p>
<p>Discussing the budget breakthrough hammered out by congressional leaders and White House negotiators, Clinton told a campaign rally that "It is good for America."</p>
<p>With the November elections looming over the negotiators, representatives of the White House and Congress held marathon talks that early on Saturday produced a spending plan for the new fiscal year, which begins on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Emboldened by a public backlash that blamed Republicans for twice shutting the federal government during the fight over the current federal budget, Clinton was able to shape spending priorities more to his liking by threatening to use his veto power.</p>
<p>"In the last three months, as the American people have made it clear that they have no intention of seeing our country torn apart and divided by a radical agenda, we have restored a measure of bipartisanship and working together in Washington," Clinton said.</p>
<p>"Look what happens when you abandon extremism in favour of working together," Clinton told an outdoor rally in the heart of downtown Providence.</p>
<p>White House officials said it was "no coincidence" that Clinton's reference to improved working relations with Congress over the last three months coincides with the point when Republican rival Bob Dole stepped down as Senate majority leader.</p>
<p>Clinton told the crowd the budget accord was reached because "it reflects your priorities, and you have been speaking loud and clear."</p>
<p>The last budget battle with Congress wound up benefitting Clinton, who cast himself as a stalwart against extreme Republican ideas and the defender of funding for popular programmes like Medicare and Medicaid for the poor and elderly.</p>
<p>Clinton, who began his day in Texas, later appeared before a large and enthusiastic turnout in Fall River, Mass., at a rally for Democratic Sen. John Kerry -- who is locked in a tight race with William Weld, the state's popular Republican governor.</p>
<p>Earlier, he issued an executive order aimed at denying federal loans to deadbeat parents who fail to provide child support and announced the streamlining of a system designed to withhold federal payments from someone owing support.</p>
<p>"No area cries out for greater personal responsibility than the quiet crisis of child support," Clinton said in his weekly radio address. "No one should be able to escape responsibility for bringing a child into the world. It is our first and most fundamental duty."</p>
<p>He also announced the creation of a streamlined computer system to track individuals entitled to federal payments but owe child support. The money -- estimated by the Treasury Department at $800 million -- would be used to cover the support payments.</p>
<p>His executive order requires all federal agencies to take steps to deny federal loans -- such as small business, farm and home loans -- to individuals who do not meet their child support obligations.</p>
<p>"If you owe child support, you shouldn't get the support of the national government," Clinton said. "You can't make money off the taxpayers if you are refusing to support your family."</p>
<p>Although the federal government currently is withholding income tax refunds to offset child support debts, Clinton's action broadly expands the practice to other payments, including worker's compensation and military retirement and disability.</p>
