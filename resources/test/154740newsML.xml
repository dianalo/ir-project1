<p>Belgian national airline Sabena said on Wednesday it expected to finalise on Thursday a crucial deal with trade unions on a 4.7 billion Belgian franc ($149.7 million) recovery plan, a spokesman for the carrier said.</p>
<p>"It's too early to rejoice but normally it should all be over tomorrow, we should be able to meet the target date of October 31," Erik Sclep told Reuters.</p>
<p>Sabena, owned 49.5 percent by Swissair, has been negotiating since mid-June on chief executive Paul Reutlinger's 'Horizon 98' savings plan.</p>
<p>Management will account for 2.7 billion francs of the savings, but the rest has to come from labour-related cost reductions and is sought through a combination of job cuts, staff flexibility and internal transfers.</p>
