<p>Gencor Ltd's gold division Gengold said on Wednesday the recent fall in the gold price to an 18-month low was not worrying because it represented the bottom end of a long term trading range.</p>
<p>"The percentage decline of around two percent excites a lot of comment, but its real influence is on market sentiment," Gengold managing director Tom Dale told Reuters.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed on Tuesday in London at the lowest level since March 6, 1995. The precious metal was fixed at $378.65 in the afternoon and $377.05 in the morning.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, gold edged higher with the morning fix at $379.20 an ounce.</p>
<p>Dale said the move in the gold price represented less than one percentage point.</p>
<p>"The movement is really a storm in a teacup, it excites a lot of comment, but how far does it move in percentage terms, a quarter of a percent or something.</p>
<p>"It has been trading in a range between $375 and $400 since 1993. The fact that it is at the bottom of that range, I don't think should cause a great deal of excitement," he said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Dale said strong physical fabrication demand underpins the present level, adding another major factor affecting sentiment was continuing talk of International Monetary Fund gold sales.</p>
<p>The IMF planned to sell about five percent, or five million ounces of its gold reserve to finance increased aid to poor nations.</p>
<p>IMF Interim Committee Chairman Phillipe Maystadt said in Washington on Tuesday the world body would know sometime next year whether it will need to sell gold to finance aid.</p>
<p>"There is obviously negative sentiment being caused by the talk about IMF sales of gold and I think the thing that puts a cap on it is the fact that the demand side of the market is almost entirely fabrication demand which is price elastic," Dale added.</p>
<p>Analysts said South African gold producers would not be overtly worried about the drop in the gold price.</p>
<p>With the rand weakening against the dollar, South African mines still benefitted from the rand price of gold which was safely above 1,700 rand an ounce.</p>
<p>South Africa's gold industry, the largest in the world but facing declining production and increased costs, has received a boost since the rand shed a quarter of its value since February.</p>
<p>Dale said changes in the rand price were a major concern of the industry. "But more important to the managers of South African gold mines is cost control."</p>
