<p>Bargain-hunting and a firm bond market helped push Nasdaq stocks to a higher close.</p>
<p>A trader said the strong bounce in the Dow industrials through Wednesday encouraged buyers to get back into some of the technology issues.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite rose nearly seven to about 1217. Advances and declines were close to even.</p>
<p>Intel Corp shares continued their recovery, rising four to 138.</p>
<p>ESS Technology Inc fell 7-15/16 to 14-1/8 in active trading after it warned that price pressure in the audio and video markets is expected to result in narrower margins in the second quarter.</p>
<p>DSP Communications Inc fell 3-1/2 to 7-1/4 after the company said it expects lower revenue for at least one quarter as its csutomers focus on a new generation of products.</p>
<p>Andrew Corp skidded 12-1/8 to 23-1/2. The company reported second fiscal quarter earnings which were on target but revenues which were below expecations. Andrew said it expects order growth to pick up in the second half.</p>
