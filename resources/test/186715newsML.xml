<p>Egypt has nominated U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali for election to a second term, setting the stage for an expected United States veto as early as next Monday, council sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The nomination of the veteran Egyptian diplomat took the form of a letter from Egyptian U.N. envoy Nabil Elaraby, a council member, to council President Nugroho Wisnumurti of Indonesia. The matter will be discussed when the council holds consultations on Monday and then put to a vote at a formal meeting held behind closed doors -- the usual procedure when secret balloting for a secretary-general takes place.</p>
<p>The United States, which has a veto, has repeatedly threatened to block a second term for Boutros-Ghali on grounds the United Nations needs new leadership to carry out reforms.</p>
<p>U.N. officials said Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, French President Jacques Chirac, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, South African President Nelson Mandela, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien and Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina had written U.S. President Bill Clinton urging him to relent.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali's current five-year term as secretary- general expires Dec. 31. He turns 74 on Thursday.</p>
<p>A secretary-general is elected by the 185-nation General Assembly on the recommendation of the Security Council whose five permanent members  -- the United States, Russia, Britain, China and France -- all have a veto.</p>
<p>Elaraby's letter, obtained by Reuters, noted that two major regional organisations, the Organisation of African Unity and the Arab League, had endorsed Boutros-Ghali "for a second full term as secretary-general of the United Nations."</p>
<p>"Upon instructions from my government, I am formally submitting the candidature of His Excellency Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali of Egypt for re-election to the post of secretary-general of the United Nations and would appreciate it if you would circulate to members of the council, as an official document of the Security Council, this letter," Elaraby wrote.</p>
<p>He attached a declaration adopted unanimously at a summit meeting of African leaders at Yaounde, Cameroon, in July, recommending that steps be taken "to give Africa a second mandate, for the next five years, and (recommending) the candidature of Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a second term as secretary-general of the United Nations."</p>
<p>Elaraby wrote that Boutros-Ghali's candicacy "enjoys wide support by the majority of the United Nations membership and it is my government's hope that the outcome of the council's discussions will duly reflect the will of the majority."</p>
<p>If, as expected, Boutros-Ghali is vetoed on Monday, the way would then be open for the nomination of other candidates. Among those mentioned as possible successors to Boutros-Ghali are Undersecretary-General Kofi Annan of Ghana, who heads U.N. peacekeeping operations; Hamid Algabid of Niger, secretary-general of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference; and Olara Otunnu of Uganda, who heads the New York-based International Peace Academy.</p>
