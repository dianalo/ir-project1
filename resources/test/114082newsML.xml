<p>President Ernesto Zedillo reaffirmed Monday his faith in free-market economics and attacked his critics, the day after his government retreated on plans to fully privatize state-owned petrochemical plants.</p>
<p>"It is not market economics, nor the policies which are oriented towards strengthening it which, as some people insist in trying to make people believe, have provoked the deep inequality which afflicts our nations," Zedillo told a conference of Latin American economists.  </p>
<p>Zedillo, a former central bank economist, said a free market economy expanded production and stimulated investment. He strongly criticised the traditional statist model for Latin American economic development, widely practiced in the region in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.</p>
<p>"Statism, protectionism and authoritarianism, which fortunately are being relegated vigorously in Mexico and Latin America, signified the greatest obstacle to the development of the capacities of our countries and our people," he said.  </p>
<p>On Sunday, following fierce political opposition, Zedillo's government backed down on a four-year-old plan to sell off secondary petrochemical plants owned by state oil monopoly Pemex.</p>
<p>Instead, it said it would create a series of petrochemical subsidiaries and sell a minority stake in them to private investors. Future plants, however, could be built with entirely private capital.</p>
<p>Zedillo said his government had "opened and widened areas (of economic activity) to private investment, both national and foreign."</p>
<p>"Furthermore, we are making an intense effort to deregulate which is eliminating bureaucratic obstacles to productive activity", he said.</p>
