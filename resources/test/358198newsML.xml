<p>Sixteen months after O.J. Simpson was cleared of murder charges, a civil trial jury blamed him Tuesday for the brutal killings of his ex-wife and her friend and ordered him to pay $8.5 million in compensatory damages.</p>
<p>In the sequel to one of the most sensational murder trials of modern times, jurors unanimously found the ex-football star responsible for a deadly 1994 knife attack on Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, and declared that he acted with "malice" and "oppression."</p>
<p>The mostly white panel deliberated for six days before deciding on a judgment against Simpson -- effectively repudiating the not-guilty verdict that a predominantly black jury returned in less than four hours in his 1995 criminal case.</p>
<p>Simpson, 49, will serve no jail time, but he could lose much of what is left of the multimillion-dollar fortune he earned in his days as a star running back, advertising pitchman and sportscaster.</p>
<p>Along with compensatory damages awarded to the victims' families, he could be slapped with millions more in punitive damages -- designed to punish him for wrongdoing -- in the next phase of the trial set to begin as early as Thursday.</p>
<p>While crowds massed outside the courthouse and police went on alert to head off possible unrest, Simpson sat stoic and stone-faced in a hushed courtroom as the verdict was read.</p>
<p>The victims' family members, who brought the wrongful-death case and refused to drop it even after Simpson was acquitted of criminal charges, were clearly elated with the jury's decision.</p>
<p>Ron Goldman's sister, Kim, threw herself forward in her seat, shouting, "Oh my God!". Cheers erupted in the courtroom, and Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki warned spectators to keep silent or else they would be removed.</p>
<p>After a court clerk finished reading the verdict form, Fujisaki polled each of the jurors individually and they said they were unanimous in their decision.</p>
<p>Simpson left the courthouse to a chorus of boos from the hundreds of people gathered outside, and police ringed the black Chevrolet Suburban car he was riding in.</p>
<p>A ban on cameras in the courtroom prevented millions from witnessing the decisive moment in the courtroom drama as they did when the verdict was read on Oct. 3, 1995, in Simpson's nationally televised criminal trial. But from coast to coast, radio and televison stations broadcast live from outside the courthouse.</p>
<p>In their judgment against Simpson, jurors slapped him with $8.5 million in compensatory damages. Because Goldman's family members were the ones who filed a wrongful-death suit, the bulk of the money is payable to them as recompense for the loss of his love, companionship and moral support.</p>
<p>Nicole Brown Simpson's estate brought what is known as a "survivorship claim," which in the first round does not entitle it to compensatory damages.</p>
<p>However, the estate will share in any punitive damages, which jurors will decide based largely on how reprehensible the crime was. The judge told jurors to take Wednesday off but to return to court on Thursday morning, when the punitive damages phase may get under way.</p>
<p>Whatever the amount, the victims' families will have a hard time collecting. Simpson is all but certain to appeal, and the process could take years to sort out.</p>
<p>Also, his net worth, estimated at $11 million four years ago, has been decimated by legal costs, and most of his remaining $3 million is sunk into pension and retirement funds that are untouchable, according to a joint investigation by CNN and Time magazine.</p>
<p>Simpson's second trial did not amount to "double jeopardy" -- which is prohibited by law -- but rarely in the history of U.S. jurisprudence has a criminal defendant been acquitted only to be tried again on civil charges.</p>
<p>The panel of six men and six women consisted of nine whites, one Hispanic, one Asian-American and one member of mixed black and Asian descent -- a near reversal from the racial composition of the jury that was picked in downtown Los Angeles to hear the criminal trial.</p>
<p>Many legal analysts considered it a crucial factor in the civil trial verdict. Simpson is black; the murder victims were white.</p>
<p>Unlike the criminal trial, which required "proof beyond a reasonable doubt," the plaintiffs in the civil trial only had to prove a 50.1 percent probability -- a "preponderance of the evidence" -- that Simpson committed the murders.</p>
<p>Jurors had to sort through volumes of testimony and choose from some confusing legal options.</p>
<p>They were asked whether Simpson "willfully and wrongfully" caused Goldman's death. They said he did. But they were not asked a comparable question about Nicole Brown Simpson's death -- only whether her ex-husband "battered" her, effectively killing her in the process. Again the answer was yes.</p>
<p>The reason for the distinction: The Goldman family's suit was a wrongful death action that allowed for specific assignment of blame. The suit brought by the Brown family was a "survivorship" claim, which allows the estate of Nicole Brown Simpson to sue only over the attack leading up to her death.</p>
