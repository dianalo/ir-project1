<p>Eric Simons smashed a dynamic 59 not out off just 32 balls to bring Western Province back into the match in the Standard Bank Cup semi-final against Northern Transvaal at Centurion Park.</p>
<p>Simons top scored in the Province total of 215 for seven and masterminded the addition of 66 runs in the last six overs. </p>
<p>He hit successive sixes in the last over of the innings as Northerns captain Mark Davis conceded 20 runs in six deliveries. Simons hit three sixes in all and four fours.</p>
<p>Province had seemed to be squandering first use of a pitch already a day old after rain had forced the abandonment of the first attempt to play the match on Sunday.</p>
<p>In a superb opening burst paceman Steve Elworthy removed Province danger men Herschelle Gibbs (1) and Jacques Kallis (5) to reduce the visitors to 20 for two in the ninth over.</p>
<p>But after being dropped at slip on five H.D. Ackeman righted the ship with 57 off 81 balls with seven boundaries. He put on 60 for the third wicket with Gary Kirsten (27) and 47 for the fifth with Brian McMillan (33).</p>
<p>But when McMillan was run out by a direct hit from long on Province were 149 for six in the 39th over and apparently out of the game. Simons changed all that in six explosive overs.</p>
