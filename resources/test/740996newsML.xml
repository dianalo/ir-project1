<p>Rival Protestant and Catholic enclaves that have known the heartache and horror of guerrilla strife gave a relieved welcome on Saturday to news that the IRA would end hostilities on Sunday.</p>
<p>On Andersonstown Road,  close to the headquarters of the Irish Republican Army's political wing, Sinn Fein, pro-Irish Catholics were in a fulsome summer mood.</p>
<p>But in the Protestant Shankill road, a bastion of continued British rule, the people were glad but doubtful. They had had heard it once before from the IRA in 1994, and that truce lasted barely 18 months, they said.</p>
<p>"Happy days" laughed Catholic Elizabeth Brennan, wheeling her baby daughter in a buggy at Andersonstown Road in the Catholic West Belfast heartland.</p>
<p>Eleven-month old Sian, an Irish name for an Irish boy, was born in war but would have a first birthday in peace.</p>
<p>Further along at a shopping arcade a diminutive 43-year-old in jeans and sweatshirt was elated. "I am absolutely delighted," said the woman.</p>
<p>She blamed intransigence by the previous Conservative government, which was replaced by Tony Blair's Labour Party in a May election, for the breakdown of an IRA ceasefire in February 1996.</p>
<p>The Conservatives' insistence on "decommissioning" of IRA arms had frittered away the first IRA ceasefire, she said, but now Britain has modifed its demand to the surrender of weapons as the talks progressed.</p>
<p>This time round there was a better chance of greater impetus towards a new political agreement, she reasoned.</p>
<p>"I don't think that Blair's government will be as foolish as the last one," she asserted.</p>
<p>"I think he wants to make a name for himself. He will go down in history and he will be remembered if he solves the Northern Ireland problem."</p>
<p>In the doorway of a taxi-station, unemployed Catholic Billy Skillen was upbeat.</p>
<p>"Everbody knows now that there are not going to be obstacles deliberately set in the way (by Britain). If everybody gets into talks, if they actually sit and talk I don't see why they shouldn't be able to sit and work something out."</p>
<p>In the city centre a Protestant grandfather voiced the concern of many of the pro-British majority who fear that the IRA have not truly gone away as a fighting force.</p>
<p>"They knew they had to get on the peace train. But they might engineer something to derail it," he said warily.</p>
<p>On Shankill Road, where British red-white-and-blue flags mirror the national allegiance of its working-class Protestant residents, there was guarded optimism and mixed views.</p>
<p>The IRA killed nine civilians in a bomb blast on the busy thoroughfare in 1993 and 10 months later called a truce that lasted just barely 18 months.</p>
<p>"Is it a ceasefire?" said Elizabeth Douglas quizzically.</p>
<p>"Well if it's for real, I'm glad because the people need it" chipped in her friend Belle Kernaghan.</p>
<p>"Well, I'll second that," said Douglas. "But with all that's happened we have our doubts."</p>
<p>The middle-aged friends, hair coiffed and dressed in their summer best were out shopping, just like the Catholics of Andersonstown, as the hours ticked away towards Sunday's noon deadline for an end to the IRA war against Britain.</p>
<p>The two Protestant woman felt that their Unionist politicians, who have even deeper suspicions of the IRA's motives, should get involved in talks with Sinn Fein, the Irish guerrillas' political wing, even if the Unionists don't want to.</p>
<p>"They're not paid to stay out, they're paid to go in and do their job," one of them said.</p>
<p>Across the road elderly Protestant Reggie Dundas, his face burnished by a rare Belfast sun, said he hoped that the ceasefire would lead to progress.</p>
<p>"Let's hope it's gonna work for everybody's sake so that we can get on with our lives and get back to normal again...They're gonna have to talks sometime."</p>
<p>But the woman he was speaking to said Unionist leaders should shun contact with Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, who was elected to the British House of Commons in May.</p>
<p>"I personally don't think so, because I personally think Gerry Adams has something to do with the IRA...</p>
<p>"But the only way they are going to get anywhere is to talk," countered Dundas.</p>
