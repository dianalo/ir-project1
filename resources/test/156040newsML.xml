<p>The Polish foreign trade ministry refused to grant a permit for duty-free car part imports to the joint venture between the Universal trader and South Korea's Hyundai Corp., Universal said on Thursday.</p>
<p>It said in a statement it would use all legal means to change the ministry's decision, but did not elaborate and Universal officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The permit, required by a recent regulation, is necessary to import duty-free car parts for car assemby.</p>
<p>Earlier the industry ministry recommended to the foreign trade ministry to deny Universal the permit, saying the firm's Pultusk factory near Warsaw did not fulfil the requirements of a car assembly plant.</p>
<p>Universal earlier said that if it is not granted a permit it could build a fully-fledged car factory in the place of the assembling centre in Pultusk. The imports of duty-free car parts for factories are guided by different regulations.</p>
