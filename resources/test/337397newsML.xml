<p>A spectacular bull run on the Slovenian stock market shows no signs of ending as animated buying from foreign investors has jolted domestic punters out of hibernation, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, the blue-chip SBI index has been catapulted 37 percent higher -- 3.57 percent on Tuesday alone -- due to spirited demand from foreign investors quick to pick up on value at cheap prices.</p>
<p>"The SBI index could grow by 50 percent this year," said Toni Apollonio, an analyst at bank A banka.</p>
<p>Foreign investment flooded the tiny Alpine republic's fledgling bourse after the Bank of Slovenia ensured it would not impose restrictions on foreign purchases, and after it became clear political policy was in favour of European Union membership, Apollonio added.</p>
<p>Foreign investors have accounted for nearly half of total turnover on the bourse since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Flavour of the month has been drug company Lek, bank SKB, food companies Kolinska and Droga, health resort operator Terme Catez and trader Mercator.</p>
<p>Market analysts see buying fanning out across the board.</p>
<p>"Demand from foreigners will continue to spread out into other large companies that will be listed later in the year, while middle-sized firms may attract some short-term foreign capital," said Vanda Mocnik Kohek, a trader at Bank Austria.</p>
<p>"Demand is so strong and the level of optimism so high that it seems nothing could cause a significant fall in shares in the medium-term," said Danilo Grasic, head of investment at Creditanstalt.</p>
<p>Slovenia was one of the beneficiaires of growing interest in the emerging markets of Central and Eastern Europe, he said.</p>
<p>"The first strong incentive for the market was political stabilisation in Slovenia in the beginning of January as foreigners last year seemed to be taking a wait-and-see stance over the outcome of the general elections," Nina Jarc, a trader at Nova Ljubjanska Bank said.</p>
<p>Following an inconclusive general election on November 10, prime minister-designate Janez Drnovsek of the centre-left Liberal Democrats last Friday formed a government after getting a mandate from parliament at the beginning of January.</p>
<p>The fresh incentive powering the market sky-high at the moment is Slovenia's second largest bank SKB's plan to list global depository receipts (GDRs) on the London stock exchange by mid-February.</p>
<p>The Bank of Slovenia approved the listing last week.</p>
<p>Traders said the listing of newly privatised companies gave another strong stimulus to the market.</p>
<p>"We expect to have some 30 new share listings on the main and over-the-counter markets this year which may raise the capitalisation of listed shares to two billion dollars from the current one billion," said Drasko Veselinovic, chief executive of the Ljubljana bourse.</p>
<p>Petrol trader Istrabenz and drug company Krka, which are expected to attract significant investor interest, will be listed on the OTC market by February 10, while petrol trader Petrol and brewery Pivovarna Union are among firms expected to follow later this year.</p>
