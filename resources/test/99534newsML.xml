<p>Russian tax inspectors have frozen the accounts of two further units of gas monopoly RAO Gazprom, Prime-Tass news agency said on Monday.</p>
<p>It quoted a state tax service official as saying the units, in the Perm region of central Russia and the Komi republic in the north, owed federal and regional authorities about one trillion roubles ($185 million).</p>
<p>No comment was immediately available from Gazprom.</p>
<p>Company chairman Rem Vyakhirev said in a letter to parliament last week that the government had frozen the accounts of Gazprom's major production unit in order to take back tax arrears.</p>
<p>Gazprom admits it owes more than 15 trillion roubles in back taxes but says it is owed more than three times that amount by consumers, including the government.</p>
<p>The report of the latest asset-freezing coincided with the long-awaited details of Gazprom's international share offering.</p>
<p>Lead managers of the offering for Gazprom, the world's biggest gas company, said on Monday the preliminary price for an American Depositary Share would be between $14 and $16. Each ADS represents 10 oridnary shares.</p>
<p>At 1020 GMT Gazprom shares were $0.020 up at $0.350 on the Russian Trading System.</p>
