<p>Analysts on Friday hailed the takeover of DAF Trucks NV by Paccar of the U.S. as an all-important step in securing the future of the Dutch truck maker in a highly competitive European market.</p>
<p>"There is no chance of a DAF collapse now," said Jonathan Storey, director of U.K.-based European Automotive Research.</p>
<p>There had been a question mark hanging over DAF since it emerged in slimmed-down form from a 1993 bankruptcy, he said.</p>
<p>He said DAF's sales volumes were too small for it to survive as an independent company, but the friendly 933 million guilder ($544 million)takeover by Paccar now ruled out another collapse.</p>
<p>DAF Trucks made some 16,600 vehicles at its Eindhoven plant in 1995, and claims a nine percent share of the West European market for trucks heavier than 15 tonnes. As such it lags Mercedes-Benz  DAIG F with an estimated 20 percent market share and Scania  SCVa.ST with 15 percent.</p>
<p>"Paccar has chosen a good time to buy now DAF is more efficient," Storey said.</p>
<p>But Georges Dieng, auto analyst with Credit Lyonnais Securities in Paris, was less upbeat on the timing of the Paccar move.</p>
<p>"DAF is a good takeover target, but we are in a European (truck market) downturn," he said.  </p>
<p>He said truck makers' orders were down 10 to 15 percent, and the situation was unlikely to improve over the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>In the past, the trend had been for European manufacturers to seek a second market in the U.S. in a bid to create synergies in terms of components manufacturing, he said.</p>
<p>"Paccar is effectively doing the reverse...but I see no real synergy in terms of manufacturing a so-called world truck," he said. "Maybe they see it as a possible springboard to moving into markets further away...to getting a slice of the so-called new (eastern) Europe."</p>
<p>But Storey said the Paccar-DAF link-up offered significant scope for long term synergies in the areas of components, engines and axles, which represent a major percentage of a truck's total cost.</p>
<p>"Spreading the higher research and development spend resulting from tighter emissions regulations has been a driving force behind the collaboration between companies such as (Renault's truck division) RVI and (Germany's) MAN," he said.</p>
<p>He said new versions of existing DAF engines offered scope for collaboration with Paccar. "There is also scope to share cab componentry, which used to be quite difficult."</p>
<p>"I see the move as part of the long-term trend towards consolidation in the industry," he said, adding "now DAF is set to stay, the fierce competition on the European truck market looks like continuing unabated."</p>
