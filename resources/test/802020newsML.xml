<p>Bad weather in Romania in recent weeks has damaged 900,000 tonnes of wheat but the Balkan country might still export two million tonnes of wheat from the 1997 crop, Agriculture Minister Dinu Gavrilescu said on Friday.</p>
<p>"A significant part of the 1997 wheat crop has started to germinate due to the bad weather. Our data show there are some 900,000 tonnes of wheat unfit for milling," he said.  </p>
<p>Agriculture Ministry data on Friday showed Romania had taken in 86 percent of its 1997 wheat crop, or 6.3 million tonnes, with average yield on the 2.07 million ha harvested so far amounting to 3,034 kg per ha, slightly higher than initial estimates of 2,963 kg.</p>
<p>"Despite the losses incurred so far, the 1997 wheat crop is good and enough for domestic demand and exports. We estimate a surplus for export of two million tonnes," Gavrilescu said.</p>
<p>The 1997 losses would be significantly reduced as several Middle East companies had offered to buy the damaged wheat, he said, without giving details.</p>
<p>Latest ministry estimates put the the 1997 wheat crop at 6.9 million tonnes, compared with 3.1 million last year.</p>
