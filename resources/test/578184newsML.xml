<title>USA: FDA panel split on Bristol-Myers' Questran.</title>
<headline>FDA panel split on Bristol-Myers' Questran.</headline>

<p>A joint meeting of two U.S. Food and Drug administration advisory panels on Tuesday was evenly split on whether to recommend approval of the Bristol-Myers Squibb cholesterol lowering drug Questran (cholestyramine) for over-the-counter use.</p>
<p>The 5-5 vote, with one abstention, leaves Bristol hanging. The firm was rejected by the same panel in September 1995, and spent the last year and a half conducting and analyzing a study requested by the committees.</p>
<p>Despite that effort, which the panel called "impressive," Chairman Dr. Ralph D'Agostino of Boston University said there was still a "tremendous amount of concern about how this would be operational in the OTC setting."  </p>
<p>The concern was not just about Questran. On an earlier 7-4 vote, the committees said there should not be any OTC treatment for high cholesterol.</p>
<p>The FDA usually follows its panels' advice, but is not bound by the recommendations of the panels.</p>
<p>Bristol argued that availability of an OTC product would motivate more patients to seek treatment.  </p>
<p>Bristol estimated that 50 million Americans have cholesterol levels that fall outside guidelines established by the National Cholesterol Education Committee, and that only six million of them are under a doctor's care. The firm also said that Americans spent $100 million in 1996 on OTC products such as fish oil and garlic that promise to lower cholesterol.</p>
<p>That indicates an awareness of the problem and a desire for a non-prescription product, said Carola Friedman, executive medical director for BMS Products.</p>
<p>But the panel said it still worried that people would not seek the appropriate diagnosis before starting therapy, or stay under a physician's care. They had the same concern in September 1995.</p>
<p>The BMS study attempted to see if consumers would talk with doctors before using Questran, as directed on the label.</p>
<p>The company recruited participants through an ad seeking people concerned that they might have high cholesterol.</p>
<p>Patients were randomized to either make an OTC purchase, or to first see a doctor and then get a prescription.  About 1,600 patients were in the OTC group; 84 percent went first to see the study physician after being given a card with the doctor's name on it.  </p>
<p>Six percent of the group purchased Questran, but did not consult a doctor or use the medication.  Five percent took the drug before seeing a physician, but later consulted with one. Only one percent did not see a doctor at all.</p>
<p>FDA reviewer Steven Auricchia said that the study "addresses each of the major issues raised at the last advisory committee meeting."</p>
<p>But Auricchia added that the "opinion is still divided as to the degree to which these findings are predictive of behavior in a natural setting," noting that most participants were white, middle class, and highly educated.</p>
<p>"I don't think it reflects what life is like," said panelist Jose Francisco Cara of the Henry Ford Hospital.</p>
<p>There were no significant questions about Questran's safety or efficacy. The drug, to be taken if diet or exercise don't lower cholesterol, has been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol levels by 20 to 25 percent. However, the product, a powder mixed in juice or water, is unpleasant tasting, and often causes gastrointestinal side effects such as bloating, nausea, and gas.</p>
<p>Questran can also interfere with absorption of drugs such as digoxin, beta blockers, and some oral diabetes agents.</p>
