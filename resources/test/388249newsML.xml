<p>The 1,158 megawatt (MW) WNP-2 nuclear power unit will operate at 55 percent of capacity until Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) requests additional power, a spokesman said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The federal power marketing agency has since January periodically asked the unit to trim output due to the wide availability of lower-cost hydropower.</p>
<p>"We are holding at that level day-by-day until BPA changes its request," the Washington Public Power Supply System spokesman said.</p>
<p>In addition, the unit's annual refueling outage will likely be moved up from the current April 18 start date because of the abundant hydropower resources, he noted.</p>
<p>BPA has indicated that the outage may begin mid-March or earlier, but final assessment of snowpack and spring runoff patterns is still underway, the spokesman said.</p>
