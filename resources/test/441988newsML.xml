<p>Parma aim to make Internazionale suffer again at their Tardini stadium on Saturday when the teams clash in Serie A with a possible European Cup Champions' League place at stake.</p>
<p>Second-placed Parma are five points behind Juventus and two in front of third-placed Inter, and victory could give them a significant push towards ensuring runners-up spot and a place in next season's Champions' League.</p>
<p>Parma may be helped by Inter's dismal record at the Tardini, a ground where they have never won, managing only two draws and four defeats in six appearances since March 1991, Parma's first season in Serie A.</p>
<p>Inter midfielder Nicola Berti is a former Parma player, born at the nearby town of Salsomaggiore, and he is eager to improve the Inter record at his old club.</p>
<p>"We've got to go there looking for a win.  I never try to play safe, I always want to win...and this Inter is well capable of doing so," he said.</p>
<p>"Sure, Parma are going well but we're in great form and a big surprise cannot be ruled out."</p>
<p>Berti's fighting words are countered by Parma midfielder Dino Baggio, who still believes in his side's title chances.</p>
<p>"Sure, they're a good team and in good form but it's vital for us to win this game. This is our chance to show what we're made of," he said.</p>
<p>Inter, held 0-0 by Juventus last Sunday, come into the game with a full squad and may be tempted to make changes with a view to their UEFA Cup quarter-final second leg tie at home to Belgian side Anderlecht next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Striker Maurizio Ganz, Argentine midfielder Javier Zanetti and defender Fabio Galante may all be rested, being replaced by Marco Branca, Berti and Alessandro Pistone respectively.</p>
<p>Parma will be without suspended Croat midfielder Mario Stanic, leaving Massimo Crippa, Pietro Strada and Argentine Nestor Sensini to join Baggio in midfield.</p>
<p>Winners of eight of their last 10 games, Parma look to Argentine Hernan Crespo and Enrico Chiesa in attack.</p>
