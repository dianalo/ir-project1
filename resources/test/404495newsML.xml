<p>Georgia's Senate has approved a bill to deregulate the state's natural gas industry.</p>
<p>The proposal passed 51-0 in the Senate on Tuesday and now heads to the House.</p>
<p>The measure would dismantle the near-monopoly that Atlanta Gas Light Co has on gas supply and delivery in Georgia. About 75 percent of all natural gas consumed in Gainesville passes thorugh the companies lines.</p>
<p>The only competing gas supply and delivery company in the state is United Cities Gas Co, which serves Columbus and Gainesville.</p>
<p>The bill would allow customers to buy gas from unregulated marketers, who would use Atlanta Gas Light lines to deliver it. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Sonny Perdue, D-Bonaire, said competition should prevent prices from rising much if at all.</p>
<p>In a phone interview Wednesday, Atlanta Gas spokesman Ross Willis praised the measure and agreed it would save money for customers.</p>
<p>"We would have to be complimentary of Senator Perdue for putting together legislation everybody supports," Willis said.</p>
<p>The bill was drafted by a committee made up of consumer advocates, regulators, customers, and Atlanta Gas and its potential competitors. The comittee was created after the Georgia General Assembly defeated a deregulation proposal that Atlanta Gas had supported last year.</p>
<p>Under the new bill, deregulation would begin when one-third of the residential market is served by at least five gas marketing companeis, so long as companies owned by Atlanta Gas do not hold more than 18 percent.</p>
<p>When marketers gain that one-third share, the state's Public Service Commission would allocate the remaining two-thirds of the market in the same proportion as companies gained in the first third. The commission would then stop setting prices.</p>
<p>The bill prevents gas marketers from "cherry-picking" the most profitable customers, the industrials, by limiting each one's share of the industrial market to the same share it holds in the residential and small business market.</p>
<p>The Public Service Commission would authorize companies to do business in Georgia, and would have the authority to step in and re-regulate the industry if competition fails to keep prices in check.</p>
<p>The bill exempts municipal gas companies.</p>
