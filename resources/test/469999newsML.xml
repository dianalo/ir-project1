<p>British fashion retailer Next Plc on Wednesday reported strongly higher profits for last year and made positive noises about current trading, boosting its shares and dragging other key retail stocks along in its wake.</p>
<p>Next, the first major British clothing retailer to report 1996 results, delivered strong current sales for both retail and mail order and profits which showed no sign of any slowdown after five years of growth.</p>
<p>Pretax profits rose to 158.8 million pounds ($257  million) in the year to February 1, from 141.9 million the year before, and a total dividend of 15 pence per share, up from 11.75 pence. Trading profit before tax was up 25 percent to 156.1 million pounds. Sales increased 22 percent to 947 million pounds.</p>
<p>Chief executive David Jones said the group's current trading, with overall sales up 24 percent since the beginning of February, boded well for the year ahead.</p>
<p>"We're quite relaxed about the prospects for the coming year, we have a very good brand, a very good formula," he said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Next's shares bounded ahead on the figures and the confident trading statement and stood 27 pence, or 4.5 percent, higher at 623 pence, outpacing the FTSE 100 index which had risen by 1.1 percent. The shares traded at just 58 pence back in January 1992.</p>
<p>"They were a good set of figures," said one retail industry analyst, who said he was in the process of adding about 10 million pounds to his current year profit forecast of 178 million.</p>
<p>Other leading retail stocks also moved higher, including Great Universal Stores Plc and Marks &amp; Spencer Plc.</p>
<p>GUS, the UK market leader in home shopping, was a particular beneficiary of the Next results, which showed strong trading in its catalogue operations.</p>
<p>"One swallow doesn't make a summer but because one name in the High Street is doing well it has brought about some interest across the sector," said another dealer.</p>
<p>Jones said shoppers remained very choosy about where they spent their money, but Next was doing well because it was offering good value and good quality.</p>
<p>"I don't think people are roaming the High Street and spending huge sums of money...I think they are being very particular about where they spend (it)."</p>
<p>Jones said Next would continue to invest its sizeable cash surplus in the business, including personal loans, its Next Directory credit business and stock.</p>
<p>There were no plans for major acquisitions. "I have no grand designs," Jones said.</p>
<p>He also said there were no plans for any tie-up with GUS, whose chairman Lord Wolfson of Sunningdale is also chairman of Next. Jones said there was no conflict of interest in Wolfson's position as chairman of both companies.</p>
<p>The group opened 21 new stores over the year and extended seven of its existing stores last year, while closing seven. It plans to add approximately 75,000 square feet of selling spare in 1997.</p>
<p>Jones said the situation with Next's four stores in the United States was improving and the group was looking at replacing one of them with a better site, but had no plans for major expansion.</p>
<p>"Our policy in America is to keep working at it...but I mean we're not going to go mad and invest a huge amount of money until such time as we're absolutely certain it's the right thing to do."</p>
<p>The group has 30 franchise stores in Europe, the Far East and the Middle East and hopes to open another 15 this year.</p>
