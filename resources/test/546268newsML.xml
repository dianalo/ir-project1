<p>The Nigerian stock market's all-share index fell for the second day running on Tuesday on an adjustment of leading Bank First Bank, dealers said.</p>
<p>The index closed at 8780.05 from 8780.07 on Monday.</p>
<p>First Bank fell 4.49 naira following its adjustment for a 56 kobo dividend and a one-for-four scrip issue announced on Monday. The fourth largest bank, Afribank, also went down 50 kobo to 9.50 naira, but on speculative trading, while newly-listed Guaranty Trust Bank rose 20 kobo to 11.45 naira.  </p>
<p>Highly-priced oil marketer Unipetrol fell 50 kobo on Tuesday, after losing 2.10 naira on Monday, in its first big drop this year. It closed at 73.50 naira.</p>
<p>"To me that's good news," dealer Azubuike Okpalaoka of TRW Stockbrokers said, adding that the stock would probably fall further on profit-taking and also because the government, which has controlling shares in it has not named a board to run it for almost one year.</p>
<p>"How can you put your money in a company run by one man?," he said.</p>
<p>Fellow oil products marketer Texaco was on the rise again, closing at 46.25 naira, up 25 kobo. Mobil added 10 kobo to 61.30 naira. But Agip dropped one kobo, the same as on Monday, to end at 26.48 naira.</p>
<p>Tuesday's other big loser was healthcare firm Smithkline Beecham, down 10 kobo at 6.50 naira. It first fell to 6.40 naira, but regained 10 kobo in a rally.</p>
<p>Rising demand saw Seven-Up Bottling Co  add two kobo to 2.40 naira, while Coca-Cola bottler Nigerian Bottling Co finished unchanged at 57.50 naira.</p>
