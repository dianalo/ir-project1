<p>Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing Co. Friday said earnings rose 16 percent in the third quarter, fuelled by strong international sales, especially in Japan, other parts of Asia and Latin America.</p>
<p>The results from the maker of tapes, adhesives, coatings and films beat expectations on Wall Street, and its stock rose $1.625 to $72.875 on the New York Stock Exchange. 3M is one of the issues in the 30-share Dow Jones industrial average.</p>
<p>St. Paul, Minn.-based 3M said net profits rose to $398 million, or 95 cents a share, in the quarter, from $344 million, or 82 cents a share, in the 1995 period, which included earnings of $5 million, or 1 cent a share, from discontined operations.</p>
<p>Sales grew 7 percent to $3.62 billion from $3.37 billion.</p>
<p>The results surpassed analysts' average forecasts of 93 cents a share, according to First Call, which tracks estimates.</p>
<p>The company said unit sales rose about 10 to 12 percent internationally and more than 7 percent in the United States.</p>
<p>"A strong flow of innovative, high-impact new products, an intense focus on customer satisfaction and continued expansion internationally fuelled our worldwide volume growth," Chairman L.D. DeSimone said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company's units in Japan, elsewhere in Asia, Latin America and Canada posted double-digit volume increases in the quarter while unit sales in Europe grew 7 percent, despite sluggish economies in many major European countries.</p>
<p>For the nine months, net income grew 6 percent to $1.14 billion, or $2.73 a share, as sales rose 4 percent to $10.61 billion.</p>
