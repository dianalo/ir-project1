<p>The Zimbabwe dollar was quoted easier against major currencies at  the close of Wednesday's interbank session on the back of slight import pressure, dealers said.</p>
<p>"I think think there was a payment going out today and the dollar went down about two cents. The central (Reserve) bank was selling U.S. dollars in the market but it wasn't enough to offset the pressure," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The local unit closed at 11.6700/6800 on the U.S. currency from its 11.6350/6450 close last Friday and was also quoted softer versus sterling at 18.3860/4080 compared to 18.3200/3700.</p>
<p>Against the mark it was at 6.3200/3290 from 6.2500/2600 and was at 2.5020/5050 on the rand from 2.4800/4900.</p>
