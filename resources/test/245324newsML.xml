<p>The U.S. General Accounting Office has rejected objections to the award of an airport surveillance radar contract to Raytheon Electronic Systems, the company said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Air Force's Material Command Electronic Systems Center awarded the contract to Raytheon's electronic systems unit in August.</p>
<p>The deal, with a potential value of $619.9 million, calls for the delivery of 213 digital radar units through 2007, the company said.  </p>
<p>The award was challenged by other companies that bid for the contract, including Northrop Grumman Corp, Raytheon said.</p>
<p>"Raytheon's DASR will provide key air traffic services at DoD (Department of Defense) and FAA (Federal Aviation Association) airports," William Swanson, Raytheon executive vice president and general manager of Raytheon Electronic Systems, said.</p>
<p>The preproduction contract for $20 million called for the delivery of up to three airport surveillance radars. It also involved the development of interfaces to existing automation systems, performing design qualification tests, and supporting government test and evaluation, Raytheon said.</p>
<p>DASR provides primary radar surveillance of aircraft to an instrumented range of 60 nautical miles and secondary radar coverage up to 120 nautical miles, the company said.</p>
