<p>Better economic growth in the years ahead will allow France to cut its public deficit below three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) without harsher austerity, Budget Minister Alain Lamassoure said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, Lamassoure said public deficits would be cut to three percent of GDP in time to qualify for European economic and monetary union (EMU) and that France would then go further to ensure sound financial management.</p>
<p>Lamassoure's comments amounted to a pledge to continue the centre-right government's policies of moderate rigour and gradual deficit cuts.</p>
<p>Speaking as France nears parliamentary elections set for May 25, with a second and final round on June 1, he said these deficit cuts would strengthen growth and consequently boost job creation.</p>
<p>The opposition Socialists have accused the centre-right of planning five more years of austerity and a turn towards "harsh capitalism" if returned to power.</p>
<p>"We must not only reach three percent as quickly as possible, but (we must) go below as quickly as possible because, contrary to what is said, three percent is not at all a rigorous target," Lamassoure said.</p>
<p>"It must be understood that as long as we are not at two percent we will be forced to finance part of our operating expenditures, including civil servants' salaries and pensions, through debt."</p>
<p>He said a new bout of harsh austerity would not be needed to reach two percent because economic growth of between 2.5 and three percent would compensate for budgetary restraint.</p>
<p>"This will be done in the context of returned economic growth," he said.</p>
<p>Lamassoure said the government would redistribute the fruits of recent austerity and pursue tax cuts as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"What we are saying to the French is we will immediately redistribute the dividends of this collective effort and we will redistribute them through lowering income taxes and cutting payroll charges on low salaries," he said.</p>
<p>Lamassoure said the best way for France to attack its record 12.8 percent unemployment was to maintain 2.5 to 3.0 percent growth, a pace of growth that would allow the economy to create more jobs than it shed.</p>
<p>"What I can say for certain is that if we maintain a level of growth on the order of 2.5 to 3.0 percent for the next five years we will have a very strong drop in unemployment," he said. "Growth is the key to employment."</p>
<p>Lamassoure said the budget deficit was lower at the end of April than at the same time last year, tax receipts were running as expected and the social security deficit would be held to about 35 billion francs.</p>
<p>"For the time being we are pretty confident that we will not have to put in place any quick plan to cut spending," he said. "State finances are under control. We have no worries for the 1997 budget."</p>
<p>He said the freeze earlier this year of an extra 10 billion francs in spending would be enough to hold to budget targets.</p>
<p>The government's first priority in the 1998 budget would be to find a replacement for the 37.5 billion francs paid to the state by France Telecom, which helped the government cut its deficit to 4.2 percent of GDP in 1996.</p>
<p>He said it was too early for him to speculate about where the money could be found.</p>
