<p>The Indian rupee ended up at 35.8625/8675 against the dollar on Monday after touching a day's high of 35.885 as dollar demand weakened, dealers said.</p>
<p>The day saw normal dollar supplies, they said.</p>
<p>A leading Calcutta-based bank was bidding for dollars from morning. "He bought at 35.8850 level and brought it down by half a paise each time to 35.8650," said a dealer.</p>
<p>The forward dollar premia rose from weekend levels on the back on a spurt in overnight call rates, dealers said.</p>
<p>The six-month annualised forward premium closed at 7.36 percent, down from Friday's closing rate of 7.19 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers reported good demand for March delivery dollars.</p>
