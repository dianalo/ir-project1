<p>A bushfire near the west Australian city of Perth has forced the evacuation of hundreds of people from their homes and a prison, razed buildings and destroyed forest and farmland.</p>
<p>Firemen have contained the blaze about 60 km (38 miles) east of Perth but a Bush Fires Board spokesman told Reuters on Saturday it would be at least another three days before the area could be declared safe.</p>
<p>"There is a heck of a lot of work to be done today," said Nobby McManus, the board's duty officer.</p>
<p>"We are hoping to take advantage of better weather conditions," he added.</p>
<p>McManus did not say what caused the fire, which broke out on Friday afternoon, spreading quickly in hot and windy conditions.</p>
<p>The fire destroyed about 105 square kilometres (40 square miles) of forest and farmland, he said.</p>
<p>About 150 prisoners at Wooroloo Prison Farm and 300 workers at a nearby abattoir were evacuated. Hundreds of residents of the community of Wundowie were also evacuated and spent the night in a local hall.</p>
<p>Perth has experienced its hottest New Year on record this year with temperatures ranging from 42 degrees Celsius (108 degrees Fahrenheit) on January 1 to 39 degrees Celsius on Friday.</p>
