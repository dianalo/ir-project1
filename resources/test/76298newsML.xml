<p>The latest turmoil over Europe in Britain's Conservative party could presage the break-up of the ruling party, Paddy Ashdown, leader of the minority Liberal Democrats, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"I've no doubt whatsoever that this is the clearest sign of the pre-shocks of the earthquake that breaks the Tories up -- probably in defeat after the next election," he told BBC radio from Brighton where his party is holding its annual conference.</p>
<p>Ashdown said it was unlikely that the latest infighting would bring down Prime Minister John Major.</p>
<p>But he added: "I've no doubt whatsoever that this is a clear sign of a government in terminal disarray. I've no doubt whatsoever that when No 11 and No 10 Downing Street can't agree, the government has got no further helpful function to perform for Britain."</p>
