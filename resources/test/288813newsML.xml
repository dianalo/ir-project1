<p>Police launched raids on Corsican nationalists on Monday but detained just one person after most suspects were apparently tipped off by leaks, sources close to the police said.</p>
<p>Police said they found no weapons, bomb-making equipment or illegal documents in the swoops in Balagne in the northwest of the French Mediterranean island. One person was kept in custody and a few others were freed after brief detentions.</p>
<p>The raids were aimed at members of Cuncolta Naziunalista, the legal wing of the banned Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC), the sources said. Those targeted seemed to have had known in advance of the planned raids.</p>
<p>Hardline Corsican separatists have recently stepped up their 20-year-campaign for greater autonomy from mainland France with a spate of mostly night-time bombings and machine-gunnings of government buildings or police stations on the island.</p>
<p>Francois Santoni, head of Cuncolta Naziunalista, and his lawyer girlfriend Marie-Helene Mattei were placed under investigation last month for attempted extortion, complicity in bomb attacks and membership of a terrorist organisation.</p>
