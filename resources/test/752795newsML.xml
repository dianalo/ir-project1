<p>Asia's crude market saw active trading on Middle East grades, as Asian refiners started to cover September requirements, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>September Oman was heard traded twice, to a major at Dubai quotes +3 cents per barrel and to a Japanese at Dubai +5.  </p>
<p>A western trader heard sold Oman to a South Korean refiner at Dubai +5, but this was in exchange for a cargo of Dubai crude with a price differential of 20 cents between the grades.</p>
<p>A September Qatar Marine was heard sold by a western trader to a U.S. major, but the price level was uncertain, heard by some traders as Dubai +5 and others as Dubai +10.</p>
<p>There was very little talk of where prices would be on an OSP, although Oman bids were expected to come from MPM -25/-35.</p>
<p>Traders said buyers assessed it economic to pay the low premiums over Dubai quotes for grades that are much higher in quality than Dubai crude.  </p>
<p>A late August cargo of Murban was also sold by a western trader to Kenya.</p>
<p>The price level was a premium of 67 cents over the September ADNOC price, on a cost and freight (c+f) basis.</p>
<p>China heard bought a 950,000 barrel cargo of August Escalante crude from a trader at WTI -$2.80 c+f China.</p>
<p>This is the only the third cargo of Escalante crude that China has bought, following its very first purchase in June.</p>
<p>Trading on the light Asian crudes was quiet, with September sellers offering higher levels compared to August.</p>
