<p>Australian bonds yields spiked higher in early trading on Friday reflecting pre-weekend profit-taking after the strong rally over the past two days and amid concerns over the New Zealand market.</p>
<p>"The kiwi market is getting smashed. While that could generate some switching activity, at the moment the market is concerned about a spillover to here," one trader said.</p>
<p>The New Zealand dollar dropped one U.S. cent to a 19-month low as a large U.S. hedge fund hit the market, prompting a sharp rise in debt yields in attempt to bring monetary conditions to the RBNZ's desired level.  </p>
<p>A softer bias in U.S. Treasuries also weighed on the market.</p>
<p>However, traders said any local sell-off is likely to be restrained with the market underpinned by expectations of a benign outcome to next week's second quarter inflation data.</p>
<p>The September 10-year bond futures contract had struck a new 3-1/2 year high of 93.510 in after hours trading, nearing the all time high of 93.630, before the market slithered back.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, former Reserve Bank governor Bernie Fraser is due to address a conference in Melbourne about 1.40 p.m. (0340 GMT) and the market will be closely watching for any mention of current monetary conditions.  </p>

<p> AUD VS   3-YR	   10-YR	* AUD 3-YR/10-YR SPREAD</p>

<p> NZD     -131 (- 15)   -16 (- 06) *</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The local market underperformed against both the U.S. and Canada, but spreads tightened to a weak N.Z. market. Profit-taking in the U.S. stunted an early advance, while the Canadian market was hit by a fall in the Canadian dollar.  </p>
