<p>Term loans accounted for less than half the trade, their rates mostly unchanged.</p>
<p>Insurers rolled over their previous call money and one-week loans at a steady 9.0 percent rate.</p>
<p>Bankers charged 10 and 11 percent for one-week money and prolonged one- and two-month deals at 15 and 18 percent respectively.</p>
<p>The central bank calculated its kuna midrates for Thursday firmer at 3.5662 against the German mark and at 6.1367 aginst the dollar. -- Metka Jelenc, Zagreb Newsroom, 385 1 4557075</p>
