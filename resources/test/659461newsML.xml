<p>As the battle over repealing the "de minimis" exemption escalates, 18 U.S. Senators on Friday urged the Clinton Administration to back off of its endorsement of the roll back.</p>
<p>"Although intended to target corporations, this measure could actually punish state and local governments and limit their abillity to raise capital in the tax-exempt market," the senators warned in a two-page letter to Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.</p>
<p>The Clinton Administration earlier this year called for repeal of the rule.</p>
<p>The House Ways and Means Committee early Friday approved a broad tax plan that would scale back considerably the de minimis exemption.</p>
<p>The Senate Finance Committee, meanwhile, is expected to begin voting on a tax package June 19. Panel Chairman William Roth, R-Del., has not stated publicly whether a preliminary bill will seek de minimis rule repeal.</p>
<p>Among the bipartisan group of senators signing Friday's letter were Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; Christopher Dodd, D-Conn.; and Max Baucus, D-Montana.</p>
