<p>Norwegian shares finished higher on Tuesday but trade was dull and many players had started the Easter holidays early, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Total index closed 0.73 percent up at 1,072.73 points in turnover of just 540 million crowns. The bourse will close at 1200 GMT on Wednesday for Easter.</p>
<p>"Volume is thin, pushing prices upwards artificially," one dealer said. "There is the Easter holidays, but people are also waiting for the Federal Reserve tonight. You know interest rates will go up but you are not sure by how much," he said.  </p>
<p>Insurer Storebrand gained 2.71 percent to close at 45.40 crowns after investment group Tiger Management said 35,482,388 Storebrand shares would be transferred from the MLI/SFG omnibus account to Tiger's voting accounts.</p>
<p>A Storebrand spokesman said Tiger, a major shareholder, was shifting its stake to be able to vote at the annual general meeting next month.</p>
<p>Metals maker Elkem was up 3.77 percent at 124 crowns. "Foreign investors are buying cyclical shares in Norway now so Elkem is attractive to them," one dealer said.</p>
