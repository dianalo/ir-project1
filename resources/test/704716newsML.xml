<p>Maintenance work on the Panama Canal will start next Monday and last for 13 days but will not disrupt traffic, the Panama Canal Commission (PCC) said Thursday.</p>
<p>"The Panama Canal Commission will begin a planned, 13-day overhaul at Miraflores locks beginning just after midnight on Monday, July 7," the PCC said in a statement.</p>
<p>"No undue traffic delay is anticipated," a PCC spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>PCC added that the maintenance and improvement work required the dewatering of the west lane at Miraflores and included the overhauling of two miter gates. The PCC would also rehabilitate 700 feet of towing locomotive track and six removable track sections.</p>
<p>"A simultaneous, 10-day lane outage at Gatun Locks between July 7 and 16 will allow eight days of work to be performed on the Gatum east land and an additional two days of work on the west lane," the statement said. PCC added that the planned overhaul included repairing tow tracks.</p>
<p>"To ensure that the Canal is operating at its most efficient transit capacity during the lane outage, 24-hour vessel relay operations will be conducted in the lanes opposite the outage. Both lanes at Pedro Miguel Locks will be in the service throughout this period," the statement said.</p>
