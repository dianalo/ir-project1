<p>When Wang Dan's new prison term finishes in 2007, the shy, democracy activist will have spent nearly all of his adult life in jail for his defiance of China's communist rulers.</p>
<p>A Chinese court took less than four hours on Wednesday to convict the former student leader of plotting to overthrow the government, sentencing him to 11 years in prison and depriving him of his political rights for a further two years.</p>
<p>Wang, 27, is no stranger to China's jail cells.</p>
<p>As a former physics student at Beijing University, one of China's most elite schools, Wang began his political life by inviting speakers to address informal discussion "salons" on campus and went on to found the Beijing Autonomous Students' Federation during the 1989 demonstrations for more democracy.</p>
<p>That move put Wang, then 21, at the top of a nationwide most-wanted list after troops crushed the protests on June 3-4, 1989, with heavy loss of life.</p>
<p>Arrested, held for several months in the notorious Qincheng prison on the outskirts of Beijing and convicted of counter-revolutionary crimes, or subversion, Wang spent four years in prison.</p>
<p>He was finally paroled in February 1993, four months before his sentence was due to expire, and at a politically sensitive time -- on the eve of a visit by U.S. administration officials and another by an inspection team from the International Olympic Committee to review China's bid to hold the 2000 games.</p>
<p>However, that first sentence failed to crush Wang's fighting spirit.</p>
<p>Within months of his release he had resumed his political activities, defying persistent police surveillance and harassment to organise political meetings and speak out against Chinese human rights abuses.</p>
<p>In a meeting with one foreign reporter after his parole, Wang said he had not given up his drive for more democracy and said he had a book project in the works.</p>
<p>His defiance resulted detentions on several occasions in the next two years. Police questioned him about his activities but on each occasion finally released him.</p>
<p>However, his detention in May 1995 after joining a daring appeal to communist leaders for the release of those still jailed for their part in the 1989 protests marked the end of a brief period of troubled freedom.</p>
<p>He was not formally charged until last month -- more than 17 months after he was detained.</p>
<p>Many had seen a prison sentence as virtually inevitable after a Beijing court in December 1995 convicted Wei Jingsheng, father of China's tiny, struggling democracy movement, to 14 years in jail on a similar charge of plotting to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>The court verdict against Wei, who was jailed for 15 years after his daring 1979 demand for democracy in China, had also implicated Wang.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the only delay in bringing Wang to trial would have been caused by difficulties in collecting sufficient evidence to convict the young man.</p>
<p>Wang's defiance continued in detention, when he staged a brief hunger strike, and even after his conviction on Wednesday he told his family that he would appeal against the prison term.</p>
<p>Wang's mother had said he had been mentally prepared for a long sentence but said her son's health had deteriorated since he last tasted freedom in May 1995.</p>
<p>Wang's mother, a 61-year old museum researcher who has no background in law, attended the trial as one of two defence lawyers.</p>
