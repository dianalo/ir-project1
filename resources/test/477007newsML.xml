<title>USA: Ban on same sex marriages to become law in Maine.</title>
<headline>Ban on same sex marriages to become law in Maine.</headline>
<dateline>AUGUSTA, Maine 1997-03-31</dateline>

<p>Gov. Angus King said Monday he will not veto a citizen-initiated ban on same sex marriages, although he believed it was not needed and unconstitutional.</p>
<p>King said he will allow the measure approved by the state Legislature to become law without his signature. A veto would have required Maine voters to decide the issue in a referendum in November.</p>
<p>"I believe that this bill has very little to do with marriage and nothing to do with love," said King, who accused the measure's sponsors of trying "to stir fears and ancient prejudices."</p>
<p>The ban was proposed by Concerned Maine Families which collected more than 60,000 signatures to put the measure on the ballot. Under Maine law, legislators can avoid holding an election by enacting the measure directly into law.</p>
<p>King said he wanted to avoid a "bitter and divisive referendum campaign." Gay rights activists had cited the same concern in waging only a limited fight against legislative approval of the bill.</p>
<p>A court challenge to the ban is expected. King said he believed the law will likely be found unconstitutional and "fall of its own discriminatory weight." Seventeen states have similar bans.</p>
<p>Maine voters in 1995 defeated an anti-gay rights referendum sponsored by Concerned Maine Families. Lawmakers were scheduled to debate gay rights legislation this session and King has indicated he will sign the bill.</p>
