<p>Finnish yields have already bottomed this year, Danish Unibank said in its weekly report published on Monday.</p>
<p>"We believe that Finnish yields have already bottomed this year and do not expect a return to the previous strong levels," Unibank said.</p>
<p>Unibank said it expected Finland to be among the first to join the third stage of European economic and monetary union (EMU) and therefore, the Finnish currency and bond markets would be affected by the mounting uncertainty over the start of EMU.</p>
<p>"Even though the international trend towards higher FRA rates and higher shorter rates has spilled over to the Finnish market, Finland has performed well relative to the other Nordic markets," it said.</p>
<p>Unibank said it maintained its recommendation to sell Finnish FRA's against Danish equivalents.</p>
<p>It expected the yield curve to flatten this week following a period of uncertainty in the Nordic markets.</p>
