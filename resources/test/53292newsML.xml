<headline>Troy, NY bondholders to waive payment due Sept 15.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-13</dateline>
<text>
<p>Troy, New York, which a rating agency has said was at risk of default, on Friday said that it expects its bondholders to waive a $1.4 million payment due on September 15.</p>
<p>Further, the city's budget director, Owen Goldfarb, said he expects to reach a final agreement with the bondholders, which are three mutual funds, as soon as Monday.  </p>
<p>"We have reached an agreement in concept with the bondholders, we are running the numbers over the weekend, and we hope to make an announcement early next week," he said.</p>
<p>Troy, whose debt service for 1996 in January totaled more than $9 million or 25 percent of its annual expenses, has said its reserve account does not have the money to make the $1.4 million payment due September 15 on $35 million of debt.</p>
<p>Troy since 1995 has been under the control of a state-imposed Municipal Assistance Corp, which handles its debt offerings, as it has been unable to sell debt on its own.  </p>
<p>The Municipal Assistance Corp is expected to issue new debt for the city to refinance $35 million of debt issued under a lease back mortgage arrangement.</p>
<p>How high an interest rate the new debt will bear has been one of the thorny issues during the talks between Troy and its bondholders, sources close to the talks said, noting it now pays 8.8 percent due to the present deal's unusual structure.</p>
<p>While an agreement with the bondholders, which are three mutual funds, is a step forward that likely will prompt at least one rating agency to review its analysis of the city's financing, Troy still appears to have some work ahead of it.  </p>
<p>Saying this was a renegotiation under the threat of a default, Brad Gewehr, an assistant director at Moody's Investors Service, added:</p>
<p>"From our analytic standpoint the fundamental point is that it doesn't materially change the credit implications or the analytical implications of Troy's ability to honor its debt." Moody's has given Troy's general obligation debt a rating of single-B.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall, said that his staff has been closely monitoring the talks between Troy and its bondholders. "The comptroller has long supported the city's efforts to refinance its staggering debt and remains hopeful that a mutually agreed plan will be reached soon."</p>
<p>In July, the city's long-term obligations totaled around $90 million. The owners of the $35 million debt that was issued in 1992 are three mutal funds, Oppenheimer, the Franklin Fund and Van Kampen Fund.</p>
<p>Another Moody's analyst said that Troy's difficulties were an unusual event in the leaseback arena.</p>
<p>"This is a huge market, and it's viable and cost-effective, it's been around for 30 years, and for the most part it works extremely well," said Kathy McManus, an assistant director.</p>
<p>"There have been very few defaults," she added.</p>
