<p>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) chairman Alan Fels said on Thursday he would be likely to approve a takeover of one of the big four banks by a major insurance company.</p>
<p>"I could see it as being quite likely to increase competition with the entry into banking of a new significant force with a broad range of product offerings across the financial services sector," Fels told Australian Broadcasting Corp Radio on Thursday.</p>
<p>"So we would probably start from a position that there's a fair chance that that would be acceptable," Fels said.  </p>
<p>"But we would certainly look at it carefully because it would create a fairly powerful new institution."</p>
<p>The ACCC is Australia's anti-monopoly watchdog.</p>
<p>The government-commissioned Wallis report into the financial sector recommended the end of the "six-pillar" policy between Australia's four major banks and two biggest life insurers.</p>
<p>But Treasurer Peter Costello said the government would not allow mergers at this time among Australia's big four banks -- National Australia Bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia,  Westpac Banking Corp and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  </p>
<p>The two big life offices are the AMP Society and National Mutual Holdings Ltd.</p>
