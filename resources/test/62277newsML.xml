<p>Following are comments from U.S. economists after the Commerce Department reported the July international trade gap swelled to $11.68 billion, the widest since the monthly average of $12.9 billion in the fourth quarter of 1987.</p>
<p>Economists in a Reuters poll had expected an $8.8 billion deficit.</p>
<p>ALAN RUSKIN, INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIST, I.D.E.A. INC: "There's no question that this is going to be seen as a dollar negative number."  </p>
<p>Speaking on Reuters Financial Television, Ruskin continued: "I personally have some doubts about some of these numbers, particularly on the exports side ... I think we'll see a sharp rebound in exports come August and September."</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER LOW, SENIOR ECONOMIST, HSBC MARKETS: "The deficit is enormous. It's the largest since January 1992 when the series originated. Surprisingly, this is not built on a strong domestic economy. In fact, imports are only up 1.2 percent, just about reflecting the increase in oil prices. Exports were hammered. They were generally expected to improve."  </p>
<p>Seto went on: "We are also going through a period in July where inventories have become fairly lean, and we may be beginning to see more imports flow back into the United States."</p>
<p>MICHAEL STRAUSS, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF ECONOMIST, YAMAICHI INTERNATIONAL (AMERICA) INC: "It's a little bit better than expected for the (Treasury) market in the sense that the weakness in exports was a surprise.</p>
<p>"The question going forward is, is it sustainable? Probably not. There are certain export components we know will be strong, such as aircraft, which don't really show up in today's data."  </p>
<p>Strauss added: "Japan's numbers bounced back, but China is our trade problem on a forward-looking basis. If you look at the growth rate of our trade deficit with China, it's scary.</p>
<p>"There were some distortions (in the report) that were a bit of a surprise. The trade gap with Western Europe shot up to levels that we haven't seen before. There may be a bit of a quirk in the number."  </p>
<p>WALDO BEST, SENIOR ECONOMIST, BZW SECURITIES INC: "Aircraft and exports were down $686 million dollars. I think most people hadn't assumed some type of an increase in exports because Boeing (Co) had an incredible surge in orders over the past six months. We don't know where they (the Boeing orders) are going to actually hit this report, but somewhere in here some of these orders have to hit.</p>
<p>"The import miss was largely due to oil going up from $18 to $18.25 a barrel, so you had a $280 million miss by the Street on oil imports.</p>
<p>"Both of those factors are like shocks meaning that they're likely to partially reverse themselves in the months ahead, so this widening by so much that surprised the Street isn't likely to continue in next month's report.</p>
<p>"The aircraft export is probably going to reverse itself out and the import story is not going to happen again because a lot of that was due to an increase in oil prices. So, you're looking at about a $2 billion dollar reversal on this number."</p>
