<p>Spain's Economy Ministry forecasts that private consumption will continue to pick up in the coming months, according to its latest economic report.</p>
<p>The 1997 budget and the pensions agreement between the government and the trade unions will improve consumer confidence, it said.</p>
<p>A two point fall in the consumer confidence indicator in the third quarter "introduces some uncertainty about the pace of the recovery in consumption in the last months of the year."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, "a recovery in this indicator can be expected following the presentation of the budget and the pension pact," the report said.</p>
<p>A 1.9 percent year-on-year increase in gross domestic product in the second quarter confirmed that economic activity "is in a new upward trend after a deceleration in 1995."</p>
<p>The report highlighted the recent performance of industrial output and industrial climate indicators as evidence of this trend.</p>
