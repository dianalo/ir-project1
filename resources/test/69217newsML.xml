<p>Armenians, hoping for a better life after five hard years of independence, voted on Sunday in an election pitting President Levon Ter-Petrosyan against his former prime minister in a bid for a new five-year term.</p>
<p>Ter-Petrosyan has led the country through a time of acute economic hardship caused partly by a protracted confrontation with neighbouring Azerbaijan over its largely-Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh.</p>
<p>Voters filed into polling stations in the capital Yerevan in bright sunshine. The 2.4 million electorate in the mountainous Caucasus state sandwiched between Iran, Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey had until 10 p.m.(1800 GMT) to cast ballots.</p>
<p>Ballot papers listed four presidential candidates but only Ter-Petrosyan, an at times aloof academic running for a second and final five years in office, and ex-prime minister Vazgen Manukyan appear to have a realistic chance of winning.</p>
<p>If no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the votes, a second round runoff will be held in two weeks.</p>
<p>Ter-Petrosyan, 51, casting his ballot in central Yerevan, said he was "very encouraged" by his chances and hailed the vote as a milestone in establishing Armenia as a democratic state.</p>
<p>Manukyan, 50, who has made sweeping promises to raise living standards quickly in the impoverished country, predicted victory as he voted at a polling station in the Armenian Writer's Union in the early morning.</p>
<p>"People understand what is happening in the country and they want to live better," he said, accompanied by his wife.</p>
<p>The contest between the two former close allies, both of whom played big roles in leading Armenia to independence from the Soviet union in 1991, has become bitter.</p>
<p>Ter-Petrosyan, who disdains what he calls "election propoganda", has made few promises, focusing on stability, recent economic progress and battlefield victories over neighbouring Azerbaijan in an eight-year war over territory.</p>
<p>But sensing his rival gaining ground, he launched blistering attacks in the closing hours of the campaign saying that a Manukyan presidency would bring "tyranny and chaos".</p>
<p>He said a coalition government proposed by Manukyan would make the country ungovernable and raise the prospect of a civil war, reverse triumphs against the Azeris and threaten the very existence of Armenia as an independent state.</p>
<p>Manukyan has pledged to revive industry and improve the lot of the average person, still hurting from economic collapse brought on by the war and the demise of the Soviet union.</p>
<p>Amrmenia, a country of 3.5 million people, suffered chaos and misery when the Soviet empire began to break up, embroiled in conflict with Azerbaijan over the enclave of Nagorno- Karabakh. Fighting has since been brought to an end by a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Many people are still poor but the economy has begun to recover.</p>
<p>Some voters expressed their preferences after casting ballots in the capital's working-class Sovetskoye district.</p>
<p>"Ter-Petrosyan is a good man and I've supported him for five years. But everyone is so poor now. I haven't had a steady job for five years and neither has my wife," said Ovik Yegezaryan, a 37-year-old father of two who voted for Manukyan.</p>
<p>Orange-haired 70-year old Seda Khachturova, struggling out of the polling station with a cane, backed Ter-Petrosyan in the belief that he represented stability. "He started and let him finish. Why change now?" she said.</p>
<p>Several dozen international observers were on hand to monitor voting. They say they hope to avoid irregularities which marred a parliamentary poll last year.</p>
