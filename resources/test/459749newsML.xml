<p>Transport companies must give a higher priority to better electronic communications systems and Internet-based services, a large German shipper said.</p>
<p>Bernd Mueller, transport manager of Bertelsmann Distribution GmbH, a subsidiary of media giant Bertelsmann, said his company faced problems in trying to distribute throughout Europe.</p>
<p>These included long transport times, high costs and complicated paperwork for non-EU destinations, he said in a speech to the third European courier, express and parcels congress in Bonn.</p>
<p>Shippers wanted value-for-money international parcels distribution and simple documentation with paper-free administration within the EU, he said.</p>
<p>"Paper must disappear. Any (distribution) company using paper will no longer be used by us," he said.</p>
<p>Instead, open computer systems with flexible interfaces and Internet-based tracking and tracing of shipments should be offered by transport companies, Mueller said.</p>
<p>"In my view, it is vital in the express and courier areas that this is done," he told company managers.</p>
<p>Bertelsmann wanted to integrate online tracking and tracing into its client complaint network so that distribution problems could be quickly tackled, he added.</p>
<p>Direct distribution to private clients in Europe was also a requirement which only Deutsche Post and other post offices could meet at present, he noted.</p>
<p>But Mueller forecast: "In 2003 we will have open systems on an Internet/Intranet basis, paperless invoicing and computer-based customs declarations."</p>
<p>Integrated standard transport systems would offer Europe-wide distribution, including to private clients, at value-for-money prices, he added.</p>
<p>Bertelsmann Distribution handled 100,000 consignments a day, including 3,000 export consignments, he said.</p>
<p>The company used currently many operators, including DHL Worldwide Express GmbH, UPS, TNT Worldwide Express, Deutsche Post AG, DPD and German Parcel. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom. Tel+44 171 542 7706; Fax:5017</p>
