<p>Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who U.S. officials say has been treated for cancer at a Washington hospital, appeared in public on Thursday sipping champagne but declined to answer questions about his health.</p>
<p>Appearing before news cameras at the Croatian embassy to promote the U.S. edition of his 1989 book about the Second World War, "The Horrors of War", Tudjman was asked what the results of his hospital treatment here were.</p>
<p>"You are seeing me, aren't you," he said with a smile as champagne was passed round to celebrate the book launch.</p>
<p>Croatian officials have said only that Tudjman, who is due to return home on Friday, is suffering from "digestion problems".</p>
<p>State Department officials said last week the 74-year-old president, a key player in the collapse of Yugoslavia into conflict and in the peace deal reached last year, was having treatment for cancer.</p>
<p>Tudjman arrived in the United States on Monday last week and was treated at the Walter Reed Army hospital in Washington D.C., which often treats presidents and other U.S. dignitaries. The hospital declined comment on Tudjman's case.</p>
