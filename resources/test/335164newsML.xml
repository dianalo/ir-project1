<p>The Christian Social Union (CSU), Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Bavarian-based coalition partner, on Monday accused the U.S. State Department of falling for a Church of Scientology hate campaign against Germany.</p>
<p>CSU general secretary Bernd Protzner urged Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel to intervene in Washington to head off criticism the State Department has been reported to be planning against Germany for restrictions on the controversial group.</p>
<p>"Influential circles in the U.S. State Department have obviously fallen for (Scientology's) hate campaign against Germany and have let themselves be used by the sect," the conservative CSU said in a statement.</p>
<p>It quoted Protzner as saying the planned State Department report proved German authorities were right to combat Scientology, which promises its members inner peace if they go through a costly personality analysis.</p>
<p>"This sect is subversive and able in a frightening way to make or influence public opinion," Protzner said.  "We must do everything permissible under the law to expose the secret lodge-style practices of this association and stop the further expansion of this octopus."</p>
<p>The Washington Post reported on Monday that the State Department's annual survey of global human rights conditions would criticise Germany for "a campaign of harassment and intimidation" against the church.</p>
<p>The Church of Scientology filed an application with the European Commission of Human Rights on Friday, accusing the German government of discriminating against its members.</p>
<p>The church says it has documented more than 600 alleged human rights violations by the German government against Scientologists, and Bavaria recently passed a law banning Scientologists from holding public office.</p>
<p>Kohl this month dismissed an open letter from a group of Hollywood stars likening Germany's attitude towards Scientology to the infamous Nuremberg laws against Jews in pre-war Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>In another German attack on Scientology, the Protestant Center for Ideological Issues said it had strong indications the organisation had infiltrated government agencies in Poland and Russia and had links to Islamic fundamentalists.</p>
<p>Andreas Fincke, an official at the centre, told Saarland Radio that Scientology had quietly infiltrated companies, management schools and consulting firms in Germany.</p>
<p>"There is still no organisation you can ask to see whether a firm belongs to Scientology or not," he said.</p>
