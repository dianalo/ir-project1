<p>Mexican financial authorities said on Wednesday they plan to begin operations at a new derivatives market by October 20, which will list stock market, bond and foreign exchange futures.</p>
<p>"The target date has yet to be ratified," Bernardo Gonzalez, associate director general of derivatives at the Mexican Stock Exchange (BMV), said at a news conference.</p>
<p>The market will be officially created at a September meeting, Gonzalez added.</p>
<p>Membership of the Mexican Derivatives Market (Mexder) will be open to financial and non-financial companies, subject to their acquiring a minimum of one share each in the market.</p>
<p>BMV authorities said they see the first stage of futures trading through open outcry and based on the Mexican bourse's blue chip IPC index, 91-day Cetes (treasury bonds) and the Mexican peso.</p>
