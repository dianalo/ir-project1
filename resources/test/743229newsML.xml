<p>Workers at Duesseldorf airport, where 17 people died in a fire last year, extinguished a smouldering blaze in a rubbish bin on Monday which set off a fire alarm but injured nobody.</p>
<p>An airport spokesman said three fire doors near the bin had closed automatically, enclosing 50 passengers in an area away from the fire, but none had chosen to use the emergency exits because they saw no danger.</p>
<p>The fire, probably sparked by cigarette ash, started in the arrivals area of terminal C. Restaurant workers managed to put it out before firefighters arrived at the scene.</p>
