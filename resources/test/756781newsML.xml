<p>RESERVE BANK MAY CUT RATES TODAY</p>
<p>This week's low wage and inflation results have convinced many analysts there will be a cut to official interest rates later this morning.</p>
<p>In what would be the fifth easing within a year, many economists predict a cut of half-a-percentage point, as the Reserve Bank acts to stimulate the economy to create jobs.</p>
<p>Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane is in Shanghai, but Colonial State Bank chief economist Hans Kunnen said that does not lessen the chances of a big announcement at 9.30 a.m.</p>
<p>"We live in the 1990s, there are fax machines, there are Internet things, these things can be done, but it really all depends what decisions were taken at the previous Reserve Bank board meeting," Mr Kunnen said.</p>
<p>"They may already have decided to do something provided the wage and inflation numbers were good, and they both have been very good numbers."</p>
<p>Analysts believe any fears the Reserve Bank may have had about too much economic growth pushing up inflation are now allayed, and if it does not lower rates today, it will after the next Reserve Bank board meeting on August 5.</p>
<p>Mr Kunnen said the rate cut may even be three-quarters of one per cent.</p>

<p>WAGES FIGURES REVIVE LIVING WAGE CASE</p>
<p>Unions claim the latest wages figure show that low-paid workers should have been granted more in their Living Wage case.</p>
<p>Figures show wages grew only 3.7 percent over the past year, well below the expectations of markets and the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>ACTU President Jennie George claims the Industrial Relations Commission could have provided a larger increase without affecting the economy.</p>
<p>In April, the IRC granted the lowest paid an increase of $10 a week. The ACTU had asked for more, including a $20 a week safety-net increase for low paid people.</p>
<p>Ms George said another pay rise to low paid workers would actually boost consumption in the economy.</p>

<p>BAIL APPLICATION HEARING TO CONTINUE IN TOWNSVILLE TODAY</p>
<p>A Supreme Court hearing of a bail application for a man accused of throwing flammable liquid at a 10-year-old girl, will resume in Townsville this morning.</p>
<p>The Court adjourned late yesterday to consider whether he should have psychiatric assessment.</p>
<p>Justice Kerry Cullinane requested the adjourment to enable council to draft possible orders about the psychiatric examination of the 52-year-old man as a condition of bail.</p>
<p>The man is charged with grevious bodily harm and aggravated assault in relation to an incident which left Samantha Green with second and third degree burns.</p>
<p>Crown Prosecutor Michael Connolly said even if the man undergoes examination he should be placed in custody; describing the attack as a serious offence that could not be put down to someone losing their temper.</p>
<p>The accused's defence argued there was more to the case than had been revealed.</p>

<p>THREE DEAD IN WESTERN AUSTRALIAN SHOOTINGS</p>
<p>Police have located a third body at the scene of a fatal shooting near Moora, about 170 kilometres north of Perth.</p>
<p>They say the body is that of a male in his early 20's, but have not released any other details.</p>
<p>Yesterday, police located the bodies of a man and woman at a property, 27 kilometres south-west of Moora.</p>
<p>A relative of the dead couple reported an incident at a farm property off Rowse Road, about one o'clock.</p>
<p>A search was started soon after for a man reported to be armed with a high-powered rifle.</p>
<p>It is believed that the man police were searching for was the son of the dead couple.</p>

<p>BEAZLEY SAYS HANSON PHENOMENON CAN BE CONTROLLED</p>
<p>Federal Opposition leader Kim Beazley says British ministers have questioned him about the state of the race debate in Australia.</p>
<p>Mr Beazley is in London for talks with the new Labour government of Prime Minister Tony Blair.</p>
<p>He mentioned the race debate in a speech to an Australian Studies centre in London, saying Pauline Hanson and her supporters were an image problem Australia could control.</p>
<p>Mr Beazley said the Hanson phenomemon has been raised by political leaders and business figures he's been meeting.</p>
<p>"Of course it resonates much more in the Asia/Pacific region than it does here in the UK. But certainly it's raised as an issue, and I think it merely makes it that much more important for those of us in political life in Australia to confront it", Mr Beazley said.</p>

<p>BHP SAYS IT IS SPENDING FOR THE FUTURE OF STEEL INDUSTRY</p>
<p>BHP says it is spending $1 billion on capital investments, mostly at Port Kembla, to ensure there is a future for the steel industry in Australia.</p>
<p>The comments come as the BHP Board meets at Port Kembla.</p>
<p>BHP's Managing Director, John Prescott says the commitment to the industry comes despite there having been no growth in the domestic steel market in 20 years.</p>
<p>Mr Prescott says the decision is being taken for the future.</p>
<p>He says the company operates in an industry which has stiff world competition, and has virtually no tariff protection in Australia.</p>
<p>He says the Port Kembla plant is as big as it is because the company exports 40 percent of what it makes.</p>
<p>But the Australian Workers Union says it can not accept BHP's claims that it is not walking away from its involvment in the Australian steel industry.</p>
<p>Newcastle union organiser, Kevin Maher, says BHP is pouring money into developing new steelmaking technology overseas, while retaining old technology at its Port Kembla steelmaking plant.</p>

<p>D-DAY FOR AFL TRIBUNAL</p>
<p>The AFL should know today whether it has successfully appealed against the Supreme Court's ruling in the Greg Williams case.</p>
<p>The AFL Tribunal suspended Williams for nine matches for unduly interfering with an umpire, after Carlton's Round One match against Essendon.</p>
<p>But Carlton had the suspension quashed, with Supreme Court Justice Heddigan ruling Williams had been denied natural justice.</p>
<p>The AFL appealed, arguing the ruling had significant implications for its judicial system.</p>
<p>The Appeal Court is scheduled to deliver its judgement this morning.</p>
