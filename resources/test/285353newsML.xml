<p>Brazil's federal government will liquidate Previ-Banerj, the pension fund of the employees of Rio de Janeiro state bank Banerj, a spokeswoman for the Social Security Ministry said.</p>
<p>The decision to liquidate Previ-Banerj follows a Central Bank order earlier this week to liquidate the bad portion of Banerj, formally known as Banco do Estado do Rio de Janeiro, which remained with the control of the pension fund, the spokeswoman said.  </p>
<p>Banerj was split earlier this year into two units to facilitate the bank's privatization -- Banco do Estado do Rio de Janeiro to include its unrecoverable assets and Banco Banerj S.A., which will be sold off, for its regular banking operations.</p>
<p>Previ-Banerj is reported to have a deficit of up to 1.3 billion reais and was included in Banerj's bad debts.</p>
<p>With the liquidation of Previ-Banerj, the bank's employees and retirees will be allowed to be transferred to a new pension fund which will be created by the Rio de Janeiro state government.</p>
<p>After two failed attempts last month, Rio de Janeiro state hopes to privatize Banerj in February. Banerj is due to be the first of Brazilian state banks to be sold to private investors.</p>
