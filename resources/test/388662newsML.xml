<p>Indian securities firm ICICI Securities &amp; Finance Company (I-Sec) said on Wednesday it expected a cut-off yield of 13.60-13.65 percent at an auction of 10-year government bonds scheduled for Thursday.</p>
<p>"The auction on 20 February should see the cut-off yield in the region of 13.60 to 13.65 percent, the possibility of devolvement being remote," I-Sec said in a commentary.</p>
<p>"The new gilt issue completes the budgeted borrowing requirements of the government and is probably the first 10-year to be sold through an auction," it said.</p>
<p>The previous 10-year 20.0 billion rupee offer was at a fixed coupon of 13.85 percent and received 48 percent market subscription, I-Sec said.</p>
<p>"However, since then CRR (cash reserve ratio) has been reduced by 2.0 percent and yields have declined across maturities," it said.</p>
<p>"Issuance yields on three year and five year gilts have dropped by 30 and 20 basis points respectively and coupon on the 10-year state loan has dropped to 13.75 percent," it said.</p>
