<p>Chilean retail sales grew 1.2 percent in December against the same month last year, bringing the rise in sales last year to 4.9 percent compared with 1995, said the National Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Sales growth last year was much slower than in 1995 when retail sales climbed by 8.1 percent.</p>
<p>Last year's figures showed sales growth slowing from 7.4 percent in the first half of the year to 2.7 percent in the last six months.  </p>
<p>"The slowdown is an undeniable reflection of the adjustment which the economy is suffering," said Chamber president Alfonso Mujica.</p>
<p>The retail sector has been among the worst hit by the slowdown in Chile as the result of the Central Bank's year-long restrictive monetary policy.</p>
