<p>Biovail Corp shares rose after news that its new hypertension drug captured a stronger share of doctors' prescriptions than expected, said Biovail chairman Eugene Melnyk on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Biovail's hypertension drug, Tiazac, has captured five percent of all such new prescriptions, according to a group called IMS, which tracks new prescription trends, Melnyk said. The annual market for once-a-day usage of diltiazem, Tiazac's type of drug, is US$1 billion a year.</p>
<p>Shares jumped 3.85 to 49.85 on 527,841 shares in Toronto and by two to 36-1/4 on the American Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>More than half a million of the shares traded in Toronto were part of a block crossed by brokerage First Marathon.</p>
<p>The market share grab "is significantly ahead of our own internal numbers and expectations," Melnyk said.</p>
<p>"If that's the case, we should be able to sell US$50 million in the first 12 months" of the product launch as forecast, Melnyk said. Tiazac, launched in late February, is distributed by Forest Laboratories Inc in the United States. In the second year, Biovail expects to sell US$100 million.  With this kind of response, those numbers are "totally achievable," Melnyk said.  </p>
<p>"There was some controversy of whether the product will be able to capture US$50 million in the first year," Melnyk said.</p>
<p>Biovail stock in Toronto has climbed since Monday's daily low of 44.50, after the release of information from IMS International monitoring service.</p>
<p>Melnyk added that Biovail expects to announce European partners to distribute Tiazac in the U.K., Germany, France, Italy and Spain in the next few weeks. "We're in late-stage announcements with a couple of parties," he said.</p>
<p>In Toronto, Biovail stock is nearing its year-high of 54.50 and well above its year low of 14.33.</p>
