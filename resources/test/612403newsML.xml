<p>The first contingent of sugar bought by Iraq under its oil-for-food deal with the United Nations will reach the country on Saturday, Iraqi newspapers said.</p>
<p>"The first vessel laden with sugar under the memorandum of understanding with the United Nations will arrive at Umm Qasr port in the southern province of Basra today," al-Qadissiya daily reported.</p>
<p>"Iraqi ports authorities are prepared to unload the Liberian vessel which is carrying 16,475 tonnes of French sugar," it said.</p>
<p>Iraq began in April distributing food to its citizens under the oil deal, which lets Baghdad sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to meet urgent needs of Iraqis hit by U.N. trade sanctions since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The Iraqi government has accused Washington of delaying implementation of the pact. The U.S. envoy to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, has voiced misgivings about the deal, due for renewal next month.</p>
