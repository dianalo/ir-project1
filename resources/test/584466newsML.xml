<p>For the term sale of its 2.9 million tonnes of A-180 paraffinic naphtha, Saudi Aramco has set a target premia of $17.00-$17.50 per tonne compared to the $6.50 premium it received for its January to June 1997 contract.</p>
<p>They said most Japanese term buyers have submitted bids at premiums between $14-$15 per tonne.</p>
<p>Traders said Hyundai Petrochemical, India's Reliance and Kanematsu Corp have already met with Saudi Aramco officials on the first two days of the term talks that started on Monday.</p>
<p>Saudi Aramco expects to conclude the term discussions with 13 oil firms by Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders involved in the talks said companies were told to get back to Saudi Aramco if they are accepting the offers by the end of the week.</p>
