<p>Tiffany &amp; Co shares moved to new all-time high after the luxury goods retailer posted strong first quarter profits, driven by overseas demand, especially in Japan.</p>
<p>The earnings soundly beat Wall Street forecasts. Tiffany earned $0.25 a share in the first quarter, well above estimates of $0.19 according to First Call and 75 percent better than last year's $0.15 a share.</p>
<p>Shares were up 1-5/8 to 45 in early trading and touched a new record high of 45-3/4 during intraday trading.  </p>
<p>The jeweler said international retail sales, which account for almost half of its total sales, leaped 17 percent to $95.2 million.</p>
<p>Sales in Japan, its biggest international market, rose 50 percent in local currency and were boosted by strong sales at Tiffany's new flagship Tokyo store, which opened in May 1996 in the renowned Ginza district. Same-store sales in Japan rose 26 percent in local currency, and rose 29 percent when translated into dollars.</p>
<p>Sales in the United States rose nine percent to $87.7 million, with same-store sales growth of seven percent.  </p>
<p>The only trouble spot for Tiffany was in direct marketing sales, made through its corporate and catalog divisions, where sales fell 12 percent to $16.7 million.</p>
<p>The division accounts for only eight percent of Tiffany's total retail sales. The company said the shortfall was due to a move to a new customer service and distribution center, and said productivity should resume at normal levels shortly.</p>
<p>This year, Tiffany plans to expand into four new U.S. markets including Palo Alto, California and Cincinnati, Ohio. It is also planning new locations in Japan and said it is finalizing plans to open a Tiffany boutique in Mexico City.</p>
