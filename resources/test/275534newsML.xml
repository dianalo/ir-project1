<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Tuesday he was disappointed that the High Court had failed to clarify the effects of native title claims on pastoral leases in a ruling handed down on Monday.</p>
<p>"I am disappointed that yesterday's High Court decision in the Wik case failed to clarify satisfactorily uncertainties concerning the effect of native title on pastoral leases," Howard said in a statement.</p>
<p>The High Court ruled that pastoral leases did not automatically extinguish aboriginal land claims.</p>
<p>The court found that the two rights could co-exist.  </p>
<p>It had been hoped the High Court would move to clarify native title issues, which have been clouded by uncertainty since the introduction of legislation in 1993.</p>
<p>But Howard said the ruling created more confusion since it threatened the assumption, on which the 1993 native title laws were based, that pastoral leases extinguished native title claims.</p>
<p>"The judgement therefore has obvious ramifications for the Native Title Act as currently framed," Howard said.</p>
<p>"It raises questions well beyond those which the government's current amendments were proposed to address."  </p>
<p>The government has introduced into parliament amendments that would make it more difficult for aboriginal groups to force negotiations on land claims.</p>
<p>"The government will urgently consult with state and territory governments and other interested parties about whether the Native Title Act needs to be further amended in light of yesterday's judgement," Howard said.</p>
<p>The amendments are due to be debated in parliament early next year.  </p>
<p>In 1992, the High Court overturned the historical idea of Terra Nullus -- that Australia was an empty land when white settlers arrived in 1788 -- thus recognising that Aborigines had traditional land rights.</p>
<p>In 1993, the Australian government passed legislation allowing Aborigines to claim land if they could prove uninterrupted traditional usage of that land.</p>
