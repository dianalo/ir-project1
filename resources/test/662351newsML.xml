<p>The head of U.S. forces in the Gulf, visiting this sweltering desert base with Defence Secretary William Cohen, said on Sunday Iraq's air force had recently increased training exercises, including limited night flights.</p>
<p>But Army General Binford Peay, chief of the U.S. Central Command with responsibility for the region, said that Iraq's air force, decimated in the 1991 Gulf War, was no threat to U.S. and allied air power despite the increased training.</p>
<p>"In the past three months, we have seen an increase in their flight posture. They have even begun a very little night training," Peay told reporters.</p>
<p>But "compared against the advantage of our people, they don't sit in the same league," he said, adding that dozens of U.S., British and French jets sometimes flew as many as 200 daily missions over southern Iraq to keep watch over President Saddam Hussein's military.</p>
<p>Cohen, wearing a dark suit and tie in 47 degree Celsius (117 Fahrenheit) heat, told some of the 4,000 U.S. airforce troops at this remote, high security base that threats from Iraq and Iran would not drive the U.S. military from the Gulf.</p>
<p>"We are determined to protect our interests and theirs," Cohen said of the powerful U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia and other Gulf Arab states since the war with Iraq.</p>
<p>"We are going to have a U.S. presence as long as there remains a threat to the Gulf area," he added.</p>
<p>Cohen, who inspected jets, Patriot anti-aircraft missile batteries and a swimming pool for the troops in the desert, spoke days ahead of the anniversary of the truck bombing at a military barracks in al-KHobar in Saudi on June 25, 1996 that killed 19 U.S. troops.</p>
<p>The U.S. air force along with French and British forces moved attack jets and crews to this remote base 145 kms (90 miles) south of Riyadh for safety after the bombing.</p>
<p>Allied jets based in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait fly daily over southern Iraq, monitoring compliance with an allied "no fly zone" in order for Saddam not to attack Shi'ites in the area or build up his forces for any new strike against Kuwait, a move that sparked the Gulf War.</p>
<p>"We are always on alert," said Peay when asked if any special precautions were being taken for the anniversary.</p>
<p>Peay said that the Iraqi air exercises did not take place in the south or in a similar no-fly zone in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>He said security at the Prince Sultan base as "superb".</p>
<p>"But by no means does that imply that terrorists cannot get through," he said. "You never finish enhancing defensive security."</p>
<p>Cohen, who met Saudi Arabia's King Fahd on arriving in Jeddah on Saturday, held talks on Sunday with Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah and Defence Minister Prince Sultan before flying to Kuwait for meetings with leaders of the emirate.</p>
<p>He will later visit Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman before flying home on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Cohen told reporters on arrival in Saudi Arabia that Washington was "hopeful but sceptical" that Iran would give up its support of international terrorism following the election of Mohammad Khatami as president last month.</p>
<p>But he also vowed in an interview aboard his aircraft en route to Jeddah that the United States would not soften its hardline policy toward Iran unless there were signs it had changed its attitude toward the West and its opposition to the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>Khatami's election has raised hopes that Tehran would soften its own tough policy toward the West.</p>
