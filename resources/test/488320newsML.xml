<headline>New York's Agway Inc recalls frozen strawberries.</headline>
<dateline>SYRACUSE, N.Y. 1997-04-04</dateline>

<p>Agricultural cooperative Agway Inc said it was voluntarily recalling 779 containers of frozen strawberries from its stores after learning they came from a company which shipped berries associated with a Hepatitis A virus outbreak.</p>
<p>Agway said it began contacting its retail stores and customers on Thursday after learning from its supplier that the 30-pound containers of strawberries were shipped by Epitope Inc's Andrew and Williamson Sales Co.</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, Epitope said Andrew and Williamson voluntarily recalled frozen sliced strawberries shipped to distributors because they were associated with a Hepatitis A outbreak in some Michigan schools.</p>
<p>The Syracuse-based cooperative said the recall was precautionary and was not requested by regulators.</p>
<p>Customers who bought sliced frozen strawberries in 30-pound containers through Agway's frozen food order program since July 1996 were asked to return the product for a full refund, the cooperative said.</p>
<p>"We are taking this voluntary action in the interest of our customers' well-being and to preserve the trust they've placed in Agway," Donald Schalk, vice president of Agway Retail Services, said.</p>
<p>When ordering the strawberries, Agway said it had specified the product be grown within the United States.</p>
<p>A confirmation order from its supplier related to this shipment said the berries were "California sliced strawberries."</p>
