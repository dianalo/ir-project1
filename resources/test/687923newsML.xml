<p>The Taiwan dollar edged slightly higher in early Wednesday trade, as investors sought to profit from the banking system's liquidity squeeze, dealers said.</p>
<p>After 45 minutes, or 0145 GMT, the local unit was at T$27.874 against Tuesday's T$27.885 finish.</p>
<p>Turnover through dealers was US$22 million.</p>
<p>"Many investors are selling U.S. dollars in exchange for Taiwan dollars following the surges in overnight interbank rate," said a dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>"The overnight interbank rate is much more attractive now," the dealer said.  </p>
<p>Taiwan's interbank rate roared briefly above nine percent and closed at a 21-month peak on Tuesday despite central bank stabilisation efforts, as a frantic stock market siphoned funds from the banking system.</p>
<p>With routine quarter-end greenback demand coming to an end, dealers said they saw more room for the Taiwan dollar to rise.</p>
<p>A range of T$27.85-90 was seen for Wednesday.</p>
