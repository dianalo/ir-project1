<p>Secessionists on Bougainville island in Papua New Guinea on Monday released photographs of a reported mortar attack by government troops that killed nine civilians in a church.</p>
<p>The pictures allegedly show the aftermath of the attack last month on Malapita village in rebel-held Bougainville as villagers gathered for morning prayers.</p>
<p>Bougainville Interim Government spokeswoman Marilyn Havini told Reuters the pictures were taken by a Bougainville Revolutionary Army Commander after the bodies were removed from the church for burial.</p>
<p>The film was taken to the Solomon Islands in Honiara, and then sent to Australia, where some of the pictures were published by newspapers on Monday.</p>
<p>The Australian newspaper quoted Dale Tom, whose two brothers died in the attack, as saying seven mortars were fired, with the last two crashing through the roof of the bush church.</p>
<p>Papua New Guinea Defence Force Chief-of-Staff Colonel Jack Tuat told Reuters earlier this month he was not aware of the Malapita attack.</p>
<p>"There have been no directions for special operations which would require the use of mortars," said Tuat in the capital Port Moresby, 800 km (500 miles) southwest of Bougainville.</p>
<p>The Bougainville Interim Government issued a statement earlier this month saying more than 20 civilians, including children, had been killed in two weeks by troops and government-backed resistance fighters on Bougainville.</p>
<p>Thousands have died from fighting or disease since the start of the Bougainville conflict eight years ago.</p>
