<p>The Philippine government said on Wednesday the country's widening trade deficit would not appear so high if foreign investment figures and earnings from overseas Filipino workers were taken into account.</p>
<p>The deficit in the country's trade and investments this year is expected to be less than $1 billion, Trade and Industry Secretary Cesar Bautista said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Many countries have already reported trade in terms of goods and services - such as the U.S., Britain, Singapore, Australia, Japan, Australia, etc.," he said.</p>
<p>The Central Bank recently said the country's merchandise trade deficit is expected to hit about $12.0 billion this year from $9.091 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>In the first eight months of this year, the trade deficit was $8.147 billion compared with $5.559 billion in the year-earlier period.</p>
<p>If portfolio and foreign direct investments are included, Bautista said "the 'real' gap in our trade/investments is less than $1 billion which is not a major worry."</p>
