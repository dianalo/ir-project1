<p>Vienna City Council will hire an international investment house to advise it in the privatisation of the nation's top bank Bank Austria, Social Democrat mayor Michael Haeupl said.</p>
<p>Vienna announced last month it wanted to offload its 49 percent Bank Austria voting stake, currently with holding companies AVZ and Wiener Holding, within the next six years.</p>
<p>"We want to depoliticise Bank Austria," Haeupl told journalists late on Thursday after talks with the bank's chief executive Gerhard Randa.</p>
<p>Haeupl said he expected the report to be ready by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Vienna's coalition of Social Democrats and conservative People's Party, which mirrors the national government, has said Bank Austria must remain under majority Austrian control. It has also stipulated the sale must not put an undue burden on Vienna financial markets nor damage the bank.</p>
<p>Haeupl and his conservative deputy Bernhard Goerg differed on the definition of damage. Goerg said he would be willing to see Bank Austria's AAA rating disappear with Vienna City guarantees on liabilities.</p>
<p>"That would be a loss that would harm the bank," Haeupl argued.</p>
<p>Bank Austria boss Randa welcomed the involvement of an international investment house in the planned sale.</p>
<p>He and Haeupl have come under heavy political fire since it emerged last month that German Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale had first refusal on Bank Austria shares held by AVZ. Conservatives said they had been kept in the dark.</p>
<p>"Until the WestLB option expires (on March 31, 2001) there will be no significant sale of AVZ shares. Probably there will be no sale at all," Randa said. -- Vienna newsroom, +43-1 531 12 254</p>
