<p>Prices of U.S. Treasury securities ended  sharply lower on Friday, with the benchmark 30-year bond diving two  full points, as further signs of a turbo-charged economy sent up an  inflation yellow flag.</p>
<p>"The selloff was violent," said Michelle Colley Laughlin, Treasury  strategist at Prudential Securities Inc.</p>
<p>"I had come in today anticipating that we were at risk of a correction."</p>
<p>Indeed, the market may have gotten more than it bargained for, as  a crush of economic data offered much trading fodder.  </p>
<p>The day kicked off with the July employment report, which showed the  country added a whopping 316,000 new jobs in the month, eclipsing  analysts' expectations for a 193,000-new-job gain. Meanwhile, the  unemployment rate slipped two notches to 4.8 percent from 5.0 percent  in June.</p>
<p>Treasury bond prices chopped and changed after the report, immediately  erasing a 7/32 gain and converting it into a 7/32 loss, as dealers  focused on the payrolls' increase.</p>
<p>But minutes later, the benchmark issue was back up at unchanged as  traders shifted their focus from the payrolls jump to an unchanged  reading on average hourly earnings.  </p>
<p>Earnings were flat at $12.23 an hour. June's figure was revised up  one cent from $12.22 originally.</p>
<p>The market momentarily embraced what it called "good news" on wages,  and proceeded to hover around slightly lower levels until the selling  flood gates opened at 1000 EDT/1400 GMT.</p>
<p>At that time, the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM)  released its much-watched survey of industry activity. NAPM's diffusion  index soared to 58.6 percent in July, its highest since November 1994  when it registered 59.1 percent. The production index printed 64.4,  a 9-1/2-year high, and the new orders component hit a three-year peak.   </p>
<p>"(The NAPM) index served as a catalyst for some profit-taking before  the refunding" next week, said Matthew Alexy, chief markets strategist  for fixed income at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>Alexy was referring to the Treasury's sale next Tuesday, Wednesday,  and Thursday of $16.0 billion in three-year notes, $12.0 billion in  10-year notes, and $10.0 billion in 30-year bonds, respectively. The  quarterly refunding effort will total $38.0 billion compared to $39.0  billion in May.</p>
<p>The prices index shot to 53.6 from 48.1, but Norbert Ore, head of  the NAPM survey committee was not overly concerned.  </p>
<p>In a teleconference with members of the financial press following  the July NAPM's release, Ore said purchasing managers were not yet  voicing concerns about rising prices.</p>
<p>Asked if price pressures stood toward the bottom of a list of member  concerns, Ore responded: "(Price jitters) were not on the list at  all."</p>
<p>But the very fact that the prices component leapt 5.5 percentage points  spooked the Treasury market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Combined with gains in new orders and production -- other key components  of the index -- bonds collapsed, falling more than two full points.   </p>
<p>Still, Alexy pointed out that the selling was overdone. "If prices  everywhere in the economy were going up 0.1 percentage point, the  prices index in NAPM would be 100."</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury security ended the day down 2-3/32  at 102-7/32 to yield 6.46 percent compared to 6.30 at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Asked what type of damage Friday's freefall may have done to the technical  picture for Treasuries, David Ging, technical analyst at Donaldson,  Lufkin and Jenrette Securities Corp, said: "We've at least put in  a near-term top."</p>
<p>Ging pointed to 114-19/32 and 113-19/32 as two potential retracement  targets for T-bond futures next week, but said upcoming supply would  make it tough for the market to rally.</p>
<p>The University of Michigan also released its July final index of consumer  sentiment Friday. It soared to an all-time high of 107.1, up from  104.5 in the final June report.</p>
<p>Also, the Commerce Department reported personal income up 0.6 percent  in June and spending up 0.3 percent.</p>
