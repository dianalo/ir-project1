<p>The Republican Party on Friday elected Colorado land developer and building contracter Jim Nicholson as its new chairman, choosing a conservative with no national political experience for the powerful post.</p>
<p>Nicholson, 58, emerged from a field of eight when his remaining rivals withdrew after five ballots of the Republican National Committee.</p>
<p>"We are the party of opportunity and hope and we are the conservative party. We are the party of moral courage," Nicholson said in a victory statement.</p>
<p>"I intend to be a forceful messenger for our conservative ideas and values," he said.</p>
<p>After a bruising, sometimes dirty campaign, Nicholson took a decisive lead among the 165 members of the Republican National Committee on the fifth ballot. But he was nine votes short of a majority when his remaining opponents, former New Hampshire Gov. Steve Merrill and New Jersey moderate David Norcross, decided to bow out.</p>
<p>In a coincidental twist, Nicholson's election means both the Republicans and Democrats will be headed by men from Colorado. President Bill Clinton this week named Colorado Gov. Roy Romer as Democratic Party chairman.</p>
<p>In choosing Nicholson, the party turned to a businessman from the grassroots. But the job of chairman increasingly involves television appearances and public speaking.</p>
<p>Retiring chairman Haley Barbour, who ran the party for four years, emerged as an influential Republican powerbroker, presiding over a campaign war chest of hundreds of millions of dollars as well as becoming a familiar face on television.</p>
<p>After Republican candidates spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on campaign videos, mailings and travel, the election turned into a fight for the future direction of the party.</p>
<p>Nicholson was well behind Merrill and Norcross on the first three ballots, but neither of his opponents could extend their support since both were opposed by the powerful conservative wing of the party.</p>
<p>Merrill ran into opposition from critics who said he was too closely associated with Bob Dole's failed 1996 presidential bid.</p>
<p>In contrast, Nicholson backed the presidential campaign of Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, who preached an uncompromising message of economic austerity.</p>
<p>Last week all 165 committee members received unsigned mailings suggesting infidelity to his third wife forced Merrill not to seek re-election as New Hampshire governor. The mailings included photocopies of his two divorce decrees.</p>
<p>"Stooping to anonymous mailings doesn't help anybody," Barbour said. "To the degree that people are injecting crap like that into it, it's demeaning to the process."</p>
