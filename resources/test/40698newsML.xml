<p>Analysts' consensus estimate for the third quarter is $0.56 a share, according to First Call.</p>
<p>America West cited lower than expected yields in July and August caused by high jet fuel prices, industry capacity increases, aggressive fare sale activity earlier in the quarter, and operating dependability difficulties encountered during the summer.</p>
<p>The airline also reported available seat miles for the month of August increased 10.7 percent from a year earlier, to 1.9 billion, resulting in a passenger load factor of 74.7 percent compared to 75.1 percent in August 1995.</p>
<p>America West said it is working to resolve its problems.</p>
<p>Shares of America West were 1/4 higher at 13-3/8 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
