<p>The European Commission adopted a strategy paper on Wednesday calling for the use of renewable energy sources to be doubled by 2010, saying their share of total energy consumption in the EU was disappointing.</p>
<p>The Commission said in a green paper that renewable energy sources such as biomass, wind, wave and solar power should increase to account for 12 percent of total energy consumption from six percent now.</p>
<p>"First of all we must aim on the Community level at a clear increase, ambitious but realistic, of the contribution of renewables to the Union's energy mix," the document said.</p>
<p>The Commission paper said renewable energy sources were currently insufficiently exploited in the EU with wide differences in how it is used between member states.</p>
<p>Total energy consumption is forecast to grow further in the EU and even if the use of renewable energy sources increases considerably it would not be enough to satisfy rising demand.</p>
<p>If the Union did not succeed in raising the share of renewable energy sources, the Commission warned, it would become increasingly difficult to meet international commitments on the environment.</p>
<p>The EU aims to cut CO2 emissions to 1990 levels by 2000.</p>
<p>To achieve its target to boost renewables, the Commission proposed strengthening cooperation between member states in promoting such energy sources and of EU policies concerning the development of renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>The paper aims to stimulate a discussion and the Commission will return with a more detailed strategy and action plan by 1997.</p>
<p>Just last week, the European Parliament said the EU should do more to stimulate the use of renewable sources of energy.</p>
<p>In a report, parliament urged the European Commission and the member states to take practical action to increase the percentage of renewables in the energy mix.</p>
<p>This should include improving access for energy from renewable sources to the electricity grid, giving tax advantages to investments in renewables and dismantling subsidies on fossil fuels, the Euro-MPs said.</p>
<p>They warned of the increasing damage to the environment which fossil fuels were causing.</p>
