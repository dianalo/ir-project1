<p>Germany's second largest commercial bank said on Sunday it had to make investments for the switch to a European currency soon and would welcome more public certainty that it will be launched on time.</p>
<p>"Technical preparations for the Euro will require two years, and investments -- mostly in data processing -- of between $100 and $200 million for our bank," Dresdner chief executive Juergen Sarrazin told a news conference.</p>
<p>"Counting back two years from January 1, 1999 means that we are now on the verge of committing major funds to the project," he added.</p>
<p>Europe plans to set up a single currency, to be called the Euro, from January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>The Euro will exist in parallel to the national currencies it will ultimately replace for a preiod of about three years, until notes and coins are available.</p>
<p>Sarrazin said that, although Dresdner itself was now convinced that the launch date would be met, greater political reassurance on this would be helpful, given that banks were now about to commit funds to the project.</p>
<p>"We would, of course, prefer a climate of less public uncertainty and less ambiguity by some of our politicians," he said, referring to public discussion about the exact standards countries must meet to qualify to join the Euro.</p>
<p>The economic conditions that nations must meet to join the currency are laid down in the Maastricht Treaty on monetary union but some of the standards allow a certain amount of leeway for interpretation.</p>
<p>This is particularly the case on the standards set for budget deficits -- the area where most nations are finding most difficulty in complying with the strict Maastricht rules.</p>
<p>"While the Maastricht Treaty does leave some room for interpretation, that room is quite limited and we (Dresdner) have not moved from our long-held position that the Treaty in all its provisions should be respected, he said.</p>
<p>Sarrazin added that last weekend's meeting of European Finance Ministers in Dublin had provided some reassurance that the planned single currency would be stable and had addressed some of the bank's concerns.</p>
<p>The ministers agreed on the broad framework of a stability pact to ensure fiscal discipline within monetary union and also set the basic structure for a new exchange rate mechanism to group currencies that do not join the Euro immediately.</p>
<p>Sarrazin said it was essential for the smooth transition to a single currency that individual banks make the necessary preparation on time, meaning that all possible uncertainties about the project should be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"As a large bank with a major role in the payments systems, we think we have a responsibility to begin now with the technical preparations for the Euro," he said.</p>
<p>"It would make us look very bad indeed, if EMU should fail to start and run smoothly for lack of technical competence at the banks," he said.</p>
