<p>An airborne search was due to resume at dawn on Saturday for 28 seamen missing in a remote part of the South Atlantic after their ship sank in unexplained circumstances while carrying sugar from Brazil to Iraq.</p>
<p>South African state radio said a South African airforce Hercules which searched the area of the sinking for several hours without sighting any survivors returned to base late on Friday and would resume its mission in the morning.</p>
<p>First reports said all 28 crew members of the general cargo vessel Jahan abandoned ship after the freighter began taking on water and were presumed to be in lifeboats.</p>
<p>Airforce spokeswoman Marietta Hopley said the C-130 Hercules aircraft had arrived at the scene, 680 miles west of Cape Town, at about 1430 GMT on Friday, some 15 hours after maritime authorities picked up a distress call.</p>
<p>"In the search area the weather is fine. There is no problem. The swell is 1.5 metres (five feet) and there is no problem with cloud or fog. Nothing has been sighted so far," Hopley told Reuters.</p>
<p>There was no immediate indication what caused the 15,022- deadweight tonne Jahan, built in 1972, registered in Belize and operated by Seatimes shipping of Singapore, to sink.</p>
<p>The weather in the region, midway between the South African coast and the remote island of Tristan da Cunha, was reported to be fine at the time.</p>
<p>The Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre in Australia picked up a mayday distress call at around midnight GMT saying the freighter was flooding and the crew were abandoning ship. The centre said the Jahan went down five hours afterwards.</p>
<p>Hopley said South Africa's search aircraft had made contact with two of three ships at sea which were steaming towards the Jahan's last reported position. The ships were expected to reach the area at first light on Saturday.</p>
<p>There were no reports of injury to the crew, but one rescue official said it was unusual that no emergency positioning radio beacon signal had been received.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Seatimes in Singapore told Reuters that the Jahan, owned by Jahan shipping of Panama, was on charter to a London company and carrying a cargo of 14,000 tonnes of sugar from Brazil to Iraq.</p>
<p>An accord between Iraq and the United Nations, concluded after months of wrangling, allows Iraq to sell a certain amount of oil twice a year to pay for food imports, alleviating the effect of U.N. economic sanctions on the Iraqi people.</p>
<p>It was not clear whether the Jahan's cargo was part of the oil-for-food deal.</p>
