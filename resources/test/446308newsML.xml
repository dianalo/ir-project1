<p>Despite dropping year earnings per share by six percent, South Africa's Anglo American Industrial Corp (Amic) said most operations enjoyed a robust second half last year and looked forward to raising profits in 1997.</p>
<p>"It had us worried, but hopefully the cycle we're in has this (1996) as the weakest year. All indications are for a real increase in earnings in 1997. Most operations had a very strong second half," Amic chairman Leslie Boyd said on Monday.</p>
<p>He added that, with the rights issue of 8.196 million new ordinary shares, announced last September, a rise in profits would be large enough to translate into an increase in earnings per share as well.</p>
<p>Amic announced headline earnings per share for the year ended December 31 of 1,476 cents compared to 1,569 cents previously and lower than analysts' consensus forecast of 1,498.75 cents per share.</p>
<p>The group held its total dividend steady at 545 cents.</p>
<p>Boyd said that in the year ahead Amic would focus increasingly on sustainable competitive advantages and on further global opportunities.</p>
<p>Last August Amic and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp announced a 100 million rand investment fund joint venture and in January this year Amic signed a joint venture with two more Japanese firms, Komatsu Ltd and Itochu Ltd .</p>
<p>"Throughout the Amic group we are very keen on these joint ventures with major partners," Boyd told a results presentation.</p>
<p>Asked whether Amic was considering unbundling in the future, Boyd said that it would not be beneficial to Amic's operations.</p>
<p>"If you haven't got big companies, you can't do big things. And if you can't do big things, then you can't compete in the global village," he said.</p>
<p>Highveld Steel and Vanadium Corp , announcing in February a slide in headline earnings per share to 68.7 cents from 216.2 cents previously, and its stake in the giant Columbus Stainless steel project was largely responsible for much of the eroding of Amic's year profit.</p>
<p>"The major element (in Highveld) was in fact the question of Columbus. 1996 worldwide was a bad year for steel," Boyd said.</p>
<p>"Highveld's share of the Columbus capital expansion costs as at December 31 was 1.36 billion rand. A modest increase in Highveld's earnings is expected in 1997," he added.</p>
<p>Unlisted pulp and paper products division Mondi staged a brave show in the face of difficult market conditions, despite shrinking available profit for the period ended December 31 to 484 million rand from 501 million rand.</p>
<p>"We're quite pleased with these results given the difficult trading conditions," Amic said, adding that the operation held almost no hedges in 1996 and was therefore able to benefit from the rand's weakness.</p>
<p>Amic said that pulp prices remained weak but were likely to recover in the second half of 1997.</p>
<p>Plastics and chemicals company AECI Ltd , mining equipment company Boart Longyear, construction company LTA Ltd, Scaw metals and Tongaat-Hulett Group Ltd were all set to improve earnings and continue growth in 1997.</p>
