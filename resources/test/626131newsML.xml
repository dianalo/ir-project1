<p>Fugitive Turkish Cypriot tycoon Asil Nadir said on Friday he would return to Britain if he is guaranteed he will not be arrested and if the government holds a public inquiry into the collapse of his business empire.</p>
<p>Nadir, who is wanted for fraud in Britain, jumped bail four years ago after the collapse of his Polly Peck International fruit-to-electronics empire.</p>
<p>He told BBC radio he was prepared to do whatever is required of him if he is given the guarantees.</p>
<p>"If I have an assurance to the government of Turkey that I will not be arrested (in Britain)...I'd be delighted to come back with a definite undertaking that there will be a public inquiry," he said.</p>
<p>"It is important for the British public to find out what actually went on," he added.</p>
<p>The flamboyant businessman said he fled Britain for Northern Cyprus rather than face trail on charges of theft and false accounting because he had no confidence in the British justice system.</p>
<p>"These allegations against me were done without any investigations whatsoever," he said. "You don't arrest someone, charge them and then try to find out how you can proceed with the matter."</p>
<p>Since he fled Britain in May 1993, Nadir has hinted that he would return if the Conservatives, who were defeated by Labour in the May 1 election, were no longer the governing party.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Nadir told his lawyers to sue Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) for wrongly trying to prosecute him but said it was unlikely he would return to Britain in the forseeable future.</p>
<p>Preparations for a trial of Nadir were thrown into chaos before he fled Britain when the authorities said they had discovered an attempt to pervert the course of justice. The charges were later found to be groundless and dropped.</p>
<p>In March the convictions against Nadir's former aide Elizabeth Forsyth were quashed. An appeal court ruled the two convictions for handling stolen cash were unsafe, but the SFO said it did not affect its case against Nadir.</p>
<p>A British newspaper also reported that SFO officers were sent to Turkey this month for talks with judicial officials in Ankara after Nadir was said to be travelling there.</p>
<p>The Turkish police, who are members of Interpol, were told to be on the lookout for the tycoon who is a Turkish citizen.</p>
<p>Polly Peck collapsed in 1990 with huge debts. Nadir cannot be extradited from Northern Cyprus which is not recognised by Britian.</p>
<p>Turkey invaded northern Cyprus in 1974 after a shortlived military coup on the island. Only Ankara recognises Northern Cyprus.</p>
