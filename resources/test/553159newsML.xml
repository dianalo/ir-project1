<headline>SOCCER SHOWCASE-MATCH ANALYSIS OF BAYERN V 1860 MUNICH.</headline>
<dateline>BONN 1997-05-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>A look at the strengths and weaknesses of 1860 Munich and Bayern Munich ahead of their Bundesliga match in the Olympic Stadium on Sunday (kickoff 1600 GMT).</p>
<p>1860 Munich</p>
<p>Playing style: 1860 play traditional libero system. Polish international Peter Nowak is the side's main playmaker, providing the link between defence and attack from his berth in central midfield.</p>
<p>Strengths: Nowak's ability to slice open defences with a single pass, dangerous crosses from Austria's Harald Cerny and clinical finishing from striker Bernhard Winkler. 1860 also have a strong team spirit, encouraged by fiery coach Werner Lorant.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Slightly suspect defence which has conceded 44 goals this season -- more than any of their rivals for a UEFA Cup place.</p>
<p>Motivation: 1860 are desperate to return to European competition after decades of underachievement. Club also keen to put one over on Bayern, the local rivals who replaced 1860 as Munich's main team in the late 1960s and have not looked back since. Derby atmosphere likely to provide ample motivation for both teams.</p>
<p>Team (probable): Rainer Berg; Bernhard Trares; Thomas Miller, Matthias Hamann, Marco Walker; Peter Nowak, Jens Jeremies, Daniel Borimirov, Manfred Bender; Harald Cerny. Bernhard Winkler.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>Bayern Munich</p>
<p>Playing style: Traditional continental approach with Lothar Matthaeus as libero, central defenders Thomas Helmer and Markus Babbel supported by wing backs. Injuries to other players have forced coach Giovanni Trapattoni to move Mario Basler into central midfield from his usual position on the right. Basler has flourished in his new role, acting as the team's main creative force and providing the link to strikers Juergen Klinsmann and Ruggiero Rizzitelli.</p>
<p>Strengths: Rock-solid defence which has conceded only 27 goals all season -- fewer than any other Bundesliga side. The team is also very dangerous at set-pieces where the likes of Basler and Matthaeus are always capable of springing a surprise.</p>
<p>Weaknesses: Bayern have sometimes shown a lack of creativity this season, partly caused by absence of midfielder Mehmet Scholl due to injury and a crisis in form. Although Basler has compensated to an extent, the team may have become too dependent on the former Bremen player.</p>
<p>Motivation: League leaders Bayern need a win to stay clear of chasing pack. Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen will have drawn level on points with Bayern if they beat Borussia Moenchengladbach on Saturday. If Leverkusen have lost, match will give Bayern chance to pull six points clear with four games left to play.</p>
<p>Team (probable): Oliver Kahn; Lothar Matthaeus; Thomas Helmer, Markus Babbel, Christian Ziege, Dietmar Hamann; Christian Nerlinger, Mario Basler, Alexander Zickler; Ruggiero Rizzitelli, Juergen Klinsmann.</p>
