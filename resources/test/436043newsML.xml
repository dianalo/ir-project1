<p>Leading Lithuanian bank Vilniaus Bank said on Wednesday that it was interested in managing more global depositary receipts (GDR) issues for its local corporate clients.</p>
<p>Vilniaus Bank late last year helped to issue $6 million in GDRs for Birzai Dairy after successfully launching a $17.1 million issue for itself through Nomura.</p>
<p>"We want to issue other GDRs for corporate clients and hope to do one soon," Raimondas Kutra, deputy chairman of Vilniaus Bank's board, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Kutra said Vilniaus Bank, which is about 90 percent foreign owned, had a good year in 1996 but would not reveal any specific figures.</p>
<p>The bank's 1996 results are due out later this month and the market anticipates that they will be healthy.</p>
<p>Kutra said the bank had no immediate plans to boost its share capital or buy into other banks.</p>
<p>"We are always looking into the possibility of buying into other local banks but don't see any prospects at the moment," he said.</p>
<p>"It is easier to take away customers than to buy the bank itself," he added.</p>
<p>Kutra said he was sceptical about the government's plan to privatise two of the country's three state banks, the State Commercial bank and the Agriculture Bank.</p>
<p>"Investors will not likely find these banks to be very attractive, especially if the process drags on...the current managers know the banks are to be privatized and so they don't have much incentive to improve the situation," he said.</p>
<p>He added that no-one knew for sure what problems were plaguing the State Commercial Bank, which the government rescued last year from the brink of collapse under the weight of its bad loan portfolio.</p>
<p>Kutra said  some Lithuanian banks would have difficulty meeting the tough new international accounting standards required by the central bank.</p>
<p>"We may see the real picture in all of the banks this year," he said. "In some cases, the picture may not be pretty."</p>
<p>Lithuania's banking sector is currently recovering from a crisis which broke at the end of 1995 with the shock closure of two of the country's biggest banks.</p>
<p>Kutra said that Vilniaus Bank's loan portfolio on March 7 of this year was 476.5 billion litas.</p>
<p>The bank's share capital at the end of 1996 was 101.9 million litas and its assets were worth 937.7 million litas.</p>
