<p>Leading Russian shares changed little on Monday in lethargic trading on weak Western support, traders said.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index of 23 shares slipped by 1.15 percent to 295.61 on $18.56 million in total market volume. "The market is very soft without Western support," said UFG trader Maxim Perlin.</p>
<p>"If there is demand it is unable to change the situation. The market is now moved by two major factors: expectations of big Western orders and corporate news, which only cause purely technical changes."</p>
<p>Traders said the results of Mosenergo power utility announced at today's shareholders' meeting were positive for the market, but had little impact.</p>
<p>Mosenergo shareholders' meeting decided to consider increasing authorised capital in the future but not in the next two to three months.</p>
<p>The meeting approved a 50 rouble dividend for 1996, unchanged from 1995. The approved net profit to Russian cash accounting standards was 2.8 trillion roubles afer 2.4 trillion in 1995.</p>
<p>The company said it hoped to get a Standard &amp; Poor's rating for its $150 million Eurobond issue in May.</p>
<p>Mosenergo fell to $1.255 from $1.293 at Friday's closing and national power utility UES dropped to $0.2162 from $0.2215.</p>
<p>Perlin said he did not expect the market to move strongly in the near future.</p>
<p>"I think prices are quite stable and no correction will be seen," he said.</p>
<p>Bank Menatep securities' department head Sergei Kosynkin said there was some demand in most volatile shares, like Mosenergo, UES and LUKoil and attributed it to Western speculative demand after mid-day price falls.</p>
<p>"But they are still busy with their Dow Jones, that's why the orders are very small," he said. "Although I do not rule out that tomorrow the market will be a bit more active, we are not accustomed to keeping the market at the same level without any volume."</p>
<p>LUKoil was $13.30 after $13.35.</p>
