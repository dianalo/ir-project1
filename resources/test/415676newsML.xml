<p>The death toll from an earthquake which rocked Iran's northwestern Ardabil region rose on Monday to 600 as rescue teams searched a mountainous region to assess damage from the second earthquake that hit the area in two days.</p>
<p>An Iranian Red Crescent official told Reuters no reports had been received yet but some casualties were expected in the latest quake measuring 5.2 on the Richter scale.</p>
<p>It struck on Sunday night, two days after a stronger quake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale left 35,000 people homeless in heavy snow and sub-freezing conditions.</p>
<p>Seifollah Vahid Dastjerdi, the head of the Red Crescent, said the death toll of Friday's quake, had risen to 600 and that more than 2,500 were injured.</p>
<p>State-run Tehran radio earlier said Sunday's tremor and its aftershocks destroyed some buildings in areas already damaged on Friday, prompting residents to flee their homes in fear.</p>
<p>"Power has been cut in most towns and villages," it said.</p>
<p>There have been about 350 aftershocks since Friday's quake in Ardabil province on Iran's border with Azerbaijan, the official news agency IRNA said.</p>
<p>Iranian media said units of the army and the Revolutionary Guards had joined about 5,000 relief workers already involved in rescue operations.</p>
<p>Dastjerdi, quoted by IRNA, expressed satisfaction with the pace of relief operations.</p>
<p>He said that so far more than 8,700 tents, 21,800 blankets, 15,300 heaters and lanterns, 2,000 cans of baby formula and 80 tonnes of bread had been distributed to the victims.</p>
<p>Some 60 ambulances, 127 trucks and vans and two helicopters were transferring the injured, relief workers and supplies to and from the stricken region, he said.</p>
<p>Dastjerdi added that Switzerland, Britain, Japan and some international relief organisations had offered to send aid.</p>
<p>Michael Schulenburg, U.N. resident coordinator in Tehran, told Reuters the United Nations was trying to mobilise international assistance which Iran had said it would welcome.</p>
<p>"We have a U.N. team visiting the area today to draw up a complete list of what kind of aid is needed. There is urgent need for food. Also for blankets, water and heaters.</p>
<p>"Conditions are bad and as until last night it was still snowing and access to villages is proving difficult.</p>
<p>"It is very difficult to get a final casualty figure and there are delays because the villages are far away and the weather is not helping. I expect the number to go up but not to the thousands because the area is not a main urban one," Schulenberg said.</p>
<p>Television footage showed scores of people, most of them crying, gathered around an ambulance carrying 10 bodies, including those of six children. Graves were being dug and a Moslem cleric was on hand to pray for the dead.</p>
<p>Ardabil is an agricultural province inhabited mainly by Iran's Azeri minority. It is one of Iran's coldest regions with freezing temperatures during the winter.</p>
<p>In early February, two earthquakes measuring 6.1 and 5.4 on the Richter scale killed at least 79 people and injured 260 in northeastern Iran.</p>
<p>Earthquakes hit Iran regularly. The worst recorded one, measuring 7.3 on the Richter scale, killed 35,000 people in an area near the Caspian coast in 1990.</p>
