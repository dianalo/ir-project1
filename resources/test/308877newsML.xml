<headline>NYMEX electricity ends down with cash, milder temp.</headline>

<p>NYMEX electricity futures settled lower Wednesday in line with weaker cash market prices as the western U.S. began to revive from a cold spell that continued to plague the eastern part of the country.</p>
<p>With the chill migrating eastward, players returned their focus on the ample hydroelectric resources in the Northwest, market sources said.</p>
<p>"Everybody is spilling," said a Northwest futures trader.</p>
<p>The strong river flow, coupled with falling demand, likely triggered another price cut by Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). The federal power marketing agency slashed its prices of firm power for delivery during Thursday shoulder hours by $10.00 per megawatt hour (MWh) to an offer of $30.00.</p>
<p>The BPA price decrease pushed day-ahead prices lower, with peak, firm delivery for Thursday at California-Oregon Border (COB) at $35.00-$40.00 and at Palo Verde (PV) $32.00-$40.00.</p>
<p>February COB futures finished at $15.21/MWh, down 22 cents from Tuesday's settlement. March COB ended unchanged at $12.60 after moving in a 20 cent range.</p>
<p>February Palo Verde (PV) futures finished down 13 cents at $17.35, near its session low of $17.25. March PV was inactive at its Tuesday's settlement of $14.50.</p>
<p>NYMEX February Henry Hub natural gas futures settled up 21.8 cents at $3.611 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>February gas deliveries to the San Juan/Blanco Hub ended at $3.27-$3.31/mmBtu, up from Tuesday's $3.12-$3.17.</p>
<p>In the Pacific Northwest, temperatures would average near normal through Friday, and a cool front would dampen temperatures three to eight degrees below normal. In the Southwest, temperatures would moderate to near normal during the weekend and above normal next week.</p>
<p>NYMEX estimated 170 COB and 100 PV contracts changed hands.</p>
