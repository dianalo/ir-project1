<p>Catering company Compass Group Plc reported an 18 percent increase in its half year profits on Thursday to 56.4 million pounds($92.6 million) on Thursday, and announced the acquisition of caterers to the Wembley football stadium and Oval cricket ground for 11 million pounds.</p>
<p>Pretax profits were exactly in line with a narrow range of forecasts from brokers of 55 to 57 million pounds. The shares dipped 2p to 659p at midday.</p>
<p>Managing director Roger Matthews gave an upbeat outlook for the future in an interview, saying he was confident that current growth rates could be sustained.</p>
<p>"We are basically very confident of continuing our underlying growth rate," said Matthews. The group has achieved an eightfold increase in turnover since 1992 to 2.65 billion at year end 1996 while profits quadrupled over the same period. The group raised its dividend payout 12.7 percent to 3.10p per share.</p>
<p>"We have successfully built up the business over the years and we are now competing with a solid base in each of the international markets."</p>
<p>Matthews said he expected major companies to continue outsourcing their catering. In Britain the group picked up accounts with British Nuclear Fuels, Siemens and a 10 year deal with concert venue the Belfast Waterfront Hall.</p>
<p>In the United States, which showed profits growth of 20 percent to 17.8 million in the half year, outsourcing was especially strong in the healthcare and education foodservice markets.</p>
<p>The U.S. division won catering contracts with the Louisiana State University for 26,000 students and annual turnover of 6.6 million stg.</p>
<p>In mainland Europe, where profits grew 35 percent to 38 million, the group won a contract with Mercedes-Benz for 1,600 staff at five sites, with Villeroy &amp; Boch and Commerzbank Plaza.</p>
<p>"Clearly pressure is on companies to reduce costs and concentrate on their core businesses, and leave catering to the experts and I see no reason why that trend won't continue for many years to come," said Matthews.</p>
<p>He estimates about two thirds of the group's market -- companies, schools and hospitals -- will remain self-catering until the year 2000.</p>
<p>Margins continued to improve, rising from 4 percent to 4.3 percent in the United States and from 3.9 percent to 4.1 percent in mainland Europe.</p>
<p>"We see gradual consistent margin improvement coming through from the main divisions," said Matthews. The group has set longer term targets for margins, to be achieved over the coming years, at 7-7.5 percent in Britain, 5.0-5.5 percent in the United States and 6.0-6.5 percent in mainland Europe.</p>
<p>Margins were also lifted by the introduction of two brands into outlets -- Uppercrust, filled baquettes made by Compass on site, and Ritazza coffee. Trading profit Operating profit from the United States grew 20.3 percent</p>
<p>Turnover rose 40 perecnt to 1.717 billion and dividend increased 12.7 percent to 3.10p per share.</p>
<p>there absolkutley bangin line with what is a narrow consensus. div also in line with forecast. no surprioses in divisional split so 135 for 1997 and 148 for year unlikely to downgrade. ($ = 0.608 British Pounds)</p>
