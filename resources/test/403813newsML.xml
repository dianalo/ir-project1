<p>Canadian bonds closed much weaker in active trade on Wednesday, pulled lower with U.S. Treasuries following hawkish public testimony by U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, analysts said.</p>
<p>"The focus today has been fairly and squarely on the U.S. and everybody else has been carried along," said Jim Webber, director of fixed-income research with TD Securities Inc. "I don't think there's a particular Canadian story here at all."</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year bond fell C$1.50 to C$111.45 to yield 7.036 percent. The U.S. 30-year benchmark bond fell 1-19/32 to yield 6.78 percent.  </p>
<p>The spread between the benchmark bonds narrowed to 26 basis points from 27 basis points at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>Canadian and U.S. bond prices plunged this morning after Greenspan, speaking to the Senate Banking Committee as part of the semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony, said a pre-emptive interest rate hike aimed at controlling inflation could not be ruled out.</p>
<p>Greenspan's hawkish testimony was followed by poorly received five-year bond auctions in Canada and the United States. In Canada, the Bank of Canada sold C$2.7 billion of five-year bonds due September 1, 2002.  </p>
<p>The auction produced an average yield of 5.701 percent and an average price of C$99.064. Bids from primary dealers totalled C$5.9 billion, including C$61.9 million non-competitive tenders at the average yield.</p>
<p>A softer Canadian dollar also figured in Canadian bond market weakness, Webber said. Analysts said the Canadian dollar weakened amid concern that a near-term U.S. rate hike would weaken the currency.</p>
<p>In other prices, the Government of Canada's 7.0 percent bond due 2006 fell C$0.90 to C$104.38 to yield 6.388 percent. The U.S. 10-year bond fell 1-2/32 to yield 6.54 percent.  </p>
<p>The negative spread between the bonds widened to 15 basis points from 14 basis points at the close of trading on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill traded with a yield of 2.92 percent against the U.S. bill which yielded 5.19 percent.</p>
