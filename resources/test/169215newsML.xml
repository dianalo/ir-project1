<p>South African stocks fell for the third day running on Wednesday as anxieties over the recent weakness of the rand and confusion over government policy on exchange controls darkened the market's mood, dealers said.</p>
<p>An early rally, boosted by U.S. election results that matched market predictions, rapidly turned sour and share prices steadily fell to end in the red near their day lows.</p>
<p>"The sentiment is entirely negative so for most stocks prices came down," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The all-share index fell 50.1 points to 6,873.9 as industrials tumbled 56.9 points to 8,091.5.</p>
<p>The market is concerned about apparent contradictory statements from finance minister Trevor Manuel and Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals on whether the government is committed to a phased withdrawal of controls or may be mulling a "big bang" approach.</p>
<p>Trade was light for most of the day until a huge basket trade involving most shares in the top forty index boosted volumes to healthy levels.</p>
<p>Dealers said the trade, linked to an unnamed international broker, was a sign that futures traders were starting to enter the market in preparation for the contracts close-out in December.</p>
<p>"It was a basket deal hedging against futures...futures traders are getting ready for close-out," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Gold shares also had a miserable day as renewed weakness in the bullion price pushed prices down after a resilient few weeks. The gold index finished at 1,702.0, down 2.19 percent or 38.1 points.</p>
<p>Of the major shares Anglos put on 150 cents to 281.25 rand, De Beers lost 100 cents to 138.25 and Richemont dropped 75 cents to 70.50 rand.</p>
<p>Shares in First National Bank, South Africa's third largest bank, were largely unruffled by lower-than-expected earnings per share figures and finished the day off 15 cents to 24.95 rand.</p>
<p>Heavy trade of 4.8 million shares in Con Mining saw the firm's stock rise six cents to 74 cents and trade of 2.8 million shares in Iscor, which has attracted interest all week, saw the group remain unchanged at 329 cents.</p>
<p>In futures initial strong sentiment was also hit by the same woes as the spot market. The all-share December contract was asked at 6,270 from 6,330 with industrials at 7,782/88 from 7,857. The gold contract lost ground to stand at 1,217/27 from 1,250.</p>
