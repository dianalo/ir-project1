<p>Vestacor Ltd said on Wednesday it had acquired a 70 percent stake in Sport 'n Leisure from GP Investments (Pty) Ltd for 4.2 million rand and the issue of 8.8 million Vestacor shares at 35 cents each.</p>
<p>The deal is with effect from March 1, 1997 and the remaining 30 percent will be held by GP Investments. Sport 'n Leisure has 10 outlets in Gauteng and KwaZulu Natal and sells branded sports equipment.</p>
<p>The acquisition is subject to approval by shareholders of the company.</p>
<p>Shareholders were urged to exercise caution in their share dealings as talks were in progress which could affect the share price, the company said.</p>
<p>Following the implementation of the acquisition and reconstitution of the company to Vestacor Ltd (Newco) announced early this month, Vestacor will have a pro forma earnings per share for the year ended February 28, 1997 of 2.5 cents.</p>
<p>This is based on the audited results of Sports and Leisure and assuming that Vestacor's net cash resources of 94.8 million rand after the acquisition were invested to yield a net after tax return of 10.5 percent.</p>
