<p>Japanese refiner Mitsubishi Oil said on Friday its chairman Kikuo Yamada would resign from his post to atone for the firm's involvement in shady oil product deals at the centre of an alleged bribery scandal.</p>
<p>Both Yamada and vice president Masafumi Kishi, who also resigned, will become advisers to the firm effective March 31.</p>
<p>The resignations were not to take management responsibility for Mitsubishi's involvement in the scandal, but to acknowledge its role in "unsettling the public", Mitsubishi Oil president Yoshihiko Izumitani told reporters.</p>
<p>Japanese executives often resign in a symbolic gesture "to take responsibility" for any scandal or corporate embarrassment without admitting any personal or legal culpability.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Oil has been under public scrutiny since last October, when it came to light that the refiner was involved in unusual deals with an Osaka-based oil products wholesaler.</p>
<p>The millionaire oil product wholesaler, Junichi Izui, who was arrested last November on suspicion of evading 330 million yen ($2.72 million) in income taxes on oil trade commissions, has boasted of close ties to high-ranking politicians and bureaucrats who he allegedly wined and dined.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Oil is suspected of having paid a total of about 2.4 billion yen ($19.8 million) in questionable funds to Izui.</p>
<p>Separately on Friday, an internal investigation by the Trade Ministry revealed that a former ministry official approached power utilities about buying fuel oil from Mitsubishi Oil.</p>
<p>The former official is believed to have acted on behalf of Izui, Jiji news agency quoted Trade Minister Shinji Sato as telling parliament.</p>
<p>The arrest of the Osaka oil dealer prompted a ministry survey which revealed that more than 100 bureaucrats had dined, had drinks, or played golf with Izui, and several senior civil servants have been disciplined over the case.</p>
<p>Media reports say Mitsubishi Oil's ties with Izui deepened while Yamada was serving as president of the firm for five years until June 1994.</p>
<p>Yamada has been questioned by the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office in relation to Mitsubishi Oil's business with Izui.</p>
<p>He is known in the oil industry for his aggressive management style and a global strategy reflecting his strong desire to take the lead in Vietnam's fledgling oil exploration.</p>
<p>Mitsubishi Oil has taken a stake in Vietnam's promising upstream oil business since as early as 1992, when it was still rare for conservative Japanese oil firms to take an active role in overseas oil development.</p>
<p>In a statement read by Mitsubishi's president Izumitani, Yamada expressed sorrow over his resignation.</p>
<p>"It is deeply regretable that I have to resign without fulfilling my goals... I strongly hope that the company will prosper, as a trustworthy firm, as quickly as possible," his statement read.</p>
<p>Oil industry sources have speculated that the scandal-tainted image of Mitsubishi Oil has stalled an agreement to merge its refining and distribution units with those of Showa Shell Sekiyu KK.</p>
<p>Showa Shell, owned 50 percent by the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, has said it is considering such a deal.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Mitsubishi Oil revised its parent current profit forecast for the fiscal year to March 31 to a loss of 9.50 billion yen ($78.5 million) from a previous forecast of 8 billion yen ($66.1 million) profit. ($=121 yen)</p>
