<p>Fast bowler Ed Giddins, barred from first class cricket for 20 months after testing positive for cocaine, is to appeal against the ban, Lord's officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Richard Little, the Test and County Cricket Board's spokesman, said Lord's had received a letter stating simply that the cricketer would be appealing. No further detail was included in it.</p>
<p>Giddins, who toured Pakistan with England A last winter, was sacked by his club Sussex after the TCCB's discipline committee cancelled his registration last month and banned him until April 1998.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old player has refused to comment on his decision, other than to confirm he has taken legal advice.</p>
<p>Giddins had hoped to rebuild his career by playing abroad during the suspension, but he has been unable to find a club so far.</p>
<p>"In the light of the ban I have found it extremely difficult to get a club overseas," he said. "I'm a cricketer, that is my trade, that's how I earn a living and it's something I want to do."</p>
