<p>First Union Corp said it has launched a new cash management product for small and mid-sized businsses.</p>
<p>First Union said the minimum balance a company needs to participate in its "All in One" program is $50,000, half the traditional threshold at other banks for a similar service.</p>
<p>First Union said the program is designed to help small and mid-sized businesses maximize the return on their cash assets by sweeping idle funds into overnight investments at the end of each day.</p>
<p>Customers can get account information through an online service known as PC InVision or through Business Fax, which sends a daily statement via facsimile by 0800 each day.</p>
<p>First Union said it named Frank Carter as the Cash Management Division's market segment manager for small and mid-sized businesses.</p>
