<p>Analysts welcomed the announcement on Monday by Dutch group Nedlloyd NV of a merger of its container shipping with Britain's Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc (P&amp;O) but said the futures of the firms' global alliances now appeared uncertain.</p>
<p>"At first glance, I'm absolutely positive," said Richard Brakenhoff, transport analyst at MeesPierson.</p>
<p>In an industry with strong economies of scale, analysts said it was inevitable that companies move beyond global alliances to outright mergers and, as the first in the sector to do so, Nedlloyd and P&amp;O would be the first to reap cost savings.</p>
<p>The companies said they expected to make cost savings of $200 million a year, partly with the loss of 1,400 jobs.</p>
<p>"The cost savings are much higher than Nedlloyd has so far been making with its Global Alliance. I'm very positive, but of course the competition will not disappear because of this," said Pieter van Gelder, analyst at Delta Lloyd Bank.</p>
<p>Nedlloyd works within a global shipping consortium with American President Lines (APL), Mitsui OSK Lines and Orient Overseas Container Line.</p>
<p>Analysts added that they expect the two companies' different client bases would complement each other.</p>
<p>"From a logistical point of view, it makes sense. Nedlloyd is strong in South America and number one on the Europe-Far East route. P&amp;O are very strong in the Far East and Middle East," said Gert Jochems, analyst at NIB Strating Securities.</p>
<p>However, the analysts said there were still question marks over the repercussions for Nedlloyd's Global Alliance and P&amp;O's own involvment in a grand alliance of international shipping companies.</p>
<p>"They can't be in both alliances. There will have to be some reshuffling," said Jochems.</p>
