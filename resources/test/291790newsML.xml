<p>Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman and Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti on Tuesday discussed regional developments and bilateral ties, Gulf news agencies reported.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Oman's Deputy Prime Minister for Cabinet Affairs Fahd bin Mahmoud al-Said met Kabariti, who arrived in Muscat late on Monday to attend joint higher committee talks on bilateral cooperation.</p>
<p>Both men also discussed the stalled Middle East peace process and stressed the need to solve issues blocking its progress, the agencies added.</p>
<p>The election of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in May slammed brakes on the five-year-old U.S.-led peace process.</p>
<p>Arabs have criticised Netanyahu's government for its decision to grant financial benefits to Jewish settlers in the occupied West bank and its failure to implement an agreement to withdraw its forces from the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994, but official ties with the Jewish state have recently been strained by Netanyahu's hardline policies.</p>
<p>Oman, which together with Qatar have gone further than all other Gulf Arab states to establish ties with Israel, said in Deceber it had frozen ties with the Jewish state.</p>
