<p>The dollar's nosedive against the yen has put some Asian monetary authorities on alert for what it means for their currencies.</p>
<p>As most Asian currencies are pegged to both the dollar and the yen, the challenge during a time of turbulence like now is to work out which of the standard-bearers to follow.</p>
<p>A stronger yen means Asian exports become cheaper and more competitive against Japanese rivals, but only if they can keep their own currencies from rising against the dollar.</p>
<p>As this week ends, the dollar has taken nearly a five yen dive in just six trading days from its recent peak and traded as low as 122.56 yen in Tokyo on Friday.</p>
<p>But there are signs Asian monetary authorities do not want to see their currencies follow the lead of the yen and gain ground because it would cut into the benefits of more exports.</p>
<p>The central Bank of Korea (BOK) stepped into the won/dollar interbank market on Friday, buying dollars at 891.20 won.</p>
<p>Dealers said the central bank was seen intervening as the falling dollar against the yen prompted the won's rise. They said the central bank wanted to slow the rise of the won.</p>
<p>BOK assistant governor Shim Hoon earlier said the dollar would stay above the current 890 won level, if the dollar/yen rate did not fall further.</p>
<p>"Unless the dollar/yen rate drops further from the current level, there is no reason for the dollar to fall below the 890 won mark," he said.</p>
<p>Asian currencies are loosely pegged to the dollar but some have recently shown strong synchronisation against the yen.</p>
<p>Recent statistics show, for example, that when the yen appreciates by one percent, the won rises by 0.3 percent.</p>
<p>"South Korea is suffering a record large current account deficit and it is natural for them to try to avoid a won appreciation that is automatically caused by a dollar plunge " said C.H. Kwan, senior economist at Nomura Research Institute.</p>
<p>Kwan believes a steeper dollar fall against the yen would benefit Asian economies.</p>
<p>"There is a strong co-relation between Asian economic growth and the yen-dollar rate," he said.</p>
<p>"Economic growth in Asia has already slowed down since early last year and the major reason for that is the weaker yen."</p>
<p>With the current dollar/yen level, which is still high compared with around a 107 yen average last year, Japanese exports can still grow.</p>
<p>"But when the yen appreciates much more against the dollar, Asian economic growth picks up because of the larger inflow of investment from Japan as they gain export competitiveness against Japanese products in international markets," Kwan said.</p>
<p>This is because Asian currencies are much more heavily pegged to the dollar than they are to the yen.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Bank of Thailand intervened in Singapore foreign exchange markets on Friday to sell dollars at 26.025 baht after the Thai unit came under intense selling pressure due partly to a rumour, later denied, of a band widening.</p>
<p>The Thai baht has weakened due to lingering worries over its financial sector, weak Thai stocks and a weak economy.</p>
<p>Traders said the Thai bank's action was to alleviate market pessimism over the economy and risks in the banking sector.</p>
<p>Ken Kawai, manager of the at Asian currency group at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said: "The dollar tumbled against the yen Friday, so its fall against the baht could have been be more significant. But in the mid term, weak Thai stocks, along with U.S. investors' consistent interest in buying dollars for baht, are supporting the dollar (versus the baht)."</p>
