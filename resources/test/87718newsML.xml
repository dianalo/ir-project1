<p>World prices for industrial metals took another dive on Tuesday as consumers around the globe backed off and waited for lower values.</p>
<p>With order books more empty than they had expected earlier in 1996, they can afford to live hand-to-mouth, analysts said.</p>
<p>"Most economies still appear to be bedevilled by high raw material stocks as well as finished product inventories," said Robin Bhar of London Metal Exchange (LME) ring dealers Brandeis.</p>
<p>"The consumers' own order levels are not that strong."</p>
<p>On the LME prices for aluminium fell to 2-1/4 year lows, lead slumped to a fresh seven-month nadir, tin was its weakest for sixteen months and nickel fell to a two-month low.</p>
<p>Flagship copper extended recent sharp losses, and only zinc showed a semblance of stability.</p>
<p>The woeful performance came on the first day of the last quarter of 1996, traditionally the strongest period for demand following the seasonal summer slowdown.</p>
<p>"This is traditionally a good period for demand, but you could be forgiven for thinking it was still summer," Bhar said.</p>
<p>While demand was sluggish, production of some metals, particularly copper, was on the increase, leaving plentiful supplies in the pipeline.</p>
<p>On Tuesday values were hit by speculator and fund sales.</p>
<p>Traders saw Tuesday's selling as a mix of long liquidation and fresh short position taking, sparked by copper's weakness.</p>
<p>"To some extent it is a pure sentiment play," said one floor dealer. "People want to sell copper and that spills over everywhere else. If you are going to play the market you play it from the short side."</p>
<p>Benchmark three month copper futures fell to $1,890 at one stage before recovering slightly to $1,900 by midday, still down $28 from Monday. The market peaked at $1,990 last week.</p>
<p>This week's losses came despite a fall in LME copper stocks on Tuesday. They declined 7,825 tonnes, over three percent.</p>
<p>But traders said the drop represented arbitrage and spread trading opportunities more than genuine demand from its big users, the transport, electrical and telecommunications sectors.</p>
<p>Aluminium, used by the packaging and transportation industries, hit a 2-1/4 year low of $1,357 from $1,377.50 on Monday after stocks fell by a modest 950 tonnes.</p>
<p>The smaller turnover markets also suffered from the general base metals malaise.</p>
<p>Tin bottomed at $5,900, the lowest level since May 1995 and lead, undermined by slow offtake from the vehicle battery producers, hit a seven-month nadir of $745.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts were expecting a bounce in the metals complex in the short term, with profit-taking and short-covering helping to lift markets off the lows.</p>
<p>But they were less sanguine in the longer term. Global economic growth was expected to continue in 1997, lifting demand for metals. But the recovery was likely to be muted.</p>
<p>"For 1997 I am slightly more bullish than I am now," Brandeis' Bhar said.</p>
<p>"But the upturn in economies we are seeing in the 1990s is less of a sharp one than those we saw in the 1980s and 1970s."</p>
<p>"We can expect to see rather modest pick-ups (in metals demand next year), and not the sort of rebound associated with a synchronised robust upturn in economic activity noted in the past," said brokers Billiton Metals in their latest report.</p>
