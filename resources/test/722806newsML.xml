<p>Floods triggered by heavy rain have killed at least 22 people in southeastern Bangladesh, police and officials said on Friday. They said at least 30 people were injured, hundreds could be missing and tens of thousands were made homeless in Chittagong, Cox's Bazar and the nearby hill districts  </p>
<p>"Most of the victims died in mudslides and a few were swept away by torrents of floodwater," one official said. "The death toll may go up as it is still raining heavily. Communications with many areas have been cut off," he said.</p>
<p>Major rivers in the southeast have burst their banks while rivers in other areas were also rising fast, meteorology officials said. Unless the rain stops in the next 24 hours much of the country would be inundated, one official said.</p>
