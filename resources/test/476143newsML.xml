<headline>TWA sees higher Q1 oper loss than year ago.</headline>

<p>Trans World Airlines Inc on Monday said it expected its first-quarter operating loss to exceed its operating loss in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The carrier, which is expected to announce first-quarter results in April, posted an operating loss of $54.2 million in the first quarter of 1996 and a net loss of $37.1 million, or $0.89 a share.</p>
<p>In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, TWA also said its consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of 1996 was $181.6 million, down from $304.3 million on December 31, 1995.  </p>
<p>The seventh-largest U.S. carrier said its balances in the first quarter are typically lower than in other periods because of seasonal factors. TWA said such seasonal factors and the expected first-quarter loss will bring cash balances to a level significantly below the balance on December 31.</p>
<p>Last week, TWA said its independent audit would issue a qualification on the airline's ability to continue as a going concern. In the filing Monday, KPMG Peat Marwick LLP confirmed that TWA's recurring losses and its limited sources of fresh cash raised substantial doubts about its future as a going concern.  </p>
<p>To be sure, TWA, which has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection twice since 1992, is taking steps to raise cash. Earlier this month, it sold a five percent stake to Saudi Arabian billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal. On Monday, it closed a private placement of $50 million in secured notes.</p>
<p>The carrier is also looking for new projects to expand its cash-generating opportunities. It is installing automatic ticket machines in some markets and selling tickets on the Internet in the second quarter. The moves would reduce the carrier's ticket-distribution costs, TWA said in the filing.  </p>
<p>The company also signed an agreement with a group of St. Louis businesses, which will buy $26 million of tickets for business travel on TWA flights.</p>
<p>In addition, TWA is considering entering a marketing and code-sharing alliance with foreign carriers, though further details were not available.</p>
<p>A TWA spokesman confirmed that management did not believe the resolution of claims related to the crash of TWA Flight 800 last July would have a material adverse effect on the carrier's financial condition or operational results.  </p>
<p>The company said management had no reason to believe its insurance coverage would not be sufficient to cover whatever claims arose from the incident.</p>
<p>TWA shares closed up 2/16 at 6-15/16 on Monday.</p>
