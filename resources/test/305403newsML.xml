<text>
<p>Abundant supply of kuna funds pushed the Croatian average lending rate down to 9.8 percent on Tuesday from 12 percent.</p>
<p>Trade totalled 33.1 million kuna, with 36.9 million surplus left on the supply side. But dealers said demand was not met in full as borrowers and lenders failed to agree on terms.</p>
<p>Most of some 13.8 million kuna of fresh loans were call money borrowings at a steady 11 percent.</p>
<p>Term rates ranged between 10 percent for seven-day insurers' money and 16 for one-month interbank funds. Insurers rolled over previous short-term loans at 9.0 percent.</p>
<p>The central bank calculated the kuna midrates for Wednesday at 5.6533 versus 5.6346 to the dollar and little changed at 3.5589 against the German mark. -- Laura Lui, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075</p>
