<p>Heavy mortar fire from Pakistani troops across the Himalayan border with India forced people to abandon their homes in the northern Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir, officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>There were no casualties, they said. Rockets and missiles were also used in the intermittent attacks on the Kargil region of mountainous Ladakh on Wednesday evening, the officials added.</p>
<p>But a Pakistani Defence Ministry spokesman said nothing unusual had occurred in the area. He said exchanges of fire were a routine matter.</p>
<p>The report of the firing was an uneasy footnote to the first meeting since 1994 of the two south Asian neighbours' foreign ministers in New Delhi on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The talks had raised hopes that the old foes were on the path to peace.</p>
<p>India and Pakistan have fought two of their three wars since independence from Britain in 1947 over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, of which India controls two-thirds and Pakistan the remainder.</p>
<p>Indian and Pakistani troops frequently exchange fire across the Line of Control and the "working" border.</p>
<p>The "working" border between India and Pakistan stretches 174 km (109 miles) between the Chenab and Ravi rivers to join up in the north with the Line of Control, or ceasefire line, dividing Kashmir.</p>
