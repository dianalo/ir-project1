<p>UK meals and feeds closed quietly and unchanged again due to many traders being absent to attend the annual European commodities trade fair in Antwerp.</p>
<p>A mixed close on the Chicago soybean meal futures left those traders not attending the trade fair uncertain over the UK market's next direction.</p>
<p>"The market was basically dead today. On Monday we'll take a look at how Chicago finished tonight and take it from there," one trader said.</p>
