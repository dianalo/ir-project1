<p>Taiwan share prices closed sharply higher on Saturday as investors hunted for bargains following Friday's tumble, brokers said.</p>
<p>The weighted index shrugged off early-session malaise to finish 127.67 points or 1.56 percent higher at 8,314.67.</p>
<p>Turnover was an active T$93.2 billion.</p>
<p>The index, hit by concerns that the shares were overvalued, had plunged by 298.66 points or 3.52 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>"Friday's plunge was huge, and naturally some people took the opportunity to buy lower-priced stocks today (Saturday)," said Allen Huang, analyst for National Securities.  </p>
<p>Brokers, however, said the market would remain in a downward consolidation despite Saturday's rebound.</p>
<p>"One session of gains would not change the overall trend, because the rise was merely a technical one," the National's Huang said.</p>
<p>Electronic shares led Saturday's session by rising 3.04 percent. Both Inventec Corp and Microtek International soaring by the daily seven-percent limit or T$21 and T$5.50 respectively to T$322 and T$86.</p>
<p>The heavily weighted financial sector rose 1.12 percent.  </p>
<p>Taiwan's stock market had been one of the world's hottest performers in 1997. The index had risen 27 percent this year before dropping in a downward correction on April 28.</p>
<p>A 8,250-8,350 range was seen for Monday.</p>
