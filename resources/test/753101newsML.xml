<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle sales Thursday were light at $64.00 per cwt, unchanged from active trading on Wednesday, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>About 1,500 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area, which brought the weekly movement near 131,000, they said. An estimated 3,500 head sold in Kansas and brought the week's movement near 95,000, the sources said.</p>
<p>Most showlists were sold out in the Panhandle and Kansas, which has allowed many feedlots to remain current, they said.</p>
<p>Sales at $64.00 kept pace with last week's fairly active trade at the same level.  </p>
<p>Cattle owners had anticipated higher prices amid firm beef values, but sold at $64.00 when beef movement slowed and prices appeared ready to slip, market sources said.</p>
<p>Packer buying at the $64.00 level was persistent and strong, which suggested some were shorter on live inventory than expected, the sources said. Once cattle started trading on Wednesday, packers remained active buyers until many feedlots had sold out their showlists, cattle feeders said.</p>
<p>"They pretty much had their minds made up that they were going to buy everything they could at $64.00," one Kansas feeldot manager said.</p>
