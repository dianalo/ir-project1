<p>The European Parliament cleared controversial rules on Thursday for marketing and labelling genetically modified and other "novel" foods in the European Union.</p>
<p>A large majority of Euro-MPs voted in favour of the legislation, despite criticism from environmental groups that its labelling requirements were too lax.</p>
<p>The vote, 339 to 60, was critical since the parliament had the power to block the legislation.</p>
<p>The parliament's move was welcomed by a biotechnology industry group, EuropaBio, which said it was a "vital" piece of legislation that would make industry more confident about how to bring new foods to the market.</p>
<p>But it was blasted by the environmental group Greenpeace, which has led Europe-wide protests against gene-modified crops and foods. It called it a "slap in the face for European consumers".</p>
<p>Genetic engineering allows beer to ferment faster, cheese to mature quicker, pigs to grow larger, tomatoes to age more slowly and cereals to resist pests.</p>
<p>Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, a German Socialist who was in charge of the legislation, told the assembly the final compromise -- worked out with EU governments -- was inadequate but urged Euro-MPs to accept it rather than leave a legal vacuum.</p>
<p>Her report argued that consumers, manufacturers and traders all wanted binding EU-wide rules on labelling novel foods and that even imperfect legislation was better than a situation in which the EU had a single market but 15 different national laws.</p>
<p>The regulation, which directly replaces national rules, requires manufacturers to indicate to consumers when a product contains a "live" genetically altered element -- that is, one that can grow if given soil or water.</p>
<p>They will also have to label novel foods shown by scientific analysis to be significantly different from conventional foods. The wording of these labels will be largely left up to the manufacturers.</p>
<p>Foods produced using genetically altered raw materials which are no longer present in the final product, such as milk from cows fed on genetically modified grains, will not be labelled.</p>
<p>The regulation says bulk deliveries containing both conventional and genetically modified types of soya, maize and other goods do not have to be labelled, so long as "information for consumers on the possibility that genetically modified organisms may be present" is provided.</p>
<p>Producers can market novel foods which are "essentially equivalent" to traditional ones so long as they notify the European Commission. These will not be labelled and will not go through rigorous health and safety tests before authorisation.</p>
<p>Andrew Dickson, secretary general of EuropaBio, said the legislation would increase transparency and give consumers more confidence.</p>
<p>"It will certainly clarify the situation," he told Reuters. "Industry will be more confident now of the basis on which novel foods can be brought to the market."</p>
<p>But Greenpeace cited a survey released last week showing that 59 percent of Danes, Dutch, Frenchmen, Britons, Italians and Swedes opposed genetically engineered foods.</p>
