<p>Britain must take an active part in shaping Europe and the move towards European Economic and Monetary Union, or inward investment will suffer, the chairman of the Anglo-Dutch Unilever said.</p>
<p>"If the UK continues to create the impression that it may opt out of the European mainstream this will adversely affect inward investment," said Niall Fitzgerald, who is also chairman of the Confederation of British Industry's Europe Committee.</p>
<p>He made the statement in response to a query from Reuters about his reaction to remarks made by Toyota president Hiroshi Okuda on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Okuda said Toyota, which employs 2,000 people in Britain, had no plans to scale back its current level of investment in Britain but would favour putting new investment elsewhere in Europe if Britain chose to remain outside EMU.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald's words echoed a warning he gave to the CBI conference in November when he said that, in the longer term, opting out of the single currency was not an option.</p>
<p>Fitzgerald is one of a number of company executives who have been meeting with opposition Labour Party leader Tony Blair to talk about economic and industry policy.</p>
