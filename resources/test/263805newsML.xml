<p>De Beers on Wednesday gave the Russian government until the end of 1996 to sign a diamond trade agreement and said that otherwise it would terminate its interim agreement.</p>
<p>"We are publicly announcing that if there is no progress by the end of the year, our agreement will terminate on that date," Raymond Clarke, general director of De Beers's Russia representation, told a news conference.  </p>
<p>"There have been major leakages of gems and diamonds outside our agreement," Clarke said. "This year the leakages have been substantial -- they may or may not have been less than last year."</p>
<p>De Beers is keen for tighter control over the leakage of Russian gems on to world markets.</p>
<p>"Finally and reluctantly we came to the conclusion that we could no longer live with an agreement that de facto was no longer in force," he said.</p>
<p>Russia and De Beers have been in protracted talks to reach a new agreement to market Russian rough diamonds through De Beers's Central Selling Organisation.</p>
<p>De Beers controls about three quarters of the world diamond market and Russia accounts for about 25 percent of all gems De Beers sells so delays to the deal have worried gem watchers.</p>
<p>De Beers signed a memorandum of understanding with Russia in February but has yet to sign a formal trade agreement.</p>
<p>Clarke said that De Beers had informed the Russian government in October that it would not be prepared to buy Russian diamonds under the draft agreement through December of this year.</p>
<p>Clarke said the Russian government had not replied. "We have had not one official statement made from the government," Clarke said.</p>
<p>He said that if the leakages had not taken place De Beers would have probably continued with an interim trade agreement based on the February memorandum with Russia.</p>
<p>"It is a matter of conjecture where the leakages came from," Clarke said.</p>
