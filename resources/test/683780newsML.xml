<p>The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday prepared to vote on China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trade status with China as supporters expressed optimism that lawmakers would back U.S. President Bill Clinton's decision to maintain normal trade relations.</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Dick Armey, a Texan Republican, predicted the House would approve by a healthy majority Clinton's decision to renew China's Most Favoured Nation trade status.</p>
<p>The U.S. House vote, just six days before Hong Kong reverts to Chinese control, was on a resolution sponsored by Representative Gerald Solomon, Republican of New York, that would overturn Clinton's decision to renew normal trade relations with China for another year.</p>
<p>"Jerry Solomon's resolution (to overturn Clinton's decision) will fail, probably by a decisive vote ... I don't think it is going to be down to a handful of votes," Armey told reporters as debate on the resolution began.</p>
<p>Opponents of maintaining normal trade relations with Beijing argued that Clinton's policy of engagement has failed to end human rights abuses, religious repression, technology transfers or reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit with China.</p>
<p>"We all agree the U.S. China relationship is an important one and we all want a brilliant future with the Chinese people," Representative Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, argued. "However the administration's policy of so-called constructive engagement is neither constructive nor true engagement."</p>
<p>She said there has been a "marked deterioration, not improvement" in the areas of human rights, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and in the trade balance with China. She said the $40 billion U.S. trade deficit with China could widened to $53 billion this year.</p>
<p>But supporters of Clinton's decision argued that cutting off normal trade ties would most likely do little to improve human rights in China and could end up backfiring on the United States and hurt Hong Kong at a time when it most needs U.S. support.</p>
<p>House Ways and Means trade subcommittee Chairman Philip Crane, an Illinois Republican, told his fellow lawmakers that 50 percent of China's exports to the United States and 49 percent of U.S. exports to China flow through the British colony which will revert to Chinese rule on Jule 1.</p>
<p>"Denying MFN to China would threaten 70,000 jobs in Hong Kong," Crane said. "At this extraordinarily delicate time, the people of Hong Kong deserve our steady and strong support for renewing China's MFN status."</p>
<p>He argued that the United States can have more influence on Beijing's policy by maintaining normal relations and noted the successful effort by the U.S. trade negotiators last year to reach agreement with Beijing to protect U.S. copyrights from pirating and other intellectual property in China through the use of targeted trade sanctions.</p>
<p>Representative Cal Dooley, a California Democrat, said he expected more than 50 percent of House Democrats to vote for extending MFN and said the final tally in favour of extending could be in the range of 240 to 250 votes. Supporters only need a simple majority, or 218 votes, to continue MFN for an additional year.</p>
<p>Last year, the House backed MFN for China by a vote of 286-141.</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, the president must decide each year whether to grant China MFN, and Congress has the right to disapprove his decision. Without MFN, duties on imports from China would soar to an average of 44 percent from a current level of about six percent. Most favoured nation status is enjoyed by almost every other country.</p>
<p>Some members of Congress have been reconsidering support for MFN because of reports of Chinese human rights abuses, nuclear technology and missile transfers, and allegations that Beijing tried to influence U.S. elections by illegal campaign contributions. Lawmakers have also expressed concern about the fate of Hong Kong after it returns to Chinese rule.</p>
