<p>Adam Slomka, head of one party in Poland's opposition Solidarity Election Action (AWS), said on Thursday that people with more than $500,000 should have to disclose the origins of their wealth, PAP news agency reported.</p>
<p>"They should produce documents showing the source from which their money comes," the agency reported Slomka, head of the Confederation for an Independent Poland -- Patriotic Camp (KPN-OP), as saying.</p>
<p>"Undocumented wealth should be spent on purposes indicated by the state treasury," Slomka was reported as telling a PAP reporter in the western city Gorzow Wielkopolski.</p>
<p>The KPN-OP is one of dozens of small rightist parties which have formed the AWS alliance around the Solidarity trade union in hopes of winning parliamentary polls due around September.</p>
<p>Slomka, one of the few rightists to enter parliament in the 1993 polls, when the present ruling coalition of ex-communists and a Peasant party swept to power, is among more than 20 members of the AWS national coordinating team.</p>
<p>PAP said he admitted his idea was seen as controversial by some other members of the AWS, which has yet to publish a programme and whose member parties have widely differing views.</p>
<p>Slomka said a newly-rich class which had emerged when many state assets were privatised after the 1989 fall of communism presented a bigger menace than people who had secretly collaborated with the old communist security police.</p>
<p>Dealing with them was therefore a more important theme for the AWS election campaign than its current high priority of calling for former police informers to be exposed.</p>
<p>The AWS spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment on whether Slomka's proposal for so-called "economic vetting" had any wider backing within the alliance, which is dominated by the Solidarity trade union.</p>
<p>Right-leaning parties have long argued that much of Poland's wealth has been snapped up by people who used links with the network of old communist officials to acquire former state firms cheaply at the expense of other Poles.</p>
<p>Solidarity disagrees with Poland's past policies on privatisation -- selling firms off to strategic investors or in a limited mass privatisation of around 500 firms -- and wants a more sweeping distribution of remaining state wealth. -- Anthony Barker +48 22 653 9700</p>
