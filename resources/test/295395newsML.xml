<p>World Formula One champion Damon Hill is confident he can finish on the winner's podium with his new team, Arrows.</p>
<p>Hill, making a special appearance at an international motor show to show off the new Arrows Yamaha A18 car on which his season's hopes rest, said on Thursday: "I know I can win in this car.</p>
<p>"I've been through a good period celebrating the championship but I've had enough champagne and I'm now raring to get back on the track and start racing again.</p>
<p>"The car's very slim, very impressive...It's a state-of-the-art piece of machinery."</p>
<p>But how the car competes with the leading F1 teams, including Williams who did not renew Hill's contract after his title-winning season, remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Hill, replaced at Williams by Heinz-Harald Frentzen, is cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a lot of hard work but I've never been more motivated and I still want to win races," he said.</p>
<p>"I've got an incredible winning record and I certainly don't want to see that dwindle."</p>
<p>Hill said he was under no illusions about the task facing him when the F1 season started in Melbourne on March 9.</p>
<p>"I enjoyed incredible success last season and it's going to be a step backwards to start with in order to go forward."</p>
<p>Testing of the Arrows will start next week at Silverstone and then Hill and the team will fly out for a month's testing in southern Spain.</p>
<p>"I'll be doing as much of the testing myself as I can," said Hill. "I need to get to know the Arrows engineers and get to understand the car."</p>
