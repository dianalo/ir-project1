<p>Kuwait's defence minister arrived in Oman on Wednesday on the final leg of a lightning tour of the region to garner support among 1991 Gulf War allies for a fresh U.S. military build-up in the region.</p>
<p>Sheikh Ahmad Hamoud al-Jaber al-Sabah was scheduled to meet Oman's ruler, Sultan Qaboos bin Said, and deliver a letter from Kuwait's emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah, the official Oman News Agency said. It gave no further details.</p>
<p>The Kuwaiti defence minister arrived in Muscat after brief stops in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) earlier in the day.</p>
<p>His visit to Oman marks the end of his shuttle mission to Kuwait's five Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) partners aimed at reaffirming the old anti-Iraq coalition.</p>
<p>The GCC is an economic, political and military alliance which groups Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and the UAE. On Tuesday Sheikh Ahmad visited regional heavyweight Saudi Arabia, the island state of Bahrain, and Qatar.</p>
<p>Kuwait on Monday agreed to receive more U.S. soldiers and stressed it would not hesitate to take further measures to deter what its sees as threats by former occupier Iraq.</p>
