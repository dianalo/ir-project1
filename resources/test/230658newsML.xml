<p>Zairean rebels captured the town of Bunia in northeastern Zaire, routing Zairean troops on the rampage, refugees and Ugandan army sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The rebels said earlier they seized Bunia and Walikale to the west but there was no independent confirmation of the fall of Walikale as panicked foreigners pulled out of the region.</p>
<p>"Bunia has fallen to the Zairean rebels. That is our understanding of the situation," said a Ugandan military source in the Ugandan town of Kasese, 165 km (100 miles) to the south.</p>
<p>Zairean refugees among 3,000 who fled to Kasese said Zairean soldiers looted Bunia, beat up residents and raped many women before the town fell to the advancing rebels on Monday night.</p>
<p>"The Banyamulenge (rebels) have taken over Bunia. Zairean soldiers have fled from the area and we do not known where they have gone," said a refugee who arrived in Kasese on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We chose to come to Uganda because Zairean soldiers are looting and raping as they flee the Banyamulenge," she added.</p>
<p>Bunia, 370 km (230 miles) north of the rebel capital Goma, is the northernmost town confirmed to have fallen into rebel hands. They now control towns across a front 550 km (340 miles) long from north to south, parallel with Zaire's eastern borders.</p>
<p>The Ugandan military source said rebels on Tuesday were clearing pockets of resistance in Bunia. Zaire's government accuses Ugandan troops of fighting alongside Tutsi rebels.</p>
<p>Some of the refugees at Kasese said they heard armed men speaking Ugandan languages inside Zaire but they could not tell if they were regular Ugandan government troops.</p>
<p>Ugandan Army Commander Major-General Mugisha Muntu said on Tuesday that Ugandan troops had crossed only three km (two miles) into Zaire and "annihilated" Ugandan rebels based there before pulling back.</p>
<p>Zairean rebel officer Jean Kabongo, special security adviser to rebel leader Laurent Kabila, told Reuters in the eastern city of Goma that both Bunia and Walikale had fallen to rebel forces.</p>
<p>Missionary sources reported shooting in Bunia on Monday.</p>
<p>Rebels at the weekend seized Beni, 220 km (135 miles) north of Goma. Bunia is 140 km (90 miles) northeast of Beni and Walikale is 130 km (80 miles) northwest of Goma, on the road to Kisangani.</p>
<p>Kabongo said on Monday the rebel Alliance of Democratic Forces had captured parts of Kisangani city, the biggest in the region, but aid agencies said it remained in government hands.</p>
<p>The officer repeated his claim on Tuesday. "We are in and around Kisangani...There will be a big combat for Kisangani but our forces have been there, around it, for a month," he said.</p>
<p>On Monday both Kabila and Kabongo said Walikale was giving the rebel forces trouble. Kabongo said they had bypassed it to reach Kisangani, site of a major air base and the government's most likely rallying point in any counter-offensive.</p>
<p>Aid agency sources said one aid organisation, Aviation sans Frontieres, was pulling out of Kisangani after its planes came under fire on Monday and Zairean reinforcements were arriving.</p>
<p>The United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF said it pulled its last two personnel out of Kisangani on Monday to the Zairean capital Kinshasa and the move was related to the insecurity.</p>
<p>"UNICEF is very concerned about the security situation in Kisangani," said Steven Allen, UNICEF representative in Kinshasa. "On Monday staff reported shooting between different elements of the Zairean army, apparently sparked by the arrival of wounded and dead Zairean soldiers from Beni," he added.</p>
<p>Another aviation charity, Mission Aviation Fellowship, said on Tuesday it had evacuated its planes and personnel from the town of Niakunde, 25 km (15 miles) west of Bunia, for fear of trouble as ill-disciplined Zairean troops retreat in disarray.</p>
<p>"We're also hearing that the DSP (Division Speciale Presidentielle) has been sent up to Kisangani to disarm the government soldiers," a missionary source said.</p>
<p>The DSP is the special and well-equipped military unit assigned to protect President Mobutu Sese Seko, who is recovering from illness at his villa in the south of France.</p>
<p>The rebellion broke out in October among Zaireans of Rwandan origin whom the government threatened to repatriate, along with more than a million Rwandan Hutu refugees who took refuge in Zaire after the genocide of Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994.</p>
<p>The fighting has dispersed hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees and displaced Zaireans into the countryside. Canada is trying to lead a multinational force to find and help them.</p>
<p>In Rwanda's capital Kigali, the U.S. army said its aerial reconnaissance had had located a maximum of 170,000 refugees in a strip 100 km (60 miles) wide west of the Rwandan border.</p>
<p>"We think there are 170,000 people in eastern Zaire that we consider to be refugees," Major Marty Schweitzer told a news conference at which U.S. aerial photographs were displayed.</p>
<p>But more than two weeks after the U.N. Security Council launched the multinational force, a mere 200 or so Canadians are in the region and are a long way from where food may be needed.</p>
