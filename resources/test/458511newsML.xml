<p>The stock Exchange said on Friday that it will launch its bourse index on April 2.</p>
<p>"The index from then on will serve as an indicator of Latvia's stock market, also tracking the development trends of its economy," the bourse said in a statement.</p>
<p>The index was prepared in co-operation with Dow Jones, which makes it the first Dow Jones index in the Eastern Europe and former Soviet countries, the bourse said.</p>
<p>"On behalf of the international financial world, the index can also be considered as a sign of trust in the development of Latvia's economy," the statement added.</p>
<p>More detailed information about the index will be issued next week, the bourse said.</p>
<p>The index, based on capitalisation data, is expected to track the top 10 most active stocks on the Riga market.</p>
<p>Latvian commercial bank indices, including Rietumu Bank and Saules bank, were introduced earlier this year.</p>
