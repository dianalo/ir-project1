<p>Intelligroup Inc said it cancelled its proposed offering of 1.35 million shares of common stock and that it secured a two-year $7.5 million revolving line of credit from PNC Bank.</p>
<p>The company said it cancelled the offering because market conditions did not favor it. The company said its current cash reserves are sufficient to support the company's near-term growth. It did not provide a cash figure and officials at the company were not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>The company added that the credit line provides additional working capital.</p>
<p>The credit line includes, in addition to the $7.5 million, another $350,000 credit facility for equipment purchases, the company said.</p>
