<p>South Africa's Western Cape Maize Buyers Association said on Monday it will consider importing more offshore yellow maize from September.</p>
<p>"From September onwards we will again be looking at the possibility of imports of yellow maize depending on availability and prices," a spokesman for the buyers' body told Reuters.</p>
<p>This follows the association's purchase last year of around 200,000 tonnes of maize from Argentina and the United States amid concerns that South Africa could face a shortage.</p>
<p>Of this purchase some 70,000 tonnes were bought for delivery between January and March. Another four shipments of 30,000 tonnes were booked for the months of April to July.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the first shipment of this batch had already arrived and a second was expected in Cape Town harbour within the next three weeks.</p>
<p>However, the import contract gave the buyers the option not to take all loads if they chose instead to source maize locally.</p>
<p>"We are getting some from local sources instead of shipment...but one more (load) will definitely be from overseas," he said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the delay in the harvest of South Africa's new maize crop due to unseasonal rains was pushing up prices.</p>
<p>"The greatest effect is that people want more money for their maize. There is obviously a scarcity of white," he said.</p>
<p>Latest official estimates peg the country's 1997 commercial maize harvest at 7.660 million tonnes, one to two million tonnes above consumption but sharply down on last year's bumper 9.694 million tonne crop.</p>
