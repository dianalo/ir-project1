<p>A Sumitomo Corp. shareholder filed a 200 billion yen ($1.58 billion) lawsuit Tuesday against the company's former chairman over the trading house's huge copper-trading losses, a lawyer for the shareholder said.</p>
<p>Kazuyoshi Yuoka, president of Yubo Sangyo KK, an Osaka-based textile company, filed a representative shareholder's suit against Tomiichi Akiyama at the Osaka District Court, attorney Tokuo Sakaguchi said.</p>
<p>Sakaguchi said Yuoka filed the suit as an individual shareholder on behalf of shareholders seeking compensation for losses caused by the scandal. Any award would be paid to Sumitomo, and not to person who brings the suit.</p>
<p>The suit was in response to huge copper trading losses by Sumitomo's former star trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, Sakaguchi said.</p>
<p>Sumitomo has said it lost $2.6 billion as a result of a decade of unauthorised trading by Hamanaka, who was fired in June 1996.</p>
<p>Yuoka filed the suit against Akiyama because of what he believed were lax checks and controls over Hamanaka's copper trading, Sakaguchi said.</p>
<p>Akiyama was Sumitomo president when it announced its copper trading losses last June. He became chairman a few weeks later in a previously scheduled move, but resigned this post in February and was made a special adviser to the company.</p>
<p>Sakaguchi said Yuoka also filed suits against four other former Sumitomo executives for 100 million yen ($793,000) each.</p>
<p>The four are Akio Imamura, who was Hamanaka's direct supervisor; Ryo Yamakawa, Imamura's former boss; Mutsumi Hashimoto, a former Sumitomo executive vice president; and Iwao Nishiumi, a former managing director.</p>
<p>Sumitomo said in a statement: "We're not aware of the contents of the suit yet, but the company is not in a position to comment if a suit was filed against individual former executives."</p>
<p>Last September Yuoka filed a lawsuit seeking to nullify shareholder approval of a fund to cover Sumitomo's copper market losses.</p>
