<p>Yugoslav companies suffered 8.75 billion dinars ($1.54 billion) in aggregate net losses in 1996, Belgrade-based Institute for Economic Sciences (IEN) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>According to IEN's analysis, based on 1996 annual balance sheets, net loss was 2.5 billion dinars lower than in 1995.</p>
<p>IEN economist Jovan Rankovic (corrects to give source's identity) said large state-owned firms were chiefly to blame for a catastrophic situation in the Yugoslav economy reflected in general insolvency.</p>
<p>Out of 72,721 active enterprises, 4,744 are state-owned and are the biggest loss-makers, incurring a net loss of some 6.6 billion dinars ($1.17 billion).</p>
<p>"If they were eliminated the rest of the economy would be solvent," Rankovic said.</p>
<p>Some 1,049 large firms, with 932,000 workers or some 55 percent of the total number of employed, accounted for 7.355 billion dinars in net losses in 1996.</p>
<p>Rankovic said the situation was the worst for 543 public utility companies which generated 45 percent of net loss in 1996.</p>
<p>According to IEN, ten enterprises employing only 45,554 people are the biggest loss makers.</p>
<p>"Eight of them are in the power sector, one is the only oil and gas producer and one is from chemical industry sector," Rankovic said.</p>
<p>"Large socially-owned firms, relics of the old state-controlled economy, are a millstone around our neck pulling us down into an economic abyss," he said. -- Gordana Kukic, Belgrade Newsroom +38 111 222 4254</p>
