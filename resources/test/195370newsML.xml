<p>Egyptian authorities have impounded 105,000 tonnes of wheat from France on the grounds it contains stones, gravel and other foreign objects, an official source at Port Said harbour said on Sunday.</p>
<p>A first consignment of 52,500 tonnes arrived from Dunkirk on November 6 aboard the ship Wadi el-Arish and turned out to contain 1.14 percent stone and gravel, he said. It has been unloaded and stored in a warehouse pending a decision.</p>
<p>The Greek vessel Agia Dynamiz arrived from Dunkirk a few days ago with a second consignment of 52,500 tonnes and the gravel content was found to be 0.36 percent, he added.</p>
<p>The state's General Authority for Supply Commodities (GASC) had ordered the wheat and representatives of an Egyptian company had inspected it in Dunkirk, he said.</p>
<p>On Monday a Maltese-registed vessel, the Vancouver, will start unloading at Port Said 52,500 tonnes of wheat loaded at Dunkirk and at Rouen, the source added. This wheat has not been tested but it is expected to have the same problem, he said.</p>
<p>Officials of the Ministry of Supply and Trade, which runs GASC, said the ministry would probably not reject the three shipments but would opt for sieving the wheat.</p>
<p>The consignments are part of the 450,000 tonnes of French soft red GASC ordered in September. GASC said at the time that it was buying the wheat from Tradigrain, Dreyfus, Cargill, Andre, Finagrain and Sigma.</p>
