<p>Britain's new Labour government intends to overhaul the way it charges for use of the radio spectrum, officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The changes, which will affect broadcasters, mobile phone operators, taxi companies and other radio users, will raise up to one billion pounds for the government, they said.</p>
<p>The measures will be included in Wednesday's Queen's Speech outlining the Labour government's legislative programme for the next 18 months.  </p>
<p>Currently, the government raises about 40 million pounds by charging for the use of the radio spectrum. The fees do not put an economic value on the spectrum, but are simply enough to recover the government's administrative costs.</p>
<p>Under the new pricing system, operators would bid for use of the radio spectrum in those parts of the country where the airwaves were congested.</p>
<p>Officials said 80 percent of users would not be affected by the changes. But in those areas that are affected, radio-cab operators could find themselves paying an extra 50 pence a week and mobile phone users 10 pence a week, officials said.  </p>
<p>The previous Conservative government had done preliminary work on repricing the radio spectrum, but the proposal was not in Labour's election manifesto.</p>
