<p>CSCE world sugar futures settled firmer but off the highs, having failed to trigger stops resting above 11.10 cents basis May, market sources said.</p>
<p>The spot month is expected to remain close to 11.00 cents through May options expiry on Friday, since open interest in the May 11.00 calls remains high at 7,216 lots as of Monday's close.</p>
<p>Tony Passimenti of Merrill Lynch said the contract is likely to trade between 11.00 and 11.10 for the remainder of the week, and then ease closer to support by Friday.</p>
<p>"The specs will get bored, try to touch off stops and then let it fall to 11.00," he said.</p>
<p>Players have not yet begun to roll May positions aggressively into July ahead of expiry on April 30.</p>
<p>The spot month closed at 11.04, up 0.04, having ranged from 11.08 to 11.00 cents. The back months closed 0.04 firmer to 0.01 lower.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at a brisk 21,723 lots, compared with Monday's official 10,393 lots.</p>
<p>Support remained at the recent low of 10.78 cents in May, and resistance at 11.10 and then at 11.15 cents.</p>
