<headline>Monde-Lagardere patch up after libel trial.</headline>

<p>The French daily Le Monde said on Tuesday it had patched up its differences with industrialist Jean-Luc Lagardere who had sued it for libel and that all legal action between them was now ended.</p>
<p>The daily had been ordered in January to pay Lagardere 200,000 francs ($36,000) in damages for publishing erroneous information about him two months before when it wrote that he had been placed under judicial investigation for "misuse of corporate funds, fraud and forgery".</p>
<p>In fact he has been placed under investigation only for "misuse of corporate funds" in a case concerning methods of payment to executives of Lagardere Groupe, which controls missile-maker Matra and multimedia/publishing firm Hachette.</p>
<p>Le Monde, which appealed the court ruling saying its erroneous information came from a magistrate in the Paris public prosecutor's office, said on Tuesday it had now apologised to Lagardere for its mistake.</p>
<p>The daily said that a meeting between the two sides called by the magistrate handling the case resulted in Lagardere saying he would not ask for Le Monde to comply with the court ruling while the newspaper would drop its appeal against it.</p>
<p>Under French law, being placed under investigation is a first step to a possible prosecution but does not automatically lead to trial.</p>
<p>The January court decision said Le Monde failed to exercise due caution in publishing information "from insufficiently checked sources".</p>
