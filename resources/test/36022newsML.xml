<p>Italy scored another success in its battle to tame inflation on Thursday with confirmation that the annual rate fell in August to 3.4 percent, the lowest for 27 years.</p>
<p>ISTAT, the national statistics institute, said in a statement that year-on-year inflation was now at its lowest level since the summer of 1969.</p>
<p>The figure followed a 3.6 percent rise in the consumer price index in July and was the seventh successive drop. It was in line with expectations based on earlier provisional data and had no effect on financial markets.</p>
<p>Month-on-month, the index rose 0.1 percent following a 0.2 percent dip in July, the first time prices had fallen on a month-on-month basis since 1968.</p>
<p>A senior Treasury Ministry official said the figures were further evidence that government economic policy, which includes action to cut utility prices as a means of controlling inflation while also protecting salaries, was paying off.</p>
<p>"We are increasingly convinced that we have a lowering of structural inflation which is due to a series of factors. The economic slowdown throughout Europe is not one of them," the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said.</p>
<p>The centre-left government and the Bank of Italy have put the fight against inflation at the top of their agendas as they strive to put the economy in order and try to squeeze Italy in at the start of the single European currency in 1999.</p>
<p>Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said last month that he expected inflation to drop to 3.0 percent or below by the end of 1996 and that the fall should trigger a further cut in official interest rates.</p>
<p>The government has set an average annual inflation target of 2.5 percent for 1997.</p>
<p>The Bank of Italy cut its official discount rate to 8.25 percent in July after more than a year at 9.0 percent.</p>
