<p>Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap AS (Statoil) said on Friday it had restarted a compressor at the Kaarstoe gas terminal following a week-long unscheduled shutdown.</p>
<p>"The second compressor is being put into operation now," said Statoil spokesman Aadne Brathammer. "We estimate that we will be up at maximum volume at over 20 million cubic metres per day in a few hours. Right now we are at about 17 million."  </p>
<p>Gas exports were cut by almost 60 percent to about nine million cubic metres per day following the unscheduled stoppage at one of three compressor units last Friday. A second compressor was already down for maintenance.</p>
<p>Brathammer said condensate output at the Sleipner East platform, which was reduced by 20 to 25 percent during the down time, would increase in parallel with gas throughput.</p>
<p>Sleipner East normally produces around 500 tonnes per hour of condensate.</p>
<p>Oil exports from the Statfjord field were not affected by the outage due to extra gas injection capacity at the development.</p>
<p>Brathammer said Kaarstoe usually operated on two compressors, the third acting more like a "swing unit" at times of high output or depending on the quality of the gas.</p>
<p>The third compressor was due to come out of turnaround on September 20.</p>
