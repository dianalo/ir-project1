<p>Jakarta share prices closed lower on Monday, pulled down by profiting taking in several blue chips despite active buying in some secondaries, broker said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Composite Index eased 0.47 points, or 0.07 percent, to close at 696.03 points. Gainers led losers by 73 to 53, with 64 counters unchanged.</p>
<p>Total turnover was 589.4 billion rupiah on a volume of 238.17 million shares which also boosted by cross-trading transactions.</p>
<p>Telecommunications firm Telkom was cross-traded at 4,100 rupiah on a volume of 30 million shares and glass-maker Mulia Industrindo cross-trade at 2,975 rupiah on 13.5 million shares.  </p>
<p>The new LQ45 index launched on Monday was off 0.149 points, or 0.10 percent, to 147.07 points after opening at 147.218.</p>
<p>It includes stocks that are of high market liquidity and value and the 45 companies included in the index represent about 80 percent of total market capitalisation on the Jakarta bourse.</p>
<p>The exchange said the index had been calculated from a base of 100 on July 13, 1994.</p>
<p>Brokers said the market focus on Tuesday would likely remain on second-liners with active locally-driven buying.  </p>
<p>"Market speculations that some companies have been targeted for either take-overs or a link-up is likely to continue boosting sentiment in certain issues," a broker said.</p>
<p>She referred to Hero supermarket, retailer Multipolar and shoe maker Ganda Wangsa.</p>
<p>Brokers said supermarket Hero was also active on intense speculation that the firm had been targeted by the Lippo Group for a possible take-over or link-up despite denials from executives of both companies.</p>
<p>Hero rose 100 rupiah to 2,575 rupiah on 5.2 million shares.</p>
<p>The news also boosted sentiment toward retailer Multipolar, a unit of the Lippo Group, which rose 125 rupiah to close at 2,475 rupiah on 5.9 million shares traded, brokers said.  </p>
<p>They said the rise in Multipolar was also linked to recent news that Matahari founder Hari Darmawan was planning to take a stake in the firm after Multipolar took a 50.1 controlling interest in Matahari.</p>
<p>Shoe maker Ganda Wangsa Utama was the most active stock with 19.2 million shares changing hand, rising 100 rupiah to close at 1,225 rupiah amid speculation over the agenda for a shareholders' meeting due on March 24.</p>
<p>One broker said there was market speculation the company might get new investors coupled with talks of a possible rights issue, stock split and bonus shares.</p>
<p>Company officials were not available for comment.  </p>
<p>Brokers said continued profit-taking in blue chips such as Indosat and Sampoerna on Tuesday would put a cap on the index.</p>
<p>Telecommunications service provider Indosat fell 1.06 percent to close at 6,975 rupiah on 522,500 shares in line with its Friday closing price in New York of $29.</p>
<p>Cigarette maker Sampoerna fell 150 rupiah to 14,000 rupiah on a volume of 317,000 shares on what brokers said was profit-taking.</p>
