<p>Hong Kong's Financial Secretary said on Tuesday the territory can cope with the kind of currency speculation that has recently battered the Thai baht.</p>
<p>"There is a genuine fear that volatility which started in Thailand is likely to spread and might come our way and we might have to spend lots of time and energy shooting all the speculative sharks," Donald Tsang said.</p>
<p>"For that reason, I think it would be in our interest ultimately that we help," he told Hong Kong government radio.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is contributing US$1 billion to a US$16 billion rescue package for Thailand organised by the International Monetary Fund, which next month will be holding its annual joint meeting with the World Bank in Hong Kong for the first time.</p>
<p>Tsang added: "I have no fear at all that Hong Kong will have any difficulty in facing any speculative activities of this kind," he said, noting the local currency is strong.</p>
<p>"We know that we are an extremely strong economy with robust fundamentals. We have total reserves of exceeding US$80 billion and we do not have any fiscal borrowing. And that is one of the strongest... monetary positions any territory can look for. So I have no immediate fear at all," he said.</p>
<p>The Thai baht has been hit by speculative selling pressure in recent months, which forced Thailand to undertake a de facto devaluation of its currency in July.</p>
<p>Tsang said Hong Kong's share of the rescue package will come from the exchange fund, reserves held to back the local dollar.</p>
<p>He said Hong Kong decided to help as it realised Thailand sufferred from a shortage of foreign exchange resserves and its currency lacked the strength to withstand speculative attacks.</p>
<p>"There is a genuine concern that there will be a what the international bankers call contagion effect spreading in the region. So I thought that was an opportunity that we have to react to. We could not sit on our hands," he said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong on Tuesday voiced support for the move.</p>
<p>"With a US$1 billion contribution Hong Kong has once again demonstrated the strength of its economic clout in the region," the influential South China Morning Post said in an editorial.</p>
<p>"Hong Kong's role as a reoingal financial hub gives it a strong interest in promoting economic stability throughout the region," it said.</p>
<p>Tsang said he thought China, which was represented at a bankers' meeting on the rescue package called by the IMF in Tokyo, would also be prepared to join in the rescue later.</p>
<p>"The mainland was equally concerned. Beijing was represented at the meeting in Tokyo yesterday and they were reacting very positively to it," Tsang said.</p>
<p>"But they have other technical questions to go through. And I think they will be prepared to help later on," he said.</p>
<p>China resumed sovereignty over Hong Kong at midnight on June 30, ending 156 years of British colonial rule.</p>
<p>"Every international banker, and particularly central bankers, realises that we are living in a global village where a problem happening in one area is likely to affect another area," he said. "So I think Beijing is conscious of the problem facing us collectively." he said.</p>
