<p>The Katz commission on South Africa's tax system planned wide consultations over the next few months before making recommendations, commissioner Jan Graaf said on Monday.</p>
<p>He told the parliamentary finance committee that the commission could not recommend any way forward without the broad support of the whole population.</p>
<p>"The matter raises all sorts of very delicate political sensitivities," he said.</p>
<p>The easiest and cheapest way to raise state revenue was to use indirect taxes such as value added tax.</p>
<p>"But there is a very strong lobby that says that we must not rely too much on taxes like VAT before networks are in place which enable quick and easy poverty relief to be given to people who those taxes are going to hurt," Graaf said.</p>
<p>The commission had completed work on capital transfer taxes, but was still working on proposals which would affect land, mining, benefit funds and non-governmental organisations. It expected to complete its work by November.</p>
