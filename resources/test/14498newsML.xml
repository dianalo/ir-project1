<p>For the last time, Hong Kong's British garrison on Monday marked the liberation of the colony from Japanese rule after World War Two in a ceremony remembering the many who fought and died during the brutal occupation.</p>
<p>Under the eyes of local veterans, some 50 men from the 1st Battalion the Royal Gurkha Rifles paraded past the Cenotaph in Hong Kong island's Central district memorializing the dead, marching to the Band of the Corps of the Royal Engineers.</p>
<p>Following a two minute silence, Commander British Forces Major General Bryan Dutton laid a wreath at the foot of the memorial, followed by representatives of veterans, former prisoners of war and service organizations.</p>
<p>This time next year, the British garrison and the crown colony of Hong Kong will already have been consigned to history, as the territory lowers the Union Jack at midnight, June 30, 1997, and becomes a Special Administrative Region of China.</p>
<p>Liberation Day itself will no longer be marked on the last Monday of August as it has been since the war.</p>
<p>Rather, the Chinese committee preparing for the transfer of sovereignty has decreed that Sino-Japan War Victory Day will be observed on the third Monday of the month.</p>
<p>How the future People's Liberation Army (PLA) garrison in Hong Kong may wish to mark the day is not known.</p>
<p>"This should continue after 1997," said one Hong Kong Chinese veteran at the ceremony. "The dead, they died for Hong Kong, for China."</p>
<p>Some veterans have vowed to continue remembrances for their fallen comrades even if they have to move to a private venue, but have voiced their faith that China would give its blessing.</p>
<p>The arrival of the PLA in Hong Kong on July 1 next year is viewed with some trepidation in the territory, a British colony for more than a century and a half.</p>
<p>Images of the PLA's 1989 crackdown on student democracy protestors around Tiananmen Square remains etched in Hong Kong's collective memory.</p>
<p>The PLA has been working hard to burnish its image. In a campaign to win the territory's hearts and minds, it has emphasised the high professionalism and character of the soldiers who will be stationed here.</p>
<p>China and Britain agreed last week to talks in September to hammer out laws governing the future Chinese garrison.</p>
<p>The Japanese invaded Hong Kong from China, crossing the border on December 8, 1941, at about the same time as the attack on Pearl Harbour on the other side of the date line.</p>
<p>The colony held out for more than two weeks despite overwhelming odds, defended by a tiny, lightly armed garrison aided by volunteers. It fell 17 days later on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Thousands of British and Commonwealth prisoners of war were interned in camps on Hong Kong. Others were transported to Japan and Taiwan to become virtual slave labourers.</p>
<p>Chinese residents suffered harsh rule, economic collapse and shortages of food and resources. The population fell from 1.6 million before the invasion to just 600,000 at liberation.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's liberation officially falls on August 30, when the British Navy under Rear-Admiral Cecil Harcourt sailed into Victoria Harbour to accept the Japanese surrender.</p>
<p>But the Union Jack was raised nearly two weeks earlier, just days after Tokyo's capitulation, when the internees left the camps and set up a provisional government.</p>
