<p>Shares in ferry operator Holyman Ltd defied a broader market selloff on Monday to head higher, jumping over 10 percent to A$1.78 by noon as traders spotted a bargain after last week's profit downgrade-inspired dumping.</p>
<p>On August 13, Holyman said it had reduced its year net profit forecast to the range of A$11.5 million to A$13.5 million from a A$14 million to A$16 million range predicted on June 6.</p>
<p>From A$3.10 prior to the downgrade announcement, the shipping operator's shares sank 49 percent to a record low of A$1.578 in early trade this morning before finding support.  </p>
<p>"That (downgrade) really came out of the forest. What they had said earlier didn't prepare the market for it," said broker Kevin Lourey of Peake Lands Kirwan, noting last week's savage reaction. Others agreed, adding that the stock had been rerated at its lower levels. "It was overdone last week, now people are starting to see some value there," said a Sydney broker.</p>
<p>Holyman cited a performance below expectations from its 67 percent owned U.K. division Holyman Sally as the reason for the downgrade. It said half year profit to June 30 would be materially affected by Holyman Sally's results in that period.  </p>
<p>The remainder of Holyman Sally is owned by Silja Oy Ab of Finland.</p>
<p>However, Holyman noted that excluding Holyman Sally, other units were performing in line with existing forecasts.</p>
<p>Holyman shares listed in April 1994 and reached a peak of A$6.00 in November 1996 before tumbling over 70 percent to today's early record lows.</p>
<p>By 12.45 p.m. (0045 GMT), Holyman shares were 19 cents higher at A$1.79 on turnover of 1.06 million shares.</p>
