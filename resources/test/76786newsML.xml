<p>France's Socialist CFDT union said on Wednesday that it had called a one-day strike at the Caisses d'Epargne savings bank group to protest against any attempt by the Caisses to buy the CIC bank, which is being privatised.</p>
<p>The union said it would propose the 24-hour strike at an inter-union meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>If the proposal wins approval, the strike would be in early October, before the Caisses d'Epargne supervisory board meets to decide whether it would make a bid for CIC, which belongs to state-controlled insurer GAN, said Jean-Paul Halgand, CFDT representative at the Caisses d'Epargne.</p>
<p>"It would be for early October. We all agree on the need for action," Halgand said.</p>
<p>A CFDT statement said the central supervisory board of the Caisses grouping had postponed to October 7 from September 18 a decision on what stance to take on the CIC sale.</p>
<p>It alleged this had been done to try to muster a majority in favour of a deal and that a majority would not have materialised on September 18.</p>
<p>"We must fight this takeover," said the statement. Halgand repeated union fears of 5,000 job losses if a takeover went ahead.</p>
<p>The CFDT statement said other suitors including commerical banks Societe Generale and BNP did not want to pay too much for the group and that the Caisses should remain a group whose primary mandate was to serve the public interest rather than become a bank like the others.</p>
<p>The government launched a tender on August 5 for the sale of 67 percent of CIC and closing date for offers is October 7.</p>
