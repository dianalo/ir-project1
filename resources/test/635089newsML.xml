<p>France's new Socialist leaders are turning up the pressure on carmaker Renault to consider alternatives to its decision to close a Belgian plant.</p>
<p>"It seems what is needed, and it's what the factory's staff are seeking, is the opening of negotiations and discussions, which hasn't been done," Elisabeth Guigou, tipped to become the European Affairs minister in a new Socialist government, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Her comments to RTL radio came as Renault met its European works council to discuss the closure of the Vilvoorde plant which sparked an outcry when it was announced in February.</p>
<p>Renault called the meeting after French and Belgian courts ruled that it could not close the plant, which now employs about 3,000 people, until it convened the European works council.</p>
<p>The carmaker's unions, emboldened by the French Socialists' victory, have asked for an independent expert's opinion in a move that could delay the shutdown planned for this year.</p>
<p>Renault managers reiterated at the meeting that the closure was essential not only to reduce costs but also to streamline the company's money-losing car assembly operations in Europe.</p>
<p>They expect the government to agree that tough measures are needed to save Renault, which lost 5.25 billion francs ($901.2 million) last year.</p>
<p>The company's position was bolstered by dismal May sales figures announced on Monday. Car sales in France fell 23 percent last month and are down 22.6 percent on the year.</p>
<p>The unions hope their proposals, which were given short shrift by France's reform-minded conservatives, will get a more sympathetic hearing from a new Socialist-led government which campaigned on saving and creating jobs.</p>
<p>"The European works council is asking that the board meeting of Renault, at which the state representatives' mandate will be renewed, and the annual general meeting on June 10 stop the closure," the European works council said in a statement.</p>
<p>Five of Renault's 15 board members represent the state's 46 percent stake. The staff have three representatives, and union leaders hope to line up a majority opposed to the closure.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said last week before the runoff election vote that his party would ask Renault to look for ways to keep the plant open. A spokesman for the new government said on Monday it would discuss the planned closure with Renault.</p>
<p>"We saw a brutal decision come down and, in our opinion, all the possibilities had not been explored," Guigou said.</p>
<p>The unions propose to save the plant by reducing work-weeks.</p>
<p>"We want the government to use Renault as a showcase on how to save jobs by reducing work-weeks," said Emmanuel Couvreur of the Socialist-led CFDT union.</p>
<p>He said the union had presented a plan to shorten work-weeks that would not raise production costs over a five-year period.</p>
<p>But Renault says shorter work-weeks are not a solution.</p>
<p>Michel de Virville, secretary general in charge of staff and legal affairs, said reducing work-weeks under the Robien law which provides lower charges for companies preserving jobs by cutting hours, would not save as much money as the closure. The company estimates the shutdown would save 850 million francs.</p>
<p>More important, de Virville said, shorter work-weeks would not achieve Renault's goal to bring its production activities in line with those of its competitors in Europe.</p>
<p>It produces 125,000 cars on average per plant, compared with over 200,000 at Ford, Opel and Volkswagen .</p>
<p>De Virville said the closure would also cut logistical and equipment costs at Renault, which produces many of its small models in several plants. The Clio, for instance, is built at five sites, including Vilvoorde.</p>
<p>Renault, whose performance has been hammered by a fierce price war, estimates its share of the overcapacity plaguing the European market at around 200,000 cars a day -- roughly the equivalent of one plant's production.</p>
<p>It also plans to eliminate nearly 2,800 jobs in France this year and similar numbers in coming years.</p>
<p>On Monday, Automobiles Peugeot , the leading car division at PSA Peugeot Citroen, said it would shed 2,816 jobs. ($ = 5.825 French Francs)</p>
