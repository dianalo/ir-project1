<p>About 3,000 slum dwellers marched to the Presidential Palace on Tuesday to denounce the demolition of their shanties as part of a government campaign to impress APEC leaders meeting in the Philippines in November.</p>
<p>Carrying signs reading "APEC equals demolition," the protesters said government wrecking crews had destroyed 3,000 shanties around Manila since June and 13,000 more were to go before the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum summit.</p>
<p>The protesters included street vendors, dockhands, washerwomen and housewives.</p>
<p>"They are rushing the demolition of houses in areas where the APEC delegates will pass. Our government does not want APEC to see the squatters," rally organiser Belen Abagao told reporters.</p>
<p>Leaders of 18 economies are to arrive in Manila on November 24 and hold their fourth summit at the Subic Bay freeport north of the Philippine capital.</p>
<p>The summit will be preceded by a ministerial conference in Manila.</p>
<p>Officials deny that the demolitions are part of a campaign to beautify Manila for the benefit of APEC delegates, and say moving squatters to resettlement areas is part of a programme to develop urban centres and their economies.</p>
<p>But the protesters accused the government of pursuing development at the expense of the poor.</p>
<p>"They are told that they must go because the developers want the land on which they reside or because the government says they are 'eyesores" for the sights of foreign investors and tourists," they said in a statement.</p>
