<p>A committee monitoring a ceasefire understanding between Lebanon and Israel will meet on Sunday to look into a Lebanese complaint over Israeli shelling of civilian areas, Lebanese official sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said representatives of the five nations making up the committee -- Lebanon, Israel, Syria, France and the United States -- will meet at 0700 gmt in Naqoura, the coastal headquarters of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).</p>
<p>"The committee will meet following a complaint by Lebanon over Israeli shelling of civilian areas on September 19 which is in breach of the April understanding," a foreign ministry official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Israeli jets and gunners bombarded villages held by the pro-Iranian Hizbollah in south Lebanon on Thursday after two Israeli soldiers were killed and eight wounded inside Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone.</p>
<p>At least 50 shells slammed inside the villages of Ain Bouswar and Jba'a, wounding a Lebanese civilian woman in Jba'a who was hurt by flying debris.</p>
<p>An April understanding -- which brought to an end 17 days of an Israeli blitz on Lebanon -- banned firing from or at civilian targets on the two sides of the border but did not rule out guerrilla attacks on Israeli troops inside the zone.</p>
<p>Hizbollah is fighting to oust Israel from the 15-km (nine mile)-deep border zone.</p>
