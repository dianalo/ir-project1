<p>The Egyptian state sold more than 1.35 million shares in Nile Cotton Ginning to strategic investors on Thursday at between 42.50 and 50.00 pounds a share.</p>
<p>The state's Holding Company for Cotton and International Trading had offered at least 1.2 million shares, 20 percent of the company, at a minimum price of 42.00 pounds.</p>
<p>Data from the Egyptian stock exchange showed that in the first hour of trading on Thursday, 1.37 million shares were sold in 38 transactions for 61.11 million pounds ($18 million).</p>
<p>The holding company and the agents for the sale were not available to say if the state planned to sell more.</p>
<p>Nile Cotton Ginning almost doubled net after-tax profits for the 1995/6 financial year to 14.089 million pounds ($4.14 million) from 7.187 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>The average sale price of about 44.60 pounds a share gives a P/E ratio of about 19, higher than average for the Cairo market.</p>
