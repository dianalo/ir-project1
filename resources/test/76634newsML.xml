<p>Shares ended modest Wednesday trade higher as U.S. rate jitters eased, and early gains in technology sector on Wall Street lifted Nokia, brokers said.</p>
<p>The HEX index rose 0.85 percent to 2,147.36 with volume a light 252 million markka, about one-third of it in Nokia which ended up 3.00 markka at 199.00.</p>
<p>The market was expected to continue recovering on Thursday after a soft start to the week, they said.</p>
<p>"The tone is slightly better now as U.S. rate fears eased," one broker said.</p>
<p>Metal stocks gained, probably because investors continued to underweight forestries after Metsa-Serla's profit-warning on Tuesday, brokers said.</p>
<p>Metsa-Serla's B share closed fair trade 0.20 markka down at 30.80. UPM-Kymmene ended active trade flat at 96.00 markka.</p>
<p>Cranes maker Konecranes lost 2.10 markka at 123.00 in moderate trade ahead of its January-August results due on Thursday at 1000/0700 GMT.</p>
<p>Beverages group Hartwall also ended lower at 123.00 markka, down 1.00, in lively trade ahead of eight-month data due on Thursday at about 1600/1300 GMT. Earlier in the session it hit a calendar-year high of 127.00.</p>
