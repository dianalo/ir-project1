<p>Egypt has grown 5.9 million tonnes of wheat in the 1997 season, state television on Monday quoted Supply and Trade Minister Ahmed Gueily as saying.</p>
<p>It said Egypt had planted higher yielding varieties which helped boost production but did not give any more details.</p>
<p>The figure is less than the seven million tonnes which Agriculture Minister Youssef Wali was quoted late last year as saying that Egypt hoped to harvest.</p>
<p>In the previous season, which ended in the early summer of 1996, the country grew 5.7 million tonnes of wheat, slightly less than it initially hoped.</p>
<p>Despite dramatic increases in wheat production in the 1990s, Egypt is still one of the world's biggest wheat importers, buying more than four million tonnes a year, mainly from the United States, Europe and Australia. --Cairo newsroom +202 578 3290/1</p>
