<p>Airlines and freight forwarders in Hong Kong are reporting better than expected demand for trans Pacific cargo flights during April when the market traditionally takes a post-Easter dip.</p>
<p>Rates, which were also expected to retreat from their Easter peak season highs, are also reported to be holding firm as airlines appear determined to maintain yields they have struggled to restore after last year's lows.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's de facto flag carrier, Cathay Pacific, which is a major trans-Pacific cargo carrier with 747 freighter flights to Los Angeles, New York, Toronto and Vancouver, reported good business.</p>
<p>"In general the market is performing quite well, not quite as strong as the first couple of months of the year but our loads are good right now to both east and west U.S.," said Ray Jewell, Cathay Pacific Cargo's marketing and sales manager.</p>
<p>Cathay is also expecting another period of increased activity before the upcoming Golden Week holiday in Japan which may also spur trans-Pacific services.</p>
<p>"Yields are holding relatively firm. We are happy with that situation as well and hope to maintain it during the seasonal slackening period which is coming up," Jewell added.</p>
<p>A growing force in the air freight market between the U.S. and Asia, Polar Air Cargo, which further expanded its Asian network by starting freighter operations to Osaka and Seoul on April 15, was bullish describing the ex-Hong Kong market as "very strong."</p>
<p>A Polar spokesman said rates have remained "very firm with no hint of a drop."</p>
<p>Polar's sales team said they had been told that the buying index which measures the level of goods already bought by purchasers in Hong Kong and China in the coming months is up and confidently expects continuing strong demand for air cargo space.</p>
<p>Against expectations by freight forwarders, trans-Pacific rates are holding very firm. Cargo rates across major Asian airports are also reported to be firm.</p>
<p>"After a difficult time last year when rates hit an all time low I think the carriers are looking to hold firm with the rates," one source said.</p>
<p>"At the moment there is no indication of rates falling at all," Mark Wilson of Benair Freight (HK) Ltd said.</p>
<p>"It was thought that after Easter rates would start to drop. For instance, to the US west coast we were paying around HK$16-16.50 normally that would drop to as low as HK$14 but in fact they have been holding firm, loading has been holding good for the airlines and they seem to have good traffic yields. They are trying hard to keep those prices high and over the next two to three months which is the traditional quiet season it will be interesting to see how rates fare,' he added.</p>
<p>Another source from one of the largest air freight forwarders in Hong Kong said rates had been stopped from dropping because demand for space had continued to be relatively high.</p>
<p>Freight forwarders also reported a continuing trend of rising flows of trans-Pacific in-bound cargo from the U.S.. Unlike a few years ago where there was a big trade imbalance, airlines are flying increasing amounts of ex-US cargo into Hong Kong. Freight forwarders said this two way traffic helps to maintain strong rates.</p>
<p>"Demand for space coming into Hong Kong is now much more critical. Imports from the States have been steadily climbing which means we almost have a 50/50 situation which is good for the airlines which benefit from the two way traffic. However, rates compared to recent years are considered to be quite low but inbound demand more than doubling has helped airlines offset costs," the source said.</p>
<p>Freight forwarders generally reported a surprisingly good first quarter and a definite improvement on last year.</p>
<p>U.S.-based Burlingtons Air Express PZS.N also reported noticeably larger amounts of imports from the U.S. than exports. A company source also reported "very strong" Hong Kong exports during March which he said was the best month in the past year apart from October/November and the traditional rush leading up to Christmas.</p>
<p>A company source attributed Hong Kong's recently strong export demand to the quarter end for U.S. electronics companies demanding Asian produced goods.</p>
<p>Northwest Airlines, which said it is the largest U.S. trans-Pacific carrier, was more negative and reported a "definite downturn" in the Hong Kong market this week which was being reflected in other Asian cities.</p>
<p>"We have been pretty busy up to this week when demand has fallen off significantly," reported Northwest Cargo's sales and marketing manager, Alexander Wong.</p>
<p>Northwest has six freighter flights weekly in addition to daily belly cargo space to its Tokyo hub and three times a week passenger flight from Hong Kong to Seattle.</p>
<p>The U.S.-bound market traditionally dips in April and May but various company spokesman had different opinions on how low demand would get.</p>
<p>Thomas Mui, general manager for Jardine Freight Services, part of the aviation and shipping division of Jardine Pacific Limited said the market had fallen since the Easter peak but the first quarter had been very satisfying.</p>
<p>"March was extremely good which made up for a quieter February and that strength was maintained into the first week of April but now it has fallen off. Next month we expect to be even worse but hopefully by July it will have picked up again," Mui said.</p>
<p>Mui said rates have fallen around 15 U.S. cents per pound since the Easter peak season and now stand at around US$1.10 per pound to both U.S. east and west coast entry points.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong to Japan route has recently seen big increases in capacity from Hong Kong airlines which have said the Japanese market is their most profitable.</p>
<p>A Japan Airlines spokesman said rates had stayed firm and that the market was "very very competitive."</p>
<p>Rivals Cathay Pacific recently began four new afternoon flights to Osaka Kansai. Cathay's all cargo subsidiary, AHK Air Hong Kong Ltd, also began a third weekly freighter service to Kansai earlier this month.</p>
<p>JAL, which has released a long term business plan to increase cargo capacity by wet leasing from contractors along with joint operations with other carriers, reported much stronger trans-Pacific traffic levels than from Hong Kong to JAL's Tokyo Narita hub.</p>
<p>A JAL spokesman in Hong Kong reported backlogs at Narita due to space limitations. JAL also said it was experiencing heavy competition from U.S. trans-Pacific carriers.</p>
<p>The Alaskan hub of Anchorage is the top US airport for Hong Kong imports, according to latest statistics for February from the territory's Civil Aviation Department. New York's Kennedy airport was the leadnng trans-Pacific entry point for Hong Kong exports.</p>
<p>Freight forwarders were generally optimistic about business prospects in the lead-up to the territory's event of the year, the handover to Chinese sovereignity.</p>
<p>Cathay agreed that trade levels leading up to the handover look promising.</p>
<p>"I have not spoken to anyone who is not relatively optimistic about this year," Jewell added. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 7706 Fax +5017</p>
