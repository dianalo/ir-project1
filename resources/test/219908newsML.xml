<p>Mexican ex-president Carlos Salinas de Gortari, who lives in self-imposed exile in Ireland, was questioned on Wednesday by prosecutors investigating the 1994 killing of a top Mexican politician, the government said.</p>
<p>"Carlos Salinas de Gortari answered an extensive list of questions and handed over a document which will be added to the corresponding investigation," the Mexican Foreign Ministry and Attorney General's Office said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>Salinas, who left Mexico in disgrace in March 1995 following the arrest of his elder brother on murder charges in a separate case, gave evidence at the Mexican Embassy in Dublin, the statement said.</p>
<p>The special prosecutor in charge of probing the March 23, 1994 assassination of ruling party presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio was in charge of the questioning of Salinas.</p>
<p>Colosio was the hand-picked choice of Salinas to run for president for the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).</p>
<p>His death catapulted his campaign manager Ernesto Zedillo into the PRI candidacy and Zedillo easily won August 1994 presidential elections. No PRI candidate has lost a presidential race since the party's formation in 1929.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians, many convinced that Salinas was involved in the killing, had demanded that the former president be brought back to Mexico to testify in the case.</p>
<p>Salinas has denied any involvement in the assassination and even went on a brief hunger strike in March last year to demand that authorities make clear he was not a suspect.</p>
<p>Officials have said Salinas was likely to be questioned as a witness to events surrounding the death rather than as a suspect.</p>
<p>Colosio was shot dead at the end of campaign rally in the northern city of Tijuana. One man is serving a 45-year sentence for the killing but prosecutors believe his death was the result of a conspiracy involving other people.</p>
