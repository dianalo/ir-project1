<p>Japanese financial markets made a gloomy start to the new year on Monday as the yen slipped to its lowest level against the dollar in almost four years, dragging stocks and bonds down with it.</p>
<p>While stocks recovered by the close, government bonds were stuck with big losses by midday, hit hard by the weak yen and market jitters over a possible rise in interest rates.</p>
<p>A lack of confidence in Japan's economic strength kept market participants edgy, fanning concern over "triple weakness" in Japanese financial markets in which the yen is sold as capital flows out of Japanese stocks and bonds.</p>
<p>The yen fell to 117.00 yen to the dollar -- its lowest level since March 29, 1993 -- in early trading but bounced back to around 116.70 yen by midday on caution over possible intervention by Japanese monetary authorities. The yen ended at around 116.33 to the dollar in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>"The dollar is unexpectedly strong," said Tatsuo Ogawa, deputy general manager of the trading division at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. "We don't see any big change in the pattern of selling Japan (assets) and buying the U.S. (assets)."</p>
<p>A trader at a major Japanese securities house said the stock market was discouraged at the open by the yen's easing against the dollar during the New Year holidays in Tokyo. The dollar stood at around 115.97 yen in Tokyo on December 30, the last trading day of 1996.</p>
<p>The key Nikkei average fell by as much as 150 points on Monday morning before bouncing back to end a shortened trading session at 19,446.00, up 84.65 points or 0.44 percent.</p>
<p>The trader said that since the stock market's fall in the morning had been more modest than expected, people started to buy on dips.</p>
<p>"While the market overall has been anxious about the future of the economy, the trend of selective buying (in blue-chip issues) intensified," said Tadahiro Kamogawa, a senior analyst at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Blue-chip issues such as Toyota Motor, which benefits from a weaker yen as this makes its exports cheaper, climbed to a record high of 3,350 yen.</p>
<p>The Japanese stock market has been dragged down by worries about the state of the Japanese economy and a lack of solid government proposals to shore up the economic recovery.</p>
<p>Dealers say the dollar may climb to 118 yen soon as money flows into U.S. financial assets, drawn by relatively high interest rates. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 101.60 points to close at 6,544.09 on Friday, in one of its biggest point gains ever.</p>
<p>Despite the mild recovery by Japanese stocks on Monday, the market is still bearish as the weaker yen has fuelled worries that foreign investors may dump yen-denominated assets as their value in dollar terms sinks.</p>
<p>Japanese government bonds (JGBs) were hit hard on Monday. The March JGB futures stood at 123.73 by Tokyo midday, down from the December 30 close of 124.20. The benchmark 182nd cash JGB yield stood at 2.625 percent, up from 2.575 percent.</p>
<p>Media reports that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may raise interest rates from their record low levels before April also weighed on bond prices.</p>
<p>"The talk had a negative impact on JGBs initially...But it is hard to believe that the BOJ will raise interest rates soon," a trader for a brokerage house said.</p>
<p>Japan has kept the key discount rate -- the interest rate the central bank charges on overnight loans to commercial banks -- at a historic low of 0.5 percent since September 1995.</p>
