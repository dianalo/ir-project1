<p>Lack of cash threatens to sideline war-ravaged Liberia and world footballer of the year George Weah from the 1998 African Nations' Cup.</p>
<p>An attempt to organise a flight for the home-based players to Zaire for Sunday's group six qualifier failed late on Friday, the players said.</p>
<p>The players said they were hoping for a successful 11th hour compromise deal between the government and a private airline on Saturday.</p>
<p>Weah, the AC Milan player who paid $40,000 out of his own pocket to fund the last two qualifiers against Gambia, was in Abidjan and not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Soccer is one of the few things that unite Liberia where almost seven years of civil war has killed well over 150,000 people.</p>
<p>Players and fans picketed the finance ministry in Monrovia last week, demanding that the government release funds. In the event, the government lacked enough ready cash.</p>
