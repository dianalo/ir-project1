<p>Germany coach Berti Vogts on Sunday slammed clubs for paying big salaries to average players, although he defended the pay packages of major figures such as Stefan Effenberg and Thomas Haessler.</p>
<p>Vogts, preparing for Germany's World Cup qualifier with Albania on Wednesday, also said too many senior club players were not doing enough to help their younger team mates.</p>
<p>Players such as Effenberg at Borussia Moenchengladbach and Karlsruhe's Haessler had helped revive their clubs' fortunes by coming back to Germany after lucrative spells in Italy, he said.</p>
<p>"These players earn their millions quite rightly. The problem in Germany is that average players earn too much," Vogts told the Welt am Sonntag weekly newspaper.</p>
<p>He recalled his own playing days at Moenchengladbach, when senior players such as Guenter Netzer helped the coach make important decisions and helped the side's newcomers.</p>
<p>"That's lacking today," Vogts said. "Too many professionals turn up for training five minutes before it starts and they're gone five minutes after they've finished showering."</p>
