<p>U.S. municipal bond prices ended 1/8 to 1/4 point lower but avoided U.S. Treasuries' deeper slide Tuesday, while new deals appeared to garner good demand.</p>
<p>"One of the Fed Governors, (Janet) Yellen, came out and talked about inflation in the air. Treasuries traded down, munis traded down," a trader said.</p>
<p>Though the trader judged muni cash down 1/4 point, bonds remain scarce, he said.  </p>
<p>"I think it's really a supply trade right here. I just don't think there's a lot of munis to knock us down with, so whatever is around sort of gets taken up," the trader said.</p>
<p>A municipal analyst said high-grade issues exited the session slightly easier, while dollar bonds lost 1/4 point. Activity was moderate, he said.</p>
<p>In debt futures, the December municipal contract closed down 10/32 at 111-21/32. The December T-bond contract closed down 18/32 at 106-21/32. The MOB spread was 160 ticks. In the government market, the benchmark 30-year bond was down 15/32 at 95-17/32 to yield 7.11 percent.  </p>
<p>New issue pricing was "firm" on both negotiated and competitive offerings, the analyst said. A trader said while "there is some calendar this week," deals appear to be going "reasonably well."</p>
<p>Tuesday's biggest new issue was a $389.3 million, Washington Public Power Supply System offering. Goldman Sachs &amp; Co repriced the offering, lowering yields in several maturities and cutting the top yield in 2012 to 5.91 percent from 5.95 percent.</p>
<p>A trader said the offering appeared to go well.  </p>
<p>"We had good orders for the deal, and they were able to reprice some (maturities)," he said. "It seems like all the other transactions are going well. I think there's still good demand for municipals, or so it seems."</p>
<p>Several competitive issues also priced Tuesday. Lehman Brothers won $100 million Mayfield, Ky., variable rate multi-city lease revenue refunding bonds. The offering, which was not formally reoffered to investors, consisted of a single 2026 maturity with a 3.5 percent coupon.  </p>
<p>Lehman also won $97.9 million Clark County, Nev., general obligation bonds at a true interest cost of 5.832 percent. It also won an $83 million Pinellas County, Fla., offering at a true interest cost of 5.389 percent.</p>
<p>In the short-term market, Fleet Securities Inc won $85 million of Suffolk County, N.Y.'s $95 million of tax anticipation notes, according to market sources. Oppenheimer &amp; Co won the remaining $10 million. Fleet's net interest cost was 3.9905 percent, while Oppenheimer's was a 3.9868 percent.</p>
<p>Turning to Wednesday, 14 negotiated sales totaling $513 million are scheduled. A $134 million Broward County, Fla., deal via PaineWebber Inc tops the list.</p>
<p>In competitive action, 15 deals are scheduled totaling $467 million. A $115 million Wisconsin offering leads Wednesday's list.</p>
