<p>ICI Plc chief economist Richard Freeman said on Thursday that the output of the west European chemicals industry was expected to rise by around 3.3 percent overall this year, after what he called "disappointing growth of one percent last year".</p>
<p>In a speech to the business outlook conference of Britain's Chemical Industry Association (CIA), Freeman said both the general European economy and the chemical industry "have recovered reasonably well since the middle of 1996 and are continuing to strengthen".</p>
<p>Freeman, who is also chairman of the CIA's economic appraisal committee, said growth in 1997 would be driven by an acceleration in GDP expansion, a positive contribution from chemical stocks and continued growth in net exports.</p>
<p>Freeman said exports from western Europe were expected to rise by around four percent this year compared with 3.5 percent growth in 1996 "with trade to eastern Europe and Asia particularly buoyant".</p>
<p>He said that the largest recovery in output would be in Germany and added that UK chemical output was expected to rise by 2.9 percent.</p>
