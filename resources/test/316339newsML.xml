<p>Malaysia's tin price ended down 27 cents at 14.59 ringgit ($5.88) a kg, pressured by large offerings on the back of a sharp fall on the London Metal Exchange (LME) overnight, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders also attributed the drop to a technical adjustment after a 45-cent jump on Thursday.</p>
<p>"After the sharp fall in London and big jump here yesterday, we had expected some reaction," said one trader.</p>
<p>He said he expected the wide fluctuations to continue given the volatility of the copper market.  </p>
<p>There were initial offers for 146 tonnes against bids for 49 tonnes. Final turnover was 115 tonnes, down from 160 on Thursday, and buyers were from Europe, Japan and Malaysia.</p>
<p>The premium over the LME narrowed to $55 a tonne against $90 previously, traders said.</p>
