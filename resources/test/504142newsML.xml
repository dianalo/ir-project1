<p>North Korean pilots are flying more missions than in the past two or three years, showing that economic collapse has not hurt the country's war capability, the chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff General John Shalikashvili said on Friday.</p>
<p>Shalikashvili also cautioned against too much optimism about signs the communist nation was getting close to joining a possible peace dialogue that could end tension on the divided Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>He told reporters in Tokyo that U.S. military forces in the region must not to let their guard down because recent exercises had improved the proficiency of the North Korean military.</p>
<p>Asked if widespread famine and other economic woes had decreased North Korea's military capability, Shalikashvili said a just-concluded winter training exercise showed Pyongyang was still a serious threat.</p>
<p>"They apparently have enough fuel to have conducted a fairly robust training cycle that involved road marches and movement of units. Pilots have been flying at a greater rate than the last two years or three years," he said.</p>
<p>"To the degree that they've been doing it, they've increased their proficiency this winter training cycle. We need to stay ready and watchful."</p>
<p>Shalikashvili questioned how North Korea could have carried out its recent extensive exercises if the country was in economic collapse.</p>
<p>"If they are in such great difficulty as they claim they are and if they are in need of assistance, why are they spending their resources on this kind of military exercising, you have to ask yourself," he said.</p>
<p>International aid agencies report that North Korea is on the brink of a killer famine, as two consecutive years of record floods have devastated farmlands.</p>
<p>The World Food Programme has called for $95.5 million for 200,000 tons of food and U.S. officials have indicated they also are stepping up their relief efforts.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reported on Thursday that the Pentagon's intelligence agency has estimated that as many as 100,000 North Koreans may die from starvation and diseases related to it in the next four months.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said they believe North Korea's economic plight is edging the Stalinist nation towards agreeing to join talks with South Korea, the United States and China about ending tensions on the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>The United States and South Korea proposed the four-party talks on April 16, 1996, as a way to get to a peace treaty that would finally close the books on the 1950-53 war.</p>
<p>Shalikashvili said his comments on North Korea's continued military prowess were not meant to fuel any "war talk" but he did not see "on the military side any lessening of their (North Korea) capability, nor do I see any reason why we on the military side should not continue to be very vigilant and very ready for the unexpected".</p>
