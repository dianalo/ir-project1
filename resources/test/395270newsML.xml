<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi warned Germany on Friday it had no right to ignore Italy in the drive for European integration and vowed that Rome would be ready in time for the launch of a single currency.</p>
<p>In an impassioned speech to a congress of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the biggest partner in his coalition, Prodi said Italy represented the Mediterranean south of Europe and was vital to the continent's future.</p>
<p>"Europe is not just about a currency, it is impossible to think of Europe cut off from its great Latin culture," Prodi told the packed hall.</p>
<p>"German culture cannot represent by itself all of Europe."</p>
<p>He warned of dire consequences if Italy were excluded.</p>
<p>"If we are not in the first group (of EMU founders), our currency would come under assault, our economy would be defenceless, our international credibility would be diminished," he told delegates.</p>
<p>Prodi, who has pinned his political career on getting the economy ready for the planned launch of economic and monetary union in 1999, said Italy was a whisker away from satisfying the tough criteria laid out in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>He brushed aside worries that the hard-left Communist Refoundation, which guarantees his parliamentary majority and has raised doubts about the outlook for EMU, might scupper the final push towards cleaning up Italy's state accounts.</p>
<p>"Europe is within reach," Prodi said, adding that the government needed to find an additional six to 14 trillion lire ($3.6-$8.4 billion) this year to reduce the closely-watched deficit to gross domestic product to the required three percent.</p>
<p>His centre-left coalition got a boost in its dash for EMU on Friday when Eurostat, the EU office responsible for overseeing government accounting plans, approved a one-off "Euro tax" which Prodi intends to levy later this year to improve state finances.</p>
<p>The decision means the European Union has accepted all measures so far introduced by Italy to subdue its deficit/GDP ratio, which in 1996 ballooned to around seven percent.</p>
<p>Prodi said earlier this week he was already working on a fresh mini-budget, less than two months after parliament gave the green light to a huge 62.5 trillion lire ($37 billion) deficit-cutting package.</p>
<p>Communist Refoundation leader Fausto Bertinotti, speaking earlier to the PDS conference, told delegates that the single currency looked doomed to fail and warned that his party could not back any further cuts in state spending or new tax hikes.</p>
<p>"In Europe there are many doubts about EMU," he said. "Even Germany realises that the neo-liberalist model doesn't work, so how can they expect others to follow their lead?"</p>
<p>Bertinotti is the first leading politician in Italy to openly question EMU's future, but Prodi said he expected the Communists to back his coalition when it came to the crunch.</p>
<p>"I don't have any doubts about the loyalty of our majority," he said.</p>
<p>However he faces a battle at home and abroad to convince everyone that Italy, which is burdened by a huge debt mountain, deserves a place in EMU. He has visited Germany twice in recent days to persuade sceptics there of Italian's eligibility.</p>
<p>On Friday he gave a glowing report on the Italian economy, saying inflation this year would average out at 2.5 percent from 3.9 percent in 1996, while employment rose 0.4 percent last year and was expected to climb strongly in coming months.</p>
