<p>All-rounder Hans Knauss led Austria to another triumph in Val d'Isere on Monday, winning a men's Alpine skiing super-G one day after compatriot Fritz Strobl took the first downhill of the season.</p>
<p>Knauss, who takes the World Cup overall lead away from Norway's Kjetil-Andre Aamodt, beat compatriot Guenther Mader by 0.03 seconds with a time of 1:23.26.</p>
<p>Only Swiss Steve Locher stood in the way of a second Austrian clean sweep of the podium in two days.</p>
<p>Locher, winner of the first giant slalom of the season in Solden last month, took third place in 1:23.43. But Austria still had four men in the top five with downhill world champion Patrick Ortlieb, third on Sunday, missing the super-G podium by 0.26 seconds. Christian Mayer was fifth on 1:23.78.</p>
<p>"You had to be a very good technical skier to win here," said Knauss, who won his first super-G last year in nearby Valoire.</p>
<p>"My main goal this season is to win the super-G World Cup. The rest will be a bonus," added the 25-year-old from Schladming.</p>
<p>But he has shown that he may be capable of doing much better, finishing fourth, third and second in the three giant slaloms held so far this winter.</p>
<p>The results put him firmly in the World Cup overall lead on 297 points, ahead of Aamodt on 234 and Locher, who has 215.</p>
<p>Knauss, who also won a giant slalom in Alta Badia last season, said a nose operation in the spring had solved the breathing problems which had sometimes hampered his performance in the past.</p>
<p>Mader's second place came as a relief for the veteran all-rounder, who had a disastrous downhill on Sunday, finishing 50th.</p>
<p>Locher, another giant slalom specialist, also confirmed his fine early form.</p>
<p>The three men on the podium will be among the favourites in next Sunday's giant slalom in Alta Badia, which should see Italian superstar Alberto Tomba in action.</p>
<p>The Alta Badia race may also see Norway's Lasse Kjus, the World Cup overall winner last season, return from a week at home to recover from sinusitis. Kjus will miss a slalom in Madonna di Campiglio on Tuesday and two downhills in Val Gardena later this week.</p>
<p>The super-G was held in warm and sunny weather, contrasting with the appalling conditions which had forced a women's giant slalom to be called off and a men's downhill to be delayed by 24 hours in the French resort.</p>
<p>Local hero Luc Alphand, sixth in Sunday's downhill, was eighth in the super-G, 0.72 seconds behind Knauss, but he had a reason to celebrate.</p>
<p>"I'm very happy Locher pipped Ortlieb for third place. It would have been a very bad weekend for me if Ortlieb had twice finished on the podium", said the downhill World Cup holder.</p>
<p>The Frenchman and the Austrian have started a war of words this season and their duel, which resumes in Val Gardena, should be one of the highlights of the season.</p>
