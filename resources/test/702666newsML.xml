<p>U.S. government securities prices opened higher Wednesday as investors anticipated that a meeting of Federal Reserve policymakers would end with a decision to hold interest rates steady.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Fed, began a two-day meeting Tuesday that is widely expected to end with an announcement this afternoon that rates will be left unchanged.  </p>
<p>Recent economic data have portrayed a second quarter characterized by subdued inflation and economic growth that slowed from a very brisk first quarter.</p>
<p>In the most recent report, the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) yesterday reported its index for June provided more evidence that healthy economic growth was not fanning worrisome inflation.</p>
<p>Bond prices rose and yields fell on Tuesday as a result of the NAPM report, participants said. Wednesday's early strength was followthrough buying on those gains, they said.  </p>
<p>In early trade, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was up 4/32 to 98-20/32, yielding 6.73 percent.</p>
<p>Two-year notes opened at 99-31/32, up 1/32 to yield 6.02 percent.</p>
<p>"The market has a bid to it that it held on to overnight," said Kim Rupert, senior economist at Standard and Poors MMS. "That helped give a bid to European bonds as well."</p>
<p>Rupert said the market "is pretty sanguine" about the FOMC meeting.</p>
<p>"So (these early gains are) just a continuation of yesterday's gains," she said.  </p>
<p>The only piece of government economic news the market will get today is May factory orders. Economists polled by Reuters forecast a 0.2 percent decline, after a 1.2 percent increase in April.</p>
<p>"Factory orders shouldn't have much impact," said Rupert.</p>
<p>Participants said position-squaring before the government releases the June monthly payroll report on Thursday could be the main feature of trading this afternoon.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters forecast, on average, that payrolls expanded by 222,000 jobs in June and the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.8 percent.  </p>
<p>Average hourly earnings are expected to be up 0.4 percent after a 0.3 percent rise in May.</p>
<p>"The market expects something on the healthy side for payrolls," said Rupert, citing estimates for gains of up to 250,000.</p>
<p>"There's been talk of a risk of a higher number," she added, "so even though we might see a kneejerk down reaction (by the market) on a number like 250,000, by the end of the day that could be absorbed -- as long as the hourly earnings number and the unemployment rate aren't too bad."  </p>
<p>In early dealings, the 10-year note was up 3/32 at 101-13/32, with a yield of 6.43 percent. The five-year note was up 2/32 at 99-24/32, yielding 6.31 percent.</p>
<p>Three-month bills were unchanged at 5.10 percent and six-month bills were unchanged at 5.12 percent. Year bill rates were down one basis point to 5.33 percent.</p>
