<p>Morocco's largest private company ONA Group ceded its minority stake in International Business Machines Corp's subsidiary in Morocco to IBM, the group said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>The IBM unit Elbm was established in Casablanca in 1993, the statement said.</p>
<p>According to 1994 figures, ONA held 49 percent of Elbm capital before the cession.</p>
<p>With a capital of 33.5 million dirhams ($3.8 million), Elbm is now fully controlled by its parent IBM, a Casablanca-based stockbroker said.  </p>
<p>"ONA's withdrawal from Elbm firm is a part of the conglomerate's long term strategy to concentrate on the core business such as mining, finance, agro-industry," the stockbroker said.</p>
<p>One of the largest companies in Africa with holdings in more than 100 firms, ONA Group showed a 20.6 percent rise in its consolidated net profit to 328.6 million dirhams in the six months to June 1996 compared with the first half of 1995.</p>
<p>Market analysts expect ONA's consolidated net profit to reach an estimated 720 million dirhams for the full year 1996.</p>
<p>Established in 1919, ONA Group (former Omnium Nord Africain), has a market capitalisation of more than 8.2 billion dirhams.</p>
