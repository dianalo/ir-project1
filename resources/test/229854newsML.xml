<p>Hong Kong gold ended lower on Monday, continuing its slide on selling from Australia and South Africa, possibly from producers, bullion traders said.</p>
<p>Sentiment was weak as rumours of European central bank sales swirled again through the market, they added.</p>
<p>"It's the banks again," said one bullion trader.</p>
<p>Bullion ended at US$370.00/50 an ounce, approaching closing levels last seen in October 1993, against London's US$371.25/45 close on Friday.</p>
<p>Some traders also reported selling from Japan in morning trade, but producer hedge sales remained the main pressure point hanging over the market, according to a senior bullion source.</p>
<p>"It's a question of how low the producers are willing to see the gold price go," he noted.</p>
<p>An options trader said, "The cost of production is getting higher for Australian miners, and if the gold price goes much lower it will eat into profits and they will get desperate."</p>
<p>"They may start taking out of their long-term hedges to buffer up their short-term hedges," he said, noting that more people were eager to buy puts than sell calls.</p>
<p>Short-term volatilites had bounced back higher to 7.5 percent, from around five percent earlier this month, he added.  </p>
<p>One trader said a few players were covering their short positions, leading to some light buying.</p>
<p>Some bullion dealers saw gold heading to US$368 per ounce, but an official at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society said prices had bottomed and should rebound in the near future.</p>
<p>But industry sources said physical gold buyers had largely abandoned the market, noting almost flat demand.</p>
<p>Local gold ended HK$9 lower at HK$3,420 a tael.</p>
<p>Tael gold continued to trade at a healthy premium over spot gold, providing arbitrage opportunities, traders said.</p>
<p>The carryover charge at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society rose to -1.05, from -5.00 at its previous fix.</p>
