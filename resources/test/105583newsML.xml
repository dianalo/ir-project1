<p>U.S. scientists won five Nobel science prizes on Wednesday, reasserting North America's dominance over the world's most prestigious awards.</p>
<p>Sweden's staid Royal Academy of Sciences also took the unusual step of awarding a Nobel Chemistry Prize for a discovery made just 10 years ago, saying the find may have a momentous effect on life in the next century.</p>
<p>Three U.S. physicists, David Lee, Douglas Osheroff and Robert Richardson, won the Nobel Physics Prize and will share $1.12 million for their work, which inspired colleagues seeking to unlock the mysteries of the creation of the universe.</p>
<p>U.S. scientists Robert Curl and Richard Smalley and Briton Sir Harold Kroto won the Nobel Chemistry Prize for a discovery that promises to be momentous when it is fully understood, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said.</p>
<p>Werdnesday's announcements mean that U.S. and Canadian scientists have won six out of 10 scientific prizes, confirming a widely held view that U.S. colleges are producing the world's best scientific research.</p>
<p>However 1996 has also been a good Nobel vintage for British scientists, who have taken two. As well as Kroto, British professor James Mirrlees, 60, of Cambridge University shared the economics prize on Tuesday with William Vickrey of Canada.</p>
<p>The final 1996 award, the Nobel Peace Prize, will be announced in Oslo on Friday.</p>
<p>The acadaemy, naming the physics prize winners on Wednesday, said the three Americans won it for their quantum physics discovery about the superfluidity of the helium-3 isotope.</p>
<p>The three made a breakthrough in low-temperature physics in the early 1970s at Cornell University in New York State.</p>
<p>"I am overwhelmed and very, very happy," Lee told Swedish national news agency TT by telephone from Cornell University. "We knew we had made a very important discovery, but none of us had expected this."</p>
<p>Lee, born in 1931 in Rye, New York, and Richardson, born in 1937 in Washington, D.C., both work in Cornell University's Department of Physics. Osheroff, born in Aberdeen, Washington State, in 1945, works at the Department of Physics at California's Stanford University.</p>
<p>Nobel committee member Mats Jonson told Reuters there were similarities between the helium-3 superfluid and theories about early stages of the universe and how galaxies formed.</p>
<p>The academy said the three men discovered the helium isotope helium-3 can be made superfluid at a temperature only about two thousandths of a degree above absolute zero.</p>
<p>Superfluidity is a term for when a liquid is made so cold it loses all its usual molecular patterns shortly before it reaches the stage of absolute zero, minus 273.15 degrees centigrade (-459.67F -- Absolute zero -459.68F).</p>
<p>An inexperienced graduate student at the time, Osheroff first noticed a tiny blip in a chart from an impromptu experiment, but had to convince his collaborators, who were senior researchers, of the discovery's significance.</p>
<p>"Osheroff...must have been 25 or 26 years old and he was sitting around and he thought he'd do something to get to know the apparatus," Jonson told Reuters.</p>
<p>"He noticed some glitches in the measurement curve, which could be due to a lot of things -- like something wrong with the apparatus or he was coughing or something...That actually turned out to be the real result."</p>
<p>A few hours later Curl, Smalley and Kroto shared the chemistry prize for the 1985 discovery of a form of the carbon element in the faceted shape of a soccer ball. They dubbed it the fullerene.</p>
<p>Curl, born in 1933 in Alice, Texas, has been professor at Rice University, Houston, since 1967. Smalley, born in 1943 in Akron, Ohio, teaches at the same university.</p>
<p>Kroto, born in 1939 in Wisbech, eastern England, is a professor of chemistry at the University of Sussex, in the southern English town of Brighton.</p>
<p>"This is the greatest day of my life. It's fantastic. I'm about to have my first glass of champagne," he told Reuters by telephone from his office in the University of Sussex.</p>
<p>Professor Carl-Olof Jacobson, permanent secretary of the Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, said it was very rare for a scientific Nobel prize to be awarded within such a short period after the invention.</p>
<p>"This is such a big discovery that it was awarded with a Nobel Prize after only a few years. This makes it more difficult to say already now what it can be used for," Jacobsen said.</p>
<p>The three men discovered the fullerenes over 11 days in 1985 and the discovery has given birth to a new form of chemistry.</p>
<p>The structure, shaped like a football, was called the "Buckminsterfullerene" after U.S. architect R. Buckminster Fuller, for his design of the geodesic dome at the 1967 Montreal World Expo. The dome closely resembles the chemical structure.</p>
<p>"This opened up a vast area of chemistry for the 21st century. Fullerenes could be used in super-conductors and new kinds of compounds and drugs," Kroto said.</p>
<p>"Scientists should have discovered fullerenes 40 years ago but just didn't make the right calculations," said Kroto, who knows how he will spend his share of the $1.12 million prize.</p>
