<p>Serbia will present a heavily changed final version of its draft privatisation law next week, confirming its commitment to further economic reforms, Serbian Privatisation Minister Milan Beko said.</p>
<p>"The conclusive public debate on the privatisation law will be held next Thursday and the law is expected to be adopted by the end of June," Beko told Reuters in an interview on Friday.</p>
<p>Beside slicing discounts and leaving it up to companies to decide whether to privatise, the final version extends the period for a full payment of subscribed shares to six from five years and allows shares to be immediately traded on the market. Most of the details were published this week.</p>
<p>Workers, pensioners and farmers will be given a sort of a share-card, similar to the bank identification card with a number serving as a code for the central depository account.</p>
<p>Beko insisted privatisation enjoyed absolute political backing in Serbia.</p>
<p>Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Danko Djunic, in charge of overall economic reforms and improvement of Yugoslavia's relations with the outside world, insisted reformists enjoyed support from the Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic himself.</p>
<p>"We have not been invited here to take part in some political games but to propose a consistent reform package and that is exactly what we are doing."</p>
<p>"We enjoy President Milosevic's support and any opposition from those who are against reforms only proves they did not really believe that Milosevic was very serious when he said that 1997 will be the year of reforms," Djunic told Reuters.</p>
<p>Doubts began to grow when the government first signalled it would not implement the law immediately but wait to begin with privatisation later this year.</p>
<p>But Djunic insisted time was needed to make all preparations. "Implementation of the privatisation law requires logistic preparation. If we are not properly prepared, the effects of the law would be disastrous."</p>
<p>"We need some time to prepare for the implementation of the law. Meanwhile, we need to establish a central depository stock account, a computerised system and its network established all around Serbia," Beko said.</p>
<p>Beko insisted time was also needed to educate people on privatisation matters and decide on some technicalities such as the currency in which the evalued socially-owned capital will be denominated.</p>
<p>"We need to decide on the Office for Capital Evaluation, operating within the privatisation ministry. The Office will be a part of this ministry. I want to have full responsibility for what I do and this (privatisation) will be a centrally-handled operation," he said.</p>
<p>Beko said the law has undergone some changes but insisted the document was simplified and even improved in some parts.</p>
<p>But analysts said changes were made recently by economic hardliners of the ruling Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) without consulting the expert team entrusted with privatisation from the beginning and while the minister was heavily engaged in talks over sale of 49 percent stake in Telekom Srbija.</p>
<p>Reformist members of the expert team half-heartedly said they would have to swallow a bitter pill along with those changes, but Djunic said: "The pill will not be bitter after all."</p>
<p>Socialist hardliners feared privatisation and radical economic reforms will cause dramatic increases in unemployment and force companies to restructure.</p>
<p>Djunic insisted those dangers were not as big in the case of Yugoslavia whose war-ravaged economy has suffered four years of international isolation.</p>
<p>"I do not expect too many negative effects because we are in a much worse state than other transition economies when they were facing reforms," Djunic said. -- Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
