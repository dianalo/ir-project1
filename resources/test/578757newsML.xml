<p>A senior Croatian delegation will meet U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in Washington on Thursday to discuss Croatia's progress on questions that have slowed its acceptance by the West.</p>
<p>Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic will raise issues such as the tricky reintegration of the last Serb enclave of Croatia, the peace-implementation process in nearby Bosnia, and Croatian-U.S. relations, Hido Biscevic, assistant foreign minister for bilateral affairs, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Croatia is keen to become a paid-up member of Western institutions such as the European Union and NATO's Partnership for Peace military cooperation programme but it knows it must first fulfil stringent conditions.</p>
<p>The EU has shelved negotiations on a cooperation agreement and set conditions which Croatia, led by conservative nationalist President Franjo Tudjman, must meet before talks restart.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the Croatian government sent a letter to Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo, whose country holds the EU rotating presidency, expressing its eagerness to revive the talks.</p>
<p>But Western diplomats are more cautious, saying they will wait and see how smoothly the process of returning Croatian refugees to the enclave of Eastern Slavonia goes before deciding on a timetable.</p>
<p>Treatment of minority Serbs who will have to be resttled elsewhere to make room for returning Croats will also be closely watched. Human-rights observers say Serbs in formerly embattled zones of Croatia have been persecuted.</p>
<p>Biscevic said Croatia wants to discuss "our priorities...European and Atlantic integration and Partnership for Peace, including our firm position that we would expect very soon the resumption of negotiations with the EU.</p>
<p>"I believe we are making progress...We fully recognise that the future position of Croatia within the European context is very much linked to fulfilling these criteria."</p>
<p>Croatia introduced a radical financial stabilisation plan in 1993 and since then has maintained stable exchange rates and low inflation.</p>
<p>It is attracting considerable interest from foreign investors and sees itself as part of central Europe rather than the Balkans which it views as backward and unstable.</p>
<p>The letter to the EU came a day after Croatian President Franjo Tudjman received a note from U.S. President Bill Clinton which said that if terms were met, the United States would support Croatia's integration in the West.</p>
<p>One diplomat said Clinton stressed Croatia would have to comply with the U.N. war crimes tribunal on former Yugoslavia and sincerely support Bosnia's Moslem-Croat federation, bedrock of the U.S.-brokered Dayton peace accord which ended the Yugoslav wars in 1995.</p>
<p>Bicevic said he hoped Thursday's discussion with Albright would reinforce Croatia's "firm support and active engagement" in the peace process.</p>
<p>He said it was important central Bosnian authorities functioned properly if Croatia is to develop genuine bilateral relations with Sarajevo.</p>
<p>The delegation will include Development and Reconstruction Minister Jure Radic, new Economy Minister Nenad Porges and Croatia's ambassador to Washington, Miomir Zuzul.</p>
