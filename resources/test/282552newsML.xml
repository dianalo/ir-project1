<p>AUSTRALIAN PORTS AFFECTED BY TROPICAL CYCLONE PHIL</p>
<p>Sydney, Dec 31 - At 1500 on Dec 30, tropical cyclone Phil was 400 kms north-north-east of Dampier in lat 17.3s, long 118.1e moving southwest at 18 kph. Maximum wind gusts are 150 kph close to the centre. The cyclone is weakening but is expected to move closer to Dampier/Port Walcott in the next 24 hours. A large swell is expected to affect both ports for the next few days and may delay berthing. No vessels are alongside at Port Walcott and none are due before 1200, Dec 31. All vessels are leaving Dampier and putting to sea to avoid the cyclone before 2100 hrs on Tuesday and the port will close.</p>
