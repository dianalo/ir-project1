<p>Shares in Havas rose sharply on Tuesday, boosted by speculation the CLT holding company controlled by Belgian businessman Albert Frere may take a big stake in the French media group.</p>
<p>"Rumours of the rise of Albert Frere are sparking speculation on the stock," a trader said. Le Figaro reported Frere was set to sell his stakes in M6 and digital satellite television venture TPS and exchange CLT shares for a 22 percent holding in Havas. TPS denied the talk.</p>
<p>Havas was up 3.24 percent at 414 francs on volume of 129,751 shares at 1044 GMT.</p>
