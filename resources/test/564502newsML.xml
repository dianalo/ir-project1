<p>The Australian dollar rallied through a choppy morning trade to keep a foothold atop 78 cents.</p>
<p>European selling offshore had threatened to spill it to US$0.7780 support in early trade, but the market was caught short by bids rumoured to be related to the impending issue of one or more yen/A$ dual currency samurai bonds. The resulting squeeze carried it as high as US$0.7832 before the buying died away and the market's caution reasserted itself.</p>
<p>Bullishness was also tempered by a sharp rise in Japanese yields and stock prices which unwound some of the dollar's gains on the yen and may even stir long dormant talk of a BOJ hike.  </p>
<p>By 12.00 pm (0200 GMT) the local dollar was hovering at US$0.7816/21 in two-way trade after an early US$0.7808/13 and Monday's local close of US$0.7823/28.</p>
<p>Support had proved itself solid at SU$0.7795/00 so far while resistance was equally robust above US$0.7830.</p>
<p>On the crosses the currency slipped away to 98.60/70 yen from an early 98.88/98 and 99.04/14 Monday as the yen was buoyed by a sharp 10 basis point rise in the key JGB yield to 2.4 percent. The jump partly reflected the increasing attraction of stocks with the Nikkei index leaping 689 points to 20,204, which in turn promised to fuel economic recovery in Japan.</p>
