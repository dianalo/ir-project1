<headline>Delta Air, Varig end code-sharing pact.</headline>
<dateline>ATLANTA 1997-02-10</dateline>

<p>Delta Air Lines Inc said Varig Brazilian Airlines ended a code-share agreement that began in 1994.</p>
<p>Delta said the exact date for the end of the Varig code-share is now under discussion, but the service is expected to end late this summer.</p>
<p>The deal allowed it to sell seats on Varig flights from Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, and Miami to Brazil.</p>
<p>Delta had previously filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation for authority to operate its own flights to Brazil over routes which become available to U.S. carriers on April 1.</p>
<p>"The new Brazilian authority we are seeking will be the cornerstone of Delta's South America service," said Vince Caminiti, Delta's senior vice president - sales and international.</p>
<p>Delta has proposed a daily round-trip flight operating over a route from Cincinnati to Atlanta to Sao Paulo. A second daily Delta round-trip flight would operate from New York to Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Delta's Cincinnati-Atlanta flight would connect in Sao Paulo to Delta's Rio de Janeiro flight, Delta said.</p>
