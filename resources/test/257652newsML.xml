<p>Suspected Corsican separatists made a rare daytime bomb attack on Sunday, damaging a firm owned by the son of a conservative politician on the north of the French Mediterranean island, police said.</p>
<p>The blast, which caused no casualties, hit the offices of a public works company on the outskirts of the northern port of Bastia.</p>
<p>The firm is run by Pierre Natali, son of Paul Natali, who is a member of Prime Minister Alain Juppe's Rally for the Republic (RPR) party and head of the both the regional council for northern Corsica and the local chamber of commerce.</p>
<p>The family has been targeted by bombers several times in the past two years. Bombers almost always attack at night, in a policy aimed both at avoiding detection and mimimising casualties.</p>
<p>Before dawn on Sunday, suspected separatists sprayed bullets at a paramilitary police barracks in Bastia where several gendarmes were working at the time.</p>
<p>No one was hurt in the attack, the fourth such attack in three years against the building. Gendarmes found 16 marks of bullets from an automatic weapon on the facade of the Montesoro barracks.</p>
<p>No one immediately claimed responsibility for either attack.</p>
<p>Six people were still in detention on Sunday after being seized on Friday over suspected links to a separatist extortion racket and a bomb attack on a golf club, officials said.</p>
<p>Investigators are hoping the case could prove a watershed in a battle against a widely-rumoured "revolutionary tax" levied by guerrillas on hoteliers, restaurant owners and others in a mafia-style protection racket.</p>
<p>Police have been unable to investigate properly the alleged cash-for-protection tax before now because no one had filed a detailed legal complaint before the owners of the Sperone golf club.</p>
<p>President Jacques Chirac reaffirmed government pledges of a crackdown on the guerrillas in a television interview on Thursday.</p>
