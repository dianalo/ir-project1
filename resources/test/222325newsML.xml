<p>The international humanitarian mission to central Africa will be approved on Friday at a meeting in Ottawa, Canada announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>"We have now achieved an agreement," Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy said in a statement, adding that more than 20 nations had offered support for a mission. Ambassadors from those countries will meet in Ottawa as a "steering board" to give final confirmation.</p>
<p>The agreement is to establish a multinational headquarters in Uganda, pursue further reconnaissance and put in place the capability to carry out airdrops of food into eastern Zaire if needed. The project is aimed at bringing food to Rwandan Hutu refugees still in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>There were an estimated 1.2 million refugees before fighting between the rebels, Zairian troops and Hutu extremists forced them from their camps. In mid-November up to 600,000 went home to Tutsi-dominated Rwanda, which they fled in 1994 fearing reprisals for the genocide of up to a million Tutsis and moderate Hutus.</p>
<p>The Canadian-led international coalition appeared determined to go ahead with its plans despite opposition from the Zairian information minister to food drops and scepticism from relief workers that this was the route to go.</p>
<p>Asked if the cooperation of neighbouring Rwanda was required for convoys, Axworthy said: "That would be one of the questions. I'm hoping ... from what we've seen today that the Rwandan government is showing more cooperation."</p>
<p>He said Rwanda had agreed to allow the force commander, Canadian Lt. Gen. Maurice Baril, to scout around eastern Zaire on Thursday and agreed to allow relief agencies to investigate the needs there for 10 days.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council authorised an international force on Nov. 15, but no mission has yet begun, partly because of confusion on the need after the return of around 600,000 refugees to Rwanda and partly because the Rwandan government has refused to allow the force to operate from its territory.</p>
<p>The United States, France, Belgium, South Africa, Malawi, Senegal, Denmark and Japan were among those that had offered support, for example with planes, reconnaissance and staff for the headquarters, Axworthy said.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council's authorisation of an international force to assist in the return of refugees and in the delivery of aid was under Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter, which allows member countries to proceed with air, sea or land operations to maintain or restore international peace and security in carrying out Security Council tasks.</p>
<p>Axworthy said Canada had 600 troops devoted to the mission, just under 300 of whom are in the region, along with three Hercules transport planes that can be used for drops.</p>
<p>A figure for the total force was not available but Senegal was contributing a battalion of 800, Canadian defence officials said. France was sending two aircraft and 50 personnel and the United States was helping to set up the headquarters at Entebbe in Uganda and would assist in planning airdrops.</p>
