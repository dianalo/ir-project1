<p>Canada's ruling Liberals have maintained a strong lead over their rivals ahead of an expected election call on Sunday, according to a new poll released on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Angus Reid/Southam News poll, taken on April 16-22, showed support for the governing Liberals rose 1 percentage point since late March to 42 percent of the decided vote. This was one point higher than the level of support they received in the October 1993 election.</p>
<p>There was little change in support for the Liberals' closest rivals, the Conservative party. They were defeated by the Liberals in 1993, and support was steady at 18 percent of voters.</p>
<p>The right-wing Reform Party saw its support fall one point from last month to 16 percent, while the separatist Bloc Quebecois had 13 percent of voter support nationally. The left-wing New Democrats had 11 percent support.</p>
<p>The Liberals, led by Prime Minister Jean Chretien, were widely expected to call an election on Sunday for June 2.</p>
<p>The Angus Reid poll was conducted by telephone with a cross-section of 1,513 Canadian adults. The firm said the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.</p>
<p>"We think the numbers are pretty much an off and running signal for the governing Liberals," Bob Richardson, vice-president with the Angus Reid Group, told Reuters. He said the numbers appeared to point to a majority government for the Liberals.</p>
<p>Richardson said one of the Liberals' few problems was momentum. The poll showed 33 percent of voters surveyed said their opinion of Chretien and the Liberal party had worsened over the past few months, compared to only 9 percent of those who said their opinion had improved.</p>
<p>However, the Liberals continue to have the most support of any party in every region of Canada except Quebec. There, the separatist Bloc Quebecois hold 49 percent of the decided Quebec vote, the same as their actual 1993 showing. The Chretien Liberals remain at 36 percent, up three points from 1993 but down from earlier in their mandate.</p>
