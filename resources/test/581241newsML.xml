<p>Greek interbank depos from three-to 12-month started lower five to 10 basis points, short-term forex forwards were easier, ecu/drachma was ranging and bonds were biased on the upside, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Three-to 12-month depos are down about 10 basis points," said a trader at a private bank. "Short-run forex forwards are easier."</p>
<p>Expectations of lower inflation, interest rates and ample liquidity accounted for the drop, the dealer said.</p>
<p>The central bank cut its discount, Lombard and overdraft rates by 100 basis rates to 14.5 percent, 19 percent and 24 percent today.</p>
<p>It justified its decision on Monday by citing falling inflation and the need to bring the rates closer to interbank rates.</p>
<p>Bond traders said trading activity was subdued but prices had an upward bias.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 159.53/63 from Monday's 159.930 fix, the dollar at 271.39/49 drachmas from 270.500 and the ecu at 310.52/62 from 310.520 drachmas.</p>
<p>The central bank has signalled to the market that it does not consider the 310.50/80 level to be a ceiling and therefore it might be seen it even higher, a trader said.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Greece, the domestic money market's biggest player, quoted the following early rates:</p>
<p>** Overnight at  9.80-10.30</p>
<p>** T/N at  9.80-10.30</p>
<p>** S/N at  9.80-10.30</p>
<p>** One week at 9.80-10.30</p>
<p>** Two weeks at 9.80-10.30</p>
<p>** Three weeks at 9.80-10.30</p>
<p>** One month at  9.80-10.30</p>
<p>** Two months at  9.80-10.30</p>
<p>** Three months at 9.80-10.30</p>
<p>** Six months at  9.85-10.35</p>
<p>** Nine months at 9.90-10.40</p>
<p>** Twelve months at 9.90-10.40</p>
