<p>Newspaper publisher John Fairfax Holdings Ltd said on Friday that results since the start of the second half of its financial year on January 1 had been encouraging but continued improvement depended on the economy.  </p>
<p>"Whilst economic conditions remain poor in some sectors, the company's results since December 31 have been encouraging," Fairfax said in a statement accompanying first half results.</p>
<p>"Continued improvement will be dependent upon economic growth," the company said.</p>
<p>Fairfax announced a net profit of A$46.95 million for the six months to December 31, down from A$62.38 million a year earlier.  </p>
<p>Fairfax said the decline in profit was primarily attributable to higher newsprint costs and increased interest and depreciation charges relating to its new printing plant at Chullora in Sydney, commissioned in February last year.</p>
<p>It noted that earnings before interest and tax of A$129.5 million for the half year represented a 3.6 percent decline on the previous half. However, this comprised a 16 percent fall in the first quarter and a 10 percent rise in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Operating revenue was flat after lower advertising volumes were offset by higher advertising rates.  </p>
<p>Fairfax said it continued to benefit from improved efficiencies at Chullora and editorial pre-press production.</p>
<p>"Total costs fell 1.9 percent in the second quarter despite the impact of higher newsprint prices," the company said.</p>
<p>Overall classified advertising volumes were down three percent for The Sydney Morning Herald and one percent for The Age in Melbourne, Fairfax said.</p>
<p>Real estate, motor vehicle and commercial property advertising improved, but combined employment advertising was down 14 percent in The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald.  </p>
<p>Fairfax said an improving trend in advertising volumes was recorded in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Circulation of the weekday edition of The Sydney Morning Herald rose one percent, and the Saturday edition four percent.</p>
<p>Circulation of the weekday edition of The Age rose seven percent, and the Saturday edition two percent.</p>
<p>Fairfax said its Australian Financial Review business daily achieved another record daily circulation of 85,563 copies which it said continued the strong growth of the last two years.</p>
