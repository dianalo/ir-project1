<p>U.S. municipal bond trading was extremely quiet in early Monday action, as traders said prices would probably be slightly softer if any actually changed hands.</p>
<p>"Mondays have been very frustrating," one trader said, referring to the lack of activity that has characterized the start of the week in recent months.</p>
<p>But the trader noted that the government long bond was down 12/32 at 98-20/32 to yield 6.61 percent, and futures are also lower. Muni cash would probably be slightly softer as a result, he said.  </p>
<p>The softness comes following Friday's session, when municipals gained 3/8 point to as much as 1/2 point in spots, as unsold bonds from last week's new issues continued to hold back a stronger rally.</p>
<p>This week's supply is not as heavy as in recent weeks, as the holiday approaches.</p>
<p>Scheduled competitive and negotiated municipal bond sales are expected to total $3.14 billion in 109 offerings for the week, according to Reuters Municipal Bond Information Group.  </p>
<p>Competitive sales total $680 million in 65 issues. The largest issue is a $130 million King County, Wash., issue on Monday.</p>
<p>Negotiated sales total $2.46 billion in 44 offerings. The largest is a $626 million New York City deal through Lehman Brothers. New York officials said they received about $112 million of retail orders for the deal last week ahead of Tuesday's expected pricing.</p>
<p>In the muni secondary, bids on Dade County, Fla., FGIC 5-1/2s of 2025 were up two basis points to 5.69 percent net. Texas Turnpike Authority FGIC 5-1/4s of 2023 were unchanged at 5.64 percent net.</p>
<p>Muni futures were flat, with the March contract unchanged at 115-18/32. March T-bonds, meanwhile, were 5/32 lower at 113-3/32. The MOB spread widened to 79 ticks from 74 at the close on Friday.</p>
