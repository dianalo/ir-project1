<p>Western countries hoped to resume mass evacuations from Albania's chaotic capital on Saturday as authorities portrayed themselves as keeping in check rebels seeking President Sali Berisha's resignation.</p>
<p>European efforts to end the lawlessness exposed deep divisions. Top negotiator Franz Vranitzky said outside military intervention was vital, but German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said Bonn had no intention of deploying peacekeeping troops and was "extremely sceptical" about such a plan.</p>
<p>Berisha appeared on television with his new prime minister and members of an all-party cabinet he approved this week after long resistance to the idea. He said Albanians had to expend their own efforts in addition to the military aid it requested from NATO's European members -- the Western European Union.</p>
<p>"Despite the request to the Western European Union (WEU) to help with military force for a political solution...we should make every effort to come out of this crisis," the television quoted Berisha as saying. "I will hold talks with the parties to set up reconciliation committees in all the districts."</p>
<p>Marine Colonel Emerson Gardner, a U.S. commander, said he believed Washington's evacuation, suspended after picking up 408 Americans, could resume on Saturday despite two helicopters coming under ground fire from machine guns. He said a further 200 Americans were waiting to leave.</p>
<p>Military officials said the helicopters had returned fire about two miles (3 km) from where Americans were picked up.</p>
<p>German troops exchanged frantic gunfire with unidentified Albanians who shot at some of 120 European evacuees and helicopters sent to rescue them. One Albanian was slightly hurt.</p>
<p>An Italian military helicopter involved in the airlift was hit by small arms fire over Tirana, but no one was hurt. Four French helicopters brought out about 100 people and an Italian warship a further 800 foreigners and Albanians.</p>
<p>Authorities made high-profile attempts to calm residents after mass looting confined to the south spread to Tirana and most other parts of the country over a 48-hour period.</p>
<p>Police armoured vehicles pushed down cobbled, tree-lined boulevards in mid-afternoon, their hatches occupied by men pointing automatic weapons skyward. A convoy of vans followed.</p>
<p>A curfew introduced as part of emergency rule two weeks ago was brought forward by one hour to 7 p.m. By nightfall, tension and shooting had subsided from 24 hours earlier.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Bashkim Fino announced that the head of the sinister secret police, Bashkim Gazidede, had resigned and the force would be controlled by the government and not the president.</p>
<p>Gazidede's departure was a key demand of rebels who seized most of southern Albania at the outbreak of unrest initially sparked by the collapse of popular but shady investment funds.</p>
<p>Fino said he had discussed with Vranitzky, former Austrian leader, the possible creation of an international force to help restore order in the country.</p>
<p>Vranitzky, who also saw rebel leaders aboard an Italian frigate in the Adriatic, told reporters back in Vienna that outside help was needed quickly.</p>
<p>"The Albanian government has cried out for outside support in the form of military and police force participation," said Vranitzky, who represents the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. "I will report that there is no alternative (to foreign intervention) as far as I can see."</p>
<p>European Union foreign ministers examine Albania's crisis at a weekend meeting in the Netherlands, but diplomats expected little to come of it. An emergency meeting of NATO ambassadors this week showed limited enthusiasm for military intervention.</p>
