<p>Portuguese Prime Minister Antonio Guterres, a Socialist, congratulated Tony Blair on Friday on his crushing victory in Britain's general election, calling it a triumph for a new type of Socialist idealism in Europe.</p>
<p>"This is not only a great victory for you but also for the new Socialist ideals and for the social emphasis on the construction of Europe," Guterres said in a personal message to the Labour Party leader.</p>
<p>Portugal's Socialist Party won power in a parliamentary election in 1995 also after suffering a long period in opposition during which it shed much of its left-wing dogma.</p>
<p>Blair's victory took the Labour Party back to power in Britain for the first time since 1979.</p>
<p>"There is a great similarity in points of view between the 'New Labour' and the Portuguese Socialists," Guterres said.</p>
<p>He added that he looked forward to a period of "closer and deeper" cooperation between their governments, particularly on issues relating to the European Union of which both are members.</p>
<p>"Portugal needs a United Kingdom deeply committed, like us, to the construction of Europe," he said.</p>
