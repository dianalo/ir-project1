<p>Australia fast bowler Anthony Stuart claimed a hat-trick in a five-wicket haul as Pakistan struggled to 181 for nine in 50 overs in their limited overs World Series match on Thursday.</p>
<p>Stuart, playing in only his third one-day match for his country, dismissed Ijaz Ahmed, Mohammad Wasim and wicketkeeper Moin Khan in successive deliveries to rout Pakistan's top order.</p>
<p>The lanky New South Wales paceman became only the second Australian bowler -- and the 12th in the world -- to take a hat-trick in a limited overs international.</p>
<p>After staggering to 29 for five, the tourists were rescued by opener Inzamam-ul-Haq with a hard-hitting 64 and an equally belligerent 33 from captain and all-rounder Wasim Akram.</p>
<p>It was a spirited bowling performance by Australia after they failed to qualify for the final of the triangular tournament, their worst limited overs performance at home for 17 years.</p>
<p>In a devastating early burst, Stuart took the first five wickets to fall in the space of 14 deliveries from the southern end at a miserly cost of just one run.</p>
<p>In his sixth over with the new ball, Stuart lured Ijaz and Wasim to edge faint catches to wicketkeeper Ian Healy before Moin deflected a thicker edge to Australia captain Mark Taylor at first slip.</p>
<p>With the best-of-three final against West Indies starting in Sydney on Saturday, Inzamam made a timely return to form after being promoted up the order.</p>
<p>Inzamam smashed five fours on his way to half-century and his score amounted to more than half his side's total at the time of his dismissal in the 36th over.</p>
<p>Almost inevitably, given his superb figures of five for 26 in 10 overs, Stuart played a role in Inzamam's dismissal, taking a fine low catch on the boundary to remove the burly right-hander.</p>
<p>Fielding at deep mid-off, Stuart repeated the trick to catch all-rounder Shahid Afridi for 29 to complete an outstanding personal performance.</p>
<p>His hat-trick was the first by an Australian in a one-day international since fast bowler Bruce Reid in Sydney in January 1986.</p>
