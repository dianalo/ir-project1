<p>Tobacco companies could face a double-digit drop in U.S. sales when they pass on the cost of a possible $300 billion deal to settle massive legal claims.</p>
<p>Analyst Gary Black of Sanford Bernstein said U.S. consumption would drop about 12 percent, based on the experience of past price increases.</p>
<p>But industry analysts also said Thursday the reported $300 billion paid over 25 years was probably on the high side.</p>
<p>"It's much too high. I think it's an opening shot by the anti-tobacco lobby," said Martin Feldman of Smith Barney.  </p>
<p>The talks to end government, individual and class-action suits seeking billions of dollars in damages cover proposals for a $300 billion fund for sick smokers; sharp limits on advertising; and regulation of tobacco by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>A deal may take weeks or months, but passage by Congress of laws sheltering the industry from lawsuits will probably take a year or two, analysts said. Some anti-tobacco senators in Washington have already questioned the terms.  </p>
<p>A 12 percent drop would cut industry leader Philip Morris' pre-tax profits by about $500 million a year and the profits of RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp -- the second largest U.S. cigarette maker -- by some $170 million, Sanford Bernstein's Black said.</p>
<p>Roy Burry, analyst at Oppenheimer &amp; Co, said the price rises would likely be gradual, costing the industry only $6 billion in the first year after a deal and the effects would vary from company to company.</p>
<p>Shipments at Philip Morris, with its market-dominant Marlboro brand, would fall only about six percent.  </p>
<p>"We would start with a 25 cent initial increase, or 10-15 percent, and a six percent decline in volume," he said of Philip Morris.</p>
<p>Feldman said in a report that cigarette consumption is not necessarily controlled by prices. In many countries, taxes constitute a much greater share of retail prices than in the United States. Taxes on a typical 20 cigarette pack account for 29 percent of the retail price in the U.S., but for 77 percent in Ireland, 74 percent in Australia and 56 percent in Canada.</p>
<p>The analysts said a global settlement, even with a $300 billion price tag, would raise the value of tobacco properties because many legal worries would have been cleared away.</p>
<p>Black expected that, over time, Philip Morris would rise to around 60 from 42-1/4 on Thursday and RJR Nabisco to 48 from 32-3/4.</p>
<p>Feldman agreed, saying: "The businesses will remain very profitable and the legal risks that have been keeping valuations down will have disappeared."</p>
