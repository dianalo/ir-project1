<headline>China oil firm says disputed rig being withdrawn.</headline>

<p>An official of China's main offshore oil firm said on Friday that an oil exploration rig operating in disputed waters near Vietnam had completed its work and was being withdrawn.</p>
<p>Drilling by China's Kan Tan III oil rig off the coast of central Vietnam last month sparked a diplomatic row between Hanoi and Beijing, but both sides have agreed to talks over the issue.  </p>
<p>"The exploration work (of the Kan Tan III) has been completed, the plan is for it to leave during these two days," said an official of the China National Offshore Oil Corp.</p>
<p>He said it was not clear if the Kan Tan III had already left the area where it had been drilling exploratory wells between China's tropical Hainan Island and Vietnam's central coast, but said the rig's withdrawal was assured.</p>
<p>"Since the work is finished, why would it not leave?" the official said.</p>
<p>A Vietnamese spokesman said on Thursday that Hanoi and Beijing would hold expert-level talks in the Chinese capital on April 9 to resolve the dispute over sovereignty of the potentially gas-rich South China Sea area.</p>
<p>China moved its Kan Tan III exploration rig into the area on March 7, a move that sparked verbal sparring between the communist neighbours.</p>
