<p>The Pentagon said on Tuesday it was investigating a 1991 Gulf War intelligence report suggesting U.S. troops might have been close to mustard gas allegedly used by Iraqi forces against rebel Shiites in Iraq.</p>
<p>But Navy Capt. Mike Doubleday, a Defence Department spokesman, stressed it was "raw intelligence" that had not been fully evaluated and that the Pentagon did not know if gas was even used by Iraqi forces near Basra in March 1991.</p>
<p>The Birmingham News said in a copyrighted story this week that the report indicated U.S. troops at the end of the war were so close to chemical arms used to end a Shiite rebellion in southern Iraq that they watched as refugees suffering from mustard gas burns passed through coalition lines.</p>
<p>"I believe that there is a not-finally-evaluated intelligence report that refers to such a possibility," Doubleday told reporters when asked about the story.</p>
<p>"We are looking into it and I think at this juncture we ought to hold off until we can come to some conclusion on this," he added.</p>
<p>Doubleday's comments came only weeks after the Pentagon conceded that at least 15,000 and perhaps many more U.S. Gulf War troops might have been exposed to the deadly chemical nerve agent Sarin in the 1991 destruction of an Iraqi ammunition dump in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>The chemical arms issue, in which the Pentagon has denied ignoring medical complaints of thousands of Gulf War veterans or trying to cover up information, has become a major military and political controversy in Washington.</p>
<p>The Central Intelligence Agency is now developing a computer model for the Pentagon which could indicate that thousands of additional U.S. troops might have been exposed to fallout from a drifting cloud from the Kamasiyah ammunition dump in March 1991.</p>
<p>The U.S. government, on orders from President Bill Clinton, last year mounted a major effort to resolve medical complaints from as many as 60,000 U.S. Gulf War veterans. The complaints ranged from numbness to memory loss, but no common cause or so-called Gulf War illness was found .</p>
<p>Doubleday stressed that the Pentagon still had no evidence that Iraq used any chemical agents during the Gulf War or that any U.S. troops were exposed to such agents, although it continues to evaluate thousands of complaints.</p>
<p>As for the mustard gas report, he confirmed the Birmingham News story that the intelligence information was mistakenly released by the Pentagon last year on its computer information site on the internet, then withdrawn for security reasons.</p>
<p>But Doubleday did not explain why a five-year-old report was now being investigated so late except to say that it was part of the in-depth probe ordered by Clinton.</p>
<p>Recently published reports have suggested that more than 100,000 U.S. troops from several divisions might have been exposed to fallout from the massive white cloud from the Kamisiyah explosion.</p>
<p>Initial reports in June indicated that only a small number of troops from a U.S. engineering battalion were involved in destroying weapons in a bunker, but the new report included a pit several miles (kilometers) from the bunker.</p>
