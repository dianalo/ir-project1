<p>CSCE coffee futures ended mixed in thin turnover Tuesday, with the nearby contracts advancing after a late-session bout of commission house buying, trading sources said.</p>
<p>Prices spent much of the day clinging toward unchanged with locals seen on both sides of the market, and the trade and speculators largely sitting the session out, dealers said.</p>
<p>December delivery ended up 1.10 cents a lb, to 118.85, having traded from 119.00 to 116.80. Second-position March rose 0.85 cent, to 107.90, while the remaining months finished 0.80 higher to 0.25 lower.</p>
<p>Traders said the weekly certified stock data, which showed a decline of 743 60-kg bags in the week ended November 1, to 804 bags, had little effect on the market.</p>
<p>"Half of nothing is nothing," one trader said. "It was not enough to get worked up about."</p>
<p>Additionally, the CSCE reported Monday no coffee was pending grading or recertification.</p>
<p>The nearby December/March switch -- the barometer of nearby availability -- moved in under 10.00 cents at this morning after a round of light profit taking, but ended at 10.95 cents, up from 10.70 cents at the close on Monday.</p>
<p>Technically, traders said the December contract faced near-term resistance at 120.25, with strong resistance seen at 123.00. Near-term chart support was seen near 116.50.</p>
<p>In other news, the Brazilian Ministry of Industry and Commerce said Tuesday exports of coffee beans and soluble coffee surged 47 percent in October to 125,000 tonnes, compared to 85,000 tonnes in September.</p>
<p>The ministry said in a statement that receipts from coffee exports totalled $285 million in October, $90 million more than in the previous month.</p>
<p>The day's volume was fairly light, at an estimated 5,337 lots.</p>
