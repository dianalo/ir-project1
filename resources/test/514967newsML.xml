<p>Sweden's supplementary budget calculations include the proposed sale of state shares in Nordbanken worth 17 billion crowns in 1997, the Finance Department said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>"We have in our calculations counted on a sale of the state's shares in Nordbanken this year," ministry spokesman Stefan Ackerby told a press seminar.</p>
<p>"In the estimate we have set income (from the sale) at 17 billion crowns but the stake is today worth much more."</p>
<p>Ackerby said, however, that it was uncertain whether the government would sell its 59.4 percent stake in Nordbanken this year.</p>
<p>"If the government chooses not to sell its shares in Nordbanken this year, the debt to GDP ratio will grow by about 0.5 percent compared to 1996 instead of falling by that amount," Ackerby said.</p>
<p>State debt amounted to 77.7 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 1996 and the Finance Department has forecast it will fall to 77.1 percent this year, assuming a sale of Nordbanken shares.</p>
<p>In total, the Finance Department expects to get 25 billion crowns from selling state shares this year and 10 billion crowns in 1998, Ackerby said. In 1999 and 2000, the department does not expect any revenue from privatisations.</p>
<p>The 1997 sum includes seven-eight billion crowns of payment for the government's 34 percent stake in mortgage lender Stadshypotek, which banking group Handelsbanken is buying, he said.</p>
