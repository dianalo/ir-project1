<p>Kevin Maxwell, youngest son of media tycoon Robert Maxwell, whose death in 1991 led to the collapse of his business empire, will not face a second trial on fraud charges, a judge ruled on Thursday.</p>
<p>Judge John Buckley said a further trial "would be unfair, so unfair as to amount to an abuse of power of the court", adding that he had come to the clear view that the proceedings served no further public interest.</p>
<p>The judge later agreed verdicts of "not guilty" should be recorded on all outstanding charges against Kevin and his three fellow defendants.</p>
<p>He ordered their costs -- around 30 million pounds ($46 million) in Britain's most expensive criminal case this century -- paid from state funds.</p>
<p>The judge's ruling ended five years of controversy over hundreds of millions of pounds which were found missing from Maxwell company pension funds after Robert Maxwell disappeared from his yacht in the Atlantic Ocean.</p>
<p>"It is an enormous victory for commonsense and humanity. I'm enormously relieved, immensely relieved and delighted," an ecstatic and clearly stunned Kevin told a pack of reporters outside the court.</p>
<p>"It's a hell of a moment. Quite clearly this was a very powerful and uncompromising judgement. Thank God he stopped it."</p>
<p>In January, Kevin, his brother Ian Maxwell, and former Maxwell director Larry Trachtenberg were acquitted of conspiring to defraud pension funds after an eight-month trial.</p>
<p>"My immediate reaction is not one of anger or bitterness and I don't want to use words like vindictive or vendetta -- let other people do that," said Kevin.</p>
<p>Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) sought to bring charges in a second trial against Kevin Maxwell, Trachtenberg, and two former Maxwell executives, Albert Fuller and Michael Stoney.</p>
<p>All had proceedings stopped against them under the ruling.</p>
<p>The judgement brings into question how the SFO, set up to deal with major financial fraud, will act in the future.</p>
<p>"We have reached the end of the legal process," said SFO director George Staple in a statement. "The law does not provide any avenue of appeal. There are serious implications for the prosecution of the largest and most complex criminal cases."</p>
<p>Sources close to the SFO said the judge's decision would put it in an impossible position when it came to tackling the largest and most important frauds and reopen the debate over whether juries are qualified to hear complex fraud cases.</p>
<p>The judge said that the factor that had influenced him most was, "(that) the essential criminality of the prosecution's case was before the jury in the first trial."</p>
<p>"Broadly speaking, if any jury was going to convict in this case, surely it would have been on the pension counts (at the first trial)," he told the court.</p>
<p>Kevin Maxwell, 37, had taken his case before the judge to argue that the impending second trial was "oppressive".</p>
<p>At a news conference, Kevin thanked the judge and said he would not consider a lawsuit against the prosecutors. "I have an absolute horror of litigation," he said. "I have no intention of going into a court of law."</p>
<p>Lawyers expressed surprise when the SFO said it wanted a second trial and many said the organisation was trying to salvage its own reputation but, on Thursday, the judge said the verdict in the first trial must now be accepted.</p>
<p>"In a notorious case, people looking on will have their own theories, some better informed than others. But, since we have a jury system we should all accept their verdicts," Buckley said. "In the Maxwell case that is overdue. I accept the jury's verdict. These proceedings are stayed."</p>
<p>Kevin became Britain's biggest bankrupt in 1992 with debts of over 400 million pounds ($630 million at current rates). He was released from bankruptcy in 1995.</p>
<p>Kevin -- whose ambition in life had been to follow his father -- always denied conspiring to defraud by misusing pension fund money to prop up the indebted companies.</p>
<p>He said his father, whom he has described as as bully, used pension funds just like any other assets in his corporate empire -- as a source of cash to be moved from one company to another.</p>
<p>Kevin told the first trial that he and his brother had merely obeyed their father's orders.</p>
