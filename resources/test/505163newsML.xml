<p>Former South African Rugby Union (SARU) players and administrators on Sunday condemned the breakaway action being taken by former Transvaal Rugby Union vice-president Brian van Rooyen.</p>
<p>The former SARU players and administrators, who met in Cape Town with representatives of the South African Rugby Football Union (SARFU), also cemented ties with their country's controlling body in the sport.</p>
<p>Chairman of the meeting Ivor Opperman, who is also president of the S.A. Rugby Veterans Association, issued a statement afterwards which condemned the actions of Brian van Rooyen - as well as a meeting van Rooyen is alleged to be organising with other ex-SARU members in Kimberley later this month.</p>
<p>"Mr van Rooyen has no mandate to speak for us and he must not be allowed to upset the process of unification that we have ratified again here today. We are SARFU and SARFU is SARU. There can be no talk of a split between us," Opperman said.</p>
<p>"This meeting today condemned in the strongest possible manner both the organisers and the meeting in Kimberley. Anyone trying to force a wedge between SARFU and ex-SARU members is doing irreparable harm to our game in South Africa."</p>
<p>Van Rooyen, who earlier this year called for an in-depth inquiry into the administration of South African rugby after a falling-out with SARFU president Louis Luyt, is due to appear before a SARFU disciplinary hearing for bringing the sport into disrepute.</p>
<p>In his statement, Opperman also affirmed the process of unification between SARU and the South African Rugby Board (SARB) which began in 1992.</p>
<p>"The old SARU players and administrators recognised today once again that we ourselves are a part of SARFU and we are happy to remain a part of that structure."</p>
<p>"Former SARU members can be role models to our future rugby stars and we also need to assist SARFU so that talented youngsters are given the opportunities they deserve."</p>
<p>Chief executive officer of SARFU, Rian Oberholzer, who was also at the meeting, said SARU's former members had an important role to play in the future development of rugby in South Africa.</p>
<p>"This meeting has resolved to set up a strategic advisory committee, comprising ex-SARU members drawn from all regions of South Africa, to give guidance and feedback on our development programmes - especially in underprivileged areas - and how they can be improved," Oberholzer said.</p>
