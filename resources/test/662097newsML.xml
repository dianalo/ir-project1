<p>World champion Jansher Khan moved a step closer a successful defence of his Al Ahram International squash title on Sunday night when he beat English seventh seed Simon Parke 15-11 15-5 5-15 15-13.</p>
<p>The Pakistani, who dropped the third game of the quarter-final contest in just three hands from 2-1, recovered to take the fourth game narrowly on a weak, tired forehand onto the tin by Parke.</p>
<p>But Jansher was full of praise for his rival. "Simon played very well and showed that he is back among the top group," Jansher said.</p>
<p>In the women's singles, second-seeded Australian Michelle Martin brushed past Jane Martin of England 9-3 9-5 9-2 to become thethird from her country to reach the last four.</p>
