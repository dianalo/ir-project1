<p>Enron Corp plans to sell a minority stake in its newly formed energy services business this year to shoulder costs of building a U.S. electric and natural gas retail franchise, Chairman Ken Lay said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The company is considering selling 10 percent to 15 percent of Enron Energy Services, which is poised to compete in the $200 billion a year U.S. electric and gas market opening to competition beginning next year, he said.</p>
<p>"We would use the proceeds from that, particularly the gain from that sale, strictly to offset the losses that we are incurring in the start-up phase," Lay said. "We could in fact as we go forward reduce the start-up losses to zero for reporting purposes."</p>
<p>Enron Energy Services posted a $25 million or $0.07 a share loss in the second quarter as the company prepared for the advent of retail competition in early 1998.</p>
<p>The loss partially offset $59 million in earnings before interest and taxes generated by Enron Capital &amp; Trade Resources, the company's wholesale electric and gas operation.</p>
<p>The wholesale unit boosted physical volumes marketed in the second quarter by 20 percent to 11.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (TBtued) compared to 9.3 TBtued in the same period last year, Enron said.</p>
<p>In the United States, Enron's power marketing business sold 38.6 million megawatt hours in the second quarter versus 11 million megawatt hours sold in the second quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>The company expects to begin signing up customers this autumn ahead of planned openings of retail electric markets in California and New England on January 1, 1998.</p>
