<p>TST/Impreso Inc, which makes paper products for offices, said Tuesday its earnings could recover in the next year, as recent paper mill price increases suggested paper industry inventories were improving.</p>
<p>The company also said it would expand its specialty paper manufacturing capabilities, in anticipation of increased demand for specialty papers under its new trademark licensing pact with International Business Machines Corp.</p>
<p>TST/Impresio reported a third quarter earnings loss of $0.07 per share compared to a profit of $0.16 per share in the year-ago third quarter.  </p>
<p>Marshall Sorokwasz, TST/Impresio chief executive, said the company considered the operating results satisfactory given severe pricing pressures in most of its markets during the past several months.</p>
<p>But he said the company had increased product prices twice since the end of the third quarter, due to price hikes at paper mills.</p>
<p>"This suggests that inventories within the paper industry are coming back into balance and that our earnings should recover during the upcoming fiscal year," he said.</p>
<p>In May, TST/Impreso entered a trademark licensing deal with IBM involving the manufacture and distribution of a select line of paper products within the United States, Canada and Mexico.</p>
