<p>The Bulgarian lev firmed to 635-640 per dollar at the close from 640-650 in the morning in low interbank volume, dealers said.</p>
<p>They reported subsiding dollar demand amid low lev liquidity and expectations of a further lev rise.</p>
<p>"Dollar supply rose due to low lev liquidity of some banks, while demand from banks and clients was relatively low, which helped the lev gain slightly," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Trade was light, and calm, mainly due to two measures on banks' liquidity imposed recently by the central bank, dealers said.</p>
<p>The central bank was not seen buying dollars today, dealers said. Central bank officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) on Monday raised minimum reserve requirements for local banks to 11 percent from 10 percent of deposits they have attracted in December in a bid to drain liqidity ahead of large interest and maturity payments on government securities in January.</p>
<p>Last week the BNB cut to 30 percent the portion of banks' minimum reserves at the BNB, which banks can use on an average daily basis for emergency refinancing each month. That portion stood at 50 percent until December 27. @ -- Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-876032</p>
