<headline>Slovak crown firms after strong fix, seen steady.</headline>

<p>The Slovak crown sharply firmed after the National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) again fixed it stronger than market levels and dealers said the currency looked stable at its current price.</p>
<p>The crown firmed some 110 basis points to around -1.90 percent versus its mark/dollar basket parity at about 1200 GMT. Earlier on Thursday the NBS fixed the crown at 33.313 to the dollar and at 19.544 to the mark, implying a deviation against the baske of -0.67 percent.</p>
<p>The crown was trading at around -3.0 percent versus the basket shortly before the fixing.</p>
<p>"The crown looks more or less stable at current levels, but it has yet to find its real market price," said Oto Mohnansky of Slovenska Sporitelna.</p>
<p>Mohnansky said the future trend, and thus the crown's real price, would be determined by the NBS' further strategy on market's crown liquidity.</p>
<p>Most dealers agreed that much will depend on how the NBS would react in coming days, pointing mainly to the fact that local banking sector was short of crown liquidity ahead of the end of minimum reserves period on Friday.</p>
<p>According to NBS figures, the Slovak banking sector lacked 6.17 percent of required funds to meet its minimum reserves requirement.</p>
<p>"Based on the current situation, some banks just cannot meet their reserve requirement tommorow, so it will depend on whether the central bank will add some liquidity," said one local money market trader.</p>
<p>But another Bratislava-based dealer from a foreign bank warned it would be too early for the NBS to pump crown liquidity to the market.</p>
<p>"They (NBS) still cannot say that the danger of another wave of speculative pressure will not occure, so the central bank should probably wait and keep the market short for some more days," the dealer said.</p>
<p>The central bank has deliberately kept the crown money market short of liquidity to prevent speculators from obtaining funds which could be used for short-selling.</p>
<p>The NBS have not carried out its regular repo tenders over the past few days, including Thursday, which radically squeezed liquidity on the money market, but appeared to have helped prevent stronger speculative pressure on the currency.</p>
