<p>European high sulphur fuel oil barges ended steady on Monday after trading higher earlier in the day in what was seen as a player trying to set a higher trend, while cargoes talked firm after Russian material traded strongly on Friday.</p>
<p>After a Rotterdam-based trader initially bought at $85 a tonne fob ARA, or some $1 over Friday's close, high sulphur barges moved down throughout the day to trade at $84.50, $84 and $83.25 or within Friday's early trading range.</p>
<p>Traders said the initial trade was a failed attempt to set a higher trend for the day.</p>
<p>"I think they just wanted to fix a higher price early in the day, but it did not work as all talk turned lower later to about $83.50/$84," one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said demand was thin.</p>
<p>Rotterdam bunkers lost early gains with little sign of demand, with 380 CST fuel sold for as low as $85 fob after barge prices sagged, and Hamburg bunkers moved in line with Rotterdam.</p>
<p>Some traders said the low level of enquiries partly explained the afternoon weakness in the barge market.</p>
<p>Low sulphur fuel barges were quiet in a steady market at the $95/$97 mark after a deal on Friday at $97 fob for 1,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>High sulphur was talked steady to a shade firmer after two Russian M-100 cracked cargoes went for $82 cif late on Friday. The first cargo was bought by a U.K.-based refiner and the second by a French refiner.</p>
<p>One percent was also quiet with two sellers at $95 after a deal on Friday at $1 lower, but the few buyers on the market were heard at around $93.</p>
