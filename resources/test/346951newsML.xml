<headline>Radisys shares off on SEC request.</headline>
<dateline>LOS ANGELES 1997-01-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares of Radisys Corp fell sharply Friday after the company told analysts the Securities and Exchange Commission had requested documents related to the company's inventory accounting, analysts said.</p>
<p>The company, which makes embedded computer technologies, fell 13-1/8 or 22.8 percent to 44-3/8 in Nasdaq trade.</p>
<p>According to analystys, the company told them about the SEC request during a conference call late Thursday after Radisys had reported its fourth quarter results. A spokesman for Radisys did not return telephone calls.  </p>
<p>According to analysts, the company said it had provided the requested information to the SEC and had not heard back from the agency.</p>
<p>In November, Bruce Taylor, a former vice president of operations sued the company alleging he uncovered a "significant discrepency in the financial records of Radisys" related to the reporting of the company's inventory.</p>
<p>The company responded by saying the lawsuit had no merit and it had not been contacted then by the SEC.</p>
<p>Word of the SEC request overshadowed the company's better than expected fourth quarter profit. On Thursday, Radisys reported a profit of $3.6 million or $0.46 a share for the fourth quarter, topping the First Call consensus of $0.42 a share. In the year ago quarter, Radisys reported a profit of $630,000 or $0.11 a share. Revenues for the quarter rose to $27.5 million from $10.6 million.</p>
