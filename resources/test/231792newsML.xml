<p>Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said there are indications industrial and export growth will likely pick up in the second half of 1996/97 (April-March).</p>
<p>Chidambaram was asked in writing by a member of the upper house of parliament to respond to recent comments by former finance minister Manmohan Singh.</p>
<p>Singh, who was finance minister until former prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao's government was defeated in general elections in April and May, voiced concern last month over a slowdown in export and industrial growth and rising inflation.</p>
<p>Singh had been quoted as telling a private television station in an interview that export growth in the first half of the current financial year had slowed substantially and that inflation was rising. He also said overall growth was modest.</p>
<p>But Chidambaram said in his written response to the lawmaker's question "The cyclical fluctuations in production, exports and prices are part of the dynamics of the development process." Chidambram's response was released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"There are indications that in the second half of the current financial year, industrial and export growths are likely to stabilise and improve," Chidambaram said without elaborating.</p>
<p>Exports during April-September increased 9.91 percent over the same period in 1995. Exports grew 26.37 percent during the same six months in 1995 compared with the same period in 1994.</p>
<p>India's index of industrial production increased by 9.3 percent during the four months from April to July compared to the same period in 1995. The growth rate in April-July 1995 over the same period in 1994 was 12.3 percent.</p>
<p>He said the manufacturing sector, which accounts for 77.4 percent of the industrial production index, registered a growth rate of 11.7 percent in April-July 1996, almost the same as the 11.9 percent rate in April-July 1995.</p>
<p>"But the growth rate of basic goods at four percent in April-July 1996 was below expectation," Chidambaram said.</p>
<p>In an answer to another written question from another member of the upper house, Chidambaram said the slowdown in industrial growth was due to the poor performance of electricity and mining, which recorded growth rates of 2.5 and 1.8 percent, respectively, during April to July.</p>
<p>India's year-on-year inflation rate measured by the wholesale price index stood at 6.61 percent in the week ending November 16. The rate stood at 4.18 percent on June 30.</p>
