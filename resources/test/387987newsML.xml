<p>Thailand's property market is expected to remain sluggish this year due to an economic slowdown and oversupply, especially in the capital Bangkok, real estate firm Jones Lang Wootton said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The continued deterioration of general market conditions over 1996 has resulted in not only problems for some developers and owners but also new opportunities," said Jeremy Stewardson, managing director of JLW (Thailand) Ltd, in the firm's latest report.</p>
<p>"The decline in the average level of take-up is impacting on the financial position of developers."</p>
<p>He said any plans by the Thai government to rescue the real estate market may help increase demand in the medium and long-term.</p>
<p>"However, most of these measures are aimed at the housing market and are therefore unlikely to stimulate significant additional demand for commercial real estate or the residential market in central Bangkok," he said.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Amnuay Viravan has announced a government rescue fund worth up to 70 billion baht ($2.7 billion) that could help cash-strapped property firms to overcome loan problems due to problems in their sector.</p>
<p>Analysts have said that the property sector's troubles had resulted from high domestic prime interest rates which, at over 13 percent, stunted demand and increased developers' financing costs.</p>
<p>JLW (Thailand) Ltd, a unit of the London-based real estate firm Jones Lang Wootton Group, said in its report that in Bangkok's office market, about 600,000 square metres of new space was completed in 1996, raising the total stock of office space to 5.8 million square metres.</p>
<p>It said an additional of 903,000 square metres of new space was expected to come onto the market in 1997. The high level of new supply this year resulted from the delay of many projects scheduled for completion in 1996.</p>
<p>"Across Bangkok in 1998, more than 1.3 million (square metres) of new space is scheduled for completion, of which 1.1 million square metres is under construction. A further 1.7 million (square metres) of supply is scheduled for 1999 and 2000. Only 32 percent of this is under construction," the report said.</p>
<p>The company said it believed many of these projects would be either delayed or abandoned.</p>
<p>In the condominium market, over 6,000 new condominium units were completed in 1996, raising the total stock of existing condominium units to 24,600 units. Only 4,700 units were sold last year, it said.</p>
