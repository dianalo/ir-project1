<p>China, caught in a tide of nationalist sentiment, has called unforgivable the plundering of its archives by foreign powers in the past.</p>
<p>"The criminal activities inflicted by foreign powers on the ancient Chinese civilisation are unforgivable," Xinhua news agency on Friday quoted a Chinese archives expert as saying.</p>
<p>Xinhua stopped short of demanding the return of the archives.</p>
<p>The news agency quoted Xu Yipu, director of the first historical archives of China, as saying many valuable cultural relics had been lost or taken abroad by foreign powers throughout history and many remained in foreign museums.</p>
<p>In 1900, allied forces captured Beijing and plundered all the archives preserved by the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), many of which were still on display in the Congressional Library of the United States, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>As many as 6,000 volumes of Buddhist classics from caves in northwestern Dunhuang, written between the fourth and 11th century, were housed in the British Museum and a further 2,500 were in the National Library of France, it said.</p>
<p>China possessed only 128,000 out of 150,000 pieces of inscribed tortoise shell and animal bone unearthed at the Yin ruins of the Shang dynasty (1766-1122 BC). The rest were taken by foreign powers, the news agency said.</p>
<p>China now possessed more than 170 million volumes of archives, but the figure was only a fraction of the total number of Chinese historical archives, it said.</p>
