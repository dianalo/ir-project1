<p>Cargo's contribution to Air Canada's profitability jumped dramatically in 1995 to a "very significant 32 percent" from nine percent since the sale of its DC-8-73 freighter fleet in March 1994, the airline's European general manager cargo, Desmond Vertannes said.</p>
<p>This has been achieved by cutting costs rather than upping revenues, which are expected to reach C$320 million in 1996, he told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Air Canada is aiming at 1997 cargo revenues of C$362 million reflecting a 12 percent hike in freight capacity as more A340s enter the fleet.</p>
<p>Air Canada's marketing alliance with Lufthansa coupled with growth in trans-border traffic to the U.S. are both helping generate new business, said Vertannes.</p>
<p>"Since Lufthansa is also a competitor in Germany, we've balanced our sales strategy so we're not in conflict with each other," he added.</p>
<p>"By making some schedule changes in 1996 and purchasing cargo capacity on Lufthansa's Montreal service, we've increased our German and Scandinavian traffic."</p>
<p>Air Canada's present concern, he said, is determining what sort of carrier Lufthansa will become in the wake of its current difficulties.</p>
<p>"They have a huge network which we want to piggy-back on," he said.</p>
<p>"It's the only way we can extend our market reach. In return, they want to take advantage of Air Canada operations where they're more cost efficient. A big advantage is that our respective cargo systems -- Lufthansa's Traxon and Air Canada's Totem -- can talk to each other."</p>
<p>In addition, the Montreal-based carrier has introduced bar-coding and scanners in Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver: and there are plans to extend their technology to London in third quarter 1997, said Vertannes.</p>
<p>This will facilitate greater integration with Lufthansa. Air Canada has smaller, self-handling cargo operations in Paris and Frankfurt and will sometimes pursue different cargo alliances from its passenger.</p>
<p>He feels the proposed British Airways Plc, American Airlines alliance -- if approved -- has more implications for the passenger than the cargo markets.</p>
<p>But their control of up to 60 percent of London Heathrow slots also impacts cargo. Similarly, there is an inexorable process of consolidation among the freight forwarders who are "hoovering up" much of the smaller niche agency work and placing it with "selective carriers" to protect their capacity position year-round.</p>
