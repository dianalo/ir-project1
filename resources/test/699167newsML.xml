<p>U.S. seasonally adjusted retail sales rose 1.7 percent in the four weeks of fiscal June versus last month, according to the Lynch, Jones &amp; Ryan Inc Redbook Retail Sales Index.</p>
<p>The index rose 8.2 percent compared with the same month a year ago, the report said.  Adjusted retail sales advanced 8.6 percent in the week ended June 28, compared with the same week a year ago, it said.  </p>
<p>Most retailers reported sales were on-to-above plan in the fourth week of June, said Howard Eilenberg, a retail analyst at Redbook Research.</p>
<p>Eilenberg said retailers cited the summer heat for the weekly increase in sales of seasonal goods, such as air conditioners, fans, pool and beach equipment, and warm weather apparel.</p>
<p>"This should help to clear (inventory) out," said Eilenberg in an interview with Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>"When the quarter is over, the margins will be protected and merchandise would've moved out," he said.</p>
<p>Earlier worries about increased inventories and markdowns have lessened, noted Eilenberg.</p>
<p>"July is a clearance month ... but there won't be panic markdowns. The hot weather arrived just in time," he said.</p>
<p>Regionally, retail sales were relatively robust in the Northeast and West Coast.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Eilenberg said retailers should continue to see strong year-on-year comparisons next month.</p>
<p>"July 1996 was not a good month and so the comparisons will be relatively easy," he added.</p>
<p>There were five weeks in June and month-end figures are expected to be released next Thursday.</p>
