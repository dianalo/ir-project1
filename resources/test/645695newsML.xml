<p>A woman was arrested at Bogota's international airport as she tried to board a flight to Germany after swallowing 2.2 pounds (1 kg) of heroin packed in condoms, police said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Maria Osorio, 49, of Colombia, was taken to a hospital shortly after her arrest on Saturday complaining of severe stomach pains. Police said the heroin was packed in more than 90 condoms which the woman had swallowed and also inserted inside her body.</p>
<p>She told police she had been paid 3 million pesos (about $3,000) to deliver the drugs to Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Besides supplying an estimated 80 percent of the world's cocaine, Colombia is fast developing as a major producer and international supplier of high-grade heroin.</p>
<p>According to a report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration last September Colombia has edged out the countries of southeast Asia's Golden Triangle to become the No. 1 supplier of heroin to the United States.</p>
