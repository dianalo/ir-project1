<p>Sweden's top player Thomas Enqvist won his second tournament in eight days by retaining his Stockholm Open title with a 7-5 6-4 7-6 (7-0) victory over American Todd Martin on Sunday.</p>
<p>Third seed Enqvist, who won the Paris Open last Sunday, defeated second seed Martin in a 128-minute battle by racing through the final set tie-break.</p>
<p>The victory also secured Enqvist, 22, the reserve berth at the ATP Tour World Championship, the world's most lucrative tennis tournament which starts in Hanover on November 19.</p>
<p>ATP spokesman Benito Perez-Barbadillo said Enqvist's triumph put him ahead of South African Wayne Ferreira, a first round loser, for the reserve place in the event which brings together the world's top eight players for a top prize of up to $1.4 million.</p>
<p>Just attending as reserve is worth 40,000 dollars, but Enqvist said going as reserve was not the same as being one of the top eight.</p>
<p>"This time it is a little bit different because I am not earning my place," said Enqvist who got through to the semifinals at last year's ATP Tour World Championship.</p>
<p>"It does not feel the same as it did last year."</p>
<p>Enqvist, who also won in Delhi earlier this year, will lead his country against France in the Davis Cup in Malmo late this month.</p>
<p>Martin, 26, aced Enqvist 21 times in the match and was aced 14 times in return.</p>
<p>Enqvist, already hailed as the successor to Stefan Edberg who is retiring this year, gained the first break of serve in the third game.</p>
<p>The fifth game went through nine deuces before Enqvist took it, then Martin broke back in the 10th game to square the set before the Swede broke him immediately and held serve for the set.</p>
<p>By the time Enqvist won the second set after two breaks of serve, the crowd's cheering and footstamping in support of Enqvist was visibly irritating Martin.</p>
<p>"That's too good. Martin against Stockholm," snapped the American.</p>
<p>They played in equal terms to 6-6 in the third set before Enqvist sealed his victory in the tiebreak.</p>
<p>The win capped a season which for Enqvist began indifferently but ended on a high.</p>
<p>"I moved really well on the court and that is the big key to beating Martin," Enqvist said. "I played well and I think he didn't play his best. He can play better than this."</p>
