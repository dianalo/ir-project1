<p>A red-faced European Commission slipped up on Wednesday and said publicly what many of its officials have been saying in private -- that no new country was likely to join the European Union before 2002.</p>
<p>In a 30-point fact sheet on the 15-nation bloc's expansion plans the EU executive said that, because of the complicated nature of the process, "the earliest realistic date for the first accessions is likely to be no earlier than 2002."</p>
<p>It later backtracked, saying the fact sheet did not represent the official stance of the EU executive.</p>
<p>"It was an erroneous version which contains...a regrettable contradiction with the official position of the Commission as to the probable date of the first accession by the new member states," the Commission said in a statement.</p>
<p>The correction showed how sensitive the issue is at a time when some eastern European countries -- led by Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary -- are battering down the door to come in.</p>
<p>The slip was even more unfortuntate in light of Franco-German eagerness to see the EU embrace some former Iron Curtain countries at the millennium.</p>
<p>At a seminar on Tuesday on the EU and NATO's separate enlargement plans External Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek said he was not allowed to talk about timing.</p>
<p>But somehow the timing went by mistake into the fact sheet made available to reporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Commission said that its official position was that the first expansion of the EU should take place "as soon as possible" and that it could not give a date because this depended on several factors.</p>
<p>Among those are progress in the EU's intergovernmental review of its workings and on exactly how prepared individual countries are to join.</p>
<p>Only recently French President Jacques Chirac told Hungary he saw no reason why it and other central European neighbours could not join by 2000.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary -- the most economically advanced applicants -- hung on every word recently as Chirac and French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said a target date of 2000 was achievable if there was "political will".</p>
<p>Chirac, trying to overturn the east's vision of France as opposed to their integration into Western institutions, is championing EU enlargement into former communist Europe.</p>
<p>He counts on the backing of France's ally of modern times, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.</p>
<p>As the shining economic stars of the former communist bloc, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have lobbied hard to get in on their own merits and not wait for struggling countries like Bulgaria and Romania to catch up.</p>
<p>The three Baltic States -- Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania -- have also applied, along with Slovenia and Slovakia.</p>
<p>Warsaw, Prague and Budapest are also seen as favourites to be invited for a first wave of separate expansion talks at NATO at an alliance summit set for July 8-9 in Madrid.</p>
<p>Alliance sources said on Wednesday that Slovenia was emerging as the best placed outsider.</p>
<p>Romania was likely to be left out of NATO's first expansion, despite heavy lobbying by France, they said.  The EU is also due to start talks with Cyprus while Malta's application to join has been put on hold.</p>
