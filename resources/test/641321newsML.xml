<p>European economic and monetary union (EMU) will bring increased competition and consolidation in asset management in Europe as new markets open and greater economies of scale are forced.</p>
<p>"The war has already started, the regrouping is in process," Alain Leclair, vice chairman of Paribas Asset Management told Reuters Thursday.</p>
<p>In a speech at the annual European Asset Management Conference he described how EMU will bring more cross-border competition for institutional and retail market share, favouring large, well capitalised players and forcing smaller ones to make difficult choices.</p>
<p>"It has become big industrial-type companies which manage money," he said.</p>
<p>Asset managers are called upon, Leclair said, to make increasingly large investments in systems, engineering and investment talent.</p>
<p>This investment will be hard for local players to make, post-EMU, as they face more competition on home markets from international firms.</p>
<p>"We will have much bigger asset managers," Leclair said. "More financial institutions will decide that they cannot invest in both the factory and the distribution. They will invest in good service for their clients. An increasing divide will arise between asset managers and distributors."</p>
<p>Smaller European asset managers will decide, he said, to contract out investment advisory and back office services to the largest players, and to serve as fund gathering conduits.</p>
<p>There is already evidence of an easing of the grip that European financial institutions have on their home markets, according to Mark Tennant, managing director at Chase Investment Bank.</p>
<p>"In Germany, the banks are losing market share. Only five years ago they had 90 percent of distribution, now it is down to 85 percent."</p>
<p>Leclair also called for the establishment of more trans- European pension products which can be taken by employees as they move within EMU member nations.</p>
<p>"We want one tool that could be chosen by a corporation or employee that can be a European tool, for use in all countries."</p>
