<p>United Nations Security Council members are scheduled to meet Tuesday to draft a resolution to allow a renewal of the "oil-for-food" deal for Iraq, U.N. sources said.</p>
<p>The meeting, at the "expert" level, comes ahead of a scheduled informal discussion by the Security Council on Wednesday when the Council might vote to adopt a new resolution to extend the deal for another six months, the source said.</p>
<p>"The indications are that it will get the go-ahead this week. It might be adopted tomorrow if everyone is in agreement, it depends if anyone wants to take it back to their capitals...There is a formal meeting (of the Security Council) tentatively scheduled for Friday," the source said.</p>
<p>A draft of U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's report, obtained by Reuters on Monday, called for a renewal of the accord on existing terms, as had been widely expected.</p>
<p>The current deal allows Iraq to sell $2 billion of oil (plus $140 million to cover Turkish pipeline charges) over 180 days and use most of the proceeds to pay for food, medicine and other approved humanitarian goods. It is an exception to broad sanctions in place since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The current deal expires on Saturday, June 7th.</p>
<p>In Washington, sources familiar with the Clinton Administration's thinking said on Monday that a decision had already been taken to okay a renewal of the deal.</p>
<p>The U.S. has held up the deal at various stages since discussions began in early 1996 and had been the only Security Council member to reserve its decision on renewal.</p>
<p>Annan, in his draft report, complained of delays in processing applications for humanitarian goods, most of which have been held up by the U.S.</p>
<p>"It would be good to have the deal renewed before it expires on the 7th. The U.S. could hold things up but they've been thinking about this for a long time," said a Western diplomat at the U.N.</p>
<p>U.N. Security Council members formally received a copy Annan's report on Tuesday morning, diplomats said.</p>
