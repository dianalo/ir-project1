<p>WIK MEETING UNDERWAY</p>
<p>In Canberra, State and Territory leaders have gone into a meeting with the Prime Minister about native title still divided about how to resolve problems raised by the High Court's Wik decision.</p>
<p>Mr Howard believes his ten-point plan is the most fair and practical way to resolve the impasse over native title on pastoral leases.</p>
<p>But the plan hasn't won support from all the States, and some Premiers say there is unlikely to be a resolution from today's meeting.</p>

<p>RUNDLE CALLS FOR CONTINUED VIGILANCE ON GUN CONTROL</p>
<p>Tasmania's Premier, Tony Rundle, has called for continued vigilance on gun control.</p>
<p>Today is the first anniversary of the Port Arthur massacre in which 35 people were shot dead by lone gunman, Martin Bryant. Mr Rundle says it would be a tragedy to reverse the decision to tighten gun laws, and says the passing of this anniversary shouldn't see any relaxation in those efforts.</p>
<p>The Premier says the establishment of national fire-arms reforms was a remarkable achievement, and it must be ensured there's no political platform for the reversal of those laws.</p>

<p>MEMORIAL TO BE BEAMED AROUND THE GLOBE</p>
<p>In Tasmania, mourners are gathering at Port Arthur for the first anniversary memorial service for the victims of the tragic massacre.</p>
<p>Thirty-five people died after being shot by Martin Bryant at the historic site a year ago today.</p>
<p>Seating for 300 has been provided in the ruins of the old convict church, with an audio backdrop of the soundtrack from the movie, Schindler's List.</p>
<p>A large media contingent is at the site to record the service which will be beamed around the world.</p>

<p>HEARING DELAYED AFTER ELEVATOR AND HEALTH PROBLEMS</p>
<p>The committal hearing of two men, charged in connection with the bashing death of a British tourist at Sydney's Bondi Beach last year, has been delayed for about two-hours.</p>
<p>Twenty-eight-year-old Brian Hagland died while walking home with his girlfriend near Bondi Beach last September.</p>
<p>Twenty-three year old Aaron Martin has been charged with murder, while another 23-year-old man, Sean Cushman, has been charged with accessory after the fact of murder.</p>
<p>The start of the hearing at Sydney's Darling Centre Local Court has been delayed until this afternoon, after Mr Martin and his barrister got stuck in a court lift and his mother later collapsed.</p>

<p>COMPETITION FOR GOVERNMENT LEGAL ADVISER</p>
<p>The Federal Government's internal legal adviser, the Attorney General's Legal Practice, is to be opened up to competition from July next year.</p>
<p>Attorney General Daryl Williams says the Legal Practice which is largely based in Canberra, will be restructured as a statutory organisation, known as the Australian Government Solicitor, but remain under his direction.</p>
<p>Under the reforms the organisation will continue to meet the Commonwealth's legal needs, but government departments will have greater freedom to appoint their own lawyers.</p>
<p>Mr Williams says the increased competition will allow the government to make further savings in legal costs.</p>

<p>DEMOCRATS ATTACK EFFORTS TO CIRCUMVENT ANDREWS LAW</p>
<p>The Territory branch of the Australian Democrats has attacked efforts to circumvent the Andrews anti voluntary euthanasia law.</p>
<p>Labor's John Bailey last week introduced a private members bill to the Territory parliament making an offence of euthanasia, with minimal penalties.</p>
<p>The Australian Democrats are collecting a petition for a referendum in all states and Territories on voluntary euthanasia, to highlight public opinion.</p>
<p>Territory spokesman Vick Edwards says Mr Bailey is going the wrong way about it.</p>

<p>AWU THREATENS ACTION IF MASSIVE CUT MEANS JOB LOSSES</p>
<p>The Australian Workers Union says the two-thousand possible job losses forced by the partial closure of BHP's Newcastle steel mill could force national industrial action.</p>
<p>The union's Newcastle secretary, Maurie Rudd, says members are expecting a statement from management on the mill's future tomorrow.</p>
<p>Mr Rudd told ABC radio, BHP's likely to announce the closure, rather than updating of the mill's blast furnaces and coke ovens.</p>
<p>He says he believes BHP is planning to get out of steel in Australia.</p>
