<p>The Philippine bellwether 91-day Treasury bill rate dropped to an average of 10.625 percent during the regular weekly auction from 10.661 percent last week, the Bureau of Treasury said on Monday.  </p>
<p>The other maturities likewise fell. The 182-day T-bill rate slipped to an average of 10.986 percent from 11.073; and the 364-day rate dipped to 11.491 from 11.532 percent.,</p>
<p>A foreign bank dealer said the government fetched lower rates on its T-bill rates because of its improved credit rating.</p>
<p>Last Friday, the U.S.-based Standard and Poor's Corp upgraded the Philippines' peso-denominated debt to A-minus/A-1 from BBB-plus/A-3 respectively. Its long-term foreign currency debt was also raised to BB-plus from BB.</p>
<p>"Investors from abroad are looking at the Philippines as a better investment opportunity," the dealer said.  </p>
<p>Traders said the continued high liquidity in the market was also a factor in nudging rates lower.</p>
<p>The auction had 20.350 billion pesos worth of tenders, of which 4.5 billion pesos were accepted.</p>
<p>The one-year bills attracted the most number of bids at 7.650 billion pesos, of which two billion pesos were awarded.</p>
<p>The 182-day bills, which had sales of 1.5 billion pesos, generated 6.920 billion pesos of bids.</p>
<p>And the 91-day bill drew 5.780 billion pesos of tenders, of which one billion pesos were awarded.</p>
