<p>U.S. cattle should be priced individually instead of by the pen to cut down on variation in beef quality and entice consumers, said Kevin Bost, commodities analyst at Topco Associates Inc.</p>
<p>"To the extent that the consumer has to gamble on the taste of the product, demand for beef is reduced," Bost said in a speech prepared for delivery on Tuesday at the U.S. Agriculture Department's annual Agricultural Outlook Forum.</p>
<p>He said the marketing systems for poultry and pork were better geared toward consumer demands.</p>
<p>"In order for the beef industry to deliver the product that consumers want, cattle must be priced individually, and there will have to be more price discrimination between carcasses, based on characteristics that are important to consumers -- meat quality, and cut-ability, appearance, and uniformity, among others," Bost said.</p>
