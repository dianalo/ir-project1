<p>President Boris Yeltsin expressed confidence in the pro-reform Russian government he formed in March during a meeting on Monday with First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, Russian media reported.</p>
<p>"I am happy with your many draft decrees and resolutions. They are fresh and not at all like earlier ones," Interfax news agency quoted Yeltsin as telling Chubais, who oversees Russian economic policymaking and is in temporary charge of the cabinet while Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin takes a holiday.</p>
<p>Saying the previous cabinet had stagnated, Yeltsin said the new team -- in which young reformer Boris Nemtsov is the other first deputy premier -- had "positively affected the style, methods and results" of the government's work.</p>
<p>But Yeltsin stressed the need for results in a country still suffering from a deep economic depression with many workers receiving salaries months behind schedule.</p>
<p>"Now already we need to think about results, how to fulfil everything that's been planned," Yeltsin said.</p>
<p>He said the most pressing short-term goal was paying off back wages and pensions. "The main thing now is to fulfil our promises on repaying pensions by July 1," he said as the meeting started in front of reporters.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 66, who returned to active work in February after eight months of illness, formed an effectively new government under the veteran Chernomyrdin shortly afterwards and entrusted it with reviving market reforms.</p>
<p>Chubais and Nemtsov are the driving force in the new government and, with full presidential support, appear to have a free hand, at least for now.</p>
<p>Nemtsov embodied the new government's vigour on Monday during a trip to Tokyo in which he appealed for more Japanese investment in Russia, particularly in energy-related projects.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's endorsement of the government's moves came as it faces another possible confrontation with a parliament dominated by communists and nationalists.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the State Duma lower house of parliament is due to review the government's request to cut spending on the 1997 budget since tax revenue has fallen far short of target.</p>
<p>The topic was among issues discussed by Yeltsin and Chubais, the Kremlin said in a statement.</p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, Economy Minister Yakov Urinson on Monday said Russian companies in every sector were showing signs of growth, and forecast the economy would grow next year.</p>
<p>"We need to get rid of the ballast in every sector more quickly, and then we really will reach two percent growth in GDP (gross domestic product) in 1998 and five percent in the year 2000," Urinson told Ekho Moskvy radio.</p>
<p>Yeltsin also met Defence Minister Igor Sergeyev, who said the military leadership was taking all steps necessary to carry out the dramatic reforms of the ailing Russian forces sought by Yeltsin, the Kremlin said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin appointed Sergeyev last month after sacking his predecessor for failing to proceed fast enough with reforms.</p>
<p>Sergeyev later told Interfax that planned changes included cutting costs by streamlining the civilian administration of the forces, ending duplication of tasks, and selling off or better utilising assets and properties.</p>
<p>In a day packed with meetings, Yeltsin also met the head of the border guard service, Andrei Nikolayev, and the speaker of the regional parliament in Dagestan, and talked by telephone to the mayor of the Siberian city of Chelyabinsk.</p>
