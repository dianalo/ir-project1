<p>Mexico's former Finance Minister Jaime Serra Puche, refusing to talk to reporters about any topic other than global trade, decried disguised protectionism Tuesday as one of three main problems that world trade is suffering.</p>
<p>Speaking here at the Latin American Steel Congress, now without his hallmark moustache and as a professor at Princeton University, Serra Puche said countries that use labour and environmental causes to block trade sometimes do so to protect domestic industries.  </p>
<p>"There are legitimate worries (on labour and environmental issues), but these can be converted into a form of protectionism," Serra Puche said, adding misuse of such measures could become a serious problem that worsens trade relations rather than helps the situation. He pointed no finger of blame at any countries in particular.</p>
<p>Serra Puche added the two other main obstacles to world trade were ambiguous and different investment rules in countries and the regionalisation of the globe, with countries turning to trade blocs.  </p>
<p>He said trading blocks were automatically setting up trade preferences without taking into account costs and efficiencies of nations and said such trading alliances had evolved into forms of trade discrimination.</p>
<p>"I reiterate, granting preferential trade nation status, also grants discrimination," he said, again not mentioning countries.  </p>
<p>On international investment, he called for the World Trade Organisation to take a lead in this area and establish a non- obligatory code of investment to avoid a syndrome he dubbed "boardroom confusion," where companies opted for safe investment plans at home or in developed markets because of the unclear rules in developing nations.</p>
<p>"To avoid a new surge of protectionism, the World Trade Organisation must show leadership that harmonises regional accords in free trade, that promotes multilateral rules for investment and that finds mechanisms for cooperation (not sanctions) to look after legitimate preoccupations on the environment and labour," he concluded.</p>
