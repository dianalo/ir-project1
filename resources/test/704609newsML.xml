<p>Leading Russian shares pushed towards closing records in busy late afternoon trading on Thursday, but traders said a national holiday in the U.S. on Friday would test the Russian market's mettle.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System 22-share index hit a record 465.68 at 1000 GMT after Wednesday's record 447.94 closing.</p>
<p>"The market is doing pretty well, even better than we expected and than most of our clients expected," said Rossiisky Kredit Bank trader Oleg Martynenko who saw the market closing at a record by the end of the trading session.</p>
<p>National power company UES  was trading at $0.4440 at 1424 GMT, off a morning high of $0.4650 but still almost 10 percent over its Wednesday close of $0.4055.</p>
<p>Many traders expect some correction in the market which has risen strongly in the last three days but new funds are still flowing from the West.</p>
<p>UES said on Thursday it would start a convertible bond programme covering 2.7 percent of shares by the autumn, and would issue regulation 144-A American Depositary Receipts on shares this summer.</p>
<p>Russian news agency quoted it as saying it was considering a merger with Siberia-based Irkutskenergo.</p>
<p>Traders said the market took the news favourably overall and several other stocks also saw higher levels. Regional utility Mosenergo rose to $1.555 from $1.450 and oil company LUKoil  rose to $22.500 from $21.100.</p>
<p>But CS First Boston chief trader Igor Rozhkov said buyers were already appearing, although the market remained strong.</p>
<p>"So far there is still money but levels are pretty high and already buyers have appeared," Rozhkov said, noting UES's slip from its early $0.4650 high. "It's a very volatile market."</p>
<p>And Martynenko said the market's stamina would be proved as the U.S. took off on Friday for the independence day holiday.</p>
<p>"I think tomorrow is a very important day: the U.S.A. will be closed, and it will be become clear whether Russia can keep the positions alone," Martynenko said. "Tomorrow and Monday will be decisive."</p>
