<p>Roadshows for the $50 million convertible bond issue from Polish steelmaker Stalexport SA will start at the end of the first quarter of 1997, lead manager Robert Fleming said.</p>
<p>"The issue will have a maturity of five- to seven years and will be listed in London," said a spokesman for the lead manager.</p>
<p>He added that Stalexport, Poland's largest steelmaker, was raising the cash because it wanted to become a fully integrated steelmaker.</p>
<p>The issue was keenly fought over among lead managers and Flemings, which said it is the largest manager of convertible bond issues out of Asia, won over stiff competition.</p>
<p>"We are making a determined push in Eastern Europe," said the Flemings spokesman. -- David Chance London newsroom 44 171 542 5887</p>
