<p>Belgian OLOs edged up slightly in a tightly traded session on Friday, fractionally lagging Bunds and looking ahead to Monday's monthly auction where the new March 2007 OLO will be on offer with the June 2001 bond.</p>
<p>The market is also considering the possibility of a rise in U.S. short term rates at next Tuesday's meeting of the policy- making Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). A small majority of economists polled by Reuters said they were expecting a rise.</p>
<p>"I see a 25 basis point rate hike - that has been discounted by the market," one dealer said. For many, no rate rise this time would simply mean it was being delayed to the next meeting.  </p>
<p>By 1450 GMT the 2006 OLO was yielding 6.36 percent compared to 6.38 percent at the previous close, its spread over equivalent German paper widening one basis point to 22 bp.</p>
<p>The new March 2007 OLO, trading on the grey market on a "when issued" basis, was still yielding just five basis points over the current ten-year OLO which it is expected to replace as benchmark in January.</p>
<p>Dealers considered the new bond expensive, but expected it to stay around these levels for several weeks due to lack of supply and the fact domestic players wanted it on their books.  </p>
<p>In the money market T-bills were yielding 3.04/06 percent, unchanged from the previous close.</p>
<p>The franc firmed fractionally to 20.5830/40 from 20.5850/70 late Thursday.</p>
