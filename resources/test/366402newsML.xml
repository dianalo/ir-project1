<headline>Late LME copper touch firmer, aluminium edges down.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-02-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Copper edged up from the bottom end of its recent trading range in late trading on Monday, while aluminium extended earlier losses.</p>
<p>By 1900 GMT three months delivery was at $2,235 per tonne, up $4 from its LME kerb close of $2,231 and just $4 down from Friday.</p>
<p>By the close the cash/threes premium was easier at around $180 versus Friday's $220.</p>
<p>Copper had dipped early in the day but support in the $2,220 area held and prices bounced smartly.</p>
<p>LME stocks were expected to rise by some 10,000 tonnes, after Friday's increase of 15,325 tonnes.</p>
<p>Aluminium, which broke through $1,600 support amid fund liquidation earlier in the day, drifted down $5 from the kerb close to end at $1,580 per tonne, a decline of $23 from Friday.</p>
<p>"In the short term we expect further tests of underlying support, as the technical indicators continue to ease out the past month's overbought conditions. The next level of support is placed at $1,575-61," said analyst Martin Squires of Rudolf Wolff.</p>
