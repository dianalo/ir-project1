<p>A 5.2-percent shareholder of paintmaker Polifarb Wroclaw has sent a letter to the Polish Securities Commission protesting the terms of the firm's planned merger with Polifarb Cieszyn.</p>
<p>James Juracka of Credit Suisse Asset Management, which manages the London-listed Central European Growth Fund, said he wrote a letter for the fund and other U.S. and U.K. Wroclaw shareholders, asking the commission to prevent Cieszyn's version of the merger.</p>
<p>Cieszyn shareholders on Monday approved a version of the merger giving them 53.5 rather than 50 percent of the new firm by increasing a planned pre-merger bonus issue for Cieszyn shareholders to 6.375 from 2.98 million shares.</p>
<p>"We want the merger to take place...that's not the issue, the issue is preventing a six-million-share bonus issue of Cieszyn until there could be an informed discussion between the two firms' shareholders," Juracka said.</p>
<p>In December last year the two firms agreed on a one-for-one merger but Pioneer First Polish Trust Fund Co, which has a bigger share in Cieszyn than Wroclaw, proposed the greater bonus issue a few days before Cieszyn's meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>Wroclaw currently has 22,103,820 shares, 2,978,820 more than Cieszyn.</p>
<p>Juracka said the new proposal came late enough after the original December plan to prevent Wroclaw shareholders opposing Cieszyn's version to set up a proper voting bloc at the Tuesday Wroclaw meeting.</p>
<p>He said then only 100,000 other shares joined his fund with over a million shares against the merger plan's late changes.</p>
<p>"I think most Wroclaw shareholders are now realising that what actually happened is not what they thought was going to happen....(that) they would get 50-50 in the merged concern," Juracka said.</p>
<p>Wroclaw officials have said a mutual shareholder, BIG, might dispute Cieszyn's action in court but that the merger was still likely to go through as a delay would cost both firms.</p>
<p>Pioneer spokesman Miroslaw Lubon told Reuters on Thursday that it was hard to speculate on a letter which his firm had not seen but that Pioneer kept its view that Cieszyn was higher valued due to a higher mid-term earnings potential.</p>
<p>"It seems that everything shows that the proportion (of the merger) should be as we proposed it," Lubon said.</p>
<p>No one at the securities commission was immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Juracka said there were arguments for each firm to receive a greater amount of the new firm, such as Wroclaw's higher margins and Cieszyn's higher investment, but that each side's arguments tended to cancel the other's out.</p>
