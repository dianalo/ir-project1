<p>Israeli shares closed lower in dull trading on Wednesday with investors showing little interest in the market because of the deadlock between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares fell 0.64 percent, or 1.40 points, to 185.44 on low turnover of 40 million shekels against 49 million on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index lost 0.84 percent to 195.18.</p>
<p>"Nothing is happening in the market and investors are showing no interest in it. We have not seen such low turnover for years," said Ronen Kaufman at Y.L.R. Capital Markets.</p>
<p>"There is no new money coming in," said Eran Goren, managing director of Zannex Securities. "Foreign investors prefer investing in other emerging markets right now because of the political uncertainty here."</p>
<p>"The future of the market depends on a breakthrough in the peace talks with the Palestinians and the (cabinet's) approval of the budget. The redeployment of Israeli army in Hebron would be the first step towards a recovery of the market," Goren said.</p>
<p>Israel agreed more than a year ago to hand over most of Hebron to Palestinian self-rule. The pullout has become a major issue in talks between Israelis and Palestinians following recent clashes that killed 74 people.</p>
<p>The Treasury is due to present the 1997 budget to the cabinet on October 29.</p>
<p>Israel's Plasson Ltd has decided not to proceed for the time being with its placing of shares on the London Stock Exchange, its sponsors Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull Securities said in a statement.</p>
<p>The kibbutz company is a leading maker of plastic connectors and was the first Israeli concern to seek a full listing on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The most active shares were Koor Industries, which fell 1.50 percent to 27,671 on volume of three million shekels; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which gained 0.75 percent to 141,341 on volume of three million shekels; and IDB Holdings, which fell 1.50 percent to 1,073.</p>
