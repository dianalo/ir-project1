<p>Villeurbanne, led by American Delaney Rudd, shocked Pau-Orthez 97-95 in a thrilling all-French opener to the second phase of the men's basketball EuroLeague on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Rudd was the undisputed hero, scoring 27 points, including a three-point shot with one minute left as Villeurbanne were trailing their hosts by three points at 95-92.</p>
<p>On the counter-attack, Pau's star skipper Antoine Rigaudeau, back in action after an elbow injury, missed an easy chance, allowing Rudd to make a decisive pass to Jim Bilba, who smashed in the winner with five seconds left in the match.</p>
<p>The loss was all the more unwelcome for Pau as it was their fourth in succession in the competition.</p>
<p>Villeurbanne, on the other hand, maintained their unexpectedly high profile in group G after scoring huge upsets in the first phase against holders Panathinaikos and Barcelona.</p>
<p>The team from the suburbs of Lyon struggled at first, twice trailing by 15 points, but Pau-Orthez were hampered by the poor form of Rigaudeau, who had to wait for 38 minutes to score.</p>
<p>It was much too late as Villeurbanne, far more mobile than their opponents in the second half, had levelled at 85-85 with four minutes left.</p>
