<p>The International Finance Corp (IFC) said on Monday it arranged an unrated 10 billion yen, five-year Euro-yen offering for Thailand's Phatra Thanakit Plc with IBJ Asia Ltd as joint lead manager.</p>
<p>The issue represents the longest maturity financing obtained by any Thai finance company from the international bond markets, the World Bank's IFC said in a statement obtained by Reuters.</p>
<p>"This transaction would strengthen Phatra Thanakit by imparting stability to its funding base, thereby helping in the reduction of asset liability mismatches and enabling it to on-lend a part of the proceeds to its private sector clients for longer tenors than has been possible until now, "it said.</p>
<p>Phatra Thanakit said in October that it planned to make this issue.</p>
