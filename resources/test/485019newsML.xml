<p>India's political crisis will hit a keenly-awaited $350 million issue of global equity by the country's largest refiner, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), as crucial reforms are put on hold, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The Indian government will need to address two key issues before IOC can tap the GDR market -- settlement of oil pool dues and a reforms agenda for the downstream oil industry," said analyst Avadhoot Sabnis at securities firm James Capel B&amp;K.</p>
<p>"Given the current political scenario, no action is likely in the immediate future, and the GDR looks delayed until the third quarter of 1997/98," Sabnis said in a note to investors.</p>
<p>India was plunged into political chaos on Sunday when the Congress party withdrew crucial support for the ruling coalition.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, who heads the 10-month-old United Front government, is due to face a vote of confidence in parliament on April 11.</p>
<p>"The government is not taking a decision on the price hike. Unless you do that you cannot launch the issue," said Jaspal Bindra, head of corporate finance at UBS Securities.</p>
<p>Analysts say an oil price hike is unavoidable to reduce the oil pool deficit, a subsidy the government pays oil firms to compensate them for selling oil in the domestic market below global prices.</p>
<p>The oil pool deficit is currently estimated to total around 158 billion rupees ($4.4 billion).</p>
<p>Analysts said IOC's issue -- which was due to be launched soon after last month's jumbo offering by the state-run Videsh Sanchar Nigam Ltd -- would be the only significant casualty of the government's ambitious divestment plan.</p>
<p>"If things settle down and the budget gets passed I don't see the divestment programme taking a hit," Bindra said.</p>
<p>"It all depends on how quickly the political crisis gets resolved. The only one to suffer immediately will be IOC."</p>
<p>India plans to raise $1.3 billion in 1997/98 (April-March) by selling shares in state-run firms including IOC, Gas Authority of India, Modern Food Industries and India Tourism Development Corporation.</p>
<p>"From a policy perspective, the one near-term issue which will be affected is that the petroleum price hike will be delayed," said Arup Raha, senior economist at U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Raha said it was unlikely that the country's economic reforms programme which marked India's gradual conversion to a free-market economy would be affected.</p>
<p>"The current situation is more of a conflict between personalities rather than policies," he said.</p>
<p>"If you take a step back and look at the overall picture, regardless of which party comes to power, the economic agenda is set."</p>
