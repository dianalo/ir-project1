<p>Failure by Albania to hold early elections to restore stability would be suicidal for the turbulent Balkan state, Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I think not having elections and not having them in the best way possible is an act of collective suicide," Pangalos said as he ended a one-day visit to Albania to consult with political leaders.</p>
<p>"This is the total destruction of Albania for many years," he told a news conference. "Enough harm has been done and there must be force in this nation to overcome."</p>
<p>Pangalos, who also visited Greek troops serving with the 6,000-strong multinational force sent to Albania after March riots tore apart the country, said it was in Greece's interest to have its neighbour return to stability.</p>
<p>He noted that Greece was the only member of the European Union to share a land border with Albania. Hundreds of thousands of Albanians live and work in Greece.</p>
<p>"So what is happening here is not only of interest for foreign policy for us but something that influences the stability and the economy of Greece," he said.</p>
<p>Based upon his talks with Albanian political leaders, Pangalos said it appeared all parties wanted to participate in the June 29 elections, although some are worried about the potential for fraud which has marred previous Albanian polls.</p>
<p>"I can assure you that no party we met with told me they don't want to participate. Some of them have proposals and copnditions...but nobody wanted to abstain."</p>
<p>He said he did not think the bombing on Monday of a cafe in Tirana frequented by members of the Socialist Party, the main rival to President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party, could have been the work of any responsible political grouping. No one was killed in the bombing but 20 people were injured.</p>
<p>"I can with great difficulty imagine that any responsible political organisation would be associated with this act," he said.</p>
<p>Pangalos said the political parties and Berisha "welcome extensive monitoring of the elections", and Greece would provide "the largest possible number of observers".</p>
<p>Pangalos said the Italian-led multinational force should "make its presence evident" on election day, although it would not be feasible for it to guard all 4,000 voting stations in the country.</p>
<p>A European Parliament mission visiting Albania at the same time urged political parties to take part in the elections.</p>
<p>"We hope the all political parties will participate in the elections, which we consider as the only way to help Albanians overcome the crisis," said Doris Pack of the European People's Party.</p>
<p>Pack said the European Parliament would have a minor role in monitoring elections but said the EU wanted to provide economic assistance after the vote.</p>
<p>"We are here to tell Albanians we will help them and our role will increase after the elections," she said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Bashkim Fino told Pangalos that Monday's cafe bombing was a terrorist act damaging to the electoral process, and asked for more multinational troops.</p>
<p>"Yesterday's terrorist acts are a clear proof of the political climate the elections are being held in, and everything should be done to assist the Albanian police, which is still unorganised after the last crisis in Albania," Fino said.</p>
<p>Albania has been in a state of near-anarchy since riots erupted in March after thousands of people lost their savings in shady pyramid investment schemes.</p>
<p>People blamed Berisha and his Democratic Party-led government. Under Western pressure, Berisha agreed to form a multi-party government and hold early elections.</p>
