<p>Continental Airlines, which this week annouced new daily routes to Brazil, expects Latin American sales to top $1 billion over the next five years, a senior company official said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ralph Schulz, Continental Airlines vice-president for Latin America marketing and sales said Latin America currently accounts for just 5 percent of the company's $7 billion in annual revenue. However he said the growth potential was huge.</p>
<p>"This is the market where we can grow at double digits a year," Schulz said in an interview.</p>
<p>Continental hopes to almost triple its Latin American revenue by launching an aggressive expansion plan which will focus primarily on South America, Schulz said.</p>
<p>He said the Latin American market had boomed since the beginning of the decade following the successful implementation of free market anti-inflation plans in several of the major economies.</p>
<p>Schulz said the South American routes should account for up to $400 million of the annual $1 billion in sales revenue the company hopes to generate over the next three to five years.</p>
<p>This week Continental announced that as of July it would begin offering flights between Newark International Airport in New Jersey and the Brazilian cities of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>Schulz said sales in Brazil, the largest Latin American market, were expected to grow at an annual rate of 20 percent for the next three years.</p>
<p>"Brazil accounts for 50 percent of the South American market," he added.</p>
<p>Moreover, Continental is also plans to begin flying to Chile and Argentina in a year, he said.</p>
<p>Schulz said Continental is currently vying with its U.S. competitor American Airlines for a controlling stake in the troubled Argentine carrier Aerolineas Argentinas.</p>
<p>"We do not usually make this kind of investment but Aerolineas is a very good opportunity for us to enter Argentina," Schulz said.</p>
<p>Continental is also in negotiations with the Chilean government to offer flights from Santiago to Newark by the end of this year, he said.</p>
<p>Continental, which already flies to Europe, Asia and the South Pacific, is just the latest U.S. carrier to announce plans to fly to Brazil.</p>
<p>Last week, Delta Air Lines Inc. announced it would begin to offer South American routes beginning with daily flights between Rio and Sao Paulo in Brazil and Cincinnati and Atlanta in the United States. Currently, only American Airlines and United Airlines offer services to Brazil.</p>
