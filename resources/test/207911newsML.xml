<p>French sugar intervention board FIRS on Thursday it revised upwards its estimate for the 1996/97 beet sugar crop to 4.1 million tonnes from last month's 4.05 million target.</p>
<p>In its November report FIRS also said that if harvest conditions remained favourable, final output may be near the 4.199 million tonnes produced in 1995/96.</p>
<p>"If harvest conditions remain good, the impact of a drought in July and August on sugar yield may be wiped out. Production in 1996/97 would thus be close to the 4.199 million tonnes reached in 1995/96," FIRS said.  </p>
<p>The 4.1 million tonnes crop estimate assumes a sugar yield of 9.72 tonnes per hectare against 9.60 tonnes targeted last month and 9.77 tonnes reached last season.</p>
<p>FIRS linked the upward revision to a sharp rise in sugar content.</p>
<p>"Beet weight per hectare remains below that of past years but sugar content is sharply higher in almost all regions," it said. --Paris newsroom +331 4221 5432</p>
