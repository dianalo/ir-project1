<p>Some 5,500 workers at two plants of Turkey's largely state-owned petrochemicals producer Petkim stopped a protest on Thursday after they were given assurances over their pay demands, its general manager Mehmet Yilmaz said.</p>
<p>"We have given them assurances and they stopped the protest at 3 p.m. (1300 GMT)," Yilmaz told Reuters.</p>
<p>About 3,300 workers at Aliaga and 2,200 others at Izmit plants of Petkim had staged a sit-in and stopped goods despatches since Monday, the second action of its kind this month over demands of higher wages.</p>
<p>"After I assured them, they resumed work," Yilmaz said.</p>
<p>He said the workers' demands would be considered at the next collective bargaining talks with the trade union.</p>
<p>The trade union has demanded that the workers' salaries be raised in tandem with increases in the national minimum wage, raised by 101 percent in August.</p>
