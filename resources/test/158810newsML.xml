<p>France has flown home 22 Moroccan and 16 Zairean immigrants in the 29th such expulsion since the conservative government took office 17 months ago, the interior ministry said on Thursday.</p>
<p>It said the immigrants, either illegal immigrants or convicts expelled after serving prison sentences, were flown home on Wednesday aboard a government-chartered airliner.</p>
<p>The government, which has pledged a crackdown on clandestine immigration, has expelled more than 18,000 illegal residents since it took office, including more than 10,500 this year.</p>
<p>In a crackdown on illegal labour, the authorities have closed down 34 sweatshops and ordered legal proceedings against 949 employers over the past few months, the ministry said.</p>
