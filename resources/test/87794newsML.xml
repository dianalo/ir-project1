<p>Shares in Imperial Tobacco Plc made their market debut on Tuesday at above the expected price range, valuing the company at just above 2.0 billion pounds ($3.12 billion) after its spin-off from conglomerate Hanson Plc.</p>
<p>Imperial shares began trading at 390 pence, above expectations that it would start at between 370 and 380 pence.</p>
<p>Imperial Tobacco chief executive Gareth Davis said the issue had gone well.</p>
<p>"It seems to have gone well so far -- we've been watching the screens with great interest," Davis told Reuters from the offices of ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, stockbrokers to the company.</p>
<p>"We look forward to the rest of the day -- it will be interesting when the Americans come in," he said.</p>
<p>"So far so good, I think is the term. It's pretty early days yet," Davis said.</p>
<p>Asked whether he expected good demand from the U.S., Davis said a seven-city roadshow to make presentations to institutions there had met good interest. "There seemed to be a very high degree of interest -- we were pleasantly surprised."</p>
<p>Imperial, Britain's second-largest tobacco company, is the first Hanson company to be spun off in a demerger process that will split the Anglo-U.S. conglomerate, built up by Lord Hanson and the late Lord White, into four separate units.</p>
<p>The second to go, Millennium Chemicals, begins trading in New York on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In later morning trade, Imperial shares settled at around 392 pence. At the start of trading, they were briefly in backwardation, which is when the highest buy price quoted by a market maker is above the best sell price quoted by another. ($1=.6408 Pound)</p>
