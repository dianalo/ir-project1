<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-Australian stocks end lower as gold dulls.</title>
<headline>RTRS-Australian stocks end lower as gold dulls.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-01-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Australian share market closed lower on Tuesday as broader sentiment softened slightly and the gold sector dived over three percent in response to the bullion price's downward trend.</p>
<p>At 4.10 p.m. (0510 GMT), the All Ordinaries index was 9.1 points lower at 2,400.7.</p>
<p>March share price index futures were down four points at 2,425 and were at a 24.3 point premium to the underlying index.</p>
<p>Brokers said there were few positive signals to compensate for the dip in the gold price and domestic economic data that showed a flat economy.  </p>
<p>"It's a bit softer with the Dow shaky and gold off," said a Sydney-based dealer, adding that local signals remained far from unequivocally positive.</p>
<p>"Local data is not showing great strength and that has created uncertainty on the domestic front."</p>
<p>November building approvals fell 1.6 percent and while retail sales rose 0.7 percent in the same period, economists said the result hardly indicative of strong economy.</p>
<p>"In anyone's language, the retail sector was weak in late 1996," said Stephen Koukoulas, chief economist at Citibank Australia.  </p>
<p>The gloom in the retail sector was highlighted by upmarket apparel retailer, Country Road, and jeans retailer, Just Jeans, with both announcing profit downgrades of 50 percent after the market closed.</p>
<p>Gold stocks continued their downward run with the gold index dipping 3.3 percent over the day. So far in 1997 the industry index has lost 6.7 percent.</p>
<p>Situation stock Highlands Gold went against the golds trend and was up one cent in active trade after hostile suitor Placer Dome said it would accept a Highlands restructuring plan.  </p>
<p>Falls outnumbered rises by a ratio of about nine to five, while about 28 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>FUTURES/OPTIONS - Futures remained at moderate levels while options trade bounced back to pre-holiday levels.</p>
<p>Total options traded 33,338 (20,594)</p>
<p>Turnover in March SPI contracts totalled 5,973 (5,989)</p>
<p>In other local markets,  Australian bond yields ended lower, rallying from their initial U.S. led mark-up after today's latest retail trade report with the 10 year T-bonds yielding 7.58 percent by 5.00 p.m. (0600 GMT).  </p>
<p>The Australian dollar regained offshore losses and the 79 cent level in a dogged rally Tuesday but was well adrift on the yen and short of safe territory.</p>
<p>An eventful session saw it start at one-month lows as U.S. banks sold heavily, but bids from local exporters and an upbeat report on A$ bonds from a U.S. investment bank stopped the rot.</p>
<p>AUD/yen buying from Tokyo and talk of a revival in samurai issues also helped, but the support evaporated when comments from various Japanese ministers sent US$/yen diving and by 5.00 p.m. (0600 GMT) the local currency was quoted at US$0.7903/08.  </p>
