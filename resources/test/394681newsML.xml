<p>Providian Bancorp, a unit of Providian Corp, filed Friday a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell up to $1.42 billion in asset backed certificates.</p>
<p>When combined with a previous registration, Providian will have up to $2 billion in certificates available for sale, the filing said.  </p>
<p>The certificates will be sold through First Deposit National Bank and Providian National Bank "evidencing undivided interests in certain assets of First Deposit Master Trust." Net proceeds will be used for the banks' general corporate purposes.</p>
<p>Each of the banks is a national banking association and wholly-owned subsidiary of Providian Bancorp Inc, based in San Francisco, Calif.</p>
<p>The parent, Providian Corp, is a financial services company which is principally engaged in the insurance, investment management and banking businesses.  </p>
<p>On Dec 28, 1996, Providian Corp entered into an agreement to merge its insurance business with Aegon USA, a subsidiary of Aegon NV and to spin off all the outstanding shares of common stock of Providian Bancorp.</p>
<p>If the spinoff were successfully completed, Providian Bancorp Inc would become a separate, publicly held company. The merger and spinoff are expected to occur in mid-1997.</p>
