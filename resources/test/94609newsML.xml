<p>NWE oil products were mostly steady to firmer with only gas oil taking a break from recent gains.</p>
<p>Naphtha prices were steady to firmer. Buying interest was quite strong, but still pretty relaxed and trade was thin.</p>
<p>Gasoline was steady to a touch firmer. A Rotterdam refiner who has been covering all week payed up to $210 a tonne for Rotterdam refinery material but later sold barges at $211.</p>
<p>Gas oil eased as a holiday in the key Geramn market stifled buying and IPE futures retraced some of Wednesday's sharp gains.</p>
<p>High sulphur cracked fuel oil barges were around $1 a tonne firmer but cargo prices were stable.</p>
