<p>The U.S. economy appears a touch winded, but ready to dance a few more songs before sitting one out, analysts say.</p>
<p>Nearing the end of its sixth consecutive year of expansion, the economy has astounded the pundits with its consistent, if unspectacular, growth.</p>
<p>"This has been a remarkably good run of growth. We've not really had strong growth, but it's been good steady growth," said David Hensley, economist at Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>By all reckonings that run should continue in 1997.</p>
<p>A poll of 10 major banks and brokerages shows a consensus forecast for 2.11 percent growth in real, or inflation-adjusted, gross domestic product growth in 1997.</p>
<p>While that modest forecast will certainly fail to excite most Americans, economists raved over the prospects of a slight slowdown from recent growth rates deemed unsustainable without boosting inflation.</p>
<p>"The pace of growth will subside, but I consider that fairly positive for an expansion that's getting on in years. The economy is straining just a little bit at the outer edges," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Bank Corp.</p>
<p>After growing by 3.5 percent in 1994 and 2.0 percent in 1995, the economy appears to have grown at about a 2.65 percent annual rate in 1996, according to the Reuters poll.</p>
<p>That recent strength has some economists worried about inflation, which tends to rise when the economy operates above its potential, or theoretical non-inflationary speed limit, currently seen in the vicinity of 2.0 percent.</p>
<p>While the economy will grow near that limit in 1997, the recent whittling away of available U.S. resources, notably labour, could portend mild inflationary gains, analysts said.</p>
<p>U.S. unemployment stood at 5.4 percent in November, a level many analysts deem too low to keep inflation from rising.</p>
<p>Growth at the economy's potential would likely keep the labour market near current levels, which could keep wages and overall inflation on the rise, analysts said.</p>
<p>"That does imply a gradual increase in wage and price inflation," said Hensley.</p>
<p>Most sectors of the economy should continue to expand at a moderate pace in 1996, with the notable exceptions of housing and automobiles, analysts said.</p>
<p>Single-family home sales fell 9.1 percent in October and analysts said that more weakness lies ahead, especially if long-term interest rates trend higher as expected in 1997.</p>
<p>Auto sales should also slow, primarily due to higher interest rates.</p>
<p>"Those are two big industries with a lot of ripple effects. We have exhausted a lot of pent-up demand in the economy," PNC's Hoffman said.</p>
<p>On the positive side, exports should begin to accelerate as Europe and Japan rebound from weak economies in 1997, analysts said. The chronic shortfall between exported U.S. goods and imports should begin to narrow as a result.</p>
<p>"Instead of bringing down growth, we are assuming the trade balances will begin to level off and become a neutral factor," said Steve Slifer, chief financial markets economist at Lehman Government Securities.</p>
<p>The prospect of a slower economy in 1997 with increasing, but still modest inflationary pressures should cheer policy-makers at the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Analysts are split over the direction of Fed-controlled short-term interest rates, but they do agree that any increase in the overnight federal funds rate, the rate banks charge each other for short-term loans, will be modest.</p>
<p>The Fed has not moved the funds rate from its 5.25 percent perch since Jan. 31, 1995.</p>
<p>The economy has avoided many of the imbalances that have triggered rapid inflation and drastic monetary policy moves in the past, which should give Fed officials pause before they raise rates this time around, analysts said.</p>
<p>"We could easily see a slightly higher growth scenario (than forecast) without causing the Fed to act. We also could see a slower growth scenario where the risk of recession is very prominent," said Bill Sharp, economist at Smith Barney.</p>
<p>The ambiguity of most forecasts, with analysts readily conceding the 2.0 percent consensus could be off by half a percentage point in either direction, underscores the humility many economists currently feel.</p>
<p>Few would have predicted the current expansion would have lasted this long when it began in early 1991, and the experts have little explanation for its duration.</p>
<p>"The economy looks good to me. But every now and then a patient gets a great check-up from the doctor and drops dead a week later," said PNC's Hoffman.</p>
