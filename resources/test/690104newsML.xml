<p>Trikon Technologies Inc said Wednesday it will record a "significant loss" for the June 30 second quarter, primarily as a result of accounting charges associated with an acquisition last year and the early retirement of debt.</p>
<p>The company did not offer an estimate for the loss, but the First Call consensus earnings per share estimate for Trikon's second quarter is a loss of $0.10 versus a profit of $0.15 a year ago.  </p>
<p>The company said earnings will be hurt by the write-up of inventory obtained with the November 1996 acquisition of Electrotech Group. Earnings were also set back by about $850,000 for a non-cash charge related to the early termination of a $6.25 million subordinated debt commitment from a group of private investors, it said.</p>
<p>Trikon said it sees revenue for the second quarter of about $19.5 million versus $11.9 million in the first quarter. Growth was led by orders for Trikon's MORI Oxide Etch and Flowfill CVD systems.  </p>
<p>Separately, Trikon also said it expects to amend its $35 million revolving line of bank credit and anticipates a private placement of convertible preferred stock valued between $15 million and $20 million.</p>
<p>The stock will pay no dividend and will be convertible into common stock on a share-for-share basis, it said. Investors will also receive warrants to buy Trikon common stock at $8 per share in a share amount equal to 30 percent of the preferred shares bought by each investor.</p>
<p>Net proceeds of the offering will be used for working capital, including increased investment in 300mm technologies, continuing research and development, and other capital expenditures, Trikon said. The private placement will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933.</p>
<p>Trikon also said it has negotiated an amendment to its $35 million revolving line of credit. The amendment is conditioned upon the closing of the private placement. Both are anticipated to close June 27.</p>
<p>The credit amendment and private placement will give Trikon the capital needed to grow its business, it said. Trikon provides manufacturing systems used for the manufacture of semiconductors.</p>
