<p>U.S. spot crudes closed Thursday on a strong note, finding support from short covering and developing fears of run cuts at refineries in the Caribbean as Hurricane Eduoard and Fran progress.</p>
<p>Traders were especially keyed on the prospects the large Amerada Hess refinery in St Croix would be impacted.</p>
<p>Backwardation between the October and November months ended the session at 53 cts, slightly wider than Wednesday, but narrowed from earlier levels above 60 cts.</p>
<p>October West Texas Intermediate/Cushing ended at around $22.15-$22.25, 45-55 cts higher than the Wednesday close.</p>
