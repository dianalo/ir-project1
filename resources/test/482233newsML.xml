<p>The Pennsylvania House has begun debate on a proposed $17 billion fiscal 1998 budget, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Senate is expected to consider the budget over the next two weeks, with May as a target date for the governor's signature. The fiscal year begins July 1.</p>
<p>On Monday, Pennsylvania said its fiscal 1997 surplus had grown to $370 million, sparking debate on whether it should be spent or saved.</p>
<p>The current budget plan would increase spending on education by more than $150 million. The poorest 135 school districts would receive increases of at least four percent over 1997 levels, and the rest would see one percent boosts, the paper said.</p>
<p>The budget also would trim business taxes by $41.5 million.</p>
<p>Debate has not yet begun on Gov. Tom Ridge's separate proposal to raise $400 million a year for road construction and maintenance through a gas tax and fee increase. Ridge's plan to sell state-owned liquor stores will also be considered separately from the budget.</p>
