<p>A growing number of British companies are launching new products, after shying away from that business strategy since the last recession, experts said on Monday.  Developing new consumer products is expensive and prone to failure, but an increasing number of British firms now think it is a risk worth taking, industry experts told Reuters.</p>
<p>"It is estimated that eight out of 10 of the products under development fail to reach the shelves, but companies are willing to give it a try anyway," said David Goudge of new product consultancy, The Brand Development Business.</p>
<p>"During the recession companies didn't want to take risks and so the number of new products launched fell. Now there is a lot of work going on. If you get it right then the rewards can be high," he said.</p>
<p>But companies are not rushing headlong into getting new products on supermarket shelves.</p>
<p>"They are taking a much more serious and considered approach to new product development than in the past, to try and ensure that they do not waste their money," said Goudge.</p>
<p>Because the risks are high, new product development is carried out in great secrecy -- often over a number of years. Extensive testing sessions are carried out with selected groups of consumers to gauge their reactions but they are not told the name of the product or even who makes it.</p>
<p>The biggest sectors for new product development are currently food and drink.</p>
<p>"A lot of British companies are looking at the next generation of 'alcopops' -- alcoholic soft drinks and at healthy energy drinks," said Richard Watson, a branding and design consultant.</p>
<p>But he added: "With new product development there is always an element of 'me-too' -- a company will look at what its competitor is selling and think we must develop one of those. They often turn out to be disasters and never see the light of day."</p>
<p>However, for every disaster, said Goudge, there is a product which has a tremendous impact on the market. "Who would ever have believed there would be a market for alcoholic lemonade? But there is and it's huge," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Confectionery company Cadbury Schweppes Plc spent five years developing its latest chocolate bar, Fuse -- a combination of fudge, biscuits, peanuts and raisins held together with chocolate.</p>
<p>"We spent six million pounds ($9.8 million) developing Fuse and tried 250 different ingredients. Then we tested and tested and tested again until we got it right," said Cadbury spokesman Tony Bilsborough.</p>
<p>Since its launch last September, Fuse has become one of the top five best selling chocolate bars in the country and for a period even knocked from its top position Britain's favourite chocolate bar, the Kit-Kat, made by Nestle.</p>
