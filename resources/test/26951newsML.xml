<p>Production losses at Gold Fields Namibia Ltd's Tsumeb operations due to strike action were running at around a million rand in revenue and 80 tonnes of copper a day, a company spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>The company's Tsumeb Corp Ltd (TCL) mines have been shut down since August 23 when Mineworkers' Union of Namibia members took control of key areas, including the copper smelter.</p>
<p>Gold Fields spokesman Dermot Whyte told Reuters the mines remained closed on Monday and revenue losses were about a million rand a day.</p>
<p>Whyte said production losses as a result of the strike were about 80 tonnes of copper a day or 960 tonnes of copper since the strike began 12 days ago.</p>
<p>TCL sold about 6,789 tonnes of copper in the quarter to end-June.</p>
<p>Whyte said there still was no end in sight to the labour action.</p>
<p>"We are in the process of trying to find a mediator to try and solve the problem but for the last few days we've been deadlocked," Whyte said.</p>
<p>He said Gold Fields had been in contact with the union. "We have been talking on and off".</p>
<p>The company said last week the copper smelter had been badly damaged by strikers and could remain shut for six weeks or longer.</p>
<p>The lead smelter, which was shut down before the strike, also remained out of commission.</p>
<p>Union members took control of certain key areas of TCL, including the copper smelter and Kombat property almost two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The company obtained an urgent interim court interdict on August 22 declaring the strike unlawful but Namibian police have found it difficult to enforce the court order.</p>
