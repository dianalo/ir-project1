<p>Dutch engineering consultancy Heidemij said on Tuesday its acquisition of Chilean engineering agency Geotecnica and Dutch-based Articon had helped boost profits in the 1997 second quarter.</p>
<p>The group earlier reported that second quarter profits rose to 9.2 million guilders ($4.5 million) from a year-earlier 8.3 million and forecast a "clear increase" in full-year net before extraordinary items.</p>
<p>Geotecnica was acquired in March, while the acquisition of Articon, an engineering and architectural consultancy, was completed in August, Heidemij said.</p>
<p>It said the Dutch infrastructure market was continuing to develop favourably and it had succeeded in winning more orders.</p>
<p>But  the market for soil decontamination projects, one of Heidemij's traditional undertakings, was suffering from price pressures after the government's decision to abandon the principle that industrial sites should be useable for all purposes when the orginal use ends, Heidemij said.</p>
<p>The German market continued to be poor because of  the slump in the construction sector, Heidemij said. "It is not expected that this situation will improve before mid-1998," it added.</p>
<p>In France the market situation was expected to improve in the second half of the year, while the Spanish private sector market was developing well, Heidemij said.</p>
<p>Spain's public sector remained difficult, although the strong decline in construction demand appeared to be levelling off, it said.</p>
<p>The U.S. infrastructure market was developing favourably and Heidemij was reaping the benefits of its strong position in the area of mobile telecoms networks, it said.</p>
<p>But it said the U.S environmental market continued to suffer from overcapacity and price pressures.</p>
