<p>More than half the inhabitants of Brazil's bustling metropolis, Sao Paulo, dislike their city so much they want to leave, a poll published on Sunday showed.</p>
<p>The survey, carried out by the Gallup Institute and published in the Estado de Sao Paulo newspaper, found that 63 percent of people in Latin America's biggest city dreamed about living in the countryside or in the tropical northeast.</p>
<p>The poll showed a 23 percent increase in dissatisfaction when compared with a similar Gallup survey 20 years ago.</p>
<p>Traffic chaos, crime, violence and pollution were the main reasons Sao Paulo inhabitants hated their city.</p>
<p>But, according to Estado, only about 13 percent realised their dream of buying property outside the urban jungle.</p>
<p>"The less satisfied they are, the more they dream about the impossible," Gallup superintendent Carlos Eduardo Meireles Matheus, told the paper.</p>
<p>Greater Sao Paulo is home to 16.4 million people, more than 10 percent of the country's population, making it the continent's largest city.</p>
