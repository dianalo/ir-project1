<p>Pakistani cotton rates remained firm on Saturday mainly on demand from textile mill owners, but are likely to slip in the near term on increased supplies from the main growing Punjab province, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The supply of good quality cotton has not yet started in the Punjab province. Once supply of quality cotton increases, the prices will slip," dealer Kishan Chand said.</p>
<p>In the kerb market, the NIAB-78 variety was quoted between 2,000 ($53.96) and 2,100 rupees per maund (37.32 kg), he said.</p>
<p>Saturday's official spot rates issued by the private Karachi Cotton Association in rupees per maund, including a 10 percent sales tax:</p>
<p>					   Saturday	   Previous</p>
