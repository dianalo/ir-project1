<p>A Norwegian protestant bishop wants all air traffic grounded when funerals take place in churches near Oslo's new principal airport, which will be inaugurated next year, daily Aftenposten said on Monday.</p>
<p>It quoted Bishop Even Fougner of Borg diocese as saying it would be difficult to carry out burial ceremonies in a dignified manner with jetliners roaring low overhead.</p>
<p>Seven churches will be under the flight paths of aircraft at Gardermoen, which at present is used only for charter flights. It will take over from Fornebu as the international airport in the Oslo region in October 1998.</p>
<p>"It would be sad if we were forced to stop the age-old tradition of bearing the coffin to the grave," Fougner told Aftenposten. "It must be possible to ground all air traffic a few times every week."</p>
<p>Johan Borchgrevink, planning chief at the National Aviation Board, said complying with the request would be difficult given the frequency of flights. Fornebu has takeoffs and landings every other minute during operational hours.</p>
<p>"Everything is possible...but it would be hard to stop all traffic for 15 to 30 minutes," he said.</p>
