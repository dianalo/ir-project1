<p>Pacific Gas and Electric Co said Wednesday it signed an agreement with CellNet Data Systems Inc to install its automated meter reading system for an information technology demonstration project.</p>
<p>Financial details were undisclosed.</p>
<p>Under the multi-year agreement, installation of the CellNet Network Meter Reading system will begin in December for some residential, commercial and industrial customers in PG&amp;E's Delta District in eastern Contra Costa County, Calif.</p>
<p>By mid-1997, PG&amp;E plans to use CellNet's wireless network to read approximately 55,000 electric and 45,000 gas meters.</p>
<p>"This new technology may lead to enhanced customer services such as automated outage detection, more timely service restoration, and more flexible billing and payment options," PG&amp;E Information Technology Program Manager Ron Williams, said in a statement.</p>
<p>As PG&amp;E evaluates the system, it may consider moving forward with additional automated meter reading projects.</p>
