<p>Intricate details of how Vietnam's criminals are executed by firing squad were published on Monday in one of the country's most popular newspapers.</p>
<p>The People's Police journal carried a picture of the unmarked grave of a teenager who was put to death last year for murdering a policeman, and another of the site where eight people will be executed for their part in a massive drugs ring, and then buried.</p>
<p>Apparently seeking to frighten would-be criminals, the same paper last year ran a photograph of a child murderer that was taken just moments before the firing squad opened fire.</p>
<p>Its latest article explained that condemned criminals are taken before dawn to a desolate site outside Hanoi, read the court's verdict, offered noodle soup, a cigarette and the chance to write a last letter home.</p>
<p>They are then tied to a wooden pole, and shot by five policemen, each with one bullet in his rifle.</p>
<p>"After the shots, the commander goes up to check and fires a last 'humane shot' in the ear," the paper said.</p>
<p>It said there were already 16 graves at the site.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the next one would be filled by former police captain Vu Xuan Truong, who became a household name during the recent trial of 22 people for flooding the country with heroin from the opium poppy-growing corners of Burma and Laos.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court last week rejected appeals for leniency by all but three of the 22 convicted in May's courtroom drama, which means eight will be put to death and the rest will go to jail.</p>
<p>Communist Vietnam has taken a strong stand in the past year against organised and violent crime, which many in the government link to the country's increasingly freewheeling society.</p>
<p>According to Amnesty International, Vietnamese courts sentenced 113 people to death in 1996.</p>
