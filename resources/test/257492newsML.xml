<p>Malaysia's International Trade and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz on Sunday denied claims that the just-concluded World Trade Organisation (WTO) meeting was dominated by the developed countries.</p>
<p>Fending off criticism from non-governmental organisations she said developing countries determined the outcome of the Singapore meeting and not the developed countries.</p>
<p>"This shows that the developed countries have to subscribe to the needs of the developing countries and not otherwise," Rafidah was quoted by the national Bernama news agency as telling reporters.</p>
<p>The NGOs had claimed that the developed countries had hijacked the meeting by promoting their own interests.</p>
<p>They said that discussions on liberalisation of regulations on information technology products were put on fast track while products which the developing countries had interest in, such as textiles and clothing, were neglected.</p>
<p>"I don't understand their mentality. As a matter of fact, it was developing countries that successfully excluded the labour clause from the WTO agreement," Rafidah said.</p>
<p>"It was the developing countries that fought for the cause and not the NGOs," she said.</p>
