<p>The French government said Friday it had halted the privatisation of Thomson-CSF and would propose an alternative solution to build a French defence electronics conglomerate around the company.</p>
<p>The state would retain a stake that gave it ultimate decision-making power, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin's office said in a statement issued after markets closed on the eve of a long Bastille Day holiday weekend.</p>
<p>The decision leaves the French defence industry isolated in Europe and means it faces a potentially tough internal restructuring before it can move forward with European alliances, one defence industry analyst said.</p>
<p>It also means that France and Europe lose more vital time in their race to team up to face tough competition from U.S. defence groups that have merged and increased their efficiency.</p>
<p>"One can see that the French industry is isolated," Natexis Capital analyst Antoine Nodet said.</p>
<p>New guidelines for Thomson-CSF, aimed at promoting European defence industry cooperation, would be put into practice "in the coming weeks," the government statement said.</p>
<p>Jospin's Socialist-led government suspended the process of selling the state's 58-percent holding in Thomson-CSF, launched by its conservative predecessors, after it won an upset victory in a parliamentary election on June 1.</p>
<p>Two French companies, the conglomerate Lagardere Groupe and engineering firm Alcatel Alsthom, had bid for the company.</p>
<p>Since French defence companies are too small to tackle the world market alone and virtually all the major European companies have already formed alliances, French firms must link up if they want to be major international players, Nodet said.</p>
<p>"Before this decision it (internal restructuring) was a choice, now it is an imperative," he said.</p>
<p>The decision may lead to a merger between Thomson-CSF and state-owned planemaker Aerospatiale since such a link would give the sort of vertical integration favoured by defence giants in the United States.</p>
<p>Former Prime Minister Alain Juppe was forced to call off a first attempt to sell parent company Thomson SA to Lagardere privately last year after the state Privatisation Commission objected to the sale of its Thomson Multimedia subsidiary to South Korea's Daewoo Group.</p>
<p>Alcatel said in a statement it was awaiting the new government decisions and remained interested in being a central part of alliances in the French defence industry.</p>
<p>Nodet said it was likely Alcatel would still be associated in some way with Thomson-CSF in a new French defence giant.</p>
<p>There was no immediate reaction from Lagardere Groupe, which controls electronics firm Matra SA , which has now seen its second attempt to buy Thomson thwarted.</p>
