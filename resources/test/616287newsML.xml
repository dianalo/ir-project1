<p>The Bulgarian lev inched up to 1,568-1,570 per dollar at the close from the morning's 1,569-1,571 amid high demand for levs for pending payments as the central bank was seen curbing the lev rise, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Foreign currency supply was high throughout the day as banks and clients sought levs to meet wage and tax payments at the end of the month. But the market was dollar-bearish," a bank dealer said.</p>
<p>The central bank was seen buying dollars at market rates, containing the lev rise, said traders. Central bank officials were unavailable for comment.  </p>
<p>Low lev liquidity also caused a rise in demand for short-term funds on the interbank deposit market but depo rates were unchanged from Monday at 35-38 percent annually for 1-2 day deposits and 40-43 percent for one-week.</p>
<p>Traders said low lev liqidity was due to the lack of large principal and interest payments on government securities this week.</p>
<p>The mark closed at 923/925 levs.  </p>
