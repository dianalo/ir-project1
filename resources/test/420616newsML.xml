<p>Zaire ordered a popular private television station to shut down for three months for violating a ban on political broadcasts, the owner said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But Ngongo Luwowo told Reuters his Tele Kin Malebo (TKM) channel would ignore what he called an illegal order, announced by a government facing a difficult rebel war.</p>
<p>"The notification says that on March 1st and 2nd, TKM broadcast news bulletins and press reviews, and that those are political programmes," said Ngongo, a member of parliament who supports veteran President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>Information Minister Kolono Longo imposed restrictions on private TV and radio broadcasts last month, citing the war. Tutsi-led rebels took up arms against Mobutu's government last October and have taken over a vast stretch of eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>TKM broadcast its normal programmes on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We will not inerrupt our transmission. The law does not bestow upon the minister the power to interdict political broadcasts," Ngongo said.</p>
<p>Some half a dozen private TV stations have sprung up in Zaire's sprawling capital Kinshasa in the past six years.</p>
<p>TKM, which is only six months old, is one of the most watched, building its audience on a diet of lively political debates featuring politicians of all tendencies.</p>
