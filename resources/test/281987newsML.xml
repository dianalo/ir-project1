<p>Former U.S. President George Bush on Monday praised President Alberto Fujimori's tough stance during Peru's hostage crisis which he compared to his own handling of the 1991 Gulf conflict.</p>
<p>"I greatly admire the firmness of your position and your courage. Indeed many Americans, including myself, are very proud of you," Bush said, according to a Spanish translation of a letter he sent to Fujimori released by Peru's Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>Bush, who met Fujimori in Peru in November, said the hostage crisis in Lima reminded him of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's seizure of dozens of foreigners as "human shields" following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.</p>
<p>"Many people advised us to negotiate with him (Hussein) about the hostages. We did not. Finally he freed the hostages," Bush wrote.</p>
<p>Fujimori, who has spoken only once in public since the hostage crisis began on Dec 17, has refused to meet the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels and flatly rejected their demands.</p>
<p>About 20 heavily armed MRTA guerrillas still held 83 VIP hostages -- including Fujimori's brother, top government and military officials, three ambassadors and a handful of Japanese businessmen -- inside the Japanese ambassador's residence late Monday.</p>
