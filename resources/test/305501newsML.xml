<p>The Zagreb Stock Exchange said on Tuesday it listed Croatia's first sovereign debt issue of 300 million kuna-denominated Eurobonds, launched in December 1996.</p>
<p>But proper trade will be halted till February 17, the end of a lock-up period by which actual bonds must be issued to investors, Vladimir Puskaric of the listing committee told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>The issue, yielding a fixed 12.5 percent a year, was offered in equal portions of 150 million kuna to foreign and Croatian investors.</p>
<p>It was selling at 98.50 percent of the 10,000 kuna face value of bonds by January 7. They mature on December 18, 1998.</p>
<p>Each buyer got a letter of entitlement, which can only be traded back to the bank that sold them in the first place, Puskaric said.</p>
<p>Four Croatian banks -- Zagrebacka, Trgovacka, Varazdinska and Dalmatinska -- undertook to make a market in Eurokuna in Croatia.</p>
