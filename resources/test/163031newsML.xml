<headline>NHL ICE HOCKEY-BRETT HULL SCORES TWICE AS BLUES BEAT STARS.</headline>
<dateline>ST LOUIS 1996-11-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brett Hull scored twice and Pierre Turgeon posted his first two points in a Blues uniform, leading St Louis to a 6-3 win over the Dallas Stars Sunday.</p>
<p>The win snapped a four-game losing streak for last-place St Louis, while first-place Dallas lost for just the fourth time in 13 games overall.</p>
<p>"In three of the last four games, we played very well for most of the game and then it broke down in certain situations," Hull said. "We've got a good team. We just have to work hard and play defence."</p>
<p>Turgeon, acquired last week from Montreal in a five-player deal, scored his first point late in the first period when he got an assist on rookie Harry York's power-play goal.</p>
<p>After Dallas tied the score 84 seconds later on the first of Benoit Hogue's two goals, St Louis was on the power play when Stars captain Mike Modano was sent off for an obstruction hooking minor at 16:47. The Blues capitalised.</p>
<p>Turgeon held the puck in the right corner and passed it to Hull, who one-timed a shot from the right circle past Arturs Irbe to give the Blues a one-goal lead just 29 seconds later.</p>
<p>"With the addition of Pierre, we got a guy who can control his end and the offensive end," said Hull.</p>
<p>"They seemed to have some chemistry tonight," said Blues coach Mike Keenan about his line of Geoff Courtnall, Hull and Turgeon, which combined for four points. "We have to depend on them. When we have three of them together, they have to be top billing."</p>
<p>Scott Pellerin, who signed with the Blues as a free agent following three seasons with New Jersey, scored his first goal of the season with one minute to play in the first period, but the Stars made it a 3-2 game just 27 seconds later on Pat Verbeek's unassisted marker.</p>
<p>Jim Campbell, the NHL's Rookie of the Month for October, scored his seventh goal 12:44 into the second period and Courtnall added an unassisted goal 13 seconds into the third period. Hull got an unassisted goal with just over seven minutes to play.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Tony Amonte, Denis Savard and Eric Daze scored power-play goals and Ed Belfour had 28 saves as the Blackhawks continued their dominance of the Edmonton Oilers with a 4-2 victory.</p>
<p>Daze and Alexei Zhamnov each had a goal and an assist for Chicago, which is 4-0-1 against Edmonton in the last two seasons and has not lost to the Oilers in Chicago since October 15, 1992. Chicago is 13-1-2 in its last 16 meetings with Edmonton.</p>
<p>Andrei Kovalenko and Mats Lindgren tallied for the Oilers, who started their season-high six-game, 13-day road trip. Edmonton does not play in the Northlands Coliseum until November 17 because the Canadian Rodeo is being held in the arena.</p>
<p>The Blackhawks were 3-of-5 on the power play. Edmonton was 1-for-7 with the extra man.</p>
<p>In Anaheim, Roman Oksiuta scored a power-play goal with less than two seconds left in regulation to lift the Mighty Ducks to a 1-1 tie with the Colorado Avalanche.</p>
<p>With newly acquired Keith Jones called for tripping Jari Kurri with 1:45 to go, Frederik Olausson held the puck at the right point and passed it towards the left side of the net. Oksiuta, who was cutting in from the left boards, flipped the puck past Carig Billington for the game-tying tally.</p>
<p>Joe Sakic scored for Colorado in the second period.</p>
<p>Billington made 31 saves for Colorado. Guy Hebert stopped 33 shots for the Ducks.</p>
<p>Both teams are 0-0-3 in overtime this season.</p>
<p>In Phoenix, Vincent Damphousse scored with 9:24 left in regulation to lift the Montreal Canadiens into a 4-4 tie with the Coyotes.</p>
<p>The Canadiens ended their three-game losing streak but had their winless streak extended to four games. Montreal is 1-5-1 in its last seven games.</p>
<p>Stephane Richer, Mark Recchi and Martin Rucinsky scored Montreal's first three goals.</p>
<p>Phoenix got a pair of goals and an assist from Dallas Drake. Keith Tkachuk and Craig Janney also tallied.</p>
<p>The Coyotes had a couple of chances near the end of overtime, including slot blasts by Tkachuk and Teppo Numminen, but could not win it.</p>
<p>Jose Theodore, in his second career start, made 46 saves for the Canadiens and Nikolai Khabibulin finished with 27 for the Coyotes.</p>
