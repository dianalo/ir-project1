<p>Britain embarks on a new era of politics on Saturday with its youngest prime minister this century, Tony Blair, facing up to the realities of power after his Labour Party's 18 years of opposition.</p>
<p>Blair, 43, swept through a triumphant, flag-waving throng into the prime minister's official residence at 10, Downing Street, on Friday and pledged to "bring this nation together, to unite as one Britain, one nation."</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, he announced the key appointments to his cabinet, offering few surprises, and he was expected to complete the line-up on Saturday.</p>
<p>He confirmed deputy Labour leader John Prescott would be deputy prime minister. Stern Scot Gordon Brown was named Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) and another Scot, Robin Cook, reputed to have one of the sharpest minds in parliament, was appointed foreign minister.</p>
<p>The cabinet also includes Britain's first blind minister and is likely to have the first openly homosexual one.</p>
<p>With his cabinet in place, Blair will begin drawing up his government's legislative programme which will be laid out in a speech given by Queen Elizabeth when the newly-elected parliament assembles on May 14.</p>
<p>He has pledged to make reforms of state education his first priority and he also plans an overhaul of the health service, but Brown has pledged not to raise personal taxes.</p>
<p>For the Conservatives, routed in their worst election defeat for over 100 years, the search for a new leader began as soon as humiliated prime minister John Major said he was stepping down.</p>
<p>"When the curtain falls, it is time to leave the stage," Major said as he left 10, Downing Street, his London home for the past seven years, for the final time.</p>
<p>Former chancellor Kenneth Clarke wasted no time in declaring himself a potential leadership candidate as other senior figures in the shell-shocked party called for a period of calm.</p>
<p>Several Conservatives blamed party divisions over the European Union for Thursday's resounding defeat. The Conservatives lost more than half the parliamentary seats they were defending and Labour won an overall majority of more than 170.</p>
<p>At least 200 Conservative candidates openly defied Major's "wait-and-see" line on a proposed single European currency and he was forced into a desperate plea to his party not to tie his hands in EU negotiations he will not now take part in.</p>
<p>Blair's victory was widely welcomed in Europe, where he is seen as more of a pragmatist than Major.</p>
<p>Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok and European Commission President Jacques Santer were among those sending their congratulations to him.</p>
<p>"It's an outstanding victory for the Labour Party," Santer said. "We are looking forward to working very closely with the government."</p>
