<p>Czech bank Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s. said it had raised its prime rate on Tuesday to 25.00 percent from 11.75 percent following a sharp increase in interbank rates spurred by central bank moves.  </p>
<p>"The CSOB is continuously monitoring the situation on the market and might update the interest rates daily before 9 a.m. (0700 GMT)," CSOB said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The motivation for today's change of the rates is, above all, to prevent potential speculations at the expense of the bank," the statement said.</p>
<p>CSOB said had confidence in measures taken by the central bank in order to calm the foreign exchange market following a sharp drop if the crown last week.</p>
<p>The CNB raised its last resort Lombard rate to 50 percent on Friday from previous 14 percent to avoid short-selling of the currency. It also increased the repo rate to 45 percent on Monday from 12.9 percent on Friday previous 12.4 percent.</p>
<p>The CNB said on Tuesday it had begun to restrict bank's access to Lombard to the extent of an unspecified portion of individual bank's capital.</p>
<p>The CSOB had announced a 0.3 percent increase of its prime rate to 12.02 percent on Monday, effective on Tuesday, but rescinded its decision later on Monday.</p>
