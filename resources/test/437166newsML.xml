<p>Sri Lanka's survival depends on the adoption of a new constitution, to be put to parliament before the next budget debate, a senior cabinet minister was quoted on Wednesday as saying.</p>
<p>"The choice is between national devastation and national survival," the state-owned Daily News quoted Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister Gamini Lakshman Peiris as telling a seminar.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka's budget is usually presented to parliament in November.</p>
<p>The Daily News quoted Peiris as saying a parliamentary select committee debating the new constitution would complete the remaining chapters on devolution of power by the end of May.</p>
<p>The new constitution incorporates the government's devolution proposals designed to end the war by Tamil Tiger rebels for an independent homeland in the Indian Ocean island's north and east.</p>
<p>The proposals offer extensive autonomy to minority Tamils and have been opposed by hardline members of the majority Sinhalese community, who fear they could lead to the separate state the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are fighting for.</p>
<p>The plan envisages the creation of several regional councils and would turn Sri Lanka into a federal state in all but name.</p>
<p>A Tamil political leader said the main Tamil party and a key Moslem party, an ally of the ruling People's Alliance coalition, were close to an agreement on the boundaries of the councils, a sticking point in talks to end the war.</p>
<p>"There's a fair amount of agreement between the Tamil United Liberation Front (TULF) and the Sri Lanka Moslem Congress (SLMC)," said TULF president Murugesu Sivasithamparam. He declined to give details.</p>
<p>Other politicians said the plan envisages carving out the mainly Sinhalese Amparai electorate from the multi-ethnic eastern province and attaching it to a neigbouring province in the island's interior.</p>
<p>The rest of the eastern province will be divided into a mainly Tamil northeastern province and a southeastern province where the majority will be Moslems, they said.</p>
<p>The Daily News said Peiris stressed the need to build a robust body of public opinion in favour of the devolution proposals.</p>
<p>The proposals have to be approved by a two-thirds majority in parliament and then at a national referendum.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the war, now in its 14th year.</p>
