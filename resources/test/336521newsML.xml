<p>Hopes of market-friendly government policy announcements led to a flurry of buy orders on Monday, driving Bombay stocks to higher levels, dealers said.</p>
<p>Bellweather stocks TISCO, SBI and Reliance led the market rally in hectic trade, they said.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of optimism around..foreign funds are picking up stocks...they don't want to miss out on the market's upward move," said Dilip Joshi, dealer at Prime Broking.</p>
<p>Indian premier H.D. Deve Gowda is scheduled to give a speech to members of the All India Association of Industries at 5 p.m. (1130 GMT) in Bombay.</p>
<p>A government spokesman said on Monday Gowda was not expected to announce any measures affecting the capital market during the visit. "The visit to Bombay is not connected to the capital markets. It has nothing to do with the capital markets," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm in the markets however persisted despite this dampener. The Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) top index ended 128.91 points up at a provisional 3,564.53.</p>
<p>The Bombay stocks index has risen around 15 percent this year inspired by a pledge by the Prime Minister on December 31 to unveil market-boosting policy initiatives.</p>
<p>"There's always hope and anticipation..nobody wants to get caught on the wrong side of the market..," said chief dealer Sanjeev Sanghvi at James Capel B&amp;K.</p>
<p>Traders said hesitation on the part of investors and local funds to sell stocks in a rising market coupled with increased speculative buy orders was stoking the price rally.</p>
<p>They said they expected policy measures to revive the capital market and to woo investment to be announced before the Indian premier leaves on January 31 for a World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>SBI rose 23.25 rupees to 294.0, Reliance 16.0 to 272.50 and TISCO 18.75 to 208.0.</p>
