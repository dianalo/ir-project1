<p>Fitch Investors Service said on Monday it assigned a AA rating to senior debt in a $5.0 billion securitisation by National Westminster Bank Plc.  </p>
<p>"Repeat Offering Securitisation Entity Funding (R.O.S.E. Funding) is a collateralisation of a $5.0 billion portfolio of corporate loans from NatWest's balance sheet," Fitch said.</p>
<p>Fitch said the ratings were contingent on receipt of final documents conforming to information already received.</p>
<p>R.O.S.E. Funding's $50 million mezzanine class A4 debt was given an expected A rating and its $55 million mezzanine class A5 debt BBB. R.O.S.E. Inc's $2.5 billion commercial paper was rated F1 plus. It said $100 million of class b debt was unrated.</p>
<p>"Credit enhancement levels for the provisional pool of loans were determined by stressing Fitch loan default probabilities in a cash flow model to ensure that available funds from the loans were sufficient to meet periodic payment needs arising from expenses, interest payments, chargeoffs and principal redemption," the Fitch statement said.  </p>
<p>"In the case of BBB-rated loans, Fitch's default probability is three times historical bond default levels, and, in the case of AAA rated loans, ten times historical bond default levels."</p>
<p>It said these credit enhancement levels were then subjected to an obligor concentration analysis to ensure coverage oif the largest obligors in the pool.</p>
<p>Fitch said the ratings were based on the available credit enhancement, the credit profile of National Westminster Bank, the high investment grade quality of the loans, the subparticipation structure, and NatWest's involvement in the transaction as loan administrator and swap counterparty.  </p>
<p>Fitch issued the following table for the expected ratings --</p>
