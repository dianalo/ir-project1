<headline>FAA orders inspection of European helicopters.</headline>

<p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration Friday ordered the grounding and inspection of some models of a European-made helicopter after an April 15 crash in New York that killed one man and injured three.</p>
<p>"The investigation of the accident revealed that the tail boom -- which holds the stabilizing rotor -- broke off," the FAA said in a statement. "It was determined the failure was caused by fatigue cracking."</p>
<p>The agency ordered all U.S. operators of specific Eurocopter Deutschland GmbH (ECD) helicopters to inspect the tail booms prior to further flight.</p>
<p>Eurocopter is 70 percent owned by France's state group Aerospatiale and 30 percent owned by Germany's Daimler-Benz Aerospace.</p>
<p>The directive involved 132 helicopters and required inspection of the tail boom of models MBB-BK117 A-1, A-3, A-4, B-1, B-2 and C-1, for cracks, loose rivets, or other anomalies, the statement said.</p>
<p>"If no cracks are found, the helicopter may be flown, but must be re-inspected every 100 hours of service," the FAA said.</p>
<p>If cracks were found, the helicopter must be grounded and may not fly again until the manufacturer has developed a repair procedure to submit to the FAA for approval, according to the agency's order.</p>
<p>The FAA said the directive was prompted by the crash of an ECD model MBB-BK117 series helicopter into New York's East River.</p>
<p>The aircraft belonged to Colgate-Palmolive Co., the household products giant, and carried a pilot, co-pilot and two passengers. The company's chief technical officer died in the crash.</p>
