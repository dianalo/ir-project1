<p>Full text of press release from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>Nov 26 - Real GDP will expand at an annual rate of 2.1 percent in the fourth quarter, according to 37 forecasters surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.  The growth rate will remain at 2 percent or slightly above in each quarter of 1997.  On a year-over-year basis, the outlook for real GDP growth is virtually unchanged from that in last quarter's survey: the forecasters continue to expect growth of 2.3 percent in 1996.  The economy will expand at an annual rate of 2.3 percent in 1997, up 0.1 percentage points from last quarter's survey.</p>
<p>The forecasters see little evidence of a buildup in price pressure. Inflation, as measured by the rate of change in the Consumer Price Index, will average roughly 3.0 percent at an annual rate in each of the next five quarters.  Measured on a fourth-quarter-over-fourth-quarter basis, inflation will average 3.1 percent in 1996, down slightly from 3.2 percent in last quarter's survey.  The forecasters expect inflation to average 3.0 percent in 1997, unchanged from last quarter's survey.</p>
<p>A rising path for the unemployment rate is accompanying the outlook for steady output growth and inflation.  The forecasters expect the unemployment rate to drift upward to 5.4 percent by the second quarter and to hold steady at that rate over the remainder of 1997.  Over this year and the next, the unemployment rate will average 5.4 percent, down 0.1 percentage points from last quarter's survey.</p>
<p>The following table compares median forecasts for selected variables from the current survey with those from three months ago:</p>

<p>1997 2.2     2.3	   3.0	3.0	    5.5   5.4</p>
<p>Forecasters Also See No Change on the Long-Term Inflation Front</p>
<p>The forecasters expect long-term inflation, as measured by the rate of change in the Consumer Price Index, to average 3.0 percent over the next 10 years.  The middle range of forecasts is 2.63 to 3.24 percent.  Long-term inflation expectations, as measured in this survey, are now unchanged for the fourth consecutive survey. Forecasters Are Revising Downward the Risk of a Negative Quarter</p>
<p>Although the forecasters see the chance of a negative quarter rising over the next five quarters (from 8 percent in the current quarter to 23 percent in the fourth), the possibility of a negative quarter is lower now than it was in the last survey.  The following table compares the probabilities in the current survey with those from the last:</p>
<p>			Mean Probability of a Decline in Real GDP</p>
<p>						 Previous     New</p>
<p>				 1996:   Q4    10.0	 8.0</p>
<p>				 1997:   Q1    16.0	11.0</p>
<p>					   Q2    20.0	16.0</p>
<p>					   Q3    23.0	21.0</p>
<p>					   Q4    N.A.	23.0</p>
<p>Some Flattening of the Yield Curve Is Seen in 1997</p>
<p>The forecasters expect a hike in short-term interest rates, as measured by the rate on three-month Treasury bills, of 0.2 percentage points in the first quarter of 1997.  In contrast, long-term rates, as measured by the rate on 10-year Treasury bonds, are expected to hold steady at 6.4 percent over the next three quarters.  For this year and the next, short-term rates are expected to average 5.0 and 5.2 percentage points; long-term rates are expected to average 6.5 and 6.4 percentage points over the same period.  Thus, on an annual-average basis, the  forecasters expect the spread between long- and short-term rates to narrow by 0.3 percentage points in 1997.  The following table shows the current forecast for three-month Treasury bill rates and 10-year Treasury bond rates:</p>

<p>The Philadelphia Fed's Survey of Professional Forecasters was formerly conducted by the American Statistical Association (ASA) and the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) and was known as the ASA/NBER survey.  The survey, which began in 1968, is conducted each quarter.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, in cooperation with the NBER, assumed responsibility for the survey in June 1990.</p>
