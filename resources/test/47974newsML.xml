<p>Chinese financial authorities have called for regulations to govern the nation's fledgling funds industry, the China Daily said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Financial authorities needed to strengthen their ability to supervise the industry, it quoted Vice Governor of the People's Bank of China Yin Jieyan as saying.</p>
<p>Authorities were reviewing two regulations, one on securities-investment fund management and one on Sino-foreign fund management companies, it said.</p>
<p>It did not say when the new regulations might be completed.</p>
<p>Financial specialists suggested that treasury bond funds be set up in the near future to speed the development of open-end funds. Almost all funds in China are closed-end, it said.</p>
<p>Greater quantities and varieties of treasury bonds and improved issuing and trading procedures were needed to promote treasury bond funds.</p>
<p>China has issued a record 180 billion yuan ($21.6 billion) of treasury debt this year.</p>
