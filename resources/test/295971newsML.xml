<title>NEW ZEALAND: RBNZ to buy back July 1997 bonds.</title>

<p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand said on Friday it was offering to repurchase government bonds maturing July 15, 1997 as part of its liquidity management operations.</p>
<p>The offer takes effect from 1 p.m. (0000 GMT) on Friday and will remain open until further notice.  </p>
<p>As at December 31, 1996, the net total of 7/97 bonds in the market was NZ$1.96 billion.</p>
<p>Dealers said it was fairly routine for the Reserve Bank to offer to repurchase short-dated bonds as soon as they came under six months to maturity.</p>
<p>However, the bank had not traditionally been an aggressive buyer, and its lack of competitiveness could explain the lack of a substantial rally in the 7/97s after the announcement.</p>
<p>The bond yield, currently nine basis points lower at 7.28 percent on the back of a strong money market, did not change at all on the back of the announcement.  </p>
<p>"It's been interesting today that the yield on them hasn't really rallied since the Reserve Bank came out and announced it. In the past the market rallied, but I think they've now realised that the Reserve Bank is never that close to the market. It tends to be always be wanting a bargain," one dealer said.</p>
<p>"In the past the buy-back operations have not been all that successful." -- Wellington Newsroom (64 4) 4734746</p>
