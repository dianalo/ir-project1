<p>The National Bank of Poland is expected to refrain from raising official rates in the near term after year-on-year inflation in December 1996 fell to 18.5 percent -- better than market expectations at 18.8 percent.</p>
<p>"December inflation data is better than what was expected by the market and signals that the central bank should not increase official rates in the near future," said Krzysztof Blendowski, chief economist at WoodCommerz in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Market expectations were for year-on-year price growth at around 18.8 percent, after 19.1 percent inflation in November and 21.6 percent at the end of 1995.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the market's uncertainty over whether the central bank would increase official rates has faded. The bank has increased market rates by some 2.5 percentage points in the last several weeks to cool fast growing credit action.</p>
<p>"The figures are good, though 18.3 percent inflation year-on-year would have been really optimistic, and it seems the slight panic over a potential interest rate rise has ended," said Radoslaw Radyszewski, deputy chief dealer at Pekao SA.</p>
<p>Analysts said the NBP, taking into account the higher market rates and the smaller-than-expected inflation, would likely keep rates flat until the end of the first quarter.  </p>
<p>"Rates should now be stable, most likely until the end of March...depending on how fast prices grow in the first several months of the year," Pekao's Radyszewski said.</p>
<p>Analysts said that if month-on-month inflation in January amounts to 2.7 percent, the year-on-year index would still fall to around 18 percent, making an increase of official rates, now at 25 and 22 percent, difficult to justify.</p>
<p>"There are no grounds to increase rates after December's inflation data...the central bank only wants to warn credit -takers not to take more," said Tadeusz Chroscicki, chief analyst at the government-linked Strategic Studies Centre.  </p>
<p>Last year credit to the non-financial sector increased by 43 percent, of which credit to households jumped an awesome 109 percent, causing the central bank to raise market rates around the turn of the year.</p>
<p>Broad money grew 29.0 percent in 1996, against a 31.5 rise in 1995, and surged 5.1 percent in December alone.</p>
<p>But according to the central bank almost half of last month's jump could be attributed to year-end factors and changes in account regulations.</p>
