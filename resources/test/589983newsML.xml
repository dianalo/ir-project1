<p>The Peruvian government presented Friday an improved set of economic indicators for 1997 in a provisional letter to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) outlining its annual goals.</p>
<p>The government forecast total 1997 investment would rise to 24.4 percent of gross domestic product from 23.5 percent last year.</p>
<p>It also predicted privatization revenues would reach $700 million this year, while the public sector deficit was projected to fall to 0.8 percent of GDP from 1.1 percent in 1996.  </p>
<p>Internal savings were seen up to 19.1 percent of GDP in 1997 from 17.7 percent last year.</p>
<p>The government's letter, addressed to IMF head Michel Camdessus, was published in the official daily El Peruano.</p>
<p>It invited suggestions and comments to the Economy Ministry within seven days before a final version is sent to the IMF.</p>
<p>The letter reiterated the government's goals to achieve five percent growth in 1997, up from 2.8 percent last year, and reduce inflation to between eight and ten percent from 11.8 percent in 1996.  </p>
<p>Last year's current account deficit of 5.8 percent of GDP was seen dropping to less than 5.5 percent of GDP in 1997.</p>
<p>The primary surplus will reach 1.3 percent from 1.1 percent last year, the letter added. Peru defines "primary surplus" as the difference between the government's spending, excluding interest payments on debt, and its income.</p>
<p>The letter, signed by Economy Minister Jorge Camet and Central Reserve Bank President German Suarez, said Peru's 1996 results were "in large part in line with the projections of the program." Peru signed last year a three-year macroeconomic target program with the IMF.  </p>
<p>"The government's program seeks to construct the conditions for sustained growth, with poverty reduction, less inflation and external viability," added the letter. "The program depends substantially on the continuation of fiscal and monetary discipline, and a deepening of structural reforms."</p>
<p>Social spending will increase to six percent of GDP in 1997 from three percent in 1991, the letter said.</p>
