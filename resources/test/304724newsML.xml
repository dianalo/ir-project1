<p>New York Gov. George Pataki on Tuesday disclosed his fiscal 1998 budget, estimating that captial spending would total $3.926 billion, a sum that would rise to $4.062 billion the next year.</p>
<p>The rise reflected a $661 million plan to build 7,000 new beds in three new prisons as well as expand additional prisons.</p>
<p>Further, the governor in his budget said he would seek to balance the state's debt profile by raising the use of short-term instruments by using more variable rate debt and interest rate exchange agreements.</p>
<p>Bond financing by public authorities was projected at 43 percent of capital spending in Pataki's five-year capital plan.</p>
<p>In fiscal 1998, the Administration said it expected bond issuance to total $2.556 billion, a level projected to rise to $2.955 billion in fiscal 1999, before declining to $2.657 billion by 2001-02.</p>
