<p>Pakistani opposition leader Nawaz Sharif said on Tuesday that the sacking of Benazir Bhutto's government was "deliverance for the people", and expressed confidence he would win general elections set for February.</p>
<p>"This day today is a day of deliverance for the people of Pakistan. The mismanagement of this government, the mishandling of this government is itself responsible for the situation which has arisen today," Sharif told Reuters after addressing supporters.  </p>
<p>Asked if he was confident his Pakistan Muslim League (PML) party would win general polls which President Farooq Leghari set for next February 3, Sharif said: "So far, yes, we are. Not only confident, but very confident, God willing."</p>
<p>Surrounded by a crowd of party workers, Sharif said Leghari had adhered to the constitution in dissolving the lower house of parliament and sacking Bhutto's government.</p>
<p>"I think the government should really have realised what it was up to, what it is doing, and should have tried to avoid the situation. I think it is the government which is responsible for inviting the situation," he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, in an Islamic gesture of thanksgiving, joyous PML activists slit the throat of a goat outside party headquarters.</p>
