<p>- Recent order signed by Moslem chairman of Bosnia's collective presidency, Alija Izetbegovic, and Croat member, Kresimir Zubak, on establishing the Moslem-Croat federation army resolves disputes between the partners in the army and boosts its development.</p>
<p>- Moslem co-prime minister in Bosnia's government, Haris Silajdzic, and his Serb counterpart Boro Bosic, are scheduled to meet World Bank officials and several U.S. senators during visit to Washington.</p>
<p>- Franjo Greguric, Croatian president's special envoy to Bosnian Moslem-Croat federation, is due to discuss economic and political issues with federation officials in Sarajevo.</p>
<p>- As for recent meeting between Serb and Croat nationalist parties in the Serb-controlled town of Banja Luka, secretary general of the ruling Moslem Party of Democratic Action (SDA), Mirsad Ceman, says if the talks contribute to the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement and development of Bosnia then his party has nothing against them.</p>
<p>OSLOBODJENJE</p>
<p>- British ministry of defence has just withdrawn the guide for British peacekeeping soldiers serving in Bosnia because of a number of mistakes contained in it, British ambassador to Bosnia, Charles Crawford, says. The guide shows former Yugoslavia as one country and does not mention Bosnian Moslems as its inhabitants.</p>
<p>- The European Commission, through its humanitarian organisation ECHO, plans to donate 156 million German marks to help the return of Bosnian refugees, ECHO officials say. -- Sarajevo newsroom, +387 71 663 864</p>
