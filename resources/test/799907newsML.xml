<p>Thousands of Indians gathered at the Wagah border post early on Friday to seek friendship with Pakistanis and found silence, emptiness and barbed wire on the other side.</p>
<p>Not a single person waved back at the sea of faces on the Indian side of the border on the 50th anniversary of the independence of the two arch-rivals who have fought three wars since the subcontinent was partitioned in 1947.</p>
<p>Nearly 10,000 Indians, who had braved a mild cane charge by harassed policemen and miles of traffic jams to light candles and torches for an intended spiritual reunion with Pakistanis, were disappointed.</p>
<p>"Pakistan has badly snubbed us. I think it was very stupid on our part to think that they will come with the same enthusiasm to stand in amity with us," said Tejinder Singh, a civil engineer from the nearby town of Amritsar.</p>
<p>"There is no sharing of feeling," said Sarabh Jyoti Singh, a professor at Gurunanak Dev University in the northern Indian state of Punjab.</p>
<p>India, secular but largely Hindu, won independence from British rule on August 15, 1947, a day after the formation of mainly Moslem Pakistan.</p>
<p>Relations between the two countries have never been easy since at least half a million people were killed in bloody riots accompanying partition. Six million Hindus and Sikhs fled to India and as many Moslems went to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Human rights activists of Citizens for Democracy (CFD), the key organiser of a cultural show and campaign seeking friendship with Pakistan, lit torches on the border in front of an iron gate painted in India's national colours.</p>
<p>They carried portraits of independence leaders Bhagat Singh and Chandra Shekhar Azad and chanted slogans calling for friendship between India and Pakistan.</p>
<p>Flags of the two nations fluttered a mere eight metres (yards) from each other as border guards looked on impassively. The Pakistani side was dimly lit and silent.</p>
<p>"It is like a one-sided love affair, I think we were just deluding ourselves," said Gurcharan Singh Cheema, a doctor who came with his wife and seven-year-old daughter from the Punjab state capital Chandigarh.</p>
<p>The Indian road leading to the border post was decorated with golden and silver tinsel tied to electric poles.</p>
<p>CFD activists said they were very disappointed with the lack of response from Pakistan. "I thought there will be people from the other side, we'll wave at each other and maybe exchange a few words," said Jeena Singh, an architect.</p>
<p>Jyoti Singh said: "They could have broken us into manageable groups of five people or so and then let those groups go to the no-man's land and maybe exchange a few words. That would have strengthened the feeling of belonging to each other."</p>
<p>"I am quite disappointed by this farce," said Saroj Trehan, who was born in Lahore in what is now Pakistan. "I thought that I will see some people from Lahore, but now I feel it was all wishful thinking, reality is quite different."</p>
<p>Trehan was seven years old when she left her dolls in an unlocked house in Lahore, hoping to collect them the following week. That week never came.</p>
