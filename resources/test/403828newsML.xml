<p>South African President Nelson Mandela, driving an African initiative for peace in eastern Zaire, will meet Zairean rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Johannesburg on Wednesday, a spokesman said.</p>
<p>"The President will meet Kabila at his house in Johannesburg just to shake hands -- for a very, very general discussion," presidential spokesman Parks Mankahlana told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>Mandela, just back from Botswana where he attended a Commonwealth policy meeting on governance in Africa, was expected to travel to his Johannesburg home to meet Kabila later on Wednesday, Mankahlana said.</p>
<p>He said Mandela remained committed to an early meeting with Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko, but probably would travel to Zaire with other African leaders for the talks.</p>
<p>"His idea is that a delegation of heads of state should go to Zaire to meet President Mobutu there," Mankahlana said.</p>
<p>Mandela told reporters earlier this week he hoped to meet Mobutu in Kenya or Zaire on March 19. Officials said this date had however not been confirmed.</p>
<p>Mankahlana said Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad, who on Wednesday anchored proximity talks involving Kabila, briefed Mandela at the Waterkloof military airbase near Pretoria.</p>
<p>Diplomats said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State George Moose, who is visiting South Africa, also met Kabila on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials declined to say whether Pahad was able to report progress to Mandela, who last week announced a new South African-led initiative for peace in Zaire, where the government is fighting ethnic Tutsi rebels.</p>
<p>Mankahlana said Mandela, who leaves for Southeast Asia on Friday, wanted to give his personal encouragement to the peace process, about which officials and diplomats have so far remained tight-lipped.</p>
<p>"The President expressed the wish to meet Kabila and shake his hand. The President is not going to go into any hard discussion.</p>
<p>"The intention is to encourage Kabila to play the role that President Mandela believes he is capable of playing in Zaire. Kabila is obviously a very important player," he said.</p>
<p>Kabila's rebels, many of them Zairean Tutsis whose ethnic kin control neighbouring Rwanda and Burundi, took up arms last October and have overrun a swath of east Zaire's borderlands.</p>
<p>The conflict, which escalated this month with the aerial bombing of rebel-held towns, has sent tens of thousands of refugees fleeing and threatens to destabilise Zaire and its Central African neighbours.</p>
