<p>Briggs &amp; Stratton Corp said a decline in sales and a widening of its loss in the first quarter ended September 30 were due to customers' plans to build lawn and garden equipment later than they did last year.</p>
<p>Engine shipments fell 20 percent in the quarter, the engine maker said.</p>
<p>"We are concerned that, despite good late season retail sales, inventories could be somewhat higher than they were a year ago," chief executive F.P. Stratton Jr said in an news release.  "Nevertheless, we continue to believe that, if the weather cooperates, we should have a good year."</p>
<p>The company also said the majority of the expense of moving its Menomonee Falls manufacturing operations to available space in our Wauwatosa plant will be recognized in the second quarter. The sale of the Menomonee Falls facility was completed just after the quarter end, but the gain on the sale will be postponed until the company's interest in the warehouse potion of the facility ends.</p>
<p>Earlier, the company reported a net loss of $5.3 million, or $0.18 a share in the quarter, compared to a loss of 43.3 million, or $0.11 a share a year ago.</p>
