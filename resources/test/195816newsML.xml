<p>Most European Union countries are expected to fall short of the economic targets set for currency union but politicians are likely to bend the rules to keep the birth of the euro on track, Reuters surveys showed on Monday.</p>
<p>A continent-wide poll of 34 banks and institutions gauging each states' ability to meet the demands of economic and monetary union (EMU) showed that if entry criteria were strictly applied, only Luxembourg would make it.</p>
<p>But despite the economic shortfalls, a separate survey of 41 economists and think-tanks showed an 82 percent likelihood of a single currency being launched in Europe on the scheduled start date of January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>The surveys were carried out over a two-day period last week, taking in economic experts in banks, research institutions and universities across all 15 EU member states.</p>
<p>In one survey, respondents were asked the likelihood of EMU going ahead in some form on the scheduled date of January 1, 1999, and which countries would be in that first wave.</p>
<p>Those in the second poll were asked to rate how each country was shaping up to meet the economic targets set under the 1992 Maastricht Treaty to qualify for the single currency club.</p>
<p>"The closer we get to EMU the more obvious it is that it is going to be a political decision and not a Maastricht criteria decision," said Brian Venables, senior bond strategist at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Under the Maastricht Treaty, states wanting to take part in currency union must fulfil five criteria during 1997 indicating robust economic health.</p>
<p>These are a debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio of less than 60 percent, a budget deficit lower than three percent of GDP, low inflation, low long-term interest rates and two years of exemplary membership of the existing currency grid.</p>
<p>Countries expected to take part in the first wave of EMU are France, Germany, Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, with Finland and Ireland being strong outside bets, the survey showed. These findings indicate little change from a poll conducted a month ago.</p>
<p>The debt criterion was shaping up to be the most difficult for countries to attain. According to the survey, only Britain, Luxembourg and France would make it.</p>
<p>The other four criteria were being approached more easily, with six out of the 15 countries -- Denmark, Finland, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Sweden -- likely to have their ratio of public sector deficit to GDP under the required three percent during 1997.</p>
<p>Every EU member except Greece would have their inflation and bond yield rates within the guidelines, according to the findings of the survey conducted between November 11 and 13.</p>
<p>Much of the impetus towards EMU lies with France and Germany, according to the economists.</p>
<p>"The French and Germans are steam-rollering the process through, effectively leading the pack. The political power is lying with the big pair," said Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist at BankAmerica in London.</p>
<p>But despite their enthusiasm, both France and Germany would just fail the Maastricht litmus test on levels of budget deficit and under the strict terms of the treaty Germany would also falter because of its debt burden.</p>
<p>Economists pointed out that the rules for entry to the currency club were drawn up in such as way as to make such near-misses eligible.</p>
<p>"The Maastricht criteria were built with flexibility in mind. There was never an intenion for the countries to hit them or be damned. There is nothing sacrosanct about them," said Nigel Richardson, international economist at Yamaichi in London.</p>
<p>Nowhere are the political considerations for entry more paramount than in Britain, where the economy is in good shape to meet the EMU criteria, according to the survey.</p>
<p>But Britain's ruling Conservatives, facing a general election by May next year and trailing in opinion polls, are divided over the country's role in Europe. They are committed to consulting Britons in a referendum before joining EMU.</p>
<p>The opposition Labour party, favourite to take power after the election, said at the weekend that if it won it, too, would hold a referendum before taking Britain in.</p>
