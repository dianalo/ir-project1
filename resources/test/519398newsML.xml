<p>French car manufacturer PSA Peugeot Citroen said as it announced a tumble in 1996 profit on Thursday that the overall French car market could see sales drop by 11 to 12 percent this year.</p>
<p>"The fierce competition raging in Europe does not look like going away," it said in a results statement.</p>
<p>The statement announced a drop in net attributable profit to 734 million francs from a profit of 1.7 billion the previous year and a net dividend cut to three francs per share from five francs.</p>
<p>"The Western European car market should see overall growth of close to two percent in 1997 but the depression of the French market since autmumn 1996 has continued unabated and sales could recede by 11-12 percent over the year," it said.</p>
<p>As far as Peugeot itself was concerned, the company said: "Nevertheless, bolstered by the success of its car range, notably in the light commercial vehicles sector, PSA Peugeot Citroen sales should meet the target gains which the group has set itself".</p>
