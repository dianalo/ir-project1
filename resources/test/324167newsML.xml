<p>South Africa's government deferred a decision on Wednesday on a controversial but lucrative arms sale to Syria that could lead to the United States cutting off aid.</p>
<p>Cabinet secretary Jakes Gerwel said the cabinet, meeting with President Nelson Mandela, postponed a decision on the sale of weapons technology to Damascus, pending further discussions.</p>
<p>The matter would not necessarily be finalised when the cabinet met again in two weeks, Gerwel told a news conference.</p>
<p>Minutes leaked earlier this month showed the cabinet had already given provisional approval to the sale, pending the approval of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who was absent from a discussion on the matter last month.</p>
<p>He has so far declined to voice an opinion on the merits of weapons deals with Syria, but joined Mandela in taking a defiant stand in the face of warnings from Washington, saying South Africa would not bow to outside pressure.</p>
<p>The United States has threatened to cut off aid over the proposed contract to provide tank-gun aiming systems to the Damascus government, which Washington regards as a state sponsor of terrorism -- a charge Syria denies.</p>
<p>South Africa says several states, including three unnamed European countries, are bidding for the $650 million deal, and asserts that a U.S. defence contractor is involved in at least one of the bids.</p>
<p>Defence analysts say any major NATO power has the technology to produce the equipment, which would improve and modernise the targeting ability of Soviet-built T-72 tanks, of which Syria has well over 1,000.</p>
<p>The electronic system provides computerised control of the mechanism that aims and fires the cannon in tanks and howitzers, making them many times more accurate -- something that has raised fears in Syria's arch-foe and neighbour, Israel.</p>
<p>While Washington says it would have no option but to cut off aid worth $110 million this year if the deal went ahead, South Africa in turn accuses the United States of hypocrisy for not acting against the U.S. contractor bidding for the deal.</p>
<p>The opposition National Party of former president F.W. de Klerk has urged Pretoria to veto the sale, saying it goes against Mandela's government's own guidelines on not selling arms to troublespots.</p>
<p>The previous white government had close military ties with Israel. Mbeki told a weekend news briefing South Africa would no longer favour Israel over Arab states, but would seek to maintain a more "balanced" policy towards the volatile region.</p>
<p>The Arab market is a potential goldmine for South Africa's sales-hungry arms industry, and Syria could unlock it. Slowly recovering from years of international sanctions, the country's armaments export market was worth only some one billion rand ($216 million) in the year to September 30.</p>
<p>South African defence companies are to show their wares at an international defence exhibition at Abu Dhabi in March, an expo seen as the showplace for potential buyers in the Middle East, south-east Asia and the Far East.</p>
