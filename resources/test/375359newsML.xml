<p>Peru's top Roman Catholic priest has urged the MRTA rebels holding 72 hostages at the Japanese ambassador's home to end the "agony" of the siege, after the rebels and government raised hopes by agreeing to negotiate.</p>
<p>Although there was no official word on when talks would resume, local media speculated it could be this weekend.</p>
<p>But Cardinal Augusto Vargas Alzamora on Wednesday exhorted the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement to end their 58-day siege immediately and "to say 'we renounce holding them any longer.'"</p>
<p>"Peru would applaud their example. But if they prolong this agony any longer, Peru will repudiate them," he told reporters.</p>
<p>President Alberto Fujimori returned home on Wednesday from a visit to London, a day after his negotiator Domingo Palermo and MRTA second-in-command Rolly Rojas agreed in preliminary talks at a Red Cross safe house to begin negotiations.</p>
<p>The language that guarantors from the Vatican and Canada used to describe the breakthrough was cautious, saying there was an agreement on "the procedures to follow in future conversations ... at a date yet to be set."</p>
<p>But it was the first time rebels and the government had met since Dec. 28, when Education Minister Palermo met Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, head of the 15 rebels who stormed the residence during a cocktail party on Dec. 17 and seized over 500 guests.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department, viewing it as a "positive step" toward a peaceful solution, said: "The fact that they, after so many weeks, have arrived at the point where they can talk to each other directly in a rational way is a strong indicator that a peaceful solution is possible."</p>
<p>Japan's Foreign Ministry said it hoped the talks "will pave the way for the start of full negotiations so that the incident can be solved peacefully and the hostages freed early."</p>
<p>Japan has urged Fujimori to seek a peaceful outcome, but there is also strong endorsement from U.S. President Bill Clinton among others for his refusal to consider the MRTA's main demand -- the release of 400 comrades from Peruvian jails.</p>
<p>"The United States does not believe that terrorists should succeed and we do not believe that concessions should be made to them," U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns commented on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Fujimori's own brother and a brother-in-law are among the 72 remaining VIP hostages, who also include two government ministers, the ambassadors of Japan and Bolivia and about two dozen Japanese businessmen.</p>
<p>As the tight security and tension around the residence relaxed a little in the wake of Tuesday's breakthrough, about half a dozen Japanese hostages emerged into the garden and donned rubber gloves to clean up the two-month-old debris of the diplomatic cocktail party that the MRTA interrupted.</p>
<p>The Red Cross, which has rented a house opposite the residence for negotiations, continued to ferry in food to the residence and stock up medical supplies, including wheelchairs.</p>
<p>There was encouraging evidence that for tourists at least, the rebel siege in Lima is not seen as a threat. Peru's Inca ruins and Andean scenery have begun to regain popularity with tourists since guerrilla violence began diminishing in 1992.</p>
<p>Government data released on Wednesay showed the number of tourists visiting Peru since the siege began has actually risen by more than 13 percent over a year earlier.</p>
<p>The marketing group PromPeru said that after initial fears, "it began to be understood internationally that the events at the Japanese ambassador's residence are an isolated case that does not affect the security of visitors."</p>
<p>More than 600,000 tourists visited Peru in 1996.</p>
