<p>In a revealing display of political loyalties, delegates at the Mexican ruling party's convention jeered and booed U.S. observers on Sunday but cheered the Cuban Communist Party ecstatically.</p>
<p>As the moderator read out a list of "fraternal delegates" from other countries to the Institutional Revolutionary Party's (PRI) National Assembly, rank-and-file militants cheered their greetings.</p>
<p>El Salvador's Farabundo Marti Liberation Front -- a former Marxist guerrilla group -- Nicaragua's Sandinistas, China's Communist Party and even Canada's Parti Quebecois all won applause.</p>
<p>But when PRI delegates heard the U.S. Republican and Democratic parties mentioned, the cheers turned to jeers, catcalls and whistling.</p>
<p>Founded in the aftermath of the 1910-1917 Mexican Revolution, the PRI has traditionally been a bastion of anti-American nationalism.</p>
<p>Although PRI government ministers regularly sit down for friendly talks with their American counterparts, rank-and-file militants retain their traditional suspicion of the "Colossus of the North."</p>
