<headline>FOCUS-Euro stocks surge to highs, dollar stalls.</headline>

<p>European stock markets surged to new highs on Thursday, boosted by favourable U.S. retail sales figures, but the dollar largely ignored the American data.</p>
<p>German ended bourse trade at a fresh record, French shares struck a trading high and London rose strongly after Wall Street leapt 1.5 percent on Wednesday to a record 6,961.63 points.</p>
<p>As Wall Street reopend the Dow industrials average rose 20 points in the first 10 minutes of trade, but it later slipped back .</p>
<p>Foreign exchange markets were dominated in early trade by worries that the central banks of the main industrialised countries could intervene to cap the dollar's surging value.</p>
<p>The vice-president of the German Bundesbank, Wilhelm Gaddum, said overnight it was not in the bank's interest to see the dollar strengthen further, echoing a similar statement from the central bank on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Generally speaking, the attitude is that on the basis of fundamentals the dollar will continue to move higher," said Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist for Europe at BankAmerica here. "But perhaps recent comments haven't helped the pace at which it could appreciate."</p>
<p>Fears of intervention have grown following the recent meeting of the Group of Seven industrialised nations, at which the market perceived Japan to be least pleased with the dollar's strength.</p>
<p>As U.S. markets opened the dollar was trading marginally lower following the release of the U.S. retail sales figures.</p>
<p>Sales rose 0.6 percent in January, but December was revised downward to a 0.3 percent gain from a previously reported 0.6 percent. January's 0.6 percent increase was slightly less than forecasts of a 0.7 percent gain.</p>
<p>The currency market will see these numbers as perhaps reducing the chance the Federal Reserve will alter monetary policy, said Mark Gargano, managing director of currency derivatives at First Union National Bank.</p>
<p>"It's just one number but it doesn't give me any impression that the Fed would be aggressively tightening in March," Gargano said. "If anything, it'll probably take a little steam out of the dollar but not much."</p>
<p>By 1500 GMT the dollar was holding its own at 1.6839 marks and 124.19 yen compared with 1.6820 marks and 123.81 yen in late European trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>European bond markets kicked off the day in a chirpy mood, but British government gilts retreated after stronger than expected inflation data and German bund futures also pared gains after sprinting to an all-time high.</p>
<p>Wall Street's overnight gains, propelled by the strength of the dollar and powerful inflows into U.S. mutual funds, set the tone for another bullish day in Asian and European stock markets.</p>
<p>In Tokyo the Nikkei rose 1.5 percent to 18,688 while European investors saw France and Germany hit fresh peaks.</p>
<p>German shares continued their record-setting advance with the 30-share DAX index hitting a fresh closing high of 3,229.48 points in floor trade. In later screen-based trading the IBIS DAX was up 22 points at 3,233 points.</p>
<p>Traders said the market found support from export sensitive shares, including carmakers such as Volkswagen AG, which ended up 15.5 marks at 818 marks, and BMW.</p>
<p>French shares struck a new trading record of 2,631.89 in early trade but then slipped after briefly spiking up on the U.S. figures.</p>
<p>Dealers said shares were supported by Wall Street, a strong dollar and firm bond prices.</p>
<p>Generale des Eaux was off its highs but still 3.87 percent higher on news it had been selected as industrial partner by railways operator SNCF to run its telecommunications network. This deal strengthens Generale des Eaux' Cegetel telecoms unit ahead of full competition with France Telecom in 1998.</p>
<p>Europe's largest stock market, London, rose strongly in early trade but fell short of the record-breaking performance of its main rivals.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 came to a halt at 4,329.9, just 0.1 points below its all-time high. The index turned on its heels and retreated to 4,322 BY 1500 GMT, still 18 points up on the day.</p>
<p>Retail Price Index (RPI) data showed inflation slightly higher than expected but analysts said a near-term interest rate rise was still extremely unlikely and the FTSE ignored the news.</p>
<p>Dealers said sentiment remained firm and annual results from Shell Transport and Trading Co Plc underpinned the positive tone along with news of a possible bid approach for Chubb Security Plc.</p>
<p>"The inflation figures are out of the way, the one set of big company results were no problem, and we've had the all-important ingredient of a bid approach," a trader said. "It's all looking right today."</p>
