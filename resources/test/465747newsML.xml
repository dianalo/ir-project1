<p>Russia expressed concern on Tuesday about problems facing Russian journalists in Belarus, one of Moscow's closest allies, and urged Minsk to guarantee media freedom.</p>
<p>Belarus authorities began a crackdown on foreign television broadcasters on Sunday, stopping journalists from entering the main television centre where they usually transmit coverage of the former Soviet republic.</p>
<p>"The very fact that Russian television channels have been denied the right to send information materials from Minsk prompts deep concern in the Kremlin," Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news conference.</p>
<p>"We have the right to expect that the principles of freedom of information will be restored in full and that Russian journalists will get the possibility to to fulfil their professional duties without obstacles," he added.</p>
<p>But Yastrzhembsky also urged Russian reporters to operate within the law.</p>
<p>"At the same time, we call on Russian mass media, accredited in Belarus, to act in a sovereign state within the law, to preserve the rules of objectivity and lack of bias," he said.</p>
<p>Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko has accused foreign reporters of biased reporting on recent opposition protests in Belarus which led to a series of clashes and arrests.</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Russia's commercial television channel NTV asked Moscow to intervene into the case of NTV's Minsk correspondent Alexander Stupnikov, whose accreditation was removed by the Belarussian foreign ministry on Monday.</p>
<p>An NTV statement called on Russian government to "stop the persecutions of Russian journalists in Belarus."</p>
<p>It called the withdrawal of Stupnikov's accreditation an "act of arbitrariness and brutal violation of the freedom of information...The atack on Russian mass media in Belarus has systematic and challenging nature," the statement said.</p>
<p>In a further sign of a media crackdown, the press secretary for the prime minister told a news briefing on Monday that Minsk was banning the import and export of certain materials.</p>
<p>The ban applied to "all audio, video and text material which could damage the political or economic interests of the country," the press secretary, Dmitry Malynovsky, said.</p>
<p>The decree, due to have legal force in a month after beeing published, has not appeared in the official media so far.</p>
<p>The order, by the government, appeared to be aimed at opposition newspapers which are printed abroad.</p>
<p>At least three independent Belarus newspapers are published in Lithuania. They include twice-wekly Belarusskaya Delovaya Gazeta newspaper, daily Narodnaya Volya and weekly Imya. Several smaller opposition newspapers are also fully or partly printed in Lithuania.</p>
<p>For several days the three main Russian channels have shown no pictures from Belarus -- only audio reports.</p>
