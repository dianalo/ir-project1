<p>The Atlanta Braves, behind Tom Glavine's strong pitching and Chipper Jones' two-run homer, reached their fifth straight National League Championship Series on a 5-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers Saturday.</p>
<p>The Braves once again used strong pitching and the long ball to complete a three-game division series sweep of the Dodgers. Atlanta hit five homers in the three games and held Los Angeles to just five runs.</p>
<p>The Braves jumped on Los Angeles starter Hideo Nomo for five runs, five hits and five walks in 3-2/3 innings. Nomo had dominated the Braves in three regular season starts, going 2-0 with a 1.61 ERA in 22-1/3 innings.</p>
<p>Glavine scattered five hits and three walks while striking out seven in 6-2/3 innings. Mark Wohlers retired all four batters he faced and saved every game of the series.</p>
<p>"I was borderline," Glavine said, but "my changeup was good today."</p>
<p>Asked his reaction to reaching the NLCS again, he said: "I was surprised. The margin of error is very small."</p>
