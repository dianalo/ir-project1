<p>The Brazilian Progressive Party (PPB), whose votes are crucial to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's second term plan, began a one-day convention to decide its position on the issue of re-election, a party official said.</p>
<p>The PPB, one of the largest parties in Congress, was likely to declare itself against re-election but would allow deputies and senators to vote as they chose on the issue, the official said.</p>
<p>"I think the PPB will emerge united, recommending that the party votes against re-election and leaving it up to members to vote according to their conscience," he said.  </p>
<p>The official denied the party was split on the re-election issue.</p>
<p>But observers saw conflict between two PPB bigwigs Paulo Maluf, the outgoing Sao Paulo mayor who wants to stop re-election to help his own presidential plan, and Industry and Commerce Minister Francisco Dornelles, a supporter of Cardoso's re-election.</p>
<p>Newspaper Gazeta Mercantil on Wednesday said Maluf would not insist at the convention that the PPB oblige its members to vote against a constitutional amendment allowing re-election when it reaches the floor of the lower house in January.</p>
<p>But Maluf would probably seek to guarantee the PPB's total opposition to the amendment closer to the vote, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The PPB, allied with the Liberal Party, has 97 members of the 513-strong Chamber of Deputies. The government needs two majorities of 308 votes each for the amendment to be approved in the lower house.</p>
