<p>HOWARD SAYS HANSON RACE ISSUE WILL FADE AWAY</p>
<p>Prime Minister, John Howard, has denied reports of disquiet within the Coalition about his approach to the debate on race and immigration.</p>
<p>The Anglican Bishop for Canberra and Goulburn, Bishop George Browning, has said Liberals have expressed dissatisfaction to him about the Prime Minister's handling of the debate.</p>
<p>But Mr Howard has told the Coalition party room the suggestion is totally false.</p>
<p>He says he's sure, and has been convinced by his colleagues, his attitude to the debate is right.</p>
<p>Mr Howard has also expressed a belief the debate will die out, likening it to a meteorite which sails through the firmament and then disappears.</p>

<p>VARIETY IS SPICE OF LIFE IN QUARANTINE SERVICE</p>
<p>Melbourne Cup starter, Oscar Schindler, and two bongo antelopes were among the most unusual animals the Quarantine service approved for entry to Australia in October.</p>
<p>The service seized a half-metre long python found in an international aircraft in Adelaide, a pig's ear found in baggage and a dried bull's penis mailed to a woman from overseas.</p>
<p>In its October report, the Quarantine Service says it also dealt with a cricket which had caused havoc by attaching itself to a passenger's head during an international flight to Sydney.</p>
<p>The service took a range of court action, including against a student who was fined nearly 15-hundred dollars for importing fruit, meat and eggs and a manager fined the same amount for illegally importing mangoes in an airline carry-on bag.</p>

<p>CALLS FOR INVESTIGATION INTO TOWNSVILLE ATTACK</p>
<p>In north Queensland, Townsville Mayor Tony Mooney has called on police to investigate allegations an Aboriginal Police Liaison Officer watched while two Japanese students were assaulted.</p>
<p>Councillor Mooney says the weekend incident was captured on a security camera, now being examined by police.</p>
<p>He says after the assault, the attacker gave what appears to be a High Five salute to a nearby Police Liaison Officer.</p>
<p>Councillor Mooney says that's disgraceful behaviour given PLOs are there to ensure safety, to liaise with the community and make a safer public environment.</p>

<p>CALL FOR STAY OF PROCEEDINS FOR GARIBALDI DEFENDANT</p>
<p>A former director of Garibaldi Smallgoods has asked the Supreme Court in Adelaide to put-off a manslaughter charge against him  because he can't afford legal representation.</p>
<p>Neville Mead, who was financial controller of the now-defunct company, is applying for a stay of proceedings.</p>
<p>He says the charge is too serious for him to represent himself,</p>
<p>He's too poor to pay lawyers and has been refused legal aid. Neville Mead is jointly charged with Luciano and Philip Marchi over the death of four-year-old Nikki Robinson ... who died in a contaminated mettwurst epidemic last year.</p>

<p>NSW OPPOSITION LEADER WANTS TRUTH ABOUT YELDHAM</p>
<p>The New South Wales Opposition has called on the Police Royal Commission to release details of its inquiries into Justice David Yeldham after his suicide yesterday.</p>
<p>The call echoes that of Labor M-P Franca Arena, who raised questions in Parliament about the Commission's investigations into the judge before his death.</p>
<p>Mrs Arena's remained strident in her calls for the Royal Commission to reveal what, if anything, its inquiries turned up. Opposition Leader, Peter Collins, says Mrs Arena was guilty of a dreadful abuse of Parliamentary privilege in naming Justice Yeldham.</p>
<p>But Mr Collins says the Royal Commission must now reveal the results of its investigation of Justice Yeldham, for the sake of his family.</p>
