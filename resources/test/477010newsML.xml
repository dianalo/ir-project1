<p>Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund ended one of its worst fiscal years ever on Monday, looking more like a growth fund but still lagging its peers, analysts said.</p>
<p>Magellan returned 8.99 percent over the last six months, ranking it 420 out of 545 large-cap blend funds, versus 15.28 percent for the S&amp;P 500, according to Morningstar Mutual Funds.</p>
<p>Over the last year, Magellan returned 11.62 percent for a ranking of 502 out of 527 of its peers, against 23.11 percnet for the index, Morningstar said.  </p>
<p>Since portfolio manager Bob Stansky took over from Jeff Vinik in June last year, he has sold off the fund's huge position in bonds and bought stocks in an array of sectors.</p>
<p>"I think that Stansky has positioned the fund where he wants it now," said Eric Kobren, publisher of the independent publication Fidelity Insight.</p>
<p>"He's a diversified, large-cap growth fund now that's not weighted in any one particular industry. So I think he'll be much closer to the benchmark from here on out," Kobren added.</p>
<p>As of Jan. 31, 14.6 percent of the fund was invested in technology shares, another 14.6 percent in energy, and more than six percent was in finance, durables, industrial machinery and equipment and healthcare, according to company reports.  </p>
<p>Fidelity is one of the few fund companies that has management fees that fluctuate automatically according to performance compared with the S&amp;P 500 over the last 36 months.</p>
<p>Magellan's management fee was cut to 0.47 percent on September 30 from 0.73 percent at the end of fiscal year 1996 and could be cut further, analsyts said.</p>
<p>Kobren noted that about 85 percent of mutual funds have been unable beat the strong performance of the S&amp;P 500 over the last year.</p>
<p>"While that was done with the good intentions of shareholders in mind, I think it had a downside on morale," Kobren said of the performance adjustment on fees. "I think that actually has played a part in some people leaving."</p>
<p>Fidelity has gone through a barrage of fund manager changes over the last year, but Kobren said he expected more stability this year.</p>
<p>"I think they will make every effort to keep the fund managers where they are," he said. "They don't want to make any wholesale changes."</p>
