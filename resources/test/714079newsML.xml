<p>LIFFE robusta coffee futures rebounded from early lows on roaster price-fixing to end Tuesday midsession higher but within pre-opening expectations.</p>
<p>Traders said price movements remained small with the market still struggling to move out of its dull and familiar range.</p>
<p>September gapped $20 higher as expected but moved to a low of $1,762 a tonne before finishing midday $13 up at $1,790.</p>
<p>Traders said the market had been trapped within a $100 price band for the past week amid little exciting news .</p>
<p>"There's some buying at $50 below and selling at $50 higher than current levels," said one.</p>
<p>Volume reached just 1,554 lots.</p>
<p>Traders called the New York market to open about unchanged.</p>
<p>Chartwise, the market was waiting for a break on either side. Analysts said if anything, there's a little pressure on the downside.</p>
<p>Initial support is seen at $1,755, Monday's low, followed by the June 11 low of $1,695.</p>
<p>A break of $1,695 would see a move down to $1,550, the lows not seen since early April.</p>
<p>In other news, the next Brazilian auction of government coffee stocks is now likely to be held on July 15 or July 16, said the secretary-general of the Brazilian Coffee Industry Association (Abic) which represents roasters.</p>
<p>The monthly sale was originally scheduled to be held on July 2 but was postponed pending the official publication of an extension in the payment terms to 120 days from a previous 60 days, said David Nahum.</p>
<p>On the weather front, the private forecaster Weather Services Corp said no damaging cold was in sight for the next five days in Brazil's coffee growing regions.</p>
