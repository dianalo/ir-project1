<headline>Lincoln National considers unit sale - sources.</headline>

<p>Lincoln National Corp is considering a possible sale of its American States Financial Corp property-casualty insurance unit, sources familiar with the situation said.</p>
<p>The sources said Goldman Sachs has been sounding out potential acquirors, but said that they believed the process was in its early stages and that the company's financial books have not yet gone out to prospective buyers.</p>
<p>Lincoln National declined comment.  But the company previously did not rule out a possible sale of its 83 percent-owned American States unit.  </p>
<p>American States, which has a market value of nearly $2 billion based on its share price and the number of shares outstanding, was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs also was not immediately available.</p>
<p>Potential acquirors could include Travelers Property Casualty Corp, CNA Financial Corp and Liberty Mutual Insurance Co, as well as some foreign insurers, such as Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV, Aegon NV and Fortis AG, the sources said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, SAFECO Corp also was rumored to be a possible acquiror.  </p>
<p>Travelers Property Casualty and CNA Financial declined comment. Liberty Mutual was not immediately available for comment. SAFECO previously declined comment.</p>
<p>Shares of American States have rallied over the last month or so on speculation that the company might be for sale.</p>
<p>The speculation picked up steam late last month after ReliaStar Financial Corp agreed to buy former Lincoln National holding Security-Connecticut Corp.  </p>
<p>That was the third former Lincoln National holding to be sold in the last two years, prompting many in the industry to believe that Lincoln National would not hold on to American States for too long either.</p>
<p>However, some industry sources said they believed Lincoln National might have a hard time finding a buyer for American States following the runup in the price of the stock.</p>
<p>One source said that at about $32 a share, American States is trading at 1.5 times book value, a level that may be a bit rich for some buyers.</p>
<p>He said he doubted that a disciplined buyer would be interested because the deal would probably be dilutive because of the substantial goodwill and a lack of earnings power.</p>
