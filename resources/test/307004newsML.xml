<p>Dresdner Kleinwort Benson analyst Charles Manso said he was reviewing his recommendation of Saint Louis and could possibly upgrade his "hold" rating after the food group bought a 15 percent stake in Ebro Agricolas.</p>
<p>"This is the second bit of good news in two days. We have to factor that in. I think today's deal is slightly earnings enhancing," Manso said.</p>
<p>On Monday, Saint Louis said it was closing its Bresles sugar plant as part of a rationalisation of its production structure.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning it said its Generale Sucriere holding had bought the Ebro stake from Banco Santander.  </p>
<p>Saint Louis already has a 20.35 percent stake in Sociedad General de Azucarera de Espana (Azucarera), Spain's second largest sugar group.</p>
<p>Ebro and Azucarera are planning to merge their operations.</p>
<p>Saint Louis chairman Daniel Melin said in December that he aimed for a 20 to 25 percent stake in the merged company.</p>
<p>Kleinwort's Manso said he would not be surprised if Saint Louis were to take a majority in the future.</p>
<p>"The new management has been in place for 18 months now and they are doing the right things," Manso said.</p>
<p>In November, Saint Louis sold its Royal Champignon mushroom unit to Champi-Jandou and it has made provisions for restructuring at its 40 percent paper unit Arjo Wiggins Appleton .</p>
<p>Melin, a former head of construction group Spie Batignolles, was named chairman and chief executive at Saint Louis in May 1995 after Bernard Dumon had died in a plane crash in January.</p>
<p>Bank Worms et Cie has 27.8 percent in Saint Louis and Italy's IFIL Spa, a finance company controlled by the Agnelli family, has a 25.9 percent stake.</p>
<p>At 1015 GMT, Saint Louis shares were up 0.83 percent at 1,338 francs.</p>
