<p>New York City on Wednesday won a round of a battle to push most pornorgraphic shops out of tourist and other areas, as a state judge upheld a new zoning code that would largely restrict them to industrial areas.</p>
<p>State Supreme Court Judge Marylin Diamond rejected the industry's charge that its free speech rights, which are protected in the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, were violated by the city's new code.</p>
<p>"Those seeking to patronize adult establishments will be able to continue to beat a path to their doors," she wrote in her opinion.</p>
<p>The ruling clears the way for the city to enforce the law, which goes into effect on Saturday. Paul Crotty, the New York City corporate counsel, said the law would be vigorously enforced by using summons from the department of buildings and by applying the nuisance abatement law.</p>
<p>The president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, Gretchen Dykstra, has said that the new law will help reduce the number of pornographic shops in this tourist area to around six or seven, a big improvement.</p>
<p>However, the attorney for the adult entertainment industry, Herald Price Fahringer, said he would ask the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court for an emergency order to block the city from enforcing the new zoning law.</p>
<p>"What is disappointing is that Justice Diamond would say there are available sites for the book stores and theatres to relocate to, when they're talking about the wetlands of Staten Island, oil tank farms and warehouses on the west side (of Manhattan)," Fahringer told reporters.</p>
<p>"It's really preposterous," he added.</p>
