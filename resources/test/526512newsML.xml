<p>Shanghai's B share index was up sharply at midday on Monday due to strong sentiment after the market's substantial rise over the past two weeks, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B index surged 3.065 points or 3.63 percent to 87.582 points on volume of 30.284 million shares worth $14.786 million, compared with $13.606 million on Friday.</p>
<p>The recent strong gains were supported by a fundamental improvement in China's economy as well as by the performance of individual listed firms, and further rises are expected if volume continues to pick up in the afternoon, brokers said.  </p>
<p>The central bank last week set the May anti-inflation subsidy at zero.</p>
<p>"Both overseas and domestic investors have strong confidence in the market outlook and fresh capital is flowing in," one broker said.</p>
<p>"But most listed firms whose results are expected to be poor have yet to issue their 1996 reports, which is a negative factor for the market," he said.</p>
<p>Of 43 B shares, 41 traded and they all rose.  </p>
<p>Shanghai Vacuum and Electron Device, the most actively traded counter, was the star after its recently announced financial restructuring, surging $0.024 or 9.75 percent to $0.270 on volume of 2.0 million shares.</p>
<p>Wing Sung followed on speculative buying, jumping $0.026 or 8.55 percent to $0.330 on volume of 10,000 shares.</p>
<p>The Shanghai A share index continued to rise on bullish market sentiment, brokers said.</p>
<p>It gained 24.220 points or 1.73 percent to 1,423.826 points on volume of 549.9 million shares worth 6.3 billion yuan.  </p>
<p>The SSE30 index put on 79.734 points or 2.22 percent to 3,676.021 points.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Paper was the star, soaring 1.33 yuan or 10.03 percent 14.59 yuan on volume of 6.3 million shares.</p>
