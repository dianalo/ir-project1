<p>Business information agency Dun &amp; Bradstreet (D&amp;B) said on Thursday Slovenia's political profile was buoyed by President Milan Kucan's decision to stand for re-election this year.</p>
<p>"The political risk profile will be buoyed by ever-popular President Milan Kucan's June decision to stand for re-election at polls due by end 1997," the agency's Ljubljana office said in its latest Risk &amp; Payment Review.</p>
<p>Political analysts said Kucan, who has been acting as president of Slovenia since 1990 when it was still a part of the former Yugoslavia, is very likely to gain another five-year term in office.</p>
<p>D&amp;B awarded Slovenia a DB3a rating, unchanged for the 13th consecutive month, placing it behind the Czech Republic and ahead of Poland.</p>
<p>The agency warned against inflation, saying the OECD urged Slovenia's government to lower medium-term inflation via price liberalisation and to implement structural reforms to the pension system.</p>
<p>Currently virtually all pensions in Slovenia are paid from the public pension scheme which represents a huge burden on public spending.</p>
<p>The annual inflation rate in June eased to 8.8 percent from 8.9 percent in May and 10.5 percent in June last year. -- Marja Novak, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
