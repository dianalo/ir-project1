<p>New York State's comptroller Monday okayed a $110 million airport bond deal he said could save money, but Albany County Comptroller Michael Conners--whose approval is also needed--continues to oppose the deal, the Albany Times Union reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said Albany County Airport Authority's proposed negotiated sale is "appropriate," the Times Union said. Because the deal marks the airport's debut issue, the credit's story must be explained to potential buyers.</p>
<p>McCall said 83 percent of airport bond issues sold in the past five years exceeding $50 million were done as negotiated sales.</p>
<p>But Conners, whose rejection of the package last week blocked the authority's plans to come to market on January 13, said a competitive sale would cut investment banker fees. Conners also wants to trim the bonds' life from 30 years to 20 years, which he said would save $42 million in interest costs.</p>
<p>Airport officials, however, said they can save $5 million in a negotiated sale, but that they need to bring it before February 1, when other New York paper will flood the market.</p>
<p>Conners softened his position Monday, saying he would consider a 20-year negotiated sale. But airport officials say they spent three years in talks with airlines serving Albany Airport based on a 30-year issue. The airlines will reject a 20-year issue, they said.</p>
