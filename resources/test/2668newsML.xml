<p>Feyenoord Rotterdam and Roda JC Kerkrade drew 1-1 in a lacklustre opening to the Dutch soccer league season in Kerkrade on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The game came to life in the closing stages when Feyenoord's new midfield signing Kees van Wonderen scored in the 82nd minute only for Marco Roelofsen to equalise from a penalty with just two minutes left.</p>
<p>Players from both sides were involved in a scuffle after the match, but the referee and linesmen were already in the dressing room.</p>
<p>Champions Ajax Amsterdam start their campaign on Wednesday against NAC Breda.</p>
