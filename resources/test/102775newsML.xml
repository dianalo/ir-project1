<p>CAI Wireless Systems Inc on Tuesday defended its business prospects after a savaging of its shares that began with an analyst's downgrading last week.</p>
<p>The company, in which merger partners NYNEX Corp and Bell Atlantic Corp hold minority stakes, is a provider of wireless cable services, which send television signals by line of sight to subscribers.</p>
<p>"CAI is extremely confident in its (wireless) spectrum and in the company's ability to fully exploit its spectrum, notwithstanding the recent downturn in the company's stock price," said Chief Executive Jared Abbruzzese.</p>
