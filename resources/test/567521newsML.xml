<p>Belgian holding company Tractebel has won a Wallonia regional government subsidy for a feasibility study into five waste treatment plants in the Moscow region, the Walloon government said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The aid for Tractebel Development Wallonie amounts to up to 50 percent of eligible costs of some 12 million Belgian francs for the study and will take the form of a reimbursable advance.</p>
<p>The statement said there was currently no waste treatment infrastructure in the Moscow region. The project could result in orders worth five billion francs for Walloon metals, engineering and environmental technology companies.</p>
