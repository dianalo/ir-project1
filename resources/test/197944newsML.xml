<p>South African industrial group Anglovaal Industries Ltd (AVI) said on Monday that it saw no need to launch an unbundling programme of its investments.</p>
<p>South Africa's economy is marked by its sprawling holding companies and several have decided to unbundle their assets into separate firms.</p>
<p>But AVI managing director Richard Savage told a news conference that the group had done well in its present shape.</p>
<p>"We have done very well and we do not intend just selling off investments," he said.</p>
<p>Savage added that the group would only unbundle an investment in order to reinvest the funds in another market where the returns would be higher.</p>
<p>Savage was speaking as the group announced a tie-up wuith U.S. tyre giant Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Co .</p>
