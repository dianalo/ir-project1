<p>Second-seeded Czech Petr Korda "skated" into the second round of America's Red Clay Tennis Championship with a 6-3 6-4 victory over South African Neville Godwin on Monday.</p>
<p>Fifth seed Byron Black of Zimbabwe also advanced with a relatively easy 6-3 6-2 first-round victory over another South African, Marcos Ondruska.</p>
<p>The tournament, devoid of any top-20 players with virtually all of the sport's big names competing in European events, lost its third and eighth seeds on opening day.</p>
<p>In a match between two former U.S. collegiate champions, 88th-ranked Sargis Sargsian of Armenia upended 36th-ranked third seed Alex O'Brien of the U.S. 3-6 6-3 6-3.</p>
<p>Spaniard Juan Albert Viloca bounced eighth-seeded Austrian Gilbert Schaller 7-6 6-2.</p>
<p>Top-seeded Swede Jonas Bjorkman, ranked 23rd, and fourth-seeded defending champion Jason Stoltenberg of Australia, the runner-up Sunday in Atlanta, were scheduled to play first round matches on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Korda, ranked 29th, appeared to have an easy time disposing of the 95th-ranked Godwin, but said court conditions kept him from enjoying himself during the one hour contest.</p>
<p>"It feels like your're on ice," he complained.</p>
<p>"Maybe the Panthers practice here," Korda said referring to local ice hockey team.</p>
<p>"It's very slippery and it was affecting my movement. Whenever I'm on a court that's slippery I'm afraid to move."</p>
<p>Korda's fear was not unfounded. The former French Open finalist needed surgery to repair groin injuries in 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>The 64th-ranked Black was much more comfortable slip-sliding his way to victory.</p>
<p>"The court was a little bit slippery, but I was able to take control of the points and use the court to my advantage."</p>
