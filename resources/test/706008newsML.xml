<p>The guest of honour at Mike Tyson's birthday party never showed, but he kept about 100 potential revellers waiting until 3 a.m. EDT Thursday.</p>
<p>By 4 a.m., the Carbon club was empty.</p>
<p>Despite a club promoter's assurances, former heavyweight champion Tyson -- disqualified for biting champion Evander Holyfield in Saturday night's bout in Las Vegas -- was nowhere in sight for a belated birthday bash at the cavernous Manhattan club.</p>
<p>About 100 people milled around the mostly-empty dance floor listening to recorded rap and hip-hop music and waiting for Tyson, who turned 31 on Monday. The club's publicist said 600 people had been invited.</p>
<p>Carbon's management said early Thursday that Tyson's entourage had planned a huge bash, complete with two $30,000 ice sculptures made of specially-ordered Canadian water, but decided to keep the festivities minimal after Saturday's incident.</p>
<p>Last year, Tyson threw a huge birthday party at the same club, which was then named Mirage, said a club employee.</p>
<p>The Nevada State Athletic Commission will hold a disciplinary hearing next week to determine a punishment for Tyson, which could be as severe as a ban from boxing and could include the taking of some of his $30 million purse.</p>
