<title>MALAYSIA: Malaysian securities complaints fall in 1996.</title>
<headline>Malaysian securities complaints fall in 1996.</headline>

<p>Malaysia's Securities Commission (SC) said in its annual report that it received 120 complaints from investors in 1996, nine fewer than in 1995.</p>
<p>"Of these, 25 percent were closed without investigation, with the complainants informed of the decision," said the SC.</p>
<p>The regulator said the revocation of an application by a company to be listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange was a major event of its year.</p>
<p>Fumakilla Malaysia Bhd's application had been revoked in November as the company had made misleading statements about the level of ethnic Malay (Bumiputra) share participation in the company, the SC noted.</p>
<p>Under Malaysian company law, all publicly-listed companies should have at least 30 percent of their equity held by Bumiputras.</p>
<p>"The year's biggest case, however, was one of insider trading involving a managing director of a listed company. He was the first person in the country to be brought to court for such an offence," said the SC.</p>
<p>In November, Chua Seng Huat, managing director of Kim Hin Industries Bhd, was charged with two counts of insider trading involving the sale of 1.2 million shares.</p>
<p>Chua pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on bail. The case is still pending. The charges were brought under section 90 of the Securities Industry Act 1983, and carry a fine not less than one million ringgit and imprisonment of up to 10 years or both.</p>
<p>The SC said it had opened 21 new investigations in 1996, following complaints from the public.</p>
<p>"One of the proposals the Commission will push for next year is the wider recognition of civil remedies for securities laws violation," said SC chairman Munir Majid in his opening statement to the 1996 report.</p>
<p>The report showed funds of 16.80 billion ringgit ($6.68 billion) raised on the market in 1996, compared with 29.91 billion ringgit in 1995.</p>
<p>The total number of applications for capital raising also fell in 1996, dropping to 249 from 284 the previous year.</p>
