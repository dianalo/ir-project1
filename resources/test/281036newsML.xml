<p>Swedish shares closed 1996 at a record high on Monday, supported by favourable international trends and a surge in pharmaceutical giant Astra.</p>
<p>The general index rose 1.14 percent to a closing all-time high of 2371.12, ending the record year 1996, during which the index surged 38 percent, on an upbeat note.</p>
<p>Turnover was, however, a bit below average at 2.81 billion crowns as many market players were away ahead of the two-day New Year holiday. The market will open again on Thursday.</p>
<p>Astra rose on getting marketing clearance from the U.S. FDA for Lexxel, an agent for the treatment of hypertension.</p>
<p>Astra leapt nine crowns to 337 crowns on the news, in turn helping to lift the general index further.</p>
<p>After the record year 1996, in which turnover surged to 915 billion crowns from 665 billion crowns in 1995, five analysts polled by Reuters forecast a slower development in 1996, targeting, on average, a 13 percent general index increase.</p>
<p>Dealers saw, however, continued positive trends in January, but a downturn early in the month.</p>
<p>"People might want to take profits after the year-end," a dealer said, referring to investors' reluctance to sell shares late 1996 and be taxed for the profit on huge gains.</p>
<p>Along with Astra, rival Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn helped make the chemicals and pharmaceutical sector the clear winner, up 2.35 percent. Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn rose 4.5 crowns to 279.5 crowns.</p>
<p>Telecommunications group Ericsson also supported indices the last day of trading 1996 and rose by 2.5 crowns to 211 crowns.</p>
<p>Computer company Enator was also going strong, lifted by a newspaper article saying that there were seven serious would-be buyers of the state's 25 percent stake, which will be sold shortly. The share rose seven crowns to 174.5 crowns.</p>
