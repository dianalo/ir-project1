<p>Dollar/mark ended higher, preserving modest gains posted ahead of the Federal Reserve meeting on Tuesday, but dollar/yen slipped after the impact of a call for a weaker yen by a Japanese official wore off.</p>
<p>The dollar continued to recover from a slide to 1.5415 marks in Europe, with traders opting to cover shorts just before the outcome of a meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers was announced at 1414 EST/1914 GMT.</p>
<p>In the end, dealers got what they expected when Tuesday's meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee concluded with no change in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>The dollar closed at 1.5495/05 marks, up from 1.5488/93 at the open. But it slipped to 113.80/90 yen from 114.11/21.</p>
<p>The dollar shot above the 114 yen level in overseas trade after the Japanese cabinet member, Kabun Muto, director- general of the Management and Coordination Agency, told reporters in Tokyo that the yen should be "slightly cheaper" to prevent private companies from moving production overseas.</p>
<p>"I think the day was really highlighted by talk this morning that a Japanese cabinet member was talking up the dollar/yen," said Bob Near, vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Bank of New York.</p>
<p>But Muto, the minister in charge of reforming the Japanese bureaucracy, is not part of the Ministry of Finance, which sets exchange rate policy in Japan. The dollar drifted lower after the ministry reportedly said Muto was speaking for himself, traders noted.</p>
<p>"He clearly doesn't have authority on dollar/yen; he was talking to a domestic audience, no doubt," Near added.</p>
<p>Traders bought marks and sold dollars in Europe after Otmar Issing, Bundesbank chief economist, criticized measures reached on Friday to prevent European Union (EU) nations from running up budget deficits after Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p>"It's kind of telling you there could be a confrontation between Bonn and the Bundesbank," said James Powers, vice president of foreign exchange at Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in New York.</p>
<p>The mark tends to strengthen when the Bundesbank lashes out against the plan to replace the German unit with the euro, which could start off as a weak currency because some of the participating countries are expected to have difficulty maintaining sound fiscal policies after convergence.</p>
<p>But the dollar found its footing against the mark after the head of the French central bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, told Reuters Financial Television the market tends to underestimate the economic fundamentals for the dollar.</p>
<p>Traders said they construed Trichet's remark as another in a string of recent French calls for a higher dollar.</p>
<p>In addition, after weighing on the dollar early in the session, the U.S. stock market helped spur the dollar above 1.55 marks when it moved sharply from the minus to the plus column later in the day, traders said.</p>
<p>"On any sign of weakness in stocks, people sell the dollar down and on any signs of strength people buy it back," said Jeffrey Yu, senior dealer at Sanwa Bank in New York.</p>
<p>But a slide in U.S. Treasury bonds after a report of a 9.2 percent surge in November U.S. housing starts, the biggest rise since July 1995, did no lasting damage to the dollar.</p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar rose to 1.3255/65 Swiss francs from 1.3224/34 at the open but fell to Canadian $1.3627/32 from C$1.3703/08. The pound rose to $1.6712/22 from $1.6668/78 and the Australian dollar rose to $0.7958/63 from $0.7934/39.</p>
