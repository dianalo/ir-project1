<p>The Swiss National Bank (SNB) said chances are slim that the Swiss franc will come under unbearable upward pressure in connection with efforts to forge Europe's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) and options to counter such pressure would not endanger price stability as long as they were temporary.</p>
<p>SNB board member Bruno Gehrig told a news conference that even if the chance of upward pressures were slight, such an event could not be totally excluded.</p>
<p>The SNB faces three options to counter upward pressure on the franc, which could arise if Europe's monetary integration process turns instable, Gehrig said.</p>
<p>The first option is to reduce upward pressure on the franc by boosting liquidity through normal channels and lowering interest rates.</p>
<p>The second option is to directly intervene in foreign currency markets and buy large amounts of foreign currencies against Swiss francs.</p>
<p>Such interventions are also possible when interest rates are low because the SNB theoretically would be able to buy as much of its own currency as it wants.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a possibility of linking the interventions with an upper limit to the franc to underscore our intention.</p>
<p>"These possible actions are not problematic with regards to price stability as long as they are temporary corrections," Gehrig said.</p>
<p>"Certainly, these are ticklish stability manoeuvres. But they show we have scope for action," Gehrig added.</p>
