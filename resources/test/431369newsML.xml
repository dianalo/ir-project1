<p>Oskar Lafontaine, leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats (SPD), on Monday said cross-party talks on major tax reforms could only resume if the coalition government comes up with new proposals.</p>
<p>"If there are no new proposals, there won't be any new talks between the SPD and coalition," Lafontaine said after a meeting of SPD leaders. The SPD pulled out of tax talks at the weekend in solidarity with miners protesting against government plans to more than halve coal industry subsidies.  </p>
<p>Lafontaine added: "Whatever is targeted at fighting unemployment will win our support."</p>
<p>The SPD has supported four-day-old protests by pit workers from the Ruhr and Saar coalfields against government plans announced last week to cut federal subsidies from nine billion marks this year to 3.8 billion by 2005.</p>
<p>Lafontaine, who is also premier of Saarland state, said the fate of the tax reform talks hung on a meeting on Tuesday between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and miners union leaders on the question of winding down pit subsidies.</p>
<p>He rejected comments by government leaders that there was no connection between coal aid and taxes. He said Bonn was demanding 700 million marks in extra coal subsidies from North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) state -- home to the Ruhr coalfields -- while NRW would lose five billion marks in tax revenues from the planned tax reform.</p>
