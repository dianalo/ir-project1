<headline>Qatar ruling family ends dispute over missing money.</headline>

<p>The ruling family in the oil and gas-rich Gulf state of Qatar on Sunday announced it had ended a dispute over billions of dollars missing from the treasury since the former emir was toppled by his son last year.</p>
<p>A justice ministry statement quoted by Qatar's official news agency said the government was dropping all lawsuits against the deposed emir in return for settling accounts at the centre of their dispute.</p>
<p>Qatari officials and diplomats said the way was now open for the return of the former emir from self-imposed exile to Qatar, now ruled by his son Sheikhh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani.</p>
<p>The settlement was reached at a London hotel between the foreign minister, Sheikhh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, acting on behalf of the current emir, and Isa Ghanem al-Kuwari, former head of Emiri Diwan (royal court) affairs, acting on behalf of the former emir, a senior palace official said.</p>
<p>The justice ministry did not say how much was in the disputed accounts, but unofficial estimates said the sum controlled by Sheikhh Khalifa bin Hamad al-Thani since his ouster by his eldest son in a bloodless palace coup in June 1995 ranged from $3 billion to $7 billion.</p>
<p>The ministry said the settlement was "in return for the payment of accounts that were the subject of the dispute."</p>
<p>Authorities in Britain, France and Switzerland blocked several bank accounts controlled by the former emir earlier this year at the request of the new government in Doha.</p>
<p>The Qatari justice ministry statement said the agreement to drop all lawsuits inside and outside the country against Sheikhh Khalifa and Kuwari was in return for settling the accounts.</p>
<p>The settlement promises to ease more than a year of political uncertainty in the small, sparsely-populated Gulf Arab peninsula state whose only land border is with Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Qatar is a small oil exporter whose native population of 120,000 is among the world's richest with gross national product of $22,000 each. Some 440,000 foreigners, mostly from the Indian subcontinent and Iran, work in Qatar.</p>
<p>Qatar's oil reserves are overshadowed by its natural gas deposits, which are exceeded only by those of Russia and Iran.</p>
