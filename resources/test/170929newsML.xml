<p>Portugal's Finance Ministry denied a report in Tuesday's Diario Economico paper which quoted a senior official as saying the government was preparing for a possible privatisation of Banco Nacional Ultramarino (BNU).</p>
<p>"Under-Secretary for the Budget Manuela Arcanjo clarifies that in terms of the privatisation programme for 1996/97, BNU will not be privatised," a statement said.</p>
<p>The paper had quoted Arcanjo as saying the Socialist government was preparing for a possible privatisation of BNU by transferring its pension fund to social security system Caixa Geral de Aposentacoes (CGA).</p>
<p>"It is not and it would never be the intention of the government to conduct the transfer of BNU's (pension) responsibilities to the CGA in order to contribute to a reduction in the (budget) deficit," the finance ministry said.</p>
<p>"The transfer of BNU's (pension) responsibilities to CGA aimed to contribute to the financial health of that institution (BNU)," it added.</p>
