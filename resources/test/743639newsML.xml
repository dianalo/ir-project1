<headline>UK meals and feeds lower, buyers sidelined.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>UK meals and feeds prices were lower on Monday in anticipation of a sharp fall on the Chicago futures market.</p>
<p>Forecasts for the U.S. Midwest were calling for rain during the early part of the week in the main soybean growing areas.</p>
<p>Sellers in the UK lowered ex-mill high protein soymeal asking prices by around two stg while stores were as much as 2.50 stg down.</p>
<p>Rapemeal from the Liverpool and Hull mills was one stg down to unchanged while the Erith mill was between two and four stg lower.</p>
<p>However, brokers said buyers were not showing any interest.</p>
<p>"The buyers think the market's going to come lower and they won't move for the moment," said one.</p>
