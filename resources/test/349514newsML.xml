<p>Ladbroke Group Plc Chief Executive Peter George held talks in February 1996 with ITT Corp officials about a possible joint venture or merger, according to documents filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday.</p>
<p>The filing, made by Hilton Hotels Corp to formalize its $6.5 billion hostile bid for ITT, said no combination resulted from the talks. Further details were unavailable.</p>
<p>Ladbroke owns Hilton International Inc, which operates Hilton hotels overseas. Ladbroke and Hilton Hotels have entered into an alliance to market the Hilton brand name.</p>
<p>George is a member of Hilton Hotels's board, and Hilton Hotels Chief Executive Officer Stephen Bollenbach sits on Ladbroke's board.</p>
<p>The documents also disclosed that Arthur Goldberg, former chairman of Bally Entertainment Corp, had contacted ITT about a possible merger in late 1992 and in 1996.</p>
<p>The talks did not result in any combination, and Hilton Hotels and Bally went on to merge in 1996. Goldberg is now the president of Hilton's gaming operations.</p>
