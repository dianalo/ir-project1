<p>United Airlines, the U.S. carrier, said on Friday that it has ordered an additional number of aircraft from European manufacturer Airbus. UAL said in a statement released in Bonn that it would add four Airbus 319 and three Airbus 320 planes to an order for 24 A319s placed in August.</p>
<p>UAL said that the orders were part of a general modernisation of its carrier fleet for which it would invest some $5.2 billion to the year 2000 and retire 111 aging aircraft.</p>
