<p>Chinese Premier Li Peng on Monday formally appointed Hong Kong shipping tycoon Tung Chee-hwa as the first post-colonial chief executive for the territory.</p>
<p>Li approved Tung's selection in an order issued by the State Council, or cabinet, and carried by the Xinhua news agency.</p>
<p>A 400-member Selection Committee, vetted by Beijing, last week chose Tung to lead Hong Kong after the British colony returns to Chinese rule next year.</p>
<p>"Tung Chee-hwa is appointed as the first chief executive of the People's Republic of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, to take office on July 1, 1997," the State Council order said.</p>
<p>Tung, 59, had been widely seen as Beijing's favoured candidate to replace British colonial governor Chris Patten even before he won a resounding majority of votes from the Selection Committee.</p>
<p>His selection won plaudits in Beijing, but was accompanied by protests from Hong Kong democrats who accused China of denying the territory a chance to elect its first post-colonial leader.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government said on Monday it would set limits on how much it would help Tung to form his administration ahead of the handover of sovereignty.</p>
<p>Secretary for Constitutional Affairs Nicholas Ng said the government had ruled out any major secondment of high-ranking officials to the future government being assembled by Tung.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong government rejected any secondment on a major scale because it would negatively affect the civil service, Ng said. Whatever secondments were made would not be allowed to undermine stability and efficiency.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's transition to Chinese rule has been fraught with disputes between London and Beijing over issues ranging from human rights and democracy to infrastructure projects.</p>
