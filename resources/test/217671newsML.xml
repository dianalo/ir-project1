<headline>Probe into Lagardere share buying - paper.</headline>

<p>The French stock market watchdog, COB, has launched a probe into buying of Lagardere shares before the government's unexpected announcement that it would sell electronics group Thomson to the conglomerate, the satirical weekly Le Canard Enchaine said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB) would not confirm the report, saying only: "The COB is doing its job."  </p>
<p>The report, to appear in Wednesday's edition of the newspaper, said the COB opened the inquiry on November 12 after noting unusually high trading volume in Lagardere shares on October 15, the day before the government announced its choice for the buyer of Thomson.</p>
<p>The centre-right government selected Lagardere's offer over a rival bid submitted by civilian industrial group Alcatel Alsthom, surprising many who believed Alcatel's bid was most likely to succeed.</p>
<p>On October 14, Lagardere shares closed at 129.30 francs on volume of 35,500 shares.  </p>
<p>On December 15, volume swelled to 427,000 and the share closed at 133.10 francs.</p>
<p>On October 16, trading in the share was suspended. On October 17, when trading resumed, Lagardere traded at 179 francs and volume totalled six million shares.</p>
<p>The government said it was logical to choose Lagardere, which owns defence firm Matra, because of the nature of the defense industry.</p>
<p>The government is selling Thomson to Lagardere for a symbolic franc after injecting 11 billion francs into the defence and consumer electronics group.</p>
