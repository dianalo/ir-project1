<p>China said on Thursday that Hong Kong people should not organise political activities that attack internal affairs in the mainland after the British colony returns to Beijing rule in mid-1997.</p>
<p>"Hong Kong should not interfere in mainland China's affairs by organising some political activities to attack the mainland's internal affairs," Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told a briefing.  </p>
<p>Hong Kong residents would have freedom of the press and speech as long as such activities remained within the boundaries of the law, Shen said.</p>
<p>"Hong Kong people will have full freedom of expression, but all freedoms must be within the limits allowed by law," Shen said. He had been asked whether Hong Kong residents would be allowed to hold ceremonies to commemorate Beijing's bloody June 4, 1989 crackdown on students demonstrating for more democracy in Tiananmen Square.</p>
<p>"Any activities held in Hong Kong must be in accordance with legal regulations," he said.</p>
