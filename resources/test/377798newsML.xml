<p>Britain's Williams Holdings Plc on Friday launched a 1.3 billion-pound ($2.12 billion) offer for Chubb Security Plc in a deal that would unite global home and security brand names like Yale locks and Chubb safes.</p>
<p>"From an industrial point of view, it is an absolutely logical fit," Williams Chief Executive Roger Carr said in an interview.</p>
<p>Williams' brands include Yale locks and security devices and Kidde, a maker of fire protection products which is the leading U.S. supplier of domestic fire extinguishers. Williams also owns Corbin Russwin locks and door-closing devices in North America.</p>
<p>Chubb makes locks, safes, fire extinguishers and alarms and provides security guards. It is not affiliated with Chubb Corp., the Warren, N.J.-based insurance company.</p>
<p>A merger would create a company with combined annual sales of about 2.7 billion pounds ($4.46 billion).</p>
<p>Williams said its strengths in the Americas and Continental Europe would get a boost from Chubb's presence in Britain and the Asia-Pacific region. The deal also would unlock benefits in purchasing, distribution and plant consolidation.</p>
<p>Analysts agreed the merger made good strategic sense, but some balked at the cash-and-stock offer, which valued Chubb at 450 pence ($7.34) per share.</p>
<p>"The fit is excellent for Williams, but the issue is the price. People think they overpaid. They should have paid maybe 15-16 times earnings, not 21 times," one analyst said.</p>
<p>Other analysts defended the price.</p>
<p>"It is the price they had to pay to improve the quality of Williams. They will make it pay, but it will take a little longer than perhaps we would have preferred," said Geoff Allum, diversified industrials analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite.</p>
<p>Williams and Chubb were among the most heavily traded stocks on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Williams dropped 37 pence (60 cents), or nearly 11 percent, to 301 pence ($4.91), making it one of the biggest percentage losers on the exchange, while Chubb dropped 52 pence (85 cents) to 368 pence ($6.00).</p>
<p>Williams said its offer represented a 37 percent premium over the closing price of 329.5 pence ($5.38) for Chubb stock Tuesday.</p>
<p>Takeover speculation since then has pushed Chubb stock higher in a surge that was being investigated by the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Chubb's stock soared 82 pence ($1.34) or more than 24 percent, to a year high of 423 pence ($6.90) after the company said it was in talks that might lead to an offer for the company.</p>
<p>Williams's offer -- two new Williams shares and 704.12 pence ($11.49) in cash for every three Chubb shares -- consisted of about 50 percent cash and 50 percent stock, the company said.</p>
<p>Williams said it expected to receive regulatory clearance for the deal and overcome any possible monopoly concerns.</p>
