<p>Rioters armed with stolen assault rifles torched buildings and looted shops and banks in the Adriatic town of Sarande on Sunday in unrest undiminished by the resignation of Albania's government.</p>
<p>Demonstrators cruised the streets in cars, shooting into the air with Kalashnikovs looted when they stormed a police headquarters and put officers to flight.</p>
<p>Thick, black smoke billowed from the building and from the library and a bank in the southern coastal town, a short ferry ride from the Greek holiday island of Corfu.</p>
<p>Residents said about 100 convicts had broken out of jail. Youths could be seen breaking into banks and shops and six police vehicles burned in the main square.</p>
<p>"There are no injured because there were no clashes. The police have fled," an official at Sarande's hospital said.</p>
<p>The army barracks on the edge of the town, about a third of whose 20,000 residents are ethnic Greeks, was also deserted.</p>
<p>"Our commanding officers have fled. We don't know what to do. People stole about 400 Kalashnikovs from police headquarters. I'll try to make my way back to Tirana where my home is," a lieutenant who gave his first name as Adrian said.</p>
<p>One weeping woman, clutching her four-year-old daughter, said she planned to pack up and cross into Greece and a local member of parliament for the Greek minority, Thoma Mico, said he feared a mass exodus over the nearby border.</p>
<p>"In Sarande you have 20-year-old kids shooting Kalashnikovs in the air. There is total anarchy," Mico told Reuters.</p>
<p>The violence added to spiralling chaos in the south of impoverished Albania, where tens of thousands of people have lost life savings in bankrupt pyramid investment schemes.</p>
<p>President Sali Berisha, blamed by many savers for their penury and grappling with the worst crisis of his rule, responded to pressure for action on Saturday by removing his deeply unpopular right-wing Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi.</p>
<p>"It all started yesterday after Berisha said the government was to resign," one Sarande resident called Marko said.</p>
<p>Opposition leaders in Tirana and residents in the tinderbox town of Vlore dismissed Meksi's removal as a cosmetic move that would not end the chaos in Albania, Europe's poorest state.</p>
<p>Protest organisers in Vlore, scene of the worst bloodshed in two months of mushrooming disorder, demanded the dissolution of parliament and called on Berisha not to stand for re-election in a vote scheduled in the chamber on Monday.</p>
<p>Pressing for the formation of a technocrat government and early elections, they said they would move on the capital, 150 km (90 miles) to the north, unless Berisha responded to their demands by Sunday evening.</p>
<p>Berisha's official villa in Vlore was among buildings pillaged by residents, many of them armed after raids on police weapons stores. Witnesses said looters were carting off doors and windows and uprooting flowers from the villa's garden.</p>
<p>Up to nine people were reported killed in Vlore on Friday night in a gunbattle between residents and Albania's Shik secret police.</p>
<p>The speaker at a daily rally in the town said protesters were holding an unspecified number of Shik agents hostage.</p>
