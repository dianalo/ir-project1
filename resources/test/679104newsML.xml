<headline>French Socialist says policies will help euro goal.</headline>

<p>France's new Socialist-led government said on Sunday that its policies would help rather than hinder Paris's goal of taking part in a single European currency from 1999.</p>
<p>"The new path of growth we are going to take, and structural measures, should let us meet the criteria (for the euro currency) more easily," Employment Minister Martine Aubry said.</p>
<p>"That's what we want in order to create the euro on time," she told France 2 television three weeks after the left won an upset parliamentary victory.</p>
<p>Aubry, number two to Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, rejected opposition criticisms that Jospin's policies would mean higher spending and so jeopardise France's chances of meeting the criteria for economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>"It's because our country has broken down, because we have lower growth than our neighbours that we have lower tax receipts, less income from social charges and so we are today far from the planned target," she said.</p>
<p>Aubry, daughter of former European Commission president Jacques Delors, reiterated the Socialists would keep campaign promises including creation of 700,000 jobs over three years and cutting the working week from 39 hours to 35 over five years.</p>
<p>Jospin has ordered an audit of public finances that will see how far France is from cutting its budget deficit to three percent of gross domestic product in 1997, a target for countries wanting to join the euro at its planned 1999 start. France's 1996 deficit was 4.2 percent of GDP.</p>
