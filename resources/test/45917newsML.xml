<p>The doctors, engineers and economists at the Petrovsko-Razumovskoe market in northern Moscow are a well-tanned, well-travelled bunch who make up part of Russia's entrepreneurial class.</p>
<p>Disillusioned at low pay in the state sector, sometimes desperate to feed their families, they have seized the opportunities of open borders to import foreign goods that their fellow citizens have long been without.</p>
<p>But the government, accusing these "shuttle traders" of making a quick ruble at Russia's expense, plans to make good taxpayers of them all, sharply cutting the volume of goods individuals can import without paying tax.</p>
<p>The shuttle traders fan out with empty suitcases across Europe and Asia, returning through Russia's newly-porous borders with bulging bags held together with tape and string.</p>
<p>They sell their wares at colourful street markets across Russia. Their goods are often poor-quality fakes, but they are also cheap -- a key consideration for Russia's poor.</p>
<p>The traders, wary of giving their last names, say the profits are good.</p>
<p>"In the West you might make 15 percent profit -- right?" asked Valery, a broad-faced Russian with a big grin and a Lada car covered with fake brand-name jeans. "We don't work unless we make 50 percent."</p>
<p>Customs officials say between 5 million and 8 million shuttle traders bring in about $10 billion worth of goods each year, robbing government coffers of almost $1 billion in taxes in the country's second largest industry after oil.</p>
<p>Traders include individuals who bring in bulging cases of consumer goods by hand and sell them at markets and to larger organisations. In both cases the trade is done without official approval.</p>
<p>There is no limit to the range of shuttle-imported goods -- calculators, fax machines, shoes, leather -- and jeans.</p>
<p>"It is more than a grey business, it is illegal," said Vladimir Galdin, head of the Russian Customs Committee legal department, adding that the traders were undermining the economy by hurting domestic producers and legal importers.</p>
<p>Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov has said the new measures would cut choice and create shortages in the capital. The upper house of parliament, acting after Luzhkov's intervention, has asked the government to change its plans.</p>
<p>Officials say the shuttle traders will not lose their jobs and forecast that most of them will adjust to paying fair taxes.</p>
<p>Many shuttle traders are not worried by government threats and said it was easy to bribe their way round existing regulations.</p>
<p>Sveta, an economist who with her doctor husband, Yuri, has moved from lugging suitcases to ordering jeans from Turkey by air cargo in just two years, smoked an expensive Marlboro cigarette and smiled at the idea of customs duties.</p>
<p>"We are flexible. We'll get around whatever the politicians come up with," she said.</p>
<p>Valery, whose wife does the shopping while he does the selling, said he generally paid customs officials about a third the official tariff. "Less on planes, more on trains," he said.</p>
<p>The small entrepreneurs also question the government's resolve to go through with its plans.</p>
<p>"There are 10 million of us, and if we lose our work there will be huge problems," said 20-year-old Masakik, comfortably selling his wares in a pair of flipflop sandals and T-shirt.</p>
<p>Even above-board Moscow salesmen who buy their goods through wholesale warehouses have mixed views on the new taxes.</p>
<p>Arkady Aksentoyev, a salesman whose boss buys jeans from a Moscow warehouse, said President Boris Yeltsin was behind the move, paying off political debts. Arkady accused Yeltsin of waiting until his re-election in July to establish the new rules.</p>
<p>"It's a pure political trick. Everything is going to be more expensive, but the same bribes will still be paid. It's only the people who are going to get hurt," he says.</p>
<p>Salesman Stanislav Khimich, in a pony tail and cowboy boots, fingered the fake Wrangler jeans in his stall, also bought from a warehouse, and said he welcomed the government crackdown.</p>
<p>"The future is with the warehouses, not the shuttle traders," he said. "The new rules will give us a monopoly on sales."</p>
