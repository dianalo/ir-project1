<p>The newly declared Democratic Republic of Congo has restored the star-spangled national flag first adopted at independence in 1960, an official said on Monday.</p>
<p>Moise Myarugabo, secretary-general in the office of self-proclaimed President Laurent Kabila, told Reuters his alliance was intent on reverting to the old flag, in parallel with the decision to drop the name Zaire.</p>
<p>The blue and yellow flag with one large star in the centre and six smaller stars in a vertical line close to the staff flies on government buildings in parts of the country captured by the alliance in earlier stages of its seven-month rebellion.</p>
<p>The single star represents the united country and the smaller six represent its six original provinces. The country now has nine provinces and new authorities have not yet taken a decision to redraw boundaries.</p>
<p>Following the seven-month civil war Kabila on Saturday changed the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of Congo and declared himself its leader. He acted as his rebels entered Kinshasa, a day after Zaire President Mobutu Sese Seko relinquished power and abandoned his capital.</p>
<p>Mobutu renamed Africa's third largest country as Zaire in 1971. His flag showed an arm carrying a burning torch, in a circle surrounded by a green background.</p>
<p>The new flag is also the flag of the now-ruling Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (AFDL). The alliance adopted it as a gesture of defiance towards all the changes made by Mobutu during his 32 years as president.</p>
