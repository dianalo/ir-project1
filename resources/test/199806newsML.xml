<p>Consumer electronic products distributor Thakral Corp Ltd, which saw six month net profits up 20 percent, said on Tuesday it was confident it would meet the requirements for a Singapore dollar listing.</p>
<p>The company, which also distributes audio-visual products from JVC, Panasonic, Sharp and Sony, is currently listed in US dollars on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES).  </p>
<p>"Internally with a slight restructure, we will be able to meet the criteria," said managing director Inderbethal Singh Thakral at a news conference announcing the company's six months results to September 30, 1996.</p>
<p>"We hope to put a package to SES to see if it accepts," Thakral said, adding that the proposal would be made within this year.</p>
<p>Thakral said one of the criteria, yet unfulfilled, was for the Economic Development Board of Singapore to extend the company's Operational Headquarters status to 10 years from five years.  </p>
<p>The company said the extraordinary loss of S$2.85 million incurred by associate company, Wearnes Thakral Pte Ltd, included prior period expenses of S$1.41 million and costs related to cessation of manufacturing activities and restructuring.</p>
<p>Thakral said the company would now concentrate on distributing IBM products in Malaysia and looked to distributing more computer products within the region where Wearnes Thakral has a better market.  </p>
<p>On Friday, Thakral announced its net profits for the six months ended September 30 rose 20 percent to Singapore $28.67 million, while turnover eased to S$552.09 million from S$568.97 million. Pre-tax profits rose 18.5 percent to S$34.86 million.</p>
<p>Thakral attributed the improvement in pre-tax profits to better sourcing of products and improved margins as a result of bulk distributions to a wider range of customers.</p>
<p>Thakral said the company was likely to maintain margins for the second half and was looking to increase turnover as the economy picks up.  </p>
<p>"We expect losses incurred will be arrested...We expect better increment from Wearnes Thakral itself," Thakral said, adding that in the second half a small loss from Wearnes is still expected.</p>
<p>Thakral said the company would continue to focus on manufacturing and distributing consumer electronic products in Hong Kong and China.</p>
<p>Hong and China contribute 55 percent and 40 percent respectively to the company's turnover and 96 percent and four percent respectively to its pre-tax profit.  </p>
<p>Thakral said its direct investment division will continue to concentrate on non-core investments like property. Thakral added that by March net year, the company would have used up its US$25 million budget set aside for non-core investment.</p>
