<p>Financial services group ING Groep said on Monday the assets under management of its ING Investment Management Europa unit grew by 9.6 percent to 107 billion guilders in the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>The unit manages the assets of ING's institutional clients in Europe, the investment funds of the ING stable and the ING insurance subsidiaries. All parts equally contributed to the first-half growth, ING said in a statement.</p>
<p>The group said virtually all its share investments had shown better results than the benchmarks in their respective sectors, with emerging market funds in particular as outperformers.</p>
<p>Fixed income investments in guilders and German marks were lagging slightly behind the average of the Dutch market but international fixed income funds showed a "relatively satisfying" performance, ING said without elaborating.</p>
<p>By the middle of the current year, ING had assets under mangement from institutional clients totalling 28.6 billion guilders, up 9.6 percent from 26.1 billion at end-1995.</p>
<p>The assets of ING's investment funds grew by 10.2 percent to 16.2 billion guilders from 14.7 billion and the group's insurance units' assets increased by 9.5 percent to 62.2 billion from 56.8 billion by the end of last year.</p>
