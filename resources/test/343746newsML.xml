<p>The Brazilian Social Democratic Party (PSDB) will continue to grow as its most eminent member, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, gains ground in pushing his plan to run for re-election through Congress, the party's president said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The prospect of Cardoso making a 1998 presidential bid and winning the race is widely expected to cause upheaval within the ranks of the 16 parties represented in Congress. Their numbers already fluctuate with every political twist and turn.  </p>
<p>Three deputies from parties allied to Cardoso joined the PSDB on Wednesday, the day after a bill allowing the president's re-election was given a first approval in the Chamber of Deputies. The party now has 90 members of the 513-strong lower house.</p>
<p>On the same day, the Brazilian Labor Party and the Brazilian Progressive Party, with 25 deputies between them, agreed to ally themselves with the PSDB, giving it the biggest block in the chamber and the right to nominate deputies to run committees.  </p>
<p>"It is only natural that with approval of re-election there is a demand for places within the PSDB," the party's president, Sen. Teotonio Vilela, said.</p>
<p>But he said the party would not accept new members just for the sake of increasing its clout in Congress.</p>
<p>"We don't want to pack the party with people who do not agree with our political views and just want to take advantage of the situation," Vilela told Reuters by telephone from the northeastern state of Alagoas.  </p>
<p>The PSDB was formed in the 1980s as a breakaway faction of the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), currently the biggest party in Congress with 102 members of the lower house.</p>
<p>While the PMDB has limped from one internal crisis to another, the PSDB has prospered from Cardoso's popularity and tripled its number of mayors to more than 900 in November's municipal elections.</p>
<p>Party leaders hope to repeat that kind of performance in the 1998 federal elections and become the single largest party in Congress.  </p>
<p>A proposed reform of Brazil's electoral system, including a clause preventing lawmakers from changing parties mid-term, is also seen as bolstering the PSDB and its loyal ally, the Liberal Front Party (PFL), at the expense of the PMDB.</p>
<p>Some PMDB leaders were so worried about lawmakers rushing into the Cardoso camp before approval of the reform, they unsuccessfully tried to persuade the government to incorporate it into the re-election bill.</p>
<p>"There's going to be an avalanche of deputies heading the PSDB's way," said PMDB senator Pedro Simon. "They'll be the biggest party in Congress by March or April."</p>
<p>The PSDB president denied his party was seeking to undermine its allies whose support is crucial to the government's reform program.</p>
<p>"We want the party to grow via the ballot box and not at the expense of our allies," Vilela said.</p>
