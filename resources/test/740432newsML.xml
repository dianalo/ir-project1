<p>*Australian bond yields finished higher, largely reflecting extreme weakness in the neighbouring New Zealand market and further softness in U.S. Treasuries in Tokyo trade.</p>
<p>*Q2 inflation and wages data, Greenspan testimony next week.  </p>
<p>Australian bond yields finished higher, largely reflecting extreme weakness in the neighbouring New Zealand market and further softness in U.S. Treasuries during Tokyo trading.</p>
<p>"The kiwi market got absolutely caned and the U.S. came off a bit more, so we really played catch-up to that. (Bernie) Fraser had no real impact, a basis point at most," said one bond trader. "People think he's been out of the post too long now."</p>
<p>Former Reserve Bank governor Fraser told a conference in Melbourne that the monetary authorities had missed an opportunity to cut rates a fifth time in the past year.  </p>
<p>Fraser, who stepped down as governor last September, sent the Australian dollar into frenzy last December when he said policy should have been loosened faster and further.</p>
<p>The comments actually held back the RBA from easing until the currency settled down.</p>
<p>The market faces a key week next week, which may settle whether the the RBA can ease policy for a fifth time this cycle.</p>
<p>Second quarter inflation and wages data are due on Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Median forecasts centre on a 0.1 percent quarterly fall in the headline CPI, according to a Reuters survey of economists.  </p>
<p>This would give an annual rate of just 0.5 percent, while the policy sensitive underlying rate is seen rising 0.5 percent for annual growth of a mere 1.7 percent. Average weekly ordinary time earnings are seen up 0.8 percent for an annual 4.1 percent.</p>
<p>Such inflation outcomes would be far superior to that of the U.S. and is expected to trigger a further sharp narrowing in the yield spread to the U.S.</p>
<p>Although a Reuters poll of economists taken on Friday found expectations for the Australian/U.S. 10-year bond yield spread at year-end centring on a median 50 basis points, some see a test of parity before then.  </p>

<p>The local negative yield spreads to New Zealand grew sharply after the debt market adjusted to take account of plunge in the N.Z. dollar to keep monetary conditions at the RBNZ's desired level. Meanwhile, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan is due to deliver his semi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony next week.  </p>
