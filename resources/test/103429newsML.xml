<p>British football club Manchester United Plc said on Tuesday that it is looking at the development of a Manchester United magazine TV channel.</p>
<p>"We are talking to third parties but it is early days yet. We don't know which way we want to go yet, whether we want to go with partners or do it by ourselves," chief executive Martin Edwards said in a telephone conference interview. United earlier announced that pre-tax profits for the year ending July 31 after expenditure on players had fallen to 15.40 million stg compared with 20.01. It raised the final divided by 16 percent to 3.6p for a total divided of 5.2p from 4.5p.  </p>
<p>Net expenditure on player transfers was 1.3 million stg compared with a net income of 3.7 million stg previously. Gross expenditure on player transfers was 7.6 million stg, while income from the tranfer of players was 6.3 million stg.</p>
<p>United said turnover fell during the year as a result of the reduction in spectator capacity due to the rebuilding of the North Stand and the absence of European Champions League income of the previous year.</p>
<p>Overall turnover slipped to 53.32 million stg from 60.62 million, while merchandising and other turnover income fell to 18.7 million from 23.5 million previously.  </p>
<p>"The main reason (why merchandising turnover was down) was because we sold our video publishing rights to VCI, so what we really swapped was some turnover for royalty. This year things are picking up again," said Edwards.</p>
<p>The rebuilding of the North Stand, which extends capacity to over 55,000 from 44,000, has been completed.</p>
<p>"Already we have seen near capacity attendances at Old Trafford averaging over 54,000 per game. Increased attendances have a favourable impact upon the whole range of Manchester United's operational activities," said Chairman Roland Smith in a statement accompanying results.  </p>
<p>United also said it would begin to enjoy the financial benefits from a new agreement with UMBRO and the new terms of a Premier League agreement with BSkyB. The football club signed a new sponsorship deal with UMBRO Ltd in February, which will carry sponsorship to July 2002.</p>
<p>The search for a finance director looks to be nearing an end with Edwards revealing that a number of interviews have been arranged for the week after next.</p>
<p>Robin Launders resigned as finance director in August to join northern England rival Leeds United as chief executive.</p>
<p>Shares in Manchester United were 2p higher at 453.5 by 0845 GMT.</p>
