<p>The former prosecutor who jailed the brother of ex-President Carlos Salinas on murder charges was arrested in Madrid on Friday, state news agency Notimex reported.</p>
<p>Pablo Chapa Bezanilla turned fugitive after Mexican authorities accused him of evidence-rigging and body-snatching while special prosecutor in the Attorney General's Office.</p>
<p>The charges against him arose in March from the discovery of a skeleton in late 1996 at the Mexico City ranch of Raul Salinas, brother to the ex-president, whom Chapa arrested in February 1995 on charges of masterminding the murder of Jose Francisco Ruiz Massieu, secretary general of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party.</p>
<p>Chapa led the public to believe that the body was that of a missing congressmen who was wanted on charges of helping Raul Salinas plan the killing.</p>
<p>Investigators, however, found the body was that of the relative of a witch who was helping Chapa with the investigation.</p>
<p>Authorities claimed it was dug up from a cemetery and planted at the Salinas ranch.</p>
<p>Chapa was fired from the attorney general's office in December 1996 and has been in hiding since February.</p>
