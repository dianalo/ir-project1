<p>Taiwan is expected to tender for 54,000 tonnes of soybeans and for 68,000 tonnes of wheat over the next two weeks, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Kaohsiung division of Taiwan's Breakfast Soybean Procurement Association is considering placing a tender for a 54,000-tonne shipment of soybeans for June delivery, they said.</p>
<p>The sharp fall in U.S. soybean futures prices on Friday may prompt the group to delay the tender to next week to see if prices will ease further.  </p>
<p>The May contract on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT) closed 24-3/4 U.S. cents down on Friday at $8.30-1/2 a bushel due to indications firm prices had sharply curtailed demand, U.S. traders said.</p>
<p>"Kaohsiung's soybean buyers were ready to enter the market this week, but now they will have to wait for the futures prices to hit bottom," an oilseeds trader in Taiwan said.</p>
<p>Taiwanese buyers were also expected to tender on Tuesday for two 34,000-tonne U.S. wheat shipments for late April to early June delivery, dealers said.  </p>
<p>There were no corn tenders seen taking place this week as most buyers are still working on reducing inventories after an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease crippled the country's major pork export trade.</p>
<p>Taiwanese grain importers said they expected corn imports to slide by about 1.2 million tonnes, or 19 percent of the island's imports of 6.5 million tonnes a year.</p>
<p>Soybean imports may also fall by about 10 percent as the ban on pork exports slashes feed demand for soymeal.  </p>
<p>Freight rates were seen at about US$14.00 a tonne from the Pacific Northwest and were quoted at $24.00-$24.50 a tonne from the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
