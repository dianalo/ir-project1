<p>UK new construction orders were down two perecent in the three months to April compared with the previous three month but rose sharply in April itself, the Department of Environment said.</p>
<p>The total volume of new orders was eight percent higher compared with the same three-month period a year ago.  </p>
<p>The decline in orders from the previous three months was caused by large falls in the private housing and infrastructure sectors.</p>
<p>In April alone, the total volume of construction new orders rose sharply as the private industrial and private commercial sectors recorded their highest levels for over a year.</p>
<p>New orders in the private housing sector in the three months to April 1997 were 23 per cent lower compared with the previous three months but three per cent higher than in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>Public housing and housing association orders were 17 per cent higher than in the previous three months but 11 per cent lower than in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Infrastructure orders in the latest three months were 25 per cent lower compared with the previous three months and 22 per cent lower on the corresponding period a year earlier.</p>
<p>Public non-housing orders (excluding infrastructure) were 20 per cent higher compared with the previous three months but ten per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago.</p>
<p>Private industrial orders were seven per cent higher than in the previous three months and 36 per cent higher compared with the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Private commercial orders in the latest three months were 17 per cent higher compared with the previous three months and 36 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year ago.</p>
<p>In current prices the total value of new orders in April was 2.192 billion stg.</p>
