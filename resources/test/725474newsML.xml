<p>The Baltic Shipyard stirred Lithuania's sleepy bourse as 16.27 percent of its shares changed hands in block trades on Monday.</p>
<p>But the central market remained mixed as investors appeared to favour top blue chips over the rest of the pack.</p>
<p>Official list shares jumped 16.23 points to 932.09 points, while group A shares fell 14.55 points to 1854.57 points.</p>
<p>"I dont think there's much of a future in list A and list B shares," said one broker, adding that investors were running to official list shares in search of quality.</p>
<p>Official list Hermis Bank advanced to 210 litas from 203.50 litas on the central market, turning over 164,000 litas. Hermis shares saw a busy 3.3 million litas worth of block trades at 195 litas to 203.50 litas a share.</p>
<p>Dealers say Hermis Bank looks fairly cheap despite a six-month result which fell a bit short of the market's expectations.</p>
<p>Rival Vilniaus Bank advanced to 240 litas from 231 litas on central market turnover of 187,000 litas.</p>
<p>The bank said on Monday its profits for the first half of the year rose to 21.4 million litas compared to 11.7 million litas in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Dealers said its result exceeded the market's expectations but were divided on the impact they would have on its price.</p>
<p>Baltic Shipyard was the centre of attention in trade of 11.4 million litas in a block trade which involved 16.27 percent of its shares.</p>
<p>Dealers did not say who was involved though speculation centres on Denmark's Odense Shipyard, which bought 40 percent of the company's shares in March.</p>
