<title>USA: Court orders tests on rifle in King assassination.</title>
<headline>Court orders tests on rifle in King assassination.</headline>
<dateline>NASHVILLE, Tenn. 1997-04-10</dateline>

<p>A court has cleared the way for tests on the rifle allegedly used to kill Martin Luther King Jr. 29 years ago, in a move that could lead to a trial for convicted assassin James Earl Ray.</p>
<p>Ray, who confessed to killing the civil rights leader but later denied it, has been trying to reopen the case. His lawyers have contended that tests on the gun would justify a new trial by showing it was not the murder weapon.</p>
<p>The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals ruled on Wednesday that a county court in Memphis, site of the 1968 assassination, may arrange for tests on the gun. That court forwarded the matter to the appeals panel in February after a hearing in which King's family urged that the case be reopened.</p>
<p>Ray's lawyers said they would move rapidly to set up the tests as soon as they receive permission from Shelby County Criminal Court Judge Joseph Brown in Memphis.</p>
<p>The rifle was found tossed in the doorway of a shop near the motel where King was shot. Ray's lawyers have said it was a "throw down" gun and not the actual murder weapon, and that Ray was a pawn in a plot to kill King.</p>
<p>Previous test firings on the rifle by the FBI and by congressional investigators were inconclusive. Ray, who is gravely ill with liver disease, was never tried because he confessed. He continues to maintain his innocence.</p>
