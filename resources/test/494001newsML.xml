<p>North American bunker prices were steady in the East Coast but up in the West Coast amid higher prices in the Far East, players said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the West Coast, demand kicked in in the Los Angeles hub, pulling 380 CST up to between $93 a tonne and $94 a tonne.</p>
<p>The demand leaked into Seattle, which was reported up $4 to $99/$100 for 380 CST. 180 CST was about $104/$105 a tonne.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of demand in the West Coast but I also think they are getting some help from higher prices in the Far East," said a U.S. trader.</p>
