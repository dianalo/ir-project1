<p>Zytec Corp shares soared more than 30 percent on Thursday after the company said it expects second quarter earnings to significantly top analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>"It certainly seemed to stimulate some interest and my guess is attract some momentum players," said Clinton Morrison, an analyst with John G. Kinnard &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Shares of Zytec closed up 5-7/8 at 25-1/8 after hitting a day's high of 25-1/4. The last time the stock topped 23 was in May 1996.  </p>
<p>Zytec said early Thursday it expects second quarter earnings to range from $0.39 to $0.41 a share, up from $0.22 a share (adjusted) in the 1996 second quarter. The company, which provides electronic power conversion equipment for the communications, networking and computer industry, said this exceeds analysts' average estimates of $0.31 a share by about 30 percent.</p>
<p>Morrison said, however, he does not expect the company to post $0.40 a share earnings in the third and fourth quarters. "It's a wonderful company, and I think it's got a lot of potential," Morrison said. "It certainly deserved a nice pop, but I have a hard time saying it deserved six bucks.... This is not the benchmark quarter."</p>
