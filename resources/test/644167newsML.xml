<title>NORWAY: Aker RGI sells Storebrand shares.</title>

<p>Norwegian industrial holding company Aker RGI ASA said on Friday it had sold 21 million preference shares in Norway's largest insurance group Storebrand ASA.</p>
<p>The company said it had sold the stock at 13.30 crowns per share.  </p>
<p>In a statement, Aker said it had sold the shares due to a decision by the Norwegian Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission that the shareholdings in Storebrand of four major investors, including Aker RGI, were to be considered as one entity.</p>
<p>The four separate shareholdings are held by billionaire Kjell Inge Roekke, his two companies Ivory Enterprises Corp and Ivory AS, as well as Aker RGI, of which Roekke is the main shareholder.</p>
<p>Under Norwegian law any single shareholder or entity is not permitted to hold more than 10 percent in a financial institution. The four entities together hold more than 16 percent of Storebrand equity.  </p>
<p>The ruling backed a decision by Storebrand's board in April to combine the four shareholdings. The measure effectively curbed the voting rights of Roekke and his associates at Storebrand's annual general meeting.</p>
<p>On Tuesday Aker RGI announced that it had appealed to the Finance Ministry against the commission's ruling.</p>
<p>Storebrand has been at odds with Roekke and Aker RGI since April when Aker RGI raised doubts about redeeming Storebrand's preference shares.</p>
<p>Aker RGI top executive Bjoern Rune Gjelsten, a close associate of Roekke, had questioned whether the rules for redeeming preference capital in Storebrand complied with securities legislation.</p>
<p>If Aker RGI's opinion prevailed, it could create problems in the proposed merger between Storebrand and Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse ASA.</p>
<p>Following the sale Aker continues to hold 2.9 million Storebrand preference shares. The company said it also had secured a right to buy back the shares, which was valid until June 6, 1998.</p>
<p>Aker said it had fixed a price of 11.60 crowns per share to buy back the stake. "For this right Aker has paid 2.62 crowns per share," it said.</p>
