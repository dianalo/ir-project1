<p>India's Congress party elected veteran leader Sitaram Kesri as its provisional president on Monday, to take the place of former Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, senior party officials said.</p>
<p>Rao resigned on Saturday after a court summons in a criminal conspiracy case. The "cheating" case involves a business magnate who alleges he paid $100,000 to an acquaintance of Rao in 1983 in a failed attempt to win a government contract.</p>
<p>Rao says he is innocent but resigned to help the party's image. The party has been plagued this year by a series of corruption scandals involving its senior leaders.</p>
<p>Party spokesman Vithal Gadgil told reporters "The Congress Working Committee (CWC) under the party constitution today appointed Sitaram Kesri as the provisional president until the All India Congress Committee elects a regular president.</p>
<p>"The decision was by consensus and it was taken in a friendly atmosphere," Gadgil said at the end of a four-hour emergency meeting of the elite CWC held at Rao's home.</p>
<p>Kesri, 76, will be a stopgap president pending the election of a new chief by the All India Congress Committee, the powerful plenary of the party, which is expected to meet sometime next month, party officials said.</p>
<p>Analysts say the selection of a provisional chief will open the door to a fight among the many contenders for the longer-term leadership as they try to rally support.</p>
<p>Infighting in the party peaked after general elections in April and May and dissidents blamed Rao for the party's worst poll debacle in history. He has been under pressure to step down ever since.</p>
<p>Rao's successor is a follower of Mahatma Gandhi, independent India's spiritual father, and is an active supporter of emancipation of India's low caste Hindus and minority Moslems.</p>
<p>Party general secretary Devendra Dwivedi said the decision to choose Kesri was taken by an overwhelming majority with a lone dissenting voice from Rajesh Pilot, a dissident leader who has been campaigning to oust Rao.</p>
<p>Rao will continue to lead Congress in parliament, where his party's support is crucial for the survival of Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's three-month-old centre-left coalition.</p>
<p>The new government is continuing an economic reform programme that Rao started in 1991, and plans to woo foreign investors are expected to continue as there is a broad consensus favouring reforms, analysts say.</p>
<p>Spokesman Gadgil said members at Monday's meeting urged Rao to reconsider his decision to quit but he declined.</p>
<p>"The CWC therefore with regret accedes to the request of Mr Rao to resign from the office of Congress President," said a resolution passed at the meeting.</p>
<p>"I have made up mind. I don't want to go to the witness box as Congress president," the United News of India (UNI), citing party sources, quoted Rao as saying.</p>
<p>Party officials said Rao consulted each CWC member separately before proposing Kesri's name.</p>
<p>The 75-year-old Rao, widely seen as lacking charisma, took charge after former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi was assassinated in 1991.</p>
<p>Kesri, party treasurer since 1979, is seen as a leader acceptable to warring factions of the party, which has ruled India for all but four years since independence from Britain in 1947.</p>
