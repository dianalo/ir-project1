<p>Gold prices looked to remain stuck in a narrow range on Friday, despite fresh turmoil in the financial markets, dealers said.</p>
<p>"We're looking for gold to trade between $368-$370 for the next couple of days. There's just not a lot going on as people want to be square towards the end of the year," a dealer said.</p>
<p>Selling from gold producers was expected to emerge on any pushes higher, while physical offtake and options-related buying was providing support below the market.</p>
<p>Bullion fixed at $369.05 an ounce, compared to $368.60 on Thursday afternoon an a London close of $368.20/$368.70.</p>
<p>A tumble on Wall Street late on Thursday offered gold a bit of strength. But values stayed below they psychological $370 area and a more dramatic setback in the stock market may be required to attract investors to gold, analysts said.</p>
<p>European stock markets slid lower in early Friday trading, prompted by the nearly 100-point drop on Wall Street, as investors took profits after a buoyant year.</p>
<p>Overall the downside was still favoured for the precious metals. Gold, which has been trending lower since February, could reasonably reach historical support areas at $365 or $362 in the next several weeks, some analysts said.</p>
<p>"Against an oversold background, prices are managing to hold over the lows and there are some signs the downtrend is slowing down," technical analyst Elli Gifford of Investment Research of Cambridge said in a commentary.</p>
<p>"However, there are no indications of any worthwhile corrective strenth emerging and further falls continue likely in due course," she added. Dealers also noted that some lending of short and medium term dates was coming into the gold market, which would help avert year-end tightness.</p>
<p>Silver and platinum were closely following gold's movements and business was thin, traders said.</p>
<p>Silver prices were off overnight highs, but still two cents firmer than Thursday's London close, at $4.83/$4.85 an ounce.</p>
<p>Platinum similarly was up $1.00 at $368.75/$369.75.</p>
<p>However, the markets were also jittery due to news of problems in annual contract negotiations between platinum producer Russia and key consumer Japan over 1997 contract sales.</p>
<p>Palladium was indicated down $1.00 at $117.75/$118.75. --Lida Poletz, London newsroom +44 171 542 2936</p>
