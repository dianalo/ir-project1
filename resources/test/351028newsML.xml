<p>Brazil will launch a 10-year 500 million deutsche mark Eurobond via lead manager CS First Boston sometime over the next two weeks, an official at the bank said.</p>
<p>"This was awarded very abruptly and the timing of the issue will be in a week or two," said the official, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>The bond would likely be priced to the German bund curve not the dollar swap and would probably come in wider than the 265 basis point spread that Brazil's 8-7/8 global due 2001 priced at in November, said the official who spoke from New York by phone.  </p>
<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell might co-manage the deal, the official said.</p>
<p>It would be Brazil's first sovereign issue since its $750 million global bond in November. Market watchers said Brazil was too late in pricing its global, missing ripe market conditions which caused that issue to trade down 30 basis points after it was launched. They say Brazil is hoping to price the mark bond while there is still strong demand for emerging market paper.</p>
<p>"I don't think they're going to miss it this time. They're right on time if they get it out in the next two weeks," said a Eurobond trader at a large international bank in Brazil.  </p>
<p>The trader said demand for Latin American paper should remain steady over the next two months. He noted that this week's meeting of Federal Reserve Board officials should not result in a U.S. interest rate hike and that the U.S. Treasury market should not see a selloff before March, both of which would support emerging market bonds.</p>
