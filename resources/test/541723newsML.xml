<headline>Italian paper says OECD sees Italy on EMU target.</headline>

<p>An Italian newspaper reported on Saturday that the OECD had forecast that Italy's deficit-GDP ratio should be below three percent in 1997 when effects of the mini-budget are calculated.</p>
<p>Turin's respected La Stampa daily reported that Treasury Ministry Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said on Friday that a draft of the OECD's June economic outlook, which is subject to revision, forecast Italy's 1997 deficit-GDP ratio to be 3.7 percent.</p>
<p>According to Ciampi, the figure fell to 2.9 percent -- just under the three percent ceiling for joining European economic and monetary union (EMU) at its planned start in 1999 -- when the effects of the deficit-slashing mini-budget were included.</p>
<p>"Italy would meet the hard-fought goal -- actually, it would be just under the difficult threshold set forth in the Maastricht Treaty," La Stampa said.</p>
<p>The paper added that the OECD economic outlook had forecast that France, Germany and Britain were likely not to meet the three percent requirement for 1997.</p>
<p>But a spokeswoman for the Paris-based Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development said there could be no confirmation of the report because the forecasts that go into the June economic outlook simply did not exist yet.</p>
<p>"We do not confirm this. We do not have those figures. They do not exist yet," the spokeswoman said in response to a query from Reuters.</p>
<p>The European Commission forecast on Wednesday that Italy's 1997 deficit would be 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), just wide of a three percent ceiling for EMU.</p>
<p>The Italian government has cried foul, accusing the Commission of double standards in its interpretation of economic data. Apart from Italy, Greece was the only country told it was in danger of failing to make the grade.</p>
