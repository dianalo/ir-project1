<p>Greece will object to any efforts to bring Turkey closer to the European Union during the European Council in Dublin in December, Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Blasting Turkey for its human rights record and perceived aggression against Greece, the outspoken minister asked for international military and economic measures against Ankara.</p>
<p>"We must find ways to convince Turkey to behave normally in the international community; military and economic measures that will force Turkey to behave in a civilised manner to its neighbours and its people," Pangalos told a news conference.</p>
<p>Greece, which has long been at odds with Turkey over territorial and minority rights issues, often points to Ankara's poor human rights record.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the London-based Amnesty International human rights group condemned Turkey for the alleged torture of children held in custody. Ankara rejected the allegations and said Amnesty was part of a campaign to sully Turkey's image internationally.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources said Pangalos was raising his objections ahead of an upcoming report by the EU's Irish presidency that is expected to call for closer EU-Turkish ties.</p>
<p>"Human rights (violations) and genocide are international crimes," Pangalos said. "No government has the right to butcher and torture its people."</p>
<p>He said that under the latest human rights report it would be a contradiction for the EU to hold meetings with Turkish officials during the summit.</p>
<p>"We consider calling any such meetings a paradox," he said. "Not everything is well between the EU and Turkey."</p>
<p>Greece also objects to a lunch planned by the Irish presidency for Turkey's Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan on the sidelines of the summit.</p>
<p>"We will be represented at the appropriate level," Pangalos said. Diplomatic sources said that meant a junior goverment official would attend the lunch to counter Turkey's positions.</p>
<p>Greek and Turkish rivalry spilled over into the Western European Union (WEU), the European Union's fledgling defence arm, on Tuesday, threatening the group's international aid missions.</p>
<p>Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller warned that Ankara would block the use of NATO equipment by the WEU because of Greek objections to giving Ankara a strong say in WEU mission planning.</p>
<p>The two countries, despite being NATO allies, almost came to war earlier this year over uninhabited islets in the Aegean. The United States stepped in to broker a deal easing the tension.</p>
