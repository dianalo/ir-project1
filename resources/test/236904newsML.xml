<p>Burma's pro-democracy opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was released from confinement at her Rangoon home on Thursday and promptly called for her country to be excluded from the regional ASEAN bloc.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi, leader of the National League for Democracy (NLD), was permitted by military rulers to attend a private wedding reception and a National Day celebration two days after she was confined.</p>
<p>She told reporters she had been illegally held at home.</p>
<p>"But today I can come back (out)," she said. "That's fine. I am always prepared to compromise, if they put a proposition to me in a civilised way."</p>
<p>Party leaders had earlier called her confinement by the military State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) "virtual house arrest".</p>
<p>SLORC officials  were not immediately available for comment. National Day is a public holiday.</p>
<p>The Nobel laureate and daughter of assassinated independence hero Aung San joined about 200 NLD members and supporters in a ceremony marking Burma's National Day at the home of an NLD leader, recalling her father's exploits, and independence in 1948 in skits and speeches.</p>
<p>Witnesses said police still kept roads leading to her lakeside house blocked off after she had returned home.</p>
<p>"As you know the barricades are up and down," she told reporters in a seemingly cheerful mood. "It's quite ridiculous. On one hand it's something that's not acceptable but on the other hand it's sometimes quite amusing."</p>
<p>The SLORC restricted Suu Kyi to her home indefinitely on Tuesday in the wake of demonstrations by students of the Yangon Institute of Technology in Rangoon.</p>
<p>"If we truly want law and order in this country, it has to be achieved through understanding, through a political settlement," Suu Kyi told reporters at the wedding reception.</p>
<p>SLORC has refused to hold a dialogue with the NLD, which won a landslide victory in the 1990 general election but was never allowed to govern.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi urged the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) not to grant Burma full membership as long as it is ruled by SLORC. She also said foreign sanctions may be imposed.</p>
<p>ASEAN said at the end of its summit in Jakarta on Saturday that it would simultaneously admit Burma, Laos and Cambodia as full members of the seven-member group, but did not say when.</p>
<p>"As I have already said, one day Burma should be a member of ASEAN because we do belong to the region," Suu Kyi said. "But for Burma under SLORC to be part of ASEAN, it will do the organisation no credit at all."</p>
<p>In answer to a question about the possibility of economic sanctions against Burma, she said: "It seems things are heading that way unless they do something to stop the repression."</p>
<p>Diplomats said Suu Kyi's confinement reflected Rangoon's concern that she might be unknowingly drawn into the 20-hour campus and street demonstration by up to 2,000 students of the Yangon Institute of Technology early this week.</p>
<p>The protest, the biggest seen in the capital since mass uprisings in 1988, was triggered by anger at police handling of a brawl between students and restaurant owners in October.</p>
<p>Suu Kyi, who was released from six years' house arrest in July last year, said the roadblocks near the NLD headquarters, which were lowered later in the day, were apparently meant to stop the party holding its meeting.</p>
<p>"This is no way to settle problems. You can't keep problems blocked up. They will just erupt in the end," she said.</p>
