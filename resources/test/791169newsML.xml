<p>Argentina's tax policy chief Monday denied press reports that the government was considering slapping new taxes on income from share dividends and interest from fixed-term bank deposits.</p>
<p>"We are not studying any taxation changes for '97 or '98," the Undersecretary for Tax Policy, Guillermo Rodriguez Use, told reporters when asked if the newspaper reports were true.  </p>
<p>Various Argentine newspapers carried front-page reports Monday saying that Vito Tanzi, head of the International Monetary Fund's fiscal department, had recommended Economy Minister Roque Fernandez make "corrections" in tax policy.</p>
<p>"The negative impact of taxes on dividends and interest has been exaggerated," Tanzi told Clarin newspaper in an interview published Monday.</p>
<p>But the new financial daily Buenos Aires Economico quoted Rodriguez Use saying "financial assets are very difficult to tax" and carried the risk of scaring away investors.</p>
<p>He told reporters at the Economy Ministry that the only changes in tax policy now under consideration are extensions to income tax and the proposed "mono-tax" to simplify the tax structure for small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
