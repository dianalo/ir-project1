<p>Briton Colin McRae won the Safari rally on Monday and jumped to the top of the championship standings.</p>
<p>McRae, driving a Subaru, finished seven minutes and four seconds ahad of fellow-Briton Richard Burns in a Mitsubishi.</p>
<p>McRae had taken the Safari lead  at the start of the second day when the first day's overnight leader German Armin Schwarz fell back with a broken suspension.</p>
<p>From then, the 1995 champion dominated proceedings as he set the fastest time on four of the day's five stages despite attempts by spectators to sabotage his challenge by placing a wall of rocks in front of his car on the sixth stage.</p>
<p>That proved to be McRae's only serious difficulty, though he suffered a minor electrical problem on the final day.</p>
<p>Kenyan Ian Duncan, in a Toyota, came in third, 11 minutes and 18 seconds behind McRae.</p>
