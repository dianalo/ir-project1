<p>Industrial services group Lemarne Corp Ltd said on Thursday it expected a sound second half from each of its three operating units.</p>
<p>Lemarne earlier reported a 66 percent rise in net profit for the six months to December 31, 1996 to A$3.09 million from A$1.87 million for the previous corresponding period.</p>
<p>Chairman Brian Noxon said reinforced plastics unit Pacific Composites lifted sales by 10 percent to A$14.5 million, while Spectra Lighting lifted sales 28 percent to A$7.2 million.  </p>
<p>Lemarne-controlled Lemvest Ltd boosted sales 64 percent to A$44.8 million, and lifted net profit to A$2.56 million from A1.78 million previously.</p>
<p>Noxon said directors were cautiously optimistic an improving trend at Lemvest's metal products unit Richardson Pacific would continue, while further growth was expected at electronics unit Com 10.</p>
<p>"Directors believe the second half (for Lemvest) should also be satisfactory and that prospects for 1997/98 look most encouraging," Noxon said.</p>
