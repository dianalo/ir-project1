<p>The French stars of a new film about their country's resistance to the Nazis during World War Two said on Thursday the story served as a warning against resurgent right-wing, racist politics -- not least in France.</p>
<p>Carole Bouquet, who played the title role in "Lucie Aubrac" about a woman who risks her life to save her resistance-fighter husband, told a news conference after the premiere at the 47th annual Berlin film festival there was still "a need to resist".</p>
<p>"Many in France ignored the uprise of Hitler and Mussolini until it affected them. Now there are four cities run by the National Front in France," she said, referring to the party's recent elections gains on an anti-immigration platform.</p>
<p>"In France some people say they (National Front) represent a few idiots, but perhaps we should take this more seriously," said Bouquet, whose face is well-known for countless Chanel perfume advertisements. Her remarks received strong applause.</p>
<p>Co-lead Daniel Auteuil who plays her husband Raymond, a Jewish resistance fighter, echoed Bouquet's view: "There are many unpleasant things rearing their heads again today -- we have to resist these disgusting things."</p>
<p>French director Claude Berri, best known for his acclaimed "Jean de Florette" and "Manon des sources", said no one was equating Jean-Marie Le Pen's National Front with Adolf Hitler's Nazi party, but his film's message applied in many countries.</p>
<p>Asked whether there was symbolic significance in unveiling the film in Berlin, the capital of Hitler's Third Reich, Berri said: "I don't want to make Germans feel guilty. It's set in that period, but I hope it will be understood universally."</p>
<p>The film is based on a book by Lucie Aubrac that recounts a tortuous nine-months of her life in 1943 which she, her husband and their child spent on the run from the Gestapo and the French collaborators of the Vichy regime in Lyon.</p>
<p>One scene shows her in disguise meeting Gestapo head Klaus Barbie, who was known as the "butcher of Lyon", in a ploy to secure her husband's release. It also depicts the deportation of French Jews to Hitler's death camps.</p>
<p>The real-life heroine Lucie Aubrac, now 84, who came to Berlin with her husband, 82, for the premiere of Berri's film told the conference that the film showed how ordinary people could show great courage under extreme circumstances.</p>
<p>"It shows how ordinary people refuse to tolerate oppression and many kinds of people refuse to accept slavery," she said of "Lucie Aubrac" -- one of 25 films competing for the top "Golden Bear" prize to be presented on Monday.</p>
