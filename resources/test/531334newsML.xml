<p>NWE naphtha was slightly softer on Wednesday in line with weaker crude prices, traders said.</p>
<p>A pipeline spec cargo for May 5-15 delivery was sold at $179 cif NWE, which compared with bids around the $180-$181 level seen on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Full-range cargoes were assessed some $1-$2 lower than this, or $1 below the May paper. On swaps, May paper was talked around $178/$179, June paper was assessed some 50 cents to $1.0 above.</p>
<p>News that Sonatrach would not be giving permission to load double stem naphtha cargoes out of Skikda for the time being was also expected to weigh on the market.</p>
<p>The Asian arbitrage door is only open for double stem cargoes at the moment, so this decision could result in a number of cargoes originally earmarked for Eastern destinations remaining in the European market, traders said.</p>
<p>"They've been given a fair amount of grief about the decision," said one player. "A lot of people have asked them to revoke the decision so we could well find it's been reversed tomorrow."</p>
