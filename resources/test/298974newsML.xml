<p>Moscow and Sofia plan to set up a joint venture, which will settle Bulgaria's payments of Russian gas supplies by barter, a senior gas official said on Friday.</p>
<p>For the last 10 years Russia has supplied Bulgaria with natural gas in return for its participation in construction works at Russia's Yambourg gas field under a 20-year intergovernmental agreement between the two countries.</p>
<p>Bulgaria, which imported 3.34 billion cubic metres (bcm) of natural gas per year against the Yambourg participation, will continue receiving the same quantities in the next 10 years but is supposed to pay for them in cash.</p>
<p>"We are in a process of establishing a Bulgarian-Russian joint venture, which will operate a barter deal of Russian gas supplies for Bulgarian goods," Petar Sabev, executive director of Bulgaria's state-owned Bulgargas told Reuters.</p>
<p>Bulgaria has offered Russia's Gazprom a list of goods and services to be supplied to Russia against part of the gas. The list includes medicines, cigarettes, spirits and fork lift trucks.</p>
<p>Sabev said in an interview that the two sides will share the stakes in the planned venture, whose headquarters would be in Moscow.</p>
<p>Bulgargas will have 40 percent in the venture and Bulgaria's Biochim Bank will hold a 10 percent stake. The Russian side will be represented by Stolichnii Bank Sberejenie with 10 pecent stake and a Russian firm, which Sabev did not name, will hold the remaining 40 percent.</p>
<p>A Bulgarian delegation starts negotiations in Moscow on Tuesday for delivering the remaining 1.2 bcm of Russian gas under the first 10-year agreement during the current winter but not during the whole year, Sabev said.</p>
<p>Apart from the annual supplies under the agreement with Russia, in 1997 Bulgaria is expected to import another three bcm of Russian gas, Sabev said.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian-Russian joint gas stock company Topenergy, in which Gazprom has a 50 percent participation, will supply 2.5 million cubic metres and the remaining 500 million will come from a German firm, he added.</p>
<p>Sabev said his company was planning to propose to potential investors the establishment of a stock company with Bulgargas participation for the construction of a new underground storage facility, expected to cost $120 million.</p>
<p>Plans are to build a facility using abandoned salt caverns in the village of Mirovo near the industrial area of Devnya in northeastern Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Energy officials said Turkey, which receives Russian gas for the last nine years via Bulgaria, was interested in using a storage facility in Bulgaria in a bid to overcome sharp falls in supplies during cold winters.</p>
