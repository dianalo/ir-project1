<p>IPE Brent crude oil futures fell in early trading on Monday on poor refinery margins and fears of a pre-expiry dump on June NYMEX crude, brokers said.</p>
<p>July Brent was down 26 cents a barrel at $19.90 at 0945 GMT, well below a high of $20.60 seen last Friday after a 10-day rally.</p>
<p>"Margins are very poor indeed and people feel that crude demand may suffer," said a broker.</p>
<p>Fears of a big fall on June NYMEX crude was also undermining confidence in Brent. The June NYMEX contract expires at the close of business on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Refiners in the U.S. don't want to take delivery of foreign crudes into the expiry, the broker added.</p>
<p>"People are paying 20 cents over the screen" to ensure they get delivery of West Texas Intermediate rather than imported crudes, he said.</p>
<p>Technically Brent looked fragile having broken below $19.93 early. Further support was around the $19.50 level heavily traded area last week.</p>
<p>"There could be some pressure on the June WTI ahead of expiry and this may spill over (to Brent) if it is dramatic," said brokers GNI in a daily report.</p>
<p>"Only a move below trend support at $19.85 would really concern us," GNI added.</p>
<p>Turning to this weeks U.S. API sotck figures due out late on Tuesday they said "the market expects to see consistent stock draws over the next few periods in order to improve current price levels,"</p>
<p>IPE June gas oil was down $2.50 a tonne at $175.25 at 1001 GMT after breaking below $175.75 support.</p>
<p>Premiums for Rotterdam barges held around $2.50 a tonne above the IPE contract for loading up to June 15.</p>
