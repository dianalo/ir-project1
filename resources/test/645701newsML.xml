<p>Temperatures dropped sharply Saturday night/early Sunday morning in Brazil's coffee regions but cooperatives and weather stations did not report any frosts early Sunday.</p>
<p>"It was around 10 degrees (Celsius) at midnight but then dropped sharply to five degrees early in the morning," said an official at the weather station in Presidente Prudente, southwest Sao Paulo state.</p>
<p>In regions such as north Parana and highland areas of south Minas Gerais state, temperatures also fell to five degrees from minimum temperatures on Saturday morning of 13 degrees.</p>
<p>The cooler temperatures are due to the arrival of a polar air mass which, although not particularly strong, is coming in overland and therefore carries more impact than other fronts arriving from the sea.</p>
<p>Weather forecasters in Brazil and the U.S are predicting cold temperatures for the coffee regions over the coming days but no damaging frosts are expected.</p>
<p>Early morning/minimum temperatures in key regions on Sunday were as follows.</p>
