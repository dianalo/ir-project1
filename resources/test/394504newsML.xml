<p>At least 130 people were feared drowned after a trawler carrying 150 Tamil refugees to India capsized in the Mannar sea off northern Sri Lanka, Tamil rebel radio said on Friday.</p>
<p>The clandestine rebel radio, monitored in the northern town of Vavuniya, said 20 refugees and two crew were rescued but the rest were feared killed when the trawler sank late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The radio said 85 bodies, mostly of women and children, had been recovered and 62 had been identified.</p>
<p>It said the trawler had gone barely a mile before it capsized. It did not say why it capsized or who was carrying out rescue operations.</p>
<p>A navy spokesman told Reuters in Colombo that the navy was aware of the incident but had no details on the rescue.</p>
<p>"Our craft are operating in the area and have been informed to do whatever possible," the spokesman said. "But we don't have details right now," he added.</p>
<p>Navy officials said the boat had left Nachchikudah, a fishing village north of the town of Mannar late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mannar, 240 km (150 miles) north of the capital Colombo, and the island of Talaimannar north of the town are controlled by the army while the surrounding areas are controlled by the rebels.</p>
<p>The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in this predominantly Sinhalese Indian Ocean island.</p>
<p>The political wing of the LTTE asked all Tamils to mourn the deaths by flying black flags.</p>
<p>"We request all the Tamils to observe a day of mourning on Saturday the 22nd, to respect the Tamils who died in the sea drowning while they tried to escape the Sinhalese forces who are engaged in Edi Bala (brave force) operations and also their attacks," they said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have been killed in the war, now in its 14th year. The LTTE says the number is much higher.</p>
