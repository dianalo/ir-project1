<p>Duff &amp; Phelps Credit Rating Co expects Mexico's inflation rate to decline to about 18 percent and GDP growth to reach 4.5 percent at yearend 1997, according to a new Credit Analysis report on the country by the rating agency.</p>
<p>Mexico's fiscal discipline and tight monetary policies successfully abated inflation and interest rates in 1996, noted Duff &amp; Phelps vice president Andres O'Bryne, author of the report.</p>
<p>Duff &amp; Phelps Credit Rating currently rates Mexico's long-term foreign currency obligations Double B and believes the economic outlook for the country is stable.</p>
<p>"The economy's vulnerability to unexpected shocks has been considerably reduced," O'Bryne said in the report.</p>
<p>Duff &amp; Phelps also said it views Mexico's recent electoral reforms as positive. "The improvement in Mexico's electoral system and overall political reform will benefit the country in the medium to long term," O'Bryne added.</p>
