<p>At least 14 people were killed when Hutu rebels attacked a camp for displaced people in Burundi's north-western Bubanza region, the Tutsi-dominated army said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The attack on Tuesday at Bubanza's Ngara camp left seven displaced people, six rebels and one soldier dead and eight civilians wounded, an army spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Independent confirmation of the attack was not immediately available.</p>
<p>"The displaced (people's) camp was mainly for Hutus. There were some other rebels killed, but they took their bodies away. We recovered one weapon and some grenades," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Asked why Hutu rebels would attack a Hutu camp, he said: "This is a question you must go and ask them. Wherever (people) co-operate with the army, the rebels kill them."</p>
<p>Rebels are blamed for the assassination of Burundi's most senior Catholic cleric, Archbishop Joachim Ruhuna, on Monday who was killed in an ambush on his car in central Burundi. At least one nun and two other people were also killed in the attack.</p>
<p>Around 150,000 people have died in Burundi since 1993 when the country's first democratically elected Hutu president was assassinated in an attempted coup.</p>
