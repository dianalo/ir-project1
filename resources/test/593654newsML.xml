<p>India's main opposition party, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said on Sunday it opposed a proposal for a working group from India and Pakistan to discuss the future of divided Kashmir.</p>
<p>"There is no need to form such a group. Our party is opposed to the formation of such a group," Atal Behari Vajpayee, BJP leader and former prime minister, said as he waved off a cross-country march by party president Lal Krishna Advani.</p>
<p>Last week, Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif agreed to set up working groups to discuss issues, including Kashmir, dividing the two long-standing rivals.</p>
<p>The two prime ministers met in the Maldivian capital of Male on the sidelines of a South Asian summit there.</p>
<p>Vajpayee told dozens of saffron-clad party workers that if there is any discussion at all on Kashmir, it should be to regain control of the Pakistan-occupied part of the Himalayan region.</p>
<p>India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since independence from Britain in 1947. India controls two-thirds of Kashmir -- and is fighting a separatist revolt there -- and Pakistan the rest.</p>
<p>Advani's "Swarna Jayathi Rath Yatra", or golden jubilee march, covers 15,000 km (9,375 miles) across 15 states and one union territory and is to mark 50 years of independence from Britain.</p>
<p>Analysts said the 55-day trip, ending on July 1 in New Delhi, is a thinly veiled start to the party's campaign to woo The largest single group in parliament's lower house, the BJP is racing to position itself for mid-term elections it is convinced will be called later this year.</p>
<p>"Naturally the impact of it (the march) will go to build the image of the party," BJP vice-president Jana Krishnamurthy told Reuters in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Opinion polls favour the BJP, which now holds 162 of the 545 seats in the Lok Sabha lower house, in the event of an election.</p>
<p>BJP leaders say they are convinced Gujral's centre-left coalition is short-lived and will tumble by the year end.</p>
<p>Thousands of the BJP's saffron and green flags dotted the route out of the commercial capital as Advani and his convoy of cars, buses, taxis and two-wheelers took off on their journey.</p>
<p>Advani, seated on a gaily decorated chariot mounted on a truck, told the crowd that India must be rid of all corruption.</p>
<p>"I feel very bad when I look at what 50 years of independence has done to India. We are still not free or self-reliant. If you vote the BJP to power at the centre, I promise a clean government which will make India self-reliant and free."</p>
<p>India's political arena has been mired in corruption scandals that has plagued the the former ruling Congress party and now constituents of Gujral's coalition government.</p>
