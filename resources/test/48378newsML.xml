<p>Precious and industrial metals prices are sagging as speculators decide that they are bored by these markets unless, as in gold, they spot a chance to make money with technical plays exploiting weakness.</p>
<p>Against historical precedent, a surge by crude oil to post-Gulf War highs at almost $24.40 per barrel -- on renewed tension between Iraq and the United States -- wasn't mimicked by gold on Thursday. No longer an investor "safe haven" in times of stress or of inflationary pressure, gold in London barely clung to support just above $380 per ounce on Thursday.</p>
<p>One leading analyst, Andy Smith of Union Bank of Switzerland, predicted it could tumble to $365 by the end of the year before a rebound in 1997.</p>
<p>Smith based his view for gold on widening open interest on the New York Comex gold futures market.</p>
<p>Speculators are selling big futures volumes short in the hope they can buy back cheaper and pocket the profit.</p>
<p>Elsewhere the metals sector languished under an exit of speculative fund money apparently based on a view that the global economy will not be robust enough to generate strong industrial demand.</p>
<p>Palladium, the rare white metal used in electronics and catalytic converters, was quoted as low as $120.55 per ounce, its weakest since December 1993.</p>
<p>Pressure built on industrial metal markets when the price of copper fell conclusively below $1,900 per tonne on the London Metal Exchange (LME) late on Wednesday. Copper hasn't recovered from the mid-June scandal at Sumitomo Corp of Japan when the company fired its star trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, alleging that he ran up losses of $1.8 billion on maverick copper trades. Hamanaka had been using a throttle on stocks to defend a long position and firm price. More generally, speculators have opted to sell the non-ferrous metals on a view that end-user demand is weaker than it should be at the end of the northern hemisphere summer holiday lull, say traders. Fabricators, mills and other users have continued to de-stock, operating off their own working inventories. Aluminium hit a two-year low around $1,430 per tonne this week. Other metals like zinc, lead, nickel and tin look shaky.</p>
<p>"There is insufficient demand in the market at the moment to hold the bears at bay...</p>
<p>"Moreover, we have not seen the necessary rise in U.S demand following the Labor Day holiday nor in Europe," brokerage GNI Ltd said in a daily commentary.</p>
<p>On Thursday Anglo-Australian metals giant RTZ-CRA reported a 22 percent slide in net adjusted earnings to $552 million in the first half of 1996, blaming weak metal prices, above all copper.</p>
<p>The company added, however, that in its view the present decline in base metals prices is temporary. It believed that the outlook for all base metals, with the probable exception of copper, was bullish over the remainder of 1996 and through 1997.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in commodity markets on Thursday, profit-taking curbed the rally on crude oil that was triggered by latest tensions between the United States and Iraq. Benchmark North Sea Brent Blend crude oil futures for October traded around $23.70 per barrel late in London's afternoon after a surge to $24.39.</p>
<p>Wheat prices fell again on the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). Already down from an all-time high in March at $7.50 per bushel, the nearby wheat futures contract eased to below $4.40 against a backdrop of bigger world harvests this year.</p>
