<p>Welsh international striker Dean Saunders said on Thursday that fears regarding his five-year-old daughter Louisa's health prompted him to quit Turkish club Galatasaray halfway through a two-year contract.</p>
<p>Saunders, who moved to English premier league Nottingham Forest in the close-season, explained: "Louisa suffers with asthma and in Istanbul in the winter people burn cheap fuel which causes a smog.</p>
<p>"Needless to say that didn't help her at all and she ended up in hospital suffering with pneumonia and bronchitis.</p>
<p>"When I saw Louisa with her chest wired up to a machine and an oxygen mask on, I really knew it was time to head home.</p>
<p>"It was a worrying time for us all and really that convinced me to leave Galatasaray. I had still 12 months to go of my contract but the club were very understanding."</p>
<p>Saunders, whose daughter has since made a full recovery, has made a slow start to life at Nottingham with one goal in the opening eight league matches but still feels his spell in Turkey has made him a better player.</p>
<p>He said: "I learnt a great deal out there. They play with man markers, something I'd only ever experienced before when with Wales. It took me a while to adapt, but I'm sure the experience is standing me in good stead."</p>
