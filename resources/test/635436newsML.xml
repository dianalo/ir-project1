<p>The Tokyo stock market's benchmark Nikkei average closed at a new high for 1997, ending above the 20,500 threshold for the first time since December.</p>
<p>Brokers said strength in stock futures and continued interest in high-technology issues, especially laggards, boosted the index.</p>
<p>The 225-share Nikkei average finished the session at 20,563.16, up 111.31 points or 0.54 percent. It was the highest close since 20,568.38 on December 11.</p>
<p>Nikkei 225 June futures closed at 20,560, up 120 points.</p>
<p>"Futures were especially firm and so were laggards in the high-technology sector," said Tadahiro Kamogawa, Yamaichi Securities general manager. "But there was also pressure from profit-taking, keeping a tight rein on gains."</p>
