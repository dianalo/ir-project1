<p>Finnish national carrier Finnair Oy said on Friday that it aimed for better operating earnings in the financial year to end-March 1998 than in 1996-97 and it unveiled a plan to buy at least 12 new Airbus aircraft.</p>
<p>In 1996-97, Finnair's operating profit fell to 326 million markka ($62.9 million) from 624 million. It said operating profit fell 48 percent with turnover up 3.0 percent and costs rising 8.4 percent. Fuel costs rose 29 percent, it said.</p>
<p>Looking at 1997-98, Finnair said growth in demand for air transport services was expected to be at the 1996-97 level. Finnair's 1996-97 passenger volume increased 5.3 percent.</p>
<p>"The number of passengers in both domestic and international traffic during the first months of the current financial year have been substantially higher than those of 1996-97," it said.</p>
<p>"Because of the intense competition, prices are not expected to rise."</p>
<p>Group profit before extraordinary items and tax fell 42 percent to 310 million markka in 1996-97. The board proposed an unchanged 1.00 markka dividend.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, Finnair announced it had decided to buy 12 new aircraft from European Airbus Industries and had an option to buy 24 more aircraft of the same 320 series.</p>
<p>Finnair's choice had been between Airbus and U.S. Boeing Co, it said.</p>
<p>"The total value of the purchase to be divided over three financial years is about two billion markka," Finnair said.</p>
<p>The exact value of the deal would be clear when Finnair had decided which of the Airbus 320 series' three models -- the 126-seat A319, the 153-seat A320 and the 188-seat A321 -- it would buy.</p>
<p>"The planes of the Airbus 320 family are very well suited for Finnair's traffic," it said in the statement.</p>
<p>Finnair said it expected to have the first two new aircraft -- both the A321s -- in traffic at the start of 1999.</p>
<p>With the acquisition, Finnair will modernise its fleet of narrow body, medium range aircraft used mainly on scheduled European routes. The 12 Airbus aircraft will replace as many ageing 121-seat DC9 aircraft.</p>
<p>The option for a further 24 aicraft is for the later replacement of its 25 MD80 aircraft, Finnair said.</p>
<p>"The choice of engine type has been postponed for the time being for a later a decision," it said. Both alternatives under consideration meet required noise and emission standards and, "both consume significantly less fuel than the twin jet engines currently in use."</p>
<p>Finnair said the engines under consideration were the CFM-56 made by French state-owned aerospace group SNECMA in cooperation with U.S. General Electric Co and the IAE-2500 built by a consortium grouping U.S. Pratt &amp; Whitney, Britain's Rolls-Royce, Germany's MTU and a Japanese company.</p>
