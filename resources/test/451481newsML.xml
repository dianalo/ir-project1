<p>Hanoi will keep diplomatic pressure on China to halt drilling operations in a potentially gas-rich offshore area which Vietnam claims as its own, a senior official at the state oil and gas company said on Tuesday. The Petrovietnam official, who declined to be named, said Hanoi wanted to find a peaceful solution to the row which broke at the weekend, but would continue to protest.</p>
<p>"Of course we continue (protesting) until they withdraw from this area," he said. "It's Vietnamese waters."</p>
<p>Both countries laid claim on Monday to the area off the central coast of Vietnam, where industry analysts say China has been drilling for some time.</p>
<p>A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry said the Kan Tan III drilling rig was in Chinese waters and that its activities were both normal and above reproach.</p>
<p>Vietnam said at the weekend it had formally protested to Beijing over the drilling operation, demanding an immediate withdrawal of the exploration vessel and accompanying tugs.</p>
<p>The official Vietnam News Agency said coastguards had repeatedly cautioned the Chinese vessels that they were encroaching on foreign territorial waters, but their warnings were ignored. Vietnamese navy officials declined to comment on the latest situation on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Petrovietnam official said this was not the first time that Hanoi had protested over Chinese drilling in an area which is marked on Vietnamese maps as Block 113.</p>
<p>He said Petrovietnam had carried out a seismic survey itself in Block 113 last year and had been planning to explore there at a later stage.</p>
<p>Industry analysts, noting that Block 113 is partly overlapped by a Chinese-designated block called LD28-1, say the maritime border in that area is ill-defined.</p>
