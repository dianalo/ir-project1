<text>
<p>The following is the weekly crop summary from the Kansas Agricultural Statistics Service for the week ending August 3.</p>
<p>	 SCATTERED SHOWERS AND COOLER TEMPERATURES WELCOME</p>
<p>Scattered showers and cooler temperatures were a welcome relief across the State, according to Kansas Agricultural Statistics and the Kansas State University Extension Service.  Most areas still need more rain as fall crop conditions remained mostly unchanged. Corn condition is reported as 18 percent excellent, 52 percent good, 23 percent fair, 6 percent poor, and 1 percent very poor (see table 1). Ninety-eigpercent but ahead of the average of 88 percent. Currently, 43 percent of the corn is in the dough stage.</p>
<p>This compares to 61 percent last year and the average of 38 percent.  Eight percent of the crop is dented.  Sorghum condition is reported as 16 percent excellent, 55 percent good, 23 percent fair, 5 percent poor, and 1 very poor.  Sorghum headed is 46 percent complete, the same as 1996 but ahead of the five-year average at 29 percent.  Four percent of the sorghum crop is coloring.  Soybean condition is 17 percent excellent, 58 percent good, 21 percent fair, and 4 percent poor.  Eight-six percent of the soybean crop is blooming, ahead of 1996 at 84 percent and the average of 65 percent.  Statewide, 40 percent of the crop is setting pods, compared to 36 percent in 1996 and 26 percent for the average.  Condition of the sunflower crop is 5 percent excellent, 54 percent good, 28 percent fair, 10 percent poor, and 3 percent very poor.  Sixty-two percent of the sunflower crop has begun to petal statewide.  In the Northwest district, 52 percent of the crop has begun to petal.  Statewide twenty-three percent of the crop has begun to bloom, but in the Northwest district only, 6 percent of the crop is blooming.</p>
<p>Third cutting of alfalfa is 71 percent complete, compared to the previous year at 64 percent and 45 percent for the five-year average.  Fourth cutting is 4 percent complete.</p>
<p>Statewide, there were 5.2 days suitable for fieldwork during the week (see table 3).  The major field activities this week were irrigating, working wheat stubble, and cutting alfalfa.  Topsoil moisture is rated 5 percent very short, 35 percent short, 59 percent adequate, and 1 percent surplus.  Subsoil moisture is rated 4 percent very short, 31 percent short, 64 percent adequate, and 1 percent surplus.</p>
<p>Pasture condition for the State is rated 7 percent excellent, 50 percent good, 31 percent fair, 9 percent poor, and 3 percent very poor.  Some cattle are beginning to move off of grass.  Stock water supplies remain mostly adequate.</p>
