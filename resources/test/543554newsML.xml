<p>The Banking Superintendency took halting steps Monday to ease a mounting debt crisis affecting the stability of savings and loan institutions and hundreds of thousands of Colombians</p>
<p>Colombia's nine savings and loans have a loan portfolio totalling nearly 10 trillion pesos and a huge 1.3 trillion of that consists of past due obligations. Underscoring the extent of the problem, newspaper El Tiempo said Colpatria, the fifth largest S&amp;L, saw its past due loan portfolio jump over 330 percent last year as sky-high interest rates forced a growing number of Colombians to default on home loans and other debts.  </p>
<p>Most other S&amp;Ls, including the top two, saw past due loan portfolios grow by more than 100 percent in 1996 and at least 700,000 Colombians now face legal action because they either defaulted, or fell behind on their payments to S&amp;Ls.</p>
<p>To ease the problem, the Banking Superintendency announced that debtors would no longer be required to pay back 10 percent of principal to refinance past-due loans.</p>
<p>But the measure, which had been widely expected, was described by some analysts as little more than an offer of aspirin for someone who is seriously ill since interest rates remain extremely high and unemployment is at a nine-year high.  </p>
<p>Banking Superintendent Maria Luisa Chiappe conceded that some debtors, following the example of a group known as "El Barzon" in Mexico, were talking about organizing a debtors' strike to force the government to provide more protection and relief from usurious interest rates. But she said this would likely hurt people with small savings accounts in S&amp;Ls more than anyone else and offered no long-term solution.</p>
<p>Speaking at a news conference, Chiappe did not say how many debtors might qualify for refinancing now that the 10 percent principal payment was no longer a pre-requirement. But she acknowledged that not everyone stood to benefit.</p>
<p>"The debtor (seeking refinancing) will have to show that his income situation has improved," she said. "Someone who continues to be unemployed can't expect a restructuring of his debt because he wouldn't have the income to deal with it."</p>
<p>To prevent the crisis from spiraling out of control, Chiappe said the government was considering ordering S&amp;Ls to take out unemployment insurance to cover most past due loans in the future.</p>
