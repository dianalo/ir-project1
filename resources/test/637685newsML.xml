<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday congratulated Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien on his narrow election victory.</p>
<p>Chretien's Liberals on Monday won just 155 of the 301 seats in Parliament, four more than a majority. The new Parliament will have five official parties.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton and Chretien had a warm, 11-minute telephone call in which Clinton congratulated Chretien.</p>
<p>They discussed the agenda for next month's summit in Denver of the world's seven largest industrial democracies, the Group of Seven, and the July summit of NATO countries in Madrid, he said.</p>
<p>"We have a very close working relationship with the government of Canada and the United States has long enjoyed very close relations with a strong and unified Canada," McCurry said.</p>
<p>"We will continue to pursue those issues that we work together with the government on as they relate to matters we are dealing with currently in Europe and in this hemispshere where we do so much work with the government of Canada," he said.</p>
