<p>Inspired by Wall Street's recovery after Thursday's slide, Chilean blue chips ended stronger with drug-maker LabChile among leading gainers, said traders.</p>
<p>The bolsa is expected to open steady with the market looking to recover its footing after several erratic sessions, they said.</p>
<p>"We expect volume to be flat, although prices could rise gently at the start of the week," said one dealer.</p>
<p>The 40-share index ended up 0.44 percent at 116.07 points.  </p>
<p>The general index gained 0.01 percent to 5,340.53 points.</p>
<p>Turnover remained steady at 14.7 billion pesos, with the healthy turnover reflecting revived interest from foreign investors and steady buying from local institutional players.</p>
<p>Traders said the bolsa's mild rebound indicated that the market has found support at 115 points.</p>
<p>Chile's largest pharmaceutical company LabChile surged on news the company has signed a $60 million syndicated loan to repay short-term debts, said dealers.</p>
<p>Its stock rose 2.35 percent to 435 pesos.  </p>
<p>Other rises included telecom Entel, up 1.43 percent at 2,840 pesos, and power utility Chilgener, which gained 1.1 percent to 2,750 pesos.</p>
<p>Losers included copper products maker Madeco, down 2.14 percent at 1,145 pesos, and glass producer Cristales , which shed 0.7 percent to 2,850 pesos.</p>
