<headline>CBS says names Moonves as TV president.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBS Inc said Thursday that Leslie Moonves, the television network's top programming executive, was promoted to the post of president of CBS Television.</p>
<p>The company also said that Jim Warner, president of the CBS Television Network, has resigned, and the position has been eliminated.  CBS said Warner will remain with the network for several months to assist in the transition.</p>
<p>CBS is a unit of Westinghouse Electric Corp.  </p>
<p>As part of the promotion, Moonves was given responsibility for marketing, sales and consumer research, and will oversee CBS Productions, CBS Enterprises and Eyemark Entertainment, which includes domestic syndication and international sales units.</p>
<p>Moonves will keep his responsibilities as president of CBS Entertainment.</p>
<p>Michael Jordan, chairman and chief executive of parent Westinghouse Electric Corp, said that Moonves was also named to the CBS Executive Committee.  </p>
<p>The committee consists of Mel Karmazin, chairman and chief executive of the CBS station group; Fredric Reynolds, CBS chief financial officer; Moonves; and Jordan.</p>
<p>According to a CBS spokesman, Moonves, in his new role, assumes some of Warner's duties -- including sales and research.  Affiliate relations will supervised by Jordan.</p>
<p>CBS said the following executives will report to Jordan: Moonves; Karmazin; Andrew Heyward, president of CBS News; Sean McManus, president of CBS Sports; Don Mitzner, president of CBS Cable; and Peter Schruth, senior vice president and general manager, affiliate relations.  </p>
<p>CBS said the announcements were part of a corporate restructuring in advance of the conversion of Westinghouse into CBS Corp this fall after the spinoff of Westinghouse's industrial businesses.</p>
<p>"Leslie Moonves has played the major role in the turnaround of the CBS Television Network," Jordan said in a statement. "We're now giving him the opportunity to apply his unique business and creative talents beyond programming development to the total business performance of the CBS Television Network."</p>
<p>In Moonves's new job, he will assume the areas that were once overseen by Peter Lund, who abruptly resigned from the network in May as president of the TV and cable group.</p>
<p>Lund's resignation came when Westinghouse gave responsibility over the stations group to Karmazin, a major Westinghouse shareholder and board member.  Karmazin had run Infinity Broadcasting before it was bought by Westinghouse last year.</p>
<p>Lund resigned on May 22, the same day Moonves unveiled the fall primetime lineup to advertisers.  Since then, there has been speculation that Moonves would get expanded duties.</p>
