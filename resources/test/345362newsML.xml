<p>Malaysia's Quality Concrete Holdings Bhd is looking at integration, mergers and acquisitions, its chairman Effendi Norwawi said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We are looking at upstream and downstream linkages and even looking at mergers and acquisitions," he told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>He said there was enormous potential for the company's two main areas of business, construction related products and plastics. Quality Concrete is based in Malaysia's Sarawak state on Borneo island.</p>
<p>Concrete and other cement products will be in great demand in the fast growing infrastructure sector of the country, while the plastics division could move into autoparts and telecommunications business, Effendi said.</p>
<p>However, the surge in growth will come after an initial lag period.</p>
<p>"For a year or two it will remain at the present level (of forecasts) because there will be a gestation period while we plan and execute these strategies," he said.  </p>
<p>"But, I think in the next three to five years, this company should be transformed into a different entity," said Effendi, who holds 45 percent of Quality Concrete through his company Encorp Properties.</p>
<p>Since its listing on the Second Board of Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange on November 14, 1996, at two ringgit a share, Quality Concrete has risen to a high of 16.2 ringgit.</p>
<p>At the midday break on Thursday, the share was trading at 15.3 ringgit.</p>
<p>In its listing prospectus, the company has forecast a net profit of 5.02 million ringgit for the year ended December 31, 1996, against 4.46 million in 1995. In 1997, the net profit is expected to be 5.91 million ringgit.</p>
