<p>Newfoundland Premier Brian Tobin on Monday said the Canadian province wants to renegotiate a 20-year-old contract on its long-term sale of electricity to Hydro-Quebec.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters in the Newfoundland legislature, Tobin said that by 2001, the cash-strapped province would be forced to subsidize its Churchill Falls (Labrador) Corp electricity generating complex.  </p>
<p>This would happen mainly because under a contract negotiated in the late 1960s, Churchill Falls sells 90 percent of its power output to the Quebec government-owned Hydro-Quebec, which resells the power at much higher rates to customers in Quebec and the northeastern United States.</p>
<p>"I'm saying to the people of Hydro-Quebec and those using Churchill Falls power that the power will not flow in the way it is flowing now, if this contract is not renegotiated," Tobin said.</p>
<p>"The province of Newfoundland and Labrador will not stand by and bankrupt itself," he said.  </p>
<p>At issue in Tobin's veiled threat to cut off the power supply is a contract which came into effect in 1976 and runs for 65 years. Under the contract Churchill Falls agreed to sell electricity to Hydro-Quebec at a predetermined rate that is set to steadily decline over the years.</p>
<p>Churchill Falls spokesman Don Barrett told Reuters that the Newfoundland government-owned utility is on the verge of losing money on the contract.</p>
<p>"Our current projections are that the year-end cash balances will be zero in the year 2001 and in the following two years will continue at zero or negative value," he said.  </p>
<p>Tobin said that in 1995, the province received royalties and dividends of C$16.5 million under the contract.</p>
<p>Newfoundland owns two-thirds of Churchill Falls, while Hydro-Quebec owns one-third. Churchill Falls has a rated capacity of 5,420 megawatts.  </p>
<p>Barrett said that one key clause of the contract stipulates that if Churchill Falls has difficulty paying its debt and operating expenses, it could demand financial assistance from Hydro-Quebec. In return for each C$1,000 of assistance, Hydro-Quebec would get five common shares and a debenture of Churchill Falls.</p>
<p>"Conceiveably, over time, Hydro-Quebec, which is currently a one-third shareholder, could become the majority shareholder," Barrett said.  </p>
<p>Under the contract with Hydro-Quebec, in addition to selling 225 megawatts of power to Twin Falls, Churchill Falls has a recall provision on 300 megawatts of power, of which it is using 162 megawatts. The 138 megawatts left under the recall provision could be sold elsewhere, after providing three years' notice to Hydro-Quebec, Barrett said.</p>
<p>Newfoundland has failed in previous attempts, including appeals to the Supreme Court of Canada, to reopen the Churchill Falls contract.  </p>
<p>Under the contract, Churchill Falls currently sells electricity to Hydro-Quebec at 2.7 mils, or 2.7 tenths of a Canadian cent for each kilowatt. In 1995, Churchill Fall's export sales to Hydro-Quebec were 26.7 million kilowatt-hours.</p>
<p>Churchill Falls also provides 225 megawatts of power to its-one-third-owned Twin Falls Power Corp, which is used mainly by iron ore companies operating in Labrador. Those companies, including units operated by Dofasco Inc, Iron Ore of Canada, and Wabush Iron Ore Company have minority interests in Twin Falls.  </p>
<p>On Saturday, Quebec's separatist premier Lucien Bouchard said Quebec would not renegotiate the contract and that under the law, Newfoundland was compelled to abide by the agreement.</p>
<p>The power controversy comes as both Quebec and Newfoundland are struggling to meet fiscal deficit targets in the face of high unemployment and sluggish economies.</p>
<p>Hydro-Quebec is under government orders to cut C$198 million of its operating expenses in the current fiscal year. It is forecasting a net profit of C$516 million in 1996, compared with $390 million in 1995. The profit is paid as a dividend to the Quebec government.</p>
