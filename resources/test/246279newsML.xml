<p>Several international environmental groups on Tuesday condemned the failure of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) environment panel to produce significant results in the last two years.</p>
<p>The groups said the trade body's Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE) was doing just that and "effectively hijacking the environmental debate in pursuance of national trade interests".</p>
<p>The CTE was formed in April 1994 at the Marrakesh meeting where the Uruguay Round agreement was signed.</p>
<p>According to a WTO statement, the CTE has brought environmental and sustainable development issues into the maintstream of WTO work.</p>
<p>The CTE's first report, which is being submitted to this week's WTO ministerial meeting in Singapore, noted that the world body is interested in building a constructive relationship between trade and environmental concerns.</p>
<p>The WTO statement also said that an open and equitable multilateral trading system has a key contribution to make to international efforts to better protect and conserve environmental resources and promote sustainable development.</p>
<p>In its joint statement, the environmental groups called on the WTO member governments in Singapore "to seize this opportunity to inject clarity and urgency into the international debate on trade and environment."</p>
<p>The groups include Greenpeace International, the Centre for International Environmental Law, Eurogroup for Animal Welfare, FIVAS (Norway), Friends of the Earth International, Humane Society International, Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy (U.S.), Peoples' Forum 2001 (Japan), Sierra Club and World Wide Fund for Nature International.</p>
<p>They also want the WTO to reaffirm the legitimacy of existing multilateral environmental agreements as instruments which operate independently of the WTO.</p>
<p>The agreements include the Convention on International Trade on Endangered Species, the Basle Convention, the Montreal Protocol, Climate Change Convention and the Biodiversity Convention.</p>
