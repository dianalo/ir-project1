<headline>UK's Energy prospects good, hard to value.</headline>

<p>Energy Group, set to debut officially on the London stock exchange on Monday after its demerger from Hanson Plc, has good growth prospects but remains difficult to value because of its diversity, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>"I genuinely think if there is a chance of growth this is it, but valuing Energy is difficult because it is a very different animal from other utility stocks," said one analyst who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Energy is the last part of Anglo-U.S. conglomerate Hanson to become a separate company following last October's spin-off of Imperial Tobacco and U.S.-quoted Millenium Chemicals.</p>
<p>It will join a sector which has been whittled down by take-overs over the last two years, as regional electricity companies (Recs) were snapped up to leave just two out of an original twelve created at privatisation in 1990.</p>
<p>Energy owns Eastern, Britain's fourth largest electricity generator and distribution business, along with U.S.-Australian Peabody Coal.</p>
<p>It will be large enough to rank among Britain's top 100 blue chips and the Fortune 500 in the U.S., where it will also be quoted.</p>
<p>Energy's demerger, which offers shareholders one Energy share for every 10 existing Hanson shares held, was approved by shareholders on Friday, leaving Hanson with building services businesses.</p>
<p>Energy shares on the so-called "grey market" were trading around 520 pence by 1146 GMT on Friday and analysts said official trading would kick off at similar levels.</p>
<p>"We think 530 pence is about right, maybe a little lower," one analyst said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the diversity of the company's interests made it difficult to value or find comparisons for.</p>
<p>"It is a hybrid, but it probably sits most comfortably in the UK market with an integrated power company such as Scottish Power," said David Campbell, analyst at Craig Middleton.</p>
<p>He added that Energy's integrated British power business was one of its potential strengths.</p>
<p>In addition, analysts said the potential for using electricity expertise to help Peabody Coal expand in this area in the United States could also help Energy's growth.</p>
<p>"Peabody could be the most interesting. It's a clear chance to expand into electricity in the U.S.," one analyst said.</p>
<p>There has been some speculation Peabody Coal could be spun off from the British electricity interests, but on Friday Hanson chairman Lord Hanson ruled this out.</p>
<p>"No, I have had enough of demergers and I think (the two) fit very well together," he replied to a shareholder question.</p>
<p>Energy has already said it is mulling a string of acquisitions in Britain and North America and has started talks with a U.S. power marketing company.</p>
<p>"Energy will be substantially cash generative until it starts making acquisitions," Campbell said.</p>
<p>Energy said in its official listing prospectus it aimed to become "an integrated energy supplier in the U.S., UK and Australia," with longer-term plans to develop the energy business in other countries.</p>
<p>It also said it wanted to consider "potential investments in U.S. electricity generation."</p>
<p>Campbell said he expected earnings growth of around 12 percent annually over the next two years and dividend growth of around seven percent a year for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Energy's annual turnover in the year to September 30, 1996 was 3.6 billion pounds ($5.8 billion), with pre-exceptional profits of 446 million pounds and total assets of 5.7 billion pounds.</p>
<p>It comes to the market with 1.4 billion pounds of debt.</p>
