<p>Benton Oil and Gas Co. said Thursday its 1996 proved oil reserves rose 14 percent from 1995, with substantial increases coming from its Venezuelan South Monagas oil prospect.</p>
<p>Estimated reserves stood at 109.6 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) as of year-end 1996, the highest in company history, according to a prepared statement issued by Benton.</p>
<p>"We are pleased with Benton's continued reserve growth and production replacement ratio, especially considering that oil and gas production volumes more than doubled during the year," said A. E. Benton, chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Reserves added in 1996 from the company's development activities replaced 198 percent of production, which increased 105 percent over 1995 to 13.7 million BOE.</p>
<p>Benton's Venezuelan reserves rose approximately 17 percent to 86.1 million BOE at year-end 1996 from 73.6 million BOE a year earlier, the company said. Venezuela production rose 131 percent to 34,557 barrels-per-day (bpd) from 14,949 bpd a year earlier.</p>
<p>Production from the South Monagas Unit currently exceeds 42,000 bpd.</p>
<p>In Russia, Benton's 34 percent share of proved reserves in the North Gubkinskoye Field in Western Siberia increased four percent to 23.5 million BOE in 1996, versus 22.6 million BOE in 1995.</p>
<p>The company said reserve gains in West Siberia were modest due to limited drilling activity pending the completion of a $65 million project financing agreement.</p>
<p>"We had a slight, but positive increase from our Russian operations...we expect Russia to be a significant factor in our production and reserve growth beginning in 1997," Benton said.</p>
