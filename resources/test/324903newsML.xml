<p>IMCO Recycling Inc said on Wednesday it has arranged $125 million in senior secured credit facilities, and used some of the funds to complete its purchase of IMSAMET.</p>
<p>The credit facilities include a $105 million term loan and a $20 million revolving credit agreement.</p>
<p>IMCO said it used some term loan funds to complete its previously announced purchase of IMSAMET for $58 million in cash. IMSAMET, which owns or co-owns aluminum recycling plants in Arizona, Idaho and Utah, had been a wholly owned subsidiary of EnviroSource Inc.</p>
<p>Acquiring the IMSAMET plants boosts IMCO's effective annual processing capacity to 2.2 billion pounds, 36 percent higher than it was last year.</p>
<p>IMCO also said it completed its previously announced plan to buy Rock Creek Aluminum Inc for $9.5 million in new IMCO shares.  These transactions leave IMCO with outstanding total debt of $117.4 million, the company said.</p>
