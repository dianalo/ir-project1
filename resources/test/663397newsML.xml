<p>The Philippine peso ended firmer after the Central Bank capped its selling rates between 26.372 and 26.377 to the dollar.</p>
<p>"Everybody just took a cue from the Central Bank rates and moved within that range," a bank trader said.</p>
<p>The peso ended at 26.377 from Friday's 26.381.  </p>
<p>Traders said the Central Bank sold around $27 million at 26.372 pesos and another $3 million at 26.377.</p>
<p>Some banks which were short-selling dollars on Friday bought them from the Central Bank at 26.372 for value today, traders said.</p>
<p>Total volume dropped to $238.7 million from $304 million.</p>
<p>Traders  said they expected the market to continue in its narrow band on Tuesday with a lack of any factors to give fresh direction.</p>
