<p>U.K. motorists continue to benefit from a competitive domestic gasoline market and allegations of predatory pricing are ill founded, regulators and government officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>They testified before a trade and industry committee on recommendations to soften the effect of a nationwide price war that is expected to put 1,500 to 2,000 stations out of business this year.</p>
<p>The Price Watch campaign, launched by Exxon unit Esso earlier this year, is estimated to have cost the company 200 million sterling in pre-tax profits this year, industry analysts said.</p>
<p>Independent retailers view the price cuts as efforts to wipe out the competition and will lead to higher prices, while others see it as free-market economics in a market rife with overcapacity that has kept British prices the lowest in Europe.</p>
<p>The Director General of Fair Trading, John Bridgeman, agreed to meet the Petroleum Retailers Association and sponsor a meeting on arbitrations between wholesalers and retailers.</p>
<p>But he said a code of practice already exists among wholesalers and reiterated that his office had found no evidence that competition was "breaking down."</p>
<p>He said he would not intervene amid allegations of discrimination against independent retailers.</p>
<p>"We find no case for intervention by the authorities," he told a trade and industry committee hearing. He added that any further investigation would be in its 1997 quadrennial review.</p>
<p>Motorists have benefited from the lowest gasoline prices in Europe but profit margins have been squeezed, to as low as one to two pence a litre over the summer.</p>
<p>"Consumers are not complaining," Bridgeman said.</p>
<p>The Minister of Energy, Lord Fraser of Carmyllie, told the committee he would not heed its recommendation to levy the duty on petrol refined in the U.K. as it leaves storage, rather than as it leaves the refinery.</p>
<p>"I don't think the evidence we see can be said yet that it is an uncompetitive market," he said.</p>
<p>Witnesses were called after the committee was unhappy with their responses, mostly rejections, to 11 recommendations issued last summer.</p>
<p>Particularly disturbing was the percentage OFT cited of petrol sold by independent stations. The OFT quoted 10 percent, then amended it to 30 percent, blaming it on a clerical error.</p>
<p>"Our concern was that it was getting superficial in character in each of their responses and it seemed they were sweeping aside our concerns," Martin O'Neill of the opposition Labour party, chairman of the committee, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The committee will be reviewing the recommendations in light of their responses and will comment in early 1997, he said.</p>
<p>The Director General was also questioned as to whether his agency was standing on the sidelines due to lack of resources, since only two people were designated for petrol.</p>
<p>Bruce Petter, director of the Petroleum Retailers Association, which represents independent retailers, welcomed the meeting with the OFT but "deplored" the decision not to change the duty.</p>
<p>"I'm satisfied that we've seen substantial movement from a totally negative position, but overall we're starting from a fairly low base," Petter told Reuters.</p>
<p>Stephen Brooks, principal consultant at Wood Mackenzie, said on Tuesday the Price Watch had cost Esso, a unit of U.S. oil giant Exxon Corp, an estimated 200 million stg, or about one-third of Esso's U.K. pre-tax profits in 1995.</p>
<p>The loss takes into account the drop in gross margins and the increase in Esso's market share to about 20 percent from 17 percent, he said.</p>
<p>Margins were not expected to return to the levels before Price Watch because the OFT and government indicated they will not intervene to protect the independents "from what are viewed as free market competitive forces", he said.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the proposal to develop an arbitration procedure between wholesalers and their dealers could ultimately lead to a more rapid reduction in site numbers than would otherwise be the case," he said.</p>
