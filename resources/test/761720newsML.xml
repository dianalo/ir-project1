<title>AUSTRALIA: Rate cut hopes push Australian stocks up 1.2 pct.</title>
<headline>Rate cut hopes push Australian stocks up 1.2 pct.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-07-28</dateline>

<p>The Australian share market ended 1.2 percent higher on Monday on continuing anticipation of an official interest rate cut, and dealers say the bullish sentiment may see the market surge to record highs.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index ended 32.6 points up at 2,723.8, only 34.1 points from the all-time high of 2757.9 set on July 8.</p>
<p>"There's been strength more or less across the board today," said Andrew Sekely, head of equities at Intersuisse Ltd in Sydney.</p>
<p>Dealers said investors seemed confident the Reserve Bank of Australia would cut the official rate from the current 5.50 percent after its next board meeting on August 5.</p>
<p>"We didn't get it last week, but that doesn't mean we're not going to get it at all and consequently the industrials are forging ahead," Sekely said.</p>
<p>A relatively weak dollar and firmer metal prices overnight supported the big mining companies, with The Broken Hill Pty Co finishing 33 cents higher at A$18.33 (US$13.38) and WMC 13 cents up at A$7.87.</p>
<p>But the topic of the day was the banking sector.</p>
<p>Westpac leapt 27 cents to A$8.50 in active trade, off a record high A$8.55 earlier in the day, following Friday's clearance by authorities of its bid for Bank of Melbourne.</p>
<p>"The bank had declared themselves as very exposed if they didn't get it and it was marked down a bit for that. Now it has come through, the shares have kicked back up again," Macquarie Equities banking analyst Graham Maloney said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the deal had fuelled hard-wearing, but so far apparently unfounded, speculation on other bank takeovers.</p>
<p>St George Bank, Australia's fifth largest bank and one of the speculation targets, jumped 23 cents to A$8.76.</p>
<p>National Australia Bank (NAB) more than recovered from a slide on Thursday when it presented lower than expected third quarter results. The bank closed 45 cents up at A$19.73.</p>
<p>Commonwealth Bank failed to keep up with the other big banks, and ended only 1.4 cents higher at A$16.484.</p>
<p>"There is a result coming out shortly and some people may be getting cold feet," one Sydney-based dealer said, adding NAB's weak result from domestic operations could have triggered woes about Commonwealth Bank's performance on the local market.</p>
<p>Higher gold bullion prices helped the long-suffering mining sector recover 2.1 percent, with Normandy Mining stepping seven cents higher to A$1.55 in active trade.</p>
<p>One of the day's best performing stocks was Lend Lease with an 80 cent increase to an even A$30. One senior dealer said some major brokers had upgraded their earnings forecasts for the property and financial services group, and that this had made new investors come forward.</p>
<p>Oil Search jumped to new highs, rising 30 cents to A$4.17.</p>
<p>"The oil sector is looking quite strong, gaining a lot of confidence both from domestic money and from overseas funds," one Brisbane-based dealer said, adding Oil Search was also expected to have increased its oil reserves.</p>
<p>(A$1 = US$0.73)</p>
