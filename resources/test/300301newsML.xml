<p>Austrian Finance Minister Viktor Klima said on Friday he expected to reach a decision on who buys the state's 70 percent voting stake in flagship bank Creditanstalt before Tuesday, domestic news agency APA said.</p>
<p>"At present, Klima is convinced he will be able to make a decision on the sale before the special session of parliament (Tuesday, January 14)," APA said, quoting an interview with the minister.  </p>
<p>Klima stressed the weekend would be taken up by an assessment of the existing three bids for the bank by his advisors and lawyers. A final deadline for bidders to adjust their offer expired at 0800 GMT on Friday.</p>
<p>Minutes before, market leader Bank Austria, considered to be the leading bidder, said it had increased its existing 16.8 billion schillings ($1.5 billion) offer for the state's 19.9 million voting shares in Creditanstalt, but gave no details.</p>
<p>A rival consortium led by insurer EA-Generali has also increased its original 13.8 billion schillings bid for the stake, but declined to say by how much.</p>
<p>The conservative People's Party, junior coalition partner of the dominant Social Democrats, called for the special parliament meeting to debate the hotly contested privatisation which has deeply divided the fragile coalition government.</p>
<p>Leaders of the coalition will meet on Saturday afternoon to try and iron out their differences.</p>
