<p>The Agriculture Department surprised commodity traders Tuesday by predicting more stocks of soybeans in the United States than anticipated and less exports.</p>
<p>Soybean futures prices fell sharply after the government released estimates that soybean stocks by this fall will total 140 million bushels, a record low level but unchanged from last month's estimate.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Board of Trade, May soybeans fell 4-1/2 cents to $8.55-1/2 a bushel after earlier falling as low $8.45. On Monday, May soybean rose 30 cents to $8.60 -- the highest closing price in 8-1/2 years.</p>
<p>A senior government analyst said plentiful soybean supplies from South America, coupled with high U.S. prices, will cut significantly into American soybean exports over the next several months and help maintain U.S. stock levels.</p>
<p>"The big thing is the increase in the South American crop," said Jim Matthews, senior oilseeds analyst on the Agriculture Department's World Agricultural Outlook Board which formulates the government statistics.</p>
<p>"That crop will start coming to the market in a more substantial way in late March and April," Matthews said in an interview. "If we didn't have a huge stockpile of soybeans in South America, we would go higher with exports and stocks would be lower."</p>
<p>Commodity traders had expected the agency to lower its stocks estimate by 10 million to 15 million bushels, and soybean contracts Monday rose sharply in anticipation of the tighter estimates. But after the report was released Tuesday morning, prices dropped as traders regrouped.</p>
<p>"Obviously the unchanged number (soybean stocks) was bearish. They were expecting a 10 (million) to 20 million bushel reduction and got nothing," said a Chicago trader.</p>
<p>The government said U.S. soybean exports, which have been running more than 20 percent over year-ago levels, would total 900 million bushels this marketing year, which began last September. That projection is above last year's exports of 851 million but slightly under February's estimate of 905 million.</p>
<p>Government analyst Matthews said exports may go even lower if U.S. prices stay high, South American exports remain brisk, and demand in Europe and elsewhere for U.S. beans dries up.</p>
<p>Matthews said the European Union, the biggest soybean importer in the world, already has reduced its use of imported U.S. soy products in reaction to high prices. Matthews said global demand for U.S. soybeans will only go lower as customers shift to the cheaper South American supplies.</p>
<p>"We're looking at a near record drop in (total) U.S. soybean exports in the last half of the year -- certainly one of the biggest drops we've ever had," he said.</p>
<p>Brazil and Argentina are predicted to harvest record soybean crops this year. Matthews and his team upped their projections for Brazilian soybean production this month to 27 million metric tons, up from last month's 26.5 million, adding to the bearish sentiment in comodity trading pits.</p>
<p>"We put 30 cents premium in the market yesterday and with the Brazilian crop at 27 million, it justifies taking the premium out," said Don Roose of US Commodities.</p>
