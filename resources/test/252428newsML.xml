<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures turned mixed late Thursday in moderate trade, with January paring early losses on bearish AGA data and edging higher on forecasts for colder weather next week, sources said.</p>
<p>At 1430 EST, January was 0.7 cent higher at $3.51 per million British thermal units, while February was down 0.9 cent at $3.23. Other deferreds were narrowly mixed.</p>
<p>"If we can't fall with this (mild) weather, what's going to happen when we get a real cold front," said one East Coast trader, noting forecasts next week called for some below-normal weather, particularly in the Midwest.  </p>
<p>AGA said Wednesday U.S. gas stocks fell last week by 72 bcf to 75 percent of capacity, well-below expectations in the 84-92 bcf range. Stocks were still 214 bcf, or eight percent, below year-ago levels.</p>
<p>The six- to 10-day outlook is calling for temperatures throughout most of the U.S, excluding the East Coast, to be below- to much below-normal.</p>
<p>Prices rallied early on news that one of three 30-inch TransCanada lines ruptured late Wednesday in western Ontario, but slid later when the company said no deliveries were affected because it was able to re-route gas along an adjacent pipeline.</p>
<p>Technical traders still pegged support in January in the $3.19 area, then $3.11 and $3.04. Resistance was seen in the mid-$3.50s and then at $3.70. Major resistance was pegged at the contract high of $3.80.</p>
<p>In the cash market, Gulf Coast prices were talked down slightly Thursday at about the $3.40 level. Midcontinent pipes also were slightly lower in the low-$3.30s. New York city gate gas was talked a couple of cents lower at about $4.00.</p>
<p>NYMEX said 24,712 contracts traded at 1400 EST. Hub open interest on Dec 11 rose 1,419 contracts to 149,232.</p>
<p>NYMEX Alberta and Permian natgas futures were untraded at 1430 EST. Alberta open interest on Dec 11 fell 10 lots to 239. Permian open interest was unchanged at 89.</p>
<p>Permian cash prices on Wednesday were around $3.25.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, January firmed 1.5 cents to $3.36, while deferreds were steady to three cents lower. The East/West spread widened by 0.2 cent to 15.0 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
