<p>Finnish hardware retailer and wholesaler Starckjohann Oy said in a statement on Thursday it had sold its entire majority stake in wood machinery wholesaler Penope Oy to Kontram-Yhtiot Oy's managing director Arto Jokinen.</p>
<p>It did not give the price of the deal, but said it would not have any significant earnings impact.  </p>
<p>Starckjohann had owned 58.1 percent of shares and 50.5 percent of votes in Penope, its holding made up of 235,600 K-shares and 188,254 A-shares.</p>
<p>In April, Starckjohann had raised its stake in Penope to 58 percent when it bought 38,000 K-shares from Penope's managing director Jarmo Kivisto.</p>
<p>In a separate statement on the deal, Penope said its four K-shareholders, including Jokinen and Kivisto, had made an agreement to combine the company's K- and A-shares into a single share series, which would be quoted on the OTC-list.</p>
<p>Penope would also launch a rights issue to shareholders, employees, institutional investors and the public.</p>
