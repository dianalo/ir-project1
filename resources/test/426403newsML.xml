<p>The U.S. envoy to Colombia insisted in an interview published on Friday that two powerful drug lords offered to provide him with damaging evidence linking President Ernesto Samper to the narcotics trade.</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador Myles Frechette, who spoke of the alleged offer for the first time in a television interview on Wednesday, pressed his case in Friday's editions of El Espectador newspaper. He said brothers Gilberto and Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela, jailed leaders of the Cali drug cartel, offered evidence against Samper in exchange for lenient treatment by U.S. judicial officials.</p>
<p>Samper was acquitted by Colombia's Congress last June of charges he received millions of dollars in drug cartel money to finance his 1994 election campaign. But the ruling by a Congress dominated by Samper's own Liberal Party was dismissed as a whitewash by opposition politicians and senior U.S. officials.</p>
<p>"The Rodriguez Orejuelas have sent letters to me, they've sent messages through William Rodriguez Abadia," Frechette told El Espectador, referring to a son of Miguel Rodriguez. He said the billionaire kingpins believed at one time to control 80 percent of the world's cocaine trade offered to tell "all their secrets" as part of a deal under which the United States would stop insisting on their extradition.</p>
<p>"From time to time the Rodriguez Orejuelas have said 'OK, we'll give you all the proof about Samper,'" Frechette added, referring to alleged evidence showing the Colombian leader knowingly received cocaine cash to finance his campaign.</p>
<p>Frechette said he had rejected all offers to negotiate with the Rodriguez brothers, adding that the United States had no interest in pursuing criminal charges against Samper.</p>
<p>"It is not North American policy to topple Samper," he said. "Every time the Rodriguezes have approached me, through letters or an intermediary, I have informed the prosecutor-general."</p>
<p>Prosecutor-General Alfonso Valdivieso, an anti-drug crusader who filed the charges that led to Samper's impeachment trial in Congress, could not be reached for immediate comment. But El Espectador quoted him as saying Frechette had alluded to the brothers' willingness to testify against Samper 1-1/2 years ago but never elaborated on it.</p>
<p>The newspaper also said the Rodriguez brothers, who have been jailed since 1995, denied in statements made through their lawyers that they had ever offered to testify against Samper.</p>
<p>Samper's lawyer, Luis Guillermo Nieto Roa, accused Frechette on Thursday of lying about the Rodriguezes, who U.S. officials say continue to run their criminal empire from behind the walls of Bogota's La Picota prison.</p>
<p>"If the Rodriguez brothers offered proof, it's a lie to say the American government would have rejected them," he said. "Washington is resorting to the most vile instruments, including lies, to achieve its objective of ousting the head of state."</p>
