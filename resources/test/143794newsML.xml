<p>Acting Miami City Manager Merrett Stierheim has agreed to extend his stay on the job to November 15, city officials said Friday.</p>
<p>Stierheim, a former Dade County manager who heads the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, had previously agreed to act as interim city manager until October 30.</p>
<p>Mayor Joe Carollo asked him to stay on because the city commission is still searching for a permanent city manager.</p>
<p>Stierheim replaced City Manager Cesar Odio, who resigned in September after federal prosecutors charged him with allegedly soliciting kickbacks in connection with city contracts.</p>
<p>Stierheim and a team of corporate and public finance volunteers are helping the city draft a plan to close a $68 million deficit in its $275 million budget for the year that began Oct 1.</p>
