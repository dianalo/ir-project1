<p>Harris Corp on Thursday denied any liability in a U.S. patent lawsuit and said if necessary it would appeal a federal district court jury decision awarding $7.7 million in damages to Comark Communications Inc.</p>
<p>The jury decision pertains to an audio correction circuit used in a model of Harris analog television transmitters, which the jury said infringed on a 1993 patent issued by Comark.</p>
<p>Harris said it obtained a patent in 1995 for its own version of the circuit and subsequently developed a new circuit to replace the older technology in its analog transmitters.</p>
<p>"We strongly deny any liability and believe that our technology did not infringe the patent," said Harris vice president and general counsel Richard Ballantyne. "We plan to aggressively seek to have the jury decision set aside and, if necessary, appeal the ruling to the federal circuit court of appeals."</p>
<p>Harris Corp supplies television transmitters in the United States.  Comark Communications provides digital television equipment.</p>
