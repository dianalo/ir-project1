<p>U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry said on Friday he will meet Russian Defence Minister Igor Rodionov twice before the end of the year as part of efforts to convince Moscow that NATO enlargement is not a threat to Russia.</p>
<p>"We will get to work together and you will see that NATO is not a threat. Tell that story to the Russian people," Perry said he told Rodionov on Thursday at the end of an informal, two-day meeting of NATO defence ministers in Bergen.</p>
<p>Perry described to reporters his first formal meeting with the Russian defence chief, who replaced sacked defence minister Pavel Grachev in July, as a good one but much too short.</p>
<p>"I will be following up by meeting with him in Moscow next month, and he will be coming to the United States for a meeting in December," said Perry, who will testify to the Russian Duma in late October on behalf of the pending START-2 strategic arms reduction treaty.</p>
<p>"We have time set aside for very intensive substantive discussions, but the meetings yesterday were a very good beginning," said Perry.</p>
<p>Rodionov, who met with the 16 defence ministers of NATO at a special session and also held private talks with Perry, voiced continuing opposition by Moscow to NATO's plans to expand into former communist states of eastern Europe next year.</p>
<p>While promising continued Russian military cooperation with NATO in Bosnia and in other areas, he said that the Russian people simply did not believe that enlargement by the alliance was not a threat to Russia as Perry and others have said.</p>
<p>NATO sources said Perry offered to open the alliance's doors to Moscow in a move which would stop just short of full membership and radically alter the European security architecture of the last 50 years.</p>
<p>NATO hopes a new deal with Russia will result in Moscow dropping its objections to alliance membership for Russia's old allies from the now-defunct Warsaw Pact.</p>
<p>Since the end of the Cold War, ex-Communist countries have been seeking to join NATO to guarantee their future security against Russia. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are the most likely candidates, but could be joined by Slovenia.</p>
<p>The NATO meeting reaffirmed plans to go ahead with enlargement, but Perry refused to discuss which countries may be invited next year to accession talks.</p>
<p>Asked specifically about the chances of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, however, he said: "I think they are not yet ready for membership but the emphasis is on "not yet'."</p>
<p>"A key feature of the military alliance is the ability to come to the defence of all other members of the alliance if they come under attack," Perry said.</p>
<p>"Therefore each nation in the alliance has to have military forces that have some minimum capability and some degree of compatability with NATO forces. In my judgment the Baltic nations do not have that kind of capability yet but they are working very hard to get it," he said.</p>
<p>He said Western countries continued to work with the Baltic nations in Partnership for Peace -- a military cooperation with NATO -- to improve their readiness for membership.</p>
<p>Robert Hunter, U.S. ambassador to NATO, said: "We first want to make sure that they can be part of later enlargement, but secondly we are going to broaden, deepen, strengthen Partnership for Peace and other things so that there will be no sense of being pushed away."</p>
