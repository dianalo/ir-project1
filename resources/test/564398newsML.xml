<p>About 12.5 million Internet surfers have accessed Queen Elizabeth's website since the British monarch took to the information superhighway two months ago, Buckingham Palace said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Her 165-page world of crowns, corgis and castles attracted one million hits on the opening day and the site is now being expanded with another 85 pages to sate the appetite of enthusiasts.</p>
<p>"Hopefully it is demonstrating we are pitching it at the right level and covering the subjects people are interested in," a palace spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>"We see this as a very encouraging start to the website. But we are not going to be complacent. We will keep updating. Like all websites, they have to be weeded and upgraded to encourage return."</p>
<p>The new website pages of royal history are illustrated with 30 paintings, photos and hitherto unseen prints from the royal collection, she said.</p>
<p>Queen Elizabeth launched the website on March 6 with a wealth of information about today's monarchy, how it works, its members, its many palaces and the huge royal art collection.</p>
<p>A page listing the members of today's royal family includes Diana, Princess of Wales, divorced last year from heir to the throne Prince Charles. But Sarah, Duchess of York, who divorced the Queen's second son Andrew, is not on show.</p>
<p>The website has also been updated since Conservative Prime Minister John Major was unseated last week in a landslide election victory by Labour leader Tony Blair.</p>
<p>A photo caption of the queen with Major refers to him as former prime minister.</p>
<p>Since the launch, 50,000 people have recorded their electronic comments in the website "visitors book".</p>
<p>"There is a very high interest from America which would of course reflect pc (personal computer) ownership. There is a very wide spread internationally, from Iceland to Japan to Brazil," the palace spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>"The vast majority take the opportunity to make their views known on the monarchy. The vast majority are supportive, which is a morale booster," she said.</p>
<p>The 1,000-year-old British monarchy's popularity has been dented by the highly publicised marital splits of the young royals.</p>
<p>Accessing the history of the British crown costs the price of a local telephone call. The website address is http://www.royal.gov.uk.</p>
