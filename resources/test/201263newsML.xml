<p>French President Jacques Chirac said on Tuesday that Paris still believed a multinational force was needed to help out with the refugee crisis in Zaire, even though many of the refugees were returning home to Rwanda.</p>
<p>Chirac, who is visiting Japan, told a news conference the force was still needed to protect airfields and food convoys.  </p>
<p>Military officials from Canada, the United States, France and about a dozen other nations will meet in Germany on Thursday to reassess the rapidly changing need for a humanitarian relief force in Zaire, including possibly changing its mission or scaling back the force.</p>
<p>Asked whether France had any thought of modifying its position now that refugees were leaving, Chirac replied: "The French policy in the region has two objectives... These objectives have not changed.</p>
<p>"So no, the situation in the area has not changed. It (a multinational force) is necessary for the security of the airfields and food convoys."</p>
