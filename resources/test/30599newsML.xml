<headline>INTERVIEW - IMI still looking for acquisitions.</headline>

<p>IMI Plc finance director Alan Emson said on Tuesday the engineering group is still looking for acquisitions after buying Heimeier, Germany's largest manufacturer of thermostatic radiotor valves, earlier this year.</p>
<p>Heimeier's contribution was one the main motor's behind IMI record first half profit of 67.2 million stg, up from 49.0 million a year ago. The 1996 first-half figure is excluding an exceptional gain of 70.8 million on the disposal of assets.</p>
<p>Profits were also boosted by the absence of the loss-making titanium investments, sold in June, finance director Alan Emson told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Emson declined to say in which areas IMI was looking to make acquisitions, but he did say that IMI had the financial muscle to buy without tapping capital markets.</p>
<p>"We can buy straight out of our borrowings capacity," he said. "It would take a very long time and a very big buy before we would have to tap the market," he added.</p>
<p>IMI's gearing was a mere nine percent by June, 30, compared with 24 percent a year earlier. Emson said that any new purchases would be within IMI's core areas: building products, drink dispense, fluid power and special engineering.  </p>
<p>He added that IMI was also looking for organic growth, pointing to increased investments in marketing activities and new production facilities in developing countries such as China and Malaysia. Capital expenditure in the first half of 1996 rose to 30 million stg from 24 million a year ago.</p>
<p>IMI might dispose of some more activities following the titanium sale, but any new divestments would be on a smaller scale, Emson said. "You have seen the major ones," he said.</p>
<p>In 1996's first half, operating profit in the building products sector rose to 23.7 million stg from 16.9 million. Heimeier contributed 8.1 million stg.  </p>
<p>Profits in drink dispense were 19.6 million stg, which was 0.6 million more than a year ago.</p>
<p>Fluid power's profit rose 16.3 million from 15.1 million, while there was an increase in special engineering to 8.5 million from 7.6 million stg.</p>
<p>Emson said IMI was cautiously optimistic about the second half of this year, saying that IMI's order books were looking stronger and pointing to optimistic macro-economic forecasts.</p>
<p>"But on the basis of short-term evidence, there is no reason yet for us to sit here with our hands on our heart to say it is all happening now," he said.</p>
