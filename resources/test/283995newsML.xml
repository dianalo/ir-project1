<headline>CME lumber ends up sharply to limit on rising cash.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-01-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Reports of further advances in cash lumber prices kept CME lumber futures sharply higher to limit up at the close with all but distant November posting new contract highs.</p>
<p>Futures ended $18.80 to $4.00 per thousand board feet higher with limitless January up most at $443.50 per tbf after setting a new high of $450.50 during the day. March finished up the $10.00 limit at a new high of $427.30 per tbf.</p>
<p>Futures rallied after falling from initial gains on profit taking following the break in financials. Cash sources said spruce prices were rising.</p>
<p>"Some (buyers) are coming back to the market that have been out of the market for two or three weeks," said Neil Schmaedick, Smith Barney Forest Products analyst.</p>
<p>Cash sources said there were mills asking as high as $422 for spruce. This was well above the last official quote of $392 for spruce last Friday. Wholesalers and dealers were short of lumber while production was still minimal due to the holidays and poor weather in the Northwest, they said.</p>
<p>In lumber options, March traded synthetically $2.00 to $3.00 higher on spreads, pit sources added.</p>
