<p>Japan's planned "Big Bang" financial reforms will quicken the pace of sales of shares held in cross-shareholding between Japanese companies, a senior analyst said on Friday.</p>
<p>Already about two trillion to three trillion yen worth of such shares are sold off each year, and the financial reforms will increase that, said Makoto Takano, a senior analyst at Daiwa Institute of Research.</p>
<p>"Ahead of the planned Big Bang, the selling of stakes financial institutions hold in each other, or stakes held by firms, is bound to increase," Takano said in an interview.</p>
<p>Japan's traditional cross-shareholding -- a practice by which companies hold each others' shares to strengthen business ties -- has lost some lustre, especially among financial firms in the face of the planned financial deregulation.</p>
<p>Japan announced a five-year Big Bang plan last November to liberalise its financial markets and try to catch up with reforms carried out more than a decade ago in Europe and North America.</p>
<p>Once the deregulation is carried out, financial firms such as banks will be able to enter other financial sectors, such as securities, through financial holding companies as opposed to subsidiaries, Takano said.  </p>
<p>With barriers between the sectors removed, the merit of holding each other's shares will decrease.</p>
<p>"As direct financing increases, firms will eliminate their financial institution shares, which are of little benefit to them," Takano said. "As for city banks, cross shareholdings will have no meaning for them and they may completely sell off what they have."</p>
<p>At present, cross-shareholdings between Japanese firms, including financial firms, total 120 trillion yen. Of that, Takano said up to 30 trillion yen worth was likely to be sold.</p>
<p>The selling may send the market's supply and demand balance awry, but it will not be done in such a way that the share price will be hurt, he said.</p>
<p>"But in the case of financial sector issues, which are desperately unwanted, the seller may opt to dump them, which would drive down the share price," he said. -- Koichi Kawaguchi, Tokyo Equities Desk +81-3-3432-6308</p>
