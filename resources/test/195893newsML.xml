<headline>FOCUS - Euro investors pounce on Telekom issue.</headline>

<p>Investors enthusiastically welcomed Europe's biggest share flotation on Monday, competing furiously for the chance to pay a healthy premium to secure Deutsche Telekom shares.</p>
<p>The 20 billion mark ($13.3 billion) issue failed to ignite the overall German stock market, however, and by dominating investor interest it helped depress thin trading.</p>
<p>Among Europe's other major bourses, Paris also sagged as market players took profits after last week's gains, while the London market eked out a small rise.</p>
<p>Wall Street opened a trace higher after last week's record-breaking run, with firm Treasury Bonds lending a positive tone. The Dow Industrials was up nearly six points at 1525 GMT.</p>
<p>On foreign exchange markets, the dollar was steady at the top of its day's range against the yen, but with few fresh factors to move the market, afternoon trade in Europe was subdued.</p>
<p>Nearly 38 million shares had changed hands by the time the German stock market ended floor trade, with the stock trading up to a high of 34.10 -- well above the 28.50 marks the issue was priced at on Sunday.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom, Europe's biggest telecommunications firm, painted Frankfurt pink to mark the climax of its long-awaited share issue, blazoning chandeliers, baseball caps and even the walls of the Frankfurt stock exchange with its corporate colour.</p>
<p>With the public issue oversubscribed at least five times over, investors who missed out on securing the shares they wanted were forced to buy on the market.</p>
<p>Despite the enthusiasm, however, Germany's 30-share DAX share index ended 31 points, or 1.14 percent down, at 2,763.84. In later computerised trade, the IBIS DAX was at 2,773.28.</p>
<p>"There's only one subject today and that's Telekom. Don't go looking for much action elsewhere in the market," said one Frankfurt trader.</p>
<p>Telekom stock by 1530 GMT had slipped to 32.80 in IBIS trading.</p>
<p>London's share market gyrated around its opening levels, managing to rise around five points by 1515 GMT as traders waited to see if Wall Street could sustain its run.</p>
<p>"The problem is, we've been waiting and waiting for it to fall and people are just getting more nervous the higher it gets. We're going nowhere until it falls," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Traders said the British market was likely to mark time ahead of Wednesday's retail sales data amid nagging worries about inflationary pressures and possible interest rate rises.</p>
<p>British Gas led volumes and counted among the strongest net gainers, rising 16 pence to 225, after press reports said Anglo-Dutch Shell had approached British Gas with plans for a 40 billion pound ($67 billion) merger. The reports said the plans had fallen through and neither firm would comment.</p>
<p>French shares cut their losses after the blue-chip CAC-40 index hit a low of 2,224.17, a level which halted the profit-taking that had pulled shares back from Friday's highs. By 1530 GMT, however, the bourse was 11 points adrift.</p>
<p>The dollar was boosted against the yen by news that Japan's October trade surplus with the U.S. had risen 31.3 percent as Japanese car makers took advantage of the weak yen to export more vehicles. Japan's overall trade surplus fell 12.9 percent in October from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Sterling was also firmly in the limelight after data showed Britain's October net public sector debt repayment was well above forecasts.</p>
<p>The pound briefly hit a fresh high of 1.6717 dollars and was trading by 1525 GMT at 1.6703 against 1.6646 in late Europe on Friday.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1525 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 111.42 yen and 1.5034 marks, compared with 111.12 yen and 1.5076 marks in late European trade on Friday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1525 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was up 5.9 points at 3,964.1.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 share index was down 12 points at 2,228.33.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index closed floor trade down 31.96 points at 2,763.84. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index was at 2,778.77.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed slightly lower at $379.10 against $379.70 in the morning. Silver was up five cents at $4.90. ($1=.5994 Pound)</p>
