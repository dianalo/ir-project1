<p>Regulators Thursday set aside a piece of airwave to allow schools, companies, hospitals and others to send computer data, video and voice over their own high-speed local wireless networks.</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission plan will also allow schools and others to gain high-speed access to the Internet over the radio spectrum.</p>
<p>Use of the 300 MHz of spectrum would not require a license.  </p>
<p>Users could cram more information over their own wireless network than over traditional phone line. Schools, for example, could set up wireless computer networks between classrooms, providing access to the Internet without the need of costly construction to lay traditional phone lines.</p>
<p>Unlicensed wireless networks also could improve medical care by allowing hospital staffers to get on-the-spot patient data, X-rays and medical charts.</p>
<p>The commission established a variety of power limits for the bands being used. Wireless networks operating over the lower spectrum band, for example, will be restricted to indoor use.</p>
<p>Users of the higher spectrum bands will be able to communicate over several kilometers.</p>
