<p>Dutch cooperative bank Rabobank said on Friday it could undertake a joint venture with Belgian banks Kredietbank and CERA but it ruled out a merger with them.</p>
<p>"There will never be a merger...., but... activities we could jointly undertake could be put in a joint entity," Rabobank spokesman Jan Dos told Reuters.</p>
<p>Belgian newspapers on Friday quoted Rabobank chairman Herman Wijffels as telling Thursday's annual meeting that the co-operative bank was in talks with Kredietbank (KB) and CERA.  </p>
<p>Rabobank said last month it had been holding talks with KB over the last year about the unification of European markets, the single European currency and globalisation of world financial markets, but denied they planned an alliance.</p>
<p>Dos said on Friday activities in which the banks could cooperate included private banking and investment banking.</p>
<p>He added that talks were at an early stage.</p>
<p>"These are investigative talks only. There have been no decisions by us or others," Dos said.</p>
<p>CERA and Rabobank are members of a Europe-wide body of cooperative banks.</p>
