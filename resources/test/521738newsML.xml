<p>Germany wanted to block the European Union's decision to halt its weekly tender for soft wheat exports on Thursday, while several other states abstained, European grain officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The proposal, however, went through with a comfortable majority at closed weekly grain talks, with only Germany's 10 votes counting against, out of a total ballot of 87 votes.</p>
<p>Under the EU's weighted voting system, countries trying to block a Commission proposal need to muster 26 votes.</p>
<p>Germany's opposition was generally expected given its traditional policy of promoting high grain prices for its mainly small-scale farm sector.</p>
<p>Exports tend to support high domestic prices, whereas the European Commission has focused attention on driving them down after boosting its core wheat sales by 70 percent this year.</p>
<p>Less usual, however, was France's decision to abstain rather than vote against the decision, analysts said.</p>
<p>France nearly always lobbies hard for exports but its grain industry leaders have spoken recently of the need to calm domestic prices, driven up in part by fears over dry weather.</p>
<p>France appears satisified with the way the July/June campaign is being wrapped up, especially after the European Commission awarded more than 400,000 tonnes of wheat through an alternative daily export system this week.</p>
<p>Together with approvals for about the same quantity of flour, the European Commission has released more than one million tonnes of wheat equivalent in the past five days.</p>
<p>All EU states, however, agreed to reject the last batch of wheat export bids at Thursday's weekly export tender.</p>
<p>Tenders for other grains remain open until the end of May.</p>
