<p>The Australian/U.S. 10-year bond yield spread blew out to 100 basis points following today's release of a stronger than expected employment data for January, but this again proved a buying opportunity.</p>
<p>However, spreads to the dollar bloc generally ended wider on the day, particularly at the short-end, as the jobs data put another dent in any remaining speculation of a further easing domestic monetary policy.</p>
<p>The dashed hopes of a rate cut also saw the yield curve flatten once again with the three/10-year bond futures spread falling to around 76 basis points at one stage, its lowest level since the December 11 official interest rate cut to 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>This margin exceeded 100 basis points at the end of last month when rate cut speculation was at its peak.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries were generally flat, although sentiment was mildly bearish following a weak response to Wednesday's 10-year note auction and ahead of the US$10.0 billion 30-year bond sale later today, the last leg of the quarterly refunding.</p>
