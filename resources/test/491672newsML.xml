<p>Sterling rallied against the mark on Monday, rising above its old floor of 2.7780 marks in the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) for the first time since Britain abandoned the system in September 1992.</p>
<p>Sterling has risen more than 22 percent against the mark since last August as a robust British economy has pointed to higher interest rates while German rates have fallen as the country's economy struggled.</p>
<p>The pound took advantage on Monday of a renewed bout of dollar strength against the mark, which suffered across the board from fresh optimism about a timely start to European monetary union.</p>
<p>"The sterling move today has been almost entirely driven by the dollar, with the market bulled up once again about attractive yields in the U.S. and the net effects of EMU," said Peter Von Maydell, senior currency economist at UBS Ltd.</p>
<p>Sterling losses against the dollar during the session illustrated the degree to which the U.S. currency was the catalyst for the day's move.</p>
<p>Sterling tends to track the dollar against other European currencies because the British economic and interest rate cycle is much closer to that in the United States than it is to its European neighbours, analysts said.</p>
<p>Traders, however, said sterling gains were aided by a Sunday newspaper report highlighting the fact that British economic data was understating activity, which may necessitate steeper interest rate rises than currently expected.</p>
<p>"The fundamental economic and interest rate story behind the higher dollar is still in place and that goes for the pound too," said Peter Wood, currency trader at Bank of Boston.</p>
<p>"Obviously we won't get any rate rises here before the (May 1) election but the market will be betting on one very shortly after when (Bank of England governor Eddie) George holds his first meeting with Gordon Brown."</p>
<p>If the opposition Labour Party defeated the Conservatives in the general election, its finance spokesman Gordon Brown would replace Kenneth Clarke as Chancellor of the Exchequer.</p>
<p>At 1620 GMT, the pound was trading at 2.7816 marks, up nearly three pfennigs from 2.7538 on Friday. Against the dollar, the pound was at $1.6287 compared with $1.6375 late on Friday.</p>
<p>The election has sidelined some major players in sterling but has failed to put a serious dent in the pound's trading performance, traders said.</p>
<p>A television debate on Sunday between Clarke and Brown was seen by analysts as showing few differences in policy.</p>
<p>Labour commands an opinion poll lead of more than 20 percentage points over the ruling Conservatives, with the Reuters/NOP poll published on Monday showing the gap at 21 points.</p>
