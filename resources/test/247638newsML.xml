<p>Toll Holdings Ltd said it expects to eventually become a 50 percent shareholder in the private train operations owned by fellow transport group TNT Ltd.</p>
<p>Toll and TNT announced the agreement on Monday, saying the first objective of the consortium will be to expand the size and frequency of TNT's current service on the Melbourne to Perth corridor.</p>
<p>"As the consortium builds a full head of steam we will then look around the full national network," Toll company secretary Bernard McInerney told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>Toll is the largest freight forwarder on Australia's national network, with A$70 million to $80 million in annual business.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Toll announced a 12 month contract with the Australian government-owned National Rail Corp (NRC) for the line haulage of goods from its expanded business.</p>
<p>The contract bundles together the business of the freight fowarding division of Mayne Nickless Ltd which Toll acquired in October last year and Brambles Industries Ltd's general transport and forwarding operation, which Toll acquired in June.</p>
<p>Asked if the agreement with TNT will affect Toll's deal with NRC, McInerney said,"I don't think they'd like it."</p>
<p>"The basic bottom line is that the National Rail even with our agreement is still being uncompetitive in the market place, and we need to protect our market share and protect our clients' interests," he said.</p>
<p>McInerney said the consortium will examine the East-West rail corridor which currently carries two thirds of the three million tonnes of cargo carried annually.</p>
<p>The entry of private companies into Australia's rail freight business follows the government's decision to divest its interests in rail and to establish a framework for a privately operated national rail system.</p>
<p>Apart from TNT, the other private competitor to enter the rail business is privately-held Specialized Container Transport, which like TNT has negotiated access to the standard gauge from Melbourne to Perth.</p>
<p>TNT commenced its Melbourne-Adelaide-Perth service in July and has said it is already exceeding expectations with customers benefiting from improvements in service standards.</p>
<p>TNT is the subject of a friendly A$2 billion takeover bid from Dutch post and telecoms group Koninklijke PTT Nederland NV (KPN). Last Friday KPN said it had gained majority control.</p>
<p>Toll reported a net profit of A$5.4 million in the year to June 30, 1996 on sales of A$234.3 million. The company has forecasted its 1996/97 revenue at A$472.6 million and net profit at A$9.6 million.</p>
