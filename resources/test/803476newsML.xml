<p>British media and leisure group Pearson Plc said on Friday that it has sold its Churchill Livingstone medical publisher to Harcourt General Inc of the U.S. for 92.5 million dollars.  </p>
<p>Chief executive Marjorie Scardino said earlier this month the group was considering offers for Churchill Livingstone as part of its strategy of quitting activities in which it cannot be number one.</p>
<p>Churchill Livingstone was bought by Pearson in the late 1960's and publishes over 1,500 books and CD-ROMs and 70 journals. It had worldwide sales of $47.8 million in 1996 and publishes Gray's Anatomy, required reading for medical students all over the world.</p>
<p>Pearson will receive cash for the sale from U.S. publisher Harcourt.</p>
