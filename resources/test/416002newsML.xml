<p>-- BANK WARNS OF BIG BONUS RISKS</p>
<p>The Bank of England will issue a warning today to City firms of the risk of paying large bonuses. The warning will say the lure of big payouts can encourage traders to take foolhardy risks. The biggest bonuses generally go to company's star performers, who then may feel compelled to justify their status by taking bigger risks to make even bigger profits.</p>
<p>-- FEARS OF STRONG POUND 'DAMAGE'</p>
<p>A warning by  Oxford Economic Forecasting says the strength of sterling will hit manufacturers hard and will probably lead to a sharp slowdown in economic activity by 1998. The economists believe that interest rates will have to rise after the general election to dampen consumer spending and curb inflation. The forecasters argue that the rise in the pound over the past year has worrying implications for the structure of the economy, with the main effect being to dent the performance of manufacturing and to reinforce the reluctance of companies to invest.</p>
<p>-- BT DOUBLES SHARE GIVE-AWAY TO STAFF</p>
<p>British Telecom has decided to raise the percentage of profits it allocates to its share ownership scheme, meaning that nearly 130,000 BT workers will receive more free shares. The BT board has decided to award 2 percent of annual pre-tax profits to the scheme, compared with 1 percent last year.</p>
<p>THE TIMES</p>
<p>-- MERGER WILL BRING 600 JOB LOSSES AT P&amp;O AND STENA</p>
<p>If a planned merger of P&amp;O and Stena ferry fleets goes ahead, more than 600 seafaring jobs could be cut, with the final tally of redundancies being far in excess of the 1,000 forecast by Lord Sterling when the deal was announced last year. Maritime unions are said to be deeply concerned by the redundancy plans, which adds up to around 22 percent of the workforce. Both companies said the redundancies would be voluntary and were only being announced now to comply with employment rules.</p>
<p>-- BBC POISED FOR COMMERCIAL</p>
<p>The BBC will this week launch a family of subscription television channels with an American TV company, entering the commercial arena in earnest. The channels will be owned by a 50-50 joint venture of BBC's commercial arm, BBC Worldwide, and Flextech, the cable and satellite programmer controlled by the largest U.S. cable company, Telecommunications Inc. The BBC will sell programming to the joint venture and share in the income.</p>
<p>-- M&amp;S TO TEST CLOTHING MAIL ORDER IN AUTUMN</p>
<p>Marks &amp; Spencer is set to launch trials of its clothing mail order service in the autumn. The business will be run from its established warehousing and telephone sales facilities in Warrington, and will be run by Marks &amp; Spencer alone and not as a joint venture. The companies charge card database will be used to target customers. The new venture will be the first test by the company, which already controls 16 percent of the British clothing market, of the market for catalogues offering its standard range of clothing.</p>
<p>THE GUARDIAN</p>
<p>-- GUINNESS FLIGHT TO MERGE WITH UNIT TRUST RIVAL</p>
<p>Unit trust specialist Guinness Flight has given up plans to float on the stock market and instead will merge with one of its rivals, Hambros Fund Management. The deal was struck between Guinness Mahon, which owns three-fourths of Guinness Flight, and Hambros merchant bank to create a firm with more than 9 billion pounds stg under its management, with each owning 42.5 percent. -- NATWEST'S 50 MILLION POUNDS INQUEST</p>
<p>Accountants at NatWest were last night examining how and why a senior trader in the banks treasury division entered false information for pricing a series of interest rate options and swaps. Traders at the bank are set for a sharp cut in their annual bonuses, due to be declared soon. The emergence of another rogue trader in the City coincides with the release today of a warning from the Bank of england about high bonus payments to star dealers.</p>
<p>-- LOW WAGES 'BEHIND RISE IN SECOND JOBS'</p>
<p>The Government's jobs record will come under fire today as political opponents and independent academics publish evidence of increasing insecurity and inequality in the workplace despite falling unemployment. Since the last general election in 1992, the number of people who have been forced to find a second job has risen by more than a third, according to an analysis by the Labour Party of the official Labour Force Survey.</p>
<p>THE INDEPENDENT</p>
<p>-- LICENCE REVIEW SET TO NET ITV FIRMS MILLIONS</p>
<p>ITV companies are in preliminary talks with the Independent Television Commission over early renewal of their licenses. If they are successful, they stand to boost their profits by tens of millions of pounds stg each year. The Channel 3 companies are hoping to secure reductions in the levies they give to the Treasury, some by up to half.</p>
<p>-- ABSENTEEISM COSTS INDUSTRY 13 BILLION POUNDS A YEAR</p>
<p>Absenteeism is costing British industry 13 billion pounds stg a year in wasted salary alone, according to the Industrial Society. Low morale, boredom and stress are given as reasons behind the rise in absenteeism. Public sector and voluntary organisations have seen a 25 percent rise in absence rates since the last Industrial Society survey in 1994, suggesting that workers are taking on average one day in 20 as sick leave.</p>
<p>-- ENERGIS MAY LINK WITH CABLE FIRMS TO REACH NEW CUSTOMERS</p>
<p>Energis, the telecommunications business owned by National Grid is looking at radical plans to forge alliances with UK cable companies in hopes of giving the network better access to local business customers. The move is seen as an indication to the long term strategy of Energis after last year's speculation that the Grid was looking to sell a substantial stake in the business, which runs fibre-optic telephone wires along electricity cables.</p>
