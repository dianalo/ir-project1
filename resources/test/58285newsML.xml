<p>----------------------- Sept 17 -------------------------</p>
<p>* Rebounds from day-low of 26.245 pesos</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Philipine peso ended at the same previous close of 26.240 to the dollar on Tuesday after the Central Bank stepped in to cushion the fall of the local currency, traders said.</p>
<p>The peso rebounded from a late morning low of 26.245 after the Central Bank sold close to $100 million at 26.245 pesos.</p>
<p>"More foreign banks covered their (dollar) positions and that caused the buying spree," a trader said.  </p>
<p>But the day's average yielded a weaker peso at 26.244 from 26.238. Volume remained heavy at $159.8 million from $158.8 million.</p>
<p>A foreign bank dealer, however, said "it was the Central Bank itself that caused panic when it raised its offer rate (for the dollar) at the opening of the session to 26.245 from 26.24. Everyone is afraid it may have an agenda. Everyone tends to panic when this happens."</p>
<p>Traders cited the Asian Development Bank report saying that the appreciating peso may have led to the country's wider trade deficit.</p>
