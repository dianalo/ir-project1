<p>Two wireless telecommunications companies, WinStar Communications Inc and Ionica PLC, are braving a potentially unfriendly market environment by attempting to issue zero coupon bonds this week, according to high-yield sources.</p>
<p>WinStar, a competitive local exchange carrier that uses wireless technology, is forging ahead this week with a 144a private placement that includes $250 million in seven- and ten-year deferred interest notes, market sources said.  </p>
<p>The company is also selling $200 million in guaranteed senior secured notes. Credit Suisse First Boston is the lead underwriter.</p>
<p>Also this week, Ionica PLC, a company that provides local and long-distance telecom services to residential and small business customers in the U.K., plans to sell $200 million in ten-year senior discount notes via BT Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Analysts said the results of both offerings could reveal whether the market for zero coupon telecom paper has returned to normal after spreads widened by 50 basis points an average in the sector last week.z  </p>
<p>The sell-off was triggered primarily by investor fears of a glut of new supply from telecom issuers, junk bond sources said. Zero's, which are particularly interest-rate sensitive, were also hurt by the back-up in Treasury rates, they said.</p>
<p>Traders said the tone of the market has improved slightly after Teleport Communications Group and Hyperion Telecommunications pulled their deals last Friday, alleviating some of the concerns about new supply.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, many high-yield players remain wary.  </p>
<p>"This is an industry with a strong outlook, but I strongly believe there comes a time when investors want to step back and reflect on all the debt they are buying for companies which only have nominal revenue," said one buy-side source.</p>
<p>Robert Waldman, head of high-yield research at Salomon Brothers Inc, said such attitudes are reasonable, but added that investors must keep the industry's growing capital needs in perspective.  </p>
<p>"The issue is not that (telecoms) need more money to complete their original plans. It's that their plans are forced to change in order to keep up with the changing regulatory environment," he said.</p>
<p>Price talk on WinStar's deal is 13 3/4 percent to 14 percent on its $100 million seven-year senior deferred interest note tranche and around 14.5 percent for its $150 million ten-year senior subordinated deferred interest note tranche, market sources said.</p>
<p>Price talk on Ionica's $200 million offering of 10-year senior discount notes is 13.5 percent to 14 percent, they said.</p>
<p>Some Wall Street analysts expressed skepticism that the deals could get done at these price talk levels in the current market climate. They speculated either the companies would have to offer higher coupons, add an equity kicker to sweeten the terms for investors, or change the structure.</p>
<p>Officials from both companies as well as Credit Suisse and BT Securities declined to comment.</p>
