<p>The Australian dollar was robbed of a hard won rally to end at three month lows Friday after shockingly weak retail trade data left the market looking down the barrel of a rate cut.</p>
<p>The timing was bitter for bulls who had finally looked to be putting their life together after last week's surprise Reserve Bank easing wiped 1-1/2 cents off the currency.</p>
<p>Now, with local money rates starting to price in another official cut and U.S. policy on a tightening path, dealers reckoned the yawning interest differential was set to suck it down to the 1997 low of US$0.7550, and perhaps beyond.  </p>
<p>By 5.00 pm (0700 GMT) the dollar had fled to US$0.7604/09, its lowest local close since February 12, from an early US$0.7659/64 and US$0.7652/57 late here Thursday.</p>
<p>It briefly flirted with US$0.7680 this morning, its best level for the week, as good sized corporate demand caught the market short and for one moment looked set to fill some of the gap left by last week's tumble from a US$0.7890 peak.</p>
<p>But it all turned ugly when retail sales data showed a 1.7 percent fall in April, confounding expectations of a 0.5 percent rise. The drop came on the back of a 0.3 percent dip in March, the first back-to-back falls since mid-1993.  </p>
<p>Figures on motor vehicle registrations amplified the message of weakness with a 6.0 percent fall in April, way short of the flat result expected.</p>
<p>"The data cast serious doubts on the sustainability of the Q1 recovery in private consumption spending, and hence the speed of the economic recovery through the first half of 1997," said Anthony Thompson, an economist at HSBC Markets.</p>
<p>Debt markets took the hint and drove the 90-day bank bill future, which best mirrors market thinking on official rates, up 15 basis points to 94.63 for the September contract, implying a rate of 5.37 percent against the present 5.50 percent.  </p>
<p>There was better news on Australia's balance of payments with the current account deficit narrowing to A$4.587 billion in the March quarter from A$5.262 billion in Q4.</p>
<p>The improvement came on the trade side where the balance of goods and services posted a A$654 million surplus and net exports promised to make a positive contribution to GDP growth in the quarter of around 0.6 percentage points.</p>
<p>However, any would-be benefit for the dollar was wiped out by the worry of another rate cut and dealers looked for the dollar to test 76 cent support next week enroute to the year low of US$0.7550.  </p>
<p>A breach there would return the currency to levels not seen since February 1996 and would be extremely bearish on a technical view.</p>
<p>On the crosses the currency dipped to 88.62/72 yen from 89.20/30 late Thursday but the damage was limited by a sharp fall in Japanese bond yields following weak industrial production data there Thursday.</p>
<p>The data reassured the market the Bank of Japan would probably not be raising rates soon, even though an LDP committe had recommended the government hike in the future.</p>
<p>In trade weighted terms the dollar dipped to 58.0 from 58.4.  </p>
<p>The outlook for monetary policy should dominate next week as well since the Reserve bank holds its monthly board meeting Tuesday.</p>
<p>Analysts generally doubted the bank would ease again so soon after Friday's 0.5 point cut, but given the market had been surprised by three of the last four cuts, it would still be tense come Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>On Thursday, GDP data will show how the economy fared in the March quarter and are almost certain to show growth slowed sharply in annual terms from the 3.1 percent held in Q4.</p>
