<p>Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd general manager Christopher Langley said on Thursday he expected prices in Hong Kong's luxury property sector to start to plateau, but added the overall market should remain firm.</p>
<p>Langley told reporters that the upper-middle and luxury end of the market had seen some very rapid price increases, leading to the question how long such a rate could be sustained.</p>
<p>"My own personal view is it probably can't be sustained for very much longer, and I would expect to see some of the prices for the luxury properties starting to plateau or perhaps even drop slightly," he said.</p>
<p>"But for the vast majority of the residential property market, we have this fundamental situation of more buyers than sellers," he added.</p>
<p>Given a strong economy, good employment data and good future prospects, Langley said he anticipated that the property market would remain quite firm.</p>
<p>"I think that the market itself is very strongly underpinned," he said.</p>
