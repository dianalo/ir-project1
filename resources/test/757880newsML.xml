<p>A leading member of French Guiana's independence movement has been detained on suspicion of violence against a policeman, a group of supporters in the South American territory said on Friday.</p>
<p>The Solidarity Committee of the Guianese People said that Jean-Victor Castor, who had been detained and freed on arson charges in April, was taken back into custody on Monday.</p>
<p>"Once again France has invented a pretext to break the back of the (Guiana) independence movement," a statement said.</p>
<p>Five French Guianese remain in pre-trial detention suspected of setting fire to the home of the territory's state prosecutor during riots in November 1996 that killed one person and caused millions of dollars of damage, mostly to government buildings.</p>
<p>Their arrests led to a second wave of riots in April in the capital, Cayenne.</p>
<p>The 150,000 population of French Guiana, on the northeast coast of South America, lags behind mainland France in housing, health and education. About a quarter of the workforce is unemployed.</p>
