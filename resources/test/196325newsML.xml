<p>Brazilian soybean plantings were 43 percent complete by Nov 14 against 34 percent by Nov 16, 1995, and an average of the past five years of 36 percent, consultant Safras e Mercado said.  </p>
<p>The pace of plantings has slowed a little given that 29 percent of the crop had been sowed by Nov 7 this year.</p>
<p>This was due to irregular weather which caused problems either of not enough moisture or too much rain in various areas. However the overall outlook remains favorable, Safras said.</p>
<p>Plantings of the 1996/97 crop by Nov 14 per state as estimated by Safras are as follows in percentage terms.  </p>

<p>RIO GRANDE DO SUL - good progress in the past week despite some delays due to rains in producing regions November 10-13 PARANA - another week of much activity reflecting regular rains and adequate soil moisture. Planting almost finished in Cascavel and Maringa regions MATO GROSSO - planting going well with good soil moisture. A little more in the south would be better MATO GROSSO DO SUL - rains in the north and south of the state, with planting in the north delayed a little by the weather GOIAS - saw the most progress after soil moisture levels returned to normal the previous week.  </p>
<p>SAO PAULO - rains at the beginning of the week were important to start again planting in the Sorocabana region. But the Mogiana area is still dry, delaying work slightly. MINAS GERAIS - planting was slowest in the Triangulo area because of irregular rains</p>
