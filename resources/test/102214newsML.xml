<p>Former Georgian defence minister Tengiz Kitovani was sentenced to eight years in prison on Tuesday for organising an illegal armed group and for unlawful possession of weapons.</p>
<p>Kitovani had already been fired by President Eduard Shevardnadze after he led 200 armed men in several buses towards the rebel province of Abkhazia in January 1995. Georgian troops lost control of the province in 1993.</p>
<p>Former Kitovani aides Valery Fisyun and Irakli Suguladze got six years and two years in jail respectively.</p>
<p>The three men were not present in the courtroom, having been banned in an earlier session for shouting obscenities at district judge Ioseb Khurtsidze.</p>
<p>Kitovani, 58, had said his Georgian National Liberation Front, was a legitimate political group with permission to carry firearms. He called the proceedings a show-trial designed by Shevardnadze to get rid of a political opponent.</p>
<p>A giant-canvass artist by trade, he built up a private army of several hundred men and teamed up with another warlord, drama professor Jaba Ioseliani, to stage the bloody overthrow of late President Zviad Gamsakhurdia in January 1992.</p>
<p>Kitovani and Ioseliani then brought Shevardnadze, the last foreign minister of the former Soviet Union, back to power in Georgia. Shevardnadze had ruled the republic as Communist Party chief in the days of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.</p>
