<p>Latvian shares extended recent gains in moderate trade on Monday as low prices and the approaching end of summer lured buyers back to the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Market volume was around 94,000 lats and the bourse index crept up by 0.66 percent to 394.25. The Rietumu index rose 0.69 percent to 153.47.</p>
<p>Three of the four official list shares quoted during the session rose with Unibanka climbing to 3.45 lats from 3.42 lats in trade of 29,000 lats.</p>
<p>Dealers said Unibanka could gain further in coming weeks and help pull up the rest of the market, which has been bearish for much of the summer amid low volumes.</p>
<p>"Unibanka should reach 3.50 lats soon," said one dealer.</p>
<p>Daugavpils Chain was the most active stock in trade of 34,000 lats as it shed one santime to close at 1.06 lats.</p>
