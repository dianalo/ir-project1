<headline>Iraqi Kurd group says agrees new ceasefire.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1996-08-28</dateline>

<p>An Iraqi Kurdish group on Wednesday said it had agreed a new U.S.-brokered ceasefire with a rival faction after a previous accord was shattered by sporadic fighting between the groups in recent days.</p>
<p>"The Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) leadership declares its endorsement for a ceasefire arrangement with the KDP (Kurdistan Democratic Party) to take effect as of 8:00 a.m. on August 28," the PUK said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The PUK said the ceasefire was agreed after talks between U.S. Assistant Secretary for Near East Affairs Robert Pelletreau and PUK leader Jalal Talabani.</p>
<p>The KDP, led by Massoud Barzani, had said a previous ceasefire negotiated by Pelletreau last Friday was broken by the PUK.</p>
<p>Talabani has agreed to take part in talks in London on reaching a comprehensive settlement for the PUK-KDP conflict, the PUK statement said.</p>
<p>It said the KDP was responsible for breaking the previous ceasefire by refusing to endorse it publicly.</p>
