<p>The European Commission on Wednesday proposed strict rules aimed at protecting consumers from mad cow disease, for the transport of sub-standard meat and bone meal between EU member states for destruction.</p>
<p>Infected meat and bone meal fed to animals is beleived to be a major cause of the fatal cattle brain disease, Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), which has destroyed some 168,000 British cattle during the past 10 years.</p>
<p>Since April 1, 1997, meat and bone meal produced for animal feed must respect tough new heat processing standards to eradicate the BSE infectious agent.</p>
<p>Member states which are unable to respect these standards and do not have disposal facilities, may send the meat and bone meal to be burned or used as a fuel in other countries.</p>
<p>British officials said that Britain had adequate facilities.</p>
<p>The Commission proposed that member states must seek prior EU approval of the destination of the meat and bone meal which should be labelled as unfit for animal feed and carried in a sealed container.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal follows a strong warning from the European Parliament to improve food safety and recent EU inspections showing that some member states have not been applying the feed safety standards.</p>
