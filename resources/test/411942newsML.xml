<p>New Zealand shares ended firmer but off their highs on Friday on another day of heavy volume.</p>
<p>The NZSE-40 capital index closed 5.15 points firmer at 2,279.33, with market leader Telecom up four cents at NZ$6.49.</p>
<p>Telecom bought back a further 1.4 million of its own shares at $6.49 and $6.50, and accounted for $41.3 million of the heavy market turnover of $124 million.</p>
<p>Telecom warrants and a line of four million shares at $1.47 in supermarket owner Progressive Enterprises were also substantial contributors to overall turnover.  </p>
<p>Philip Hardie Boys at BZW said it was encouraging that the market was showing good depth, but it remained vulnerable to volatility from offshore.</p>
<p>"You've got U.S. interest rates still tracking up, and that doesn't help equity markets," said Sean Vaughan at County Natwest.</p>
<p>He said next Tuesday's Budget Policy Statement from the government would be watched for indications on where the centre-right coalition would focus its planned extra spending of NZ$5 million over three years, with implications for construction stocks such as Milburn and Fletcher  </p>
<p>Building.</p>
<p>Vaughan expected some consolidation next week in the Fletcher Challenge stocks which, except for Building, all finished lower again in further reaction to this week's poorly-received first half results.</p>
<p>Brierley Investments and Sky City are also due to report half-year results next week.</p>
