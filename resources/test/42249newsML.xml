<p>Sonoco Products Co of the United States has formally inaugurated a paper products joint venture in Shanghai, the Business Weekly said on Sunday.</p>
<p>It said the Sonoco Hongwen Paper Co Ltd, a $45 million venture with Shanghai Hongwen Paper Mill, is 80 percent owned by Sonoco.</p>
<p>The venture has the capacity to produce 65,000 tonnes of kraft linerboard a year.</p>
<p>It quoted Chris Freeman, general manager, as saying that after six months of trial operation, the venture's products were able to compete with imports in a tight domestic market but China's tariff reductions this year had eroded its price advantage.</p>
