<p>Shipping conglomerate Keppel Corp Ltd is proposing to issue up to 350,000 redeemable convertible cumulative preference shares (RCCPS) of US$1.00 each in the capital of the company, a company statement said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Each RCCPS is to be issued at a price of US$1,000, the statement said.</p>
<p>"The purpose of the issue is to raise long term funds at favourable terms. The net proceeds of the RCCPS issue will be used to part finance the expansion and growth of the Group's businesses, including investments in subsidiaries and associated companies as and when they arise."</p>
<p>Each RCCPS carries the right to a preference dividend between 1.5 to 2.5 percent per annum, or otherwise defined by the Directors before the shares are allotted and can be redeemd five years following the issue date or such other date stipulated by the Directors.</p>
<p>The share will be of higher priority than the ordinary shares of S$1.00 each for the payment of preference dividend.</p>
<p>Keppel Bank of Singapore Ltd has been appointed the Singapore co-ordinator for the RCCPS issue, while Robert Fleming and Co. Ltd., the Lead Manager, together with a syndicate of financial institutions will be chosen to subscribe or procure subscriptions for the entire RCCPS issue.</p>
<p>The Stock Exchange of Singapore Limited has approved in principle the listing and quotation of the RCCPS and the New Shares to be issued by the group upon the conversion of the RCCPS.</p>
<p>But the issue of the RCCPS is subject to agreement by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting scheduled for early August.</p>
