<p>Lynch Corp said on Monday that it expects 1997 revenues to grow 15 percent to 20 percent from 1996 and its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to increase at a higher rate.</p>
<p>The company, however, said it expects "minimal earnings in the first quarter of the year" due to the timing of shipments at its Lynch Machinery unit and higher interest expenses, Lynch said.  </p>
<p>In 1996, Lynch reported revenues of $451.9 million and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $33.9 million.</p>
<p>In last year's first quarter, Lynch reported earnings of $1.2 million, or $0.86 a share, on sales of $110.9 million.</p>
