<p>Spain's registered unemployment rate fell to the lowest level in 16 years in July in what economists said on Wednesday was a sure sign that the economy is staging a solid recovery that will continue to generate jobs.</p>
<p>Registered unemployment fell to 12.5 percent in July, down from 13.06 percent in June and from 13.67 percent a year earlier, the Labour Ministry said.</p>
<p>The number of jobless fell a hefty 82,694 people to 2.01 million people.</p>
<p>"For the first time since 1981, the registered unemployment rate has broken 13 percent," Labour Secretary Manuel Pimentel told a news conference. "Unemployment will probably fall below two million in August."</p>
<p>Analysts said they were pleasantly surprised by the data.</p>
<p>"The monthly decline of almost 83,000 is very significant and very strong even if you adjust for seasonal variations," said Jose Luis Alzola, economist at Salomon Brothers in London. "This indicates the economy will enter the third quarter very strong."</p>
<p>The data confirmed that the registered unemployment rate is firmly set on a downward path, and could end the year around 11.5 percent, analysts said.</p>
<p>"In the light of this, the GDP official forecast for 3.2 percent is perfectly possible to achieve and it is good news from a public deficit point of view," said Valentin Fernandez, chief economist at Credit Lyonnais in Madrid.</p>
<p>While Pimentel said registered unemployed would fall below two million in August, he warned that seasonal factors could mean a fresh rise until November before falling back through two million at the end of the year.</p>
<p>In any case, he pointed out that Spain's unemployment was still notably higher than the European average.</p>
<p>"There is still quite a serious distance from Europe," Pimentel said. "We must bring ourselves closer to Europe."</p>
<p>Analysts agreed that Spain still faces a daunting task to rein in Europe's highest official jobless rate.</p>
<p>However, analysts were encouraged by a breakdown of the data that showed that the recovery has now spread to all sectors of the economy.</p>
<p>"The fall was generalised in July, and a sector breakdown shows the recovery is broadening and expanding to construction, which was the laggard in the last few months," Alzola said.</p>
<p>"It shows expansion in services is healthy, manufacturing is expanding well and construction is joining in," he added.</p>
<p>The Labour Ministry also boasted that the quality of jobs has improved since the introduction of labour reforms in May.</p>
<p>The government introduced labour reforms agreed between unions and employers aimed at modernising Spain's rigid labour market in an effort to tame Spain's towering unemployment.</p>
<p>"We not only have more jobs, but better jobs," Pimentel said.</p>
<p>Just over 81,000 contracts were created in July under new labour reform regulations, the ministry said. Of these, almost 65,000 were permanent contracts and more than 16,000 were new training contracts.</p>
<p>"The figures confirm the good performance of the labour market reforms," said Fernandez. "It proves the success for the economy of a more flexible legal framework."</p>
