<p>French stocks finished higher on Friday, buoyed by helpful U.S. data and better-than-expected corporate results, traders said.</p>
<p>"If the results keep coming out this way, the market could get a real bounce," one trader said after a string of companies reported big profit gains for the first half.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed up 8.52 points, or 0.43 percent, at 2,004.75, while the CAC-40 September futures contract climbed 22 points to 2,016.</p>
<p>For the week, the CAC index was up 1.73 percent.</p>
<p>Volume was 3.89 billion francs.</p>
<p>The bourse was swept up with other European markets after the U.S. bond market recovered from an initial fall on a drop in the U.S. unemployment rate to a seven-year low of 5.1 percent.</p>
<p>Relief was provided by the number of jobs created during the month which fell in line with analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>Shares in car parts manufacturer Valeo rose 17.20 francs to 279.70. Several brokers raised their rating on the stock after the company reported a 31 percent jump in its pre-exceptional first-half profit on Thursday.</p>
