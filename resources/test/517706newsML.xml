<p>Connecticut Governor John Rowland will reluctantly approve a dramatic state takeover of Hartford's troubled public school system, Rowland's press secretary said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Republican Rowland will sign the bill, overwhelmingly passed in the state legislature on Wednesday, possibly as early as Friday, press secretary Dean Pagani told Reuters.</p>
<p>"He doesn't want to (sign the bill), but he thinks that there's really no choice, because things have just gotten out of control in Hartford," Pagani said. "This is the only thing that can be done to get things back on the right track."</p>
<p>"You're only a kid once, you only have one chance to get a good education, and these kids aren't getting the education they deserve."</p>
<p>The state has moved for the first time ever to scuttle the Hartford Board of Education and give control of the school system to a board of up to seven trustees.</p>
<p>The trustees will serve for as long as five years, beginning June 1, and will be appointed by Rowland.</p>
<p>Hartford's schools have been in a state of crisis for years, with students traditionally posting the worst scores on statewide tests even though the district ranks among those spending the most per pupil.</p>
<p>Other problems include crumbling buildings, financial mismanagement and intense poverty. About 95 percent of the capital city's 25,000 students are black or Hispanic.</p>
<p>Connecticut's Senate majority leader, Democrat George Jepsen, said the Hartford school situation is only one part of Connecticut's larger urban crisis.</p>
<p>"While I'm glad for what we did yesterday, unless we address underlying urban problems, we're going to face more (crisis) situations down the line," Jepsen told Reuters.</p>
<p>"There's no state in the nation where the disparity between suburban wealth and urban poverty is more acute than in Connecticut. This is easily the richest state in per capita income, and yet we have three of the 10 poorest cities in the nation on a per capita basis (Bridgeport, Hartford and New Haven)."</p>
<p>Jepsen said the state should do more to fight the "vicious cycle" of urban decay.</p>
<p>"As our urban cores become poorer, the tax base diminishes, the capacity to provide essential services diminishes, so taxes go up, which causes more flight of affluent citizens and businesses to suburbs," he said. "People are fleeing. We face a disintegrating situation."</p>
