<p>Corrosion problems in a gas compressor have delayed return to full production at the North Sea Nelson field by a further 10 days, an official at operator Enterprise Oil said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The corrosion was discovered during scheduled maintenance, which ended on Monday, and would lead to a shortfall in production of around 700,000 barrels, the official said.</p>
<p>The Enterprise official said Nelson was producing 50,000-60,000 barrels a day now, with a target of 100,000 bpd in a week. Full capacity flow of 160,000 bpd should resume in 10 days time, he added.</p>
<p>End-June loadings from the Forties system,  which the Nelson field feeds, have already been hit by a slower than anticipated return from maintenance at the Scott field.</p>
<p>Traders said the equivalent of one cargo had been subtracted from the Forties schedule because of difficulties at Scott and the woes at Nelson would cause further June delays and trim July loadings.</p>
<p>A June 28-30 Forties cargo has already been cancelled, though the cause has not been specified.</p>
