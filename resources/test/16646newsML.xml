<p>Caltex (Philippines) Inc, a unit of Caltex Petroleum Corp, announced on Tuesday it will spend $500 million over the next five years to enhance its marketing and refinery facilities in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Caltex Philippines President William Tiffany said in a statement "our current tight cash flow situation and low profitability which we expect until the end of the year have not dampened our long-standing commitment to participate in the growth and progress of this country."</p>
<p>He said the planned investment is aimed at preparing the company for the forthcoming full deregulation of the oil industry.</p>
<p>The government expects to implement full deregulation by March 1997.</p>
<p>Caltex general manager Edgardo Cataquis said the planned investments do not take into account the expansion of the existing refinery. It is only aimed at modernizing its refinery to make it more efficient, he said.</p>
<p>In April this year, Caltex confirmed it was putting on hold its refinery expansion because of its low profitability.</p>
<p>The expansion would have added 65,000 barrels per day (bpd) to the plant's current 72,000 bpd capacity.</p>
<p>Caltex's refinery is in Batangas, south of Manila.</p>
