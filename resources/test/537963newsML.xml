<p>Canadian bonds opened weaker on Friday, with spreads to U.S. long bonds widening as weakness in the Canadian dollar weighed on prices, analysts said.</p>
<p>"I think what's happening here is a little bit of worry now about the Canadian dollar and the implications that might have on the Canadian bond market," said Michael Gregory, a fixed-income economist and strategist with Lehman Brothers Canada Inc.</p>
<p>Canada's 30-year benchmark fell C$0.45 to C$107.57 to yield 7.343 percent.  </p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year bond fell 4/32 to yield 7.14 percent. The spread between the two bonds widened to 20 basis points from 18 basis points at the close of trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar opened easier at C$1.3954 (US$0.7166) on Friday from Thursday's close of C$1.3923 (US$0.7182) as U.S. interest rate hike fears resurfaced and investors became jittery ahead of an expected Canadian federal election call.</p>
<p>Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien is widely expected to call an election this weekend for June 2.  </p>
<p>"Yesterday's comments by the Fed official have sort of raised again the prospects for a Fed move. People are getting nervous about the two big (U.S.) reports next week, the employment cost index and the payroll numbers, and also, there's a lot of buzz now about the election," said Gregory.</p>
<p>Dealers said trading in both Canadian and U.S. fixed-income markets is expected to remain light until next week when the reports on U.S. employment costs and employment growth are released.  </p>
<p>In other prices, the Canadian 10-year benchmark bond fell C$0.35 to C$101.33 to yield 6.807 percent. The U.S. bond fell 2/32 to yield 6.94 percent.</p>
<p>The negative spread between the bonds narrowed to 13 basis points from 18 basis points on Thursday.</p>
<p>The three-month cash T-bill yielded 3.17 percent against its U.S. equivalent which yielded 5.31 percent.</p>
