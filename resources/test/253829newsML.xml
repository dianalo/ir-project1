<p>A decision by seven South Korean petrochemical firms to stop buying naphtha from Japan's Itochu Corp amid price-rigging allegations may further cool already falling prices, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But it was difficult to assess the full impact of the move announced on Wednesday, since it coincided with the largest overnight fall in crude oil prices in recent months.</p>
<p>The seven companies are Daelim Industrial Co, LG Petrochemical Co, Korea Petrochemical Industry Co, Honam Petrochemical Corp, Samsung General Chemicals Co, Hyundai Petrochemical Co and Hanwha Chemical Corp.</p>
<p>"Current naphtha prices have been totally over valued and manipulated by one Japanese trader, Itochu Corp," they said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>Itochu officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>The Korean companies said Japanese spot quotes had been distorted since last week, mainly because of Itochu's purchase of February cargoes despite weaker crude prices and softer European naphtha prices.  </p>
<p>"All companies will suspend physical dealing with the trading company until April arrival cargo, 1997," the statement said. Expanded action would be taken against Itochu unless manipulation stopped, the statement said, giving no details.</p>
<p>Margins at South Korea's petrochemical companies have been hit by rising naphtha prices while prices of downstream products such as ethylene have fallen.</p>
<p>Seoul traders said they expected their move would help bring down high Japanese spot quotes.</p>
<p>"We expect prices to consolidate following the suspension," said a trader at Hanwha Chemical.</p>
<p>Another trader said: "We hope naphtha prices would move more in line with crude prices and stop Itochu from bidding up the prices."</p>
<p>South Korean petrochemical firms had bought an average of 500,000 tonnes of naphtha a year from Itochu, according to the Hanwha trader. The country's annual naptha-cracking capacity is 4.29 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The seven companies are now turning to refiners or other trading houses for naphtha, traders said.  </p>
<p>Possible suppliers are Royal Dutch/Shell, Japan's Marubeni Corp, Mitsui Co, Mitsubishi Corp, Dutch trader Vitol and Swiss trader Glencore.</p>
<p>Traders in Tokyo defended Itochu. However, they said the company was very active in the open-spec naphtha market and was a major force behind recent rising prices.</p>
<p>Itochu is believed to have bid aggressively lately to attract offers amid tight supply, they said.</p>
<p>Regional traders said the bearish impact of the suspension was likely to be limited in the long term.</p>
<p>Open-spec naphtha for first-half February was assessed at $234.00/235.00 a tonne in Thursday afternoon trading, compared with $244.00/$245.00 late Wednesday.</p>
<p>Offers for second-half February were at $230.00, with no bids having emerged. It was quoted at $239.00/240.00 in late Wednesday trading.</p>
<p>Some Singapore traders said naphtha had been overpriced in Asia, but prices were now easing.</p>
<p>"The crack has narrowed," said one Western trader, referring to the naphtha spread with crude. "February Brent and first-half February open-spec is now about $71.00 per tonne compared to $76.00 early this week."  </p>
<p>He said naphtha had come off as higher prices in the East spurred selling on the East-West spread for first-half February/January, now down to $23 per tonne from $25.</p>
<p>Traditionally, naphtha prices towards the end of the year are well-supported as term contract negotiations are carried out, traders said.</p>
