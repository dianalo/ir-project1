<p>Greek culture ministry employees on Thursday suspended a strike that has kept the Athens Acropolis, one of the world's great tourist sites, closed for almost three weeks.</p>
<p>"We are opening the Acropolis as of tomorrow," Panayiotis Stathoulopoulos, president of the Panhellenic Federation of Culture Ministry Unions, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The strike, which has kept Greece's most visited monument closed to tourists since February 10, will be resumed in March if demands for better pay and bonuses are not satisfied, he added.</p>
<p>"This is a suspension and we will come back stronger to press for our demands in a new draft law being formed by the culture ministry," he said.</p>
<p>The Acropolis, a hill overlooking modern Athens topped by the Parthenon, was at the heart of ancient Greek civilisation and can for many be considered the birthplace of European culture.</p>
<p>The strike had also shut down attractions in the northern city of Salonika -- the Archaeological Museum, the Byzantine Museum and the White Tower.</p>
