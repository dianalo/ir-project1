<p>Franz Vranitzky, international mediator for volatile Albania, will have talks on Wednesday with the Balkan nation's prime minister, Bashkim Fino, the Oranisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe said on Monday.</p>
<p>"He will meet Fino and take part in all-party round table talks. He will also talk to (President Sali) Berisha," a spokeswoman for the Vienna-based OSCE told Reuters.</p>
<p>Vranitzky and Fino would travel to the southern towns of Vlore and Shkodra on Thursday, she added.</p>
<p>The south has been the focus of the unrest that has swept Albania since the collapse of a row of fraudulent pyramid investment funds in January.</p>
<p>Vranitzky was scheduled to hold a news conference in Tirana on Thursdaynight before returning to Vienna, the OSCE said.</p>
<p>The first 1,200 troops of an Italian-led international military force, charged with securing aid deliveries in Albania, are due to land in Albania on Tuesday.</p>
