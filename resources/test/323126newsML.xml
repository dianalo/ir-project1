<p>Gross revenue at Cambodia's only deep-water sea port rose 15 percent in 1996 over the previous year while shipping volume grew by five percent, a senior Sihanoukville Port official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Gross revenue for 1996 was $10.2 million, up from nearly $8.9 million in 1995 and nearly double the $5.8 million in 1994. Volume at Sihanoukville port was 741,002 tonnes, up from 707,705 tonnes in 1995 and 547,384 tonnes in 1994, port director Lou Kim Chhun said in an interview with Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the increases were welcome, but warned that the traffic, coupled with expected industrial export growth, made port repairs a priority.</p>
<p>A study by the Japanese government has determined that the jetty, built in the 1950s, will not last beyond the turn of the century and a new container yard will be needed by 1999, Lou Kim Chhun told Reuters.</p>
<p>"We hope that in 1998, the government of Japan will help us. The port is very important to the Cambodian economy," he said.</p>
<p>Lou Kim Chhun attributed the steady increases to growing exports from garment manufacturers, imports of construction materials and improved conditions on national route four into Sihanoukville, which draws traffic from the river port in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>At least two planned industrial zones and a proposed oil storage facility are expected to further boost traffic in the next several years, he said.</p>
