<p>Over 112,000 domestic gas customers in Britain have applied to change supplier in the latest area to open up for competition, Transco, the gas pipeline and transport arm of BG plc, said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>From Friday, the southern English counties of Kent and East and West Sussex become the third pilot area to open up to competition in domestic gas supply.</p>
<p>Until now, households have only been able to buy gas from British Gas plc, now demerged into Centrica plc and BG plc.</p>
<p>But one million consumers in the new pilot area can now buy gas from any of 14 different companies licensed by industry regulator Ofgas to supply the area. Of these, 112,375 have already done so, Transco said.</p>
<p>In April last year, the first pilot area of Devon, Cornwall and Somerset opened to competition. According to Transco, 96,465 out of 500,000 consumers in that area have changed supplier.</p>
<p>And on February 10, a second area, covering Dorset and the former county of Avon, opened up, offering a further 500,000 consumers a choice of supplier. Of these, 31,032 have applied to switch, Transco said.</p>
<p>This brings the total to 239,872 consumers switching.</p>
<p>Clare Spottiswoode, Director General of Gas Supply, welcomed the numbers moving. "This is a clear signal that competition and choice is what people want," she said in a statement.</p>
<p>She pointed out that some of the new suppliers are offering to undercut the standard tariff of British Gas Trading (BGT), the existing supplier, by 20 percent.</p>
<p>"A 20 percent reduction in the average gas bill adds up to 65 stg a year - a saving that's well worth making. If the southeast counties follow the trend set by the first phase, this figure will grow steadily as the word spreads about the benefits of gas competition."</p>
<p>ScottishPower claims to have won more than 50,000, or nearly half, of the switchers in the new pilot area.</p>
<p>"We are extremely pleased to have attracted such an impressive number of customers from virtually a standing start. In two or three months we have accomplished what in different circumstances could have taken two or three years," said Duncan Whyte, executive director - multi-utility.</p>
<p>Competition is expected to be offered to all Britain's 19 million domestic gas customers during 1998. Energy minister Lord Fraser said on Thursday he was in discussion with Clare Spottiswoode over "just what our options are for bringing competition quickly to the rest of the country."</p>
