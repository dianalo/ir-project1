<p>Trading in gold and base metals shares dominated North American stock activity on Wednesday  as investors steered their portfolios away from interest-sensitive stocks to cyclicals, analysts said.</p>
<p>"The market is shifting clearly to cyclical areas, which would include gold and base metals," said Subodh Kumar, chief strategist at CIBC-Wood Gundy in Toronto.</p>
<p>"The focus that people had in 1996 on interest sensitives should be much less in 1997. I think we're seeing this shift."</p>
<p>The price of gold bullion has been moving up in the past few days and looks like will go higher, Kumar said.  </p>
<p>Base metal prices are expected to be higher in 1997 as inventories dwindle and North American and European economies pick up, analysts said. The expectations have prompted a rush on base metal stocks, Kumar added.</p>
<p>On the Toronto Stock Exchange, the base metals group was up 3.22 percent by midday. The heavily weighted gold group was 2.2 percent in brisk trading. On the Philadelphia Stock Exchange, the gold and silver index was up 2.09 percent.</p>
<p>Canada's biggest gold company, Barrick Gold Corp, topped the most actives list.  </p>
<p>Barrick rose C$0.55 to C$38.40 in trading of more than two million shares. On the New York Stock Exchange, Barrick shares rose US$0.50 to 28 7/8.</p>
<p>Gold producers Placer Dome Inc, Echo Bay Mines Ltd, Euro-Nevada Mining Corp Ltd and Teck Corp fuelled the rise in Toronto golds.</p>
<p>In base metals, nickel giant Inco Ltd rose C$2.00 to C$46.15 on trading of almost two million shares. In New York, Inco was up US$1.50 to 34 5/8.</p>
<p>Heavy trading and large gains in Cominco Ltd, Alcan Aluminium Ltd and Westmin Resources Ltd boosted the base metals group.</p>
