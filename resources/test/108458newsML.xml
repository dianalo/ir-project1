<p>Amoco Corp said Thursday it extended its involvement in the Dutch downstream gas market with the formal signing of contracts with the Dutch national gas transmission and distribution company,  Gasunie.</p>
<p>The contracts, signed by Amoco Netherlands B.V. and its partners - Veba Oil Nederland B.V., Dyas B.V. and Energie Beheer Nederland B.V. - relate to the conversion of a largely depleted Amoco-operated gas field in North Holland for underground gas storage.  </p>
<p>The Amoco-operated facility will store and deliver natural gas into the Dutch national transmission system operated by Gasunie to meet increased demand during the winter months.</p>
<p>It is scheduled to be available in time for the 1997-98 peak winter season.</p>
<p>The Peak Gas Installation project is one of the first underground gas storage projects to be built in the Netherlands. Announced last year, it is estimated to cost about US$191 million and will provide up to 24 million cubic meters of gas per day, for short periods. It will have an annual working capacity of 250 million cubic meters.</p>
<p>Amoco Netherlands B.V. has been in the Netherlands for 30 years and is operator of the offshore Rijn field, P15/18 gas field, as well as gas fields onshore in the Bergen Concession area. The company is a subsidiary of Amoco Corp, a global producer and marketer of oil, natural gas, petroluem products and petrochemicals.</p>
