<p>U.S. fixed-income managers channeled funds into government securities and cash over the past week, according to an MCM MoneyWatch Inc survey.</p>
<p>"(The) market is rallying, and this group of investors is shortening up into the move, playing the broader range of the past six months," said MCM money market analyst Peter McTeague, who conducts the asset allocation survey.</p>
<p>The weekly survey showed durations as a percentage of benchmark fell to 105.4 percent in the week ended October 7 from 105.7 percent in the prior week.  </p>
<p>A duration reading above 100 percent indicates the group of investors polled is mostly long on the market.</p>
<p>A portfolio's duration represents its average maturity and is used by portfolio managers to calculate exposure to risk.</p>
<p>In the "next likely move" category, portfolio managers representing 20 percent of total assets in the survey said they would "buy," down from 29 percent the prior week.</p>
<p>Strategists leaning toward "sell" rose to 26 percent, up from 16 percent in the week ended September 30.</p>
<p>Fifty-four percent of managers said they were "neutral" on the market, down from 55 percent a week ago.  </p>
<p>Cash as a percentage of assets rose to 2.89 percent, against 2.80 percent registered the previous week.</p>
<p>The survey showed 21 percent of investors polled overweighted the 10-plus years duration sector, up from 18 percent in the previous week, while 26 percent underweighted it. The remaining 53 percent were "neutral."</p>
<p>In the five- to 10-year duration sector, 35 percent of investors polled said they overweighted the securities and 22 percent underweighted them.  </p>
<p>The survey included 40 domestic participants, who manage about $100 billion in fixed-income assets. The poll is conducted weekly by MCM and usually is released on Tuesday.</p>
