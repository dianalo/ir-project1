<p>Some Wall Street investors are wondering whether Coca-Cola Co's earnings warning Friday will take momentum out of the broader stock market, the Wall Street Journal reported in its "Heard on the Street" column.</p>
<p>"We think this is another sign that the blue chips are tired," Richard Jandrain, senior managing director of stocks at Banc One told the paper. He said investors are moving away from large stocks and toward small-to-midcap issues.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola said Friday its third-quarter earnings would only "slightly exceed" year-earlier results.</p>
<p>The company's stock fell 5.8 percent Friday on the news and another 1.5 percent Monday. On Friday the Dow fell more than 150 points.</p>
<p>Coke closed Monday at 61-3/4. It has been the most actively traded stock on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial average closed up 30.89 at 8062.11 Monday.</p>
