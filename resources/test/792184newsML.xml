<p>Swiss insurer Winterthur Group and banking and financial services group Credit Suisse Group said in a joint statement on Monday that they intended to merge.</p>
<p>The merger, which will be proposed to shareholders at separate extraordinary general meetings, would create an entity with consolidated shareholders' equity of around 23 billion Swiss francs, and assets of around 700 billion francs, they said.</p>
<p>CS and Winterthur said the separate shareholder meetings would be held on September 5.</p>
<p>"If the merger is approved, Credit Suisse Group will subsequently make an exchange offer to Winterthur shareholders, under which Winterthur shares will be exchanged for Credit Suisse Group shares at a ratio of one to 7.3," they said in the joint statement.</p>
<p>Based on the closing price of Credit Suisse Group shares on August 8, 1997 of 208.50, the exchange ratio equates to 1,522 Swiss francs per Winterthur share," they said.</p>
<p>That equated to a premium of seven francs per share on the closing price of Winterthur shares on August 8, and a premium of seven percent over the average price over the last 30 trading days, they said.</p>
<p>The premium was also 36 percent over the market price three months ago, "before bid speculation drove up the Winterthur share price," they said.</p>
