<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said on Thursday he was confident Russia and NATO could come to an agreement about the Atlantic Alliance's eastern expansion before a planned summit in Paris on May 27.</p>
<p>Kohl, speaking after meeting Russian President Boris Yeltsin in this southwestern German spa town, said Germany would help find a solution but would not play the role of an interpretor.  </p>
<p>"I am confident that, with good will on both sides, we can come to an agreement before the NATO-Russia summit on May 27," he said.</p>
<p>France has offered to hold a NATO-Russia summit in late May for the signing of a new charter between the alliance and Moscow.</p>
<p>But NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana said on Wednesday talks between the two sides, although on the right track, might not be over in time for the planned signing.</p>
<p>Russia has sought to win agreement from NATO that it will not permanently station troops or build permanent bases on the territory of new members in Eastern Europe. Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are expecrted to be the first former Warsaw Pact members to be invited to join NATO.</p>
