<p>The OPEC Secretariat on Friday revised up by 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) its forecast for demand for OPEC oil in 1996 to 25 million bpd, the OPEC News Agency (OPECNA) said.  </p>
<p>According to the OPEC monthly oil market report for October, the balance for the third quarter stands at 23.9 million bpd, rising to 25.4 million bpd in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>It says that a stock withdrawal of 1.1 million bpd took place during the first quarter of 1996 and there were stock build-ups of 1.6 million and 1.9 million during the second and third quarters, respectively.</p>
<p>Next year, OPEC forecats quarterly demand for OPEC oil at 26 million bpd, 23.7 million bpd, 24.3 million bpd, and 26.3 million bpd.  </p>
<p>The demand forecast contrasts with current OPEC production of about 25.82 million bpd which selected secondary sources estimated was the production of the 11-member group in September, the Secretariat said.</p>
<p>OPEC did not provide an official figure for overall OPEC production becuase one member, Venezuela, did not provide its data.</p>
<p>The oil producers' group next meets in late November to set production levels for 1997. Despite the current high oil price, OPEC delegates, including those from heavyweight Saudi Arabia, expect a rollover of the current 25.033 million bpd ceiling.</p>
