<headline>Reckitt up on short squeeze, takeover rumor.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-02</dateline>

<p>Shares in British household products group Reckitt and Colman Plc scored record highs on Wednesday on another round of rumours, which have circulated for the last few months, of a take-over bid by Unilever Plc , traders said.</p>
<p>But traders were sceptical of the rumour and said the gains were more likely from a short squeeze.</p>
<p>A Reckitt spokesman had no comment on the speculation and described its share activity as normal trading.</p>
<p>"Very little has been traded and it appears people want the stock and there is very little around," he said.</p>
<p>Shares were up 24-1/2p at 937p at 1337 GMT after hitting a high of 940p. Shares in other household goods companies were mixed.</p>
<p>"There are rumours that Unilever is going to do something big and whether that is rolling over to Reckitt, it probably is," said one market maker.</p>
<p>Unilever was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Its shares were off 1/2p at 17.56p after also hitting a record high of 17.80p.</p>
<p>Unilever on Monday said it sold its John West Foods business for an undisclosed sum and was not significant in relation to its assets.</p>
<p>A trader said that was not significant enough to spark fresh rumours of a Unilever bid for Reckitt.</p>
<p>"We would say the stock is up 20 pence and someone is trying to think of a reason for it," another market maker said. "There is no stock around."</p>
