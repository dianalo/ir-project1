<headline>Fiery dlr pauses in Europe, sizes up 1.80 marks.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Dollar/mark was glowing in late Europe from its early-morning sprint to almost six-year highs, pausing for breath as it sized up the key 1.80 marks hurdle.</p>
<p>General mark weakness on persistent speculation of a broad-based start to monetary union saw sterling/mark continue its dazzling bull run to hit levels not seen since October 1990, and mark/yen dive to its weakest point in nearly two years.</p>
<p>But analysts warned that a dollar break of 1.80 marks could prompt an official response. "We'll probably continue this move for now...but you've got to be very wary that the central banks might be in the background," said David Coleman at CIBC.  </p>
<p>"The 1.80 level is where we'd expect the Bundesbank to be around -- not necessarily in terms of intervention, but in terms of more comments of the Tietmeyer ilk we saw last week," said Coleman, who is CIBC's chief economist in London.</p>
<p>Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer interrupted the mark's decline -- albeit briefly -- when he said last week that the dollar's correction against the German currency was over.</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 1.7901/06 marks at 1511 GMT, off the nearly six-year peak of 1.7960 it scaled in early Europe but still well above late Friday's level here of 1.7700/10.  </p>
<p>Dollar/yen was sidelined, changing hands at 113.64/74 compared to 113.84/89 at Friday's close.</p>
<p>Sterling was a prime mover, meanwhile, setting a fresh high of 3.0327 marks during the session before backtracking slightly to 3.0225/34. That compared with 2.9985/95 late last week.</p>
<p>Analysts said the pound continued to profit from the subdued German economic outlook, ongoing concerns of a broad-based EMU, and the prospect of higher British interest rates.</p>
<p>"Sterling continues firm against the mark, providing another platform for a weak mark and a strong dollar as well," said Jeremy Stretch, currency strategist at Natwest Markets here.  </p>
<p>The pound's relentless strength pulled the Irish punt to its highest since its 1993 devaluation. The punt, currently the strongest currency in the ERM grid, was trading some 13 percent above its central rate against the weakest, the French franc.</p>
<p>The mark was off lows on some crosses in late trade, notably against the lira amid market talk of Bank of Italy intervention, but analysts said the risk remained to the downside.</p>
<p>"The weight of opinion in the market is still to sell marks and the only thing that seems capable of turning that around is a delay to EMU, which seems very unlikely," said Steve Barrow, economist at Credit Lyonnais in London.  </p>
<p>The day lacked U.S. economic data, but the market was gearing up for a swathe of indicators later this week. U.S. June retail sales figures, due out Tuesday, and CPI on Wednesday are among the scheduled releases.</p>
<p>The figures should bolster expectations that U.S. interest rates will stay on hold for now, analysts said.</p>
<p>The market continued to keep a watchful eye on the turbulence in Asian currencies, which has buoyed the dollar of late. The Philippine peso, Malaysian ringitt and Thai baht all made new lows overnight.</p>
<p>"The dollar is the vehicle currency in Asia and will be supported as long as the speculators attack the local currencies," said a dealer at a U.S. bank here.</p>
