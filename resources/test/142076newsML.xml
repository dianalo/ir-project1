<p>A default by South Korean piano maker Samick Musical Instruments Co Ltd on Thursday unnerved stock investors worried that the music will stop playing for other financially-strapped smaller firms.</p>
<p>On Wednesday the Korea Exchange Bank, Samick's primary lender, said the world's third biggest maker of musical instruments had defaulted on payments on 2.7 billion won ($3.3 million) worth of promissory notes.</p>
<p>Some analysts said it was likely the company would be rescued. But stock investors fretted about the overall health of small companies, many of them suffering from a cash crunch as a result of high interest rates and an export slowdown.</p>
<p>There was some concern about banks with exposure to small firms, the weakest link in South Korea's troubled economy.</p>
<p>Offsetting those fears was news of a two percentage point cut in the bank reserve requirement ratio from November 8 -- a move seen leading to lower interest rates.</p>
<p>Trading in Samick was suspended on Thursday for the second day. It will resume on Friday but the company will be put on a watch list. The shares last traded at 6,140 won.</p>
<p>The leading stock market index ended down 7.54 points at a provisional close of 804.44.</p>
<p>"Small-cap firms could be hurt by the failure news because they always suffer from money supply squeeze," said Choi Kwon-uk, a fund manager at Seoul Investment Trust Co.</p>
<p>Analysts said Samick was likely to apply for court receivership, although a Korea Exchange bank official said no agreement had been reached between Samick and creditors.</p>
<p>Under receivership the company could be restructured with a view to finding a buyer.</p>
<p>"It's most likely that a third party will take over Samick," said Kim Byong-sok, a financial analyst at Hannuri-Salomon Securities.</p>
<p>Samick's total debt stood at 362.5 billion won at the end of June against assets of 372.5 billion. The company posted a net loss of 1.9 billion won in the first half of this year on turnover of 109.6 billion won.</p>
<p>"Samick has a worldwide recognition as a top piano manufacturer. The government wouldn't want to liquidate a company with an international brand name," said Kim.</p>
<p>Analysts said a string of overseas acquisitions in the past several years, plus investments of $18 million in a wood processing plant in Indonesia and $5 million in a piano factory in China, had buried Samick under a mountain of debt.</p>
<p>"Between 1989 and 1991 there was a huge boom of having pianos in middle class households. It was like a status thing," said Chung Jae-yeol, a Ssangyong Securities analyst.</p>
<p>Then consumer tastes changed and "people wanted to have computers in their homes rather than pianos".</p>
<p>Analysts said a weakening Japanese yen also hit Samick's competitiveness against its big rival, Japan's Yamaha Corp.</p>
