<p>Deutsche Bank AG's new chief executive Rolf Breuer was quoted on Tuesday as saying he plans to reduce the bank's industrial holdings in German companies in a bid to achieve a balance between its domestic and international holdings.</p>
<p>Breuer, who takes over as chief executive after Deutsche's annual shareholders' meeting on Tuesday, was quoted as telling the Financial Times in an interview that there could eventually be a 50-50 balance between holdings in German companies and those held abroad.</p>
<p>But he added this would probably not happen until the next century and depended on how quickly taxes would be cut.</p>
<p>"We are a Eruopean bank, we want to be the number one bank in Europe and in the euro, and we basically have a portfolio of only German industrial holdings," Breuer said.</p>
<p>"I have always said we want to Europeanise, if not internationalise our portfolio."</p>
<p>Deutsche's holdings in German industrial companies include a 22.6 percent stake in Daimler-Benz AG and 10 percent in insurer Allianz AG Holding AG.  </p>
<p>Its stakes also include 25.8 percent of Philip Holzmann AG, Deutz AG, 10 percent of Munich Reinsurance and 10.2 percent of Continental AG.</p>
<p>Breuer also said that international diversification of its holdings would provide more shareholder value for investors, the paper said.</p>
