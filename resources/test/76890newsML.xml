<p>Foreign direct investment (FDI) amongst developed countries has risen sharply since a trough in 1993 to make up two thirds of all inflows and 85 percent of total outflows in 1995, the United Nations said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Data in the latest World Investment Report from the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) showed growth of FDI inflows to developed countries was greatest for the United States, Britain, France and Australia. The United States, Britain and Germany also invested the most abroad.</p>
<p>FDI inflows to the United States surged by more than 21 percent over the 1994 level, reaching $60 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>This was more than all inflows to developing countries in 1992 and was twice the size of inflows to Britain in 1995.</p>
<p>"Increases in inflows in 1995 were recorded in equity capital flows and reinvested earnings," the report said. "Reflecting a strong recovery of M&amp;A (merger and acquisition) activity by Western European transnational corporations, equity flows to the U.S. grew by 15 percent to $39.5 billion".</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology were the favoured sectors, with reinvested earnings almost tripling from 1994 to $13.3 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Germany was the largest investor in the United States with $11 billion, followed by Britain with $10 billion. Japan's transnational corporations (TNCs) invested $4.0 billion.</p>
<p>The United States also invested far more abroad than any other country in 1995, with outflows of $100 billion. This was $58 billion more than the next highest investor, Britain.</p>
<p>Most of U.S. FDI abroad -- about 60 percent in 1994-95 -- was financed by reinvested earnings, with intra-company loans declining by 42 percent to some $4.7 billion. This is partly explained by the interest rate differential between the United States and other countries, the UNCTAD report said.</p>
<p>Britain was the most favoured destination for U.S. FDI, but it was also attractive to firms from Western Europe and Japan, especially through mergers and aquisitions.</p>
<p>"Relatively low costs and corporate taxes in comparison with other European Union members have played a role in attracting FDI into the United Kingdom," UNCTAD said.</p>
<p>Outflows from Britain in 1995 also reached a record $38 billion, headed mainly for the United States and European Union.</p>
<p>Germany saw FDI inflows rise sharply in 1995 after negative inflow in 1994 because of the strong mark and high corporate taxes. The new investment was mainly in real estate and holding companies, anticipating further mark strength, UNCTAD said.</p>
<p>The report also noted that although the United States does more trade with Asia than Western Europe, there are more FDI flows from the U.S. to western Europe.</p>
<p>"This is likely to be the case for some time, but the rates of increase in FDI flows from the United States towards Asia are now greater than those inflows towards Western Europe, with annual rates respectively 6.6 percent and 4.3 percent." It suggests "the Asia century has not yet begun for the U.S.".</p>
<p>On Japan, UNCTAD said its FDI policies had evolved from strategies to offset restrictions in key markets in the 1980s to a focus on strengthening global competitiveness now.</p>
<p>It noted that Japanese trading companies have around 5,500 foreign affiliates worldwide but only 85 of them are in Africa and 60 in central and eastern Europe, mainly because of weak historical and trade links with these regions and little official development assistance.</p>
