<p>About 10 Filipino professional boxers, including a former world champion, have gone missing in Japan in the last five years and are suspected of becoming illegal workers, the daily Tokyo Shimbun reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the missing included former International Boxing Federation (IBF) straw-weight world champion Melcho Sasaki, former Japan featherweight champion John Tan Sasaki, former Philippines lightweight champion Flash Ray Sekiyama and former Asia-Pacific junior middleweight champion Armand Picard.</p>
<p>They arrived in Japan with boxing visas to seek titles or work as sparring partners but disappeared from their boxing gyms because of low fight money or sparring fees, the Tokyo Shimbun said.</p>
<p>An Immigration Department spokesman had no comment on the report.</p>
<p>Holders of boxing visas cannot engage in other work in Japan.</p>
<p>Because of rigid training, boxers can only contest a maximum of four or five fights a year, which means their income rarely tops one million yen ($8,600), far below the average Japanese worker's income.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that in June, the Tokyo Immigration Bureau found and arrested eight Filipino boxers working illegally when agents raided three metalwork factories in Ibaraki prefecture, north of Tokyo.</p>
<p>It said the arrested boxers complained they were forced to take up illegal work because they could not make ends meet on their meagre pay from boxing matches and as sparring partners.</p>
<p>There are regular reports of foreign sportsmen and women, generally from poorer Asian nations, disappearing into Japan's workforce while competing in Japan in international events.</p>
<p>Last month, four members of Nepal's national soccer team, in Japan to play the first round of preliminary matches for the World Cup Asia Zone, disappeared from their hotel on their last day in Japan.</p>
<p>During the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, a number of Sri Lankan athletes went missing.</p>
