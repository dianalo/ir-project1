<p>Surplus world sugar supplies could push down prices in the coming months, and should make producers think twice about expanding output, a senior international sugar official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Peter Baron, executive director of the International Sugar Organisation (ISO), said early indications pointed to world production outstripping consumption in the 1996/97 season starting on October 1 for the third consecutive year.</p>
<p>He said the surplus was expected to be smaller than 1995/96 season's output but could weigh on prices nevertheless.</p>
<p>"This might put prices under downward pressure," Baron said at the start of the three-day Asia International Sugar Conference in New Delhi.</p>
<p>On the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange on Monday, October sugar futures settled up 0.03 cent at 12.03 cents a pound.</p>
<p>Delegates from Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Indonesia and Britain were among those attending the conference.</p>
<p>"We are facing a third year of surplus, and this should make us (think twice) when it comes to thinking about expanding production for export purposes because there will be problems on the export markets, that is sure," Baron said.</p>
<p>However, over the past 15 months, sugar prices have remained relatively high despite statistical surpluses, he said.</p>
<p>The ISO official did not give a forecast for world sugar supply and demand, and said the organisation hoped to release its initial "assumptions" in October.</p>
<p>S.L. Jain, chief executive of the Indian Sugar Mills Association, said 1995/96 world sugar production totalled 121.9 million tonnes, while consumption was 118.4 million.</p>
<p>Baron said India, the world's largest sugar producer, would not repeat its "spectacular" production performance of the past year in the new season starting in October.</p>
<p>India is expected to produce a record 16.45 million tonnes of sugar in 1995/96, up sharply from 14.6 million in 1994/95, according to domestic industry estimates.</p>
<p>Output in 1996/97 has been intitially forecast by the industry at about 15 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Vivek Saraogi, president of the Indian Sugar Mills Association, said India's sugar output increased by almost 50 percent between 1989 and 1995, while world production grew by 12 percent.</p>
<p>Baron said the market expected key players, including Thailand, Australia, Brazil and South Africa, to expand output in the future.</p>
<p>He said Asia would remain the driving force of the world sugar economy in terms of production, consumption and trade.</p>
<p>Asia accounts for 29 percent of world sugar production, 37 percent of consumption, 46 percent of imports and 17 percent of exports.</p>
