<p>LaTex Resources Inc said on Friday it had given Alliance Resources Plc an additional 12 days, until September 27, to pursue acquisitions, saying it hoped this would lead to a larger and financially stronger combined company when LaTex and Alliance merge.</p>
<p>Originally, the merger agreement gave Alliance until September 15 to pursue further acquisitions, subject to LaTex approval.</p>
<p>"We granted the extension in order to provide Alliance with sufficient time to explore other acquisitions in order to make the combined company a larger and financially stronger player in the energy industry, and to make the merger tax-free for LaTex shareholders," LaTex Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Wilson said in a statement.</p>
<p>Wilson said that if Alliance were not successful in making additional acquisitions by September 27, "we anticipate restructuring the merger to accomplish a tax-free exchange for LaTex shareholders."</p>
<p>LaTex is involved in the production, exploration and marketing of crude oil and natural gas.</p>
