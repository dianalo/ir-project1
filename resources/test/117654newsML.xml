<p>Pakistan's Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) said on Tuesday it had recovered two billion rupees ($54 million) from loan defaulters in the past month.</p>
<p>FIA Assistant Director General Rehman Malik told reporters loan repayments had picked up recently, citing this as evidence that the campaign against big defaulters was working.</p>
<p>Malik said several bankers and businessmen had been arrested on charges of fraud, embezzlement and default in recent months.</p>
<p>Loan recoveries amounted to two billion rupees in cash and assets seized by the FIA, Malik said.</p>
<p>On October 13 the FIA secured the extradition of a former vice-president of state-owned United Bank Ltd from Dubai who was charged with misappropriating 500 million rupees, he said.</p>
<p>Malik said the Pakistan Banking Council had set up a special account to hold money recovered by the FIA. Creditors would be repaid from that account.</p>
<p>Pakistani banks have huge portfolios of bad debts estimated to total more than 120 billion rupees.</p>
