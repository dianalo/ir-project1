<p>A committee formed to study the privatisation of El Al Israel Airlines recommends selling 100 percent of the state carrier on the Tel Aviv stock market in the first half of 1998, government sources said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The committee, headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's economic adviser, Moshe Leon, will present its recommendations to Netanyahu and Transport Minister Yitzhak Levy on Sunday.</p>
<p>The panel advises selling all of the government holdings at once, in shares and warrants.</p>
<p>The panel rejected a suggestion to sell the airline to a strategic investor, out of concern the government would not get a good price because of El Al's losses.</p>
<p>Newspaper reports have said the carrier expected to lose $40 million in 1997 following steep losses in 1996.</p>
<p>A major obstacle to privatisation -- a prohibition against flying on the Jewish Sabbath -- would also be dealt with under the committee's plan, which would allow El Al to fly on the Sabbath as long as this does not increase the overall air traffic on this day.</p>
<p>This would mean the number of incoming and outgoing flights from Friday evening to Saturday evening would remain at the present level. The committee believes this would be acceptable to religious parties.</p>
<p>The committee also recommends setting aside funds before the privatisation to guarantee full compensation for workers who are fired.</p>
<p>Another recommendation calls for continued government participation in funding El Al's costly security.</p>
<p>After the blueprint for El Al's sale is approved by Netanyahu and Levy, it will be submitted to the entire Cabinet and then to the parliamentary finance committee.</p>
