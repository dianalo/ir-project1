<p>The Dutch Central Bank and the government have agreed that the central government will stabilise its balance with the Bank at a target level of 50 million guilders, the Central Bank said in a statement.</p>
<p>As of January 1 1997, in principle, balances in excess of this target level will be invested by the central government in the money market, and balances below the level will be replenished by borrowing in the moneymarket, the statement said.  </p>
<p>At the moment, the balance of the central government with the bank hovers around the 10 billion guilder level.</p>
<p>The move to reduce this balance was announced in September at the presentation of the Dutch budget, and is in preparation for the third phase of EU economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>"A stable Treasury balance with the Bank will facilitate the conduct of the future European money market policy," it said.</p>
<p>It said stabilisation of the balance would reduce money market volatility and favourably affect the introduction of new instruments of money market policy in the course of 1997.</p>
<p>The balance can fluctuate around 50 million guilders to cope with contingencies.</p>
<p>The Central Bank said it had agreed with the Ministry of Finance to raise the amount of outstanding Dutch Treasury Certificates (DTCs) from 15 billion guilders to a maximum of 30 billion guilders at any particular point.</p>
<p>According to the central bank, this would eliminate the need for maintaining a higher balance with the bank as an additional buffer to absorb fluctuations in liquidity.</p>
<p>"In addition to placements of DTCs, other instruments will also be used to stabilise the Treasury balance," the Bank said.</p>
<p>DTCs are short-term loans issued by the central government.</p>
