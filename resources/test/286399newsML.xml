<p>Italian companies are less pessimistic about economic prospects, but see only modest industrial activity in the first quarter of 1997 with inflation falling less rapidly, state economic research body Isco said.</p>
<p>In its latest survey of a sample group of industries, Isco said "company forecasts about economic developments showed slightly less pessimism," and expectations were for "activity to settle back at around current levels."</p>
<p>Companies saw substantial stability in the consumer goods sector but a slight fallback in investment goods. As for prices, they saw some signs of the falling trend slowing, Isco said.</p>
