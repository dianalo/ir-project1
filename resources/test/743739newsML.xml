<p>NOVA Corp said on Monday that natural gas flows on its Grande Prairie mainline in northeastern Alberta began to climb back up to capacity over the weekend and full service was expected by the end of today.</p>
<p>About one billion cubic feet of gas a day was off the system between July 13 and 18 while NOVA Gas Transmission Ltd conducted maintenance and inspection on the 3.8 billion cubic feet a day pipeline.</p>
<p>"The actual flows still aren't back to normal. I assume some plants chose not to come back on for the weekend," NGTL operations engineer Jeff Stoffregen said.</p>
<p>"By the end of today, I would expect the flows to be back to normal," Stoffregen said.</p>
<p>The outage was originally slated to be wrapped up on Thursday, but mechanical problems with an in-line inspection tool, or pig, delayed the restart by a day.</p>
