<p>International mediators sided with Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic on Friday in her power struggle with nationalists accused of corrupting the government and obstructing peace.</p>
<p>Plavsic, trying to face down wartime leader and indicted war criminal Radovan Karadzic, on Thursday raised the stakes by ordering the dissolution of the Bosnian Serb assembly and setting new elections for September 1.</p>
<p>She was supported by 7,000 demonstrators who gathered outside her office in the northern town of Banja Luka and urged her not to back down.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry this happened but crime must be stopped," Plavsic told them. "(War) victims did not fall for a state of thieves but for a state of honest people."</p>
<p>Her confrontation with hardliners loyal to Karadzic grew as the Bosnian Serb parliament prepared to meet in defiance of her dissolution order.</p>
<p>Representatives of the United Nations and Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Sarajevo said Plavsic was right under the constitution to disband parliament and that its work would not be recognised by the international community.</p>
<p>Simon Haselock, spokesman for the U.N. High Representative in Bosnia, told reporters: "Since the assembly has been dissolved, anything that meets this afternoon cannot be considered an assembly meeting."</p>
<p>He added: "Clearly the international community will deal only with constitutionally recognised bodies. But we still have to see what happens in the next 24 hours. That will be crucial."</p>
<p>The parliament was due to start during the afternoon at an alpine ski resort outside Karadzic's stronghold of Pale near Sarajevo.</p>
<p>Leaders of the ruling SDS party, which Karadzic still covertly controls, met overnight to plan the session. They kept their tactics secret and did not reveal whether they would go ahead with their threat to topple Plavsic.</p>
<p>Government sources said the hardliners might soften their tactics and play for breathing space by referring Plavsic's actions to the constitutional court.</p>
<p>Western mediators did not hide that efforts to rebuild Bosnia on the basis of the 1995 Dayton peace agreement were at a turning point.</p>
<p>A diplomat in Sarajevo said: "If we are willing to see the one person in power in Republika Srpska (Serb Republic) who is willing to carry out the peace agreement be crushed by an indicted war criminal, where are we?"</p>
<p>Karadzic's chances of forcing the parliament to do his bidding improved when the 14-strong block of legislators from the Moslem SDA party decided not to attend.</p>
<p>Without their votes, it was unlikely that opposition to the hardliners would be strong enough to prevent them getting their way.</p>
<p>By making public allegations of corruption against named government leaders and shedding light on Karadzic's illegal influence, Plavsic has dealt the Bosnian Serb wartime leadership a possibly crippling blow.</p>
<p>Karadzic aide Jovan Zametica told reporters in Pale: "I am not ready to say that we have a consititutional crisis but we definitely have a political crisis."</p>
<p>The independent Belgrade news agency Beta quoted Plavsic as saying she feared her life may be in danger as a result of her revelations.</p>
<p>She alleged that three members of Bosnian Serb state security forces who were found in a room opposite her office on Thursday were monitoring her movements.</p>
