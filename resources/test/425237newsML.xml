<p>Indonesia's largest cement maker PT Semen Gresik said on Thursday it had changed its depreciation policy, which a company official said might have implications for its 1996 net profit.</p>
<p>"We have revised our depreciation policy to eight years from four years," the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the policy change for its plants was advantageous for its pre-tax level but it would also increase its tax rate.</p>
<p>"Profit before tax is likely to be higher, but the bottom line will also be affected," the official, who asked not to be named, said.</p>
<p>The official declined to give any indication of the company's consolidated 1996 net profit.</p>
<p>"We are still consolidating our results, including those from Semen Tonasa and Semen Padang. The final results will be announce in late March," he said.</p>
<p>In late afternoon trade, Semen Gresik rose 25 rupiah to 6,475 rupiah with about two million shares changing hands.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, many foreign investors unloaded Semen Gresik shares in anticipation of a possible earnings revision due to the changes in its depreciation policy. Its shares dropped 7.5 percent on Wednesday.</p>
