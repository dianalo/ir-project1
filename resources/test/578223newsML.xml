<p>Louisiana Land and Exploration Co said Tuesday it had raised by 15 percent its capital budget for 1997, to $277 million, in order to drill wells in Indonesia and the United States.</p>
<p>"The majority of the budget increase is the result of additional wells to be drilled following exploratory and exploitation successes experienced in (the company's) core areas of operations already this year," it said.  </p>
<p>The company said it will drill at least 15 additional wells, bringing the total for the year to 105.</p>
<p>"New wells will be added in the Gulf of Mexico, south Louisiana, the Rocky Mountains and Indonesia," it said.</p>
<p>The company said it had allocated $197 million for exploration and $60 million for development or exploitation.</p>
<p>It said it will spend 76 percent of the exploratory budget and 63 percent of the development budget in the United States.</p>
