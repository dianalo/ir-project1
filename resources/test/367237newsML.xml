<p>The anti-Nazi Simon Wiesenthal centre appealed to British authorities on Monday to avoid comparisons between the World War Two persecution of European Jewry and running communal troubles in northern Ireland.</p>
<p>A statement from the center's European office said it had asked British Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Patrick Mayhew to drop plans for a government television ad which would make such a comparison.</p>
<p>"Such relativisation of the Holocaust is tantamount to the banalisation of its lessons. Neither does it serve to clarify the conflict in northern Ireland," wrote the center's European director Shimon Samuels.</p>
<p>Samuels said the proposed film compared a Protestant march on Sunday against a Catholic church in Ballymena, Northern Ireland, with "Kristalnacht" (Crystal Night) in Germany in 1938 when Nazis attacked hundreds of synagogues and Jewish homes across the country.</p>
