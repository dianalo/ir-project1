<p>India's Congress party and the ruling United Front alliance on Friday inched towards talks to end a political crisis started by Congress's withdrawal of vital support to the government.</p>
<p>The 15-party United Front coalition said it was willing to talk to its rival but refused to budge on a Congress demand that Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda should step down to make way for a Congress-led coalition.</p>
<p>The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), whose 12-day-old government fell last May when Congress and the United Front closed ranks, said it would decide on a strategy at a weekend meeting of the party's national executive committee.</p>
<p>Congress spokesman Vithal Gadgil told Reuters the party stood behind party president Sitaram Kesri, but added that talks with Deve Gowda's centre-left alliance were possible.</p>
<p>Asked whether Congress was ready for talks to end the crisis, Gadgil said: "Let the proposal come." Asked if the Congress was open for talks, he said: "Yes, yes."</p>
<p>Kesri withdrew the party's make-or-break support to the minority government headed by Deve Gowda on Sunday, citing economic drift and the government's weakness in containing Hindu nationalists in the opposition.</p>
<p>The 15-party United Front (UF), made up of centrists, regional groups and communists, is scheduled to face a vote of confidence in the lower house of parliament on April 11.</p>
<p>Politicians said hectic talks were on behind the scenes between middle-ranking Congress and United Front leaders to avoid premature elections after the last polls held a year ago.</p>
<p>Later on Friday, Gadgil told a news conference that Congress insisted on forming a new government. "The only solution to the present political solution is a Congress-led coalition at the centre (federal government)," he said.</p>
<p>United Front spokesman Jaipal Reddy said talks towards forming a joint body to iron out differences were possible, but that the coalition would not meet Congress's demand for power.</p>
<p>"A change in the leadership is non-negotiable," he said. "The question of supporting a Congress-led coalition does not arise at all."</p>
<p>The convenor of the United Front's decision-making Steering Committee, Chandrababu Naidu, might consider issuing an invitation for talks, Reddy said. Naidu was expected to reach Delhi on Sunday.</p>
<p>"There is absolutely no difficulty or hesitation in sending a formal invitation," Reddy said. "We are ready to discuss modalities for structured interaction."</p>
<p>On Thursday, the United Front snubbed a key demand from the Congress to replace Deve Gowda after Kesri said on Tuesday that the Congress would reconsider its position if he resigned.</p>
<p>"What is significant is that the Congress in the past few days has come to terms with reality," said analyst Mahesh Rangarajan of New Delhi's Centre for Contemporary Studies.</p>
<p>Deve Gowda could survive the trust vote only if Congress split or lawmakers in the main opposition Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party abstained. The government would need a simple majority of members present and voting.</p>
<p>The BJP and its allies control 193 votes in the 545-seat lower house. The United Front has 180 votes and Congress 140.</p>
