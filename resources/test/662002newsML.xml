<p>Pakistan's 1997/98 (July-June) budget is likely to nurture growth, but prospects for achieving fiscal balance are uncertain, analysts said on Saturday.</p>
<p>They said the 552-billion-rupee ($13.63-billion) budget announced by Finance Minister Sartaj Aziz on Friday had kept faith with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's supply-side strategy of tax and tariff cuts to stimulate export-led growth.</p>
<p>"It is a brave budget as no new revenue measures have been imposed and it should boost growth. But there seem to be too many assumptions," Jahanzeb Naseer, research head at Jardine Fleming Pakistan, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"What remains to be seen is how the expected growth can compensate for the decline in revenues expected in the short term because of the tax and tariff cuts," he said.</p>
<p>Aziz said the government expected to garner an extra 6.2 billion rupees in tax revenue and 3.6 billion rupees in non-tax revenue by broadening the tax base without imposing new taxes.</p>
<p>The fiscal deficit would be held to 64.65 billion rupees, down from an estimated 88.64 billion rupees in 1996/97, he said.</p>
<p>Raza Mirza, chief analyst at brokers KASB &amp; CO, said it was too early to say whether the deficit could be controlled by an all-out push for growth where previous governments had sought to bridge the gap by piling on new taxes.</p>
<p>"It is a bold non-tax budget, banking on the supply-side assumption that lowering costs would result in higher production," Mirza said.</p>
<p>"The basic theme of the budget is revival of the economy through higher GDP (gross domestic product) growth which would bring down the deficit."</p>
<p>Naseer agreed that curbing the deficit against a backdrop of tax and tariff cuts would be the government's sternest task.</p>
<p>"I think we should give them (government) two to three months before judging whether the measures would work," he said.</p>
<p>Naseer said the two percent rise in the defence allocation to 134 billion rupees $3.3 billion) was a real cut if adjusted for inflation now running at about 13 percent.</p>
<p>"The cut in defence expenditure will go down well with foreign investors and lenders," he said, adding apart from debt servicing and development, spending had been cut five percent.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund has agreed to start talks in July on a new medium-term loan to Pakistan to support its balance of payments while structural reforms are implemented.</p>
<p>"For economic growth, it (the budget) is good but the fiscal equation will remain risky," Naseer said.</p>
