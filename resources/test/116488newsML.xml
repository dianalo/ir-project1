<headline>Dollar rallies, ends European session near peaks.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-15</dateline>

<p>The dollar settled close to 33-month peaks against the yen and just below 18-week highs against the mark at the European close as oil and stock markets boomed, traders said.</p>
<p>Sizzling oil prices, which on Tuesday surged to their highest level since early 1991, combined with soaring US and European stock markets to fuel the currency cocktail.</p>
<p>"We've had a big oil rally, which has been detrimental to the yen... and the strong performance of the Dow Jones and the FTSE has helped sterling and the dollar," Banque Paribas analyst Andrew Chaveriat said.  </p>
<p>At 1446 GMT, the dollar was at 112.30/35, up from 111.59/64 late in Europe on Monday and just off the 112.35 peak hit earlier on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The yen, weakened by the spike in oil prices - a key import in Japan  - is also under pressure ahead of Sunday's general election, analysts said.</p>
<p>Latest opinion polls show Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party could win an outright majority.</p>
<p>"The general backdrop is definitely favouring the Anglo-Saxon currencies at the expense of core Europe and Japan," said Peter von Maydell, senior currency economist at UBS.  </p>
<p>But despite a strong fundamental backdrop for the dollar, chartists said overhead congestion could cap its rally at the 112.35 peak.</p>
<p>Against the mark, the dollar traded above 1.54 marks for the first time since late May. It last stood at 1.5396/1.5402 marks, up a pfennig from Monday's European close at 1.5293/97.</p>
<p>Sterling also made powerful advances, rising over two pfennigs in hectic trade to 21-month highs versus the mark.</p>
<p>Dealers said the pound's rise was being underpinned by a record high in UK stocks, firmer oil prices and Britain's relative isolation from the debate swirling over EMU.  </p>
<p>"It would be a foolish man to bet against sterling going higher," said international economist Adrian Schmidt at Chase Investment Bank.</p>
<p>Sterling surged a pfennig and a half in European trade and stood at 2.4372/77 at 1520 GMT, up over two pfennigs from late Monday's European level of 2.4160/65.</p>
<p>Dealers said the only negative factor looming over the pound at the moment was on the political front, although Chancellor Kenneth Clarke has pledged economic prudence in next month's budget rather than a vote-winning giveaway ahead of next year's election.  </p>
<p>Britain's detachment from the debate over European economic and monetary union (EMU) provided respite for dealers nervous about the continuing uncertainties of entry surrounding other European currencies, analysts said.</p>
<p>For the dollar, analysts said the outlook remained generally rosy. "The one negative thing for the dollar is its (U.S) fairly large trade deficit," said Andrew Smith, chief economist at Credit Lyonnais Laing. " In absolute numbers it is still very high even if it has shrunk to the proportion of GDP," he said.</p>
