<p>The New Zealand dollar held firm in the centre of its narrow early week channel on Wednesday in trade that continues to be dominated by the uncertain prospects of Friday's Monetary Policy Statement.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Kiwi's start at 0.6840/47 reflected a firmer tone than seen on Monday and Tuesday, with trading levels subdued ahead of the Japanese tankan report, due around midday.</p>
<p>"There are still quite a few open positions and we could well get some movement (on Friday). Short-term this market is looking for rallies," a senior Auckland dealer said.  </p>
<p>Another overnight Eurobond, a NZ$100 million five-year from BayerVB, showed that a key line of support for the currency's international profile remains intact.</p>
<p>However, the economists' view remains that the MPS will open the way for more easing of monetary conditions and therefore tend to undermine the dollar.</p>
<p>HSBC, in a market note this week, said it expected that an RBNZ endorsement of about 50 basis points of easing would put the Kiwi under further selling pressure and move into a 0.6810-50 range initially until the CPI's release in mid-July.  </p>
<p>The Trade Weighted Index (TWI) pulled up from its Tuesday lows to nudge 67.20 in early trade, compared with a Tuesday close of 67.10.</p>
