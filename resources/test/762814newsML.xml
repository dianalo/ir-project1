<p>Hong Kong on Tuesday reported a strong increase in exports in June this year but economists described the improvement as modest given the low base of comparison last year.</p>
<p>Total exports rose 9.4 percent over a year ago to HK$119.0 billion, while imports fell to HK$131.7 billion, for a monthly trade deficit of HK$12.7 billion.</p>
<p>Within total exports, the value of re-exports -- goods shipped through Hong Kong for processing elsewhere, usually China -- increased by 10 percent year-on-year to HK$101.1 billion. Domestic exports increased by 5.9 percent to HK$17.9 billion.</p>
<p>"Exports showed a notably better performance in June," the government said in a statement.</p>
<p>"In particular, re-exports registered a markedly accelerated growth from the average increase of 3.3 percent recorded in the first five months of 1997."</p>
<p>Eddie Wong, economist at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett Asia, agreed.</p>
<p>"The substantial turnaround in exports is partly because of a low base of comparison but trade is clearly recovering. If we look at the quarterly figures, export figures are picking up," he said.</p>
<p>But Ian Perkin, a trade expert and chief economist at the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said some improvement was inevitable, given a 26-percent increase in Chinese exports so far this year.</p>
<p>"With that sort of growth you'd expect a little bit of extra flow through Hong Kong," Perkin said.</p>
<p>Figures for the past six months of the year -- which reveal a 3.3 percent increase in re-exports -- are more revealing than one month's figures in isolation, Perkin said.</p>
<p>"Six months' growth has been still very modest by Hong Kong standards, whether you take re-exports, domestic exports or total exports," he said.</p>
<p>Economists cautioned on Monday that expectations for external trade had been too optimistic, partly because growth in Europe and Japan had been slower than anticipated.</p>
<p>But Perkin believes Hong Kong is experiencing a decline in trade flows as ports along the Chinese coast develop.</p>
<p>"It seems to me the first thing we have to remember is China exports a lot more stuff than we see," Perkin said. "With the extension of other ports as far north to Shanghai, it makes more sense to ship from other ports than truck it down to Hong Kong."</p>
