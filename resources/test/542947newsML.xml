<p>The Phoenix Coyotes will play Tuesday's seventh and deciding game of their Western Conference quarter-final series against the Anaheim Mighty Ducks without All-Star centre Jeremy Roenick.</p>
<p>Roenick suffered a third degree medial collateral tear of his left knee in Saturday's loss to Anaheim that will put him out of action for 4-6 weeks, the Coyotes announced Monday.</p>
<p>That means even if Phoenix wins in Anaheim Tuesday, the Coyotes will be without Roenick's services for the second round of the playoffs and likely even the conference finals, if Phoenix gets that far.</p>
<p>Roenick, the team's second-leading scorer in the playoffs, injured his left knee when he collided knee-to-knee with Anaheim's Ted Drury in the second period of in Sunday's 3-2 overtime loss. He went down immediately after the collision and had to be helped to the locker room.</p>
<p>"With J.R. out, we're all going to have to dig a little deeper and come up with a different game plan and play together as a team," said Coyotes right wing Mike Gartner.</p>
<p>Coyotes' officials accused Drury of deliberately trying to hurt Roenick.</p>
<p>"It's a perfect example of a guy going after one of our top players with no intent but to injure," charged general manager Bobby Smith.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old Roenick has two goals and four assists in six playoff games after collecting 29 goals and 40 assists in 72 games in his first season with the Coyotes.</p>
