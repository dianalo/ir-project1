<p>South Africans Ernie Els and Wayne Westner have agreed to defend the World Cup team title they won last year by a record 18 strokes, the organisers announced on Sunday.</p>
<p>The pair, playing before a home crowd at the Erinvale Golf Club last November, ended the domination of the annual event by the United States, for whom Fred Couples and Davis Love won four successive times from 1992 to 1995.</p>
<p>Els also won the individual title with a 16-under-par total of 272.</p>
<p>This year's event will be held from November 20-23 at Kiawah Island, South Carolina, on the Ocean Course where the 1991 Ryder Cup was played.</p>
<p>The organisers said other teams would be announced later and that Masters champion Tiger Woods would be invited to be part of the U.S. team.</p>
