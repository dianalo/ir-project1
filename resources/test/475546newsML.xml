<p>India captured two early wickets as West Indies made a disastrous start to their second innings on the third day of the third test on Sunday.</p>
<p>At tea, West Indies were 31 for two after their bowlers had fought back strongly earlier in the day taking the last seven wickets for just 70 runs to leave the match evenly balanced.</p>
<p>Trailing by 21 runs on the first innings, the home side made an awful start, losing Stuart Williams for a duck and first innings century maker Shivnarine Chanderpaul for three.</p>
<p>Williams was bowled off the inside edge by seamer Venkatesh Prasad and Chanderpaul was trapped leg before wicket by paceman Abey Kuruvilla.</p>
<p>Sherwin Campbell was unbeaten on 17 and captain Brian Lara was on seven at tea.</p>
<p>Earlier in the second session, India were dismissed for 319, losing their last four wickets for 29 runs.</p>
<p>In the third over after lunch, former captain Mohammad Azharuddin, who struggled for two hours in scoring 17, was caught by wicketkeeper Courtney Browne off fast bowler Franklyn Rose.</p>
<p>In the next over, Curtly Ambrose bowled Kuruvilla for nought to leave India on 296 for eight.</p>
<p>Rose wrapped up the innings to end with 4-77.</p>
<p>West Indies completely dominated the opening session taking three wickets as India managed only 41 runs.</p>
<p>Resuming at 249 for three, India lost the wickets of Saurav Ganguly (22), Rahul Dravid (78) and Nayan Mongia (one).</p>
<p>Dravid, who was bowled by fast bowler Ian Bishop, batted for six hours and 12 minutes, faced 243 balls and struck eight fours.</p>
