<p>The North Carolina House approved a proposal allowing Guilford and Forsyth counties to vote on a tax increase to fund a baseball stadium, the Winsont-Salem Journal said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The measure passed 66-40 Tuesday. House rules require a second vote before sending the proposal to the Senate, which previously passed a different version. Gov. Jim Hunt has said he would sign the bill.</p>
<p>It authorizes a May 5 referendum on a proposal to levy a one percent tax on restaurant meals in the two counties and a 50-cent surcharge on tickets for stadium events.</p>
<p>Revenues would be used to pay debt service on tax exempt 25-year bonds that would be issued to build the stadium on the Guilford-Forsyth county line.</p>
<p>Public funding for the $210 million facility would be capped at $140 million. An investment group headed by nursing home executive Don Beaver would put up another $70 million for the stadium and $150 million to buy a franchise.</p>
<p>The group hopes to win an expansion team in 1999 or buy an existing major league baseball team.</p>
