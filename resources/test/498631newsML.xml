<p>Norwegian industrial holding company Aker RGI ASA has bought around 24 million shares in Norway's largest insurer Storebrand ASA,according to a statement on the Oslo bourse on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Two million of the shares are ordinary stock, the statement said.</p>
<p>This puts Aker RGI's stake in Storebrand at six percent of the total capital, Frode Geitvik, Aker RGI spokesman, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Storebrand announced last week that it planned to merge with Norway's second largest commercial bank Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse ASA to form the country's largest financial group and the sixth biggest in the Nordic region.</p>
<p>Since then Norwegian billionaire entrepreneur Kjell Inge Roekke, the largest shareholder in Aker RGI, has increased his personal stake in Storebrand to 10 percent.</p>
<p>Geitvik declined to say if Aker RGI's acquisition was a financial or strategic investment.</p>
<p>"It is not so that we are not interested in the formation of the financial structure in Norway. It is naturally of significance to us. I must remind you that Aker earlier has been heavily positioned in Storebrand," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Daily newspaper Verdens Gang said Roekke, Aker RGI and Roekke's close ally Jens Heyerdahl in Norwegian food-based conglomerate Orkla together control 26 percent in Storebrand, which means they have the power to block the merger if they want to.</p>
<p>Storebrand's chairman Jon Gundersen has previously said that Aker RGI and Roekke should be considered as one shareholder, and therefore, under Norwegian regulations, should declare any shareholding over 10 percent.</p>
<p>Geitvik rejected this.</p>
<p>"Gundersen's reflections are his own opinion," the spokesman said. He added that Aker RGI had not take a position as to whether they supported the Storebrand/Christiania Bank merger or not.</p>
