<p>Brazil debt watchers this week will focus on Wednesday's planned Brady buyback and swap offer, but they may get an extra treat with the launch of the sovereign's long-awaited Eurolira bond.</p>
<p>"There is no particular reason to distance the lira bond (time-wise) from the swap because we are dealing with two different investors," said an official at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, which is lead managing the 500 billion lire, 20-year issue for Brazil.  </p>
<p>"We wouldn't want to launch it on the same day as the swap, but we could do it this week," the official added.</p>
<p>The lira deal, which has been in the works for months and would be Brazil's first 20-year Eurobond, was seen offering an 11 percent coupon, traders said.  </p>
<p>BRADY TRADING AHEAD OF THE SWAP DEADLINE shows more players will be swapping pars than discs or Cs  for the new 30-year global bond to be offered Tuesday. Holders of Bradies can exchange any of those three bonds for the global, or sell pars and discs back to the government for cash.</p>
<p>Pars offer the best swap value, according to fixed-income strategists. Cs, which are uncollateralized, are considered the least attractive swap.</p>
<p>"The asset choice definitely seems to be the pars," said a Brady bond trader in New York.  </p>
<p>But debt watchers say most investors, whether they own Bradies or not, are interested in purchasing the global bond outright. But cash purchases of the new bond will be limited to 25 percent of the total new issue.</p>
<p>Investors have until Tuesday to place bids for the global and results will be announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The size of the deal is expected to range from a minimum $1 billion to about $4 billion.</p>
<p>A NUMBER OF CORPORATE ISSUES are also in the pipeline, with banks dominating the new issues calendar.  </p>
<p>A $200 million two-tranche Eurobond deal from Banco Real is expected by July. (Corrects name of bank from Banco Bradesco to Banco Real) Lead manager WestMerchant Bank said in a statment that one of the tranches will carry a three-year maturity while the other will be a four-year deal.</p>
<p>WestMerchant also said it was leading a $40 million eight-year step-up bond, with puts and calls after three and five years, for Banco de Credito de Sao Paulo. Launch is expected in mid-June.  </p>
<p>Pricing for the deal, which is being co-led by Marcep Overseas Trust Ltd, is between 435 and 465 basis points over U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>Also, there is talk that Banco BMG will launch a $100 million eight-year bond through BankBoston, with puts and calls at three and five years. A road show was expected in mid-June.</p>
<p>BMG, a private bank in Minas Gerais state, has several Eurobond issues in the market.</p>
<p>In non-bank issues, industrial group Votorantim's $300 million eight-year bond, five-year put, is scheduled for June 9, syndicate sources said. The bond will be guaranteed by five companies in the group, including Votorantim Celulose e Papel.</p>
