<p>Hewlett-Packard Co. plans to cut prices on commercial desktop computers by as much as 24 percent, beginning next week, The New York Times said.</p>
<p>In Thursday's edition, the paper said the company is hoping to pre-empt a price-cutting announcement scheduled for Thursday by Compaq Computer.</p>
<p>The moves by Compaq and Hewlett-Packard are expected to be followed by similar cuts by IBM, the article said.</p>
<p>The three companies are trying to match lower prices offered by Dell Computer, which has been growing at a faster rate, the article said.</p>
<p>A Hewlett-Packard spokesman is quoted in the article as saying the cuts will not compromise the company's profitability.</p>
