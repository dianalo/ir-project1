<p>The White House said on Thursday that it would continue Middle East peace efforts, and it was up to the Israelis to resolve the corruption scandal involving Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>"We consider this a domestic legal matter that the Israeli government and the people of Israel have to resolve," White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said.</p>
<p>Netanyahu refused to quit on Thursday following the announcement by police that they had recommended he be tried for fraud and breach of trust.</p>
<p>Asked if the uproar would delay peace efforts, McCurry said: "I'm not going to speculate on that. We will remain committed to doing our best to press forward in the Middle East peace process."</p>
<p>U.S. analysts and commentators said, however, they believed the Israeli political scandal would delay U.S. attempts to get the peace process back on track.</p>
<p>"It will push them (U.S. mediators) into more of a wait-and-see approach," an analyst close to the administration said, as U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross held talks in the region with Israeli and Palestinian officials.</p>
<p>In an editorial, the New York Times said: "The political crisis can only complicate attempts to rescue the troubled peace with the Palestinians, which is nearer collapse now than at any time since the Oslo agreements were signed nearly four years ago."</p>
<p>"The necessary decisions for peace can only be made by an Israeli government whose own legitimacy remains above doubt," the newspaper said.</p>
