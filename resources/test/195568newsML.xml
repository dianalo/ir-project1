<p>A ferry carrying 950 passengers broke off a journey to Denmark and turned back to the Norwegian capital on Sunday after a bomb threat was made against the ship, police said.</p>
<p>A police spokesman said Stena Saga, which is owned by Swedish ferry company Stena Line, had left Oslo for Fredrikshavn on Saturday night when an anonymous telephone caller said a bomb had been placed on board.</p>
<p>"The captain decided to turn around in the Oslo Fjord and the ferry was back in port at 2 a.m. (0100 GMT)," he said. "All 950 passengers had to go ashore and we are now searching the ferry with bomb-sniffing dogs."</p>
