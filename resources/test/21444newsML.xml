<headline>Venezuelan police clash with union marchers.</headline>
<dateline>CARACAS, Venezuela 1996-08-29</dateline>

<p>About 50 Venezuelan police fired plastic bullets and tear gas on Thursday to disperse a small march by union workers, but no major injuries were reported, witnesses said.</p>
<p>It was the most violent incident in the capital since the government launched a tough economic program four months ago.</p>
<p>Police intervened when about 150 public sector workers, including firemen and health workers, blocked a main highway to protest delayed salary bonuses.</p>
<p>Witnesses said at least five protesters were slightly injured during the clashes which lasted about an hour.</p>
<p>The protest march followed a 24-hour work stoppage by about one million public sector workers on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Union leaders condemned the violence, the most serious since the government began an austerity program which has seen the annual inflation rate rocket to more than 112 percent.</p>
