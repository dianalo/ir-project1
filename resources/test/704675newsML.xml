<p>Slovenia's blue-chip SBI index jumped in early trade on Thursday, driven higher for the twelfth straight day by the central bank's more relaxed stance towards foreign investors.</p>
<p>"The index is not rising, it is virtually flying," one broker said.</p>
<p>Bur he cautioned that profit taking may soon clip the market's wings: "It would be normal to expect some profit-taking soon, maybe even today."</p>
<p>Dealers were unsure whether foreign buyers were behind the gains but they noted the local unit of Austria's Creditanstalt bank was particularly active. Nobody at the bank was immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>By 0900 GMT the SBI index was 29.42 points, or 2.04 percent, higher at 1,473.82. Earlier it touched an intra-day high of 1,502.36. -- Novica Mihajlovic, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
