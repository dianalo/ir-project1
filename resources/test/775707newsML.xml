<p>Malaysian shipping and transport firm Konsortium Perkapalan Bhd said on Monday it expected air cargo to contribute around 33 percent of group turnover by the year 2001.</p>
<p>"I expect the air cargo side to provide around a third of the contribution to turnover by 2001," group executive chairman Mirzan Mahathir told a news conference.</p>
<p>Mirzan said air cargo's current contribution to group turnover was "not significant."</p>
<p>Mirzan was speaking after the launch of CEN Worldwide Sdn Bhd, a 20-percent owned express cargo firm.</p>
<p>Konsortium's turnover for the year to December 31, 1996 stood at 454.67 million ringgit, against 100.79 million ringgit the previous year.</p>
<p>CEN's other partners are postal utility Pos Malaysia Bhd, which owns 42.5 percent of the equity, while Transmile Group Bhd holds 37.5 percent.</p>
<p>Mirzan is also chairman of Transmile, and is the eldest son of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.</p>
<p>"CEN Worldwide Sdn Bhd will be providing express transport services including door-to-door deliveries, express freight handling, warehousing, logistic technologies and management expertise in these areas," said a CEN statement.</p>
