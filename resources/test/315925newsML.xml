<p>European grain traders on Friday pegged recent sales of 1.5 million tonnes of Australian wheat to Iran in the low $150s per tonne, Fob.</p>
<p>They said  Australia was best placed to grab further business with Iran this year as it enjoyed a quality advantage over other exporters, notably the European Union.</p>
<p>Exporters cited selling prices ranging from $149 to $155 per tonne, Fob.</p>
<p>One exporter said an average level of $150 per tonne was "attractive but still correct" as it was in line with world market prices.</p>
<p>The salem, clinched during the past week, made Iran Australia's largest customer, bringing to 2.5 million tonnes exports to Iran in 1996/97, the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said earlier.</p>
<p>AWB chairman Trevor Flugge did not disclose the price of the sale but said it was about the same level as a recent sale to Pakistan.</p>
<p>Australia this week sold 112,000 tonnes of Australian Standard White to Pakistan at $156.28 Fob.</p>
<p>"It is a very good price (for the sale to Iran) and we're very very comfortable with it," Flugge said</p>
<p>Traders said Australian wheat was meeting the quality standards sought by Iran, and that EU wheat might be shut out of future deals.</p>
<p>"Iran does not like EU wheat. It thinks its moisture content is too high. They buy EU wheat if they have nothing else," one exporter said.</p>
<p>Exporters also expect Argentina and Canada, which have already sold wheat to Iran during the current season, to continue competing with Australia for business.</p>
