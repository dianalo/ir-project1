<p>A group including U.S.-based BellSouth Corp won bidding on a concession to operate cellular services in six northeastern Brazilian states with an offer of 555.6 million reais, an official said.  </p>
<p>A Communications Ministry official said the bid by BCE SA group, which also includes Brazil's Banco Safra, media group Estado de Sao Paulo and telecoms equipment maker Splice, was 142 percent over the 230 million-real base price for the 15-year concession.</p>
<p>The B Band concession area No. 10 comprises the poor, rural northeastern states of Alagoas, Ceara, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Piaui and Rio Grande do Norte.</p>
<p>It was the second cellular license to be auctioned Friday and the fifth so far in the Brazilian government's B Band privatization program.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, a group including Sweden's Telia won bidding on a concession to operate B Band services in an area covering non-metropolitan Sao Paulo state.</p>
<p>The Tess group bid 1.326 billion reais, more than double the base price, for the area No. 2 license.</p>
