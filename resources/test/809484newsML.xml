<p>Improving consumer confidence and low interest rates will push Ontario's economy ahead of all other Canadian provinces in 1997, but a dip in consumer spending will lead to slower growth in 1998, a forecast issued on Tuesday by a private research institute said.</p>
<p>A solid rebound in real consumer spending and strength in the auto sector will help Ontario post growth of 4.3 percent in 1997 and 2.7 percent in 1998, the Conference Board of Canada said in its quarterly provincial outlook.</p>
<p>"Ontario will shine with projected growth of 4.3 percent this year as stronger consumer spending and continued gains in export-oriented industries propel economic activity," said Luc Bussiere, the board's associate director of economic services.</p>
<p>Alberta will be close behind with growth of 4.0 percent in 1997 and 2.8 percent in 1998 in part because of a surge in oil and gas drilling and expansion of the province's oil sands production, the board said.</p>
<p>"Energy-related investment projects will underpin another year of rapid expansion in Alberta," Bussiere added.</p>
<p>Prince Edward Island will record the smallest growth rates during the next two years, the board said.</p>
<p>The Atlantic province's economy will grow by 0.1 percent in 1997 and 1.7 percent in 1998, the board said.</p>
<p>Overall, Canada's economy will grow by 3.1 percent in 1997 and 2.8 percent in 1998, the board said.</p>
<p>The board said an inability by consumers to sustain their high spending pace next year would be the main cause of the slowdown.</p>
