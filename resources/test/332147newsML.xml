<p>Polish brewer Okocim SA jumped 10 percent to 20.9 zlotys in the session's top 14.4-million-zloty turnover on plans to launch an new product and in delayed reaction to its strong 1996 results, analysts said.</p>
<p>"It showed very good earnings for December and for the whole of 1996, which definitely had some effect," one analyst said.</p>
<p>Okocim reported last Friday a net profit of 1.5 million zlotys in December and 27.1 million zlotys in the whole 1996 but analysts said new foreign investors might have needed more time to digest the data than Warsaw markets veterans.</p>
<p>Traders also said the surge might have been helped by a newspaper report on Okocim's plans to launch in mid-February a new type of beer, which it hoped to become a big seller.</p>
<p>The article in the Parkiet financial daily also reminded investors that Okocim, 33-percent-owned by Carlsberg would start brewing beer under the Danish brand, they said.</p>
