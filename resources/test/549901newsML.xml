<p>Wives of African leaders will gather in Nigeria next week to discuss how they can use their influence to bring peace to the war-ravaged continent, Nigeria's foreign minister said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tom Ikimi told assembled African ambassadors in Abuja that the three-day meeting, with the backing of Nigeria's military government, would begin on Monday in the Nigerian capital.</p>
<p>"The major objective of the summit is to find ways women can be involved in conflict resolution in Africa," Ikimi said.</p>
<p>He said 30 African first ladies would attend the forum in person while 10 countries would send delegates. Representatives of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and United Nations are also expected to take part.</p>
<p>"The summit will adopt a declaration for peace and promote the empowerment of women in the peaceful resolution of conflicts in Africa," Ikimi said.</p>
<p>African presidents have so far failed to resolve over a dozen conflicts raging in the world's poorest continent.</p>
<p>Ikimi said the envisaged declaration was aimed at complementing the efforts of the OAU to resolve conflicts.</p>
<p>He did not say whether wives of any of the protagonists of Africa's ferocious war in Zaire would be coming.</p>
<p>The summit is the brainchild of Maryam Abacha, the wife of Nigerian strongman General Sani Abacha, who has been shunned by many countries in the world for his human rights record.</p>
<p>Nigeria is engaged in a border dispute with Cameroon over the oil-rich Bakassi peninsula. The row has occasionally flared into violence and troops from both sides have repeatedly clashed since 1992.</p>
<p>Nigeria is also the biggest contributor to the West African ECOMOG force trying to bring peace to Liberia.</p>
