<p>Malaysia's tin price is expected to fall 1.3 percent to an average of 15.20 ringgit ($6.08) a kg next year from the 15.40 ringgit forecast this year, the Finance Ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>Tin prices averaged 15.33 ringgit a kg in 1995.</p>
<p>Tin output is expected to fall 1.6 percent to 6,200 tonnes in 1997, the ministry said in its annual Economic Report.</p>
<p>It said a 1.6 percent dip in production to 6,300 tonnes was also forecast this year, leaving Malaysia -- once the biggest producer -- sixth in the world.</p>
<p>Export earnings from tin are expected to increase marginally by 0.5 percent to 547.6 million ringgit in 1996 over the previous year due to favourable prices, boosted by improved global demand and lower stocks, the report said.</p>
<p>During the first six months of the year, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands and South Korea emerged as the main buyers of Malaysian tin, with combined purchases of 10,646 tonnes, or 60.3 percent of the total produced.</p>
