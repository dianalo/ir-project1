<p>The dollar is expected to trade around the middle of the 110 to 120 yen range over the next three months, before edging lower by the end of the year, economists predicted in a Reuters poll released on Thursday.</p>
<p>Forecasts from 32 economists in Tokyo and London produced a mean average for the dollar level of 114.74 yen at the end of September and 113.92 yen at the end of December.</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 116 yen in early afternoon trade in Tokyo on Thursday.</p>
<p>The survey was conducted from July 7 to July 9.</p>
<p>Economists said, however, that the yen could overshoot against the dollar over the summer due to Japan's ballooning trade surplus.</p>
<p>"The break-even point for Japanese exporters is currently around 106 yen, implying that they can still post profits at the current dollar/yen level. As a result, Japan's trade surplus could continue to expand, putting upward pressure on the yen," said Mikihiro Matsuoka, a senior economist at Daiwa Institute of Research.</p>
<p>Japan's custom-cleared trade surplus in June rose 27.7 percent year-on-year to 934.21 billion yen, Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The so-called 'J-curve effect' could boost the value of Japanese exports and keep the trade surplus at a very high level in the July-September period. That could result in a yen overshoot this summer," said Takao Hattori, an economist at Dai-Ichi Research and Management Institute.</p>
<p>Hattori predicted a dollar rate of 110 yen at the end of September and 108 yen at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Not all economists predicted a weaker dollar, however.</p>
<p>Koji Ono, deputy general manager of the economic research and investment information departments at Kankaku Research Institute, said growth in Japan's trade surplus was unlikely to continue at the current pace.</p>
<p>"Strong growth in auto exports to the United States was behind the recent surge in Japan's trade surplus. Growth in Japanese car exports could stagnate in coming months, however, as the U.S. auto market may head into a period of contraction," Ono said.</p>
<p>An expected increase next year in production capacity at Japanese manufacturers' overseas plants could also check the rise in Japan's trade surplus over a longer period, Ono added.</p>
<p>Kankaku's forecasts pegged the dollar at 115 yen at the end of September and 120 yen at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Economists also said the interest rate differential between Japan and the United States could favour the yen.</p>
<p>"The U.S. economy is expected to slow down. Prices are also stable in the United States, so the U.S. Federal Reserve may be able to avoid a credit tightening," Daiwa's Matsuoka said.</p>
<p>Even if the Fed raises interest rates, that is only likely to provide a temporary boost for the dollar, as it is unlikely to be followed by successive increases, he added.</p>
<p>"The U.S. economy is already starting to slow down. We don't expect another Fed tightening. There may even be room for the Fed to lower interest rates next year," said Dai-Ichi's Hattori.</p>
<p>"Meanwhile, Japan could raise interest rates in the October-December quarter, so a narrower interest rate differential could encourage yen buying," he added.</p>
