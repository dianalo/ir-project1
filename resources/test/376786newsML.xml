<p>Finnish wholesaler and retailer Kesko Oy said on Thursday it expected sales to increase around four percent this year and that its aim was to retain good profitability.</p>
<p>"Our sales are expected to increase by about four percent in 1997, and the aim is to retain a good profit level," Kesko said in a statement with its 1996 results.  </p>
<p>Kesko reported a 740 million markka profit before extraordinaries and tax compared to 689 million in 1995.</p>
<p>Net sales increased by 11 percent to 29.3 billion markka.</p>
<p>Kesko said it was -- even without Tuko's daily goods operations -- a big company for Finland and that it would look for growth overseas.</p>
<p>"We are looking towards Russia and the Baltics," CEO Eero Kinnunen said, but did not give any details.</p>
<p>Kesko also said it would continue to expand its hardware and shoe retailing operations in Sweden. @</p>
<p>Kesko said the acquisition of trading house  Kaukomarkkinat last spring was supporting its overseas expansion.</p>
