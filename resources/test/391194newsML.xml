<headline>American says pilots dispute jeopardizes Boeing megadeal.</headline>

<p>American Airlines said Thursday the carrier's bitter contract dispute with pilots means it will not be able to take delivery of some Boeing Co. jets next year as scheduled under a $6.5 billion contract.</p>
<p>Donald Carty, president of the AMR Corp. unit, also warned that the Boeing deal could be scrapped if the contract settlement proves too expensive.</p>
<p>"There will be some airplanes we expected to take in 1998 that we will not now be able to take," Carty told reporters.</p>
<p>He said the entire contract for the delivery of 103 jets between 1998 and 2002 depends on a successful resolution, from the company's perspective, of the contract dispute.</p>
<p>"We will not be doing anything until we know what the terms of the long-term agreement will be," Carty said. The airline cannot afford to give up any more than already offered at the negotiating table, he said.</p>
<p>"We have already upped the ante, and we don't have many more places to go," Carty said.</p>
<p>He said American officials are talking with Boeing about how to reschedule delivery of the aircraft once the pilots contract is signed.</p>
<p>Earlier Thursday, the leader of a local branch of the union representing American Airlines pilots was quoted as criticising the union's handling of bitter contract negotiations with management.</p>
<p>Jay Courtney, chairman of the union's Dallas-Fort Worth area branch, said he believed an agreement could have been reached in negotiations last week and called on national leaders to give rank-and-file members another vote before authorising a possible strike in mid-April.</p>
<p>"The membership is crying out that they'd like to have another strike ballot," Courtney told The Dallas Morning News. "It is unfortunate that in the midst of all this, we cannot survey our pilots."</p>
<p>Courtney is one of the Allied Pilots Association's key local leaders. The Dallas-Fort Worth base has 2,800 pilots, about 30 percent of the union's nationwide membership.</p>
<p>Union leaders are resisting calls from some pilots for a strike vote. National President James Sovich attended a meeting of 650 pilots in Dallas on Wednesday but was less optimistic than Courtney on the chances of reaching a deal with the airline on a contract.</p>
<p>Sovich said a mid-April strike was "more probable than not" and that the two sides were still very far apart, especially on the issue of how to deploy a new breed of 50-seat and 70-seat regional jets.</p>
<p>American wants to give the jets to its low-cost commuter carrier American Eagle, which employs pilots from another union. But the Allied Pilots union accuses management of trying to "outsource" its members' jobs and insists that only American Airlines pilots be allowed to fly the jets.</p>
<p>American's 9,300 pilots went on strike at midnight last Friday but President Bill Clinton intervened minutes later, appointing a presidential board to help resolve the dispute.</p>
<p>The move forced the pilots to return to work and pushed back any strike by 60 days. Both sides are to put their case before the presidential board starting next week.</p>
<p>Sovich said the union was sticking to its demands on wages and regional jets, and that he firmly opposed any new strike ballot. Initial rank-and-file support for the first strike came with a January vote in which pilots rejected a tentative contract agreement by a 61-39 margin.</p>
<p>AMR's stock fell 50 cents to $81.75, while Boeing slid $2.125 to $107.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
