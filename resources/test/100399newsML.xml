<p>The strike at General Motors Corp.'s Canadian operations began to take its toll on the automaker's U.S. factories on Monday forcing GM to idle at least 1,850 engine and transmission workers.</p>
<p>GM Powertrain Division spokeswoman Christine D'Angela said the automaker already has idled 1,050 workers at the automaker's North Tonawanda, N.Y., engine plant who build 3.1-litre V-6 engines.</p>
<p>GM also on Monday will notify about 800 workers at its Ypsilanti, Mich., transmission plant not to report to work on Tuesday, D'Angela said.</p>
<p>In both cases, the facilities are only partially affected. North Tonawanda has a total of 4,216 hourly workers, while Ypsilanti has 5,692.</p>
<p>Both plants have been affected by the halt of production of GM's popular Chevrolet Lumina sedans at the company's strikebound Oshawa, Ontario assembly complex. The Lumina uses North Tonawanda's 3.1-litre V-6 and front-drive transmissions produced at Ypsilanti.</p>
<p>GM spokesman Gerry Holmes said the automaker also has cancelled all overtime production in North America this week in order to conserve parts that may be in short supply.</p>
<p>As Monday began, about 5,690 workers at GM's St. Catharines, Ontario components plants went on strike, marking the second major step in the Canadian Auto Workers union's escalating strike strategy against the automaker.</p>
<p>The St. Catharines plants supply a broad range of components to U.S. models, including V-8 engines, suspension and axle components.</p>
<p>The rest of GM Canada's operations are expected to be on strike by midnight on Wednesday.</p>
