<p>Crown Cork &amp; Seal Co Inc said on Tuesday that it would close six manufacturing locations in the United States, generating an after-tax charge of $0.31 per share to third quarter earnings.</p>
<p>The charge, estimated at $43.3 million, also covers other restructuring activities, primarily in Europe, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Crown said the plants slated for closure belong to its Constar subsidiary and that the move was aimed at improving its plastic beverage container business.</p>
<p>"Annual savings relating to all of these actions, when fully implemented, are expected to be approximately $20 million, or $0.14 per share on a fully diluted bases," the packaging products company said.</p>
