<p>Inco Ltd and the union representing locked out workers at the company's Manitoba facility said on Wednesday they would resume negotiations on Thursday.</p>
<p>"We're going back to the bargaining table tomorrow at 10 a.m. (1100 EDT/1500 GMT)," said Bob Desjarlais, president of local 6166 of the United Steelworkers of America.</p>
<p>Almost 1,400 workers have been locked out of the nickel facility for more than a week after rejecting a contract offer from Inco. The facility produces about 100 million pounds of nickel a year or about 20 percent of Inco's total output.  </p>
<p>The main stumbling blocks to a settlement have been shift scheduling and wages.</p>
<p>"It became clear that both sides wanted to get back to the table," Inco spokesman Dan McSweeney said. "We saw an opportunity for the talks to be fruitful."</p>
<p>The two sides had refused to meet because they said they were too far apart on the main issues.</p>
<p>But there were now signs of flexibility from both parties, said Desjarlais.</p>
<p>"Both sides realize the only way we can resolve this is by movement from both sides," he said.</p>
