<p>The year is 2003, the fifth year of monetary union, and the European single currency bloc is in crisis amid global recession and soaring unemployment.</p>
<p>This is the scenario envisaged in a report by a co-director at the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation (CSFI), a London thinktank.</p>
<p>David Lascelles, author of the report, examined ways in which European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) could go awry, which he said had 20-30 percent chance of happening.</p>
<p>Lascelles said it was imperative economic convergence among EMU members be far-enough advanced because the common currency will need to ride through economic cycles and periods of social turbulence.</p>
<p>"EMU must be strong enough to withstand that sort of thing," he said.</p>
<p>Lascelles writes from the perspective of a fictional Parliamentary report on the history of EMU for the then British Prime Minister -- Labour leader Tony Blair -- in 2003.</p>
<p>Looking back from this point in time, the report says that in the dash to EMU, high levels of unemployment and lack of labour market flexibility and mobility were largely ignored by government planners. These were "timebombs waiting to explode", the report says.</p>
<p>Specifically, Lascelles sees a situation where EMU begins to crumble because Maastricht criteria, particularly on total public debt and fiscal deficits, were also not strictly adhered to by member states, including Germany and France.</p>
<p>"EMU was driven by political imperatives which ignored the full practical implications, and in the end, those imperatives were not sufficiently powerful to see it through economic problems that were evident from the outset," the fictional report says.</p>
<p>The planned "stability pact" to ensure fiscal discipline under the euro currency plays a crucial role in Lascelles' hypothetical demise of EMU.</p>
<p>The report posits that authorities, during the run-up to EMU, did not understand how the stability pact "could actually exacerbate economic problems in EMU...risking a downward spiral with no hope of a bail-out".</p>
<p>The stability pact, as Lascelles envisions it, would tie governments' hands from using fiscal policy to combat recession without providing offsetting transfers from Brussels.</p>
<p>Social upheaval -- including anti-EU riots in France -- and rising economic nationalism ensue and ultimately force France, Italy and Spain to withdraw from the common currency.</p>
<p>The political and economic fallout could even throw the future of the European Union into question, the report said.</p>
<p>"There is the prospect of a sharp increase in inflation in the departing states, and further political unrest as governments are forced to take firm measures to recover economic control."</p>
