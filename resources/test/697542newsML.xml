<p>*Australian bonds push into firmer territory through the afternoon as market remains optimnistic on chances of a rate cut following this week's RBA board meeting.</p>
<p>*Analysts say market vulnerable to pullback if rates steady.  </p>
<p>Australian bonds posted some afternoon gains to finish in positive territory as the market remained buoyed on the prospect of a local rate cut following this week's Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) board meeting.</p>
<p>Bonds had been flat to firmer through a thin morning session, but afternoon buying took bonds higher but trade remained thin. While firmer, bonds remain below the levels of earlier this month when a rate cut was aggressively factored in.</p>
<p>Economists see the prospect of a rate cut during July as a better than even chance, although much will depend on the outcome of the U.S. FOMC meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Robertson said the market had moved to factor in a cut aggressively on the back of two figures reported earlier this month - a 1.7 percent fall in April retail trade and a 40,300 fall in May employment.</p>
<p>"The market is clearly vulnerable to the RBA being less profoundly affected by these data and remaining on hold this week," he said, and others agreed.</p>
<p>"The key risk to the market will be if the RBA holds off reducing rates to assess the key price and activity data released over the month of July," Societe Generale economist Glenn Maguire said.</p>
