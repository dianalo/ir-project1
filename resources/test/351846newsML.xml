<p>LecTec Corp said Monday the full national rollout of the TheraPatch analgesic patch is scheduled for completion in the third quarter through an exclusive retail marketing and distribution program with CNS Inc.</p>
<p>By the end of the quater, most major national drug chains and large wholesale distributors are expected to be carrying TheraPatch, LecTec said. As a result, TheraPatch sales are expected to increase steadily in the second half.  </p>
<p>LecTec said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) clearance last fall of an investigational new drug application for its cotinine-based smoking cessation pill has heightened interest in this product among potential co-development and marketing partners.</p>
<p>Additional rounds of discussions with several major pharmaceutical companies are scheduled for the third quarter.</p>
<p>Earlier, LecTec reported a net loss for the second quarter ended December 31 of $264,000 or $.07 a share, an improvement from a year-ago net loss of $664,000 or $0.17 a share. Second quarter sales declined to $3,028,000 from $3,255,000.  </p>
<p>The lower second quarter sales was due to the absence of the direct marketing sales of the former Natus Corp subsidiary, which was sold in December 1995. The drop in the new loss was due to the elimination of the substantial operating losses and expenses associated with the Natus.</p>
<p>Rodney Young, chief executive officer, said in a statement that he was encouraged by the progress made during the first half of fiscal 1997 to stabilize the company's core conductive products and medical tape businesses. He said strengthening these operations makes him optimistic about the outlook for the core businesses in the second half of fiscal 1997.</p>
<p>Young added that the overall pace of recovery over the near-term will continue to be affected by restructuring initiatives, and by investments in resarch and development and sales and marketing.</p>
<p>LecTec is a medical company that develops, manufactures and markets products based on its advanced skin-interface technologies.</p>
