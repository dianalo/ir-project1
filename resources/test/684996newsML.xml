<p>Indonesia on Tuesday pledged to continue reducing trade barriers, but defended its policy of market intervention in the food sector, saying it was needed to stabilise prices.</p>
<p>"...To deny the reality that there are legitimate instances for government support and intervention seems to me foolhardy," Beddu Amang, chairman of state commodities regulator BULOG, told an international conference on food in Jakarta.</p>
<p>"Why should we care about price instability? The most important reason is that it protects both poor consumers and poor farmers from extreme hardship," he said.</p>
<p>He said poor people can, for instance, be severely disadvantaged by even temporarily high prices while poor farmers can be severely hurt by exceptionally low prices.</p>
<p>"It is much more cost-effective to stabilise prices in a market-friendly way so that the price fluctuations are prevented in the first place," he said.</p>
<p>BULOG has an import monoploy on certain commodities considered strategically important such as rice and sugar, and intervenes in the market by boosting supply through imports when cooking oil prices are considered by it to be high.</p>
<p>The agency has often been criticised by analysts for not wanting to relinquish its role and let market forces determine the prices of the commodities it has authority over.</p>
<p>Amang said price stabilisation created a more predictable environment in which farmers can make investment decisions.</p>
<p>He said if farmers were convinced they would be protected from periods of low prices, they would be encouraged to invest more to increase production.</p>
<p>Amang said price interventions by BULOG were not protectionist in nature. "While we have shielded our economy from much of the instability on the world rice market, we have not systematically protected either producers or consumers.</p>
<p>"Instead, we have stabilised domestic prices around the long-term trend of world prices," he said.</p>
