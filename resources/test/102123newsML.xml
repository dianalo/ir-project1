<p>Poland's government approved a costly long-term plan on Tuesday to better manage the site and surroundings of the former death camp at Auschwitz, where World War Two Nazi German invaders murdered up to 1.5 million people.</p>
<p>Cabinet chief-of-staff Leszek Miller told a news conference the scheme aimed at "ensuring fitting reverence for the place of the mass extermination of Jews and the martyrdom of the Polish and other nations."</p>
<p>The government began drafting the plan earlier this year following an international row over efforts by a local developer in the southern town of Oswiecim to open a shopping centre opposite the main gate of the former camp, now a museum.</p>
<p>Jewish and other critics said the shop project was highly inappropriate so close to the major site of the wartime Holocaust -- especially as the scattered ashes of the dead mean the twin Auschwitz-Birkenau death camps remain a vast cemetery.</p>
<p>Building permission has been withdrawn from the developer who has said he plans to seek compensation or sell the site to the authorities for use in providing catering and other services which could then be moved out of the museum itself.</p>
<p>Miller said a first stage of the scheme from next year until 2001, would cost almost 56 million zlotys ($20.7 million), 37 million ($13.7 million) of which would be for tidying and administering a protected zone around the site.</p>
<p>Inappropriate development would be prevented or removed in the camp's immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>The remaining 18 million ($6.6 million) will go to modernisation of transport facilities in Oswiecim, partly to remove public routes passing close to the former camp.</p>
<p>Miller said authorities would consult on the plan's implementation with interested parties in Poland and abroad and a special plenipotentiary and council would be appointed to oversee it.</p>
<p>It would be backed by legislation, to be passed quickly, safeguarding the site. This would also guard against any repetition of a demonstration held there earlier this year by a small group of extreme right-wingers.</p>
<p>Funds are to come from local authorities who launched the project, from central government -- which will provide nine million zlotys ($3.3 million) from the budget next year -- and from voluntary contributions including gifts from abroad.</p>
<p>A later stage of the project, to the year 2007, will involve construction of a major congress and discussion centre in Oswiecim and a facelift for the delapidated town, which has suffered from its proximity to the camp whose name it shares.</p>
<p>The government strategic plan for Auschwitz fits in with wider Polish efforts to end years of controversy with Jewish organisations over the proper treatment of Auschwitz and other issues from the past, so as to launch a new era in relations.</p>
<p>The vast majority of those killed at the camp were Jews brought there from around Europe, including many thousands of children, while tens of thousands of Polish patriots as well as many Russians and others also died there.</p>
<p>Jewish commentators have objected to actions which diminish the former camp's significance as a memorial or might obscure the Jewish identity of most of the victims, including the opening of a Catholic convent, since moved, next to the site.</p>
<p>Last year Poland marked the 50th anniversary of the camp's liberation with ecumenical rather than primarily Jewish ceremonies, leading Jews to hold a separate commemoration.</p>
