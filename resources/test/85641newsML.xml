<p>America Online Inc., the world's No.1 online service, launched a $100 million-plus marketing campaign Monday that includes a prime-time TV ad campaign set to the music from "The Jetsons" cartoon.</p>
<p>The ad campaign, beginning Monday evening, was just one part of America Online's revamp into a new AOL, Chairman Steve Case told reporters in a conference call.</p>
<p>"We want to show how AOL is different," Case said. "It really is the Internet and a whole lot more."</p>
<p>AOL and other online services that followed the older, closed, proprietary model have been moving closer to the wide-open Internet rather than be overwhelmed by it.</p>
<p>The Dulles, Va.-based online service provider will spend more than $100 million this quarter on the marketing campaign, Case said.</p>
<p>The ads will be set to the familiar theme music from "The Jetsons," the cartoon classic about a future family. A 60-second spot follows a family through its daily routine, highlighting family members' individual uses of technology from digital satellite televisions to cellular phones and online services.</p>
<p>A series of 30-second spots will focus on individual family members using various AOL features geared to age groups.</p>
<p>The campaign is aimed at personal computer owners who are not AOL members and at AOL's membership of more than 6.2 million people.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, America Online shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange. At the same time, it launched a revamp of its service with a new version of its software, more customer support, a focus on retaining customers and an initiative to gain new members.</p>
<p>Case said AOL has "been in a period of rethinking, refocusing and seeing where consumer preferences are shifting."</p>
<p>AOL plans to continue spending heavily on marketing. The company will continue mailing out floppy disks containing its software but intends to go beyond that. In addition to the prime-time ads, the service will develop a half-hour commercial and a videocassette.</p>
<p>"If each member of the AOL team could go personally to our customers and just spend half an hour with them and show them features of the service, they would be in love with AOL forever," Case told reporters.</p>
<p>He also said AOL is on target to reach 10 million members next summer. "We think word-of-mouth is going to be very strong," the AOL chief said.</p>
<p>Case said AOL will hit its membership target by doing a better job than its rivals and because, as a service, it is a better interactive experience and has greatly improved its Internet access and feel.</p>
<p>He cited marketing deals with software giant Microsoft Corp. and Web browser leader Netscape Communications Corp.</p>
<p>America Online stock rose 75 cents to $35.50 on the NYSE Monday.</p>
