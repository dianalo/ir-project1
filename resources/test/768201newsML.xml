<p>New York Health Care Inc, a licensed home health care agency, said Thursday that after completing its due diligence it has terminated its previously-announced letter of intent to acquire a leading Florida home health agency.</p>
<p>The company said, however, that it will continue to pursue acquisitions, principally in metropolitan New York City and the southeast U.S., although there can be no assurances that such acquisitions will be consummated.</p>
<p>New York Health Care is engaged primarily in supplying services of paraprofessionals who provide a broad range of health care support services to patients in their homes.</p>
