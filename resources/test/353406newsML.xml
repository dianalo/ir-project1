<p>European champions Juventus will field a top strength side for their European Super Cup final tie against Paris St Germain on Wednesday despite their 6-1 lead from the first leg.</p>
<p>The Turin club aim to do justice to the fixture in Palermo, where ticket touts have been having a bonanza with a match which gives soccer-mad Sicily a rare chance to see international club soccer.</p>
<p>Organisers believe they could have sold double the 37,500 all-seater capacity of Palermo's La Favorita stadium.</p>
<p>Juventus opted to play the second leg in Sicily because they feared a poor turn out in their home town Turin, given the huge lead the side takes into the second leg of the annual contest between the European Cup and Cup Winners' Cup holders.</p>
<p>Juventus, currently two points clear of Sampdoria at the top of Serie A, go into the game in bouyant mood, while PSG are struggling with poor form and injuries.</p>
<p>Juventus have French midfielder Didier Deschamps suspended and Portuguese defender Manuel Dimas cuptied.</p>
<p>Alessandro Del Piero and Michele Padovano lead their attack while Yugoslav Vladimir Jugovic, Frenchman Zinedine Zidane and Alessio Tacchinardi line out in midfield.</p>
<p>The visitors come into the game without a home league win since November and seven points adrift of league leaders Monaco, following a 1-1 draw with Cannes on Saturday.</p>
<p>PSG's prospects were further weakend by a serious knee injury suffered by experienced central defender Alain Roche last Saturday. He will be out for the rest of the season and will be replaced on Wednesday by Didier Domi.</p>
<p>"The match against Juventus will be a tough one, but we must not be afraid. We must play with pride", said Domi.</p>
<p>Probable teams:</p>
<p>Juventus - Angelo Peruzzi; Moreno Torricelli, Ciro Ferrara, Paolo Montero, Gianluca Pessotto; Angelo Di Livio, Zinedine Zidane, Alessio Tacchinardi, Vladimir Jugovic; Michele Padovano, Alessandro Del Piero.</p>
<p>PSG - Bernard Lama; Jimmy Algerino, Didier Domi, Paul Le Guen, Daniel Kennedy; Jerome Leroy, Vincent Guerin, Benoit Cauet, Leonardo; Patrice Loko, Cyrille Pouget.</p>
