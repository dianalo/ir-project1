<p>A study of 43 energy utility mergers over a 10-year period found the deals were profitable for acquiring company shareholders less than half the time.</p>
<p>The Mercer Management Consulting group examined 43 completed between 1985 and 1995.  Shareholder returns at six- month, one-year, two-year and three-year intervals found only 12 of the 33 acquiring utilities continued to outperform the industry in terms of both revenue and operating profit.</p>
<p>"Acquisitions are a risky way to grow their firms," said Andy Patterson, the study's author. "And particularly for utilities."  </p>
<p>"Utilities are an industry that tends to imitate, not innovate.  Pulling off the deals requires a lot of competencies" not usually found in previously-protected industries, Patterson said.</p>
<p>The successful mergers shared several characteristics, Patterson said.  Smaller deals, for under $500 million, were more successful, as strategic intent was often clearer and post-merger implementation were more manageable, the study found.  </p>
<p>"When you have two totally intergrated utilities trying to merge, you have everybody smashing the thing together," Patterson said.  "When you have a smaller deal, you're focused on how to intergrate the new company into your own."</p>
<p>The study found those deals consumated in the 1990s were more likely to increase shareholder value than those consummated in the mid-to-late 1980s because M&amp;A activity in recent years has been more strategically focused.  </p>
<p>"The most successful deals are those in which the acquiring company is always keeping integration in mind instead of just screening candidates and then figuring out how to work them in," said Patterson.  "It's the vision thing.  Keeping the acquisitions strategically focused instead of saying, 'Hey this looks like a good buy; we'll figure out what to do with it later.'"</p>
<p>And once companies have decided to do a deal, a clear, decisive leader must emerge who can see the economies of scale and who can quickly integrate the companies, he said.  </p>
<p>"If the deal makes sense, then get it done in six months. If you're still looking at the same people across the table two years later, then how much value have you squandered in that time?" Patterson said, adding economies of scale are to be expected in the industry.  "Utilities have basically the same people doing the same things and customers who are similar in their requirements."</p>
<p>He noted that in the electric utility industry, "there is a natural tendency to enter agreements as partners; but there must be a first among equals -- something that does not come naturally to this group (of executives)."</p>
<p>And as in all regulated industries that have moved to deregulation, whether it be airlines, railroads, natural gas or truck, "there is a natural consolidation of market share," Patterson said.</p>
