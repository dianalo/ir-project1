<p>Sri Lanka's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is seeking investment promotion plans from the Colombo Stock Exchange and the Unit Trusts Association following a market upturn, an SEC official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"We believe the recent turnaround should be used to attract investment into the stocks market and unit trusts," said Kumar Paul, director-general of the SEC.</p>
<p>Colombo's all share index has gained 4.2 percent or 25.95 points so far this year on the back of good corporate profits in the last quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>The stock market declined last year after corporate profits by hurt by power cuts due to a drought.</p>
<p>"It is a good time to carry out a well thought out plan to encourage investors to return to stocks and units, after many got burnt in last year's decline," Paul said.</p>
