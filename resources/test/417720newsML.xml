<headline>SIMEX confirms listing of revised fuel oil futures.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-03-04</dateline>

<p>The Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) confirmed on Tuesday that it planned to list a revised fuel oil futures contract from April 22.</p>
<p>A statement said a futures contract covering June and the subsequent eight months would be listed from that date.</p>
<p>The statement listed a range of changes to the specifications of the contract, geared to reinvigorating a market that has been dormant since August 1995.</p>
<p>The statement said the most important change was cutting the sulphur content of the fuel oil to be delivered against a contract to 3.5 percent from 4.0 percent.  </p>
<p>"The changes have been made to bring the contract specifications in line with the cargo market's specifications, to enable the convergence of futures prices to those traded in the physical markets, and to facilitate physical delivery of the contract (where desired)," the statement said.</p>
<p>The revisions also included block trading in 50-contract lots (5,000 tonnes), or multiples of 50-contract lots.</p>
<p>Delivery can be made in quantities of 100-contract lots, or 10,000 tonnes, or multiples of 10,000 tonnes. Outstanding lots, of less than 100-contract lots will be cash settled.  </p>
<p>The date range for physical deliveries against the contract will be between the 11th and the 20th of each month. Buyers will have the loading date option and sellers the option to nominate an exchange approved loading refinery or terminal.</p>
