<p>Mannesmann is in talks with Endesa and Italy's Stet for a possible cooperation on Spain's second basic telephone operator Retevision, sources at the German telecoms firm told Reuters.</p>
<p>"We are talking to Endesa and Stet to study cooperation possibilities if their (consortium) should win the Retevision auction," the source said.</p>
<p>However sources at the Endesa consortium said on Thursday they had received no formal communication of Mannesman's interest.</p>
<p>"There may have been informal contacts before the offer on Monday, but there has been nothing at an institutional level," the source said.</p>
<p>Mannesmann had decided not to bid for Retevision as it did not have sufficient time to present its own offer after being surprised by a change of partners at Telefonica in April.</p>
<p>"We thought that British Telecom would bid for Spain's second licence, but after its alliance with Telefonica, everything changed," the Mannesmann source said.</p>
<p>Endesa-Stet's bid for Retevision, announced on Monday, was 116.36 billion pesetas, while Opera, comprising Spain's BCH, France Telecom and U.S.-based Sprint, had offered just 84 billion pesetas for the initial 60 percent privatisation of Retevision.</p>
<p>Analysts expect the Endesa group to win the auction.</p>
