<p>Pumping operations along one of Colombia's main oil pipelines were still paralyzed Tuesday following a leftist rebel dynamite attack over the weekend, oil company officials said.</p>
<p>Repair teams were due to travel Tuesday afternoon to the site where the blast occurred, near the town of Arauquita in eastern Arauca province, after the army moved in to secure the zone against further rebel attacks.</p>
<p>A spokesman for state-run oil company Ecopetrol said there was still no assessment of the size of the crude spillage nor of extent of the break in the pipeline which runs from the Cano Limon field, operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp, and the Caribbean coast lifting terminal at Covenas.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Occidental said production was still continuing at the Cano Limon field, also in Arauca province, and that there was still "some margin" in limited crude storage facilities at the field.</p>
<p>"Repair teams are being mobilized. We hope they can be in place this afternoon and progress with repair work and maybe pumping could restart Wednesday," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Rebels of the Cuban-inspired National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia's second largest guerrilla force, were blamed for the blast which took place Sunday morning.</p>
<p>The rebels later shot down a helicopter flying troops into the hot spot, killing 20 soldiers and one civilian crew member.</p>
<p>The Cano Limon pipeline pumps about 200,000 barrels of crude per day. Until the completion of the Ocensa pipeline, which runs from British Petroleum Co Plc's  BP.Lu field in Cusiana to Covenas, the Cano Limon pipeline was the largest in the country.</p>
