<p>VSZ a.s., Slovakia's largest steel producer, has purchased a Hawker 800 XP jet plane for $11.5 million, the official Slovak news agency TASR said on Monday.</p>
<p>TASR said that according to leasing conditions, VSZ has already paid 25 percent of the plane's price, which in total amounts to one-quarter of its expected 1996 after-tax profit of $40.6 million.</p>
<p>VSZ said the new eight passenger plane, built by U.S-based Raytheon Aircraft Company, will be used by management for business trips abroad. The company also plans to hire the plane to other Slovak entrepreneurs for their travels.</p>
<p>VSZ currently owns the domestic Cassovia Air.</p>
<p>TASR quoted VSZ officials as saying the company is the first private firm in central and eastern Europe to own a jet airplane.</p>
