<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat will meet on Sunday at the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip, an Arafat adviser said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Netanyahu had called off a meeting scheduled for Thursday after 73 soldiers died in northern Israel on Tuesday in the worst air disaster in the country's military history.</p>
<p>The two men were to discuss implementation of the Hebron agreement signed last month.</p>
<p>"The meeting between President Arafat and Prime Minister Netanyahu will be held on Sunday evening," Nabil Abu Rdaineh, Arafat's adviser, told Reuters.</p>
<p>A spokesman in Netanyahu's office said he was checking the report of the meeting.</p>
