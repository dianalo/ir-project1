<p>Shares of Wah Lee Resources Holdings Ltd ended their trading debut at HK$1.46 per share on Friday, up HK$0.46 or 46 percent from their issue price of HK$1.00 per share.</p>
<p>"It performed very well today," said Kinson Au, senior analyst at PW Asia Brokerage. "The surge was seen supported by a relatively strong subscription response in flotation."</p>
<p>Shares of the air conditioning systems, audio visual and photographic products distributor moved in a range of HK$1.18 to HK$1.47. Volume was 140.8 million shares worth HK$184.64 million.</p>
<p>"The surge was higher than we expected," said Henry Lui, analyst at Mansion House Research. "Many investors were happy to see the rise as they can realise quite an attractive profit."</p>
<p>Wah Lee offered 70 million shares at HK$1.00 each in an initial public offer (IPO) in Hong Kong. One warrant was attached for every five shares subscribed.</p>
<p>Its IPO was 32.6 times subscribed.</p>
<p>The company said net proceeds would be used to promote products, set up product display showrooms across China, buy a warehouse in Hong Kong and for working capital.  </p>
<p>Analysts said they expected profit-taking to pressure the share price in the short run before it consolidated.</p>
<p>They said Wah Lee's concept of tapping into China's growing consumer market would remain an attraction for investors in the longer term.</p>
