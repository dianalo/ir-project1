<title>USA: IRS seeks back taxes, penalties from Caltex.</title>
<headline>IRS seeks back taxes, penalties from Caltex.</headline>

<p>Caltex Petroleum Corp, a joint venture between Texaco Inc and Chevron Corp, said it has received a claim from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for $292 million in excise taxes, plus interest and penalties, for back taxes 17 years ago.</p>
<p>"Caltex believes that it is unreasonable for the IRS to pursue this excise tax claim 17 years after the fact and 12 years after the IRS completed their audit of Caltex for the year in question," Caltex chief financial officer Malcolm McAuley said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The IRS claim relates to crude oil sales to Japanese customers beginning in 1980, when a subsidiary became a contractual supplier of crude oil to Japanese customers, Caltex said.</p>
<p>The IRS contends this move was a transfer of property and a taxable event, Caltex said.</p>
<p>Just as Caltex believes the underlying excise tax claim is wrong, Caltex also said it believes the related claim for approximately $140 million in penalties is equally wrong and the IRS claim for almost $1.6 billion in interest charges is flawed.  </p>
<p>Caltex said the likelihood that it would be faced with such charges is remote.</p>
<p>Caltex will challenge the claim and fully expects to prevail since the addition of another supplying company was not a taxable event.</p>
<p>Chevron and Texaco have stated they believe this claim is entirely without merit and will have no material impact on their respective financial positions.</p>
