<p>The Irish government, worried about Northern Ireland's steady slide back into communal violence, voiced concern to Britain on Friday about a planned protest march by Northern Ireland Protestants to a Roman Catholic Church at the weekend.</p>
<p>Dublin's disquiet was conveyed by Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring when he met Britain's Northern Ireland secretary, Sir Patrick Mayhew, for the first ministerial-level review of Northern Ireland this year by the two governments.</p>
<p>The two men discussed the fraught security situation in the province into the early hours of Friday two days before the first anniversary of the ending of an Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrilla truce which ended a 17-month peace honeymoon. As they met, Northern Ireland police said they had found a suspected IRA mortar near the town of Lurgan of the sort used by the guerrillas in their 27-year war to end British rule of the province and reunite it with the Irish republic.</p>
<p>Security spokesmen said that if the missile had been fired at a target such as a British military vehicle "then death and injury would definitely have resulted."</p>
<p>The IRA has staged attacks on British troops or local police every week this year in an apparent attempt to provoke retaliation by Protestant gunmen observing a two-year truce.</p>
<p>Security sources say they want to provoke a complete breakdown of law and order so the next British government after a general election which must be held by May 22 has to call new peace talks and invite the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, without conditions.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein is excluded from peace talks under way in Belfast because of the IRA's return to war last February when it bombed London's Canary Wharf business complex.</p>
<p>Spring, who is also Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister, told Mayhew that Dublin was worried about the potentially inflammatory march planned for Saturday night by Protestant Loyalists who want Northern Ireland to stay British.</p>
<p>They intend to march to a church at Harryville near Ballymena on Saturday night to picket a Catholic church that has been a target for Protestant protest for months.</p>
<p>"We raised concerns over what has been happening over many months in Harryville. I think it is fair to say that protests and pickets outside places of worship are unacceptable in any community in Northern Ireland," Spring told reporters.</p>
<p>Spring said he was disappointed that Britain had failed to implement the recommendations of an independent commission on Northern Ireland's Protestant marches, which last year sparked violent protest across the province.</p>
<p>"The people of Northern Ireland want a change in the manner in which parades are handled, and the review has made sensible and workable recommendations, arrived at after extensive consultation and consideration.</p>
<p>"We have not been encouraged by the British government's indication that it will begin only a partial implementation of the recommendations, despite widespread support for it at Westminster," Spring said before the talks started. But Mayhew said there would be a consultation period lasting until the end of March.</p>
<p>"A commission will be appointed very, very soon to look at marching...but to do much more than that -- to help conciliation, to help people get together, to help people make local agreements," he told BBC radio.</p>
<p>Spring said it was important to avoid a re-run of last year's showdown between Protestant Orange order marchers and police which sparked the worst civil unrest for decades.</p>
