<p>THE PROTEUS COLUMN</p>
<p>Second quarter 1997 results coming in from reinsurers broadly indicate a fairly steady follow up to the strong results posted in Q1. However the sector may find there are some problems lying just below the surface which could soon emerge.</p>
<p>The larger reinsurers could find competition between each other getting even fiercer than it is now. In the wake of the losses at the beginning of the decade which forced several reinsurers out of business, the big players have emphasised what they call the flight to quality - where buyers take their reinsurance to large, highly-secure, triple-A rated reinsurers at the expense of smaller firms. Hence the wave of consolidation over the last 14 months.</p>
<p>But the flight to quality is running out of steam. Now the reinsurance industry's financial strength and a large portion of its capacity is concentrated in a couple of dozen companies. Those firms may inevitably be forced to compete for market share against themselves. That will eventually come down to price competition no matter what an organization's disciplined underwriting strategy may dictate.</p>
<p>In addition, many of the primary insurers who buy reinsurance have seen growth figures dwindle. The usual unimaginative but effective answer is to cut costs, and one way of doing that is to cut the reinsurance bill. Many primary companies are increasing their retentions in order to make up for flagging premium growth, thus offering a smaller portion of the overall premium pie to reinsurers.</p>
<p>The same effect is produced by the growing tendency for reinsurance packages to include finite characteristics and a financial aspect, again cutting into the pure premium pie left over for reinsurers to share.</p>
<p>Another tough issue in a soft market is reserving. Most reinsurers do not change their reserving formulas just because the market is soft. The problem is that if you continue to base a formula on a declining premium base, you end up with less reserves. This is fine if the risk exposure decreases as well, but can every underwriter of such a line put his hand on his heart and say that is the case?</p>
<p>Known liabilities such as environmental damage and asbestosis have not yet gone away, and new ones are looming all the time. But in the current pricing environment, the reserves reinsurers are putting away cannot be as good as the reserves they were piling up a few years ago.</p>
