<p>Australian Telecommuniciations Minister Richard Alston said on Thursday the government would not adopt any plan to force the state-owned Telstra Corp and the privately held Optus Vision to build a single broad-band optic fibre network instead of the two networks planned now.</p>
<p>Alston said there had been suggestions that a dual rollout by Telstra and Optus Vision was wasteful and government should force a single rollout.  </p>
<p>"The argument goes that the government should simply prescribe a single technology to be rolled out by the incumbent carrier and then set appropriate sharing arrangements for new entrants," Alston said in a speech delivered to a telecommunications school launch. The speech was delivered by department deputy secretary Cathy Santamaria.</p>
<p>"Australia's communications future will not be secured through the re-imposition of the sort of publicly owned monopoly solutions now being abandoned in the world's major telecommunications markets in Europe and North America," Alston said.  </p>
<p>"It is the government's firm view that the long term interests of Australian consumers will be enhanced by competition between communications networks," he said.</p>
<p>"While superficially attractive, an industry based on the vertical seperation of carriage and content and the introduction of a cable monopoly is neither practical or desirable."</p>
<p>Some industry players have lobbied the government to force Telstra and its cable television joint venture partner News Corp Ltd to join Optus Vision in a single cable rollout.  </p>
<p>Telstra and Optus Vision are currently each rolling out their own optic fibre networks at huge cost throughout the major cities in Eastern Australia.</p>
<p>Optus Vision is 46.5 percent owned by both Australian telecommunications carrier Optus Communications and Continental CableVision Inc, which has merged with U.S. West. The balance of Optus Vision is owned by Seven Network Ltd and Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd.</p>
<p>Alston said the prospect of separate networks would encourage Telstra and Optus to offer reasonable interconnectivity terms to yet more competitors.  </p>
<p>He said Telstra and Optus were also open to combine their networks as part of some future commercial arrangement, subject to the normal scrutiny of the competition regulator, The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission.</p>
