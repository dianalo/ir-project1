<headline>Canada's Brick Brewing to buy arch-rival Algonquin.</headline>
<dateline>WATERLOO, Ontario</dateline>
<text>
<p>Brick Brewing Co. Ltd, which helped launch Canada's fast-growing microbrew industry, said on Friday it agreed to acquire arch-rival Northern Algonquin Brewing Co. Ltd. in a stock and cash deal.</p>
<p>Brick's planned acquisition of Algonquin for $4.28 million and 200,000 shares, was the first in an expected round of consolidation among Canadian microbrewers.</p>
<p>Microbrewers account for only about three percent of Canada's beer sales, but are growing at a 10 percent yearly rate compared to flat sales for large brewers such as Labatt Brewing Co. Ltd., which is a unit of Belgium's Interbrew and Molson Breweries, owned by Molson Cos Ltd., Foster's Brewing Group and Philip Morris Cos. Inc.</p>
<p>Canadian microbreweries such as Upper Canada Brewing Co. Ltd., Sleeman Breweries Ltd. and Big Rock Brewery Ltd. have all been spending heavily to expand their plants, boost sales and widen their distribution.</p>
<p>Under the deal, Brick would acquire Formosa, Ontario-based Northern Algonquin's Formosa Brewery, the Algonquin and Formosa beer brands and to the Formosa Springs, which lie beneath the brewery and supply it with spring water.</p>
