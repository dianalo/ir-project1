<p>CSCE world sugar futures settled slightly firmer and at a key chart level basis the May contract, setting the stage for further gains Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>The close at Friday's high of 11.03 basis May could prompt fresh speculative buying and some short-covering by the trade. One floor source said that while the most recent spec/hedge report showed the speculators already have a heavy net long position, there could be more room to put on fresh positions.</p>
<p>"The market is capable of moving higher. It's all up to the speculators," he said.</p>
<p>Indeed, early speculative buying drove the May contract through resistance at 11.08 cents, the high reached March 3, to the day's high of 11.09 cents.</p>
<p>Trade scale-up selling kept pressure on the market, knocking the contract off the highs and back to unchanged in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Some traders said the failure of the spot month to end over 11.03 cents signals firm resistance, adding that prices could retreat on Tuesday.</p>
<p>May rose 0.06 on the day to 11.03 cents, having ranged form 11.09 to 10.95. The back months settled 0.03 higher to 0.03 lower, with producers noted as the main sellers in the deferred contracts.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 11,414 lots compared with Friday's official 12,389 lots.</p>
<p>The May/July spread closed at 0.26 cent compared with 0.23 cent Friday. The trade was cited as both a buyer and a seller of the spread, floor sources said.</p>
