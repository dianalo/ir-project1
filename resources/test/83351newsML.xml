<p>The Security Council late on Saturday deplored the "brutal execution" of former Afghanistan President Najibullah who was abducted by Taleban rebels from a U.N. compound where he had been given asylum.</p>
<p>The council in a statement also expressed "grave concern" about the military confrontation in Afghanistan, including the takeover of the capital city of Kabul.</p>
<p>The statement, read at a formal meeting, mentions the Taleban by name in connection with the murder of Najibullah but otherwise refrains from criticising the radical Islamic militia directly for its takeover of Kabul.</p>
<p>Russia, which initiated the statement, had wanted more direct criticism of the Taleban, which took over Kabul early on Friday, executed Najibullah and his brother Shahpur Ahmadzai and strung their bodies up on a tower in public view.</p>
<p>Afghanistan has been the scene of continual fighting between various Moslem and ethnic groups since Soviet troops supporting a communist government withdrew in 1989.</p>
<p>Najibullah led a Moscow-backed government in Afghanistan for six years and was ousted on April 16, 1992, by Moslem Mujahedeen, who refused to let him leave the country and join his family in India. He sought refuge behind the walls of U.N. headquarters in Kabul, an unwilling recluse.</p>
<p>The council's statement calls on all states to refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and to help promote peace in cooperation with the U.N. mission there.</p>
<p>It also calls for an immediate end to fighting and asks all Afghan leaders "to renounce the use of force, to put aside their differences and to engage in a political dialogue."</p>
<p>On Najibullah, the council said it was "concerned at the violation of the United Nations premises in Kabul and expresses dismay at the brutal execution by the Taleban of the former president of Afghanistan, Najibullah, and others who had taken refuge in these premises."</p>
<p>On Friday, a representative of Afghanistan's ousted government called on the world not to recognise any regime the rebels would create and accused Pakistan of aiding Taleban.</p>
<p>Adbul Rahim Ghafoorzai, Afghanistan's deputy foreign minister, told reporters that President Burhanuddin Rabbani and his advisers had retreated to the north of Kabul to Parwan and Kapisa provinces and were contemplating their next move.</p>
<p>Pakistan's U.N. ambassador, Ahmad Kamal, said the old government was finished, Gahfoorzai had no standing and that the Taleban was in complete control of Kabul. Pakistan was anxious that the Security Council not condemn the Taleban for its takeover of Kabul, diplomats said.</p>
<p>In Afghanistan, the Taleban paused in its pursuit of forces loyal to the ousted president, who were apparently regrouping in the Panjshir Valley north of Kabul, and instead concentrated on consolidating its hold over the capital.</p>
<p>It has set up a strict fundamentalist Moslem government that imposed restrictions on women after capturing the city against little resistance on Friday at the climax of a sweep through eastern Afghanistan.</p>
