<p>Wisconsin Congressman Mark Neumann said Monday he was forming an exploratory committee to challenge Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold.</p>
<p>Neumann, a two-term Republican congressman from Janesville, toured six cities Monday to announce that he had formed the committee to test a possible candidacy for a six-year term in the United States Senate.</p>
<p>Neumann, who represents southeastern Wisconsin's 1st District, said he will make a decision by the end of the year.</p>
<p>He picked Monday to make his announcement to highlight his support for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution ahead of Tuesday's scheduled vote in the Senate. Feingold has been a consistent opponent of the amendment.</p>
