<p>Privately owned Qatar Airways has signed a 32 million riyal ($8.8 million) deal with British Airways for the supply of a new computerised reservation system, Qatar Airways chief executive Akbar al-Baker said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The BA system, known as BABS, in conjunction with the travel agency systems, Sabre and Galileo, will help the airline improve its reservation processing, check-in and revenue accounting systems," al-Baker told reporters.</p>
<p>The system will be introduced on April 1.</p>
<p>The agreement was signed on board the British royal yacht Britannia at Doha Port on Wednesday by Alan Parrott, general manager of BA subsidiary Speedwing, and Baker.</p>
<p>Qatar Airways currently uses SITA for reservations and a manual system for revenue accounting.</p>
