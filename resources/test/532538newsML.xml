<headline>German IBIS DAX ends off highs, lower on Wall St.</headline>

<p>Germany's DAX index ended the day firmer on Wednesday, but off earlier highs as stocks pared some of their gains on a slightly lower opening on the Dow Jones Industrials Index on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index, which tracks electronic trade in 30 German blue-chip shares, ended up 17.97 points, or 0.54 percent, at 3,366.87 points.</p>
<p>Earlier its bourse trade counterpart, the DAX index, shrugged off weakness in one of its heavyweight shares, Siemens AG, to post solid gains in bourse trade and ended up 55.62 points at 3,395.95 points.</p>
<p>German market players said there were worries about upcoming elections in France and Britain and their impact on the debate over the start of European currency union.</p>
<p>There was pressure on electronics group Siemens AG after it reported flat first-half results for its 1996/97 business year and gave a muted outlook for the balance of the year.</p>
<p>Siemens shares, the most heavily-traded during the day, ended the day down 2.90 marks at 88.00 marks.</p>
<p>"The figures were disappointing simply because they were in line with expectations," said one trader, noting the stock had risen strongly in recent days ahead of the results.</p>
<p>Traders said dealings in the afternoon and on Thursday would depend on movements in New York amid a lack of fresh fundamentals to influence the German market.</p>
<p>Among other shares, preference shares in haircare products group Wella AG ended the day up 77 marks, or eight percent, at 1,039 marks as Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said it had raised its recommendation in the stock to "overweight" from "neutral".</p>
<p>Wella said on Tuesday it expected 1997 net profits to climb 25 percent, with sales up seven percent.</p>
<p>Airline Lufthansa continued to rise as dealers cited strong technical factors and a general positive mood surrounding recent fundamentals in the stock, notably its continuing restructuring to boost profits.</p>
<p>Lufthansa shares ended up 63 pfennigs, or 2.71 percent, at 23.88 marks.</p>
<p>Auto shares were mostly higher in line with the market as dealers said the sector's rally, recently interrupted by a small pause, may now be back on track.</p>
<p>BMW gained 28.50 marks to 1,397.50 but fell back to end the day up 12 marks at 1,381 marks. Daimler-Benz AG pared early gains to end down 20 pfennigs at 127.70 marks, while Volkswagen ended the day up 18 marks, or 1.69 percent, at 1,081 marks.</p>
