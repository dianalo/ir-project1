<p>The strongest El Nino weather pattern since 1983 will likely have little impact on U.S. crops this summer, several meteorologists said.</p>
<p>"There is not much correlation between developing El Nino at this time of year and what it does for the summer season," said Fred Gesser, chief forecaster for Weather Express Inc. "The correlation comes in the winter months when we will see a warmer than normal winter for the Midwest."</p>
<p>El Nino is a weather pattern triggered by warm south Pacific Ocean temperatures. It can have a profound impact on world crop weather.  </p>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on Tuesday said said El Nino strengthened in May. Meteorologists said water temperatures in the south Pacific were the warmest since 1983 when El Nino caused a searing drought in Indonesia, South Africa, Australia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Farmers from India to Australia were concerned that this year's El Nino would have a similar effect, and futures markets reacted accordingly on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wheat contracts on the Sydney Futures Exchange firmed as the El Nino scare deepened market concern over looming dry weather through much of the growing season.  </p>
<p>But the timing of this year's El Nino may be a boon to U.S. farmers. Basilio Lopez, assistant meteorologist for Smith Barney, said the impact on U.S. growing areas is typically minor when El Nino develops at this time of year.</p>
<p>"There's really not a bias," Lopez said. "We tend to look at El Ninos as having a more detrimental impact when they develop over the winter and continue through the summer."  </p>
<p>While El Nino was in effect in 1988 when a severe drought shaved millions of bushels off of U.S. corn and soybean production, the hot and dry summer was linked more to a strong subtropical ridge formation rather than the warm ocean temperatures, said Mike Palmerino, meteorologist with Weather Services Corp.</p>
<p>"None of the research that we have seen suggests that El Nino generates hot and dry periods in the Midwest," Palmerino said. "The decade of the '90s has not featured subtropical ridging. We're not in a regime right now that would feature that type of scenario."</p>
<p>El Nino strengthened in May, but Weather Express's Gesser said U.S. meteorologists will be on the lookout for a decrease in intensity.</p>
<p>"Right now we have to see if this El Nino is going to persist through the growing season," Gesser said. "Dying El Ninos have produced dramatic heat and dryness in U.S. growing areas in the past."</p>
