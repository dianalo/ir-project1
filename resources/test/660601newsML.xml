<title>REPUBLIC OF IRELAND: Irish bonds firm on back of Irish inflation data.</title>
<headline>Irish bonds firm on back of Irish inflation data.</headline>

<p>Irish bonds continued to firm amid steady trade on Friday, boosted by better-than expected May Irish inflation data, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The CPI figures contained no worries at all and generated a healthy relief trade," a dealer said. "After several weeks of underperformance, we're outperforming Germany today by three or four basis points and more at the very short end."</p>
<p>An unexpected drop in U.S. producer prices had added to the positive international backdrop created by yesterday's weaker-than-expected U.S. retail sales figures, pushing bond prices up across Europe, the dealer added.</p>
<p>By 1500 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 was up 18 pence at 101.93 to yield 5.97 percent, while the eight percent bond due 2006 was up 45 pence at 109.55 to yield 6.57 percent.</p>
<p>Yields against German Bunds narrowed to 162 basis points over in the five-year bond, and 87 over in the 10-year -- a convergence of five basis points in each.</p>
<p>Analysts said on Friday that the May Irish inflation data removed any prospect of an imminent interest rate rise but warned that Ireland was not out of the woods on the inflation front.</p>
<p>Ireland's May consumer price index rose by 0.2 percent on April and was up 1.5 percent year-on-year, at the lower end of market expectations.</p>
<p>"We should see a positive effect on the short end of the market," a dealer said.</p>
<p>But analysts warned that there could be inflation trouble further down the line, particularly if the Irish pound remains weak.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury bonds pushed higher on Friday, helping European bond markets, as an unexpected drop in U.S. producer prices increased hopes for no rise in U.S. rates anytime soon.</p>
<p>U.S. producer prices fell 0.3 percent in May, their fifth straight decline and making it the first time the index has dropped five months in succession since 1952.</p>
<p>The underlying ex-food and energy figure also fell 0.3 percent, compared with an expected 0.1 percent rise in both figures.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, dealers said, it was "by no means certain" that questions raised by France over the EMU stability pact would be resolved at a summit next week.</p>
<p>"Markets are in good shape right now but the EMU backdrop is still unstable and there is definitely the potential for fireworks at the Amsterdam summit," a dealer said.</p>
