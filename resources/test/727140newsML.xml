<p>CBOT soymeal and soyoil futures were sharply higher early Monday, mostly in response to big weather-related gains in soybeans, traders said.</p>
<p>CBOT new crop soybeans surged the daily 30-cent trading limit near the open as concerns about dry weather in the U.S. Midwest mounted following a rain-free weekend.</p>
<p>August soymeal rallied up the daily $10.00 per ton trading limit before falling back a bit, and August soyoil also rallied the daily 1.00 cent a lb trading limit before retreating.</p>
<p>Commission houses and commodity funds were scattered buyers in both pits, traders said.</p>
<p>At 1025 CDT, August soymeal was $8.60 cents per bushel higher at $254.20 a bushel and other months were up $7.80 to $9.30. August soyoil was 0.65 cent a lb higher at 22.58 cents, and other months were up 0.54 to 0.67.</p>
