<p>Hong Kong companies were in the Asian debt news on Friday.</p>
<p>Wharf Holdings has opted to tap U.S. investors with a Yankee bond, while other firms in the territory have taken the loan route.</p>
<p>Wharf Holdings began roadshowing its planned Yankee bond in Hong Kong. While details have not been set, bankers expect the bond to have a long maturity and perhaps two tranches.</p>
<p>There have been rumours for weeks that Wharf and other Hong Kong conglomerates would take advantage of a good market for Hong Kong and China credits in international markets.</p>
<p>Hong Kong and China bonds have performed extremely well in secondary markets over the last several months.</p>

<p>Bankers now say that New World Infrastructure, long tipped as a potential Yankee issuer, will borrow US$500 million through a loan issue arranged by HSBC Investment Bank Asia and Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Wheelock and Co also is taking the loan route. Bankers said the company is mulling a HK$3.0 billion deal. It has a maturity of three years extendible at the borrower's option to five.</p>
<p>The loan pays a margin of 50 basis points over the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate and an all-in return of 62.5 basis points to top tier participants.</p>
<p>ABN Amro, Chase Manhattan Asia and Hang Seng Bank are arrangers, bankers said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Phillipines' Belle Corp launched a US$100 million floating rate note issue. Deutsche Morgan Grenfell is bookrunner. DMG and Hanwha Merchant Bank are joint leads.</p>
<p>The five-year, one-month FRN was launched at par to float at 180 basis points over the London Interbank Offered Rate. With fees, it pays an all-in return of 200 basis points.</p>
<p>Southern Asia will see some action in the capital markets in March, with Sri Lanka launching its FRN and a number of Indian</p>
