<p>Switzerland's new ambassador to the United States said on Sunday it would take years for his country's image to recover after the recent furore over Swiss behaviour during World War Two.</p>
<p>The envoy, Alfred Defago who had previously been consul-general in New York, was speaking in an interview with the German-language newspaper Sonntagszeitung.</p>
<p>"Previously, Switzerland's image (in the United States) was good with no problems," said Defago, whose predecessor Carlo Jagmetti stepped down after saying the country was faced with waging war against its U.S. and Jewish detractors.</p>
<p>"Now suddenly people are confronted with an unknown side of Switzerland," Defago added. "For the media, it was of course interesting to put a spotlight on the dark side of the star pupil.</p>
<p>"It will take major efforts, outside of just the diplomatic channels, to restore Switzerland's image. This will not take months but rather several years at least," the Swiss diplomat declared.</p>
<p>U.S. congressmen and Jewish leaders have accused Switzerland of holding on to funds deposited by German Jews who later died in Nazi camps as well as acting as a conduit for gold stolen by the Nazis from occupied countries during the war.</p>
<p>Swiss economy minister and then rotating president Jean-Pascal Delamuraz caused a storm at the end of last year when he said the country was being blackmailed by world Jewish leaders into setting up a fund to compensate Holocaust victims.</p>
<p>He later apologised and the Swiss government has moved to ensure creation of a credible fund.</p>
<p>In New York last Friday, major participants in the row publicly declared an end to their confrontation as the United States offered its help in setting up the fund.</p>
<p>A meeting between Jewish leaders and Swiss, Israeli and U.S. officials ended with participants hailing a new spirit of cooperation to resolve what has been called the last chapter of the Holocaust -- a battle over how to compensate victims.</p>
<p>Jewish organisations had been considering calling for a boycott by Jews around the world of Swiss banks.</p>
<p>"Things are back on track after getting out of hand and emotional," World Jewish Congress President Edgar Bronfman said, at a news conference in which he was flanked by the chief U.S. and Swiss officials dealing with the issue.</p>
<p>Earlier, Switzerland's chief critic in the U.S. Senate, Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato, had declared himself satisfied a new page had been turned in Swiss-Jewish relations.</p>
<p>D'Amato, who for weeks had been accusing Swiss bankers of acting as Hitler's money-launderers, praised the new spirit of cooperation evident at the meeting, made possible by the creation of the fund.</p>
<p>The Swiss government, which six weeks ago said it would never establish such a fund, announced earlier in the week that it would take over a private $71 million fund set up by the country's three biggest banks and work with the WJC and Swiss Jews to set up a mechanism for its "timely distribution."</p>
