<p>China plans to put plastic payment cards in the hands of 200 million consumers within the next five years, but most of them will be debit and not credit cards, Visa International executives said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"China has an objective to have 200 million cards issued in five years," said Edmund Jensen, president and chief executive officer of Visa International.</p>
<p>"That seems very ambitious, yet we don't really think that's overly ambitious," he said in an interview. "We think that's a very achievable number."</p>
<p>But China will first have to put in place a more efficient payment system and educate people in the use of non-cash payment instruments, they said.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities have not revealed the total number of cards currently in use, but estimates range from 25 million upwards, industry analysts said.</p>
<p>Almost all the Visa and other cards issued in China so far are debit cards, where a sum must first be deposited in a bank account from which payments can be drawn.</p>
<p>Economists say the development of personal credit in China has been hampered by weak infrastructure, a high savings rate, and the problems of dealing with people who default on payments.</p>
<p>"China is moving slowly to expand the business to a true credit line," said Raymond Chan, Visa's executive vice president and general manager for North Asia and Asia-Pacific region.</p>
<p>Jensen said Visa currently has 12 million cards on issue in China through associations with 10 different Chinese banks.</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has issued a few thousand true Visa credit cards and the Guangdong Development Bank this week began offering the card to customers, he said.</p>
<p>Visa and its competitors must overcome a psychological barrier and make Chinese consumers and merchants accept cards as a substitute for cash, Jensen said.</p>
<p>"The whole system is based on trust...the customer knows it will work and the merchant knows he is going to get paid," said Jensen.</p>
<p>Visa on Thursday launched a new card, called the Shanghai Museum Visa Dragon Affinity Card, in Shanghai. Part of the annual fee of the card will be channelled to the Shanghai Museum.</p>
