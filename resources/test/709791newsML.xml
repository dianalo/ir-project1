<p>The New York Yankees' steady-hitting first baseman Tino Martinez was the surprise winner of the Home Run Derby Monday on All-Star workout day at Jacobs Field.</p>
<p>Martinez, among the major-league leaders with 28 homers this season, belted a total of 16 homers in 41 swings and defeated National League home-run leader Larry Walker of the Colorado Rockies 3-1 in the final round.</p>
<p>"I don't even hit home runs that good in batting practice," said Martinez.</p>
<p>"I just wanted to represent the Yankees and do something respectable, like hit two or three homers and advance to the second round," Martinez said. "I really didn't expect to win."</p>
<p>Martinez hit five homers in the opening round. Also advancing with Martinez and Walker were Oakland Athletics first baseman Mark McGwire, the major-league leader with 31 home runs this season, and Houston Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell.</p>
<p>Martinez ripped eight into the seats, including four in a row, in the second round to join Walker in the final. Walker blasted nine in the first round and matched Martinez with four straight homers en route to another nine in the second round.</p>
<p>Each batter was allowed only five non-homer swings in the final round, as opposed to 10 in the first two rounds, and Martinez connected on his first two swings. After two "outs", he belted another. Walker could manage only one, on his second swing.</p>
<p>"With five swings, anything can happen and I was fortunate that Larry couldn't get it going in the last round," said Martinez, who has four career regular-season home runs at Jacobs Field.</p>
<p>"I like to hit the ball here because I can hit the right field seats pretty easily."</p>
<p>While Martinez came away the winner, it was Walker who supplied the most excitement. Eleven of his 19 homers travelled over 400 feet (120 metres) and his 479-foot (145 metres) blast which reached the second deck in right-centre field was the longest shot of the day.</p>
<p>"He was awesome," Martinez said. "I think he just got a little tired after all the swings he took in the second round."</p>
<p>"I lost focus and got under a couple of pitches in the final round," said Walker, who has 25 homers this season. "Martinez deserved to win."</p>
<p>McGwire slugged five homers in the opening round, but managed only two in the second round.</p>
<p>Bagwell hit four in the first round and won a tiebreaker, based on regular-season home runs, with Baltimore's Brady Anderson. He hit just one in the second round.</p>
<p>Ken Griffey Jr., who has 30 homers this season, failed to reach the seats on his first seven swings. Griffey connected on three of his next six, but came up short of qualifying for the second round.</p>
<p>Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants, the 1996 Home Run Derby champion, did not compete this year.</p>
<p>Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra won the rookie homer-hitting contest with three. "A year ago I was on the disabled list in the minors, now I'm an All-Star and win the rookie homer contest," he said. "Wow!"</p>
