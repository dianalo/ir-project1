<p>Ford Motor Co said Wednesday it is recalling nearly 680,000 vehicles for various problems, including 419,180 1996-97 Taurus, Sable, Lincoln Continental and Windstar minivans for transmission inspections.  </p>
<p>Ford said the park mechanism may not prevent the vehicle from rolling even if the shift lever is placed in the park position.</p>
<p>The recall involves 1996-97 models of the cars, and only 1996 versions of the minivan. Of the total vehicles, 19,613 are located in Canada.</p>
<p>Ford is recalling 248,515 1990-92 Probe coupes because the motorized seat belt assemblies may wear out.  Those recalled include 8,022 in Canada.  </p>
<p>Other recalls announced by Ford were: 5,950 1997 F-Super-Duty trucks with motorhome basic chassis, 89 of which are in Canada, because of battery cable insulation problems; 5,000 1996 Taurus SHO cars, 209 of which are in Canada, to replace fuel pressure regulators; and 1,300 1997 F-150 pickups, 73 of which are in Canada, for possible brake problems.</p>
<p>Ford spokeswoman Francine Romine-MacBride said the Probe repairs could take a full day. Other inspections and repairs are likely to take between one and two hours. Ford does not disclose the financial impacts of the recalls, she said.</p>
<p>There have been no reported accidents or injuries stemming from the transmission problems, Romine-MacBride said.  Of the 419,180 recalled, she said about 360,000 are Taurus and Sable cars.</p>
