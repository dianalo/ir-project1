<headline>U.S. expands search on Gulf chemical exposure.</headline>

<p>The Pentagon said on Thursday it is notifying 5,000 more U.S. Gulf War veterans that they may have been exposed to chemical weapons during the destruction of an Iraqi ammunition dump.</p>
<p>That announcement vastly expanded the search for possible victims after the military said earlier that only 150 U.S. troops could have suffered some exposure as they destroyed the Kamisiyah ammunition depot in southern Iraq in March 1991.</p>
<p>The new advisory said the expanded notifications were being made because deadly chemical nerve agents Sarin and Cyclosarin might have spread from 122mm rockets being destroyed in a pit area of the big arms complex.</p>
<p>"The Defence Department will begin notifications immediately to about 5,000 service members who were in the possible dispersion area," the announcement said. "Information currently being evaluated suggests low-level exposures may have taken place out to 25 kilometres (15 miles) from the Kamisiyah complex on March 10, 1991."</p>
<p>The U.S. government, on orders from President Bill Clinton, last year mounted a major effort to resolve medical complaints from as many as 60,000 U.S. Gulf War veterans. The complaints range from numbness to memory loss, but no common cause or "Gulf War syndrome" has been found .</p>
<p>The Defence Department and the Central Intelligence Agency are already working on a computer model that will estimate the possible dispersion of the chemical agents to troops that may have been anywhere near the Kamisiyah complex.</p>
<p>The Pentagon denied last month that it intentionally quashed a 1991 classified report suggesting that U.S. troops were exposed to Iraqi chemical weapons. But it conceded that "the full relevance of the report ... was not recognised at the time" and it was not investigated until this year, providing indications that perhaps 150 soldiers were exposed to chemical agents when they blew up the Kamisiyah site.</p>
<p>Defence Secretary William Perry said the secret document was circulated within the government and to U.S. military officials at the time and the "complex" issue was still being investigated. But the document, based on a visit by U.N. inspectors to the Kamisiyah complex in 1991, was not provided to the U.S. engineer battalion involved or to the public.</p>
<p>The report was circulated to U.S. military commanders worldwide and then filed away even as the Defence Department repeatedly suggested it had no evidence that large numbers of U.S. troops might have been exposed to chemical arms.</p>
