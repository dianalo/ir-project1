<p>Denmark said on Monday it would not back down from tabling a resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission criticising China's human rights record, despite warnings from Beijing of a political and trade backlash.</p>
<p>"We alerted China in advance about our move through diplomatic channels, we told them very clearly what our intention was, we have made our decision and will stick to it," Danish foreign minister Niels Helveg Petersen told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>"I expected the Chinese would react like this. It is natural that they are very against the resolution. But the whole point of the existence of a United Nations Human Rights Commission is to enable member states to discuss human rights," he added.</p>
<p>"Our move is not and should not be seen as an unfriendly action. The commission is not a tribunal. It is fundamental that a dialogue be maintained between nations on human rights. If we did not discuss these matters it would undermine the whole purpose of the commission," Petersen said.</p>
<p>Denmark is to table the resolution later this week at the Commission in Geneva after European Union discord thwarted attempts to agree a joint EU motion.</p>
<p>The wording of the text has not yet been released but Petersen said on Sunday that China should be criticised for its lack of respect for basic human rights such as freedom of assembly and speech.</p>
<p>He said he did not know exactly how much support the motion would gain from other nations but added the United States, Britain and the bulk of EU states backed it.</p>
<p>He declined to comment on what concrete punitive sanctions, if any, China might impose on Denmark in retaliation.</p>
<p>"If Denmark insists on doing this it will end up as the biggest loser," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang said earlier.</p>
<p>"I can say relations will be severely damaged in the political or economic and trade areas," he added.</p>
<p>The Confederation of Danish Industries on Monday issued a statement voicing the concern of its members and pointing out the special vulnerability of several Danish companies with major investments in China.</p>
<p>The Netherlands, which currently holds the rotating EU presidency, has been trying without success to persuade the 15-nation bloc to join forces and sponsor a resolution criticising China.</p>
<p>Although most members support the move, France blocked the resolution and has instead called for dialogue with China rather than confrontation.</p>
