<p>Golden Vale Plc said on Tuesday that difficult market conditions would continue in the second half of the year but a significant restoration of margins was expected in 1997.</p>
<p>The Irish-based food firm said a severance package for former managing director Jim O'Mahony and any charges that may arise from superlevy arrears would also hit second-half profits. It said a net provision of up to three million punts would be required for these exceptional charges in the second half.</p>
<p>Golden Vale said markets for primary dairy products had weakened further since the end of the first half  </p>
<p>The company reported a 49 percent fall in first-half pre-tax profits to 4.05 million punts. "The significant factor affecting the results was an imbalance between weak primary dairy markets and the price paid for milk supplies," it said in a statement.</p>
<p>"While the group expects continuing good performances from its dairy spreads, margarine and catering processed cheese businesses, the dominant influence on the outcome for the second half is likely to be the continuing weak market conditions prevailing for primary dairy products," Golden Vale said.</p>
<p>It said margins in this area were exceptionally tight, but "significant restoration of these margins" was expected in 1997.  </p>
<p>Golden Vale said it was committed to a further net investment of 1.3 million punts in the second half for the would be treated as a normal trading expense, it said.</p>
<p>The company said margins in its milk-related businesses fell to 1.16 percent in the first half from 4.95 percent.</p>
<p>Margins in the retail processed cheese business were below acceptable levels in Ireland, Britain and Europe, Golden Vale said. "The company is in the process of carrying out a detailed analysis of all aspects of this business with a view to increasing margins to acceptable levels," it said.  </p>
<p>The main reason for the fall in margins from the overall processed cheese business was higher input prices and a significant reduction in rates of export refunds on products sold in non-EU markets, Golden Vale said.</p>
<p>The dairy spreads and margarine business had a good first half due to sales price increases, reductions in raw materials prices and a return to profit by the company's 66-percent-owned Dutch subsidiary Velje Margarinefabrik, Golden Vale said.</p>
<p>In the stores trading business, turnover and profits both fell, it said.</p>
