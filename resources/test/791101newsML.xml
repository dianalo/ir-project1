<p>Same-day Cetes closed up 0.70 centavos at 19.20 percent after a choppy session affected by the U.S. long bond and expectations of a rate rise at Tuesday's primary Cetes auction, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The volatility that appeared corresponded to movements related to the U.S. Treasury bond, though some dealers are protecting their posit ahead of the primary auction (on Tuesday)," one analyst said.</p>
<p>The long bond yield reached 6.68 percent before falling back to 6.63 percent at the close, near to Friday's closing level.</p>
<p>Traders also said U.S. indicators due this week were contributing to market jitters. Inflation and retail sales numbers will be published over the next few days and traders are watching for signs of whether the U.S. economy is overheating.</p>
<p>The expectation of across the board rises at Tuesday's primary Cetes auction also contributed to the jumpiness, traders said.</p>
<p>"The wait for the U.S. indicators, the volatility of the long bond and the increase in the amount of paper on offer from the Bank of Mexico (3.6 billion pesos after 3.0 billion in the previous auctions) are generating pressures," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 28-day Cetes reached 18.35 percent at last week's auction.</p>
<p>The Bank of Mexico intervened in the secondary market on Monday through three direct sales and six repurchase agreements for a total of 3.594 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Traders expect liquidity of 144 million pesos to return to the system on Tuesday, as well as an additional 500 million pesos in bank bills.</p>
<p>Overnight rates were unchanged from Friday's close at 20.25 percent. ((--Fatima Escobar, Mexico City newsroom +525 728 9554))</p>
