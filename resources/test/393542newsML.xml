<p>Albanian President Sali Berisha on Friday dismissed demands for his resignation over the crash of pyramid investment funds and headed to the north of the country in his campaign to win back public support.</p>
<p>Europe's poorest nation has been racked by five weeks of protests and riots. Demonstrators demand the right-wing government reimburses them for millions of dollars of lost savings and then step down.</p>
<p>Angry investors blame Berisha and Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi of the ruling Democratic Party for failing to regulate the schemes and not warning hapless investors of their risks.</p>
<p>Berisha has spent a week travelling to several cities across the impoverished nation, publicly admitting he made mistakes and pledging to speed up economic growth.</p>
<p>After holding a series of speeches in the capital Tirana and the towns of Lushnje and Elbasan over the past few days, he went to the northeastern town of Peshkopi on Friday to assure thousands of supporters he would do what he could to help.</p>
<p>"Only the Democratic Party can offer the best solution in this situation," he told a crowd of about 5,000 before adressing some 1,500 party faithfuls in the town's theatre.</p>
<p>He told supporters that a group of 14 Democratic Party MP's which had demanded the resignation of Meksi's government was intent on destabilising the country and wanted to team up with the Socialist opposition.</p>
<p>"To those who suggest a government with the Socialists I say right here: Your red dreams will never come true," he said.</p>
<p>Berisha was scheduled to take his election-style campaign to the northern town of Shkoder on Saturday.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday  Meksi denied that cracks had opened in his ruling Democratic Party and said critics who sought his resignation were welcome to leave the party.</p>
<p>"They have a right to their opinion and they have the right not to stay with us at this difficult moment," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Protesters in the country's south pressed on regardless, with more than 5,000 demonstrators staging their 17th successive evening march in the Adriatic port town of Vlore.</p>
<p>A group of 55 students has gone on hunger strike in the local university building, demanding Meksi's resignation over his handling of the pyramid scheme crisis and for sending riot police to quell violent unrest in the town.</p>
<p>Three demonstrators died and 150 were injured in pitched street battles with police in Vlore last week.</p>
<p>Violence also erupted in the capital Tirana on Thursday when protesters hurled stones at police, who responded by throwing back stones and firing live rounds in the air.</p>
<p>Protesters had been trying to march to central Skanderbeg Square after a peaceful opposition rally in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Meksi said the clashes in Tirana had been the work of left-wing extremists linked to Albania's Stalinist past. "They want to provoke us. They have the books of Lenin, Marx and Enver Hoxha -- they are for the proletarian revolution."</p>
<p>The collapse of five fraudulent pyramid schemes has left tens of thousands of Albanians without a penny. Experts say some $1 to $2 billion was sunk in the schemes, dealing a heavy blow to the market economy that has emerged since the country's hardline Stalinist regime fell in 1990.</p>
<p>The crisis that has engulfed the struggling country has posed the most serious challenge to the five-year rule of Berisha and Meksi, elected in 1992 on promises of speedy development and rising living standards.</p>
