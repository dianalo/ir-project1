<p>A delayed international pact to scrap shipyard subsidies will remain on the shelf for at least five months and may have to be abandoned because the United States has failed to ratify it, an OECD official said on Friday.</p>
<p>The official said he saw only a "50-50" chance that the pact between the United States, European Union, Japan, South Korea and Norway would ever be enacted. He said signatories might run out of patience if Washington did not act soon on the deal, which is already three months overdue for implementation.</p>
<p>"At this stage everybody has said they are willing to wait a few months, at least until March," the official said. But, he added, "there is clearly frustration."</p>
<p>He was speaking after two days of talks at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in which signatories urged each other not to start a new shipbuilding subsidy war.</p>
<p>The pact aims to stamp out most of the government subsidies and predatory pricing blamed for a lengthy shipbuilding slump.</p>
<p>Washington is the only capital which has not ratified the so-called Shipbuilding Trade Agreement Act as it stands. Although the Clinton administration supports the pact, it has been blocked by Congressional attempts to amend it.</p>
<p>The OECD, which brokered the accord, said the parties had agreed to meet again in March to receive a report by the United States on how the prospects for ratification were looking then.</p>
<p>The meeting would decide on "further action, if any, to be taken," an OECD statement said.</p>
<p>The OECD official said none of the delegations at the meeting had expected much progress. "It was a very satisfactory outcome given the circumstances," the official said.</p>
<p>The OECD warned that while the agreement was being held up, the shipbuilding industry was speeding towards even greater competition, with capacity growing faster than demand.</p>
<p>Delegates at the meeting had urged that "all signatories would refrain from actions aimed at creating unilateral advantages," the OECD said.</p>
<p>Washington has been roundly criticised for delaying the pact, which covers 80 percent of the world's shipyard capacity. The U.S. shipbuilding industry says it has not had time to adjust to the collapse of military business after the Cold War.</p>
<p>U.S. approval was held up in June when the House of Representatives passed an amendment delaying U.S. implementation to January 1999. Then a Senate initiative to exclude the amendment ran out of time before Congress adjourned.</p>
<p>Under the agreement the United States would phase out some of its federally-backed loan guarantees to shipbuilders.</p>
<p>Virginia Republican Representative Herbert Bateman, author of the House amendment, has said the delay is needed to match clauses that other countries negotiated into the agreement.</p>
<p>The amendment also seeks to preserve the politically sensitive U.S. Jones Act, which prohibits cargo shipment between U.S. ports in foreign-built ships. The Clinton administration has said the Jones Act exemption was implicit in the agreement.</p>
<p>The OECD official said the other parties would "walk away" from the deal if the Jones Act were not abandoned.</p>
