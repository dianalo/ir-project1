<p>China's parliament, the National People's Congress, approved on Friday the budget for 1997.</p>
<p>However, some 10 percent of the 2,720 deputies did not vote for the budget, with 126 voting no and 122 abstaining while 30 did not vote.  </p>
<p>The budget revealed a record debt issue and higher defence spending for 1997.</p>
<p>China aims to cut its budget deficit by 7.2 percent to 57.0 billion yuan ($6.87 billion) in 1997 from 61.442 billion last year, Finance Minister Liu Zhongli said last week.</p>
<p>Total revenues were expected to be 839.794 billion yuan ($101.18 billion) this year, an increase of 14 percent, while expenditures were set at 896.794 billion yuan ($108.047 billion), up by 13.3 percent.</p>
<p>However, Liu said China would miss its target to balance its books by the end of the century.</p>
<p>Western diplomats say the deficit is manageable, equal to about 0.77 percent of estimated total GDP this year and down from 0.99 percent last year.</p>
