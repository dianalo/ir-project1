<p>Canadian T-bills opened firmer on Wednesday amid strong demand for a dwindling supply of T-bills, with dealers playing down the possibility of a near- term Bank of Canada rate cut.</p>
<p>"There's basically a lot of cash with no real place to put it. That's the only thing driving things here. There is a camp out there thinking the Bank of Canada is going to move, but I can't see that happening with the dollar weakening off the way it is," said one T-bill trader.</p>
<p>Canada's three-month when-issued T-bill firmed to yield 2.72 percent from 2.75 percent at Tuesday's close.  </p>
<p>"In this case it's really a lack of supply and it's not like the Bank automatically follows the rally in bills every time," said a second trader.</p>
<p>Canadian T-bills rallied sharply Tuesday amid strong foreign buying, leading some analysts to comment that the market was pricing in another Bank of Canada rate cut.</p>
<p>But T-bill traders said another move by the bank in the near term was unlikely unless the Canadian dollar strengthened. The currency has weakened since the last cut, bringing the Bank of Canada's monetary conditions index to some of its lowest levels ever.  </p>
<p>Supply in the Canadian market remained tight with the Bank of Canada Tuesday auctioning a lower than average C$4.8 billion of bills, even as C$7.8 billion of T-bills came due. The Bank of Canada this morning will auction C$1.5 billion seven-day T-bills.</p>
<p>In other prices, the six-month when-issued bill firmed to yield 2.86 percent from 2.90 percent. The one-year when-issued bill firmed to yield 3.18 percent from 3.22 percent.</p>
<p>The call loan or overnight lending rate traded at 3.0 percent, the center of the Bank of Canada's 2.75-3.25 percent target range, dealers said.</p>
