<p>Doctors said on Friday they may have found a new explanation for back pain -- nerves may be growing too far into the discs between the vertebrae.</p>
<p>Anthony Freemont at the University of Manchester and colleagues at the Hospitalier Universitaire in Tours, France, found many people who complained of back pain had unusual nerve growth in their backs.</p>
<p>They looked at disc tissue that had been removed from people with chonic back pain, and compared it to tissue taken from the cadavers of people who had not complained of back pain.</p>
<p>The discs are gelatinous cushions in between each vertebra, and are surrounded by a tough, fibrous tissue called the annulus fibrosis.</p>
<p>Normally, nerves from the discs grow no deeper than the outer third of the annulus fibrosis. They found in the cadavers, the nerves generally went no further than the middle-third.</p>
<p>But in 38 sufferers of back pain, 46 percent showed nerve growth into the inner third of the annulus fibrosis. In 22 percent of cases it went right inside the disc.</p>
<p>"Our findings strongly implicate these fibrils in the pathogenesis of chronic low back pain," Freemont's group wrote in a report for the Lancet medical journal.</p>
<p>Furthermore, these nerves were producing "substance P", a peptide associated with pain.</p>
<p>In some cases there were blood vessels in there, too, indicating that perhaps the nerves and blood supply were part of some sort of healing process after an injury.</p>
<p>But sometimes there were just isolated nerve fibrils that went deep into the discs, and they were seen only in those complaining of back pain.</p>
<p>Freemont suggested that researchers look for a way to block this abnormal nerve growth, or to at least block the pain transmissions.</p>
