<p>U.S. Northwest spot power moved lower on Friday, while prices rose in the Southwest amid restrictions on the Pacific Intertie, the major power lines linking the two regions, trade sources said.</p>
<p>"You won't be able to move power south, so COB (California-Oregon border) and MidC (Mid-Columbia), are down a bit," said one trader.</p>
<p>Mid-Columbia for Monday was last quoted $16.00-16.50 per megawatt hour (MWh), compared with $16.00-17.00 on Thursday.</p>
<p>COB for Monday was quoted $19.00-20.00 per MWh, down from $19.50-20.00 on Thursday.</p>
<p>In the Southwest, Palo Verde for Monday was trading near $25.00-26.00, up from $21.00-22.00 per MWh on Thursday. Some sources cited PV offers as high at $30.00 for Monday.</p>
<p>As previously reported, the 3,200 megawatt DC intertie, which has been de-rated to 2,000 MW since a major power outage on August 10, will be subject to further curtailments through October 20, mainly for voltage support studies.</p>
<p>Also, the 4,800 MW AC segment of the Intertie, limited to 3,200 MW since August 10, will be restricted to 2,000 MW during daytime hours on Monday and Tuesday and to 2,800 on Wednesday through Friday.</p>
<p>Traders also cited outages at coal-fired plants in the Southwest as helping to tighten regional supplies.</p>
<p>Public Service Co of New Mexico has a 361 MW unit down at its San Juan coal-fired unit, while a second 350 MW unit is at 50 percent capacity and is expected to be shut over the weekend for repairs.</p>
<p>Public Service Co of Colorado's 262 MW Hayden coal-fired unit is also shut for maintenance work and is expected to restart sometime next week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Southern California Edison Co said Thursday that the 1,080 MW unit 2 at the San Onofre nuclear plant, which has been down since Sep 24, will not restart until the end of next week.</p>
<p>Some trade sources also said forecasts for above-normal temperatures in the Southwest added to the bullish tone for power prices.</p>
<p>But a Tucson trader said peak temperatures of around 95 degrees are now only being seen for a few afternoon hours, so loads are still moderate.</p>
