<p>President Clinton on Monday vetoed an $8.6 billion emergency money bill providing disaster relief funds for 35 flood-stricken states because it included unrelated Republican policies he strongly opposed.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats vowed to keep the Senate in session all night on Tuesday unless Congress passed the disaster relief in a form the president can sign into law.</p>
<p>In his veto message Clinton said Congress loaded the measure with unacceptable provisions "despite the obvious and urgent need to speed critical relief" to people in the Dakotas, Minnesota, California and 31 other states ravaged by floods and other natural disasters.</p>
<p>North and South Dakota were especially hard-hit.</p>
<p>"The time has come to stop playing politics with the lives of Americans in need and to send me a clean bill that I can and will sign the moment in reaches my desk," Clinton said in announcing his refusal to sign the bill.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, and 15 others divided the hours between 6 p.m. EDT Tuesday and 9 a.m. EDT Wednesday to speak on the Senate floor. "We don't know what else to do at this point to convince Republicans that this is an emergency," Daschle said.</p>
<p>House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Republican leaders will work to get relief to those in need, but did not explain how this would occur. "The president came out against disaster relief and in favour of government shutdowns," the Georgia Republican said in a written statement.</p>
<p>The bill provided $5.4 billion for disaster assistance, including $89 million for House Speaker Newt Gingrich's home state of Georgia and $24 million for Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott's state of Mississippi.</p>
<p>It also included $1.9 billion to pay for military operations in Bosnia and the Persian Gulf and $262 million for feeding poor women and their children, for education and for a new transportation system at Yosemite National Park. The rest of the money was earmarked for highway construction, veteran's benefits and other purposes.</p>
<p>But it also included a Republican rider that would guarantee federal agencies funding at the 1997 level if the Republican-led Congress and the Democratic White House failed to agree on funding by the Oct. 1 start of the fiscal year.</p>
<p>The White House regarded this as a backdoor strategem that would enable Republicans to prevail in spending disputes.</p>
<p>North Dakota Gov. Ed Shafer, a Republican, took issue with Clinton.</p>
<p>"The fact that he actually vetoed this bill, when he himself opposes shutting the government down and when he came to our state and promised to put politics aside to support strong flexible relief, is discouraging," Shafer said.</p>
<p>Another provision Clinton refused to accept would block the use of sampling to try to get a better fix on traditionally undercounted minorities in the 2000 census. Since minorities tend to vote Democratic and congressional districts are drawn by population, this also has partisan implications.</p>
<p>Clinton objected to language in the bill he said would promote the paving of unimproved roads in sensitive areas of national parks.</p>
<p>"I urge Congress to remove these extraneous provisions and to send me a straightforward disaster relief bill that I can sign promptly so that we can help hard-hit American families and businesses as they struggle to rebuild," he said.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Clinton received the disaster relief bill from Congress at 1:50 p.m. EDT and vetoed it at 2:09 p.m. The measure was on its way back to Capitol Hill at 2:18 p.m.," he said.</p>
<p>Congress could overturn Clinton's veto by mustering a two-thirds majority in both the Senate and the House, but since the House failed to pass the bill by that big a margin the first time around a veto override seemed improbable.</p>
