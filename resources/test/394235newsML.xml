<headline>Apple says Ellen Hancock not leaving.</headline>

<p>Apple Computer Inc., squelching speculation in trade magazines, said Friday its chief technical officer, Ellen Hancock, does not plan to leave the company.</p>
<p>"We did in fact speak with her at (the) MacWorld (trade show) in Tokyo and she said she has no plans to leave," said Apple spokeswoman Katie Cotton.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the online version of trade magazine PC Week reported that Hancock -- who oversees Apple's research and development -- was negotiating a severance package in preparation for handing in her resignation. It cited unidentified sources.</p>
<p>Hancock, who was still in Japan, could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Since a horde of key executives began leaving Apple three weeks ago, speculation has swirled about who in the executive suite would leave next.</p>
<p>Hancock has been a favourite candidate, analysts said, because Chairman Gilbert Amelio recently took over her chief responsibility -- overseeing an effort to revamp the fundamental software of the Macintosh by merging it with software technology from recently purchased Next Software Inc.</p>
<p>Hancock has said she has been unhappy about losing the role, but said she understands Amelio's decision and would work with him.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Marco Landi, the well-regarded executive vice president of sales, resigned.</p>
<p>The week before, Heidi Roizen, the liaison between Apple and software companies, quit.</p>
<p>Satjiv Chahil -- the marketing executive who got Hollywood to give starring roles to Apple's portable computers in last summer's blockbusters -- also left last week.</p>
<p>With Landi's resignation, none of Apple's top executives -- Hancock, Amelio, Chief Financial Officer Fred Anderson and Chief Administrative Officer George Scalise -- has been at Apple for more than 13 months. They joined Apple shortly after Amelio replaced Michael Spindler as CEO in February 1996.</p>
