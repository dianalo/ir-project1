<p>A former New York broker and his father agreed to pay $673,196 in penalties to settle charges of manipulation and fraud involving shares of Health Professionals Inc., the Securities and Exchange Commission said.</p>
<p>The broker, Jeffrey Weissman, 32, a former registered representative of D.H. Blair &amp; Co., and a former chairman and chief executive of A.R. Baron &amp; Co. Inc., allegedly manipulated Health Professionals' stock for three periods between October 1991 and June 1993, the SEC said.</p>
<p>The father, Martin Weissman, 60, former chairman of Health Professionals, allegedly sold 40,000 shares of the company in two trades, making profits of $161,250, the agency said.</p>
<p>He allegedly sold the shares in the fall of 1991 in two stages, 15,000 when the price had risen to $13.75 from a low of $11.50 and 25,000 when it further rose to $17. The SEC alleged "he knew or should have known" that he was selling at a price that his son had artificially inflated.</p>
<p>The SEC alleged that Jeffrey Weissman's manipulation inflated Health Professional's stock to as high as $21 from late October to mid-November 1991.</p>
<p>Health Professionals is a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,-based operator of health care delivery and clinical research systems specialising in the AIDs and HIV-related areas. The company, which is not accused in the case, had no immediate comment.</p>
<p>Without admitting denying guilt, the elder Weissman, who was chairman of Health Professionals from its founding in the 1970s until May 1992, agreed to forfeit the alleged illegal profits and pay interest of of $61,946.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Weissman agreed to return $350,000 of alleged profits from the manipulation and pay a civil penalty of $100,000. The younger Weissman, who suffered severe head injuries from a motorcyle accident in 1993, agreed to be barred permanently from the securities industry. He neither denied nor admitted any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Both father and son agreed not to violate securities laws in the future. They could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>In a related proceeding, three former brokers at D.H. Blair and A.R. Baron settled SEC charges of fraud, manipulation of Health Professionals stock and violating customer credit rules.</p>
<p>Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Robert Gilbert, 30, and Alan Weissman, 28, agreed to be suspended from the securities industry for three years. Daniel Felter, 29, agreed to be suspended for one year.</p>
<p>They agreed to pay penalties totalling $62,000.</p>
<p>In May, the SEC charged A.R. Baron with using fraudulent sales practices involving more than $17 million in securities. Its assets are currently under control of a court-appointed trustee.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from the three former brokers and D.H. Blair.</p>
