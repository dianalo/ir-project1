<p>A Lebanese military prosecutor on Thursday demanded up to 10 years jail for four Lebanese men charged with collaborating with Israel, judicial sources said.</p>
<p>Lebanon and Israel are in a state of war despite more than five years of on-again off-again peace talks between them. Lebanese law forbids citizens from contacting or dealing with the Jewish state.</p>
<p>The sources said prosecutor Nasri Lahoud charged Antoine Boulos, 52, Tony Yammine, 48, Maroun Yaghi, 39, and Elias Qlait, 40, with "contacting the enemy and entering its country without prior permission from the (Lebanese) state".</p>
<p>The four men, all of whom are in custody, were also charged with "conducting commerical deals with people residing in Israel".</p>
<p>No date has been set for the trial.</p>
<p>Last week, a military investigating judge demanded up to 10 years jail for 87 people for allegedly collaborating with Israel. All the suspects were charged in absentia as they are residents of Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone.</p>
<p>Some 1,000 Israeli troops and 3,000 allied Lebanese militiamen occupy the border zone in south Lebanon to ward off guerrilla raids on northern Israel.</p>
