<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn said on Wednesday that following the European Commission's recommendation to begin EU accession talks with six countries, Hungary should become a full EU member by 2000.</p>
<p>"I find it a well-founded hope that the 15 member countries will support Hungary's application and by 2000 Hungary will become a member of the European Union," Horn told a conference of Hungarian ambassadors.</p>
<p>"We can take (2000) as a target and we can present this in the course of the (accession) negotiations."</p>
<p>The European Commission on Wednesday officially published its recommendations that Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Estonia and Slovenia should be invited to begin EU membership talks along with Cyprus next year.</p>
<p>Accession talks with prospective new members are expected to begin early in 1998 and to last two years before the ratification process begins.</p>
<p>EU officials have said the process of getting EU enlargement past the parliaments of the 15 member countries and the applicant countries could take until 2002 but Horn said he believed Hungary's case will be among the strongest and should be approved before other less deserving cases.</p>
<p>"I don't say we are in competition with other applicant states but...the decision should be not be made on a subjective basis but really based on the achievements of the countries," he said.</p>
<p>"And Hungary's achievements are really outstanding."</p>
<p>One of the bright stars in the eyes of the Commission, Hungary is seen as having successfully transposed the EU's laws in preparation for membership. It is judged well-placed to match up to competition in the medium term if it continues its efforts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are problems. The 10.2 million Hungarians have a GDP per head equal to only 37 percent of the EU average. After GDP fell nearly 20 percent between 1989 and 1993, the economy has started to grow, albeit at a weak pace, the Commission says.</p>
<p>There are also large problems in the area of the environment, it says.</p>
<p>The Commission's proposal will not be the last word on who will negotiate EU entry as it could be overturned by EU governments, which have different national interests at stake.</p>
<p>A final decision will be taken by EU leaders at their Luxembourg summit in December.</p>
