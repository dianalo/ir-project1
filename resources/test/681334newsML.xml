<p>Albania's three main political parties signed an agreement on Monday pledging to ensure free and fair elections on Sunday and to work together for stable government after the ballot, a Roman Catholic peace group said.</p>
<p>The four-point accord, signed at the Sant'Egidio Community in Rome, also recognised the need for a coalition government after Sunday's vote and said the opposition would be entitled to occupy key supervisory posts in parliament.  </p>
<p>The agreement was signed by the chairman of President Sali Berisha's Democratic Party, Tritan Shehu, the leader of the main opposition Socialist Party, Fatos Nano, and Social Democratic Party leader Skender Gjinushi.</p>
<p>The right-wing Democratic Party is defending a huge parliamentary majority won in a general election last year which both Albania's opposition and Western observers denounced as unfair.</p>
<p>A rebellion in the south of the country forced Berisha in March to agree to a national unity government led by the Socialists in the run-up to early elections. A 7,000-strong multinational peacekeeping force has also been deployed in the former communist Balkan state.</p>
<p>Monday's accord said a solution to Albania's crisis would depend on the free and fair conduct of Sunday's ballot.</p>
