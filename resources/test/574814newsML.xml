<p>The sand is deep, white and fine, the kind coveted at oceanside resorts. But in Algeria's Hamada desert it is just another hardship for the Western Sahara refugees.</p>
<p>Sand whirls around 12-year-old Farsa as she struggles to drag a plastic water jug to her tent and she squints against the glaring reflection of desert sun.</p>
<p>Farsa points to the western horizon and says she wants to go there, to her parents' homeland, where there is some green and ocean and enough food.</p>
<p>Her family, among the tens of thousands of refugees who fled the former Spanish colony as the Moroccans moved in, has lived in one of the world's most desolate and inhospitable spots for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>Housed in four sprawling camps based in Rabuni in southwest Algeria, they have endured harsh conditions that have created a generation of malnourished, diseased and undereducated children.</p>
<p>Many of the refugees have stayed for one reason -- their dream of an independent homeland.</p>
<p>A visit to the camps last month by United Nations special envoy James Baker, sent to unblock the peace process in the region, reawakened the refugees' dormant hopes.</p>
<p>LIBERTY THE MOST IMPORTANT THING</p>
<p>"I think no one of us has ever really lost the hope that one day we can return. If we lost that we would not be able to survive," Majeena, who left Western Sahara when she was five and grew up in the camps, told Reuters.</p>
<p>She now studies accounting at university in Geneva and her father lives in Moroccan-controlled Western Sahara, but she always comes back to the camps, the only home she's ever known.</p>
<p>"The most important thing for me is my liberty. Some Sahrawi live in occupied territory and have money and things we don't have, but I'd rather live here with my freedom," Majeena said.</p>
<p>Baker was met by near-hysteria in the Smara camp where almost the entire population of 40,000 turned out to greet him with women ululating, children cheering, older men holding banners, soldiers at attention and even a small military band.</p>
<p>"Mr Baker, please, please help us, we want our independence," shouted 27-year-old Sultana in perfect English.</p>
<p>A security guard for the former U.S. secretary of state said he had never seen such pandemonium.</p>
<p>But some of the refugees, having been disappointed many times before, passed beyond the niceties of protocol.</p>
<p>"That man Baker has to understand us. We hope he will be fair. We have sacrificed a lot, our friends, sons, and we want to have independence," Embarka Khalil, 60 and living in a dingy tent with few personal touches, told Reuters before his visit.</p>
<p>Her husband was killed in the 15-year war Polisario, the Sahrawi independence movement, fought against Morocco and her son is a prisoner of war in Morocco. "This is all I have. I may never see my home again," she said as tears filled her eyes.</p>
<p>She and many of the estimated 170,000 refugees see only two paths: the one mapped out by Baker or a return to war.</p>
<p>A referendum on independence promised by the United Nations in 1991 has failed to materialise and the refugees, isolated in their desert wasteland, feel the world has forgotten them.</p>
<p>POLISARIO KEEPS TROOPS COMBAT-READY</p>
<p>While not eager to return to war, Polisario has kept troops trained with the desert warfare skills of their nomadic ancestors, sending boys to the front with Morocco at age 18, and maintaining a supply of arms and tanks.</p>
<p>They also keep tight controls on the camps, keeping any signs of permanence to a minimum -- there is not even a mosque -- and fuelling the desire for independence with tales of horror in the Morocco-controlled or "occupied" territory.</p>
<p>Polisario's critics have accused the group of intimidating some refugees into staying in the squalid camps to keep pressure on the international community.</p>
<p>Once shunned as a Marxist revolutionaries, the Arab Sahara Democratic Republic proclaimed by Polisario is recognised by 72 countries, mostly in Africa, South America and Asia, and gets arms and ammunition from Algeria.</p>
<p>It has a flag, a parliament of sorts and ministries for information, foreign affairs and defence among others.</p>
<p>Women elected by American-style town meetings run cooperative groups within the camps to distribute food, clothes, housing, health and education.</p>
<p>They work in collectives without pay and depend on aid from international groups.</p>
<p>One teenager showed a visitor a decrepit truck he was fixing up, glowing with pride as he explained how he earned money to buy paint.</p>
<p>REFUGEE CHILDREN SUFFER FROM MALNUTRITION</p>
<p>The refugees have learned to survive on very little, but aid workers say 15 to 20 percent of the children suffer severe malnutrition. Others are stunted by inadequate iron and protein intake and rampant dysentery from contaminated water.</p>
<p>The population has a high level of eye disease because of sandstorms and glare, and thyroid problems.</p>
<p>"These have these diseases only because they are refugees and living in these difficult conditions. These are not native to the population," said a Spanish nurse who works at one of the camp hospitals.</p>
<p>A report by U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said water supplies at the camps, usually from shallow wells drawing on the same water table that the latrines empty into, were among the worst in the world.</p>
<p>"I've lost sympathy for the Polisario after seeing how they've let their people waste away in refugee camps," said one U.N. worker who did not want to be named.</p>
<p>Diplomats in the region say privately that the international community is eager to resolve the conflict, in part because of the plight of the refugees, but also because it is an irritant in a sensitive region at NATO's southern flank.</p>
<p>They see the solution as some sort of federal state for Western Sahara within Morocco rather than full independence.</p>
<p>But for desert survivors like the Sahrawi refugees, there is only one route home.</p>
<p>"If we return to our land, it will be with dignity," Khalil said. "We would rather live here in these hard conditions than there with oppression and colonisation."</p>
