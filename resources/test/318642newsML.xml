<text>
<p>In overnight commodity markets, copper prices bounced in London despite an expected rise in copper stocks on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Other metals prices followed copper.</p>
<p>Gold futures ended slightly lower on a strong dollar, but bullion prices were steady to a touch firmer as the market consolidates after last week's big fall.</p>
<p>Wheat prices fell in Chicago after the Australian Wheat Board raised its crop estimate.</p>
<p>Oil prices fell on futures expiry activity.</p>
<p>The CRB index closed down 0.39 points at 242.02.</p>
<p>METALS</p>
<p>Copper prices bounced smartly after a weak start on Monday, setting the pace for the rest of the metals on the London Metal Exchange (LME), traders said.</p>
<p>Other beneficiaries of the buying interest were zinc, which hit a fresh 23-month high, and aluminium, he added.</p>
<p>Benchmark three-months copper ended the afternoon kerb at $2,270 per tonne, up $22 from Friday. Copper was still consolidating above $2,230 support after recent strong gains, but eventually prices would likely re-challenge the key $2,290 resistance level, which has stalled rallies twice in the past week.</p>
<p>Near term direction was dependent on Tuesday's LME stocks, expected by some traders to rise by 6,000-7,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Zinc charged to a fresh 23-month high of $1,153 per tonne. It ended at $1,150, up $13 from Friday. Aluminium also made upside progress from an indifferent start to the day, finishing the kerb $17 stronger at $1,624.</p>
<p>But it failed to hurdle stiff resistance around $1,625 for the fourth time in a week.</p>
<p>GOLD</p>
<p>New York precious metals futures ended lower Monday, as the U.S. dollar surged to new 31-month highs against the mark and new 46 month highs against yen, but trade was dampened by the US Martin Luther King holiday which closed government offices and banks.</p>
<p>COMEX February gold ended down $1.80 an ounce at $354.60, after seeing a session low at $353.40, just above the contract low at $352.60 seen last week.</p>
<p>Spot gold in the bullion market ended quoted $353.30/80, compared to the London Monday afternoon fix at $353.10 and the New York close Friday at $355.30/80.</p>
<p>Gold appeared to be consolidating again just above $350 an ounce, after sliding to three year lows in the first week of 1997, analysts said.</p>
<p>OIL</p>
<p>U.S. cash crudes dropped off in volatile activity Monday afternoon as many market players began rolling over their February contracts ahead of Tuesday's NYMEX expiry, traders said.</p>
<p>February West Texas Intermediate was trading around $25.05-15 a barrel, down some 50 cents from this morning and 30 cents from late Friday's cash market.</p>
<p>Grade activity was light on this partial U.S. holiday in commemoration of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The NYMEX is open for a regular session, but some traders took a long weekend.</p>
<p>WHEAT</p>
<p>CBOT wheat futures closed lower on a crop estimate released by the Australian Wheat Board (AWB), traders said.</p>
<p>"The Australian Wheat Board (AWB) estimate hit the wheat and commercials sold it," said Vic Lespinasse of Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>The AWB early Monday pegged the 1996-97 AWB wheat crop at 22.0 million tonnes, above the previous estimate for 21.5 million tonnes. Also diminished concerns about winterkill in the U.S. winter wheat areas weighed on the market, they said.</p>
<p>Friday's Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commitments of Traders report provided little direction. The CFTC said as of January 14 funds were long wheat 41 million bushels and short 51 million. Wheat closed two to six cents per bushel lower, with March down three at $3.77-1/2 a bushel.</p>
<p>In London, IPE Brent crude futures closed almost unchanged on Monday after a day of consolidation following hefty losses last week, dealers said. March Brent ended the session four cents up at $22.58 a barrel.  </p>
