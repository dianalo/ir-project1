<p>The FTSE 100 index shed more of its recent gains on Wednesday but finished off the day's worst levels despite a sharp early sell-off in New York.</p>
<p>A lack of fresh domestic company and economic news helped to subdue activity and lacklustre UK stocks took their lead from an overnight sell-off across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index finished 28.8 points lower at 4,028.4 in moderate volume of 630 million shares. Losers outweighed gainers by roughly three-to-one.</p>
<p>"The market definitely turned today," said one dealer. "We were getting a little too blase about going up 20-points a day."</p>
