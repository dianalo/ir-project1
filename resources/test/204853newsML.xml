<p>Asian airlines will announce fare hikes soon in line with the three percent recommended by the world airlines body IATA after details are settled between individual carriers, industry sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>So far no Asian airline has announced an increase to international passenger fares, with most indicating that they are considering fare hikes.</p>
<p>"Asian airlines are not doing anything yet because they have not received the details from IATA of last week's meeting," one airline source said.</p>
<p>The 251-member International Air Transport Association (IATA) proposed a global three percent passenger fare increase on November 15 to make up for a rise of over 40 percent in fuel costs this year.</p>
<p>Jet fuel prices in Singapore, a benchmark for regional markets, averaged $27.75 per barrel for the year to date, up 22 percent from the 1995 average of $22.80. Fuel makes up about 10 percent of airline costs.  </p>
<p>In a statement, Singapore Airlines said it "will soon be announcing fare increases in line with other carriers. We are unable to provide details at this stage, but will do so as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Qantas Airways Ltd announced on Tuesday it would raise domestic passenger fares by 2.5 percent on Wednesday. A company spokeswoman said she could not say when or if international passenger fares would be increased.</p>
<p>Hong Kong flag carrier Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd said it was considering IATA's proposal to raise fares.</p>
<p>"Airlines want to make sure major carriers are in line with them before they announce increases," another industry source said.</p>
<p>The process of raising fares is not straightforward as it involves getting government approval and making sure that rival airlines make similar revisions, the industry sources said.</p>
<p>The hikes to fares are expected to be immediately felt in premier classes as their ticket prices are already at published rates, unlike economy fares.</p>
<p>Market economy fares are currently between 30 and 40 percent below published fares due to intense competition and are not likely to be revised upward immediately, one source said.  </p>
<p>As a result, Asian airlines were earlier reluctant to raise fares, he said.</p>
