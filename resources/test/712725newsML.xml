<p>Czech inflation rebounded in June, partly due to the crown's sharp fall, and analysts saw little hope for a quick return to the earlier downtrend even though the central bank pronounced itself pleased by the figures.</p>
<p>The Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) released data on Tuesday showing prices jumped 1.2 percent month-on-month in June, forcing the year-on-year inflation rate up to 6.8 percent from May's post-communist low of 6.3 percent.</p>
<p>The sliding average inflation figure, which uses 1993 as a base, edged down to 7.9 percent from 8.0 percent in May, and was down from 8.6 percent in May 1996.</p>
<p>The figures were slightly above market expectations and a Reuters survey of economists on Monday predicted a 0.9 percent monthly increase.</p>
<p>Analysts said much of the rise in the monthly rate was, as expected, due to a crisis in the crown in May and June when the currency fell to record lows before the central bank was forced to float it.</p>
<p>"I think that out of the 1.2 percent increase, about one third is due to the depreciation of the crown," Martin Kupka, an economist at Patria Finance, told Reuters. "I think we can expect relatively high inflation in July...There will still be some effect on prices next month, but it will be much less," he added.</p>
<p>The Czech crown came under attack at the end of May as speculators targeted the currency which they believed to be overvalued, and the ruling coalition government teetered near a possible collapse.</p>
<p>The central bank was forced on May 27 to float the currency and abandon its 15 percent fluctuation band within which it fixed the currency against a mark/dollar peg.</p>
<p>Czech National Bank (CNB) board member Jiri Pospisil told Reuters that the June inflation was lower than the CNB had expected, giving the central bank room to lower interest rates carefully.</p>
<p>He added that the CNB expected inflation to accelerate to just over 10 percent by the end of the year after deregulation of several prices bit. "The figures for June were better than we expected and make possible a further lowering of interest rates," Pospisil said.</p>
<p>The central bank would continue its cautious approach to lowering rates, which it jacked up to defend the crown, reacting to the situation on the market.</p>
<p>The CSU said foodstuffs, tobacco and beverages rose 2.0 percent in June, month-on-month, accounting for some 53 percent of the overall rise. Household goods and leisure prices, heavily influenced by the weakening of the crown, also recorded above average increases in June.</p>
<p>Martin Hlusek of Expanida Finance said he expected inflation for the year to be between 8.5 and 9.0 percent. "This applies only in the case that there is no radical pressure on wage growth, or a large deviation in the crown rate," he said.</p>
<p>The crown itself was steady on Tuesday with dealers saying the market had already built in the expected high June figure.</p>
<p>The central bank fixed the crown at 32.474 to the dollar and 18.496 to the mark, little changed from the market opening.</p>
<p>Analysts also said July inflation would jump due to a loosening of housing rents and energy prices by an average of 50 percent and 15 percent respectively, effective July 1.</p>
<p>Many Czechs still live in flats with artificially low rents and with energy bills subsidised by industrial users.</p>
<p>Pospisil, who is the executive director of the CNB's monetary division, said the central bank expected July's monthly inflation to top two percent. "December (year-on-year inflation) growth will be slightly higher than 10 percent," he said, adding that the sliding average was seen at slightly under 10 percent.</p>
<p>Year-end 1996 inflation was 8.6 percent, year-on-year, while the sliding average for the year was 8.8 percent.</p>
