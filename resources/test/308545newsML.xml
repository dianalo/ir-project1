<p>Telefonia Inalambrica del Norte (Telinor) will soon unveil its short-term strategy to enter the local telephone market in the north of the country, a company official said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We're in the last stages, in parallel negotiations with various companies.  When things come together, we can make a decision and we expect soon to have news," commercial director and Telinor spokesman Reynaldo Villareal told Reuters.</p>
<p>He declined to elaborate on the country of origin or other details of the potential Telinor partners.</p>
<p>Telinor is the only telephone company, besides former monopoly Telefonos Mexicanos (Telmex), to be granted a concession to operate local phone networks nationwide. Key Telinor associates include Lorenzo Zambrano, director general and president of Cementos Mexicanos, and federal senator Alberto Santos de Hoyos, who sold bakery goods company Gamesa a few years ago.</p>
<p>Telinor plans to invest $1 billion in the next five years to install two million new telephone lines in Mexico with fixed wireless technology, in which isolated communities will be wired to one radio transmitter that is in communication with the Telinor network.</p>
