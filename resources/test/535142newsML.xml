<p>The Russian government will consider plans next month to restructure the debts of the 15 biggest corporate tax debtors, requiring companies to issue bonds or shares to be held by the government while the tax is paid off, Privatisation Minister Alfred Kokh said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Kokh as saying an extraordinary tax commission would meet at the end of May to review the plans.</p>
<p>Companies on the list include major oil companies such as Yuganskneftegaz, subsidiaries of Norilsk Nickel, one of the world's biggest producers of non-ferrous metals, the world's largest gas company Gazprom, and Russia's biggest carmaker AvtoVAZ.</p>
<p>"Immediately after considering this question at the commission meeting, concrete work on restructuring will start," Interfax said.</p>
<p>The Temporary Special Commission for Improving Budget Discipline (VChK) was set up last October by President Boris Yeltsin to increase tax collection.</p>
<p>It quickly upset Russia's industrial establishment and regional leaders by threatening to instigate bankruptcy proceedings against the biggest debtors, but so far only one, a refinery, has actually been declared bankrupt.</p>
<p>A few companies, including an oil refinery and an alumina plant, have been put into receivership, but in higher profile cases, such as carmaker Moskvich and truckmaker KamAZ, local governments succeeded in fending off the bankruptcy threats.</p>
<p>The government has since drawn up two possibilities for the biggest debtors. One requires them to issue bonds, guaranteed by their assets, to the government, while paying off the tax debt over two years and fines on the debt over five years.</p>
<p>An alternative would require companies to transfer a majority stake of 50 percent plus one share to the government in trust. This often would require a new share issue.</p>
<p>The company then has five years to pay off the tax debt and 10 years to pay off the fines. But if it falls behind on the payments schedule, the shares become government property and may be sold.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy proceedings will be instigated if the companies fail to adopt one of these schemes, the government has said.</p>
<p>According to Interfax, Kokh, who is also deputy prime minister, said that most of the companies on the list would opt for bonds. But AvtoVAZ was likely to transfer a majority shares stake to the government.</p>
<p>Norilsk Nickel said last week it intended to double the capital of its flagship plant and transfer a majority stake to the government.</p>
<p>Tax revenues have deteriorated since the commission was set up and the State Tax Service said first quarter tax revenues were 69 percent of target.</p>
<p>As a result the government is unable to pay its bills, and wages and pensions are going unpaid.</p>
<p>The dismal tax performance has led the International Monetary Fund to effectively suspend a $10 billion loan to Russia, while senior ministers have warned that the government could cease to function properly.</p>
