<p>A second Turkish minister from the conservative wing of the Islamist-led coalition said on Saturday he was resigning in a row over implementation of anti-Islamist military demands, an aide to the minister said.</p>
<p>"He will hand in his resignation to the Prime Minister shortly," an aide to Health Minister Yildirim Aktuna told Reuters.  </p>
<p>State-run Anatolian news agency earlier quoted Trade and Industry Minister Yalim Erez as saying he would hand in his resignation to Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.</p>
<p>Aktuna and Erez are both members of the True Path Party of Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller.</p>
<p>The two had already expressed open opposition to Erbakan's Welfare Party for stalling on military demands for a crackdown on religious activism.</p>
<p>The National Security Council, chaired by President Suleyman Demirel, was to meet later on Saturday for talks expected to focus on army orders to restrict religious education, penalise Islamist dress and move against Islamist business.</p>
