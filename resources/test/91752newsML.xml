<headline>Great Lakes sees lower Q3, year earnings.</headline>

<p>Great Lakes Chemical Corp said Wednesday it expects both its third quarter and full year 1996 earnings to be below analysts estimates and below 1995 results.  </p>
<p>Great Lakes earned $1.15 a share in the 1995 third quarter and $4.52 for all of 1995.</p>
<p>Great Lakes, a specialty chemical producer, said lower results reflect continued weakness in the polymer industry, particularly in Europe and the Far East. The softness in demand limited sales volumes and hurt pricing, it said.</p>
<p>In addition, operating plants at lower levels to take down inventories increased manufacturing costs and temporarily narrowed margins, it said. A strengthening U.S. dollar against major foreign currencies reduced the profitability of international operations, the company said in a statement.  </p>
<p>According to First Call, the consensus estimate for Great Lakes 1996 third quarter earnings is $1.18 a share and for the full 1996 year is $4.57.</p>
<p>Orders and shipping rates for lead antiknock compounds also declined, the company said.</p>
<p>Great Lakes said it has expanded capacity and implemented cost reduction programs which will benefit profitability when its key markets turn around.</p>
<p>Shares of Great Lakes closed at 57 on Tuesday.</p>
