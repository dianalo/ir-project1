<p>Financial services group ING Groep NV (ING) said on Wednesday it had withdrawn from talks on the purchase of U.S. investment bank Dillon Read.</p>
<p>"The management of ING Group now expects Dillon Read's partners to exercise their option to repurchase the 25 percent stake which is presently held by ING at the end of June," the Dutch banking and insurance group said in a statement.  </p>
<p>ING spokesman Ruud Polet said the Dutch company had ended the talks because they had stalled over the issue of Dillon Read's position within ING's strategy.</p>
<p>"We have a global focus on corporate and investment banking, we have set out a strategy for that and they couldn't find the right place in that strategy," he said.  </p>
<p>"We ended the acquisition talks. If you can't come any further then you agree to end the talks and we took the initiative in that," said Polet.  </p>
<p>ING said on May 1 it was interested in buying out the 75 percent of Dillon, Read and Co it did not already own if the conditions were right, aiming to complete the talks within two weeks from that date.</p>
<p>Media reports had estimated the cost of buying out Dillon Read at $425-$450 million.</p>
<p>Polet had no comment on the value of the 25 percent stake it held in the U.S. company, saying: "Management is able to purchase the 25 percent stake but I don't know how much money is involved," he said.  </p>
<p>Polet said ING's strategy remained to grow its investment banking business in the U.S. and elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p>"We will build further our corporate and investment banking business around the world, including the U.S. region. So we will grow by means of organic growth and we will certainly look for another (acquisition) opportunity," he said.</p>
<p>Asked whether the move away from Dillon Read could be linked to interest in U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers he said: "That (talk ING wanted to buy Lehman Brothers) was a rumour in the market last week and we don't react on rumours or speculation," he said.</p>
