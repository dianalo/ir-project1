<p>Britain's opposition leader Tony Blair called on Monday for national elections as soon as possible, pledging to use all means to bring down the government before the May 1997 poll deadline.</p>
<p>In a New Year's message Blair, the Labour Party chief, said Prime Minister John Major's government -- now a minority administration -- had been drifting aimlessly for more than a year.</p>
<p>"As the government staggers on, we will seek to bring it down in any way we can, in accordance with the national interest and proper parliamentary procedure," Blair said.</p>
<p>"I believe that when the prime minister finally calls an election, the people will choose new Labour," he added.</p>
<p>Blair's revamped Labour Party is running some 20 points ahead of the government in opinion polls after modernising its image, dropping historic commitments to nationalisation of major industries and pledging restraint on public spending and tax.</p>
<p>Major, whose Conservatives have been in power since 1979, is reported to be planning a lengthy election campaign to wear down Labour's poll lead and capitalise on a booming economy.</p>
<p>In order to win a parliamentary confidence vote necessary to bring the government down, Labour would have to secure the votes of all opposition parties as well as the Ulster Unionists who have tended to vote with the Conservatives.</p>
<p>In his own New Year message on Sunday, Major urged Britons to look at recent economic successes after a deep, lengthy recession. He said Labour was an "untried, unrealistic alternative". Blair said Labour offered a new political agenda for Britain "for the radical centre which breaks the traditional dividing lines of left and right."</p>
<p>He pledged that a Labour government would establish a new partnership with business and industry, extend educational opportunity, be strong in Europe and put in place the foundations of a modernised welfare state.</p>
<p>"The British people are looking to new Labour for leadership, for a renewed sense of purpose and direction, and for hope. I am confident we can rise to the challenge," he said.</p>
<p>"We have changed and the people know these changes are real and lasting."</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel urged Britain on Sunday to use the forthcoming election to commit itself to the European Union.</p>
<p>In comments widely seen in Britain as unwelcome interference in domestic affairs, Kinkel said Britain must reach a clear decision on its European policy.</p>
