<p>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) plans to postpone its mid-year review of the U.S. economy and the federal budget until the current budget negotiations are completed, a U.S. official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The official, who asked not to be named, said there was ample precedent for postponing the mid-session review, which is usually released in mid-July, adding: "It makes no sense to put out a report that will be out of date in three weeks."</p>
<p>Members of the House of Representatives and the Senate are working to hammer out differences between their respective budget bills before Congress goes on its August recess.</p>
<p>The legislation would enact the balanced budget agreement that President Bill Clinton and the Republican leaders of Congress reached in May. The accord aims to balance the U.S. budget by 2002.</p>
