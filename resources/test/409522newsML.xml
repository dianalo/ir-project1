<headline>UAW reaches pact with GM auto parts hauler.</headline>
<dateline>FLINT, Mich. 1997-02-28</dateline>
<text>
<p>The United Auto Workers union said Friday it reached a tentative agreement with Automotive Component Carrier Inc, an auto parts hauling firm sold last year by General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>The contract, covering 565 workers in Michigan, is the first to be negotiated under the company's new owner, Detroit-based Penske Corp. ACC transports parts from GM's components plants to its assembly plants in Michigan.</p>
<p>Details of the contract were being with held pending ratification meetings scheduled for next week in Flint, Mich.</p>
<p>However, the UAW has been demanding that buyers of former GM operations agree to the same terms as the union's GM pattern agreement, which calls for a $2,000 lump-sum payment in the first year, followed by three percent raises in the second and third year, along with generous pension benefits. Workers at ACC were previously covered under terms of the GM national agreement.</p>
<p>"The solidarity and support of the UAW membership at ACC were the keys to reaching this excellent new agreement," UAW President Stephen Yokich said in a statment.</p>
<p>The new contract will cover truck drivers, mechanics and operational support personnel at ACC's four main terminals in Flint, Lansing, Pontiac and Saginaw, and three satellite terminals in Detroit, Milford and Ypsilanti.</p>
