<p>Regent Kingpin is to make an offer to repurchase the shares and warrants in the Regent Kingpin Chile Value Fund shortly after the start of dealings in the new fund.</p>
<p>"This is because the largest shareholder in Regent Kingpin, having intended to elect for cash under the sheme, wishes to realise its entire investment in Regent Kingpin," Barings said in a statement.</p>
<p>A battle erupted last year for the control of the GT Chile Growth Fund, managed by LGT Asset Management, when Regent bid for the fund, one of the largest investors in Chile.  </p>
<p>Under terms of an agreement signed in May, shareholders had the option to realise cash or retain an investment in Chile, either through a new LGT Asset fund or through a new Regent fund.</p>
<p>In July, shareholders representing $262.5 million of the fund's assets opted for cash, $88.9 million for the new LGT fund and $18.0 million for the Regent fund.</p>
<p>Market sources explained that one of the shareholders originally opting for Regent had ticked the wrong box on the voting form by mistake and had intended to go for cash.</p>
<p>As well as Regent making an offer to that shareholder to allow a cash exit, the new GT Chile Growth Fund Holdings Ltd will make an offer to buy the Regent Chile fund at formula asset value on October 14.</p>
<p>"This agreement is conditional on Regent Kingpin Chile Fund Ltd having at completion, a formula asset value of between $4.5 million and $5.0 million," the statement said. -- David Chance, London Newsroom +44 171 542 5887</p>
