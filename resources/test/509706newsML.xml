<p>Iran and Iraq on Tuesday exchanged the remains of 75 soldiers killed during their 1980-88 war, the official Iranian news agency IRNA said.</p>
<p>It said the bodies of 20 Iranians were exchanged for those of 55 Iraqi soldiers at the southwestern Shalamcheh border post.</p>
<p>Iran and Iraq have swapped thousands of prisoners of war and remains of soldiers. But the missing in action and the POWs are still among the thorniest issues hindering efforts to improve ties between the former foes.</p>
<p>Iran has said 5,000 to 10,000 prisoners are held by Iraq. Baghdad denies holding any Iranians and says more than 20,000 Iraqis are held by Tehran.</p>
