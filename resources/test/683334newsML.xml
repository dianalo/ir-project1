<p>The United States has decided it will be represented at the swearing-in of Hong Kong's controversial new legislature despite the fact that Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is boycotting the event, the State Department said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In Albright's sted, the U.S. consul general in Hong Kong, Richard Boucher, will attend the swearing-in ceremony, spokesman Nicholas Burns said.</p>
<p>Boucher "has to work, for better or worse, with the new legislature. For practical reasons, he will go," Burns said.</p>
<p>He briefed reporters en route to San Francisco where Albright was due to give a speech on U.S.-Asia policy before the prestigious Commonwealth Club.</p>
<p>After San Francisco, Albright flies to Vietnam and may make a stop in Cambodia before arriving in Hong Kong for the ceremonies surrounding the handover of Hong Kong to China on July 1 after more than 150 years of British control.</p>
<p>The State Department had announced recently that Albright would not attend the swearing-in of the new Hong Kong legislature because it was appointed rather than chosen in free elections.</p>
<p>The new, Beijing-backed legislature is to replace the elected Legislative Council, which ceases to function at midnight on June 30. But Burns said Albright expects to walk out of the handover ceremony before the new legislature is sworn in.</p>
<p>Burns said the decision had been made that Boucher would stay at the ceremony.</p>
