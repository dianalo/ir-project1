<p>Giant state-owned Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) surged on its debut on Monday after it was heavily oversubscribed during its offer period, brokers said.</p>
<p>At 0330 GMT, BNI stock was trading a 1,225 rupiah against the offer price of 850 rupiah and topped the active list with 145.6 million shares traded. It had risen to 1,300 rupiah earlier.</p>
<p>A total of 4.34 billion shares were listed on the Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges on Monday.</p>
<p>The bank offered one-fourth of its equity, about 1.08 billion shares, to the public during the offer period from November 4 to 7.</p>
<p>PT Danareksa Sekuritas, the lead underwriter, announced on November 15 that the stock was oversubscribed 4.46 times during the public offer.</p>
<p>Brokers predicted the stock will be traded in a range between 1,200 rupiah and 1,300 rupiah during the day.</p>
<p>"There is large selling pressure at the price of 1,275 rupiah but I believe if it can pass that resistance level, there is room to increase," a local broker said.</p>
