<p>Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo has called for an end to political violence following a series of deadly clashes between leftist rebels and the army, the presidential office said on Saturday.</p>
<p>"We must make respect and civility the norm and eradicate violence and provocation," Zedillo said late on Friday during a visit to the northern state of Chihuahua.</p>
<p>Zedillo indirectly criticised rebels of the Marxist Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR) for launching attacks in the western state of Guerrero this week that killed at least nine people. The attacks were the rebel group's first this year.</p>
<p>"Let us not be fooled. At times there are those who prefer violence to democracy, who provoke a physical response and later say they are victims of repression," Zedillo said.</p>
<p>Rebels and members of the centre-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD) have charged the army with waging a dirty war in the region, arresting opposition politicians and torturing residents suspected of sympathising with the rebels.</p>
<p>The PRD said late on Friday that soldiers had arrested and tortured four peasant farmers in Guerrero, forcing the men to confess they belonged to the EPR. The armed group, which first appeared in 1996, has vowed to overthrow Zedillo's government.</p>
