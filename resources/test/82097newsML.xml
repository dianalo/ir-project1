<p>Anagen Plc, the UK diagnostics company whose shares were recently suspended after talks collapsed with potential partners for its AuraFlex system, said on Friday its advisers were now looking for a buyer for all or part of the Anagen UK Limited company.</p>
<p>It is particularly interested in finding a buyer for AuraFlex, after failing to raise sufficient further capital to search for a replacement marketing partner for that unit, the company said in a statement.  </p>
<p>It said that Philip Sykes and Martin Fishman of Arthur Andersen will be looking for a buyer.</p>
<p>Anagen directors will continue to monitor the financial position of the group and make a further announcement when appropriate.</p>
