<p>A man was shot in the head and killed in northern Spain on Thursday in what a government official said was clearly a guerrilla attack.</p>
<p>Spanish police said the man received a single shot in the forehead at close range and later died in hospital.</p>
<p>"It is clear that is was an terrorist attack," said local authority official Roman Sudupe.</p>
<p>A Basque government spokesman confirmed the victim had not been a member of the security forces, a common target for Basque separatist group ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom).</p>
<p>The 39-year-old victim was a bicycle salesman, married with two children, who police described as a "normal citizen".</p>
<p>Police could not confirm whether the attack was in fact the work of ETA, which has killed some 800 people since 1968 in its campaign for an independent Basque state.</p>
<p>An ETA woman guerrilla shot in the head and killed an army officer earlier in January, marking the first separatist assassination this year, government officials said.</p>
