<p>Hungary's Minister of Interior on Wednesday repeated government warnings that police would prevent farmers' union METESZ from carrying out its threat to block border crossings.</p>
<p>Gabor Kuncze told Hungarian radio he still hoped there would be no need for police action, but police would maintain order should it be necessary.</p>
<p>METESZ sent the government an ultimatum on Monday evening saying that it would start blockades of Hungary's border crossings and roads leading into Budapest unless their demand for unconditional tax relief for farmers earning less than 1.5 million forints ($8,500) a year is met.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Elemer Kiss said on Tuesday such action would be both unconstitutional and illegal and police would clear the roads should the farmers go ahead with their plan.</p>
<p>METESZ leaders said they maintain their ultimatum despite the government's warning and would block border crossing leading to all neighbouring countries unless their demands are met by Thursday evening.</p>
<p>A February demonstration in the central Hungarian town of Kiskoros sparked a series of farmers' protests following the government's 1997 income and social security tax increases for individual farmers.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Gyula Horn has ceded to farmers' union demands for roundtable talks to solve the crisis of the agriculture. He announced on Tuesday that the talks would take place on April 25 to 27.</p>
<p>Hungary has almost 30 farmers' unions whith sometimes conflicting interests depending regarding land ownership, taxation and subsidy issues.</p>
