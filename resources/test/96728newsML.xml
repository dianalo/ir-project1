<p>A new settlement system for Ecu-denominated Italian Treasury notes (CTE) will start on Monday on the over-the-counter secondary market, the Bank of Italy said in a statement.</p>
<p>The central bank said the system would operate according to the delivery versus payment (DVP) procedure.</p>
<p>The new system, called SIRTE, due to the introduction of technical innovations, was designed to remove some of the obstacles which still limit trade in CTEs, the Bank said.</p>
<p>Also, the new system would allow banks to gain experience in the management of a gross settlement system with DVP, in line with the international trend towards adopting more secure settlement procedures.</p>
<p>The Bank of Italy, as operator of the SIRTE system, and in agreement with the Italian Banking Association, said it had in the initial phase limited access to the system to a fixed number of banks, among which are the six Italian Ecu clearer banks and some Italian branches of the major foreign banks.</p>
<p>But participation in the system could gradually be expanded to other interested banks which satisfy the criteria for access, the Bank added.</p>
