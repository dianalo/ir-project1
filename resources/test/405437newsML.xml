<p>Asian MTBE prices are set to remain steady to soft amid weaker oil prices in the near term, industry sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It is quite weak...the whole energy complex is down," a trader said on the weaker crude and oil product prices.</p>
<p>Crude oil prices have dropped from its peak at the begining of the year to a six-month low, a trader said.</p>
<p>"MTBE is bearish, and finding offers at $270-$272 (free-on-board) is not a problem, but there is not a lot of buying," another trader said who expected prices to come down.</p>
<p>Traders assessed Singapore MTBE free-on-board (fob) prices between $270-$273 per tonne with a March parcel heard sold even as low as $268.</p>
<p>They said Thai refiner Bangchak Petroleum Plc bought 1,500 tonnes for delivery in March in a tender which closed February 17 at $280-285 per tonne c-and-f.</p>
<p>"Supplies are relaxed because demand is not there, especially for the second half of March where there is a large inventory," he said.</p>
<p>He said for some of the surplus to find an outlet in the U.S. West Coast, fob prices in Asia had to fall below $260 per tonne.</p>
<p>Producers were less bearish and quoted cost-and-freight (c-and-f) parcels at $285, steady from last week.</p>
<p>With feedstock still firm and even higher than MTBE prices, producers were unwilling to lower offers and would prefer to sell the feedstock instead.</p>
<p>Methanol, a major feedstock of MTBE, was priced at $280-$290 per tonne, a producer said.</p>
<p>Traders hoped for firmer price direction after Taiwan announced a new tender for up to two 3,500-tonne MTBE cargoes for April 6-20 delivery to Kaohsiung or Keelung which closes March 3 and valid for two days.</p>
<p>In its last tender, Taiwan bought 7,000-tonnes for March 1-15 delivery from SABIC at $283 per tonne c-and-f Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taiwan also announced a fresh tender for leaded and unleaded reformate for April 1-15 delivery. The tender closes March 4 and is valid until March 6.</p>
<p>Taiwan's reformate requirements might boost blending demand for MTBE which is lacklustre, traders said.</p>
<p>"Blending demand is very thin around Singapore... gasoline prices are not so good therefore demand will be low," a trader said.</p>
<p>Gasoline prices in Singapore firmed on Tuesday, but had been come off more than $1.00 per barrel under aggressive selling to trade at $26.60 on Monday.</p>
