<headline>Indonesia late palm olein stable, export taxes up.</headline>

<p>Indonesian palm olein prices were stable in late trading on Wednesday, with the government announcing higher export taxes in January for crude palm oil and three products.</p>
<p>They said olein was generally quoted at 1,450-55 rupiah/kg in Jakarta, unchanged from the opening, but offers were also heard at 1,445 rupiah. No crude palm oil deals were heard.</p>
<p>The traders said the state logistics agency BULOG was on its second day of market operations to keep a lid on prices, selling olein directly to consumers at 1,300 rupiah/litre.</p>
<p>"The export tax was within market expectations," one said.</p>
<p>The tax on crude palm oil had been raised to $46.80 per tonne in January from $44.72 in December, the Finance Ministry said on Wednesday. The tax on RBD palm olein had been raised to $47.60/tonne in January from $41.30, while that on RBD palm oil had been increased to $39.76/tonne from $33.04/tonne.</p>
<p>The tax on crude olein had been increased to $51.10/tonne in January from $44.80 in December.</p>
<p>Traders said that although the market operations by BULOG had made the market cautious it had had no significant impact on prices because of strong gains in the Malaysian market.  </p>
<p>"The market is not quite certain how much oil BULOG will pump into the market," one trader said. "Prices will only weaken if BULOG channels a lot of oil into the market."</p>
<p>Traders said BULOG was not expected to push large quantities of olein into the market because the market operations, which began on Tuesday, end on January 15.</p>
<p>BULOG chief Beddu Amang said on Wednesday that the agency had imported a total of 52,000 tonnes of olein from Malaysia, with the last batch of 13,000 tonnes set to enter the country.</p>
<p>The market operations are to ensure local prices do not rise during the Moslem Ramadan fasting month and Eid al-Fitr.</p>
