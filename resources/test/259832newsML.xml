<headline>European bunkers firm with pre-holiday buying rush.</headline>
<dateline>AMSTERDAM 1996-12-16</dateline>
<text>
<p>European bunkers were firmer on Monday as crude raced higher, leading to a rush of pre-Christmas shipping shoppers, dealers said.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 CST was up about $1 to $122/$124 fob, even though the barge market lost its initial gains. Two large orders came in for Rotterdam and Antwerp lifting. Total ARA demand amounted to about 15,000 tonnes, dealers said.</p>
<p>"There was quite a lot of smaller lots done as well," said one supplier.</p>
<p>Hamburg bunkers were also up by about $1 a tonne to $125/$126 fob.</p>
<p>Reasonable volumes left most suppliers satisfied.</p>
<p>Mediterranean prices were $1-$2 higher than at close on Friday.</p>
<p>Spanish ports in particular received healthy enquiry volumes, despite a $2 jump in fuel oil prices.</p>
<p>In France, dealers said supplies were rather tight.</p>
<p>Fujairah prices jumped to around $115 fob, in line with strength in Singapore and the subsequent crude surge.</p>
