<p>Stocks closed Wednesday sharply higher on a techncial rebound, combined with renewed hopes for an early rise in the foreign ownership ceiling, brokers said.</p>
<p>The market's early rise was in reaction to the six straight days of falls until Monday. In the afternoon, a news report the government would soon announce the foreign stock ownership ceiling expansion fuelled broad-based buying.</p>
<p>But the U.S. Federal Reserve's increase of its short-term interest rate had no major impact.</p>
<p>The composite stock index jumped 2.77 percent, or 17.72 points, to close at 656.62.  </p>
<p>"This is basically a technical rebound after the market's sharp drops last week," said broker Lim Chong-woo of Ssangyong Investment and Securities. "Buying orders in a lack of selling led to the big rises today and yesterday."</p>
<p>Out of 695 gainers, 169 stocks went to daily upper limits.</p>
<p>But brokers cautioned as they saw a strong selling force awaiting at around the 670-point level.</p>
<p>"Considering the economic fundamentals, the market is expected to see a downward correction very soon," said analyst Yoo Nam-gil of Hyundai Securities.  </p>
<p>Petrochemicals rose on expectations that falling naphtha prices and rising export demand would help improve earnings of petrochemical makers.</p>
<p>Honam Petrochemical Corp ended 900 won higher at its daily limit of 13,300. Hanwha Chemical Corp also ended at its upper limit of 8,680 won by gaining 640 won.</p>
<p>"Although there remain some variables, falling naphtha prices will be a big help for their earnings this year," analyst William Ryoo of LG Securities said.</p>
<p>Chipmakers also gained on news reports that memory chip prices were recovering from last year's slump.  </p>
<p>Hyundai Electronics Industries Co closed 2,100 won higher at 38,800 and LG Semicon Co rose 100 won to 28,000.</p>
<p>But Samsung Electronics ended 500 won lower at 60,000 won on quick profit-taking after having risen to a day high of 61,500 won.</p>
<p>The index futures June contracts rose 0.90 points to 63.90 and the underlying KOSPI-200 index added 1.91 points to 66.90.</p>
