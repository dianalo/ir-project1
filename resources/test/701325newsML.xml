<title>UK: Large metal objects in Maracaibo channel - report.</title>

<p>The Maracaibo shipping channel probably contains large metallic underwater objects in the area where three tankers ran aground earlier this year, an official Venezuelan Navy report has revealed.</p>
<p>The report, which Reuters has seen, said several magnetic objects of moderate intensity were found inside the channel between buoys 19 and 20 and buoys 21 and 22.</p>
<p>"It is probable that in this area there are large metallic objects," it added.</p>
<p>Three oil tanker groundings early this year, between buoys 20 and 22, have raised serious concerns about the state of the Maracaibo channel which handles around 70 percent of Venezuela's oil exports.</p>
<p>Draught restrictions, now at 38 feet compared with a normal 39.5 ft, have been in place since the groundings.</p>
<p>The Greek-owned tanker Nissos Amorgos spilled about 25,000 barrels of oil after grounding on February 28. The ship and its master are still detained in Venezuela.</p>
<p>Tanker owners' organisation Intertanko has pointed to evidence that silting caused the 89,428 dwt ship to slow down, lose steerage and hit an underwater object which breached its cargo tanks.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Nissos Amorgos' owner said the report also showed that much of the channel was below the draught limits designated for safe transit by tankers.</p>
<p>Venezuela's transport minister has previously said the ship may have hit the wreck of the Exportador which sank 10 years ago.</p>
<p>The Nissos Amorgos incident was followed in March by the nearby grounding of another Greek-flagged tanker, the Olympic Sponsor. It has been claimed that a large piece of metal became embedded in the 96,457 dwt vessel's hull when it ran aground between buoys 22 and 20.</p>
<p>A Maltese flagged tanker, the Corelli, ran aground in April very close to the site of the two previous accidents.</p>
<p>The survey of the channel was carried out by the Venezuela Navy's hydrography and navigation department during April and May. The report adds that visual inspection of the sunken objects still has to be made by divers. -Paul Berrill Reuters Shipping News + 44 171 542 4087. Fax 5017.</p>
