<p>Voters in the French Riviera city of Nice backed their right-wing mayor's ban on beggars in the town centre by a two-to-one margin in a referendum on Sunday, but four-fifths did not bother to vote.</p>
<p>Mayor Jacques Peyrat, a former member of the extreme-right National Front now with the ruling Gaullist RPR party, said he was very satisfied with the outcome of the consultative ballot.</p>
<p>The Socialist and Communist opposition had urged voters to boycott the referendum, while the national leadership of the Gaullist party had observed an embarrassed silence.</p>
<p>Peyrat sparked protests last summer by banning "begging on the public highway" and drinking alcohol in the street. Police picked up offenders and dumped them 15 km (10 miles) from the city centre.</p>
<p>A total of 1,356 homeless people were forcibly evicted from the town under the system. Twenty-five of them have filed a lawsuit for deprivation of liberty against the mayor.</p>
