<p>A Korean Air Lines (KAL) Boeing 747 which crashed yesterday on Guam in the Pacific had an insured value of some $60 million, London insurance sources told Reuters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Broker for the 1984 built aircraft is London based CT Bowring, a part of Marsh &amp; McLennan.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Bowring said the original insurer is Oriental Fire and Marine Insurance Company Limited in Seoul.</p>
<p>Market sources said the aircraft would be widely reinsured on the aviation market, adding that Oriental Fire and Marine would have retained only a very small part of the risk.</p>
<p>Reinsurance in the London market was led by Chaucer syndicate 173 and Murray Lawrence syndicate 824 at Lloyd's of London.</p>
<p>Underwriter for the syndicates John Butler said they were sending a surveyor and a solicitor to help to establish the circumstances of the crash.</p>
<p>Insurers said their main concerns were with the survivors and the families of those killed. They were unwilling to talk about possible compensation at this stage.</p>
<p>There were 231 passengers and 23 crewmembers on the Boeing 747, which crashed into a hillside near Guam's main airport overnight.</p>
<p>The latest casualty figures from U.S. authorities put the number of survivors at 30, with 69 bodies recovered and 155 people still missing.</p>
<p>The aircraft, registration HL7468, was powered by four Pratt &amp; Whitney JT9D engines. Pratt &amp; Whitney is owned by United Technologies .</p>
<p>KAL is an affiliate of South Korea's Hanjin Group.</p>
<p>There have been a spate of aviation accidents in the last week, starting with the crash of a FedEx MD11 freighter.</p>
<p>No lives were lost in that incident, but the cost to insurers is expected to be $115 million.</p>
<p>Other incidents occurred at Manchester airport in Britain, Florence airport in Italy and Douala airport in Cameroon.</p>
<p>The ATR-42 involved in the Florence crash, in which the pilot died, has been declared a total constructive loss and was insured for $14.5 million, one London aviation underwriter said.</p>
<p>There were no serious casualties in the Manchester and Douala accidents, but Air Afrique has told Reuters that its Boeing 737 was largely destroyed by fire at Douala.</p>
<p>The 1969 built aircraft, registration TUTAV, would be worth around $3.0 million, aviation sources said.</p>
