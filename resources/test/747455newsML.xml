<p>Another dramatic fall by the Kiwi dollar hoisted the entire New Zealand yield curve more than 20 basis points on Tuesday, and dealers said the currency would continue to dictate its shape for some time to come.</p>
<p>"It's going to come back to the Kiwi. I suspect the Kiwi will go lower at some point, just the way it traded today. It does still look and feel pretty vulnerable," a senior dealer said.</p>
<p>The kiwi, which plunged one U.S. cent last Friday, resumed its slide in early Tuesday trade with a sharp drop of over 50 basis points to US$0.6480. It closed just under 65 cents.  </p>
<p>The key 90-day bank bill rate responded with an early spikeup of over 20 points. Bond yields also jumped higher, with the liquidation of some offshore holdings in the middle to longer part of the curve seen aggrevating the move.</p>
<p>Although The kiwi's late stabilisation in afternoon trade relieved some pressure on the yield curve, dealers said an air of trepidation pervaded the debt markets with the widespread expectation that the currency will fall further.</p>
<p>"It's never really bounced all day, it's just been sitting there, and it's got the whole market very nervous," one said of the kiwi. The TWI ended at 64.45, versus Monday's 64.54 close.  </p>
<p>He said rates should rise further if the kiwi continued to sink simply because of the Reserve Bank's use of the Monetary Conditions Index (MCI), which measures the mix of the 90-day rate and the kiwi's Trade-Weighted Index (TWI).</p>
<p>"In theory, yes. I guess because of the MCI concept and the way it works, they have to go higher. But I really wonder whether bond rates have got a lot left in them. They have sold off a lot now in the last three or four trading days," he said.</p>
<p>"But if the short end goes, the long end will follow to a certain extent. It's all in the hands of the kiwi."</p>
