<p>Gambians flocked to the polls to choose a new president on Thursday in an election in which 1994 coup leader Yahya Jammeh is standing against three civilian rivals.</p>
<p>Voters formed orderly queues as polling began peacefully at 7 a.m. (0700 GMT) in tiny mainly Moslem West African country's capital Banjul after a campaign marked by violence.</p>
<p>"I am impressed by the massive turnout with long queues," Jammeh told reporters after casting his vote at a polling station on July 22 Square, named after his 1994 putsch which toppled independence president Sir Dawda Jawara.</p>
<p>Many soldiers queued to vote at the same polling station.</p>
<p>There was no visible sign of organisational chaos that has bedevilled recent elections in West Africa. Voting ends at 6 p.m. (1800 GMT).</p>
<p>"People are disciplined," said Jammeh, 31, who wore flowing white traditional robes and a turban and carried prayer beads and a walking stick.</p>
<p>"It's done," said a veiled Moslem woman at Banjul City Council polling station, showing off her finger stained with indelible ink to prevent multiple voting.</p>
<p>A short walk up the street at the National Arts Council polling station, a long queue snaked out onto the pavement from courtyard polling booths.</p>
<p>There was no obvious security force presence except for a handful of unarmed police. Voters appeared in a jovial mood.</p>
<p>Pre-poll favourite Jammeh, who toppled Jawara accusing him of corruption, had said initially he was not interested in politics. He resigned from the army to participate in the poll for the Alliance for Patriotic Reorientation and Reconstruction which he formed with associates from the army.</p>
<p>His main rival is lawyer Ousainou Darboe, 48, of the United Democratic Party. Darboe, vice-president of the Gambia Bar Association, has the backing of the former British colony's established politicians whom Jammeh banned from the poll, citing their past association with Jawara.</p>
<p>Supporters of the two rivals clashed in the final days of the campaign, prompting fears of fresh unrest. On the eve of the poll, Jammeh ordered Gambians to stay at home after voting and await the announcement of results on the radio.</p>
<p>Results, to be decided by a simple majority, could be known as early as Friday, electoral officials said.</p>
<p>The other contenders are Sidia Jatta of the small People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism, who stood against Jawara in 1992, and hotel manager Amath Bah of the National Reconciliation Party (NRP).</p>
<p>Jammeh's coup and his initial plan to delay elections until 1998 alienated the poverty-stricken country's traditional Western partners, putting its aid-dependent economy under strain. Jammeh has since strengthened ties with Libya, Taiwan and Cuba.</p>
