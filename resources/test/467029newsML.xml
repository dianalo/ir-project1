<p>International Securities Market Association (ISMA) membership fell in 1996 to 818 from 836 the previous year, it said in its annual report on Tuesday.</p>
<p>This fall reflected consolidation in the financial industry following mergers, takeovers and closures and was expected to continue, although at a slower pace, ISMA said.</p>
<p>ISMA would need to attract more members in emerging market economies to compensate for the decline of membership in the more mature financial centres, the report said.</p>
<p>ISMA currently has 819 members, including 39 associate members, from 48 countries.</p>
