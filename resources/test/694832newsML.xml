<p>Poland's left-wing government, faced with an uphill battle to stay in power in September elections, is fending off mounting calls for austerity to avoid turning an economic success story into a disaster.</p>
<p>The government, usually proud of its impressive economic record, found itself on the defensive this week when the central bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said separately that only a balanced budget would save Poland from a Czech-style currency crisis.</p>
<p>At the heart of the debate is the ballooning trade deficit, caused by a steep increase in imports, that for many economists and investors means a threat of eventual devaluation and economic slow-down.</p>
<p>The dispute put a strain on the Polish currency, the zloty, which fell half a percentage point on Thursday. Share prices also eased as some foreign investors reacted nervously to the dispute.</p>
<p>Poland's fundamentals remain encouraging but are in the shadow of recent events in the Czech Republic, where a runaway trade gap provoked a speculative attack on the crown and contributed to a considerable economic slowdown.</p>
<p>Analysts have forecast Poland's current account deficit to widen to some $6 billion this year from $1.4 billion in 1996 and the trade gap to soar to $12 billion, or five percent of GDP, from $8.2 billion last year.</p>
<p>In the first four months of 1997, Poland's C/A deficit amounted to $2.3 billion and the trade gap to $4 billion. The forecast for next year is more dismal, with some seeing the trade gap hitting $16 billion, or eight percent of GDP.</p>
<p>CURBING DEMAND IS NECESSARY</p>
<p>The government agrees with analysts that domestic demand and consumption must be curbed to cool down the deficit. But Finance Minister Marek Belka rebuffed calls for a balanced budget immediately.</p>
<p>He said planned reduction in the deficit next year and high real interest rates should sufficiently cool demand.</p>
<p>"We know we have to cool internal demand and that restrictive monetary and budget policies are needed...but I think that (what we propose) will be sufficient," Belka told a news conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The government has indicated next year's budget deficit would fall to two or less percent of GDP from this year's planned 2.8 percent shortfall. But the IMF, which does not lend to Poland at the moment but keeps monitoring the economy, is not satisfied.</p>
<p>"We advise the government to do everything possible to limit the deficit already in 1997 and reduce it even further next year, so that producing a balanced budget is possible in 1999 at the latest," IMF representative Markus Rodlauer said in a newspaper comment.</p>
<p>Analysts said the budget deficit could be slashed in 1998 if Poland cut subsidies to ailing sectors such as mining or agriculture or ended costly indexation of wages.</p>
<p>They doubted, however, that government would risk announcing unpopular spending cuts as it gears up its election campaign to fight off a challenge from right-wing parties grouped around Solidarity.</p>
<p>Apparently ducking the issue, the government announced that the final budget draft would be presented in October -- after the elections -- leaving a potential time-bomb to whoever wins.</p>
<p>"At levels now proposed by the government it's going to be touch and go but the outcome of next year's budget is as uncertain as the outcome of the elections," said Robert Beange, economist at Lehman Brothers in London.</p>
<p>He said there was some hope that after the elections that any government with a fresh mandate would be able to tighten up considerably, seeing the dangers of failing to react.</p>
<p>"With the Czech crisis in such recent memory I can see that after elections are out of the way the budget could tighten a little more then they are talking about at the moment...if a reasonable, solid government forms."</p>
<p>MONETARY, EXCHANGE RATE POLICY TIGHT ENOUGH</p>
<p>Finance Minister Belka, a non-party economist allied to President Aleksander Kwasniewski, says critics should have some patience to allow current monetary environment to work.</p>
<p>"You should have some faith in our monetary policy and some patience," Belka told investors in New York this week.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Poland, the central bank, twice increased obligatory reserves this year while keeping nominal interest rates flat amid falling inflation.</p>
<p>Poland's official rates, at 25 and 22 percent for the lombard and discount rate respectively, have remained fixed since last July, while inflation has slipped some six points to year-on-year 14.6 percent in May this year.</p>
<p>Analysts believe monetary policy was restrictive enough and that further tightening would be counter-productive.</p>
<p>It would be costly to the budget by raising costs of borrowing, stifle investment and attract hot foreign capital whose swings are indirectly to blame for the Czech crown's downfall.</p>
<p>"An interest rise is the last thing Poland needs," said Krzysztof Rybinski, head analyst at ING Bank in Warsaw.</p>
<p>This widely-held view was not shared by the IMF, which said Poland should quickly tighten its monetary policy in order to suffocate ever-larger domestic demand.</p>
<p>Analysts also agree with financial authorities that a weakening of the zloty, a cure advocated by some politicians and exporters' lobbies, should be avoided.</p>
<p>Belka said the current one-percent per month crawling devaluation of the zloty offered exporters sufficient help and any deeper cut would offer only temporary relief. It would fail to address the core problem of containing booming domestic demand and have inflationary effects.</p>
<p>DEMAND PROPELLING ECONOMY FAST</p>
<p>The consumer and investment boom in Poland comes in the wake of more than four years of fast economic growth, and domestic demand is a strong factor propelling the economy. The first quarter GDP rose 7.3 percent.</p>
<p>Investment is growing at about 20 percent, which is a positive factor as the economy rapidly modernises, boosts capacity and efficiency.</p>
<p>Falling unemployment also contributes to higher consumer confidence, boosting consumer demand and the feel-good factor that the left counts on helping it win the vote.</p>
<p>Belka and some analysts say robust direct foreign investment would protect Poland from currency crisis by boosting hard currency reserves and gradually produce a boom in exports.</p>
<p>"As long as the (trade) gap is filled with foreign investments in productive assets there is no danger," Belka said.</p>
<p>"The difference between Poland and the Czech Republic is that our deficit is almost entirely financed by foreign direct investments and only in few percent by short-term capital while in the Czech Republic the proportion was different," he added.</p>
<p>Foreign direct investment rose $5.19 billion in 1996, pushing the amount attracted by Poland since 1990 to more than $12 billion. The government's Foreign Investment Agency (PAIZ) says the investment should reach $30 billion by the year 2000.</p>
