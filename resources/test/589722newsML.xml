<p>Romania's over-the-counter market (OTC) edged down on Friday in dull trading as big investors slipped into a wait-and-see mood, traders said.</p>
<p>Independent indices VAB-RASDAQ and BIG-OTC, computed by the VANGUARD and BIG brokerage houses, dropped by 1.9 and 2.54 percent respectively to 3,551.1 and 2,617.59 points.</p>
<p>Some operators said bearish sentiment might continue if the market was not hit by fresh news from the State Ownership Fund of sale of its stakes in OTC high-caps.</p>
<p>Cement makers Moldocim and Romcif closed 2,000 and 50 lei weaker at 28,500 and 1,650 respectively. A third cement maker, Romcim, ended flat at 66,000.</p>
<p>Oil refinery Arpechim, which accounts for around 16 percent of total market capitalisation, slumped 1,500 lei to 25,000.</p>
<p>Turnover slipped to 7.32 billion lei from 8.89 billion on Thursday, with 2.5 million shares traded over the day.</p>
<p>A similar bearish mood gripped the stock exchange on Friday, with average prices of most stocks falling and volumes on the decline.</p>
