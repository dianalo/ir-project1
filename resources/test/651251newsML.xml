<p>Finnish food packaging and confectionery group Huhtamaki Oy, reporting higher four-month profits, said on Tuesday it was actively seeking acquisitions after a wave of divestments last year and that full-year 1997 earnings per share would improve on 1996.</p>
<p>"Sales in emerging markets will gain momentum, and further acquisition opportunities are under active study," Huhtamaki said in a statement with its January-April results.</p>
<p>It reported four-month profits after financial items up 8.3 percent to 117 million markka from 108 million and, repeating an earlier outlook, said it expected an improvement in full-year earnings per share from 10.29 markka in 1996.</p>
<p>After selling its Leiras pharmaceuticals unit to German Schering AG for 1.43 billion markka, unloading its unprofitable collectable cards unit and selling its Star eye medicine unit last year, Huhtamaki says it can afford to be acquisitive.</p>
<p>"As a consequence of major company disposals at the end of 1996, Huhtamaki's opening balance was very strong," the company said, adding that it had kept most of its financial assets in marketable instruments to enable acquisitions.</p>
<p>It did not identify the businesses or regions where it could be interested in investing.</p>
<p>In January-April, the company paid off 580 million markka worth of interest-bearing debt and acquired the Asia-Pacific foods packaging firm Pacific World Packaging Group (PWP) with annual net sales of about 350 million markka.</p>
<p>Those moves reduced current assets by over 900 million markka, Huhtamaki said, adding that at end-April its net deposits amounted to 564 million markka.</p>
<p>While company divestments had led to lower earnings from current operations, higher corporate and financial revenue in the first four months more than offset this, Huhtamaki said.</p>
<p>Net sales in January-April were 1.90 billion markka, down 25 percent from the same period a year ago reflecting the balance of divestments and acquisitions, but up 19 percent when the divested units were eliminated, it said.</p>
<p>"The stronger seasons -- summer for food packaging and autumn for confectionery -- should result in higher margins, especially during the final four-month period," it said.</p>
<p>Referring to its Leaf confectionery business, Huhtamaki said the cost position would improve following the imminent closure of two manufacturing units.</p>
<p>The Polarcup packaging business would remain under some pressure due to raw materials prices, it said.</p>
