<p>The board of the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) will meet Thursday to resolve concerns some members have with a proposal to raise capacity on Pacific Intertie power lines for the spring, a WSCC spokeswoman said Monday.</p>
<p>A WSCC study group has proposed raising the Intertie limit to 7,700 megawatts (MW) from the current 6,250 MW through the end of June.</p>
<p>But some WSCC members, particularly Southwest utilities, are worried about potential overloading of the lines and power outages.</p>
<p>Use of the 7,900 MW Intertie system was cut by 65 percent after two widespread power outages hit the West last summer.</p>
<p>But, after careful study of the system and implementation of safety measures, the capacity was raised to 6,250 MW at the end of March.</p>
<p>Following the WSCC board review on Thursday, general members will have 10 days, or until May 8, to comment on the plan.</p>
<p>If comments still express valid concerns, the board could take another 10 days to review them, the WSCC spokeswoman noted.</p>
