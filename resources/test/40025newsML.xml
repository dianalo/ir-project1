<p>Thai stocks tumbled to their lowest level in nearly three years on Monday and closed firmly below the key 1,000 point level as forced selling of stocks by brokerages took its toll on the rumour-hit market.</p>
<p>The index finished down 2.10 percent, or 21.19 points, at 986.32, the lowest level since closing at 971.44 points on September 30, 1993.</p>
<p>Rumours about the financial health of some finance and securities firms and talk they might be hit by client margin loan defaults depressed the market, brokers said.</p>
<p>The sell-off, which began last Thursday, has continued despite recent denials by several firms, the stock exchange and the central bank.</p>
<p>There were purchases in the market again by some banks and brokers on Monday, using part of a 15.7 billion baht ($628 million) rescue fund that first entered the market on Friday, brokers said.</p>
<p>But they expected the index to fall again. Some said they saw support for the index at 980 points and resistance at 1,000.</p>
<p>"Investors' confidence has been shaken. Lingering rumours about finance and securities companies and the sharp fall in the index are enough to keep it down again tomorrow," said Nava Finance and Securities analyst Padermpob Songkroh.</p>
<p>Also affecting the market were concerns over the political future of the Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa, who faces a no-confidence debate on September 18, analysts said.</p>
<p>Bad economic news, including a drastic slowdown in exports and gross domestic product growth, also weighed on sentiment, they said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand said on Monday it had injected some 14 billion baht into the money market to relieve tight liquidity.</p>
<p>Assistant central bank governor Siri Ganjarerndee told reporters that some commercial banks were reluctant to lend money to rumour-hit financial institutions.</p>
<p>After the fund injection, the overnight interbank rate eased to 13.50-14.00 percent late on Monday compared with 14.00-14.50 percent in the morning and 12.50 percent late on Friday.</p>
<p>However, some dealers said they still expected the money market to remain tight in the coming days as short-term capital continued to flow out.</p>
<p>The baht remained weak, although it was not the subject of an offshore rumour or attack on Monday, with sentiment affected by the negative political and economic news, dealers said.</p>
<p>On Friday, the baht was sold after rumours by some Singapore investors that it might be devalued. The central bank swiftly denied the rumours.</p>
<p>However, some market analysts have warned that with Thailand's slowdown in export growth in the first seven months of 1996, the baht could come under attack again by foreigners expecting a devaluation.</p>
<p>On Monday, dealers said the currency was attractive for the moment because it offered high interest rates on deposits and moved in a narrow band.</p>
<p>The currency traded at 25.340-25.360 at 1150 GMT, compared with 25.345-25.348 in the late afternoon and 25.340-25.350 in the morning, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The dollar-baht spot rate was still high due to the hangover of baht devaluation rumour from Friday. But the market was quiet because people think it is expensive to buy dollars right now," one currency dealer said.</p>
