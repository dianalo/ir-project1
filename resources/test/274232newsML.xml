<p>Underscoring the decline in exile of China's once-powerful "Chiang dynasty", Taiwan made little fuss on Monday over the death of the grandson of the late president and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>Chiang Hsiao-yung, whose political inactivity constrasted with the epic historic roles played by his late father and grandfather, died on Sunday of oesophageal cancer. He was 48.</p>
<p>There were condolences from the ruling Nationalist Party, which his powerful and charismatic grandfather led into exile to Taiwan after the Republic of China's civil war defeat to the Chinese communists in 1949.</p>
<p>Chiang's death was page-one news in the local press but there was nothing resembling the nation-stopping mourning that made Generalissimo Chiang's 1975 death a Taiwan holiday.</p>
<p>"I feel a lot of sadness and give my condolence to family members," said Foreign Minister John Chang, Chiang Hsiao-yung's half brother and the only family descendant holding senior government office.</p>
<p>Despite using martial law to suppress dissent during his 26 years of autocratric rule in Taiwan, Generalissimo Chiang is still considered a hero for keeping the island out of reach of Beijing's communists and for fostering a powerful economy.</p>
<p>Chiang's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, inherited the presidency after his father's death but is revered for ending martial law in 1987 soon before his own death -- unleashing the democratic forces that broke his family's dynastic grip on power.</p>
<p>Chiang Ching-kuo's son, Chiang Hsiao-yung, lived his life almost totally on the margins of the Nationalist Party, government and army that his forebears ran.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's only surviving son, Wego Chiang, remains a Nationalist Party elder at 80 but is confined to a hospital bed with cancer.</p>
<p>Family members on Monday gave no indication whether they would push to have Chiang Hsiao-yung's remains buried in China.</p>
<p>The Chiang family has sought without success to return the bodies of Chiang Kai-shek and Chiang Ching-kuo to the Chinese mainland for burial. Their bodies lie embalmed in "temporary" mausoleums.</p>
<p>The family wants a mainland burial for Generalissimo Chiang as a symbolic realisation of his goal to return to China proper.</p>
<p>Chiang Hsiao-yung's death leaves Foreign Minister Chang as the only surviving son of Chiang Ching-kuo. Chang bears his mother's surname because she never married his father.</p>
<p>Chiang Hsiao-yung also is survived by his 98-year-old step-grandmother Soong Meiling -- or Madame Chiang Kai-shek -- the generalissimo's illustrious second wife who now lives quietly on New York's Long Island.</p>
