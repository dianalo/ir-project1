<p>Former Barings executive Ron Baker was cleared of most misconduct charges brought by British regulators after a hearing by an independent tribunal, his lawyer said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Baker, who received a reprimand, had been charged with failing to show "due skill, care and diligence" ahead of the February 1995 collapse of Barings, one of Britain's oldest investment banks. He faced a ban from working in London's financial district and unspecified damages.</p>
<p>The Securities and Futures Authority, the market regulator that had brought the charges and can appeal the tribunal's findings, declined to comment on the case. It has already banned several former Barings employees, including Peter Norris, chief executive of the failed bank, from working in the City, as London's financial district is known.</p>
<p>Baker, an Australian, was head of financial products at Barings and claimed he was not involved in the investment bank's businesses where rogue trader Nick Leeson racked up losses of $1.4 billion in unauthorised trades.</p>
<p>The tribunal upheld Baker's registration with the regulatory agency and ordered him to pay less than 5 percent of the tribunal's costs.</p>
<p>After it collapsed, Barings was bought by Dutch insurance and banking group Internationale Nederlanden Groep NV.</p>
<p>Baring Chairman Peter Baring and his deputy, Andrew Tuckey, were not disciplined but had to give the SFA assurances they would not seek top management jobs in the financial world again.</p>
