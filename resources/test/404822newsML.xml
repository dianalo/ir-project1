<p>Greek three-year, 10.20 percent coupon bonds due January 2000 and seven-year floaters due January 2004 skidded after U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said he would not rule out pre-emptive rate hike on upside inflation risk.</p>
<p>"The taxable three-year coupon bonds due 2000 and seven-year FRNs due 2004 have come under selling pressure from abroad after Greenspan's comments on inflation and a pre-emptive rate rise," said a bond dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>However, the dealer said strong support had emerged around 100.70 for the three-year coupon bonds and 102.60 for the seven-year floaters.</p>
<p>Greece imposed a 7.5 percent witholding tax on interest income from securities issued from January 1. Capital gains are not taxed. --Dimitris Kontogiannis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
