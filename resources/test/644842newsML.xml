<p>Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Friday Indonesia was withdrawing from a U.S. military training programme and was dropping its planned purchase of nine U.S. F-16 warplanes due to opposition in the U.S. Congress.</p>
<p>Alatas told a news conference Jakarta appreciated its relations with the administration of U.S. President Bill Clinton and was making these moves to avoid further friction.  </p>
<p>The foreign minister said the decision was conveyed in a letter from President Suharto to Clinton dated May 26 but only sent on June 2 due to technical reasons.</p>
<p>He said Suharto hoped that the removal of frictions linked to Congressional criticism of Indonesia would allow the two countries to press ahead on important political, economic and security issues.</p>
<p>Alatas said the decision was not linked to criticism by the U.S. State Department of the conduct of Indonesia's general elections last week, in which the ruling Golkar won a sweeping victory.</p>
