<p>Shares in British Aerospace Plc jumped in early trade on Thursday as the market hailed what dealers and analysts called a slightly better-than-expected 75 percent jump in first-half pretax profits.</p>
<p>BAe shares, among the six most-heavily traded stocks in pre-market trade, were up 11p at 1,023-1/2p at 0709 GMT while the overall market was indicated barely changed.</p>
<p>"The figures did come in above forecasts. There was an upbeat statement and better cash position than expected," Paul Pickford, analyst at Panmure Gordon in London, said.  </p>
<p>The company said pretax profit rose to 199 million stg in the first six months from 114 million a year earlier and raised its dividend to 6.25p from five pence.</p>
<p>Net cash rose to 511 million stg at the end of June from 63 million a year ago.</p>
<p>"It really looks a good performance and the figures are a shade above expectations," one marketmaker said.</p>
