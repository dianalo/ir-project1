<p>The dollar fell against the yen Tuesday, extending overnight losses after a troika of Japanese economic leaders voiced concern over the recent dollar rally.</p>
<p>Late in U.S. trade, the dollar was again hit by negative comments --  this time from Gail Fosler, chief economist at the Conference Board, a private economic research firm.</p>
<p>Fosler told an audience in Washington that the dollar was 15 percent overvalued against the yen, fueling a brief flurry of dollar selling, dealers said.</p>
<p>The dollar slipped to just below 115 yen on the news before bargain-hunters emerged to bolster the currency.  </p>
<p>"The Conference Board is just an independent group, but the dollar has been trading heavily for the last couple of days, so it was poised for some retracement on a comment like that," said Russell Lascala, chief spot trader at Citibank.</p>
<p>The dollar closed lower at 115.23/28 yen from 115.38/48 at the open and an overnight high of 115.98. The dollar edged higher to 1.5640/45 marks from 1.5610/20 in uninspired trade.</p>
<p>The comments came one day after similar remarks from a Japanese finance official caused a dollar slide and reinforced perceptions that Japan may act to slow the dollar's ascent.</p>
