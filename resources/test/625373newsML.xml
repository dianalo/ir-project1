<p>South Africa recorded a surprise fall in gross domestic product (GDP) in the first quarter of 1997, confounding economists' expectations and sparking renewed hopes of an interest rate cut.</p>
<p>Seasonally adjusted and annualised GDP fell 0.8 percent in the first quarter of 1997 after rising 3.3 percent at market prices in the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>The negative growth -- the first since the first quarter of 1994 -- was mainly due to the decline of 34.1 percent in rate agricultural production.</p>
<p>Excluding agriculture, non-agricultural GDP recorded a positive growth rate of 1.4 percent in the first quarter, the CSS said.</p>
<p>The figure was a shock to analysts who had been expecting an increase in overall GDP of around 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>But stocks and bonds cheered the weak economic data which dealers said could force Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals to cut current high interest that critics say are strangling the economy.</p>
<p>South Africa's official Bank rate is currently set at 17 percent while commercial banks' prime lending rate is 20.25 percent, a real interest rate of over 10 percent after allowing for inflation.</p>
