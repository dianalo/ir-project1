<p>British Lions captain Martin Johnson and number eight Tim Rodber will make their first appearances in the South African tour this Saturday in what is widely seen as a shadow Lions side for the first test against the Sprigboks.</p>
<p>Although Lions manager Fran Cotton stressed that the selectors were still trying out various playing combinations, the 15 named to square up to Western Province in Cape Town this weekend are close to a first-choice line-up.</p>
<p>"We are still looking at various combinations and this shouldn't be considered as our test team," Cotton said.</p>
<p>Leicester lock Johnson will make his debut as tour captain after a much-needed break from the demanding northern hemisphere season while Rodber completes an impressive all-England back row, despite still carrying five stitches in a head wound.</p>
<p>Rodber was picked for the tour opener in Port Elizabeth eight days ago but then had to withdraw with a stomach virus.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Lions side appears fairly strong.</p>
<p>Bath centre Jeremy Guscott, who impressed in the first game against an Eastern Province invitation side, joins strong-running Allan Tait in the midfield while Welshman Ieuan Evans and John Bentley provide pace and experience on the wings.</p>
<p>Gregor Townsend and Rob Howley have a second chance to impress at halfback while Jason Leonard, Barry Williams and Graham Rowntree make up a formidable front row.</p>
<p>The Lions management will hope that Neath hooker Williams can provide accurate throwing to both Johnson and Simon Shaw in the lineouts - an area of some concern for them in the first two matches.</p>
<p>Although the Lions have won their opening two matches on tour, Wednesday's 18-14 victory over Border in sodden conditions was far from convincing.</p>
<p>"Yesterday was very disappointing," said match captain Rob Wainwright. "We didn't control the game throughout - and there's only so much excuse you can make for the poor conditions."</p>
<p>But Lions media liaison officer Bob Burrows was able to give positive news on the injury front, regarding both centre Scott Gibbs and scrumhalf Austin Healey.</p>
<p>"Scott is already in Cape Town and had hydrotherapy treatment this morning. His doctor told me today he has nothing more serious than a sprained ankle - X-rays disclosed no fracture - and he should be fit to play again within seven and 10 days," Burros told Reuters.</p>
<p>"Austin took a slight knock on the shoulder yesterday but it's nothing serious."</p>
<p>British Lions team: Tim Stimpson; Ieuan Evans, Jeremy Guscott, Allan Tait, John Bentley; Gregor Townsend, Rob Howley; Tim Rodber, Richard Hill, Lawrence Dallaglio, Simon Shaw, Martin Johnson (captain), Jason Leonard, Barry Williams, Graham Rowntree. Sbstitutes: Neil Jenkins, Matt Dawson, Will Greenwood, Mark Regan, Phil Wallace, Scott Quinnell.</p>
