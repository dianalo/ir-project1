<p>Greece's Public Power Corporation (PPC) announced it stands ready effective May 12 to compensate its customers in cases where it fails to provide standard services.</p>
<p>"Standing by the obligations assumed against its subscribers, the PPC will introduce the Charter of Obligations to Consumers on May 12 1997," the utility said in a statement.</p>
<p>The charter calls for providing warranties on services offered to PPC's clientele and paying fines to customers when it fails to meet certain quality standards.</p>
<p>Set at 5,000 drachmas ($18), the fine is of "symbolic" nature.</p>
<p>"The amount (5,000 drachmas) will be proof of the PPC's willingness to offer quality services and of its confidence as to personnel capabilities," it said.</p>
<p>The Charter of Obligations to Consumers includes services pertaining to the maximum response time for repair works, new connections and re-connections.</p>
