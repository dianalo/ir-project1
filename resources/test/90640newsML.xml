<p>After two months of sanctions, Burundi's economy is in bad shape but the mainly Tutsi residents of the capital show little sign of submission.</p>
<p>A frequent analysis is that the almost total embargo imposed by regional states is making the Tutsi minority more stubborn and could undermine Major Pierre Buyoya, the leader described as a "moderate" in a land of extremism.</p>
<p>"The sanctions are radicalising people. The Tutsis are not panicking but there's a kind of resignation, of telling the outside world 'do your worst'".</p>
<p>This assessment was made by a local businessman in the hi-tech sector who had just laid off half his 20 workers because he has no goods to sell and no clients wanting to buy.</p>
<p>Landlocked Burundi's neighbours imposed the sanctions on July 31 to punish the Tutsi army for staging a coup six days earlier and installing Buyoya as head of state.</p>
<p>It was the climax of three years -- and arguably three decades -- of violence between Tutsis who control the levers of power and majority Hutus fighting to take over.</p>
<p>Pro-sanctions nations insist Buyoya must hold unconditional talks with Hutu rebel leaders before the embargo can be even partly lifted. Some foreign diplomats warn that such talks may push harder-line Tutsis to topple Buyoya, a former president who paved the way for short-lived Hutu majority rule in 1993.</p>
<p>Such analysts say most Tutsis, only 15 percent of Burundi's six million people, are simply not prepared to accept Hutu rule or real power-sharing, fearing annihilation similar to the genocide in neighbouring Rwanda in 1994.</p>
<p>"As long as they can pay military salaries and supply beer, any regime can hold Bujumbura and survive indefinitely," one foreign aid worker commented.</p>
<p>Information Minister Pierre-Claver Ndayicariye says there can be no doubting Buyoya's readiness to negotiate with the rebels and so no justification for sanctions.</p>
<p>"The embargo will kill the poor, the sick and the vulnerable first. Do you think the political class is hit by sanctions, here or in Iraq?" he asked Reuters.</p>
<p>But he said public morale was high because of a belief that Buyoya can restore peace after 150,000 deaths in the past three years of ethnic war.</p>
<p>The sanctions have blocked all official exports and imports and cut transport links. The only flights to Bujumbura are by the World Food Programme (WFP) twice a week from Kenya, ferrying U.N. and aid agency staff and some humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p>Burundi's coffee, up to 80 percent of usual export earnings, is stored. A senior official at Ocibu, the coffee marketing board, said it now holds about a third of annual exports.</p>
<p>Government hard currency reserves are a secret but with no foreign receipts and a sharp decline in tax revenue, they are running down. There is talk of fresh recruitment into the overwhelmingly Tutsi army, already over 20,000 strong, which will further drain the coffers.</p>
<p>Civil servants, including security forces, will be paid on time this week, finance ministry sources said. But the private sector is crippled with thousands of workers laid off by the large textile and construction companies.</p>
<p>Only the brewery is working almost normally. Taxes on beer -- a vital ingredient for army morale -- and soft drinks are the main source of government revenue.</p>
<p>Petrol rationing has sent the black market price to as much as four times the official one. Smuggled petrol from Zaire reaches Bujumbura by canoe across Lake Tanganyika or by cyclists who easily flout Zaire's official support for sanctions.</p>
