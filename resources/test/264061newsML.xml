<p>All of the hostages seized by Peruvian rebels at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima are held in one large room with glass windows, apparently to deter any police attack, a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>"We learned that the guerrilla group faxed Peru media organisations," the spokesman Ken Shimanouchi told a news briefing early on Thursday.</p>
<p>"This fax said the hostages were being held in one large room with glass windows, meaning that if there were any explosions there would be many injured."</p>
<p>The hostages include Peruvian Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela and Japanese Ambassador Morihisa Aoki as well as the ambassadors to Peru from at least 15 other countries.</p>
<p>Shimanouchi said they also included at least 120 Japanese nationals or Peruvians of Japanese ancestry.</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda was expected to leave Tokyo around midday (0300 GMT) for Lima to help in trying to resolve the crisis.</p>
