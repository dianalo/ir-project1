<p>Shares in UK banking stocks dropped on Tuesday in what some traders said was a bout of institutional profit-taking in one of the UK's strongest sectors of the year so far, traders said.</p>
<p>National Westminster Bank Plc was down 9p at 658 by 0932 GMT, Barclays Plc was down 8-1/2p at 931, HSBC Holdings Plc was down 17-1/2p at 11.85-1/2 and Abbey National Plc was down 7p at 606-1/2.</p>
<p>HSBC was additionally weighed down by comments from Hang Seng Bank chief executive Alexander Au that profit margins were likely to come under pressure in the second half of the year.  </p>
<p>"The banks opened quite strongly but we saw some quite aggressive selling across the board," said the head of equity trading at one brokerage.</p>
<p>"I would say it is just profit-taking after their recent massive outperformance."</p>
<p>But others played down talk of institutional profit-taking and said volumes in the stocks were not large enough to suggest large-scale selling.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the sector had been victim of market jitters ahead of today's U.S. interest rate decision, with the Federal Reserve's policy making committee expected to raise rates a quarter point.</p>
<p>Yet with recent economic data giving a mixed picture on the economy, some believe a half-point or even no change is possible -- and the bond market reaction to each of those possibilities is yet to be tested.</p>
<p>"What we are seeing may be nervousness ahead of the FOMC meeting," said Peter Toeman, analyst at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett.  </p>
<p>"History shows the relative performance of banking stocks has been closely tied to movements in U.S. long bond yields."</p>
<p>John Tyce, analyst at SG Strauss Turnbull, said he issued "sell" recommendations today on Barclays and Standard Chartered Plc, down 16p at 702-1/2 amid worries about margins in its Asian operations after Hang Seng's comments.</p>
<p>"The sector has gone stonkingly well," he said, "and banks tend to wobble with U.S. rates."</p>
