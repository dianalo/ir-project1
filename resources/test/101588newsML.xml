<p>Shell Oil and Mobil said late Tuesday crude oil output in the U.S. Gulf had not been fully restored since being shut down.</p>
<p>Production was reduced over the weekend as a precaution against Josephine, the tropical storm that moved through the Gulf of Mexico, making landfall in Florida last night.</p>
<p>Shell operates the Mars platform where 25,000 barrels per day (bpd) of sour crude was shut-in.</p>
<p>"Mars is not back in production. The workers will be doing some minor repairs before bringing it back up," a Shell company spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>She added she was not sure when capacity would be fully restored and did not disclose the nature of the repairs.</p>
<p>Separately, some portion of Mobil's 20,000 bpd of gross crude output has not returned to normal flows, with natural gas production still completely out.</p>
<p>"Some crude production has been brought back, but no gas production yet," said Chris Springham, spokesman for Mobil, adding that damage assessment was being carried out.</p>
<p>Mobil's field has a capacity of about 30 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) of gas.</p>
