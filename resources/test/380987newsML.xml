<p>Debris on the Imola race track may have caused the crash that killed Brazilian Formula One driver Ayrton Senna in 1994, a British newspaper said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Sunday Times published a photograph showing a small piece of debris in the path of Senna's Williams car moments before he crashed into a wall at Imola's Tamburello curve during the opening laps of the San Marino Grand Prix.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the fragment may have come from a collision between a Benetton car and a Lotus at the beginning of the race.</p>
<p>"There, clearly in the path of the Williams, lies a piece of what is probably, judging by its colour, Benetton bodywork," the newspaper said.</p>
<p>It suggested that Senna, three times world champion, may have jinked the steering wheel to avoid the debris, hit a bump and lost control of his car. At the time of the crash, his tyre pressure was low, making the car vulnerable to bumps, it said.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the picture, by a French motor racing photographer, had not been published before but had been given to the Williams Formula One team.</p>
<p>Team chief Frank Williams and five other people go on trial in Italy on Thursday charged with manslaughter over Senna's death.</p>
<p>An expert report compiled for the Italian investigators concluded that the car's steering column had snapped as a result of a faulty modification.</p>
<p>The Sunday Times also aired a theory that Senna may have blacked out moments before the crash, saying he had told a friend that he liked to hold his breath for the opening lap of a race because he believed this heightened his senses.</p>
<p>It said film from the small television camera mounted on his car showed that he was leaning sharply to the left just before the crash, suggesting that he might have lost consciousness.</p>
