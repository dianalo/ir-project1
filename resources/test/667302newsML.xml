<p>The administration is "cautiously optimistic" that President Clinton's decision to renew China's Most Favored Nation trade status will be upheld in the House, Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I think there is reason for cautious optimism all around," Eizenstat told reporters ahead of a House Ways and Means trade subcommittee hearing on China MFN.  </p>
<p>Eizenstat said he had been canvassing members of the House to see where they stand on the issue. "I have been encouraged both in my calls to Republicans and Democratic members," he said.</p>
<p>The full House is expected to vote on China MFN next week.</p>
<p>Eizenstat said President Clinton was in an even stronger position in the Senate despite Majority Leader Trent Lott's comments on Sunday that China MFN could be in trouble in the Senate because of concerns about the probe into allegations that China tried to influence U.S. elections through illegal contributions.</p>
<p>Administration officials and China MFN supporters hope that a resolution to overturn Clinton's decision will be defeated in the House. If it is defeated in the House it is unlikely to go forward in the Senate.</p>
<p>Despite its name, Most Favored Nation trade status is only denied to a handful of countries.</p>
