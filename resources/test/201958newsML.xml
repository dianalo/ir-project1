<p>The Zimbabwe dollar was quoted stable on the rand but weakened against other hard currencies as import pressure stepped up on Wednesday morning, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The market is kind of quiet at the moment but it has already lost a cent from where we opened on the back of importer demand. I believe there should be more activity later on because it looks like there's more importer demand than there are export receipts," a dealer commented.</p>
<p>At around 0800 GMT, the local unit was trading at 10.6850/7050 against the U.S. dollar, down from 10.6750/6950 overnight and also lost a few cents to 17.9240/9680 from 17.8700/9140 against pound sterling.</p>
<p>It was quoted at 7.1080/1230 versus the mark compared with Tuesday's 7.1000/1150 close, but held steady against the rand at 2.2990/3070. --Stella Mapenzauswa, Harare Newsroom: +263-4 72 52 28/9--</p>
