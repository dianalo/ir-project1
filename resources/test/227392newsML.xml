<p>Russian opposition to NATO's plans to expand eastwards has reached a new crescendo on the eve of a European security summit in a coordinated attack designed to increase Moscow's leverage at the meeting.</p>
<p>The tough line taken by Russian leaders in the past week has raised the prospect of a row over NATO souring the atmosphere, just as it did at the last summit of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Budapest in 1994.</p>
<p>This time President Boris Yeltsin will not be present because he is recovering from heart surgery. But his stand-in, Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, is expected to keep up the barrage of opposition when he addresses the Lisbon OSCE meeting at its opening on Monday.</p>
<p>In a signal preparing NATO for the worst, Defence Minister Igor Rodionov has, apparently for the first time, outlined publicly the measures Moscow might take if or when the Western alliance takes on new members from eastern and central Europe.</p>
<p>In a long newspaper article last Thursday, Rodionov said NATO enlargement would jeopardise arms talks, force Moscow to seek allies elsewhere and rethink its military doctrine, and consider pointing its nuclear missiles at eastern Europe.</p>
<p>"It is entirely possible that we will face a need to strengthen our southern, western and northwestern groups of forces without looking at the agreement limiting conventional weapons in Europe," he wrote in the daily Nezavisimaya Gazeta.</p>
<p>"It could even come to us redirecting our missiles at certain European countries entering NATO (all the more so if these countries agree to alliance nuclear weapons being positioned on their territory)."</p>
<p>Opposition to NATO's plans to take in former members of the now defunct Soviet-led Warsaw Pact is one of the few issues upon which Russian politicians widely agree. They fear it will threaten Russia's security.</p>
<p>But officials have wavered in the past few months between strident attacks on NATO expansion and sounding conciliatory, at times contradicting themselves and making policy appear vague.</p>
<p>There have even been private suggestions from senior Russian officials that Moscow could now be ready to accept a limited form of NATO enlargement under certain conditions.</p>
<p>Rodionov made clear that, with Yeltsin on the mend after his heart problems, efforts are being made to improve coordination between the Kremlin, the government, and the foreign and defence ministries over policy on NATO.</p>
<p>"The more successful this coordination is, then the more advantageous for Russia will be the treaties and agreements that are signed," he said.</p>
<p>Such thinking is clearly behind Moscow stepping up attacks on NATO's expansion plans in the last few days, when Yeltsin and Chernomyrdin have taken a hard line.</p>
<p>Russia hopes to win support at the OSCE summit for its proposals to increase the organisation's role in European security so that it acts as a counterbalance to NATO.</p>
<p>Although its chances of winning such support are minimal, Moscow believes that, by taking a hard line on NATO enlargement, it is more likely to win concessions in talks on other issues at the summit, including adapting a 1990 treaty on conventional arms.</p>
<p>Russian officials also believe that, even if NATO's growth is inevitable, keeping up fierce opposition provides their best hope of winning terms which would make it as palatable as possible for the Russian public.</p>
<p>Even Chernomyrdin's trip to Lisbon was unacceptable for some nationalists in the opposition-dominated parliament who say that the Kremlin's vision of a future OSCE will be ignored by other states and that Russia will remain isolated.</p>
<p>"Why go there when they don't want us and will only laugh at us?" nationalist deputy Alexei Mitrofanov told Reuters last week. "This is not serious diplomacy and will only lower the country's prestige."</p>
<p>Such views back in Moscow oblige Chernomyrdin and Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov to sound tough on NATO expansion.</p>
<p>They also increase the likelihood of NATO's enlargement plans returning to haunt the OSCE as in Budapest, when Yeltsin warned of a "cold peace" replacing the Cold War.</p>
