<p>Chinese Premier Li Peng arrives in Brazil on Thursday on the second leg of a three-nation Latin American tour, determined to push trade and commerce but likely to skirt human rights issues, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Brazilian officials said Brasilia hoped the four-day official visit will strengthen economic ties between Latin America's largest country and the booming Asian powerhouse.</p>
<p>But they said Brazil, which has come under fire from human rights groups for police abuses and violence in the countryside, had no intention of touching on civil liberties.</p>
<p>"This is an important opportunity to revise and strengthen our relations," said Vera Machado, director general of the Brazilian Foreign Ministry's Asia and Oceania department.</p>
<p>"We do not expect to broach the issue of human rights but if the Chinese bring it up, we'll talk," she said.</p>
<p>Li's tour of Brazil, which will take him and a 166-member delegation to Brasilia, Sao Paulo and the Amazonian capital Manaus, comes almost a year after Brazil's President, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, travelled to Beijing.</p>
<p>Since then visiting Chinese ministers have visited, many discussing greater cooperation in agriculture, a subject dear to the hearts of the Chinese -- struggling to feed 1.2 billion people.</p>
<p>Bilateral trade totalled $2.243 billion in 1995, sharply up from $1.286 billion the year before. Brazilian officials said they believed there was considerable room for improvement.</p>
<p>Closest cooperation to date lies in a joint-venture to produce Earth-monitoring satellites, a $150 million project that foresees the launch of the first of four satellites next October.</p>
<p>Officials said Li would sign three accords in Brasilia: one on further satellite cooperation, another on the environment and a third allowing Brazil to maintain its consulate in Hong Kong after the British colony is handed back to Beijing next July.</p>
<p>Foodstuff talks are likely to play a significant role and Li will visit Brasilia's agricultural research agency.</p>
<p>Despite persistent market talk that Chinese firms have been considering buying up soybean plantations in Brazil, the Foreign Ministry's Machado said no formal proposals were made. She added, however, it was expected to be a "priority subject".</p>
<p>On the trade front, Li was certain to bring up recent Brazilian moves to stem imports from China and other Asian countries, such as quotas on textiles, punitive tariffs on toys and a 288.5 percent tariff on pencil imports.</p>
<p>But officials said no hostility was expected and Brazil would voice support for Beijing's bid to be admitted to the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>Li, who arrived in Chile on Wednesday, travels to Venezuela next Tuesday.</p>
