<p>The Asian bullion trade stepped back from the market on Tuesday to allow gold to continue its overnight slide to over 18-month lows, and dealers predicted further losses would follow as selling pressure mounted.</p>
<p>"After gold broke below strong support at $380 per ounce without facing much resistance, I would not rule out a slip to around $375," an official at one Tokyo-based bullion house said.  </p>
<p>Spot gold was quoted at $377.90/$378.40 an ounce in Hong Kong  at midday on Tuesday against the close on Monday in New York of $378.20/$378.60 and London's fix at $379 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Gold has been battered by the strength of the dollar, particulary against the yen, the attractiveness of alternative investments in strong bond and equity markets and the weakness of demand in related silver and platinum group metals.</p>
<p>Japanese dealers said gold's price outlook now hinges on when massively short U.S. funds might cover their positions or Australian producers start selling.  </p>
<p>The latest U.S. CFTC Commitment of Traders Report showed that large non-commercial short positions on the New York Mercantile Exchange's COMEX division had surged to more than 65,000 lots, or 6.5 million ounces, as of September 24, versus long positions of fewer than 10,000 lots.</p>
<p>"We believe speculators that went short at around $380 may wait until about $375 to take profits," the Tokyo bullion house official said.</p>
<p>Gold option volatilities remained fairly neutral, traders said, adding that few players wanted to buy short term options at the moment. "Everyone's watching their positions," one said.  </p>
<p>A dealer at a foreign bank in Japan added that Australian producers may soon be tempted to sell, having bought back production a few months ago when gold prices were weak, only to watch prices move even lower during the latest slide.</p>
<p>A strong Australian dollar meant some producers were also tempted to buy Australian dollars and sell gold, a Hong Kong dealer commented, adding that Australian gold volatilities were at a two percent premium over U.S. gold volatilities, and flatter across the three-month gold level.  </p>
<p>Tokyo and Hong Kong dealers said that in earlier trade on Tuesday, Australian producers were quiet and there was little sign of physical demand from Asian sources.</p>
<p>"As Asian investors aleady bought significant amounts of gold around $380 and $381, they'll probably wait for weaker prices before buying more," one Japanese dealer said.</p>
<p>"We got some sell orders from Europe earlier this morning," said one gold dealer in Hong Kong, adding that the orders were speculative sales. Gold is expected to sink further and trade in the $375-$377 range, industry sources said.  </p>
<p>Chartists in the U.K territory pointed to gold's 14-day Relative Strength Index (RSI) showing at 25.31 percent, indicating an oversold level, but said that sentiment still remained bearish.</p>
<p>"Prices are going down and where they end, nobody knows," said one Hong Kong source, adding that at some point demand was expected to kick in to stabilise the plunge.</p>
<p>"The wave of physical support that was supposed to drown us all, plainly hasn't happened," he added.  </p>
<p>Japan's physical demand, in particular, is unlikely to get a lift from the recent fall in prices, as the yen's weakening against the dollar offset the drop in dollar-based gold prices.</p>
<p>The latest trade data showed that during the first eight months of this year Japan's gold imports totalled 105 tonnes, barely more than half the 199 tonnes imported during the same period last year.</p>
<p>Japan's lacklustre demand for palladium and platinum, due in part to sluggishness in the semiconductor sector, has also helped turn market sentiment negative toward gold.</p>
