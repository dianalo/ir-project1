<p>North Korea has agreed to a meeting of senior officials with South Korea, the United States and China to arrange four-way peace talks, Seoul government sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Pyongyang has accepted a suggestion that senior officials from the two Koreas, the United States and China meet around early August to set an agenda and other details for the peace talks," one source said.</p>
<p>The four-nation talks, proposed jointly by U.S. President Bill Clinton and South Korean President Kim Young-sam in April last year, aim to work out a peace settlement to replace a now-fraying armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.</p>
<p>Wednesday marks the 47th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean conflict.</p>
<p>The sources said senior officials from the two Koreas and the United States would first meet in New York early next week to announce an accord for the "preparatory talks".</p>
<p>Seoul foreign ministry spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung declined to confirm the North Korean agreement but said: "There will be an announcement on four-way peace talks at 10:00 p.m. (1300 GMT) today." A similar announcement was due in Washington at the same time, Lee added.</p>
<p>South Korean Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha has said that he was "cautiously optimistic" over the prospects of holding peace talks this year.</p>
<p>Famine-threatened North Korea in April agreed in principle to join the four-nation talks but made its participation conditional on large-scale food aid and an easing of U.S. trade sanctions.</p>
<p>South Korea and the United States have said such assistance could be discussed during peace talks.</p>
<p>"Seoul and Washington have been actively taking part in humanitarian assistance to help stave off a catastrophe in the North. This might have contributed to creating a better atmosphere," another government source said.</p>
<p>The United States has pledged $25 million and South Korea $16 million in response to the United Nations World Food Programme's most recent appeal for 203,000 tonnes of food for North Korea, or $95.5 million.</p>
