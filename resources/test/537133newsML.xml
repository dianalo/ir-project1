<p>The raging Red River receded slightly in flood-ravaged Grand Forks on Wednesday, but the swollen river broadened its destructive path into Canada, forcing thousands more people to evacuate.</p>
<p>The swollen river, littered with floating telephone poles, car-sized icebergs and animal carcasses, had forced Grand Forks residents to flee their homes but officials said the waters were now starting to abate.</p>
<p>"The river's receding slowly so we are in the recovery phase, which is good news," feisty Grand Forks Mayor Pat Owens said. The National Weather Service said the river level had fallen about 10 inches (25 cm) from its crest this week of just over 54 feet (16.4 metres).</p>
<p>Downstream toward the Canadian border, the river had spread as wide as 30 to 40 miles (48 to 64 km) across the flat plain, North Dakota's Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad said.</p>
<p>Three people were presumed drowned in Manitoba's rising flood waters and the province ordered 17,500 people evacuated from their homes. Thousands of livestock were shipped by truck to safety.</p>
<p>In Grand Forks, a few residents entered a newly dry neighbourhood inside the evacuation zone to survey the damage to their homes, but officials warned against the practice until inspectors could assess the safety of the electrical system and the threat of contamination from the sewage-laden floodwaters.</p>
<p>Owens asked for patience from Grand Forks' 45,000 evacuees, and she urged them not to flee the city for good.</p>
<p>"Be upbeat, try to find something to do," she suggested. "In a week or so, we'll have more than we can handle."</p>
<p>Those forced to evacuate late last week after the river overwhelmed dikes protecting this city of 50,000 people have scattered to emergency shelters and homes across the state, and in some cases across the country.</p>
<p>With fresh water from the city's still-submerged and contaminated water plant weeks away and workers struggling to maintain power and telephone service, a return to normalcy remained a dim prospect.</p>
<p>Many have gone days without a bath, regular hot food or any measure of privacy as they share space with fellow evacuees. The Air Force base outside Grand Forks had temporarily run short of water and was forced to curtail showers for the 600 people still sheltering in an airplane hangar.</p>
<p>American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole arrived at the air base's shelter, a day after a visit from President Bill Clinton, and chatted with several flood refugees.</p>
<p>"The spirit is wonderful; neighbour helping neighbour. When people go through a traumatic situation like this, it's good to have some help, some counselling," Dole said.</p>
<p>Jeff Boe, 25, who likely lost everything in the Grand Forks flood, greeted Dole warmly. "It's helped to see the president yesterday and Mrs. Dole today," he said. "These are going to be a really hard couple of months."</p>
<p>Clinton had suggested that house trailers be brought to the edge of the flood zone for residents needing to clean up or rebuild. Mayor Owens said college dormitory rooms may be utilized.</p>
<p>Several of those who tried to wait out the high water in the flood zone were being rescued after surviving the fierce blaze that gutted sections of downtown last weekend.</p>
<p>Sen. Byron Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, said one stunned evacuee told him he had watched telephone poles, huge ice chunks and dead cows float by his window in the swift current. "It's eerie to see a city with water on the streets and no people," Dorgan said.</p>
<p>Two small North Dakota towns, Drayton and Pembina, were in a desperate race on Wednesday to build up leaking dikes as residents were told to collect crucial belongings and go.</p>
<p>"We're alright for now but the river is coming up," said Merl Defoe, a volunteer helping reinforce Drayton's clay, sandbag and wood barriers.</p>
<p>Runoff from a record winter snowpack, some of it spilling unimpeded over the landscape, covered parts of a key highway running the length of the river valley to Winnipeg, Manitoba, the next large community in the path of the floodwaters.</p>
<p>Three people, including a 40-year-old kayaker missing since Tuesday and two boys aged 14 and four, were presumed drowned in Manitoba's rising flood waters.</p>
<p>In Winnipeg, officials were confident the city's 29-mile long (47 km), 30-foot (9-metre) deep crescent-shaped floodway whould protect most of the its 630,000 residents from the floodwaters, which were rising rapidly.</p>
