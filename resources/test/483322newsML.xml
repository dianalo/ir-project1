<p>Software developer Computershare Systems Pty Ltd said on Wednesday it had signed a contract to supply an automated trading and settlement system for the Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE) to replace its current open outcry system.</p>
<p>The CSE required Computershare to provide a ready-to-operate system servicing the CSE's 20 member firms who would operate initially from a central trading hall, Computershare said.</p>
<p>Computershare Systems Pty Ltd is 49 percent owned by Computershare Ltd. It did not specify the value of the contract.  </p>
<p>The Cyprus system was based on Computershare software already installed in the Shanghai, Jakarta and Surabaya stock exchanges and the Moscow and Kazakhstan interbank currency exchanges.</p>
<p>The system was also recently selected by the Helsinki Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>CSE President Dinos Papadopoulos said in a Computershare statement the automation of the exchange was a key step in its expansion plans, "giving us the capacity to diversify the instruments traded by adding futures and options at the appropriate time."  </p>
<p>"There will be additional opportunities for the listing of foreign securities and offshore companies," he said.</p>
