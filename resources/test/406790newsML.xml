<p>Juventus supporters turning out to see their familiar heroes against Vicenza in the league on Saturday will be disappointed.</p>
<p>The league leaders and European Cup holders, who last weekend embarked on a cycle of seven tough matches in a month against key opponents, have been struck down by a wave of injuries just when they can least afford it.</p>
<p>Alessandro Del Piero, the instrumental 22-year-old international attacker, was sidelined for at least a month on Wednesday when he pulled a thigh muscle in training.</p>
<p>The club's most valued player, Del Piero seems certain to miss both European Cup quarter-finals next month against Norway's Rosenborg as well as vital league matches coming up after Vicenza against Inter, Napoli and Roma.</p>
<p>Del Piero's injury means Italy will probably have to play Moldova in a World Cup qualifier without him and quite possibly the more crucial match against Poland on April 2.</p>
<p>The brilliant striker had previously been the mainstay of a team already suffering absences and had been due to partner 30-year-old Michele Padovano up front.</p>
<p>Padovano, a player rejected by Juventus as a youth but repeatedly proving his worth this season as a deadly finisher and one of the fastest strikers in the business, will be joined by young Christian Vieri in an emergency attack.</p>
<p>Croat Alen Boksic, who suffered an ankle injury on January 12, has been due to return for the Vicenza match but complications make his comeback extremely unlikely.</p>
<p>French midfielder Zinedine Zidane, whose genius would make all the difference, is serving a one match ban.</p>
<p>Compatriot Didier Deschamps is doubtful due to an injury that prevented him from playing for France on Wednesday but he could yet make a sufficient recovery by Saturday while defender Sergio Porrini has a twisted left ankle.</p>
<p>Italy goalkeeper Angelo Peruzzi will also be absent due to a back strain that kept him off the team last weekend. In the meantime 34-year-old Michelangelo Rampulla plays.</p>
<p>Added to the long-term injury suffered by captain Antonio Conte, who is not due back until the end of May, the problems have caused a headache for coach Marcello Lippi.</p>
<p>Juventus lead the league with a five point advantage over Sampdoria and will stay top whatever the result.</p>
<p>But seventh-placed Vicenza, who were top before Christmas, are one of just two teams to have beaten them in the league this season. They are also chasing a hat-trick of wins against Juventus, having also won an encounter last season.</p>
<p>Juventus have only played three times this season without Del Piero and Boksic and one of those matches was in Vicenza when they suffered their first defeat of the season.</p>
<p>"I have to take stock of the situation," said Lippi.</p>
<p>"I am sorry for Del Piero above all because he was going through an excellent patch of form. But we're not going to pull our hair out. We'll try and overcome these problems."</p>
<p>Vicenza, with the exception of Uruguayan Marcelo Otero, have no stars of the calibre of the Juventus men -- the Vicenza salaries are reportedly the lowest in serie A -- and none of the injury problems either although fatigue is a worry.</p>
<p>The north-eastern club played in the league on Sunday and then had an emotionally-draining Italian Cup semifinal on Tuesday, reaching the final for the first time in 95 years.</p>
<p>Their league match against Juventus would usually have been on the Sunday but was brought forward because of the Turin team's European Cup match in Norway on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"You just have to say the name Juve," said coach Francesco Guidolin of the task his men face. "We managed to beat them at home, but they have won everything in Italy, in Europe and in the world...and it'll be our third game in five days.</p>
<p>"Believe me, on the home leg, Juve deserved far more than a defeat. They had us on the ropes."</p>
