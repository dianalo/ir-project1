<p>A senior U.S. poultry industry official said Wednesday he was not optimistic that an agreement would be reached this week between Washington and Brussels in ongoing talks on meat inspection rules, and seemed skeptical of a "temporary solution" offered by the EU.</p>
<p>Bill Roenigk, senior vice president of the National Broiler Council, said, "I'm not optimistic at this time ... I would be pleasantly surprised if they presented something to us we could accept."</p>
<p>Earlier Wednesday, EU's lead negotiator in the talks, Lars Hoelgaard, told reporters that the European Union has offered the United States a "temporary solution" for poultry import standards until a long-term solution can be worked out.</p>
<p>Hoelgaard did not give any details of the specifics of the plan, but said it would cover several months to allow the U.S. poultry industry to make requested adjustments.</p>
<p>U.S. and EU negotiators have been meeting this week in Washington to reach an agreement over veterinary equivalency rules before a looming April 1 deadline threatens to disrupt hundreds of millions of dollars of meat, poultry, dairy and pet food trade between the two nations.</p>
<p>An agreement would allow each side to accept meat and meat products from the other even if their safety inspection methods differ.</p>
<p>Roenigk said that industry groups will be briefed Thursday by the Agriculture Department on the talks. He commented that the U.S. poultry industry has already spelled out its "bottom line" in the dispute and is not sure how flexible its position is at this point, but said nevertheless "we're always willing to look at EU suggestions."</p>
<p>Hoelgaard warned that unless the EU proposal is accepted, the European Union will implement new harmonized import regulations for poultry, dairy, eggs and other products on April 1, and that incoming shipments could stop at that point.</p>
<p>The United States currently exports about $50 million worth of poultry to the European Union. Roenigk said the EU market could be much bigger if the EU would provide greater access to U.S. products.</p>
<p>"The market could be several times that big if we really had truly free trade," said Roenigk.</p>
<p>Roenigk maintained that the EU refusal to accept U.S. poultry inspection methods is really an attempt to raise a non-tarriff trade barrier, and that U.S. products are as wholesome, if not more wholesome, than European poultry.</p>
<p>At midday, negotiators were still meeting, and no details had been released from the talks.</p>
