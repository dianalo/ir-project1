<p>Leading National League Most Valuable Player candidate Ken Caminiti of the San Diego Padres underwent successful arthroscopic surgery on Wednesday to correct a shoulder injury.</p>
<p>Caminiti had his partially torn left rotator cuff surgically repaired at Centinela Hospital in Los Angeles, the team announced.</p>
<p>The All-Star third baseman, who won a Gold Glove award for fielding excellence earlier Wednesday, batted .326 with 40 homers and 130 RBI to lead the Padres to their first National League West Division title in 12 years.</p>
<p>Caminiti, who played all season with the injury, had three hits -- all home runs -- in the three-game sweep by the St Louis Cardinals in the divisional playoff series.</p>
<p>He is expected to remain hospitalized overnight and the shoulder will be placed in a splint for two weeks to protect the rotator cuff.</p>
<p>Caminiti was one of several Padres in need post-season medical attention.</p>
<p>Right-hander Andy Ashby underwent an MRI test to determine whether surgery is needed to repair the partially torn cartilage in his pitching shoulder.</p>
<p>Ashby was 9-5 with a 3.23 ERA in 25 starts during the season. He started Game Three against St Louis, allowing four runs and seven hits in 5 1/3 innings.</p>
<p>Seven-time batting champion Tony Gwynn had an MRI on his right heel on Tuesday. Results of the tests on Gwynn and Ashby were not immediately available.</p>
<p>Gwynn hit .353 during the season and .308 in San Diego's three playoff losses to St Louis.</p>
<p>Padres reserve infielder Craig Shipley Tuesday underwent surgery to repair injuries to his left hamstring and knee. He hit .315 during the season but did not play during the playoffs.</p>
