<p>Hungarian wheat futures dropped by the daily limit of 400 forints on Thursday due to a fall in prices on international markets on Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>"This happened because prices substantially dropped in Chicago," said Gabor Gyori of Order Brokerage.</p>
<p>He added that Chicago wheat prices rose on Thursday but Hungarian wheat futures were likely to drop further on Friday, although perhaps not so much as on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The wheat got a strong impetus today," he said.</p>
<p>Both milling and feed wheat futures fell by 400 forints on the Budapest Commodity Exchange (BCE), with milling wheat futures accounting for four-fifth of the bourse's grain turnover of 335 million forints, or 704 lots.</p>
<p>July and August were the most actively traded maturities for milling wheat, with July closing at 23,700 forints and August at 23,980.</p>
<p>Maize futures remained steady and traded in a low turnover of 22 lots.</p>
<p>"Everybody concentrates on the wheat now," Gyori said.</p>
<p>($1=180.56 Hungarian forints)</p>
