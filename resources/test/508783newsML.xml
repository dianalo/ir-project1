<p>American Airlines is selectively dropping its cargo fuel surcharge effective April 28 in the latest of a series of such moves by airlines around the world.</p>
<p>The carrier is scrapping the 10 cent a kg surcharge both ways across the Atlantic and to Latin America but is maintaining it on cross Pacific routes.  </p>
<p>AA vice-president of sales Mark Najarian said most airlines had maintained the surcharge on Pacific routes because of strong market conditions.</p>
<p>U.S.-Asia trade has been so strong that ocean lines have reported backups at U.S. west coast ports in recent weeks, the New York-based Journal of Commerce reported on Monday.</p>
<p>American did not have a fuel surcharge as such either domestically or on northbound routes from Latin America, said Najarian adding that fuel prices remain significantly higher than a year ago, but American is dropping the surcharge anyway to remain competitive.</p>
<p>With American's move, most airlines have dropped their surcharges on the north Atlantic. An exception so far has been British Airways. The surcharges were put into place last November to cope with a major spike in global jet fuel prices.</p>
<p>On Latin American routes, American's major competitors are carriers like Varig Brazilian, Polar Air Cargo and United Airlines all of which have dropped or are dropping their surcharges said Najarian.</p>
<p>April represents the start of the summer airline schedule, with increased levels of flying on the north Atlantic in particular, which means a great deal more cargo space to fill. April also brings a seasonal downturn in cargo traffic on the north Atlantic ahead of the summer shutdowns of manufacturing plants. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+5017</p>
