<p>The European Union's monetary committee reconvened for a second day of talks on Wednesday with the hope of breaking a deadlock over the details of a budget stability pact, sources said.</p>
<p>The group, comprised of national treasury and central bank officials, gathered late Tuesday and spent most of their time discussing Greece's economic convergence program.</p>
<p>While officials gave Greece high marks for the work it has done towards meeting the Maastricht treaty's economic criteria, it was encouraged to do more, sources said.</p>
<p>A budget stability pact and the European Commission's economic outlook for the EU is on Wednesday's agenda.</p>
<p>The meeting comes amid doubts over how much agreement there is on the details of a stability pact, designed to enforce budgetary rigour among governments taking part in European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Under the plan, governments running deficits in excess of three percent of total output would face an initial fine of 0.2 percent of GDP, with a further one percent of GDP penalty tacked on for every percentage point over the three percent threshold.</p>
<p>A maximum fine of 0.5 percent of output is envisaged.</p>
<p>EU monetary officials say Germany is expected to stand firm against a perceived watering down of its initial proposal.</p>
<p>In particular, Bonn is worried that governments might escape punitive sanctions should their economies suffer an economic downturn. A precise definition of what constitutes a recession is what Germany wants, sources said.</p>
<p>German officials also want the fine to be open-ended.</p>
<p>Officials now say agreement on a budget accord is unlikely before next year, with some expecting only a political declaration by EU leaders when they meet in Dublin on December 13-14.</p>
<p>Rounding out the session will be further work on a new Exchange Rate Mechanism, linking the single currency to countries on the perimeter of EMU, and legal issues regarding monetary union.</p>
<p>The results of Wednesday's meeting will form the basis for talks on EMU among EU finance ministers on November 11.</p>
