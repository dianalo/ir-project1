<headline>OPTIONS - FX vols subdued, but yen skew stays.</headline>

<p>Implied volatilities for dollar-pair options were subdued, despite an overnight rally in dollar/mark to a fresh 40-month high and the ongoing Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, traders said.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen risk reversals, the put/call pricing differential, remained sharply skewed for yen calls, even though the yen's overall volatility levels sagged, they added.</p>
<p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to keep U.S. interest rates unchanged at the FOMC meeting, which ends on Wednesday, and a long U.S. Independence Day weekend coming up, the gamma-rich shorter dates were particularly soft.  </p>
<p>"It's somewhat surprising with the dollar testing 1.75 (marks), but that's what we're seeing," said Ted Voorhees, a senior options trader at Deutsche Bank in New York.</p>
<p>He said gamma-selling had been persistent in the past week or so, with the weakness spilling over to vega-rich longer maturities now.</p>
<p>"The market is pretty much convinced that data for the U.S. economy is soft and that there will be no rate hike," said Soma Rao, first vice president and options sales manager at Smith Barney.  </p>
<p>One-month dollar/mark volatility stood at 7.9/8.2 percent, down more than a quarter point from late Monday levels. One-year was off marginally at 9.0/9.2 percent.</p>
<p>Traders added that 1.75 marks seemed to be a fairly big exotic option barrier price.</p>
<p>"It's a bit of a two-way struggle at around those levels," he said, noting that good dollar-selling interest had come in near 1.75 in the past few days. "Basically, I think we're range-bound ahead of FOMC and (Friday's) non-farm payrolls."</p>
<p>The dollar touched a high of 1.7488 marks earlier in the day before pulling back and bouncing off the 1.74 area again.  </p>
<p>The dollar/yen volatility curve, which had been inverted for most of the past two months after the dollar began tumbling, flipped back to positive as the short dates slid.</p>
<p>One-month dollar/yen stood at 9.9/10.1 percent, down three quarters of a point from late Monday levels, while one-year was off a quarter point at 10.2/10.4 percent.</p>
<p>Still, fear of a renewed dollar slide kept bids for yen calls strong relative to yen puts.</p>
<p>"There is still a perceived need for Japanese corporates to sell dollars, buy yen, and the risk of a further sharp move on the downside in dollar/yen cannot be ruled out," Rao said.  </p>
<p>Market-making banks are generally long in the upside strikes after taking on an avalanche of end-user yen call buying and put selling in recent weeks, traders said.</p>
<p>Because those upside exposures center on the 116-117 yen area, a dollar rally is likely to be dampened by dealers' delta-hedge dollar selling as gamma for those options picks up, providing bigger delta changes, Rao said.</p>
<p>In addition, dealers would be tempted to sell volatilities to trim time decay as those upside strikes become more theta-rich and vulnerable to time decay, traders said.</p>
