<p>Indian soldiers shot dead at least five Bodo guerrillas in a gun-battle in the northeastern state of Assam on Monday, a senior police official said.</p>
<p>The shootout occured in Baihata Chariali, some 20 km (12 miles) from the state capital of Guwahati, he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The gun-battle took place less than 12 hours after Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda rejected the Bodo tribesmen's demand for a separate province within Assam while on a six-day visit to the northeastern region.</p>
<p>The All Bodo Students Union, spearheading a movement for a separate "Bodoland," called a rally in Guwahati on Monday to display its strength and press the Indian government to fulfill their demand, its president, Urkhao Brahma, said.</p>
