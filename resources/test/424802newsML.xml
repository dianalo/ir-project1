<p>French supermarkets group Casino expects 1997 pre-tax pre-exceptional profit to rise around 22.2 percent, the annual average seen over the last five years, the company said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Growth in pre-tax pre-exceptional profit for 1997 "will be close to the average of the last five years," chairman Georges Plassat told an analysts' meeting on Casino's 1996 results.</p>
<p>Pre-tax pre-exceptional profit from 1992 to 1996 rose an average 22.2 percent, Casino executives said.</p>
<p>"We have everything we need to achieve an operating profit margin of three percent in 1999 on our French activities, compared to 2.5 percent in 1996, Plassat said.</p>
<p>With purchasing power of 101.8 billion francs in 1997, Casino believes it is is "well armed for the future".</p>
<p>Casino earlier reported 1996 net attributable profit up 32.4 percent at 838 million francs and pre-tax pre-exceptional gains rising 34.5 percent to 1.41 billion.</p>
<p>The company wants to improve its financial structure by 1999 with an increase in equity capital of 4.2 billion francs and cut debt by 4.5 billion francs.</p>
<p>"On a like-for-like basis, the group should be completely debt-free by 1999," Plassat said.</p>
<p>Casino, which is paying a 1996 net dividend of 4.50 francs per share, up from four francs, will not offer to pay the dividend in shares this year.</p>
<p>The company plans to expand its international investments. In 1996, spending abroad accounted for 28 percent of the total investment compared to 14 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Casino expects turnover to exceed 10 billion francs from its U.S. subsidiary Smart &amp; Final by 1999. The group plans to have 10 hypermarkets in Poland by the end of 1999, generating sales of four billion francs.</p>
<p>The group wants to to open two stores in Taiwan in 1998 and perhaps three more in 1999. It is also looking for new partners in Latin America.</p>
<p>As of March 4, the Rallye group held 28.1 percent of Casino's capital and 36.3 percent of the voting rights. Market regulators are expected to announce a waiver for a public offer by Rallye.</p>
<p>Other main Casino shareholders include the Guichard family with 7.6 percent of the capital and 14.6 percent of voting rights, an employee fund holds 1.2 percent, while Casino itself group holds treasury stock of 3.4 percent. Some 59.7 percent of the capital is in public hands.</p>
<p>Plassat declined to comment on rumours of a merger between Casino and Promodes and said that it was premature to talk about the partnerships being studied by the company.</p>
<p>"We have lots of alternatives," he said.</p>
