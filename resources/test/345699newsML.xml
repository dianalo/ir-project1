<headline>Brent higher in late US trading, WTI/Brent narrows.</headline>

<p>North Sea Brent was mixed in late U.S. trading Wednesday, with a major Wall Street player doing most of the buying, traders said.</p>
<p>Five partial paper March Brents changed hands: 300 lots at $22.76 a barrel, 100 lots at $22.80, 100 lots at $22.82, and two trades of 100 and 200 lots at $22.83, traders said.</p>
<p>March Brent settled at $22.76 a barrel on London's IPE.</p>
<p>March/April Brent traded at 47 cents, steady with the London close.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an erratic price environment seems to be putting a crimp in sales of foreign crudes into the U.S. Gulf Coast.</p>
<p>Even as CFDs and dated Brent have strengthened, the spread between West Texas Intermediate/Cushing and Brent for March has narrowed, lifting the price for delivered Brent into the Gulf Coast, traders said.</p>
<p>The WTI/Brent spread was around $1.65-70 a barrel, down five cents from Tuesday.</p>
<p>The going price for Brent deliveries into the Gulf Coast is now around WTI minus 20-25 cents for March barrels, compared to a discount of 30-40 cents a few days ago, traders said.</p>
<p>At least four companies are offering Brents for the first half of March, but only one refiner has bought so far, traders said.</p>
<p>"(The price change) makes it difficult to do anything. I think that's why nothing's gotten done," one trader said.</p>
