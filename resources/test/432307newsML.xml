<p>The Hoechst Schering AgrEvo gmbH joint venture Hoechst AG and Schering AG has sued DeKalb Genetics Corp for alleged infringement of Hoechst Schering's Liberty herbicide trademark.</p>
<p>In papers filed Monday in the Delaware Chancery Court, Hoechst sought an emergency order barring Dekalb from using the Liberty trademark with its products, specifically its seed corn. A hearing for a restraining order was scheduled for Tuesday at 2:30 P.M. before Vice Chancellor Bernard Balick.  </p>
<p>At issue is the Liberty herbicide which destroys weeds while leaving unharmed the corn plants grown from genetically engineered seed corn.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit, Hoechst Schering AgrEvo said it seeks to limit the use of its Liberty Link trademark to manufacturers of seed it has approved as resistant to the glufosinate in Liberty herbicide.</p>
<p>According to AgrEvo court documents, some companies claiming to have a Liberty resistant seed corn "in fact showed 75-80 percent plant mortality/injury when glufosinate was applied."  </p>
<p>"AgrEvo's sensitivity to the possibility of (crop damage) claims has recently been heightened by E.I. Dupont de Nemours &amp; CO's with Benlate brand herbicide in which claims for crop damage have run into the hundreds of millions of dollars," court papers say.</p>
<p>But Dekalb chief financial officer Thomas Rauman told Reuters that tests of its GR corn hybrids resistant to Liberty glufosinate herbicide "state quite the opposite of that."</p>
<p>"The efficacy of our product is as good or better than hybrids currently being sold under the AgrEvo label," Rauman said.  </p>
<p>On Monday Dekalb said it sued AgrEvo USA Co, also a plaintiff in the Delaware lawsuit, in federal court in Chicago. According to the statement, Dekalb alleged that AgrEvo knowingly made "false and misleading statements to farmers in an attempt to interfere with Dekalb's" seed corn.</p>
<p>Rauman said the total U.S. market for seed corn is about $2.1 billion, with replanting due in April and May.</p>
<p>"This is the first year that you've got Liberty-resistant corn being sold. This year the seed companies have introductory quantities of the product. The size of the market will be determined by how well the farmers accept this product and what alternatives they have," Rauman said.</p>
