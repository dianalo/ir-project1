<p>British water and sewerage company Yorkshire Water said a one-off tax on privatised utilities announced by the new Labour government on Wednesday was "unwelcome".</p>
<p>"We feel it is retrospective taxation which is bad news for investors," a company spokesman told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, announcing his first budget to parliament, said he aimed to raise a net 4.8 billion stg from a one-off tax on privatised utilities, including the impact of reducing a gas levy to zero.</p>
<p>Yorkshire Water said it had "never made excess profits and our operating profit has been less than that projected by the government when we were privatised in 1989".</p>
<p>The company spokesman added that Yorkshire was "disappointed the government thought fit to extract cash from a business with a massive capital investment programme ahead of it." -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717</p>
