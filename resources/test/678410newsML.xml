<p>European Commissioner Yves Thibault de Silguy, commenting on French calls for a flexible interpretation of the Maastricht treaty, said on Friday that the same rules must be applied to all member states.</p>
<p>"If all countries show (a public deficit/gross domestic product ratio) of 2.9 to 3.1 percent and one country shows 3.5 to four percent, that will be a problem," he told reporters during a summit of G7 rich nations plus Russia.</p>
<p>"The rules will be the same for all member states," he added.</p>
<p>He had been asked about speculation that France's new Socialist-led government might insist on a very loose interpretation of Maastricht treaty criteria for membership of a single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said during his election campaign that he would not impose new austerity just to reduce the public deficit to three percent of GDP, but would negotiate with France's European Union partners on a more flexible reading of Maastricht if needed.</p>
<p>The treaty itself allows a trend towards three percent to be taken into account, when the decision is taken in April/May next year on which countries qualify for a single currency.</p>
<p>De Silguy, who is responsible for monetary affairs, repeated that Maastricht treaty criteria were "reference values" but declined to say what he would consider to be an acceptable figure to show a country had reduced its deficit sufficiently near to three percent of GDP.</p>
<p>He reaffirmed that he expected the euro to be launched on time on January 1, 1999, and said he could not imagine monetary union starting up without France.</p>
<p>"All member states are determined to respect the timetable of January 1, 1999," he said. "The euro will be launched on January 1, 1999 with a significant number of member states."</p>
