<p>President Bill Clinton appeared to have won over more of the undecided voters who participated in his debate with Republican Bob Dole, with many saying they did not like the tone of the challenger's attacks.</p>
<p>A panel of 120 undecided voters from the San Diego area were on stage on Wednesday night and asked all of the questions during the 90 minute debate between Clinton and Dole, their last face-to-face exchange before the Nov. 5 election.</p>
<p>"I'm leaning more toward President Clinton," said Navy aviator Brett Balog, who had entered the debate not leaning toward either candidate. "I wasn't happy with the way Mr. Dole was prosecuting Mr. Clinton."</p>
<p>Balog said he was bothered by the way Dole "wasn't really answering the questions" but "was trying to go against Mr. Clinton." He said he came away not so much won over by the president but "by what Mr. Dole didn't say" about issues.</p>
<p>Dole, in the early and late stages of the debate, ignored a question to complain about "ethical problems in the White House" and accused the administration of "scandals almost on a daily basis."</p>
<p>Michael Breen, who said he had been leaning toward Reform Party candidate Ross Perot, said that "coming out of this I'm leaning more toward Clinton now.</p>
<p>"I think Dole had to be on the offensive and he immediately went on the offensive ... Clinton was a lot more casual. He was much more comfortable," Breen said.</p>
<p>But he said he had expected Dole to be more aggressive than he was. "I'm hoping he realises that the American public doesn't seem to like that," Breen said.</p>
<p>Susan McAfee, who opened the debate by asking the candidates what they would do to restore and improve the nation's sense of unity, said she had been leaning toward Clinton before the debate.</p>
<p>"I'm still leaning towards Clinton, but I did gain respect for Dole. Before, I was thinking I'm going to have to leave the country if Dole gets elected but now I definitely have a much more positive feel for him."</p>
<p>But McAfee also said she was troubled by the tone of Dole's rhetoric against Clinton. "It bothered me ... but we did all know it was coming," she said.</p>
<p>Berta Strategos, who asked about dealing with private sector health care issues, said she remains undecided despite listening to the candidates and meeting them afterward.</p>
<p>"I'm still divided about them," she said. "President Clinton came off very polished ... and he's a real person and Sen. Dole came across as very genuine, and a little stiffer."</p>
<p>"They didn't really say anything new that they haven't said before," Strategos said, adding her ultimate choice will be made "during the next three weeks. I'm just going to follow everything that's going on."</p>
<p>She also had trouble with Dole's personal attacks. "I think it was probably something that his campaign told him to do and he was doing it. I can't say that I think it won him any votes, and I can't say that it lost him any.</p>
<p>"But at this point in the game, I think he needs to sell himself more," she said.</p>
