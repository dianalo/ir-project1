<p>Indian cotton prices suffered a setback on Wednesday on slow mill buying and the absence of an expected announcement by the government regarding more cotton exports, dealers said.</p>
<p>In spot deals Bengal-deshi fell by 15 rupees at 895/950 rupees per maund (37.32 kg) while Punjab saw-ginned moved down by 30/50 rupees to 1,480/1,625 rupees per maund.</p>
<p>Gujarat Kalyan (medium-staple) lost earlier gains by 200/300 rupees to 12,200/12,500 rupees per candy (355.56 kg).</p>
<p>"Earlier in the week the market remained firm on speculative buying amid expectations that the government may allow more exports but delays regarding an announcement of more exports has capped a rally today," one broker said.</p>
<p>"Renewed offerings by the state-owned agencies also dragged prices down," he added.</p>
