<p>When it comes to so-called peripheral European Union currencies, they don't come much more peripheral than the Greek drachma and Portugal's escudo.</p>
<p>Just as the two countries strive to move into the heart of the EU despite their geographical positions on its fringes, their currencies are often sidelined in the markets.</p>
<p>Portugal and Greece have similar-sized economies and populations, as well as a recent history which includes a period of dictatorship that gave way in the mid-1970s to democracy. But differences shine through in market attitudes to the currencies.</p>
<p>The drachma enjoyed a buoyant 1996, as speculative flows welcomed high interest rates and the Greek government's commitment to a hard, stable currency.</p>
<p>The escudo also climbed steadily through the year, carrying that into 1997 with a three-year high on the mark this week.</p>
<p>Interest rate differentials -- key to the market's current hunger for yield -- certainly favour Greece. Three-month money there trades at around 12 percent, while equivalent Portuguese rates are almost half that, at 6.23.</p>
<p>Those rates compare with around 3.0 percent in Germany, 3.2 in France, 7.2 in Italy and 5.8 in Spain.</p>
<p>"I would be modestly bullish on the escudo but I think there's more scope with the drachma because you've got 12 percent yields, and you've got nothing like that in Portugal," said Nick Douch, economic and corporate risk adviser at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London.</p>
<p>Turnover in the escudo and drachma is roughly comparable, traders say, though flows are overshadowed by more prominent European high yielders such as the Italian lira.</p>
<p>Analysts say that is largely a function of economic size. Italian gross domestic product per capita totalled over $19,000 in 1995, around double Portugal's $9,740 and Greece's $10,715.</p>
<p>The big issue is European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), scheduled to begin in 1999. While Portugal echoes most EU states in its determination to be in the first wave of EMU, Greece is aiming lower -- at being in the second round.</p>
<p>Still, economists do not rate its chances highly.</p>
<p>"However many waves there are it'll probably be there somewhere, but there's a long way to go yet in terms of economic performance," said Douch.</p>
<p>"They've still got an awful lot of work to do...inflation is still a huge problem, the budget deficit is a big headache," said Gwyn Hacche, senior European economist at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>Despite the economic obstacles on the Greek road to EMU -- inflation ran at 8.2 percent in December -- convergence-minded investors have welcomed the political commitment.</p>
<p>"They're using the external discipline of monetary union as a means of achieving some internal controls which have been sadly lacking in the past," said Chris Tinker, chief economist at Standard Chartered.</p>
<p>Portugal's EMU aspirations are more realistic, analysts say. Though market attention focuses more on Club Med states like Italy and Spain, Portugal is better placed than they to achieve Maastricht targets, experts believe.</p>
<p>Prospects for both the escudo and drachma this year depend largely on how the monetary union process goes, analysts say. Steady EMU progress should benefit the mark's satellites as convergence plays stay in place, while a setback will jeopardise the convergence premise and should boost the mark.</p>
<p>Portugal's strenuous efforts to knock its economy into shape for monetary union may, perversely, give the escudo less scope than the drachma to appreciate, say market watchers.</p>
<p>"Portugal's already happened," said Douch at BZW. "Greece has already happened to some extent but if it is going to join EMU in the next three years and it's going to stay stable against the mark it's a better bet."</p>
