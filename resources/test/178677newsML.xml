<p>The Bundesbank, moving to play down a report it was reluctant to join a government campaign for the Euro, said on Sunday it fully supported European monetary union and was making its own efforts to inform the public.</p>
<p>A spokesman stressed that the Bundesbank was doing all it could to support the government in its efforts to achieve a stable single currency.</p>
<p>His remarks followed a newspaper report on Saturday that Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer had changed his mind and turned down a request by the Bonn government to take part in an information campaign for the planned single currency.</p>
<p>The report said Tietmeyer's refusal had raised doubts in Bonn about the Bundesbank's commitment to the Euro.</p>
<p>"The Bundesbank is doing its utmost to support the government in its drive for a stability-oriented monetary union and the President himself addresses issues of monetary union in many public appearances and articles," spokesman said.</p>
<p>"But the Bundesbank wants to conduct its own information policy similar to most other national central banks, which are not bound into the campaigns of their governments."</p>
<p>The report in the Berliner Zeitung newspaper said Tietmeyer had first agreed to back the government in an advertising campaign aimed at drumming up popular support for the Euro.</p>
<p>But Tietmeyer had recently written a letter explaining that, as the head of the powerful central bank, he could not take part in the campaign because he needed to maintain his independence, the report said.</p>
<p>Neither the chancellery nor the Bundesbank confirmed the report.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank had published brochures for people in the private sector and civil service involved in preparation for monetary union. It had also last week issued a leaflet to inform the public at large.</p>
<p>The government's series of advertisements are to be a key part of Bonn's efforts to enlighten Germans about the Euro.</p>
<p>Prominent economic experts and leaders in Germany are being asked to offer their observations on the single currency.</p>
<p>Opinion polls have consistently shown that even though politicians and industrialists favour the the Euro, most ordinary Germans are sceptical about it and want to keep their cherished D-marks.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank, which sits in Frankfurt and is largely free of government interference, enjoys widespread respect and credibility in Germany and abroad. The support from Tietmeyer was considered vital for the advertising campaign.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer was harshly criticised this week by former chancellor Helmut Schmidt for his strict interpretation of the Maastricht criteria for European currency union.</p>
<p>In an open letter in the newspaper Die Zeit, Schmidt blasted Tietmeyer's stance on EMU as counter-productive to the success of monetary union.</p>
<p>"I regard you (Tietmeyer) as the most important opponent of currency union. This is not meant as an insult, but your stance shows a lack of strategic vision," Schmidt wrote.</p>
