<p>The Swiss telecoms provider Telecom PTT said it would contest a ruling by Swiss cartel authorities that its Internet access provider "Blue Window" had temporarily received cross-subsidies.</p>
<p>"The Telecom PTT vigorously rejects the accusation that, with its online service Blue Window, it discriminated against private Internet providers and thus violated the cartel laws," the PTT said in a statement.</p>
<p>The state-owned telecoms provider, which plans a partial privatisation in 1998, denied it engaged in anti-competitive activities during Blue Window's start-up phase last year.</p>
<p>Swiss cartel authorities, in a statement on Friday, said Telecom had enjoyed an unfair advantage versus private Interet access providers during the start-up phase last September.</p>
<p>But it added that the advantage no longer existed and that no further measures were called for.</p>
<p>It also said that it remained up to the private providers whether to seek any damages in civil courts.</p>
<p>The cartel authorities said the decision was based on its investigation which followed complaints by private Internet providers about unfair practices last year.</p>
<p>The authorities said the Telecom PTT had assumed a double role as a monoply in the telecommunications sector and as an Internet provider with its service Blue Window.</p>
<p>"In the centre of the investigations was the question whether the Telecom PTT misused this double role in the sense of the cartel law," the cartel office said.</p>
<p>The Swiss PTT, according to the cartel authorities, temporarily created an unfair advantage by providing Internet access based on cheaper local telephone charges via its access number 0-842. Blue Window paid the difference between the local number and more expensive long-distance rates.</p>
<p>The cartel office ruled that competitors were improperly informed about access to the advantageous 0-842 number and the PTT at least temporarily provided cross-subsidies.</p>
