<title>USA: CME live and feeder cattle end up in light trade.</title>
<headline>CME live and feeder cattle end up in light trade.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-05-15</dateline>

<p>Light trade persisted in both CME live and feeder cattle futures as the market awaits Friday's cattle report, and prices finished higher on light short-covering, traders said.</p>
<p>Live cattle closed unchanged to 0.150 cent per lb higher with June up 0.050 at 65.500 cents. Feeder cattle ended 0.600 to 0.100 higher paced by May which again set a new contract high of 77.175 cents. August was up 0.250 at 77.400 cent.</p>
<p>Commercial hedge lifting and short-covering lifted CME live cattle futures early, but trade remained light as the market awaits Friday's USDA Cattle-on-Feed repor, they said.</p>
<p>The hedge lifting followed increased fed cattle sales Wednesday with short-covering on the discount to cash also lending support. Although cash prices were slipping, some traders considered futures at too large a discount to cash.</p>
<p>But trade was light into the close as the market moved into a holding pattern ahead of the report, they added.  </p>
<p>Analysts' estimates for May 1 on-feed numbers at the seven major feeding areas averaged 109.6 percent and ranged from 108 to 111 percent of last year. Placements averaged 113.9 percent and ranged from 104.9 to 127.5, while marketings averaged 101.0 and ranged from 98.6 to 104 percent.</p>
<p>RBH bought June late. R.J. O'Brien and RBH bought June early while Rosenthal Collins sold June and bought August. Refco and R.J. O'Brien sold August early before short-covering developed, pit sources said.</p>
<p>May feeders ran up to a new high following another gain in the latest CME feeder cattle index, traders said.</p>
<p>The latest CME feeder cattle index was up $0.13 to $76.10 per cwt, the highest level since January 26, 1995.</p>
<p>Strength in back months of live cattle also prompted scattered short-covering despite concern Wednesday over poor break-even levels. Feeders will likely take their cue from live cattle through the cattle report Friday, they added.</p>
<p>Refco notably spread long August/short October early while local short-covering and scattered commission house buying lent late support. Cargill spread long December live cattle/short August feeders, pit sources said.</p>
