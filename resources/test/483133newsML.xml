<headline>Analyst sees good benefits from Christiania merger.</headline>

<p>A merger between Norway's second largest bank, Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse ASA, and the country's biggest insurance group Storebrand ASA could lead to a rise of 15 to 25 percent in pre-tax profit by 2000 or 2001, an insurance analyst said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But the merger had left Norway's leading commercial bank Den norske Bank ASA in a strategically difficult position.</p>
<p>"The merger is very exciting in terms of benefits both on the costs and revenues side," Nils Ringdal at Dresdner Kelinwort Benson in London told Reuters.</p>
<p>"We see benefits of between 15 to 25 percent in terms of increased pre-tax profits in a few years say in 2000 or 2001."  </p>
<p>Consolidation has long been expected in Norway's overcrowded banking sector, and some analysts had proposed a joining of forces between DnB and Christiania Bank.</p>
<p>DnB took over the country's second largest life insurer Vital Forsikring in January, 1996, and entered into a bidding war on March 21 this year with Fokus Bank ASA for niche mortgage lender Bolig og Naeringsbanken (BNbank).</p>
<p>Ringdal said a merger between DnB and Christiania would have provided even greater synergy benefits.</p>
<p>"Merger benfits would probably have been higher between DnB and Christiania. It's a good solution for shareholders of Christiania, but it's probably not the best one. It's definitely good for Storebrand," he said.</p>
<p>"DnB is now in a strategic dilemma after today's announcement. I can't see how they can respond to this, they are out of options in the Norwegian market."</p>
