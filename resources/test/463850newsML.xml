<p>Blue-chip stocks powered ahead Monday, ending a four-session string of losses, as Wall Street bet that the market already had taken into account a small increase in interest rates expected at Tuesday's meeting of Federal Reserve policy-makers.</p>
<p>Based on early and unofficial data, the Dow Jones industrial average closed up 100.46 points at 6,905.25. But in the broader market, declining issues still led advances 13-11 on moderately active volume of 445 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
