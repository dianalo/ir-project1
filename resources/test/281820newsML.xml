<p>The Nigerian stock market performed beyond its own 1996 targets, a senior official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"In all areas where we set targets, we surpassed them," Rasaki Oladejo, an assistant director general at the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), told Reuters.</p>
<p>"Turnover was up by 100 percent and the new issues market increased by more than 100 percent," Oladejo said. He said the exchange also exceeded its forecast turnover of seven billion naira.  </p>
<p>"When we set the target, some people thought we were too high, but I am happy to say that we surpassed it," he said. Turnover for the whole of 1995 was about two billion naira.</p>
<p>The all-share index rose 40 percent, Oladejo said. On Tuesday, it closed at 6992.10 after opening on January 2 at 5092.</p>
<p>"Foreign investment also exceeded last year's figures by far," Oladejo added.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast it could touch $20 million compared to $1.137 million invested between July and December 1995 when the government opened the market to foreign participation.  </p>
<p>They said some foreign investors had been active lately, buying blue-chip stocks.</p>
<p>Oladejo said exact figures would be given on Thursday by the exchange's director-general Hayford Alile. He said turnover was set to increase dramatically next year after the market's computerised delivery and settlement system would have become operational.</p>
<p>Some traders said registrars were to be blamed for the current slow pace of transactions, which had been a hinderance to the growth of the stock market.</p>
<p>"The registration system is still at the crawling stage," said Olu Odejimi, the most senior trader on the exchange.</p>
<p>Analysts said because of the problem posed by registrars, certification often takes three months.</p>
<p>They said computerisation would revolutionise the market.</p>
<p>Oladejo said the system was on target to become operational in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
