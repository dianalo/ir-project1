<p>Shares of Sun Microsystems Inc. Friday surged to their fifth straight record closing high as analysts raised earnings forecasts for the network computer products supplier a day after it reported stellar results.</p>
<p>Shares of Sun, based in Mountain View, Calif., rose 75 cents to $46.31 on Nasdaq, where it the third most heavily traded issue on volume of 16.8 million shares. The stock has gained more than 70 percent from a late April low of $29.125.</p>
<p>"A solid high-end demand backdrop is fuelling Sun's growth," wrote Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. analyst Laura Conigliaro in a research note.</p>
<p>Goldman continued to recommend buying Sun's stock, saying it could reach $60, and raised its fiscal 1998 earnings estimate by 15 cents a share to $2.35.</p>
<p>However, Morgan Stanley downgraded Sun to outperform from a strong buy, taking the stock as low as $42.625 early Friday before an afternoon rebound.</p>
<p>Late Thursday, Sun said profits in the quarter ended June 30 rocketed 94 percent to $237 million from $122 million in the year-ago period, which included a one-time charge. Sales soared 26 percent to $2.54 billion from $2.02 billion.</p>
<p>Earnings per share surged to 61 cents from 31 cents, after a write-off of 12 cents a share. This was 2 cents above Wall Street's estimate of 59 cents a share.</p>
<p>Analysts noted after a conference call with Sun executives that the company is successfully branching out into new lines of computing beyond its core workstation business, and benefiting from the growth of computer networks.</p>
<p>Conigliaro said Sun's underlying growth rate now appears to have accelerated. "Fiscal 1998 is awash with new products, giving Sun ample opportunity to capitalise on its current momentum," she wrote.</p>
<p>New products in fiscal 1998 are expected to be led by new workgroup servers in the current quarter, followed by more enhancements to its Starfire high-end servers, introduced in January.</p>
<p>Sun will also add storage products. On Thursday it announced a deal to buy Encore Computer Corp.'s storage business assets for $185 million.</p>
