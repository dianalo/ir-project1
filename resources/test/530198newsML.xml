<p>United Nations economists on Monday predicted modest growth this year for key ex-communist states in eastern Europe and the Baltic region but indicated little hope for a significant upturn in Russia.</p>
<p>And while they saw Kazakhstan, the third largest state to emerge from the old Soviet Union, as achieving a turnround to just above zero growth in 1997, they said Ukraine, the second largest, seemed likely to remain in deep depression.</p>
<p>The forecasts came in the annual Survey issued by the U.N.'s Geneva-based Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), whose analysts track developments across 55 member countries ranging from the United States and Canada to Kyrgyzstan in central Asia.</p>
<p>The ECE said average performance in 1996 among the east European economies -- the non-Soviet states of the former bloc, the countries of ex-Yugoslavia and Albania -- was disappointing with overall growth dropping to four percent from 5.5 in 1995.</p>
<p>But the survey said the aggregate picture was distorted by a 10 percent gross domestic product (GDP) decline in troubled Bulgaria and masked continuing relatively strong growth among the leading reformers of central Europe.</p>
<p>For 1997, it said, countries which had done well last year -- specifically the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia which saw GDP growth of 4.4, six and 6.9 percent respectively last year -- were likely to see "a moderate slowing" in 1997.</p>
<p>On the other hand Hungary, which has gone through severe economic restructuring since early 1995 and returned only 0.5 growth in 1995, would probably see a payoff, and Slovenia, with 3.5 percent in 1996, was also likely to pick up.</p>
<p>Overall this group could reach a GDP growth of 4.5 percent, down from their average of five percent last year, with investment demand providing the driving force for domestic demand, the ECE said.</p>
<p>But the survey said that rising spending on private consumption in the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia and its impact on growing external deficits were cause for concern.</p>
<p>In Romania, with a new administration strongly committed to market reform, and Bulgaria, where elections at the weekend brought reformers to power, substantial further falls in GDP could be expected this year, it added.</p>
<p>The projected decline reflected "very strong macroeconomc adjustment and restructuring programmes" whose full dimensions were not completely clear.</p>
<p>In Russia, the ECE said, although the government expected a modest upturn after seven years of negative growth, this was widely doubted by economic analysts in the country "who on average would seem to see a standstill as an achievement".</p>
<p>Much depended on the course of policy, and especially on whether the backlog of salary payments and unpaid taxes which were at the origin of the weakness of domestic demand, could be tackled without sparking a fresh round of inflation.</p>
<p>In Ukraine, where in 1996 the GDP decline was 10 percent after 11.8 in 1995 and 22.9 percent in 1994, "the economy is still in deep depression but might bottom out in 1997," the survey said.</p>
<p>The ECE saw a much brighter picture in the three ex-Soviet Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia where, after an overall "solid pickup" of 3.4 percent last year, some growth acceleration was expected.</p>
<p>The survey also predicted a continuation of recovery in smaller ex-Soviet states in the Caucasus including Georgia, which recorded 11 per cent growth last year, and Armenia which reported a four percent rise.</p>
<p>The ECE analysts saw a similar picture in smaller central Asian states like Kyrgyzstan, which recorded six percent GDP growth last year, and Uzbekistan, which turned the corner in 1996 with two percent growth.</p>
