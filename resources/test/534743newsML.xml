<p>High-cap Azomures </p>
<p>fertiliser maker dominated the stock exchange on Thursday with</p>
<p>a special trade which sent turnover to a record high of 25.73</p>
<p>billion lei, or five times the previous level.</p>
<p>Two independent indices touched year highs for the fourth</p>
<p>consecutive session.</p>
<p>"The intention of a foreign investor to acquire a</p>
<p>significant stake in Azomures has been apparent for some time</p>
<p>and I think today they managed to do it," a broker said.</p>
<p>Thursday's "special trade" -- a large deal struck outside</p>
<p>the market and reported to the stock exchange later -- involved</p>
<p>9.525 million shares traded at a total 20.29 billion lei.</p>
<p>Bourse general manager Stere Farmache said the special</p>
<p>trade represented less than five percent of Azomures' capital</p>
<p>which would give the investor a significant position.</p>
<p>"If this investor has previously acquired more Azomures</p>
<p>packages and the stake he holds amounts to more than five</p>
<p>percent, he will have to report that to Azomures, the bourse</p>
<p>and the market regulator in two days," he said.</p>
<p>Azomures has a share capital of 209.5 billion lei.</p>
<p>Five percent is considered a dominant position as it gives</p>
<p>the stockholder increased voting rights.</p>
<p>Azomures was under considerable buying pressure after the</p>
<p>deal, announced in the market in mid-session, closing 400 lei</p>
<p>stronger at 2,500.</p>
<p>The other three first-tier stocks -- a chemical plant and</p>
<p>two pharmaceutical companies -- captured renewed investor</p>
<p>attention and their prices also rose.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected the upward trend on the first</p>
<p>tier to extend through next week.</p>
<p>Trading on the second tier was dull, with most stocks</p>
<p>edging up or staying flat. "The great Azomures excitement threw</p>
<p>small-caps into the shadow," a broker said.</p>
<p>The VAB and the BIG unofficial indices rose by 6.6 and 4.12</p>
<p>percent respectively from the previous session. The BIG</p>
<p>first-tier index jumped 5.58 percent to 2,175.37 points.</p>
