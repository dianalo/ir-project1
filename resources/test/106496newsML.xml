<p>British Telecommunications Plc said on Wednesday it was seeking a new partner, or partners, to give it the infrastructure or equity needed after German diversified utility RWE quit an alliance with BT and Viag AG.</p>
<p>"We're going alone (with Viag) for the fourth mobile licence in Germany but obviously we'll need some additional partners -- maybe on the infrastructure side or maybe on the equity side," a company spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The spokesman dismissed RWE's move to join an alliance with Germany's Veba AG and BT's main rival Cable &amp; Wireless Plc as a mere "hiccup" in its plans to compete against telecom giant Deutsche Telekom when the German market is deregulated in 1998.</p>
<p>But he declined to indentify which potential infrastructure partners -- providing access to fixed transmission capacity in Germany -- BT and Viag was in talks with.</p>
<p>BT said it was still interested in RWE's northern German fixed telecom links, adding that it was still hoping to negotiate access to its local infrastructure.</p>
<p>"If you're building a mobile network, you still need the fixed links between all the bases. RWE did have northern German fixed links and we are still carrying on talking to them," the spokesman said. But he added: "There are other infrastucture providers around."</p>
<p>BT said that relations with RWE had soured because of divergent views of the importance of mobile telecommunications in the liberalising German markets.</p>
<p>"Do you believe that mobile is the way the world is going, or do you believe it will stay fixed?...BT and Viag believe in fixed/mobile integration and RWE didn't," the spokesman said. "RWE also wanted to build much more infrastructure than BT did."</p>
<p>However, BT's plans to take its share of the lucrative German telecom market still had "things in its favour", he said.</p>
<p>Viag has access to a lot of the infrastructure in southern Germany and both companies were still hopeful of winning the country's fourth mobile licence bid.</p>
<p>BT said its German joint venture Viag Interkom, which serves about 300 large business customers, would continue to be the basis for developing a full telecom service provider in Germany.</p>
<p>In the meantime, both BT and Viag would be testing the waters for fresh partners. "We talk to each other all the time, so when things start to go a bit wonky, you just step up the old calls," the spokesman said.</p>
