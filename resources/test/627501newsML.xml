<p>Spanish Economy Secretary Cristobal Montoro said on Friday that Spanish markets were behaving well and he added that the bourse was correcting after sharp and recent gains.</p>
<p>"(Spanish) markets are not behaving badly. In this sense what happened to stocks has a lot to do with profit taking after a sharp rally," Montoro told reporters after a seminar.</p>
<p>He added that the peseta showed a limited reaction as yields, which is showing "the calm of the Spanish economy".</p>
