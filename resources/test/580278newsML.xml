<p>Istanbul shares rebounded strongly in mid-afternoon trade on Tuesday after a dissident government MP said his planned alternative coalition excluding the ruling Islamists would aim to rule rather than hold fresh elections.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100 which dived 2.3 percent to a low of 1,363 at the start of the second session, recovered to 1,389 at 1158 GMT, down 0.43 percent from Monday.  </p>
<p>"This government will not be for elections it will be a solution government," former trade and industry minister Yalim Erez told reporters after talks with a leftist leader on setting up a new coalition excluding the ruling Islamist Welfare Party.</p>
<p>Brokers said Erez's remarks reduced political uncertainty to some extent.</p>
<p>"Erez's and Yilmaz's words are signs that the talks on forming a new government will produce a result. Political uncertainty lifted a little, so players began to buy on fresh expectations," said Haydar Haydaroglu from Halkbank.</p>
<p>Erez earlier met Mesut Yilmaz, the leader of the main opposition party, who said the two agreed fully on a coalition formula that would shut out the Welfare Party of Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan after 11 troubled months in power.</p>
<p>Erez and another deputy from the junior coalition partner conservative True Path Party resigned in late April in protest at the Islamists' failure to back an army-inspired crackdown on religious activism.</p>
<p>The government has been deeply divided over the reluctance of Welfare to support reforms of the education system which it fears would erode the role of religious schools in Turkey.</p>
