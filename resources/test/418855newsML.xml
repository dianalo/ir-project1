<p>President Bill Clinton on Monday criticised Israel's decision to build new housing for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem during a meeting with Palestinian President Yasser Arafat that focused on the issue.</p>
<p>"I would have preferred the decision not to have been made because I don't think it builds confidence. I think it builds mistrust," Clinton told reporters at the start of an 80-minute Oval Office meeting with Arafat.</p>
<p>Arafat told CNN he believed Clinton would discuss the matter with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. "He said he will try, because the decision has been taken by Netanyahu himself," Arafat told CNN's "Larry King Live."</p>
<p>Arafat said he hoped Washington would play a role in halting construction of the new housing, while his top negotiator, Nabil Shaath, warned that failure to reverse the plans could spark fresh unrest and violence.</p>
<p>In his public remarks Clinton gave no indication of what, if anything, he might do to try to influence the Israelis to change their decision on the matter, which has sparked strong protests by Palestinians.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's government decided last week to build 6,500 homes for Jews on Jabal Abu Ghneim, a pine-covered hill between Jerusalem and Bethlehem known by Israelis as Har Homa.</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East War and views the entire city as its capital, but the Palestinians want East Jerusalem as capital of a future state.</p>
<p>In the CNN interview, Arafat likened Jerusalem to Rome, which is at once the capital of the Vatican and Italy. "Where there is a will, there is a way," he said.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters after the meeting the housing issue was prominent during the talks.</p>
<p>"They talked at great length ... on the Israeli decision to build Har Homa," McCurry said. "The chairman was clearly very concerned and emotional on the subject and the president certainly understood the basis for that emotion."</p>
<p>McCurry, who said Clinton and Arafat met for an hour with their advisers in the Oval Office and then for 20 minutes by themselves, avoided saying whether the United States might seek to change the Israeli stance on the matter.</p>
<p>Arafat then went to the State Department, where he and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright agreed to set up a joint commission that will meet several times a year, make sure each side is meeting its commitments and move relations forward.</p>
<p>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns likened the commission to bodies established between the United States and countries such as Russia, South Africa and Egypt.</p>
<p>Burns indicated that U.S. action over the housing would be limited to quiet diplomacy, saying Washington planned a series of discussions with the Israelis and the Palestinians in coming weeks "in order to try and re-establish ... trust."</p>
<p>Clinton, noting Israel and the Palestinians came to terms on Israel's much-delayed partial troop withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron, said at the start of the meeting this was a similarly challenging period for the peace process.</p>
<p>"Because of the efforts that he (Arafat) made in working with the Israelis, an agreement was reached ... and we're moving forward," he said. "This is also a difficult moment but I think we can work through it and go forward."</p>
<p>In January, Israel and the Palestinians reached an accord ceding 80 percent of Hebron to Palestinian rule. Six other West Bank towns had been handed over by Israel's previous government but Hebron had been a sticking point.</p>
<p>Arafat said on Monday he believed Israel wanted to build the housing to isolate East Jerusalem and appeared to suggest that Israel was seeking to extend its influence toward the town of Bethlehem, now under Palestinian self-rule.</p>
<p>Arafat, on CNN, called upon Israel to honour the language of the peace agreement, which specifically prohibits construction of any additional housing.</p>
<p>"I want the accurate and the honest implementation of what had been agreed upon, what had been signed," he said.</p>
<p>In a separate interview, Shaath, minister of International Cooperation, urged political action to halt the construction, warning violence could ensue otherwise.</p>
<p>"The only way to avert violence is to create a non-violent avenue to address this great problem which has been inflicted upon us," he said.</p>
<p>Asked if Israel was seeking with the new housing to make annexation of East Jerusalem a fait accompli, Arafat replied: "Not only for Jerusalem, but also for Bethlehem."</p>
<p>Arafat's meeting with Clinton was part of a group of U.S. visits by Middle East leaders. Netanyahu came to Washington to see Clinton last month, and Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and Jordan's King Hussein were scheduled to do so this month.</p>
