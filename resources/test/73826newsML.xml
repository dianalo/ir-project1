<headline>Bargain hunters boost Australian stocks by end.</headline>

<p>The Australian share market closed higher on Tuesday, keeping a firm grasp on gains that had looked unlikely at the start of the day. By the close, the All Ordinaries index was up 9.5 points at 2228.7.</p>
<p>Brokers said bargain hunters had buoyed the bourse after an initial selldown, driven by weaker metals prices overnight, quickly petered out and investors went looking for value.</p>
<p>"We had solid buying this afternoon," said a Sydney broker.</p>
<p>"The selling dried up early and the bargain hunters were about. The leaders have been well marked down recently."</p>
<p>Turnover at A$633 million was solid rather than spectacular, with investors anticipating greater activity after the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>"I would expect more action tomorrow after the FOMC meets tonight. Some are holding back (until then)," the broker said.</p>
<p>Oil and gas major Santos saw its shares jump to a six year high after announcing a new oil and gas find in Queenland, its second in the Cooper/Eromanga Basin in the past week.</p>
<p>Beverages group CC-Amatil, transport and logistics group Brambles and telecommunications, transport and healthcare group Mayne Nickless found support as investors targetted growth stocks after a flat few days for the industrial sector.</p>
<p>Falls just shaded rises, while about 36 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
