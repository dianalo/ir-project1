<p>Exhibitions organiser Blenheim Group Plc said on Friday that discussions with an unnamed party about a possible takeover of the group had been terminated.</p>
<p>"Blenheim has not received proposals which its Board believes should be recommended to shareholders," the company said in a statement.  </p>
<p>On August 1 Blenheim confirmed that it was in talks that could lead to an offer for the company.</p>
<p>At that time, Anglo-Dutch media publisher Reed-Elsevier had been cited in press reports as a potential bidder but Reed has declined to comment that it was holding takeover talks with Blenheim.</p>
<p>Blenheim, which reports first-half results on October 2, also said that its performance during the first six months of the year had been "very strong".</p>
