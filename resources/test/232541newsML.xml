<title>USA: New-home sales drop cross-country in October.</title>
<headline>New-home sales drop cross-country in October.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-12-03</dateline>

<p>Sales of new homes dropped across the country in October, the Commerce Department said Tuesday, falling at the sharpest rate in seven months.</p>
<p>Sales fell 8.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 714,000 after a revised 4.5 percent decline in September. October's sales pace was the slowest since last March, when new homes were bought at a rate of 713,000 a year, and was much weaker than the 772,000-unit rate forecast by Wall Street economists.</p>
<p>The October sales drop was the biggest monthly decline since March, when they fell 9.1 percent. Previously, the department said September sales had eased 0.5 percent to 816,000 a year, but it revised that to show a much steeper drop.</p>
<p>New-home sales were strong for much of the first half of this year, sustained by the ready availability of credit and good employment prospects that have boosted incomes.</p>
<p>But last week, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing, or used, homes also had fallen for a fifth straight month in October.</p>
<p>For new homes, the biggest regional drop during October occurred in the Northeast, where sales plummeted 32.3 percent to a rate of 67,000 a year -- the biggest monthly drop in nearly 3-1/2 years, since a 33.6 percent plunge in May 1993.</p>
<p>Sales in the Midwest fell 11.3 percent to an annual rate of 110,000 --  the lowest rate since 108,000 in February 1995 -- while in the West they were down 8.9 percent to 195,000 a year. October sales in the South, the nation's largest regional market, eased 0.6 percent to a rate of 342,000 a year during October.</p>
<p>Despite two consecutive months of declines, October sales of new homes remained 6.1 percent above the year-ago level of 673,000 a year.</p>
<p>Weakening housing markets support the idea of a slower-growing economy after a strong first half of 1996. National economic output expanded at only a 2 percent annual rate in the third quarter and most economists foresee relatively tame growth in the final quarter as well.</p>
<p>Slower sales of new and existing homes may reassure skittish financial markets concerned about potential pressures on interest rates if the economy does not slow down as expected.</p>
<p>In fact, long-term interest rates already are declining.</p>
<p>Last week, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said fixed-rate home mortgage rates fell for the sixth week in a row to hit a nine-month low.</p>
<p>Thirty-year fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.52 percent in the week ending Nov. 29, down from 7.53 percent the previous week. The rate has not been lower since the week ended March 8, when the average was 7.38 percent.</p>
<p>The average sales price for a new home fell in October to $165,300 from $168,400 in September.</p>
