<title>BELGIUM: EU investigating 14-16 cartels.</title>

<text>
<p>The European Commission said on Tuesday that it was investigating between 14 and 16 alleged cartels and that some of the companies involved could be fined.</p>
<p>European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said the absence of high-profile decisions in 1996 did not mean the Commission was easing off, only that it needed time to investigate fully increasingly complex cases.</p>
<p>Speaking to a European Parliament committee, he cited an ongoing investigation into allegations of a newsprint cartel, where the documents gathered during Commission raids were mainly in Swedish.</p>
<p>Van Miert also noted, while presenting a report on European Union competition policy in 1996, that the Commission had to be particularly cautious in its assessments of cartels. Commission decisions to fine companies for rigging prices or markets have been systematically challenged in court.</p>
