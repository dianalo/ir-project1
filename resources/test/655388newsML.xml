<p>Nasdaq said it has delisted WebSecure Inc from the Nasdaq SmallCap Market.</p>
<p>The exchange said the company restated first quarter revenues after an investigation questioned the validity of certain licenses and contracts that were initiated and orchestrated by Emanuel Pinez, the founder and former chief executive of Centennial Technologies Inc.</p>
<p>Centennial Technologies was delisted from the NYSE in March after it was accused of allegedly issuing materially false and misleading financial statements overstating its financial condition. Pinez has since been arrested and charged with insider trading.</p>
<p>Nasdaq said that continued listing of WebSecure is "inconsistent" with the best interest of the investing public.</p>
