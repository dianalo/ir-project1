Deve Gowda was learnt to have requested former prime minister Chandra Shekhar's help to sort out the imbroglio in Uttar Pradesh, even before the motion to recall the state governor was taken up for discussion.

<p>TATA RAYTHEON VENTURE IN DOUBT</p>
<p>Problems for the Tata Raytheon Bangalore airport project appear to be mounting as the government rejected the proposal to shut the Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) airport. Closure of the HAL airport, which was agreed upon, was viewed as a crucial step towards making the proposed Tata consortium airport a profitable one since it guaranteed a complete load of traffic in and out of Bangalore to the new airport. With this rejection, the earlier commitment made to transfer all international and domestic flights to the new airport was also killed.</p>

<p>Financial Express</p>
<p>THREE BANKS CUT DEPOSIT RATES</p>
<p>Three state-owned banks slashed their short-term deposit rates by one to two percentage points. The move was aimed at discouraging major interbank call lenders from parking their funds in short-term bank deposits. Private and foreign-owned banks, on their part, were turning down such depositors. The depositors, mainly insurance companies and financial institutions, were seeking better yields through the short-term deposit route, because of the low interbank call rates.</p>
