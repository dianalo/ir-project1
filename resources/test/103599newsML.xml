<p>The European Commission said on Tuesday it had cleared the creation of a joint venture between British Gas Trading Plc and Group 4 Utility Services Ltd to supply meter reading services in Britain.</p>
<p>It said in a statement that the venture called AccRead would initially be the only supplier of such service which was formerly carried out by British Gas staff.</p>
<p>But it is confident "competition will emerge as other utility suppliers commence similar activities", the statement said.</p>
<p>The joint venture follows the privatisation of British Gas and anticipates the separation in 1997 of its transportation, and storage activities and its trading services, the statement said.</p>
<p>The Commission also noted that it was the intention of the British authorities that a competitive market for meter-reading services should be created in the gas industry as well as for other privatised utilities.</p>
<p>Group 4 Utility Services Ltd is a subsidiary of Group 4 Securitas NV, a supplier of security services based in the Dutch Antilles.</p>
