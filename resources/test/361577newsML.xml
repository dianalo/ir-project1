<p>France, stressing the importance of NATO unity, said on Thursday no decision had been taken on its idea for a five-power summit with Russia to discuss future European security arrangements.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department has virtually ruled out the idea, which is backed by Germany, saying it had not received any such proposal and did not expect one would be forthcoming.</p>
<p>French Foreign Ministry spokesman Yves Doutriaux recalled that NATO had mandated its Secretary-General Javier Solana to negotiate a charter enshrining relations with Russia so that the enlargement of the Alliance did not create "new fractures in Europe".</p>
<p>The aim was to begin the process of admitting former communist Central European countries at a NATO summit in Madrid in July harmoniously within a new European security architecture, he said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Consultations are continuing among the allies and with Russia to facilitate the conclusion of these negotiations, but no decision has been taken on the idea of a (five-power) summit as reported by news agencies," Doutriaux said.</p>
<p>"France attaches the highest importance to (allied) unity in this process," he said.</p>
<p>Diplomats said on Wednesday that President Jacques Chirac, encouraged by talks with Russian President Boris Yeltsin, had floated the idea of a Big Five summit in Paris in April to overcome Moscow's hostility to NATO enlargement.</p>
<p>They said German Chancellor Helmut Kohl supported the idea and Britain was cautiously favourable, but whether the meeting took place would depend on the United States and on the reaction of smaller NATO allies who could resent exclusion.</p>
