<p>News Corp Ltd has a tentative agreement to join PrimeStar Partners, a satellite-dish TV service owned by a group of cable operators, the Wall Street Journal said.</p>
<p>In Tuesday's electronic edition, the Journal cited sources close to the matter as saying News Corp would contribute the satellites it controls with MCI Communications Corp in return for a minority, non-voting stake in PrimeStar.</p>
<p>To cut the deal, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp was able to overcome objections from Time Warner Inc, which was heavily lobbied by PrimeStar's other partners. It comes shortly after News Corp's plan to acquire EchoStar Communications Corp collapsed.</p>
<p>However, the Journal said it was not certain a final agreement would ever be reached between News Corp and PrimeStar. Among the terms still to be resolved were how a new venture would be financed, as well as how to phase in new 18-inch dishes to customers now using PrimeStar's 36-inch dish.</p>
<p>The tentative pact may be announced as early as this week, the Journal said.</p>
