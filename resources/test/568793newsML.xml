<headline>TRADERS ANGRY OVER STOCK MARKET DELAYS.</headline>

<p>Stock market traders were angry on Thursday as technical problems delayed trade for 30 minutes in some banks and almost an hour for others.</p>
<p>The Tallinn stock exchange said that it was investigating the problem and a report on whether the source of the problem is the exchange's or outside its control is expected after a technical department meeting this afternoon.</p>
<p>"We are definitely angry," one trader said. "This not a once a month problem but things that reappear," he added.</p>
<p>Within the last two weeks several major banks were completly cut off from dealing during morning trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>"This morning was very difficult with clients wanting to place urgent orders and a local news agency sending incorrect profit figures for one bank and no connection to the exchange," another trader added.</p>
