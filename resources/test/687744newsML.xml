<p>State-owned National Power Corp (Napocor) said on Wednesday it had failed to sell unused uranium worth $32 million.</p>
<p>Richard Lazatin, head of Napocor's bidding committee, said two bidders showed up, Siemens Power Corp and Nukem GmBh, but the bids were lower than the indicative price of $32 million.</p>
<p>Nukem offered $16 million for the uranium while Siemens Power, a unit of Siemens AG, submitted a $25.16 million bid.</p>
<p>The uranium was supposed to be used by Napocor for the 620-megawatt nuclear power plant that was built in the 1980s but has never operated because of structural defects.</p>
<p>Prior to the bidding, eight firms had expressed interests to buy the fuel, Lazatin said.</p>
<p>He said Napocor had a month to decide whether to relaunch the bidding process or negotiate with the highest bidder.</p>
