<p>Colombia beat Venezuela 2-0 away on Sunday to extend their lead at the top of the South American World Cup qualifying group and hand their hapless neighbours their sixth defeat in seven games.</p>
<p>Central defender Jorge Bermudez headed the unbeaten Colombians into the lead after seven minutes and striker Ivan Valenciano scored the second five minutes into the second half.</p>
<p>Colombia were once again inspired by veteran captain Carlos Valderrama, who at the age of 35 seems to be playing better than ever.</p>
<p>They also made light of the absence of injured striker Faustino Asprilla, scorer of six goals in the World Cup qualifiers.</p>
<p>Venezuela coach Eduardo Borrero, who was making his debut, included several newcomers and his team were far from disgraced, creating as many chances as Colombia but ultimately paying for poor defending. The result left them firmly rooted to the bottom of the group with only one point.</p>
<p>Colombia, who have won five and drawn two games, extended their lead to six points after second-placed Paraguay drew 0-0 away to Bolivia and third-placed Ecuador did not play.</p>
<p>The top four of the nine teams qualify for the 1998 World Cup in France.</p>
<p>Teams:</p>
<p>Colombia - 1-Farid Mondragon, 13-Wilmer Cabrera, 5-Jorge Bermudez, 15-Osman Lopez, 4-Antonio Moreno, 6-Mauricio Serna, 8- Harold Lozano, 19-Freddy Rincon, 10-Carlos Valderrama, 7-Anthony De Avila, 20-Ivan Valenciano.</p>
<p>Venezuela - 1-Rafael Dudamel, 2-Luis Filosa, 4-Edson Tortolero, 3-William Gonzlez, 6-Elvis Martinez, 5-Sergio Hernandez, 8-Felix Hernandez, 10-Andrew Perez, 7-Luis Ramos, 9- Giovanni Savarese, 11-Rafael Castelin.</p>
