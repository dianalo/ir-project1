<p>Merrill Lynch initiated coverage of Hungarian chemicals company BorsodChem Rt with a "neutral" recommendation saying the stock was approaching full valuation.</p>
<p>"We consider there is limited upside in the intermediate term when it is viewed against its international peer group and when declining momentum of the Hungarian market is considered," Tom Chadwick, Vice President of Merrill Lynch in London said.</p>
<p>"Our earnings forecasts point to 15 percent per annum real earnings growth in the next two years as the benefits of capacity additions and improving margins are felt, however, we believe these are reflected in the current valuation," he said in a company research, dated June 13.</p>
<p>BorsodChem produces PVC and MDI (methylene diphenyl diisocyanate), materials widely used in the construction and manufacturing sectors.</p>
<p>On Monday BorsodChem shares ended at 7,045 forints, down five.</p>
