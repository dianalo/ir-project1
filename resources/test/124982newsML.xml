<p>Italy said it had convened a "strategic committee" for the introduction of the Euro in a sign of its determination to "take part from the start" in Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>A Treasury statement said the committee would sit for the first time on Friday (1000 GMT) and that Prime Minister Romano Prodi and Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi would attend the inaugural session, which will be open to the media.  </p>
<p>"The convening of the committee, which will deal with all aspects of the introduction of monetary union, is testimony to Italy's determination to participate from the start in the process of the European Union's integration," a statement said.</p>
<p>It said the 30-member committee would be chaired by Treasury Ministry undersecretary Roberto Pinza.</p>
<p>Prodi's centre-left government has drawn up a 62.5 trillion lire budget for 1997, including measures for a special one-off "Euro tax", to try to ensure Italy meets the strict deficit conditions for joining the Euro from its 1999 start.</p>
<p>A senior Bundesbank official, Hans-Juergen Koebnick, said on Wednesday that Italy and Spain were not likely to be among founder nations of the currency union but they should be ready to join those entering before 2002.</p>
<p>Koebnick, a Bundesbank council member, and other senior German central bank officials have also cautioned against so-called economic "window-dressing" by European Union member states to try to make the grade.</p>
