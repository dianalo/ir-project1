<p>NWE gas oil was a touch weaker on Thursday on the back of easier futures. Premiums were essentially unchanged, although diesel which remains the focus of most attention, was looking a touch pressured, traders said.</p>
<p>May IPE gas oil was trading 75 cents down at $162 at 1115 GMT. Activity was modest and premiums were a touch easier, 25-50 cents or so on diesel, traders said.</p>
<p>Barges were heard offered at May IPE +$10 fob out of Rotterdam while in Antwerp offers were down at +$9.25 fob.</p>
<p>"I think +$10 will probably be possible this afternoon (on Rotterdam material)", said one barge broker.</p>
<p>EN590 cargo premiums were also very narrowly easier with bids of May IPE +$11.25 cif close to offers of May IPE +$12 cif. A first half May cargo was understood sold on Wednesday at May IPE +$11.25 cif.</p>
<p>FOD and DIN were steady and still in line with each other. Buying interest for both was around May IPE +$4.50 cif NWE with offers about $1 higher.</p>
<p>Heating oil barges were slow, but stable. Traders said May IPE +75 cents for Rotterdam second half was done in a very quiet market.</p>
