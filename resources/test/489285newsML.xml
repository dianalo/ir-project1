<p>The Philippines' hosting of North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop will enhance peace and stability in the east Asian region, Philippine President Fidel Ramos said on Saturday.</p>
<p>"By doing this, we enhance not only the chances of reconciliation of the two Koreas but also enhance the peace and security of the Asia Pacific region," Ramos said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Ramos said the Philippines would not only earn goodwill from South Korea by hosting the defector but also from China, caught in a diplomatic dilemma after Hwang, the highest-ranking ideologue in North Korea, walked into the South Korean consulate in Beijing last February and sought asylum.</p>
<p>China was unable to send Hwang directly to Seoul without incurring the ire of its long-time ally, Pyongyang.</p>
<p>In early March, the Philippines offered to be the transit point between Beijing and Seoul for Hwang.</p>
<p>"I understand from the diplomatic feedback that...(it) is also seen favourably by China," Ramos said.</p>
<p>The Philippines and China have been locked in a diplomatic impasse over mutual claims to a group of islets and reefs in the South China Sea.</p>
<p>Hwang, who slipped into the Philippines last month, has not been seen by reporters. He is reported to be staying in the country until the middle of the month.</p>
<p>Ramos was speaking in Cebu, where a meeting of finance ministers from the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum was taking place.</p>
