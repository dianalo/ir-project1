<p>A slew of Japanese energy data covering 1996 shows that deregulation has started to change the shape of the country's oil trade, oil industry sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Refinery output fell for the first time in nine years in 1996, while imports of key products like kerosene and gas oil jumped sharply -- prompting a fall in crude imports.</p>
<p>Japan's 1996 crude oil imports totalled 263.5 million kilolitres (kl), down 1.3 percent from 1995, data Tuesday from Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said.  </p>
<p>"The fall in crude oil imports can be partly attributed to a rise in imports of oil products such as kerosene and gas oil," Takashi Kawai, analyst with Nikko Research Centre said.</p>
<p>"Some refiners also required less crude because they kept runs low in order to keep stockpiles tight and cut costs."</p>
<p>Japan last April removed restrictions on oil product imports, allowing companies other than oil refiners to import.</p>
<p>Refiners, now exposed to competition from imported products, have been striving to cut costs.  </p>
<p>"With South Korea's oil product export capacity growing, Japan is expected to come under increasing pressure from imports this year and in 1998," Kawai said.</p>
<p>Japanese kerosene imports last year rose 130.9 percent to 4.4 million kl, while gas oil imports grew 40.6 percent to 1.9 million kl, according to MITI.</p>
<p>But 1996 output of oil products fell 0.9 percent to 225.4 million kl from a year earlier, the first drop in nine years, MITI said.</p>
<p>Another reason behind the fall in crude imports was weaker demand from electricity utilities, sources said.  </p>
<p>"Crude demand from electricity utilities fell sharply last year because the summer was cooler compared to 1995, when temperatures soared," an oil industry official said.</p>
<p>In addition to lower temperatures denting appetite, electricity utilities are trying to cut down usage of crude and C-type fuel oil, which they use for direct burning.</p>
<p>Japan's largest electricity utility, Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) said last April, that it planned to slash its crude oil and fuel oil C purchases by one third in fiscal 1996/97, ending March 31, to 6.5 million kl.  </p>
<p>Instead, TEPCO said it planned to boost operations of cheaper nuclear and liquefied natural gas (LNG) power generators.</p>
<p>"The drop in regional crude imports shows utilities burned less crude," the oil industry official said.</p>
<p>Crudes from South East Asian countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Vietnam are suited for direct burning because of their low-sulphur content.</p>
<p>MITI statistics show 1996 crude imports from Southeast Asia fell by 22 percent from the previous year to 30.6 million kl.  </p>
<p>In contrast, imports from Nigeria grew a sharp 28.5 percent to 1.2 million kl as West African crude became more price competitive with regional and Middle East grades.</p>
<p>"Spot market premiums of Middle Eastern crudes were high last year and supplies of regional crudes tight, making West African crudes economic," an oil company official said.</p>
<p>"It is unlikely West Africa will become a major supplier to Japan because of geographical distance," said an analyst who declined to named. "However, supplies will flow into Japan when the economics work."  </p>
<p>In the long term, exports of South East Asian crudes would fall as reserves shrink and domestic demand grows, leading to greater dependency on other regions, including the Middle East.</p>
<p>MITI statistics show crude imports from the Middle East in 1996 totalled 211 million kl, up 0.4 percent from a year earlier, and accounted for 80 percent of total imports.</p>
