<title>NEW ZEALAND: Kiwifruit NZ to appeal court decision on sourcing.</title>
<headline>Kiwifruit NZ to appeal court decision on sourcing.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1997-05-22</dateline>

<p>Kiwifruit New Zealand said on Thursday it would appeal a High Court decision preventing it from marketing overseas-harvested fruit in foreign markets.</p>
<p>Kiwifruit NZ is the operating name of the Kiwifruit Marketing Board (NZKMB).</p>
<p>The case was brought to the High Court in Auckland by a group of concerned kiwifruit growers.</p>
<p>The court was asked to determine whether the NZKMB had the power to market -- outside New Zealand and Australia -- fruit other than that grown in New Zealand. It ruled it could not.  </p>
<p>Kiwifruit NZ chairman John Palmer in a statement the appeal would be based on legal concerns rather than the specific outcome of the decision.</p>
<p>"Our legal advice is that the decision gives a narrow interpretation of our powers, which could potentially restrict the sensible operation of our business," he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the board has pledged to the court that it has no plans to buy overseas kiwifruit for resale overseas and would not do so without consulting growers.  </p>
<p>Kiwifruit NZ communications manager Susan Robinson-Derus said the NZKMB was not even at the stage of determining which countries it might want to buy fruit from.</p>
<p>"This isn't something we're doing now, or contemplating doing in the next year or so. It is literally a concept that we want to be able to investigate."</p>
<p>Robinson-Derus said KNZ's present infrastructure earned revenue for only seven months of the year. The NZKMB wanted to explore the strategy of buying overseas kiwifruit as a means of enhancing grower returns and creating long-term value.</p>
