<p>Material Sciences Corp, which reported record sales and earnings Thursday, said it expects higher results in fiscal 1998.</p>
<p>"Investments in sales marketing, research and development and capital equipment should provide the basis for expanded sales and earnings in fiscal 1998," said G. Robert Evans, chairman and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>The company posted third quarter sales of $69.7 million, up from $58 million one year ago. Net income rose to $4.9 million, compared with $333,000 one year ago, when Material Sciences took a $2.6-million restructuring charge. At the time, the company reorganized into four business units.</p>
<p>Evans said corporate restructuring and higher returns on its investments helped third quarter sales and net income reach record levels.</p>
<p>Material Sciences manufactures specialty coated materials.</p>
<p>The company's stock was up 1/4 Thursday at 17-1/2.</p>
