<p>Swiss shares posted a sixth consecutive fall on Friday to close nearly 1.5 percent lower on the back of weaker opening U.S. markets, a sagging dollar and derivatives-related selling.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Swiss correction was reinforced by falling Standard &amp; Poor's futures. "This got our derivatives machinery going," one trader said.</p>
<p>High-profile stocks took the brunt of the losses.</p>
<p>One dealer said the downward move may now have bottomed out, but others warned the slide may not be over yet.</p>
<p>The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) down 81.0 points or 1.45 percent to 5,498.5.</p>
<p>The broad Swiss Performance Index (SPI) fell 48.87 points or 1.36 percent to 3,547.03 points.</p>
<p>Bourse volume was at 3.29 billion Swiss francs.</p>
<p>The expiry of August contracts on Swiss Options and Financial Futures Exchange (Soffex) was described as smooth.</p>
<p>Views on further developments were mixed.</p>
<p>"There are opportunities now for bargain hunting," one dealer said.</p>
<p>However, one technical analyst recently argued that the slide may continue to intra-day lows of 5,370 SMI points before the market could rebound to a range between 5,500 and 6,000 points.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical Roche, which said first-half net profit rose 10 percent to 2,428 million francs, had a see-saw session with a high of 13,650 and a low of 13,020. The certificates ended down 65 francs at 13,325.</p>
<p>Dealers said some investors who had hoped for higher profit growth sold the stock.</p>
<p>Novartis registereds, which led the actives list, ended off 42 rancs at 2,177.</p>
<p>CS Group and Winterthur recouped some of the losses incurred since they announced merger plans. CS Group was down 0.25 francs to 186. Winterthur up eight to 1,380.</p>
<p>UBS was down 38 francs to 1,517.</p>
