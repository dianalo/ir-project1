<p>Britain's third largest insurance company Sun Life &amp; Provincial Holdings Plc said on Monday new business figures for the first half of 1997 had increased over the same period in 1996.</p>
<p>Total single premiums increased by 10 percent to 697.5 million stg, from 633.5 million stg. But new regular premiums were down at 77.0 million stg from 81.0 million stg, the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Measured on the industry index of new regular premiums plus one tenth of single premiums, total new business was up two percent at 146.8 million stg, from 144.4 million stg.  </p>
<p>"I am pleased with our new business in a very competitive market. Our innovative group personal pension plan has been very well received by IFAs (Independent Financial Advisers) and we are optimistic of a continuation of the strong trend of recent months," Sun Life's managing director Les Owen said in a statement.</p>
<p>Owen said he was particularly encouraged by sales trends in the last two months, with single premium pensions up 31 percent and single premium bond sales up by 16 percent during May and June.  </p>
<p>Sun Life said sales of pensions single premiums were up nine percent at 390.7 million stg from 357.4 million stg in the first half of 1996, with a strong performance from flexible annuities.</p>
<p>And single life premiums were up 21 percent at 246.4 million stg, from 203.2 million. This was helped by volume sales of Sun Life International (Isle of Man) products through British IFAs, it said.</p>
<p>Sun Life said the underlying trend in new regular premiums was encouraging. Excluding small self-administered schemes (SSAS), they were up 10 percent at 66.5 million stg, it added.</p>
<p>New life regular premiums were up 18 percent at 21.3 million stg from 18.0 million stg.</p>
<p>This rise had been helped by strong sales of Sun Life's new flexible mortgage repayment product and by a substantial increase in protection and savings business through Sun Life Direct Marketing.</p>
<p>The group said group money purchase, particularly group personal pensions, had performed "exceptionally well" after the January launch of a new product. New regular premiums were up 46 percent at 20.4 million stg, it added.</p>
