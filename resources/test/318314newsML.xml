<p>Zimbabwe's annual inflation rose to 16.4 percent in December from a seven-year low of 13.9 percent in November, in line with forecasts by many local economic analysts.</p>
<p>Although a recent spate of price increases, including the cost of fuel, are expected to feed January's inflation figure, many analysts still expect annual inflation to stay in a 16-18 percent range in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>The December rate from the state Central Statistical Office (CSO) left the average monthly inflation rate for 1996 at 21.7 percent compared with 22.5 percent the previous year.</p>
<p>It was also below the 20 percent forecast for the year-end in the country's 1996/97 budget.</p>
<p>Savvas Kyriakides, managing director of economic and share market analysts Dataworld, said the monthly inflation rate would be kept in check by low food prices.</p>
<p>Food accounts for 29.2 percent of Zimbabwe's inflation basket, the largest single weighting.</p>
<p>"We are expecting a bumper harvest...and that should balance off other areas," Kyriakides told Reuters.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe's farm-based economy is expected to grow by seven percent this year, up from an estimated five percent in 1996, on the back of a good agricultural season.</p>
<p>John Robertson, one of the country's leading economic consultants, also said the December figure was widely expected, but maintaining it in a 16-18 percent range would depend on how President Robert Mugabe's government managed to control spending and money supply growth.</p>
<p>"There is still a lot of work to be done in this area," he said.</p>
<p>Last November, Zimbabwe's central Reserve Bank raised to 20 percent from 17.5 percent the statutory reserves banks are required to keep with it.</p>
<p>The central bank said the measure was aimed at tightening money supply growth -- which has remained stubbornly above a target of 22 percent per year fixed under economic reforms started in 1991.</p>
<p>That growth, many local analysts say, threatens efforts to keep inflation down. Wage increases later in the year may also fuel inflation. ---Harare Newsroom: +263-4 72 52 27/8/9.---</p>
