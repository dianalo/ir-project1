<p>Millers and animal feed producers turned buyers for old-crop wheat this week as continued rain delayed the start of the harvest in some parts of France, raising fears the quality of the new crop could be hit, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Spot wheat into Rouen was quoted on Thursday at 800-810 francs per tonne, depending on silos and quality, unchanged from Monday.</p>
<p>Old-crop wheat for September-December was a nominal 857.50 francs per tonne but dealers said there was no trade as sellers stayed put.</p>
<p>Grain experts say the crop potential was still intact but high moisture level have raised fears of unwanted germination in the fields and lower protein content, a key measurement for the quality of bread-making wheat.</p>
<p>"People worry over the quality of the new crop so this prompts some small demand for the old crop," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Millers mostly want to secure good quality wheat while animal feed producers simply need supplies to bridge the gap between the two campaigns, in anticipation that the grain will come in late.</p>
<p>Buyers had expected an early harvest because warm temperatures in the spring helped boost up crop development. But rain since mid-June has pushed back the start of the harvest in regions where the grain had reached maturity.</p>
<p>Near the La Pallice port in the southwest combining was due to start in early July but would probably be delayed by eight to 10 days, brokers said.</p>
<p>In the Paris basin area the harvest might also be pushed back by 10 days to end July, they said.</p>
<p>Dry conditions are set to return over the weekend but temperatures should remain below the seasonal average, Meteo France forecasters say.</p>
