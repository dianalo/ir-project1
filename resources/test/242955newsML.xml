<headline>LME tin, lead sink to new lows, copper unfazed.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Lead and tin carved out fresh lows in thin LME trading on Monday but copper held above support despiet another expected increase in stocks, traders said.</p>
<p>Lead hit the lowest level in 13 months and tin sank to a 1-1/2 year nadir, continuing weakness seen on Friday. The movements were exaggerated by the lacklustre volume, traders added.</p>
<p>Tin gave up all its recent gains in the morning and then continued to spiral lower in the afternoon, hitting $5,810, the lowest since May 19, 1995. It ended the day at $5,840, a loss of $180 from Friday.</p>
<p>One analyst said Chinese and Malaysian selling was at least partly behind the slide that began on Friday, as the two nations sought to take advantage of domestic export quotas before the year end.</p>
<p>Next support may be seen at $5,730 and $5,610, important lows from May 1995, analysts said.</p>
<p>Lead, weighed down by growing stock levels and technical weakness, fell to $668 in the morning and edged $2 lower in the afternoon, the softest price since November 7, 1995, when the metal hit $665.</p>
<p>The market ended the afternoon kerb at $666.50 per tonne, a loss of $13.50 from Friday.</p>
<p>Analysts said trendline support was pegged at $666, with further support at $634, the low of October 18, 1995.</p>
<p>Copper held above Friday's lows, pegged as nearby support around $2,120, as it moved sideways in muted trading.</p>
<p>Prices made a half-hearted attempt to regain the $2,150 level, but slid back to end the kerb $5 lower at $2,133.</p>
<p>"Copper seemed fairly resilient and the back held up quite well," said one floor trader, referring to the cash/threes backwardation which ended at $155/65, a touch firmer than Friday.</p>
<p>Floor traders said they expected a small rise in stocks on Tuesday, about 2,000 to 3,000 tonnes after a build of 6,400 tonnes on Friday.</p>
<p>"We believe about 20,000 tonnes will be added in the next several weeks, with some coming into Long Beach," a trader said.</p>
<p>Alumimium tested the lower end of its recent range, finishing the kerb at its intra-day low of $1,509, down $17. Nearby support had been pegged at $1,510-12, with the next key level at the psychological $1,500 area.</p>
<p>Nickel finished the day down $40 at $6,820 and zinc lost $6 to $1,042.</p>
<p>Alloy was last indicated at $1,354/55 compared to $1,360 on Friday.</p>
