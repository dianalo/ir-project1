<p>June BTP futures traded on LIFFE will follow the U.S. lead higher on Wednesday and tackle resistance at 127.50 to clear the upward path to 128.00, chartists and analysts said.</p>
<p>"There is no autonomous domestic movement at the moment and BTPs will go higher tracking the other markets," said Alfredo Granata, analyst at Banca di Roma in Rome. "The lira's stablitly against the mark supports the BTP market but I don't see any particular push up on the future today. First resistance will be at 127.50.</p>
<p>At 0818 GMT, June BTPs were at 127.34, up 32 basis points.  </p>
<p>Granata said above 127.50, there was further resistance around 128.00. "But it will be quite hard for BTPs to reach that level today," he said.</p>
<p>Daily charts show 128.00 was the high on April 11.</p>
<p>Norman Beauchamp, head of derivatives at Cooperative Bank in London, said the market was still looking for a potential rate cut from the Bank of Italy and BTPs would stay relatively well bid for the short term, but might not outperform other markets.</p>
<p>"Daily RSI and stochastics are both beginning to turn back up and are in oversold territory," he said. "We could have a move back towards the 128 area in the near future."  </p>
<p>To the downside, Granata said the first support was at 127.00.</p>
<p>"If that is broken we could see a stronger retracement towards 126.35," he said. "That has been a strong support area in the last few days when we have seen some retracement in the market."</p>
<p>Beauchamp saw support at 126.80 from Monday's high with key trendline support below that at 126.13.</p>
<p>At the short end June Eurolira futures were at unchanged on the day at 93.15.</p>
