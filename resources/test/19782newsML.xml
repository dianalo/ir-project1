<p>Trading company Hagemeyer NV was expected to show a first-half increase in net profits per share of 16 to 21 percent to a range of 2.70 to 2.85 guilders from 2.33 in the same period of 1995, analysts said.</p>
<p>Total net profits were estimated by analysts to rise by around 57 percent to 111 million guilders in the first six months of 1996 when the company reports on Thursday.</p>
<p>The acquisition of Borsumij-Wehry last year boosted turnover and profits in the first half compared to the same period in 1995. Analysts said the expected increase of net per share was a better indicator of the firm's growth than straight net profit.</p>
<p>"I foresee a growth of 16 percent for the whole year," analyst Robert-Jan Stassen of Bangert Pontier said.</p>
<p>Hagemeyer's Asian joint venture with Cosa Liebermann is likely to show a rapid increase, analysts said.</p>
<p>They noted the consumer products sector was still under pressure and margins were being squized.</p>
<p>"Sales in the consumer products sector (including TVs) might have risen somewhat as result of the Olympics and the European football competition, but it does not look like margins have recovered," Joost Buchner of Van Lanschot bankiers said.</p>
<p>"I do not expect a big contribution from consumer electronics," he said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the North American food business of Hagemeyer was increasing. "They are a niche player in speciality foods in the U.S.", said Buchner, adding the margins in this sector were high.</p>
<p>"The second half of 1996 might show even better figures on the food sector," Buchner said, as the festive season brings in "I expect more small acquisitions in the U.S.," said Bangert analyst Stassen. "The Hagemeyer stategy is to buy more companies in North America," he said, adding the firm was also on the look out for acquisitions in Hungary and other countries in Eastern Europe and in Scandinavia.</p>
<p>Analysts said they expected Hagemeyer to sell its textile unit in the short-term.</p>
<p>In the beginning of 1996 the firm said it was planning to sell the textile division this year.</p>
<p>The textile division was acquired last year when Hagemeyer baought Borsumij-Wehry.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's First Pacific Co has a controlling stake in Hagemeyer.</p>
