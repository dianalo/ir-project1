<p>A big question hangs over the peace deal Russian security chief Alexander Lebed signed with Chechnya's rebels at the weekend. What to do with the region's Moscow-backed leader Doku Zavgayev?</p>
<p>The mention of Zavgayev brought a scowl to Lebed's face just minutes after he had triumphantly declared that the war, which has dragged on for more than 20 months, was now over.</p>
<p>A Russian reporter wanted to know whether the deal he had just signed effectively annulled the powers of the man recognised by Moscow as Chechnya's legitimate head.</p>
<p>"What does anulling Zavgayev's power mean?" he growled.</p>
<p>"Did he have any?"</p>
<p>Lebed, a former paratroop general who likes to talk tough and thinks he can cut through the hypocrisy which has grown up around Moscow's bloody and fruitless conflict, clearly hopes that will be that.</p>
<p>As far as Lebed is concerned, Zavgayev has not been sidelined by the political settlement he signed with the rebels on Saturday because he was never really in power.</p>
<p>Chechnya's last communist boss, Zavgayev owes his return to power in the region to the thousands of Russian troops sent there to crush the separatists who forced him out in 1991.</p>
<p>Those troops are now due to leave under Lebed's peace deal, and Zavgayev is outraged.</p>
<p>All last week he was in Moscow, making his point in a string of interviews. Accusing Lebed of aiding in a coup in Chechnya, he said the deal amounted to giving power to criminals.</p>
<p>As a former official in the Kremlin administration, he claims to have Boris Yeltsin's ear, although Yeltsin, whose virtual disappearance from public life has raised doubts about his health, has barely spoken to his own envoy Lebed.</p>
<p>Certainly Russia's Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who is due to chair a meeting of top officials to review the deal on Monday in Yeltsin's absence, appears to be worried about Zavgayev's position.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin's spokesman said he was concerned by signs that the rebels were setting up parallel power structures across the region, saying that their actions violated earlier agreements.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said Chechnya's pro-Moscow government might resign on Sunday to make way for the coalition Lebed has said will have to be set up in the wake of the deal, which postpones the issue of Chechen independence for five years.</p>
<p>But Zavgayev himself, elected in December 1995 in a vote hailed by Moscow but condemned by independent observers as widely falsified, shows few signs of fading away.</p>
<p>He presents a problem for Moscow because, having been elected in a vote officials said was free and fair, it cannot simply sack him.</p>
<p>Moscow Ekho radio quoted Zavgayev as saying that he had thought about resigning -- as Lebed has suggested -- but that he was driven by a sense of duty to stay on.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin may decide to take Lebed's advice and encourage Zavgayev to step down to smooth things over with the rebels, who see Zavgayev as a traitor and a Moscow puppet.</p>
<p>But apart from the humiliation that would involve for Moscow, Zavgayev and some independent commentators have warned that handing over power to the rebels would lead to civil war.</p>
<p>Zavgayev says thousands of people in traditionally anti-separatist areas of the region are ready to take up arms against the separatists.</p>
<p>There have so far been few signs of them. Indeed, Interfax quoted a Russian interior ministry troop commander, Partagen Andrievsky, as saying on Sunday that the pro-Moscow local administrators and many police had either joined the rebels or simply disappeared.</p>
<p>Zavgayev has lost the respect of many Chechens with his distinctly ambivalent attitude to the Russian bombardment of civilian targets. In July, he denied there had been any attacks on villages, provoking disgust from refugees who had been forced to flee bombing.</p>
<p>But Viktor Kremenyuk, deputy head of the USA and Canada Institute, said Moscow may decide that Zavgayev had a point.</p>
<p>"Regardless of my lack of love for Zavgayev, he has raised a justified question -- how can you have peace among all groups in Chechnya if you seal a deal with just one group?"</p>
<p>Zavgayev could end up being the spanner in the works of Lebed's plan. "Yeltsin might decide to insist that Zavgayev be taken into account in any peace deal," he said.</p>
