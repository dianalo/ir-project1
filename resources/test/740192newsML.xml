<p>The Dutch parliament is to examine the possible risks to health and safety posed by the oil industry's blending of waste refinery products to make ship fuel, the ministry of environment said on Friday.</p>
<p>The enquiry follows the publication of a report  by the ministry and the regional environmental agency in the Rotterdam area, where most of the Netherlands' refineries are based.</p>
<p>"The current working practice in the bunker world,...results in risks to people, the environment and the motors of ships that cannot be assessed ," the report says.</p>
<p>It concludes that the blending process produces a wide variation in bunker (ship fuel) products, although this did not necessarily mean they were dangerous.</p>
<p>"Because of the increasing practice of blending and varieties of blended products, it appears that the majority of samples... differ from the composition of benchmark bunker oil," the report said.</p>
<p>It called for regulation to ensure that bunker fuel produced by blending conforms to tighter standards, but acknowledged that the complex and competitive nature of the market did not lend itself to outside control.</p>
<p>"A degree of self-regulation in this market is unavoidable," the report said.</p>
<p>Bunker suppliers in Rotterdam responded on Friday, saying blended products produced by the major oil companies were already in accordance with international standards and that further regulation was not required.</p>
<p>"They are looking at it from a clinical rather than a realistic angle... If you fill your car up with petrol you are exposed to materials that are not good for man. You shouldn't drink the stuff, but you have to handle it. Why should things be different for ships," one said.</p>
