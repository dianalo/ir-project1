<p>The wife of a senior Greek policeman on the island of Crete was seriously injured on Tuesday when a bomb blew up her car in what police said was probably a local crime hit.</p>
<p>The wife of the police chief of the main city of Iraklio, Costas Soldatos, was in hospital in serious condition, police on Crete said.</p>
<p>"The bomb exploded as soon as she turned on the engine," a policeman said.</p>
<p>Police said similar attacks on Crete in the past had been attributed to local crime rings.</p>
