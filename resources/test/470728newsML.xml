<p>He was Papua New Guinea's great political survivor, but Sir Julius Chan ended up savaged because of the "dogs of war" hired to earn him his place in history.</p>
<p>Chan, 57, stepped down on Wednesday after a 10-day political crisis sparked by his decision to hire 70 African mercenaries to crush a dirty little war on the island of Bougainville and reclaim a once-lucrative copper mine.</p>
<p>Lined up against him during were the army, politicians of all political pursuations and many ordinary people angered not just by the mercenary fiasco but by the poverty, corruption and high unemployment that blights the South Pacific country.</p>
<p>As late as Tuesday, it appeared that the urbane Chan, the strongman of Papua New Guinea's turbulent politics, had managed to weather the storm after he survived a parliamentary motion of censure against him.</p>
<p>His performance in parliament was classic Chan: he remained aloof from a rowdy debate, shuffling papers, studiously cleaning his spectacles and only once taking the floor to defend the mercenary contract on the grounds of national security.</p>
<p>But armed soldiers and protesters who blockaded parliament house after Tuesday's victory helped turn the tide and on Wednesday an emotional Chan stood up before his colleagues in parliament and ceded to the inevitable.</p>
<p>"Sometimes you have to choose and I have chosen to defuse the situation to hopefully allow due process of the law to take its normal course," Chan said.</p>
<p>"For those who think I run away I do not run away."</p>
<p>At a packed news conference an hour later, Chan appeared relaxed and confident, smiling and joking with journalists.</p>
<p>He said he accepted responsibility for the crisis but was unrepentant for taking tough decisions he said were vital to the future prosperity of his country.</p>
<p>"Today it is Julius Chan who must take account of some of the pains and trouble ... that has taken place in the past week and that responsibility is mine and mine alone," he said.</p>
<p>"I have looked cold-blooded at times because a developing country has sometimes got to take some very tough decisions."</p>
<p>With typical pragmatism, he added: "Power is not absolute. Peace is very essential if we are to enjoy the freedom and rights in our constitution."</p>
<p>In two terms as prime minister, Chan helped shape his country's transition from an Australian territory to a nation boasting some of the world's major resource projects.</p>
<p>Prime minister first from 1980 to 1982, Chan has held many senior portfolios in his 24 years in Papua New Guinea's parliament both before and after independence in 1975.</p>
<p>He has been known as a reformer.</p>
<p>After the 1992 general election, Chan, who became finance minister, outlined his "Robin Hood" strategy to tap the nation's booming resources industry to create jobs in agriculture.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of the country's 4.3 million people live in rural areas and only 14 percent are in formal employment outside subsistence farming.</p>
<p>Since then, Chan has steered Papua New Guinea toward greater control of its resource projects, pushed ahead with a major privatisation programme and refined plans for a stock exchange.</p>
<p>Relations with Australia have been difficult -- Chan has criticised Australia for making its annual A$320 million ($250 million) aid payments tied to specific projects.</p>
<p>He was angered as well by Australia's refusal to give Chan's government the kind of military hardware, especially helicopter gunships, needed to quash the nine-year Bougainville rebellion.</p>
<p>Hence the contract with Sandline -- which promised to supply all the assault helicopters the army needed on the island.</p>
<p>Chan has a wife and four children. He was educated in Australia where he earned a degree in agricultural sciences.</p>
<p>After returning home, he joined the Australian Administration that then ran Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>After a brief stint in a shipping business, Chan was elected to parliament in 1968. From 1972 to 1977, he was finance minister and held governorships of the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and Asian Development Bank.</p>
<p>In July, 1977, he contested the first post-independence election as leader of the People's Progress Party (PPP) and was elected deputy prime minister.</p>
<p>But three months later he withdrew his party from the government after a dispute with then prime minister Sir Michael Somare, regarded as the father of modern Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>In 1980, Chan was made a knight commander of the civil division by Britain's Queen Elizabeth for his work in administering his country.</p>
<p>In March that year Chan toppled Somare in a no-confidence vote and became prime minister, a position he held until he was defeated by Somare in a general election in 1982.</p>
<p>He was reelected prime minister in August 1994 on a dual platform -- ensuring national security and ending economic mismanagement.</p>
