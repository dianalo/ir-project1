<p>Slovenia's new tax on trading profits, scheduled to be introduced next year, may put a damper on investment and further reduce foreign participation on the country's fledgling bourse, exchange officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The influence of this new tax on the volume of trading on our market will not be too positive," Lidija Gabrijelcic, the Ljubljana stock exchange's spokeswoman, told Reuters. "Any new tax restrains investments."</p>
<p>The tax, which has to be paid by individual investors, is expected to amount to an average of about 30 percent of all securities trading profits. Similar taxes already have to be paid by companies and brokerages.</p>
<p>However, some analysts said the negative influences of the measure may be limited because of the relatively small number of individual investors who put their money into shares.</p>
<p>"I do not think the influence of the new tax will be so fatal for the market because there aren't many indivdual investors. Most of them are trading through brokerages," said Aleksander Simon, an analyst at Nova Ljubljanska Banka.</p>
<p>According to unofficial estimates, small investors account for about 20 percent of activity on the Ljubljana bourse, which was established in 1989 as one of the first stock markets in the former East bloc.</p>
<p>Foreign investors, put off by outdated and complicated legislation, account for a mere 3.5 percent of turnover. Every transaction in stocks by non-Slovenes has to be registed with the country's central bank, the Bank of Slovenia.</p>
<p>A new law on cross-border financial transactions aimed at easing foreign participation has been in preparation for two years, but has not even been presented to parliament yet.</p>
<p>"The introduction of that law would certainly increase foreign investment," Gabrijelcic said.</p>
<p>Political uncertainty after Slovenia's general election three weeks ago may further delay the introduction of that eagerly-awaited law, analysts said.</p>
<p>The centre-left Liberal Democrats of current Prime Minister Janez Drnovsek emerged as the strongest party with 25 out of 90 parliamentary seats. But a loose alliance of rightist parties, calling itself the "Spring coalition", received 45 seats and is pushing for its own candidate to be the next prime minister. -- Novica Mihajlovic, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
