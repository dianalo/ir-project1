<p>Five players were tied for the lead after the second round of the New South Wales Challenge on Friday as former British Open champion Ian Baker-Finch was disqualified for signing an incorrect score card.</p>
<p>Australians Peter Lonard, David Ecob, Chris Gray and Robert Stephens and New Zealand's Steve Alker were all on seven-under-par 137 after an eventful second round at the Terrey Hills course.</p>
<p>They were one stroke clear of defending champion Peter Senior and fellow-Australian Lucas Parsons.</p>
<p>Ecob began the day four shots behind overnight leader Gray but reached six-under after picking up four shots in three holes on his outward nine. He went on to card a five-under 67 while Gray shot a steady 71.</p>
<p>Australian Masters champion Lonard hit a 69 and Stephens a 68 while Alker, twice a winner on the Australasian PGA Tour this season, had a 70.</p>
<p>Baker-Finch's miserable run of recent form hit a new low when he disqualified himself after realising he had signed an incorrect card after Thursday's opening round.</p>
<p>The Australian, who has made only one halfway cut in a tournament in over two years, inadvertently signed for a first round of 78 when he had actually scored 79.</p>
<p>"I was careless leaving the scorers' hut because I was a bit disappointed at shooting seven-over-par and didn't check my card carefully enough," Baker-Finch told a news conference.</p>
<p>Australia's Peter Fowler was also disqualified after missing his tee-off time while compatriot Martyn Roberts withdrew before his second round through injury.</p>
<p>The unlucky Roberts was struck on the wrist by a ball driven by an amateur playing partner during Wednesday's pro-am event.</p>
<p>Senior, who needs to win the tournament to guarantee a place in the British Open at Royal Troon in July, shot a 70.</p>
