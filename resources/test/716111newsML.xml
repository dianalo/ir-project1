<p>A strong earthquake in eastern Venezuela Wednesday has not affected operations in state-owned oil giant Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) and both production and exports continue to flow smoothly, PDVSA spokesmen said.</p>
<p>PDVSA's 197,000 barrels per day refinery at Puerto la Cruz in the east of the country "has absolutely not been affected, there's been no problems," PDVSA affiliate Corpoven spokesman Domingo Marsicobetre told Reuters.</p>
<p>Electricity briefly failed at the Jusepin oil field that lies among the rich cluster of working fields south of Puerto La Cruz, briefly stopping pumps.</p>
<p>"But the electricity came back on about ten minutes after the quake," PDVSA affiliate Lagoven spokesman Ruben Briceno told Reuters. "Production has essentially not been hurt."</p>
<p>The earthquake, which struck at 1523 local/1923 GMT and registered 5.5 on the Richter scale at its epicenter, according to Venezuelan measurements, left at least four dead and 20 wounded in eastern state Sucre's capital Cumana, according to state governor Ramon Martinez.</p>
<p>The quake shook most of Venezuela's central and eastern coastal region, but only rattled office buildings in Caracas.</p>
