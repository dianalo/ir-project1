<p>The following is a summary of findings from recent opinion polls about European economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>GERMANY, March 13 - Three-quarters of German voters think Europe's planned single currency should be delayed if member countries do not meet the Maastricht criteria, a new survey said on Thursday. A mere 14 percent argued for softening the tough line backed by the Bundesbank and Finance Minister Theo Waigel in order to allow the launch to take place on schedule in 1999, the Forsa survey in the weekly Die Woche said.</p>
<p>Die Woche also published two bank surveys showing widespread scepticism among business executives about the monetary union. Only 22 percent were positive about it and only 14 percent expected it to start on time.</p>
<p>BRITAIN, March 10 - Almost two-thirds of UK fund managers said EMU would significantly change their investment plans, but almost an equal number expect the start date for the single currency to be postponed, a monthly Gallup poll of fund managers showed. A majority of continental European fund managers, meantime, believe EMU will take place on time and only a third said it would change their investment plans.</p>
<p>BONN, March 6  - More than half of German voters want the strict economic criteria to qualify for Europe's planned single currency to be softened and only one-fifth think they should be applied strictly, according to a survey by the respected Allensbach Institute.</p>
<p>The poll also said 47.6 percent of the sample group opposed the euro, while 41.6 percent said they supported it. Only 10.8 percent were undecided. On the criteria, 55.2 percent said they should be softened, while 19.6 percent wanted to see them applied as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty, according to the poll.</p>
<p>AUSTRIA, March 5 - Nearly 50 percent of Austrians believe conversion to a European single currency, scheduled for 1999, will make their savings less valuable, a survey by market research institute Spectra showed. Nearly 40 percent expected the euro to be a disadvantage for Austria. Only 15 percent thought it would bring benefits.</p>
<p>FINLAND, March 3 - A Reuters poll found 22 of 23 dealers, analysts and economists surveyed at banks and corporate treasury departments believed Finland would be in the first group of countries to join stage three of EMU, if it started on time in 1999.</p>
<p>BRITAIN, Feb 27 - The UK retail banking sector is significantly behind its continental European competitors in preparations for introduction of the euro, Coopers &amp; Lybrand said in a survey. The survey found continental Europeans did not see UK banks as a threat "largely because they do not believe that the UK will join the EMU at its outset."</p>
<p>NETHERLANDS, Feb 26 - Over half of Dutch voters want a referendum on currency union, a NRC Handelsblad survey showed. One in three thought the Netherlands would be worse off under EMU in 20 years time, while only 12 percent saw benefits. Another 29 percent said EMU membership would make no difference.</p>
<p>BRITAIN, Feb 25 - British voters would prefer to wait and see on EMU rather than plunge in at the start of a single currency in 1999, a Reuters/NOP opinion poll showed. The survey of 1,049 people found 41 percent wanted Britain to see how the proposed single currency worked before deciding whether to join. Some 30 percent thought the country should stay out altogether.</p>
<p>FINLAND, Feb 25 - Finns would be more inclined to take a favourable view of EMU participation if most European Union member countries joined the single currency. In all, 42 percent of 2,409 respondents said Finland should join if most other EU members did, while 25 percent were against, the Centre for Finnish Business and Policy Studies (EVA) said in a report.</p>
<p>GERMANY, Feb 24 - Seventy-seven percent of Germans want EMU to be postponed from its 1999 start date, a poll for Spiegel magazine by polling firm Emnid showed. The survey found only 18 percent of respondents favoured introducing the single currency on time.</p>
<p>SWEDEN, Feb 21 - A large majority in all Sweden's political parties would vote against joining the European Union (EU) if a referendum were held now, according to a new poll published on Friday.</p>
<p>The poll by the Research Group for Social and Information Studies (FSI) showed only 21 percent of members of the ruling Social Democrats party would vote in favour of joining the EU now compared to 45 percent in the 1994 referendum. Support for EU membership among the conservative opposition party, the Moderates, has fallen to 52 percent from 87 percent.</p>
<p>FINLAND, Feb 17 - Four in five members of the Finnish parliament declined to state their opinion on whether Finland should join EMU, a pro-EU lobby said. All 200 MPs were asked to respond in writing to questions relating to EMU. Of the minority who gave their opinion on Finnish membership of EMU, 66 percent were largely in favour although many attached conditions to their support.</p>
