<p>UK's Deputy Prime Minister and transport head John Prescott could turn to London's financial community to raise up to two billion stg through a special bond issue to fund repairs to London Transport, the Times said on Monday.</p>
<p>The newspaper quoted a spokeman for the Department of Transport as saying, "The Government is looking at all options."</p>
<p>One alternative is that investment banks in London could issue bonds. Another is that London Transport could operate a trust through which public and private funding is channelled, the paper said. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 7717</p>
