<p>Indian gold prices firmed up towards close on Monday on thin supplies, recouping early losses, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said demand was poor and volumes low on Monday. Prices of gold biscuits (116.50 gms) ended Rs 100 higher at Rs 58,700 per piece.</p>
<p>Stray industrial buying trimmed early losses in silver which opened lower on arrivals of about 500/700 Kg of imports, dealers said. Silver was up by Rs 50 per Kg during last week.</p>
<p>Sentiment was subdued at close and traders said they expected the market to be range-bound in the immediate future.</p>
