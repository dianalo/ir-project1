<p>Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc said Monday it knew of no reason for the sharp drop in its share price, which follows the long-awaited approval last week of its Viracept AIDS drug.</p>
<p>Agouron shares were down 5-1/2 to 75.</p>
<p>"We haven't a clue what's going on with the stock. It's ridiculous," said Agouron spokeswoman Donna Nichols. "The market is not being very kind to us at the moment."</p>
<p>Nichols said that the early sales and distribution of Viracept were proceeding smoothly.</p>
<p>Analysts speculated that the stock was hit by profit taking after a run-up ahead of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval and noted that it was a generally down day for the biotech sector.</p>
<p>Other losers in the group included Biogen Inc, down 2-1/16 to 39-15/16; Centocor Inc, down 1-7/8 to 30-1/8; and Genzyme Corp, off 1-1/4 to 23-3/8.</p>
