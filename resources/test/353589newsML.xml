<p>Swaziland's sugar industry, the country's largest foreign exchange earner, was brought to a standstill on Tuesday by a two-day-old national strike called by unions to speed political reform in the landlocked kingdom.</p>
<p>Swaziland Sugar Association President Brian Glassock told Reuters the industry stood to lose three million rand ($664,000) a day in the strike action which, although limited in the industrial sector, had hit the sugar belt hard.</p>
<p>"We are losing money because this is a critical time for irrigating sugar cane so that its growth is not interrupted before it is cut in April," Glassock said.</p>
<p>Sugar crops were almost entirely irrigated and preliminary crop estimates of 490,000 tonnes could be affected if the strike -- by some three-quarters of the sugar industry's workers -- ran into weeks, he said.</p>
<p>Swaziland's sugar exports are estimated at around $140 million a year, or 33 percent of the nation's foreign exchange earnings.</p>
<p>The Swaziland Chamber of Commerce said industries were operating at around 90 percent of normal production as their workers belonged to unions not affiliated to the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) which had called the strike.</p>
<p>"In comparison to last year where the whole country was affected, this is a non-event and the strike has mainly been isolated to the sugar and timber belts," chamber executive director Harvey Bird told Reuters.</p>
<p>Mondi Timber Products told Reuters their Piggs Peak operations had ground to a halt.</p>
<p>"There is no production and the factories are just standing (still)," said Mondi's marketing manager Zane Oberholzer. He declined to give details on the cost of wasted production.</p>
<p>SFTU official Barbara Dlamini told Reuters the strike would continue indefinitely to press for greater political activity.</p>
<p>Swazi political parties are severely restricted under a 1973 decree which vested all state powers in the monarchy. After a violent strike early in 1996, reigning King Mswati III set up a commission to review a constitutional framework and make recommendations for change.</p>
<p>Dlamini said pro-democracy campaigners did not want to oust King Mswati, adding: "We want democratic change with the king as constitutional monarch".</p>
<p>Four Swazi trade unionists were arrested at the weekend and held on charges under the Public Order Act, prompting protests from neighbouring South Africa's largest union federation.</p>
<p>South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo met his Swazi counterpart in Pretoria on Tuesday to clear tensions arising from the threatened slowdown in the handling of goods from Swaziland by the Congress of South African Trade Unions.</p>
<p>He told Swazi Foreign Minister Arthur Khoza that the union federation's stance did not represent government policy and assured him the government would not interfere in Swazi internal policy, Pretoria's foreign affairs ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>Another round of talks will be held in Swaziland but no date has been set yet. Swaziland is heavily dependent economically on South Africa, which absorbs more than half of the kingdom's exports.</p>
