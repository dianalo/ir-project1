<p>Girls in Kinshasa, once one of Africa's liveliest capitals with a nightlife to match, say they are wrapping up in public in response to harassment by Laurent Kabila's soldiers for wearing mini-skirts or tight trousers.</p>
<p>"We all carry a wraparound skirt to wear to and from the clubs. We are very frightened," Alice, a part-time prostitute outside one of the city's seedier night spots, told Reuters.</p>
<p>It is not only prostitutes who have readjusted their dress sense. A young translator waiting for a taxi at 10 p.m. was threatened last week by three soldiers.</p>
<p>"They said it was not Congolese to wear trousers. They told me I would be killed if I did not take them off. When I did they burnt them on the side of the road and left me half-naked," she told Reuters.</p>
<p>Kabila's government, which renamed Africa's third largest country the Democratic Republic of Congo after marching into the capital on May 17, says there is no ban.</p>
<p>"It is a small problem resulting from the excess of zeal on the part of some soldiers," governent spokesman Raphael Ghenda told journalists. "In a period of change there are many intitiatives which are taken precipitately."</p>
<p>But Kabila's deputy, Deogratias Bugera, has called for what he called "a clean-up of public morals".</p>
<p>Residents say that shortly after the rebel takeover, local language announcers on national radio spoke out against mini- skirts and tight trousers.</p>
<p>A French-language announcer at the end of last week said he was happy to note that the city's women were now wearing "more suitable attire".</p>
<p>Many of Kabila's troops, some of whom were recruited during his seven-month march across the country, have never been to a city the size of Kinshasa before.</p>
