<p>Indium featured in the industrial minor metals over the past week as consumers tried to cover their commitments in a market suffering from a lack of available metal.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, cobalt remained under downside pressure, while vanadium firmed.</p>
<p>The minor metal market, in line with other commodity markets, failed to react significantly to the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>"We had a phone call from our Beijing office saying business as normal," one trader said.</p>
<p>China is a major player in all metals and other commodities.</p>
<p>Traders said indium drove higher as Chinese producers refused to sell into a market which has recently seen brisk Japanese based buying.</p>
<p>"They (the Chinese) have withdrawn from the market after the New Year holiday and are not showing signs of being sellers," one trader commented.</p>
<p>Traders said the Chinese producers were oversold and were not keen to sell spot material. They said China may not return in any force until March/April.</p>
<p>Tightness was not eased by Western producers who were also oversold or fully committed to Japanese contracts.</p>
<p>"There seems to be no material on the ground," a trader said. Peru was locked into long term contracts and had little readily available material, while Russia was offering small amounts of material at high prices.</p>
<p>Several traders suggested the market had the potential to rally over the coming weeks. They said levels of $300 per kilo or above was achievable.</p>
<p>Cobalt slipped back, despite the continuing warfare in Zaire. There was further talk of Russian offers.</p>
<p>Traders said they will closely eye the Defence National Stockpile which will open its negotiated bid for cobalt on February 20.</p>
<p>In the vanadium market prices US demand lifted prices. Traders said stocks were thin on the ground.</p>
<p>Mercury held steady but traders noted some Russian offers creeping into the market.</p>
<p>Recently,  trade sources said that Russia may be prepared to release some material from strategic metal stockpiles.</p>
<p>They said that 420 tonnes of cobalt, 30,000 76 lbs flasks of mercury, 7,000 tonnes of titanium sponge and an undisclosed amount of chrome could be released.</p>
<p>Gallium was also underpinned by low stock levels from CIS producers. Japanese demand was also noted in gallium.</p>
<p>Magnesium was showing signs of easing on the back of over production.</p>
<p>Antimony under light Chinese selling drifted lower.</p>
<p>One trader said that Chinese stock had recently arrived at Rotterdam and that there was more on the way.</p>
<p>"There is selling in the market, though it is not aggressive," one trader said.</p>
<p>He believed the market had the potential to fall by around another $100.</p>
