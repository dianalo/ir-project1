<p>Nigeria will privatise its state enterprises at its own pace despite pressure from home and abroad to move more quickly, finance minister Anthony Ani said on Monday.</p>
<p>"We have not said we are not going to privatise, what we are saying is that a committee will look into the issue more carefully," Anthony Ani told a news conference following his detailed breakdown of the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>Military ruler General Sani Abacha, in a nationwide radio and television broadcast on Saturday, said government needed more consultations before embarking on privatisation of state companies.</p>
<p>Disappointment spread through much of Nigeria's financial community, which had expected a commitment to rapid privatisation of companies in sectors such as oil production, refining, telecommunications and power generation.</p>
<p>The World Bank and local business leaders had been pressing for privatisation, saying it would bring in badly needed funds to stimulate economic growth.</p>
<p>Oil-rich Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, has been in recession since 1993 when the country slid into crisis over annulment of an election that would have restored democracy.</p>
<p>"We do not want to rush into privatisation and it is not a matter of not having the political will...no one anywhere can tell us what we should do," said Ani.</p>
<p>The government has also been criticised for keeping a dual exchange rate system which allows it to buy foreign exchange at a rate of 22 naira to the dollar instead of the market rate of 80 naira to the dollar.</p>
<p>"We will look at the social impact of a merger (of the exchange rates) and allow the government time to look into all the ramifications of the issue," Ani said.</p>
<p>He said the government would target growth at 5.5 percent in 1997, up from 3.25 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Measures proposed for stimulating growth include putting money into agriculture and food production, family economic development and exploitation of minerals other than crude oil.</p>
<p>Abacha's tight fiscal and monetary policies through 1995 and 1996 have not stimulated growth, but have brought annual inflation from above 80 percent to below 30 percent.</p>
<p>Ani said tight monetary policy would continue through 1997, with the aim of bringing inflation as low as 15 percent.</p>
