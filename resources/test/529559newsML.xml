<headline>German DTB to extend futures,options trading hours.</headline>

<text>
<p>The Deutsche Terminboerse (DTB) derivatives exchange said on Tuesday it planned to extend trading hours for all its debt futures and option contracts as of August 1.</p>
<p>The DTB said the move would mean that trading on the DTB would end simultaneuosly with that on LIFFE, the London International Financial Futures and Options exchange, but added business on DTB would continue to start earlier than on LIFFE.</p>
<p>The close of DTB trade will be put back to 1700 GMT from 1530 currently, the exchange said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The move would open the DTB up for more business from the United States, where time differentials mean participants can only get involved in trade in the European afternoon, the German exchange said.</p>
<p>The DTB also said it planned to introduce spread products for trading between futures contracts on debt of different maturities.</p>
<p>Products for Bund/Bobl futures spreads, Bobl/government bill future spreads, Bund/government bill future spreads and spread trades between three- and one-month euromark futures would be available, it said.</p>
<p>"Up until now, each part of such trades had to be executed separately, presenting the risk of price movement in the intervening time period," the DTB said.</p>
<p>"That risk will be eliminated with the new products and spread trading will become easier."</p>
