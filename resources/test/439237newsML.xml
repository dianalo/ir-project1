<p>Venezuelan telephone company CANTV will get a rate hike on April 14, the Ministry of Transport and Communications said.</p>
<p>After a meeting between the Ministry, CANTV president Gustavo Roosen and Venezuelan Investment Fund president (FIV) Alberto Poletto, "new tariffs have been approved that will come into effect April 14," releases from both the FIV and the Communications Minsitry said.  </p>
<p>The releases did not say how much the increase would be for, but the FIV said "given that the tariff increase will be concentrated on basic rent, the percentage change on (telephone) bills will not be large." CANTV has said it was due a 4.18 percent increase.</p>
<p>Both the FIV and Ministry releases said the increase had been agreed with the understanding that talks on revising the mechanism for calculating tariff increases would continue.</p>
<p>Under the current system, CANTV rates are adjusted according to lagged changes in the wholesale price index.  </p>
<p>The original 1991 contract between CANTV and the government allowed for revisions in the rate setting system in the third, sixth and eighth years of the concession.</p>
<p>"I want to insist that this shows the national government's readiness to comply correctly with all its promises," Transport and Communications Minister Moises Orozco Graterol said.</p>
<p>News of the rate increase came after nearly two weeks of investor concern that saw CANTV share prices slide as much as 20 percent after the government said the company would not get the hike.  </p>
<p>Poletto, for his part, said the agreement showed "promises undertaken by the government in privatization contracts ... will be respected with all force ... as was the case with CANTV and will be with the forthcoming CVG sales contracts".</p>
<p>Venezuela is due to privatize iron and aluminum firms currently managed by state-holding company Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) in the second half of the year.</p>
