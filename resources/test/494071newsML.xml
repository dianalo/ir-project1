<headline>OPTIONS - Steady US debt vols reflect slow week.</headline>

<p>Implied volatilities for U.S. debt futures were mostly steady Tuesday, a reflection of the light economic calendar this week, analysts said.</p>
<p>"Basically they're low because we don't have anything coming out this week" until Friday, said one floor broker in Treasuries. March retail sales and producer price data will be reported Friday.</p>
<p>June bond volatility was estimated at 8.65 percent late in the session, down slightly from 8.70 at Monday's close.  </p>
<p>May volatility edged higher, to 8.50 percent from 7.85 Monday, as futures tested their session lows late in the day. Analysts cautioned, however, that values for May are increasingly erratic and difficult to interpret because the options expire in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>One of the largest transactions in debt options this session was a purchase of 10,000 May 109 bond calls at premiums of 6/64 and 7/64. Traders surmised the sizable purchase, roughly equivalent to buying 1,500 futures contracts, could mean the investor is looking for a rally in the short term.  </p>
<p>With volatility so low, buying the calls probably seemed like a reasonable bet despite accelerating time decay as the options approach expiration April 18, a trader said.</p>
<p>The trader predicted volatilities could slip a little further, but not much, given the retail and inflation data on the horizon.</p>
<p>Eurodollar volatilities also remained low, with June unchanged from Monday at 7.00 percent, September steady at 10.20, December down 0.2 at 11.80, March steady at 13.30, June 1998 down 0.3 at 14.00 and September 1998 down 0.2 at 15.30.  </p>
<p>Short-dated June mid-curves were at 15.00 percent, unchanged, and short-dated September at 15.50, up 0.2.</p>
<p>A dealer firm bought 5,000-by-10,000 September 94.00/94.25 call spreads, following a similar purchase Monday. Traders said the strategy may reflect the view that the Federal Reserve is done tightening credit for now, and futures are poised for a limited rally with low volatility.</p>
