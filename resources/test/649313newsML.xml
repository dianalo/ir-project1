<p>The long-term survival of the rhinoceros could be at risk due to insufficient and dwindling funds for conservation programmes, a leading conservationist group warned on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Urging international donors to provide long-term assistance to countries with rhinos, the British-based TRAFFIC (Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce) said a continuing lack of funds could lead to a resumption of trade in rhinoceros horn.</p>
<p>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) banned all commercial trade in rhinoceros parts in 1977 to try to save the animal from extinction at the hands of poachers who hunted it for its horn, highly prized for Middle East dagger handles and in Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>"Without funding support from donor nations, the burden of costs associated with rhinoceros conservation must be borne by the range states unilaterally and many simply do not have the... resources," TRAFFIC said in a report to a CITES meeting which opened in Harare on Monday.</p>
<p>Rhino-range states include South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia, and Kenya -- which together hold about 80 percent of the world's remaining 12,000 rhinos -- as well as India, Nepal, Myanmar and Vietnam.</p>
<p>TRAFFIC said although recovery plans were in place in all the African and Asian range states it had surveyed for the report -- apart from  Myanmar and Vietnam -- most of these countries were facing severe funding crises.</p>
<p>In Asia for example, it said, only an estimated 30 percent of $32 million needed annually for the programmes was available.</p>
<p>High levels of expenditure in India and Nepal had exceeded $1,500 per square kilometre a year, TRAFFIC said, noting that very few of the range states could afford to spend that much money on rhinoceros conservation.</p>
<p>"The implications (of the shortage of funding) are that the longterm survival of the rhino could be at risk," TRAFFIC information officer Bobbie Jo Kelso told Reuters.</p>
<p>"If the range-countries are not able to have enough money for rhino conservation, they are going to be looking at alternatives. These are valuable natural resources and they could open up trade, this is one of the implications," she said.</p>
<p>"South Africa is trying to move the (CITES) parties towards that," she added. South Africa, highly commended by TRAFFIC and several top animal rights groups for its conservation of black and white rhinos, is proposing that the Harare CITES meeting allow it to trade in white rhinoceros parts.</p>
<p>TRAFFIC is urging the meeting to reject the proposal, saying it is premature because there are inadequate controls to monitor trade.</p>
