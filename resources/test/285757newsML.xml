<p>Marxist guerrillas holding 74 hostages in the Japanese ambassador's residence in Peru are waging a propaganda war on the World Wide Web.</p>
<p>Like many other radical or revolutionary groups in the developing world, the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) has found allies in cyberspace.</p>
<p>On a Web page created one day after MRTA guerrillas stormed a diplomatic reception on December 17, supporters of the rebels post their communiques issued from inside the besieged mansion, updates on the drama and even photographs.</p>
<p>The electronic publication "Voz Rebelde" (Rebel Voice) includes interviews with its leaders, messages of solidarity from leftist groups around the world and links to other Web sites on the MRTA in Japanese and Italian.</p>
<p>From its electronic dugout, the MRTA is carrying out a war of information against President Alberto Fujimori, who long boasted of having crushed Peru's left-wing guerrillas.</p>
<p>"Fujimori's government proclaimed a great victory over the armed movement," said Isaac Velazco, the MRTA's spokesman in exile in Europe, in an interview posted on the Internet.</p>
<p>"The government deceived itself and went as far as believing that the guerrillas, particularly the MRTA, had been defeated," he told the German publication Junge Welt. "We were never so weak as the government supposed."</p>
<p>Adorned with the MRTA shield bearing the head of Tupac Amaru, the Peruvian Indian who led an 18th-century uprising against Spanish conquerors, "Rebel Voice" is one of many guerrilla spaces on the Internet.</p>
<p>Zapatista rebels, who launched a Maya peasant uprising in southern Mexico three years ago, were among the first to stake out revolutionary cyberspace, becoming enthusiastic guerrilla hackers.</p>
<p>The Shining Path, a ruthless Maoist guerrilla group in Peru that killed thousands of people during a decade of armed violence, have had their own Web page for six months, maintained by a support group in Berkley, California.</p>
<p>Access to these Web pages is provided by groups in the United States and Canada. They are a supermarket of extremist groups brandishing causes that run from anarchism to militant environmentalism to animal liberation.</p>
<p>The MRTA page is http://burn.ucsd.edu/%7Eats/mrta.htm.</p>
<p>The site was built by "Arm the Spirit," an anarchist group based in Toronto that calls itself an "antimperialist information collective."</p>
<p>The Internet even draws together groups separated by bitter ideological differences. The Shining Path's solidarity page, http://www.csrp.org, can be used to access the Web page of their MRTA rivals.</p>
