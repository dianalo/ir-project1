<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright arrived in Moscow on Thursday for talks about the terms of a NATO-Russia charter designed to compensate the Kremlin for the allaince's eastward expansion.</p>
<p>She is due to meet Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov but it was not clear if she would see President Boris Yeltsin who cut short his holiday because of bad weather on Wednesday and returned to Moscow.</p>
<p>Albright, talking to reporters on the plane taking her to the Russian capital, vowed no concessions and said she did not expect any "miraculous dawning" as a result of Thursday's talks.</p>
<p>In the lead-up to Albright's visit, Russian leaders have kept up a barrage of rhetoric against NATO expansion.</p>
<p>The Western alliance and Russia hope to sign the charter on May 27, a few weeks before NATO announces at a Madrid summit which East European countries will be invited to join first. The Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland are front-runners.</p>
<p>The pact would give Moscow the right to close consultations with NATO on European security, but the alliance is refusing Russian demands for binding guarantees that no nuclear weapons or NATO troops will be stationed on new members' territory.</p>
