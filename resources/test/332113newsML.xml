<p>Austria's chancellor-designate Viktor Klima on Friday named Rudolf Edlinger as the country's new finance minister, sources in the ruling Social Democratic party said.</p>
<p>Klima was finance minister until he was named chancellor after the resignation of Franz Vranitzky last Saturday.  </p>
<p>The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed a report on Austrian state radio: "It's him."</p>
<p>Social Democrat Edlinger, 56, currently serves as the City of Vienna's finance councillor and has over the past week repeatedly been mentioned in Austrian media as a frontrunner for the key cabinet post.</p>
<p>Edlinger was among a team of senior leaders of Austria's coalition parties who two weeks ago hammered out a last-minute deal to sell flagship bank Creditanstalt to market leader Bank Austria, which is effectively controlled by the City of Vienna.</p>
<p>The conservative People's Party, the junior coalition partner of the Social Democrats, had objected to the sale to Bank Austria.</p>
