<p>Traders said institutions continued to liquidate their positions in the November contract and retailers remained on the sidelines.</p>
<p>"Most retail investors stayed on the sidelines due to a lack of market-moving news," one trader said.</p>
<p>"Institutions have lost interest in the November contract with the coming of its delivery date," he added.</p>
<p>Traders expect soybean to consolidate in a narrow range in the next few days.</p>
