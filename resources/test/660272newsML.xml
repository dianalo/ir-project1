<p>Shares in Shell Transport and Trading Co Plc pushed ahead on Friday following an upbeat presentation to analysts in Amsterdam yesterday, analysts said.</p>
<p>"They gave a bullish presentation on their global upstream exploration and production operations," said ABN AMRO Hoare Govett oil and gas analyst John Besant-Jones.</p>
<p>"People had been thinking that forecasts were too low anyway because of a restructuring in Shell's downstream operations and now they have an upbeat upstream story too. It appears that Shell is undergoing a corporate sea change," said Besant-Jones.</p>
<p>He said forecasts will be upgraded by 5-10 percent. Estimates range from about 5.7 billion to 6.3 billion for 1997 and between about 6.2 billion to 6.9 billion for 1998.</p>
<p>Shell executives are giving a further presentation to analysts in New York today.</p>
