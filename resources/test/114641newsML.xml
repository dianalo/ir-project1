<p>Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran was charged in absentia on Monday over the January bombing of the central bank which killed almost 100 people, court officials said.</p>
<p>They said the head of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) and nine other LTTE members, including intelligence chief Pottu Amman, were charged under the prevention of terrorism act with masterminding the bombing.</p>
<p>The charges include murder and causing damage worth millions of rupees.</p>
<p>Almost 100 people were killed and some 500 wounded when a suicide bomber rammed a truck packed with explosives into the central bank on January 31, devastating part of the capital's business district.</p>
<p>Prabhakaran's whereabouts are not known.</p>
<p>The LTTE are fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils. The government says the conflict, now in its 14th year, has claimed more than 50,000 lives.</p>
