<p>A Turkish right-wing party leader was asked at a three-way meeting with the leaders of the ruling Islamist Welfare Party (RP) and conservative True Path Party (DYP) to join their coalition, Anatolian news agency reported.</p>
<p>"At the three-way meeting, the BBP leader received an official offer to join the government from the leaders of the DYP and RP," Grand Union Party (BBP) leader Muhsin Yazicioglu was reported as telling Anatolian via an aide.  </p>
<p>Yazicioglu made the comments on Wednesday after a meeting with Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan and his deputy, DYP leader Tansu Ciller.</p>
<p>Earlier, Ciller suggested holding early polls to end a political deadlock which has hampered the Islamist-led government and badly damaged Ciller's pro-Western party.</p>
<p>Ciller's wing of the coalition has been steadily crumbling since the army began pushing Erbakan to crack down on Islamist activism in February.</p>
<p>The support of six MPs from Yazicioglu's party helped the 11-month-old government to narrowly survive a censure motion in parliament last week.</p>
