<p>President Boris Yeltsin and Chechen leader Aslan Maskhadov signed a peace accord on Monday, promising an end to 400 years of intermittent conflict between Moscow and the independence-minded north Caucasus region.</p>
<p>"We have signed a peace deal of historic dimensions, putting a full stop to 400 years of history," Yeltsin said in televised remarks after the signing ceremony.</p>
<p>"Some kind of war was going on throughout this period and the people felt insecure," added the 66-year-old Russian leader who sent troops into Chechnya in December 1994 to crush its independence drive.</p>
<p>Maskhadov, a former Soviet colonel who led the Chechen military resistance to the Russian forces, added: "Today we have ended the 400-year confrontation, regardless of those who wanted the war to continue."</p>
<p>The deal aims to turn last year's ceasefire between Moscow and the separatist region, conquered by Russia in the last century, into a lasting peace.</p>
<p>The truce had halted a 21-month war in the predominantly Moslem region in which tens of thousands of people died. It included the withdrawal of Russian troops and the deferral of any decision on Chechnya's status until 2001.</p>
<p>"The war is ending, for the first time in the history of relations between Moscow and Grozny, and the era of peace is starting," Maskhadov said as he arrived in Moscow.</p>
<p>The long history of military conflict between Russia and Chechnya includes a bitter war in the 19th century as the Chechens resisted Russia's drive to conquer the north Caucasus.</p>
<p>Soviet dictator Josef Stalin deported the whole Chechen people to Central Asia in 1944, accusing them of collaborating with the invading Nazi troops. They were only allowed to return in 1957.</p>
<p>Monday's talks were the first meeting between Yeltsin and Maskhadov since the latter was elected Chechen president in January. He has vowed to fight for full independence for his region, a demand which Moscow rejects out of hand.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said the acccord consisted of only one point. "A peace treaty has been signed. This is the gist of it."</p>
<p>Yeltsin had said the talks were aimed at declaring "our firm intention never to use force or threaten to use it in relations between the Russian Federation and the Republic of Ichkeria" -- the name favoured by the Chechen separatists.</p>
<p>The meeting took place two days after gunmen kidnapped a Russian television crew in Chechnya, posing a new challenge for the separatist leaders and souring the atmosphere.</p>
<p>It was the latest in a series of kidnappings and Russian officials said these, together with two explosions in southern Russia, had complicated the prospects for talks.</p>
<p>Both sides have blamed unspecified "parties of war" which want to wreck the peace process.</p>
<p>Analysts said Yeltsin's decision to sign the accord with Maskhadov, likely to draw criticism from the opposition, was motivated by the Kremlin's concern that further delays might undermine positions of Maskhadov, a relative moderate.</p>
<p>"It is within our powers to stop confrontation, conflicts, acts of terrorism and hostage-taking," Yeltsin said. "The Chechen authorities must secure the safety of journalists and other people working in the republic."</p>
<p>He also said all Russian servicemen held by the Chechen side must be released.</p>
<p>Later on Monday Maskhadov and Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin signed an economic cooperation accord, Interfax news agency said. It is aimed at opening the way for economic aid from Moscow to the region, much of which was destroyed in the Russian military operations.</p>
<p>Chechnya was a major oil processing centre in the Soviet days and an oil pipeline linking oil-rich Azerbaijan with the Russian port of Novorossiisk goes through its territory.</p>
