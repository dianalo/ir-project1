<p>Australian government and industry sources said they are not aware of international moves to revive the gentlemen's agreement to restrain growth in aluminium production.</p>
<p>David Coutts, executive director of Australia's Aluminium Development Council, said the Aluminium Council was not pushing to restrict production.</p>
<p>The council's members in Australia, which include the major companies, also did not know of such a move by Russia, he said. An official of the Federal government's Department of Primary Industries and Energy, who did not wish to be named but who has just returned from a visit to Europe and Russia, said she was unable to comment.</p>
<p>She declined to indicate whether she believed it likely that the lapsed former agreement was likely to be resurrected.</p>
<p>Industry sources said they were not surprised by Russia floating ideas about the resurrection of an aluminium production agreement because of the present state of the market.</p>
<p>Russia was exacerbating the present aluminium market slide by pumping it with low-priced product, they said.</p>
<p>In previous years in a similar market situation pressure grew for trade sanctions.  </p>
<p>The Russians might be trying to get governments to talk about a new MOU before matters reached that stage, they said.</p>
<p>It would surprise if Canada supported a new MOU, they said.</p>
<p>The Canadians and Americans had been very nervous about anti-trust issues, they said.</p>
<p>The Australian comments follow reports that Russia would support proposals to resume the MOU between the six major world aluminium producing countries to restrain growth in aluminium production.</p>
<p>Countries involved at government level in the MOU were the EU, Norway, Australia, U.S., Canada and Russia.  </p>
<p>The two-year global deal to reduce output by 10 percent was signed in March 1994 by the major producers.</p>
