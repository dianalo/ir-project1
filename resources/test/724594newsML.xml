<p>Ignoring Russian objections, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told the three Baltic states on Sunday that they were "serious candidates ... on the road" to NATO membership.</p>
<p>Albright, on an East European tour, sought to reassure Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that Washington supported their eventual membership even though a NATO summit last week gave no indication when they might to be invited to join the Western military alliance.</p>
<p>But she coupled her words of encouragement with a clear signal that if the three former Soviet republics were to join NATO, they must improve their ties with their former master Russia.</p>
<p>This would have to include treatment of Russian minorities in the Baltic states.</p>
<p>Albright travelled to the Lithuanian capital Vilnius to meet all three Baltic foreign ministers after talks in St Petersburg with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov.</p>
<p>U.S. officials said she and Primakov had agreed to seek an extension of current talks on updating a European conventional arms treaty in a bid to reach a framework agreement by the end of July.</p>
<p>The NATO summit in Madrid invited Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary to become the first ex-communist countries to apply to join NATO and dropped a broad hint that Romania and Slovenia could be next in line.</p>
<p>Albright said no decision had been taken on who would be in the second wave. "The Baltic states are serious candidates for future NATO membership... they are on the road," she told a news conference.</p>
<p>The Baltic states were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union during World War Two and became independent in 1991. Still fearful for their freedom, the three countries are anxious to gain the protection of NATO membership as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Baltic ministers -- Algirdas Saudargas of Lithuania, Toomas Ilves of Estonia and Valdis Birkavs of Latvia -- said the Madrid summit had brought them closer to membership and hailed its reference to the Baltic states as aspiring members.</p>
<p>Albright said one obstacle to the Baltic states joining at present was their limited military capability.</p>
<p>Their membership would have to wait until they were able to take on the responsibilities of members and serve alliance interests.</p>
<p>As a stopgap measure the United States is working on a "Baltic charter" with the three countries, expected to be signed later this year. U.S. officials said it contained no security guarantees but did call for consultations in case of a threat to a state.</p>
<p>Russia, which has grudgingly accepted NATO's first wave of enlargement, has said it may tear up a recently signed charter of cooperation with NATO if former Soviet republics are admitted to the alliance.</p>
<p>While U.S. officials have shrugged off that threat, Albright said in a speech to Vilnius University students on Sunday that a key to allaying Russian fears was for the Baltic states themselves to improve ties with Moscow.</p>
<p>"We must continue to make clear that NATO enlargement is not directed at Russia -- and you must help us," she said. "This process is not about escaping west, it is about gaining the confidence to look to the east in a spirit of cooperation."</p>
<p>Albright also warned against "destructive nationalism" and told reporters that she had raised the issue of treatment of Russian minorities -- sizeable in Latvia and Estonia -- with the Baltic leaders.</p>
<p>"I think that those whom it concerns understand the importance of resolving minority issues," she said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Albright and Primakov agreed to try to speed up the current round of Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) talks, grouping 30 nations in Vienna, which is due to end shortly.</p>
<p>A senior U.S. official said Albright and Primakov "agreed to jointly recommend to the negotiators in Vienna to stay in session till the end of the month to see if their efforts could yield a framework agreement for an amended CFE treaty".</p>
<p>The original treaty, signed in 1990, set limits on the tanks, artillery pieces, aircraft and other non-nuclear arms that European states could hold.</p>
<p>But the pact needs revision because of major political changes on the continent since then.</p>
