<p>A former chairman of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, one of the firms involved in a racketeer scandal, attempted suicide on Sunday, police said.</p>
<p>They said that Kuniji Miyazaki, 67, was taken to hospital after trying to hang himself at his Tokyo home. Prosecutors had called in Miyazaki on Friday for questioning in the affair in which racketeers extorted money from the bank.  </p>
<p>DKB, along with Japan's Nomura Securities, is at the centre of the scandal, in which payoffs were made to the "sokaiya" racketeers to win silence at annual shareholder meetings.</p>
<p>Both companies held their annual meetings on Friday. DKB management said it would ensure that the bank would sever all ties with racketeers.</p>
<p>Miyazaki stepped down as a senior adviser to DKB in mid-June after admitting he had ties with a racketeer. He was chairman when 11.78 billion yen ($103 million) in payoffs to a sokaiya were made between July 1994 and September 1996.</p>
<p>On Thursday, four former executives of DKB were indicted on charges of making the payments to Ryuichi Koike, the racketeer at the centre of the scandal. They were the first Dai-Ichi Kangyo executives to be indicted in the case.</p>
