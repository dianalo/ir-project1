<p>Mt Leyshon Gold Mines Ltd on Tuesday reported a consolidated net profit for the nine months to March 31 of A$15.1 million.</p>
<p>The unaudited profit for the third quarter was A$5.7 million, the company said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Mt Leyshon, which is subject to a takeover offer from fellow gold miner St Barbara Mines Ltd, recorded a previous nine-month net profit of A$19.4 million.</p>
<p>Third quarter net profit last year was A$8.5 million.</p>
<p>Mt Leyshon said gold sales for the quarter were 54,836 ounces at an average realised price of A$587 an ounce, compared with an average spot price for the period of A$451 an ounce.</p>
<p>The total cash cost rose 10.1 percent on the previous quarter to A$327 an ounce due to a fall in mill feed grade, the company said.  </p>
<p>Mt Leyshon, which is 75 percent owned by Normandy Mining Ltd, reiterated its opposition to St Barbara's bid.</p>
<p>"In particular, whilst exploration potential in the Meekatharra district is perceived to be excellent, the history of mining is characterised by low grade, high cost operations," it said.</p>
<p>The main asset of St Barbara, which has offered 32 of its shares for every 10 Mt Leyshon shares, is its Bluebird operation near Meekatharra in Western Australia.  </p>
<p>Mt Leyshon also said it was aware of "the remaining significant surplus cashflow" forecast from the Mt Leyshon operation.</p>
<p>It was reviewing options including a return to shareholders though dividend payments, the development of another operation or the funding of additional exploration.</p>
