<headline>LPC-BT sets bank loan, bond issue for Huntsman.</headline>
<text>
<p>NEW YORK, Jan 8 (LPC) - Bankers Trust New York Corp is arranging bank loan and bond transactions totaling $480 million to fund Huntsman Corp's $600 million acquisition of Texaco Inc's remaining chemical operation in Texas, banking sources said.</p>
<p>The transaction is an example of the "one-stop shopping" approach that banks and investment banks are focusing on heavily, lenders said. In one-stop shopping, a financial institution leads several types of financing and provides advisory services, bankers said.  </p>
<p>For Huntsman, BT has fully underwritten a $300 million senior bank loan while BT Securities Corp is lead arranger on a $180 million bond tranche, sources said. Both tranches will be marketed in February, sources added.</p>
<p>Chase Manhattan Bank and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette were among the bidders vying for the mandate, a number of bankers said.</p>
<p>The $300 million, seven-year bank loan will be split between a $50 million revolving credit and a $250 million term loan, a banker said.</p>
<p>The acquisition will be orchestrated through a newly formed, as-yet unnamed division of Huntsman, sources said.</p>
<p>Texaco sold the bulk of its chemical business to Huntsman in 1994 for more than $1 billion.</p>
