<title>USA: Oracle to license technology.</title>
<headline>Oracle to license technology.</headline>

<p>Oracle Corp is set to expand its product offering to the downstream oil industry by licensing a technology from annother company, analysts said Friday.</p>
<p>Oracle told analysts at a breakfast Thursday that it would acquire the technology for an unnamed company in exchange for a small royalty payment, said Jim Moore, an Alex Brown analyst who attended the meeting.</p>
<p>The licensing deal is in keeping with Oracle's strategy to expand by developing applications that target different industries.  </p>
<p>"This deals with refining, transportation and by-products and it is a very sophisticated application that is very hard to put together, so they decided to license it," Moore said.</p>
<p>Analysts could not confirm published reports, which followed the meeting, that Oracle might be planning to acquire Red Brick Systems Inc.</p>
<p>"There is no way Oracle would buy that company," said one analyst who asked not be named. "That would not add anything to what Oracle has. Red Brick doesn't offer Oracle anything."</p>
<p>Jim Mendelson, an analyst at SoundView Financial Corp who attended the meeting with Oracle, said he heard no mention of a possible bid for Red Brick.</p>
<p>Red Brick said a buyout by Oracle was not likely.</p>
<p>"I've heard absolutely nothing about the potential for them to make any kind of a bid," said Mark Olson, a spokesman for Red Brick.</p>
