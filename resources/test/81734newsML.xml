<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) plan to slash the top income tax rate in Germany to just under 40 percent from 53 percent, the newspaper Die Welt said in its Saturday edition.</p>
<p>It said the proposal was contained in a draft motion to be presented to a forthcoming CDU party conference in Hanover.</p>
<p>Die Welt said the proposal by CDU parliamentary leader Wolfgang Schaeuble had been agreed with Finance Minister Theo Waigel, of the Bavarian CSU, and would save taxpayers 20 billion marks a year from January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>The report said the CDU planned, at the same time, to scrap an extensive range of tax breaks and privileges for both companies and wage-earners.</p>
