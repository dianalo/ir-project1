<p>The Munich city government on Monday opened a controversial exhibition challenging the notion that ordinary German soldiers had nothing to do with Nazi excesses during World War Two.</p>
<p>Conservative Bavarian opponents of the event drew sharp criticism from Mayor Christian Ude, who said it opened the way for public debate on the sensitive subject.</p>
<p>Ude said local leaders of the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) were behind a nationwide campaign against the exhibition and he denouced them for refusing to accept historical facts about Wehrmacht crimes.</p>
<p>"It is not the people of Munich (who are against the exhibition), but a party, namely the leadership of the CSU in Munich," Ude, a Social Democrat (SPD), said. "We need a display on the topic. It is the necessary first step in getting a public debate going."</p>
<p>Local CSU leaders planned to a protest outside the Munich city hall housing the exhibition, which it said defamed the German people.</p>
<p>The Christian Social Union (CSU), which rules the southern state with an absolute majority, also wanted to lay a wreath at the city's memorial to the "Unknown Soldier", which pays tribute to nameless thousands who died fighting for Germany.</p>
<p>But Ude said the CSU was no different from right-wing radicals in its reaction to the exhibition and he accused the party of leading a campaign against a necessary discussion of the army's crimes.</p>
<p>The CSU finds itself in the company of neo-Nazis in opposing "War of Extermination -- Crimes of the Wehrmacht 1941-1944", an exhibition by the Hamburg Institute for Social Research documenting the atrocities of Hitler's Wehrmacht.</p>
<p>Munich CSU leader Peter Gauweiler has even suggested Jan Philipp Reemtsma, the institute's patron who used to own one of Germany's biggest tobacco firms, would be better advised to stage an exhibtion on people who have died from smoking.</p>
<p>"The people behind this exhibition are not exactly pillars of democracy," said Gauweiler, accusing the exhibit's backers of supporting left-wing extremist groups.</p>
<p>The exhibition uses photographs and letters from soldiers themselves to back up its premise that the regular army also participated in mass killings of the Jews and other atrocities, not just the SS units usually blamed for war crimes.</p>
<p>The organiser of the exhibition, historian Hannes Heer, said the CSU was trying to challenge "undisputed historical facts".</p>
<p>Heer said the Wehrmacht had been the second pillar of Hitler's violent regime and was responsible for millions of deaths, although that did not mean that every ordinary soldier was a criminal.</p>
<p>The exhibition stirred up a big debate when it was unveiled in Hamburg two years ago but has since toured more than a dozen German cities provoking little controversy.</p>
<p>But Munich, which had the status of "Capital city of the Movement" during the Nazi era, is proving very different.</p>
<p>Ude accused the CSU of paving the way for a demonstration planned by right-wing extremists for Saturday against the exhibition under the title "Our grandfathers were no criminals -- and we're proud of them!".</p>
<p>Ude called the demonstration unwanted in Munich and branded it "particularly tasteless" because of the route it will follow.</p>
<p>It is due to begin in a square named in honour of Hans and Sophie Scholl, a brother and sister who headed an anti-Nazi group during the Third Reich, and end at the Feldherrenhalle, a favourite rallying point of the Nazis in the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
<p>Supporters of the exhibition, including the SDP, Greens, trade unionists and church groups, plan a counter-demonstration.</p>
