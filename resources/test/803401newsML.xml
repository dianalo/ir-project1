<p>Swedish shares fell sharply towards the end of the session on Friday as Wall Street opened in a bad mood and shares tumbled in the last 90 minutes of trading.</p>
<p>The OMX Index fell 1.97 percent to 2,553.23, pulling back at the close after having been down 2.8 percent shortly after Wall Street opened with a hangover.</p>
<p>The bank and insurance sector was the weakest of the day in Sweden, falling 2.6 percent.</p>
<p>"The banks had been in demand earlier because of all the rumours about restructuring and I think investors will be scared off by the increase in rates in the U.S.," one broker said.</p>
<p>Insurer Trygg Hansa bucked the trend, rising 2.0 crowns to 169.50 crowns.</p>
<p>Falls were across the board, with majors Ericsson, down 6.5 to 348.5, and Astra, down 2.5 to 134, accounting for a large chunk of the 5.5 billion crown turnover.</p>
