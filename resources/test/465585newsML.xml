<p>LIFFE robusta coffee futures flipped up in the afternoon after initial fund selling, which had pressured prices much lower in the morning, ran its course.</p>
<p>After driving prices down by seven percent on Monday in one of the heaviest losses in recent months, the funds continued to liquidate their long positions this morning.</p>
<p>It took benchmark May to a low of $1,515 and ended the morning trade $16 down at $1,525 a tonne.</p>
<p>But the selling abated and the market soon regained its poise in the afternoon after New York headed higher. By the close, May was $26 up on the day at $1,567.</p>
<p>"There was no fund selling in New York and this helped restore some confidence in London," said one trader.</p>
<p>The gains were also underpinned by short-covering ahead of the long Easter weekend and book-squaring before the close of the financial year for some.</p>
<p>Overall volume reached 8,620 lots. May/July switch was again active, standing at $13 over by the close against $20 on Monday.</p>
<p>There was no fresh news and traders said the upward move was also seen as a technical correction to Monday's oversold conditions.</p>
<p>Immediately, the May contract may find support at $1,500-$1,515 while the upside objective is seen at $1,600-$1,610 area.</p>
