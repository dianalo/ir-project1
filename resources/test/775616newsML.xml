<p>Taiwan's money rates ended sharply higher on Monday on tightening liquidity as many financial institutions adopted a cautious policy on the beginning of a new reserve period, dealers said.</p>
<p>The overnight interbank rate closed at 7.499 percent against Saturday's 6.277 finish -- well above the central bank's 5.0-5.5 percent target zone but far below the record double-digit closes of late June.</p>
<p>The 30-day commercial paper also rose to 7.25-7.50 percent against 6.50-6.75.  </p>
<p>Dealers said state-run Chiao Tung Bank's auction of T$30 billion worth of shares also tightened liquidity.</p>
<p>They said central bank's raise of rediscount rates and secured loan rates by 0.25 percentage point effective Friday had squeezed fund flows.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the money rates to remain in the current high level in the near term.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the benchmark 86/4 bond yields rose, reflecting the central bank's interest rate hikes, dealers said.  </p>
<p>The 86/4 bond yield was at 6.1375 against 6.1325.</p>
