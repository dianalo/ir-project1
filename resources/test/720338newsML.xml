<p>British investment bank Hambros Plc said on Thursday its head of corporate finance and two other senior bankers had resigned following an independent probe into its role in a failed bid for the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS) earlier this year.</p>
<p>It said the inquiry by law firm Norton Rose had found while those concerned in the bid at Hambros had not had any dishonest intent, their conduct "fell well short of the standards of good business practice". There had also been failures of implementation of Hambros' internal control procedures.  </p>
<p>Hambros said the report had found those at Hambros who knew that confidential information from CWS had or might become available without proper authority "failed to appreciate that it was not appropriate for them either to receive or use that information".</p>
<p>It said it would introduce recommended changes to tighten internal controls and bring in some additional procedures.</p>
<p>These include client and transaction clearance procedures, a strengthening of the compliance function and its relationship with the corporate finance division and "a number of other improvements and safeguards in systems".</p>
<p>The bank said it was not possible to publish the report for legal reasons but it had been sent to the Bank of England and the Securities and Futures Authority. It will introduce the changes suggested as quickly as possible and will institute further reviews of high level internal controls.</p>
<p>Nigel Pantling, head of the corporate finance division, has resigned and will be replaced by William Nabarro. Peter Large and Andrew Salmon, who were directly involved in the transaction, have also resigned with immediate effect.</p>
<p>A number of members of staff are also subject to internal disciplinary measures, Hambros said.</p>
<p>Hambros advised entrepreneur Andrew Regan and his Galileo bidding vehicle in its 1.2 billion pound ($2 billion) attempt to takeover mutually-owned supermarkets-to-funeral parlours group CWS. The bid collapsed after prolonged legal action by CWS and the withdrawal of key financial backing.</p>
