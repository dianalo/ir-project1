<p>Forty-two parties will run for Algeria's 380-seat National Assembly with the main political forces fielding their leaders in Algiers constituency, the poll's big prize with 24 seats, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials expect about 4,000 candidates to run for seats in the June 5 parliamentary elections in the North African country where more than five years of violence followed the cancellation of the last general election.</p>
<p>About 60,000 people have been killed in violence pitting Moslem guerrillas against government forces. The latest deaths -- 93 in a massacre earlier this week -- stunned the country and overshadowed preparations for the poll.</p>
<p>The government extended to Thursday a Monday deadline for candidates to complete individual application forms when the final number will be officially known, officials said.</p>
<p>Only three parties -- the former ruling National Liberation Front, legal Islamist Nahda and National Democratic Rally (RND) -- fielded condidates in all Algeria's 48 provinces and among Algerian expatriates in Europe and other countries, said the officials, contacted by telephone.</p>
<p>Several ministers, including Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia, are standing in the one-stage poll under the RND flag. The RND, grouping President Liamine Zeroual's supporters, held its founding congress early this month.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Abdelkrim Harchaoui runs as RND candidate in the eastern province of Setif which will have 16 seats, the largest constituency after Algiers.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Ahmed Attaf is also an RND candidate in Ain Defla, southwest of Algiers.</p>
<p>Ouyahia will defend the RND flag in Algiers against hawkish anti-Islamist Democracy and Culture Rally opposition chief Said Saadi, main secular opposition Socialist Forces Front (FFS) leader Seddik Debaili and other opposition politicians.</p>
<p>Algeria has been without an elected parliament since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had taken a commanding lead.</p>
<p>The outlawed FIS has called on Algerians to boycott the poll saying it would be neither fair nor free.</p>
<p>Former Algerian president Ahmed Ben Bella's Movement for Democracy in Algeria (MDA) party said it would stay away from the vote, saying the country needed a peaceful solution to end bloodshed through dialogue between opposition and the government before polls were held.</p>
<p>The radical anti-Islamist Ettahaddi party, which says Algeria needs to wipe out all Islamist groups, including legal ones, will also boycott the poll.</p>
