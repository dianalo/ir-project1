<p>German media giant Bertelsmann AG said on Thursday profits rose in the first half of its 1996/97 business year as sales in the period jumped 4.9 percent to 11.4 billion marks.</p>
<p>"We have achieved our most important goals and feel that we are well-positioned on international media markets," said Bertelsmann chairman Mark Woessner.  </p>
<p>In the first six months of the business year that ends on June 30, domestic sales grew 7.8 percent to around four billion marks, while foreign revenues rose 3.3 percent to 7.4 billion marks.</p>
<p>Bertelsmann said in a statement that this marked the first time for "a long while" that domestic sales growth outpaced its expansion on international markets.</p>
<p>"Consolidated turnover in the full 1996/97 year will probably rise to 22.5 billion marks," the company said.</p>
<p>"Profits also improved in the first six months of the current business year," it said, adding that it expected net income to rise in the full year. It gave no detailed forecast.</p>
<p>Bertelsmann group sales totalled 21.5 billion marks in the business year to the end of June 1996. Group net profit was 905 million marks.</p>
<p>On the basis of its half-year report and forecasts for the full year, Bertelsmann said it expects to pay a return of 15 percent on its profit-sharing certificates. The payout will be made at the end of November.  </p>

<p>Bertelsmann is not a listed company, but its profit-participation certificates are traded. The company's policy is to pay a return of 15 percent on the certificates provided the company's return on assets is at least 12 percent.</p>
<p>Despite continued strong investment during the first half of 1996/97, Bertelsmann said financial liabilities fell to 343 million marks, down by 107 million marks.</p>
<p>Investment in financial assets was 559 million marks, down slightly from 566 million marks the year before.</p>
<p>Fixed asset investments totalled 341 million marks, of which the largest expenditures were made by the book division, magazine and newspaper publisher Gruner+Jahr and the printing division. Fixed asset investments in the entertainment sector were made largely in European film and television.</p>
<p>Investment in immaterial assets was 192 million marks, mainly by BMG Entertainment.</p>
<p>Financial investments of 26 million marks played a "relatively small role" in the period, the company said.</p>
