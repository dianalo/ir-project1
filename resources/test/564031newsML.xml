<p>The sister of accused Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh testified against him on Monday, calling him a man who wanted to take action against a tyrannical government depriving Americans of their rights.</p>
<p>In a calm, quiet voice, 23-year-old part-time bar worker Jennifer McVeigh told of numerous meetings and letters in which her brother described his rising anger over the bloody showdown at Waco and his belief that law enforcement agencies were fascists.</p>
<p>"He indicated he was not in the propaganda stage -- not passing out leaflets any more -- he was now in the action stage," she said of a meeting she had with him in late 1994.</p>
<p>Then she described letters she received from him in early 1995 -- before the April 19 explosion that killed 168 people at the Alfred P. Murrah federal building -- in which he said, "I won't be back ... forever" and warned her to beware of government agents and phone taps.</p>
<p>The jury, which appeared bored by many hours of technical testimony earlier in the day, paid rapt attention and McVeigh stared without emotion at her, occasionally dropping his eyes when she described the sharpness of his political views.</p>
<p>McVeigh, who faces the death penalty if convicted, is accused of organising and carrying out the most deadly attack on civilians in U.S. history. He has pleaded not guilty. His sister testified under a grant of immunity from prosecution.</p>
<p>Under prodding from prosecution attorney Beth Wilkenson, Jennifer McVeigh read a letter that her brother wrote on her computer to the American Legion in the fall of 1994 after the two of them had viewed a video of the April 19, 1993, confrontation betweeen the FBI and the Branch Davidian religious sect at Waco, Texas, in which more than 80 people died.</p>
<p>"He was very angry that the government murdered the people there and gassed and burned them. He blamed the BATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) and the FBI and he felt that somebody should be held accountable and that the government would not hold the agents accountable," she said.</p>
<p>McVeigh's letter to the veterans' group was a call to arms beginning with the phrase "Constitutional Defenders."</p>
<p>It said, "We members of the constitutional militias do not bear our arms to overthrow the Constitution but to overthrow those who PERVERT the Constitution; if and when they once again draw first blood (many believe the Waco incident was first blood) ... The BATF are one such fascist federal group who are infamous for depriving Americans of their liberties."</p>
<p>He also called the FBI, DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) and the U.S. Marshal Service similiar fascist groups.</p>
<p>He called for a "citizen's militia" to take action, saying, "Who else will come to the rescue of those innocent women and children of Waco? Surely not the local sheriff or the state police. Nor the army, who are used overseas to 'restore democracy' but are used to destroy it ... at places like Waco."</p>
<p>Prosecutor Wilkenson asked Jennifer McVeigh if she helped her brother with the letter and she answered, "I discussed sentence structure and tried to make corrections." The courtroom laughed and the defendant smiled.</p>
<p>The young woman, dressed in a conservative blue blazer and white turtle-neck sweater, identified her brother's handwriting on a series of letters and notes that the prosecution plans to use to prove that he carried out the attack, fuelled by extreme rightwing ideas and inspired by an anti-government, anti-Semitic novel called "The Turner Diaries."</p>
<p>In the book, FBI headquarters in Washington is destroyed by a fertiliser truck bomb.</p>
<p>She identified a note he made on a business card for a military supply company that was found in McVeigh's 1977 Mercury Marquis shortly after his arrest about 90 minutes after the explosion in a town 75 miles (120 km) north of Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>McVeigh's handwritten notation on the business card read: "TNT, $5 a stick. Need more. Call after 1 May, see if I can get some more."</p>
<p>The card was found by Oklahoma State Trooper Charles Hanger, who arrested McVeigh after he noticed that the Mercury had no license plate, and discovered that McVeigh was in possession of a gun and a knife.</p>
