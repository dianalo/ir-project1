<text>
<p>Blue-chip stocks rebounded sharply Wednesday from their week-long losing streak, propelling the market to its biggest rally in nearly four weeks.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended up 84.66 points at 6,740.74, its best gain since Jan. 3, when it surged 102 points.</p>
<p>But in the broader market, advancing issues led declines 1,239 to 1,156 on heavy volume of 496 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market's extreme volatility prompted investors to seek the relative safety of big-name blue-chip stocks.</p>
<p>"Today the name of the game was the blue chips," said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray &amp; Co. "There's still a lot of nervousness in the small cap names."</p>
<p>The cautious mood was also reflected in Nasdaq's performance, said analysts. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite index managed only a fractional gain of 0.80 of a point to 1,355.17, while drug stocks and other big-name defensive stocks fared better.</p>
<p>"Generally, the feeling is that (drug stocks) are a really good place to be," said Robert Froehlich, chief investment strategist at Van Kampen American Capital.</p>
<p>"The industry has improved its earnings over the last two or three years and the consensus opinion says the economy will slow in the second half of the year," he said. Such a slowdown would not hurt drug companies, which are relatively immune to economic business cycles.</p>
<p>Analysts said several upcoming events are pivotal for the market's overall outlook, particularly Friday's fourth quarter Gross Domestic Product report and Thursday's testimony by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on the state of the economy  before the Senate Finance Committee. Greenspan's testimony begins at 10 a.m.</p>
<p>"Unless one of those events produces a surprise, the market should try to rally here," said Dan Ascani, president and director of research at Global Market Strategists Inc. "A bounce of some kind here would be normal."</p>
<p>But even if stocks do manage a near-term recovery, Ascani said, "We're about out of January now, so the market will probably have a rough road ahead."</p>
<p>The concern is that when January ends, with it may go the furious inflow of retirement fund cash that has provided an important source of market momentum, particularly for big-name stocks, which have boomed in recent months.</p>
<p>Analysts did see some reasons to be optimistic that a new rally could be in the making, however, if the economy proves to be more resilient than expected.</p>
<p>"We could have a banner day on Friday with a strong fourth quarter GDP," Froehlich said. "With labour costs not going through the roof and a strong economy, the stock market could decide, 'This looks good for earnings.'"</p>
<p>In the bond market, the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 7/32 of a point, which lowered its yield to 6.91 percent from Tuesday's close of 6.93 percent.</p>
<p>In individual issues, International Business Machines Corp. continued to bounce back from its recent sell-off, gaining 5-1/2 to 156-1/4.</p>
<p>360 Communications Co. fell three to 19 after the company warned of weaker than expected fourth quarter earnings.</p>
<p>Quantum Corp. gained 3-1/4 to 36-3/8. Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock after it reported better-than-expected earnings.</p>
<p>Mercury Finance Co. failed to open for trading. The company said it found problems in its bookkeeping that caused it to overstate earnings by $90 million over four years and that its chief accountant had apparently disappeared.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 7.48 to 772.50. The American Stock Exchange index slipped 0.40 to 587.67.</p>
<p>The NYSE Composite index of all listed common stocks rose 3.23 to 406.09. The average share was up 33 cents.</p>
<p>The Wilshire Associates Equity Index -- the market value of NYSE, American and Nasdaq issues -- was 7,464.067 up 49.14 or 0.66 percent.</p>
