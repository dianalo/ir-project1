<p>A sharp earthquake jolted the central Philipine city of Tacloban on Wednesday, triggering a stampede in some buildings but there were no immediate reports of casualty or damage, residents said.</p>
<p>"It was quite strong. All of my staff, about 25 of us, ran out of the building. But all of us are safe," Dalmacio Grafil, publisher of the Leyte-Samar Weekly Express newspaper, said by telephone from Tacloban, a city of about 200,000 people.</p>
<p>People in restaurants in the city centre also ran out into the streets, radio reports said.</p>
<p>Government seismologists in Manila said they were still collecting data to find out how strong the tremor was.</p>
