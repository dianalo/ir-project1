<p>Japanese electronics firm Sanyo Electric Co. Ltd. said Thursday it developed a 15-inch, high-resolution three-dimensional display for which users do not need to wear special glasses.</p>
<p>The screen, which Sanyo said is larger than previous 3D displays that do not require glasses, includes a sensor that detects the position of the viewer's head and adjusts images automatically for the left and right eyes.</p>
<p>The display is an XGA resolution, liquid crystal display with 1,024 by 768 pixels, Sanyo said.</p>
<p>"This allows the viewer an unprecedented range of motion, thus expanding the scope of 3D viewing," Sanyo said, adding that the display also offered more realistic images.</p>
<p>The display can be used with workstations and personal computers, and will also be used in surgical and diagnostic medical equipment, games and driving and flight simulations, Sanyo said.</p>
<p>Sanyo, which said it developed the world's first 3D display that does not require glasses in 1994, has already marketed four-, six- and 10-inch displays for commercial, medical and entertainment uses.</p>
