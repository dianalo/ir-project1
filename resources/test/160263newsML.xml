<p>The stockmarket was cheered by U.S. unemployment data but weak forestries dragged shares to a lower close and the All Saints' holiday mood bit into trade, brokers said.</p>
<p>The HEX index edged down 0.18 percent to 2197.85. Volume was fair at 312 million markka.</p>
<p>"At least there should be no fear of a rate hike," said one broker, referring to non-farm payrolls figures which were seen confirming a U.S. economic slowdown from last spring.</p>
<p>But there were also calls for caution.</p>
<p>"Next Tuesday are the U.S. presidential elections and then it will be a whole new game, so Finnish investors have reason to be cautious," one broker said.</p>
<p>Nokia was mainly stable and closed down only fractionally, shedding 0.40 to 209.00 markka.</p>
<p>Analog mobile phone maker Benefon soared 11.00 markka, or over 15 percent, to 82.00 markka after it on Thursday announced a deal with Ericsson on continuing development of NMT 450 networks for which Benefon is a significant handset producer.</p>
<p>Buyers were both domestic and foreign, brokers said.</p>
<p>Forestries continued to ail on a bleak outlook, brokers said. UPM-Kymmene closed down 1.50 at 90.50 markka, and Metsa-Serla was flat at 31.50 markka, while Enso managed to add 0.20 to 35.70.</p>
<p>Computer services and software house TT Tieto rose on speculative buying ahead of its January-September result due next Wednesday.</p>
<p>Sudden restlessness on the bond and money markets, which sent the yield curve higher across the board and widened the yield gap over Germany, also knocked the HEX down 1.7 percent for the week.</p>
<p>Next week, the U.S. presidential vote and Clinton's statements if he wins were expected to be closely watched.</p>
<p>Eyes would also be on banking group Merita, due to report January-September results on Thursday, brokers said.</p>
<p>The median of analysts' Merita forecasts was for a 952 million markka operating profit after credit losses, up from 482 million in the same period in 1995.</p>
