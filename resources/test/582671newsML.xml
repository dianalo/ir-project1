<title>USA: Coffee prices soar; producers warn of supply problems.</title>
<headline>Coffee prices soar; producers warn of supply problems.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>A bull market is raging in world coffee, and scarce supplies have sent speculators on a buying spree.</p>
<p>The price of coffee futures on the New York Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange extended its longest sustained rally in two decades Wednesday on news that Latin American supplies are tight and U.S. inventories of high quality coffee beans are at 20-year lows.</p>
<p>The May coffee contract gained 0.50 cent to close at $2.615 a pound, a level unseen since frost last hit Brazil's coffee crop in 1994. The price has doubled since the start of the year.</p>
<p>The market still has to face the start in July of this year's frost season in Brazil.</p>
<p>On the London market, prices for the less-prized robusta coffees stand at their highest in a year. And retail prices threaten to rise again at the supermarket check-out.</p>
<p>"There is no more coffee in the producer countries," Guy-Alain Gauze, Commodity Minister of Ivory Coast, told Reuters in a Singapore interview. "We are really facing problems with production."</p>
<p>Colombia's National Coffee Growers' Federation says it is finding it hard to meet export commitments.</p>
<p>"There's very little coffee in Colombia. The federation is having enormous difficulties meeting its commitments," its head, Jorge Cardenas, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Colombia is the second largest coffee producer after Brazil.</p>
<p>Traders say speculative commodity funds have "really got hold" of coffee futures now and that, with inventories low, talk of cold weather in Brazil will prey on traders' minds.</p>
<p>"A frost this year would cause chaos in world coffee markets," the British brokerage house GNI said. "The market will therefore be incredibly sensitive to any frost threat over the next 15 weeks."</p>
<p>The 1994 frosts cut Brazil's 1995/96 crop by 50 percent and sent coffee futures prices to 10-year highs. Since then, coffee has ridden a rollercoaster.</p>
