<p>Pakistani cotton rates closed steady on Tuesday and dealers at the private Karachi Cotton Association said rates were likely to ease in the next few days on higher supplies of new (1997/98 July-June) crop from farms to ginneries.</p>
<p>"Higher supplies of cotton have kept prices almost stable," dealer Nasim Usman said. Spinners had stepped up buying as the quality of new cotton was good.</p>
<p>In the kerb market, NIAB-78 variety was quoted at 2,325/2,350 rupees per maund (37.32 kg), K-68 at 2,500/2,525 and MNH-93 at 2,500/2,525.</p>
<p>The Association said exporters had shipped 125,515 (375-lb) bales of cotton by June 28 compared to 1.82 million in the same time a year ago. Exporters had registered contracts for the export of 164,756 bales by July 8 compared to 2.32 million in the same time a year ago.</p>
