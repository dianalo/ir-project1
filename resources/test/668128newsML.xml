<p>New Zealand's competition regulator, the Commerce Commission, said on Tuesday it had cleared Australian food producer Goodman Fielder to buy the New Zealand assets of baker Defiance Mills Ltd, subject to Goodman divesting certain milling assets.  </p>
<p>Commission chairman Alan Bollard said the commission was satisfied that, should the acquistion go ahead with divestments, Goodman would not acquire or strengthen a dominant position.</p>
<p>In April, the commission declined Goodman's initial A$48 million bid proposal saying it would gain dominance in seven market areas.</p>
<p>Goodman and Defiance have extensive milling and baking operations in New Zealand.  </p>
<p>The dominance concerns were largely removed by Goodman's fresh proposal to divest its Christchurch mill to competitor Allied Foods Ltd, a unit of George Weston Foods Ltd, Bollard said.</p>
<p>Even though the acquisition would result in high market shares being held in several markets, the commission was satisfied that existing competitors could expand and new ones could enter the markets if Goodman hiked prices.</p>
<p>Defiance NZ said in a statement that a shareholder meeting had been called for June 27 to approve the sale. Following that, it was expected to settle on June 30.  </p>
