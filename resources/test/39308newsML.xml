<p>From Atlantic coastal towns to inland farms, North Carolina faced a massive cleanup on Saturday in the wake of Hurricane Fran, one of the most ferocious storms to hit the state.</p>
<p>"This is the worst storm we've had in a long, long time," said North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt. "I would say this is one of the two or three worst storms I've seen in 30-40 years."</p>
<p>The storm left at least 12 people dead in the Carolinas. North Carolina officials said they had had reports of 10 deaths linked to the storm, mostly from traffic accidents and fallen trees. One of the dead was a 10-year-old boy who was killed when a tree crushed his trailer home.</p>
<p>South Carolina reported two other deaths. In addition, four people died in a fire in a trailer home near Myrtle beach. However, investigators said they had not yet determined if the fire was linked to the storm.</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton on Friday night declared Virginia a major disaster area after the storm wreaked havoc throughout the state. Earlier, Clinton had declared North Carolina a disaster area, making victims eligible for federal assistance.</p>
<p>"We will do everything we can to help the people of Virginia recover from the effects of Hurricane Fran," Clinton said in a statement.</p>
<p>Fran hit the coast at Cape Fear late on Thursday and cut a wide path of destruction as it ploughed inland from seaside communities near Wilmington to the capital Raleigh and beyond.</p>
<p>About 4.5 million people in the Carolinas and Virginia were left without power after Fran stormed ashore, snapping power lines, tossing signs and billboards and clogging streets with debris. Its powerful tidal surge crumbled buildings in beach communities and winds of up to 120-mph (200 kph) damaged residential neighborhoods far inland.</p>
<p>"It's terrible in Raleigh. It looks like a disaster zone in every block," said Hunt before an airborne tour of the coast. "It looks like a hurricane hit every block of Raleigh."</p>
<p>State officials said the damage appeared worst at the coast, where water surged over low-lying barrier islands, filling the streets with sand, shredding ocean piers and washing some coastal homes hundreds of feet inland.</p>
<p>"Much of downtown Carolina Beach is underwater," said town councilman Rick Burroughs. Carolina Beach, along with Wrightsville Beach and Kure Beach, lie just off Wilmington.</p>
<p>The beach communities, in some cases linked to the mainland by a single bridge or causeway, were closed and under 24-hour curfew. National Guards and police patroled the streets for looters while marine patrol officers guarded surrounding waterways.</p>
<p>"We've had a lot of devastation and destruction," said Kure Beach Mayor Betty Medlin. "We have water and sewer lines that were ruptured and it's going to take some time to get them back together."</p>
<p>In Wilmington, a preliminary assessment indicated that one percent of the buildings were destroyed and 24 percent were heavily damaged, Mayor Don Betz said.</p>
<p>Fran played a hand in the presidential election campaign, forcing Republican nominee Bob Dole to cancel a flight to New Jersey for a speech, a campaign spokesman said.</p>
<p>Flash flood warnings were in effect for a large area stretching up to Pennsylvania in the north and West Virginia in the west, according to local television stations.</p>
<p>Outside Washington, large areas of the business district of historic Alexandria were evacuated late on Friday as the Potomac River rose, flooding streets with up to three feet (one metre) of water, local NBC affiliate WRC-TV reported.</p>
<p>WRC said its weather experts expected the Potomac to crest at 22 feet (6.706 metres) on Sunday at Point of Rocks, Maryland.</p>
<p>In some areas of the Carolinas, the hurricane brought as much as 15 inches (37.5 cm) of rain and forecasters warned that flooding could be the storm's most serious impact.</p>
