<p>Stocks jumped to record highs in a post-election party on Wall Street Wednesday as investors bet President Clinton and the Republican-led Congress would keep the economy growing, propelling corporate earnings higher.</p>
<p>The dollar fell. Gold also fell and oil edged higher.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average soared to its 32nd record of the year, rising 96.53 points to 6,177.71. That beat the old record of 6,094.23 set on Oct. 18.</p>
<p>Investors breathed a collective sigh of relief after voters on Tuesday preserved the split Washington lineup that has overseen steady, if unspectacular, economic growth and a shrinking federal budget deficit.</p>
<p>"It looks like a post-election shopping spree," said Marty Kearney, a trader at PTI Securities. "There were no great surprises in the election and sidelined money wanted to go to work. With a long bond yield of 6.61 percent, people are going to stocks."</p>
<p>In the bond market, the benchmark 30-year Treasury slipped 13/32, or $4.06 on a $1,000 bond, and its yield edged up to 6.62 percent from 6.59 percent on Tuesday. Bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's composite index of 500 stocks also set a record, jumping 10.45 points to 724.59. The NYSE Composite index rose 5.12 to 383.55, also a record.</p>
<p>It was the Dow's first-ever close above 6,100 and the biggest one-day point gain since March 18, when it jumped 98.63 points.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues beat declines 1,701 to 756 on heavy volume of 509 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>President Clinton, a Democrat, easily turned back Republican challenger Bob Dole on Tuesday, but the Republican Party held its small majorities in both houses of Congress, setting the stage for continuing moderation in fiscal policy.</p>
<p>"The market is happy with the fact there are no big changes. It's status quo," said Richard McCabe, chief technical analyst at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>As for the near term, McCabe said, "We may get to 6,200 or 6,300 and then people will take a look."</p>
<p>"My concern is we may be in a later stage or mature stage of the bull market," he said. "If the market stalls at year-end or early next year, there could be a sizeable 20 percent pullback in 1997."</p>
<p>Analysts said the stock market was still viewed as the best place for investors to place their money.</p>
<p>"We go back to last year's argument that there's no alternative to stocks with yields this low," said Richard Cripps, chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker.</p>
<p>In currency markets, the dollar fell against the Japanese yen and German mark as traders booked profits after election results came in as had been expected in financial markets.</p>
<p>The dollar fell to 113.95 yen and 1.5175 marks late in New York, down from 114.25 yen and 1.5200 marks late on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, December crude oil rose 5 cents to $22.69 a barrel at the New York Mercantile Exchange. December gold closed down 90 cents at $378.70 an ounce on New York's Commodity Exchange.</p>
<p>Overseas, London's FTSE 100 rose 14.6 points to 3,935.7 and Tokyo's Nikkei 225 average jumped 399.19 points, or 1.94 percent, to 20,991.52.</p>
