<p>Gold prices are unlikely to be significantly affected by Iraq's military moves against Kurdish minorities in the north of the country at the weekend, Japanese precious metal industry officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>"The gold market has reacted little to it, and is unlikely to react sharply as long as the conflict is limited locally," an official at a bullion house said.</p>
<p>Spot gold was quoted at $386.60/7.10 per ounce at 0441 GMT, against $386.50/387.00 in New York on Friday.</p>
<p>The officials said, however, that gold prices could rise if inflationary fears increase in line with oil price rises.</p>
<p>Crude oil prices jumped in early Asian trade on Monday in reaction to news the United Nations would put off plans to implement an oil-for-food deal with Iraq.</p>
<p>Yen-based Tokyo gold futures on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) rose slightly, purely in reaction to the yen's weakness against the dollar.</p>
<p>The benchmark August gold futures contract was up seven yen per gram at 1,344 yen at 0447 GMT.</p>
<p>"The rises in gold futures were purely reflecting the currency market, and were not because of buying in reaction to the Iraqi tensions," a trading house trader said.</p>
