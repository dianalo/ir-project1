<p>Algeria has passed on offers in a tender it launched last Sunday for the purchase of 100,000 tonnes of milling wheat, European grain traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Algeria passed on offers because they were too highly-priced," one trader said.  </p>
<p>Algeria was seeking 100,000 tonnes of French, Argentine or U.S. milling wheat, or any combination of the three, for shipment in February and March.</p>
<p>Last week Algeria bought 50,000 tonnes of French wheat for January shipment at $172.50 per tonne, including freight and the cost of a Coface export credit, traders said.</p>
