<p>Indian Foreign Minister Inder Gujral will attend the first ministerial meeting of the Indian Ocean littoral states in Mauritius this week, a Foreign Ministry official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The foreign minister is leaving on Wednesday to participate in the 14-nation forum," he said.</p>
<p>The forum, to be called the Indian Ocean Rim Association for Regional Cooperation (IORARC), includes Australia, Indonesia, India, Kenya, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritius, Mozambique, Oman, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Tanzania and Yemen.</p>
<p>The three-day meeting of foreign ministers from Wednesday will adopt a draft charter of the forum at Port Louis.</p>
<p>"The forum has tremendous potential and India certainly stands to gain a lot by associating with it," the Indian official said.</p>
<p>"India's bilateral trade with IORARC countries was $7.3 billion in 1995/96 (April-March), accounting for around 10 percent of its global trade and it is showing an increasing trend," an Indian Foreign Ministry document said.</p>
<p>"Look at the kind of economic power houses that are the members of the forum...I think it is a case of let the bat do the talking," the official said.</p>
<p>The member countries account for nearly 64 percent of the global trade flows of $1.0 trillion and also have a substantial degree of intra-trade and investment, the document said.</p>
<p>"The Indian Ocean rim constitutes between a quarter and a third of world's population -- close to two billion -- carries half of world's container ships, one-third of bulk cargo traffic and two-thirds of world's oil shipments," the document said.</p>
<p>"The intra-trade among the Indian Ocean rim countries is over 20 percent of their global trade," the document said.</p>
