<headline>Bond funds could be hurt by tax cuts.</headline>

<p>Bond fund investors have had a tough year. In fact, the average long-term bond fund posted a total return of minus 1.49 percent during the eight months through July of this year.</p>
<p>But some bond fund managers are saying that things could be worse -- especially if the tax cutters have their way.</p>
<p>"Tax cuts would balloon the budget and stimulate the economy, causing inflation," said John Burgess, portfolio manager with Bankers Trust Global Investment Management. "That would cause bond yields to increase."</p>
<p>Such concerns have escalated in recent months. Bob Dole's announcement that he wants to cut taxes by 15 percent is one factor. Another is his choice of old-fashioned supply-sider Jack Kemp for running mate. Kemp has long supported the use of tax cuts to generate economic growth, which in theory will boost tax revenues and pay for the original tax cuts.</p>
<p>Some fund managers worry that things won't work out that way. Ideally, they would like to see continued slow economic growth and low inflation.</p>
<p>The reason is that when inflation rises, the fixed interest payments that bonds make to investors lose some of their purchasing power over time.</p>
<p>Tax cuts might simply boost the deficit, forcing the Treasury to issue more bonds to fill the gap between government spending and revenues.</p>
<p>One possible result is higher interest rates and inflation -- the twin devils of the bond market.</p>
<p>What's more, Clinton may come up with his own tax cut plan to bolster his election prospects. That way, both candidates would be committed to tax cuts that would frighten the bond market.</p>
<p>Ironically, such fears are surfacing at a time when long-term investors are beginning to look forward to the next recession.</p>
<p>A sharp slowdown in the economy would likely cause inflation and interest rates to fall sharply, and such a slowdown could occur during the next year or two. The average economic expansion since World War Two has lasted around four years, and the current one is already more than five years old.</p>
<p>A recession might cause interest rates to fall, pushing bond prices higher.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, though, investors could be forced to weather continued volatility in the bond market.</p>
<p>Investors who already have endured losses in their bond funds this year may want to reduce the risk in their fixed-income funds now. The best approach would be to diversify your bond fund holdings to protect them from the worst losses that will occur if interest rates move sharply higher.</p>
<p>For example, you might divide your money among funds that invest in long-term bonds with average maturities of 10 years or longer; funds that hold intermediate-term bonds (three to 10 years) and funds that hold short-term bonds (less than three years).</p>
<p>Such a portfolio would deliver higher yields than one that consists entirely of short-term bonds. For example, you might earn a current yield of around 7.8 percent, versus 7.3 percent in a short-term fund. Moreover, the diversified portfolio would suffer smaller losses than a long-term portfolio in a bond market decline.</p>
<p>Finding the right funds to construct such a portfolio is relatively simple. Studies have found that most performance differences among funds with similar maturities and credit quality can be explained by their expenses. Thus, you should choose funds with low expense ratios -- say 0.75 percent of assets or less.</p>
<p>For example, among short-term funds you could choose:</p>
<p>Payden &amp; Rygel Short Bond (800-572-9336; $5,000 minimum investment; no-load; 5.9 percent current yield), which invests in Treasurys, and high-quality mortgage and corporate notes.</p>
<p>Harbour Bond (800-422-1050; $2,000 minimum; no-load; 6.9 percent current yield) is a solid entry that holds intermediate-term domestic and foreign issues of governments and corporations as well as mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>Loomis Sayles Bond (800-633-3330; $2,500 minimum; no-load; 8 percent current yield) is a good long-term fund. It invests in investment-grade debts, securities rated below BBB and foreign issues.</p>
