<p>Israeli shares closed lower on Tuesday in what traders described as a technical correction following a rise of 12 percent since the beginning of the year, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares fell 0.48 percent, or 1.12 points, to 233.80 on all-share turnover of 172 million shekels against 216 million shekels on Monday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index closed 0.54 percent lower at 241.61.</p>
<p>"Today's decline is part of a technical correction, which is nothing unusual. Investors started taking profits towards the end of Monday's trading day and continued today," said one trader.</p>
<p>"The correction is a healthy step needed before the market can resume its rise. The most active players continue to be mutual funds which specialise in stocks," he said.</p>
<p>Traders noted that the market was indifferent to the release of December's CPI due on Wednesday, saying that investors expect a moderate rise of 0.5-0.7 percent.</p>
<p>"We were all expecting this correction. The decline was very moderate and many investors used the opportunity to buy," said Ron Weisberg at I.B.I Investment House.</p>
<p>Koor Industries, the most active share, rose 0.5 percent to 31,547 agorot on high volume of 16.8 million shekels. A Koor source said on Tuesday that the company intends to sell its 24.5 percent stake in Israel Edible Products, a food maker, to the U.S. company CPC International.</p>
<p>Industrial Buildings, the second active share, surged 4.0 percent to 442 on turnover of 7.0 million shekels. Traders said there was no evident reason for the rise.</p>
<p>Leumi Insurance Holdings rose 1.5 percent to 230 on volume of 6.3 million shekels.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.26 shekels)</p>
