<p>Panama's Stock Exchange will have a electronic clearing system by the end of the year, Stock Exchange President Roberto Brenes said.</p>
<p>The computerized system, called The Panamanian Clearing and Settlement, Inc (Panaclear), will make transactions more accurate and safer, Brenes said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Financing was provided from the Inter-American Development Bank through a $2.9 million program to automate stock exchanges throughout Central America, he said.</p>
<p>"The goal is to automate the stock exchange and have a link with other clearing systems like Euroclear. It will also give increased participation to smaller and intermediate clients that participate on the stock exchange," Brenes said.</p>
