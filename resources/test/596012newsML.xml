<p>Australian stocks ended lower on Monday with a downbeat bank sector overpowering a bullish batch of mining shares.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index lost 7.1 points or 0.3 percent to 2,531.0, outperforming its Dow counterpart in the United States which shed nearly two percent after fears about higher U.S. interest rate spooked traders.</p>
<p>"The industrials were generally weaker and the miners quite strong," said one senior dealer at a Sydney broker, summing up a day's action that many said was predictable given the leads available.</p>
<p>"The banks were hit partly because of their results and partly because the Dow was down - you wouldn't have expected anything else," he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the day's focus was on the impressive listing of insurance and banking group Colonial Ltd.</p>
<p>Colonial shares began at A$3.31 (US$2.55) and also closed at that price. This compared with an institutional price of A$3.10 and a retail price of A$2.60. Volume was heavy with 32.3 million shares or about 5.6 percent of its issued capital traded. The closing price valued the group at A$1.91 billion.</p>
<p>"There was a lot of trade and some who were there were happy to take profits," said a dealer at one investment bank.</p>
<p>The squeeze on domestic margins confirmed by Westpac Banking Corp and National Australia Bank in their first half results last week saw sellers savage the big four banks yet again. The bank index fell more than two percent.</p>
<p>ANZ Bank was worst hit, dropping 3.8 percent to A$8.017, while Commonwealth Bank lost 36.1 cents to A$13.759. Sector leader National Australia Bank lost 25 cents to A$17.70, while Westpac dropped 13 cents to A$7.11.</p>
<p>The mining sector was buoyant, with the All Resources index adding 1.2 percent and limiting any broader Dow-inspired losses.</p>
<p>Among the key miners, bellwether and copper major BHP added 34.1 cents to A$19.03, CRA jumped 2.2 percent to A$20.85, while gold/nickel miner WMC added 2.2 percent to A$8.24.</p>
<p>Outside the top rung, zinc player Pasminco and gold and base metals miner North both added 2.6 percent to A$2.73 and A$4.77 respectively.</p>
<p>In corporate news, food ingredients group Burns Philp featured after it announced a restructuring. Its shares added six percent to A$1.96 from Friday's eight month low of A$1.85. Traders said the sale of the low yielding spice and consumer food divisions and the retirement of managing director Ian Clack were positives for the group.</p>
<p>Falls outnumbered rises by a ratio of about eight to five, while about 31 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
