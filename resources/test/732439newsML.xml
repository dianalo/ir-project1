<p>Linda Stern is on vacation. She left behind this previously published column, which proved very popular with readers. She will return July 23 with a new column.</p>
<p>By Linda Stern</p>
<p>If you are the sort of person who shops at three different grocery stores because milk is cheaper here and potatoes cheaper there, don't bother to read this column. It's about saving time, not money.</p>
<p>Our financial lives are more complicated than ever. We are turning into a nation of investors, managing our own retirement accounts, carrying credit cards for clothes, gasoline, airline discounts and a host of long distance companies. We are worldly about which bank offers the cheapest checking account, which money fund ekes out the highest interest rate and how often we ought to refinance our homes for maximum deductions and minimum payments. But we are exhausted, and in countless surveys we tell the pollsters that we'd happily trade a few bucks for a few hours here or there.</p>
<p>Especially during the summer, when our minds may be on swimming pools instead of pooled investments, it's nice to give yourself this permission: You don't always have to get the best deal. Simplification is worth something, even if it's just a slight reprieve from financial hassles.</p>
<p>-- Transfer all of your bank accounts to the bank nearest your home (or office) with the most convenient hours. Ask for a consolidated statement. If your accounts total more than $100,000, don't simplify quite this much; you could jeopardise your FDIC insurance coverage.</p>
<p>-- Find out how much you can do through direct payroll deductions. You can usually pay your health insurance, buy U.S. savings bonds, donate to charity and more before you even see the check.</p>
<p>-- Alternatively, arrange to have your paycheck deposited directly into your checking account. Then, authorise as many direct payments as possible. You can pay your mortgage and utility bills, invest for college and retirement, and give all year long without ever writing or mailing a check. This is sometimes daunting to get started, but boy, does it work!</p>
<p>When your savings are automatically deducted from your checking account, you always find you can afford them, and they build up fast.</p>
<p>-- Pick your two favourite charities -- one national and one local -- and promise yourself you'll ignore all others.</p>
<p>-- Return all junk mail return mailers with the statement "Please remove me from your mailing list" written across it. Sure it takes a little longer now, but there will be a payoff in the future.</p>
<p>-- Don't even think about timing your investments.  It often doesn't work anyway.  Pick a couple of very broad mutual funds that will buy stocks (and bonds, if you're interested) and invest domestically as well as internationally.  Then, invest regularly (via those regular checking account drafts), and do something else while your friends and coworkers are maniacally checking the charts.</p>
<p>-- Consolidate your IRAs. Remember when you started $1,000 here and $1,000 there?  Put them all with one fund company; in one fund or with one discount broker. Just make sure you don't mingle retirement accounts that don't mix, such as tax-deductible IRAs with those that aren't; Keoghs with IRAs, or company rollovers with personal retirement accounts.</p>
<p>--Toss most of the plastic.  With today's hefty credit lines, two cards ought to be enough for anyone.  So what if you got 10 percent off of your last suit by opening one charge, 500 frequent flyer miles for another.  Cancel them and stop all the accounting. Find one no-fee card for everything, and pay it off every month.</p>
<p>-- Hire help. It doesn't take a huge investment to hire somebody to pay your bills or, once and for all, file all of your paperwork. Contact the American Association of Daily Money Managers in Silver Spring, Md., at 301-593-5462 to find out how to hire this sort of assistance.</p>
