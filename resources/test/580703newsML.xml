<p>IPE gas oil futures were called to open between 25 cents and $1.00 a tonne higher on Tuesday, while Brent was expected to open around 5 cents higher after sharp gains on Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>June gas oil closed $6.25 higher on Monday at $173.50 a tonne, while June Brent climbed 77 cents to $19.70, having touched a high of $19.89, a level not beaten since March 26.  </p>
<p>Dealers said gains were made on a mix of strong investment fund interest and mildly bullish fundamental factors.</p>
<p>These included weekend news of Iranian wargames in the Gulf, talk of thinner North Sea loading programmes and a fishermen's blockade of the Sullom Voe Brent export terminal.</p>
<p>"It was more fund buying than anything else and we broke out of the new trading range...but now we're looking for some stronger fundamental news from the APIs for confirmation," a broker said.</p>
<p>Weekly U.S. stocks data from the American Petroleum Institute are expected to be released after the close of business on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We're looking to see if gasoline demand is at the same level," a broker said.</p>
<p>Last week's APIs implied record gasoline demand levels, but some market-watchers were sceptical about the validity of the figures.</p>
<p>The next key resistance level for Brent is $20.00, brokers said.</p>
