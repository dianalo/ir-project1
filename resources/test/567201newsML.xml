<p>Share in Cobham Plc advanced on Wednesday after the UK engineering group gave a generally upbeat investor presentation, dealers said.</p>
<p>At 1327 GMT, the shares were up 14p to 645-1/2p as the engineering sector, bucking the trend of the broader market, was steady to weaker.</p>
<p>The company was not immediately available to comment, but dealers said about 40 institutions and brokers attended the presentation.</p>
<p>"The word is that it went well and we're seeing a few buyers as a result" a dealer said. But he noted that volume was not heavy, with only 657,000 shares registered at 1327 GMT.</p>
<p>The stock rose sharply in April, scoring a record high at 671p on April 17, before falling back during the latter part of the month.</p>
