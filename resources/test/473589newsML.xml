<p>Asian crude prices were weaker on Friday as Minas crude finally traded after several days of inactivity.</p>
<p>Traders said a U.S. producer paid between ICP -10/15 cents for 150,000 barrels of Minas from a shosha. The deal was in line with recent deals.</p>
<p>Most regional grades were quiet, although a producer managed to sell a long-offered cargo of 450,000 barrels of Liuhua crude oil. The price and buyer were kept confidential, market sources said.</p>
<p>An April Attaka and Belida cargo remained on offer.  </p>
<p>The cargos became available in a second allocation by Pertamina, traders said. The Belida was said offered at ICP +30/40 cents, finding little support despite a Belida sold last week at +50 cents.</p>
<p>Dubai crude held onto a small backwardation, despite the weakness of Brent. Brent May/June was assessed at -9/-6 cents per barrel, but Dubai held a +7/+15 market.</p>
<p>The backwardation was supported by expectations of India buying Dubai in its May crude. The tender should be awarded later on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Traders said offers ranged first half May quotes +10 to +21 cents, but India's appetite for Dubai could once again be limited because of its term deal to buy Iraqi crude oil.</p>
<p>Bangchak was also expected to award its May tender later on Thursday. It has received about four offers of Oman and the award was expected by one offerer between MPM flat to -4 cents.</p>
<p>Several light sweet grades were offered, including Australian grades, market sources said.</p>
<p>Oman spot crude traded at MPM -5 cents between U.S. majors and a partial was traded at MPM -2.5 cents between traders.</p>
