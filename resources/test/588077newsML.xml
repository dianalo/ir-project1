<p>Santos Ltd said on Thursday the acquisition of WMC Ltd's East Spar oil and gas interests offshore Western Australia is expected to slightly enhance expected earnings in 1997.</p>
<p>However, Santos chairman John Uhrig said the expansion of capital due to the recently announced rights issue was expected to have a modestly dilutive effect on earnings per share in 1997.  </p>
<p>"The company has before a range of growth projects and opportunities, many of which will contribute to sales and earnings in 1998," Uhrig told the meeting.</p>
<p>He said that prior to the acquisiton of the East Spar interests the company had expected production volumes in 1997 would be similar to 1996 levels and that operating profit after tax would be comparable to the 1996 result of A$195.9 million.</p>
<p>"The acquisiton of the East Spar intersts is epxected to slighly enhance earnings in 1997," he said.  </p>
<p>Santos announced in March that it would pay A$181 million for WMC's 30 percent holding in the East Spar oil and gas field funded by a one-for-eight rights issue at A$4.00 per share, raising about A$270 million.</p>
<p>Santos shares were six cents firmer at A$5.58 at 11.45 a.m. (0145 GMT).</p>
