<p>Police in Italy said they had arrested 17 people on Thursday on suspicion of supplying arms and other support to Algeria's radical Armed Islamic Group (GIA).</p>
<p>The arrests followed raids in at least eight cities in Italy on some 60 homes and meeting places of North African immigrants including an Islamic centre in Milan and a mosque in the northwest city of Turin, senior officers told a news conference.</p>
<p>The Imam at the mosque, Moustafa Aboussaad, said the site had been searched "with maximum respect" for its sacred nature and told reporters the community had no links with extremism.</p>
<p>"No one who works here or comes here regularly has been arrested or is under investigation," the cleric said.</p>
<p>The operation, codenamed Shabka, Arabic for net, was coordinated in Turin and involved some 300 officers following a year of surveillance and telephone taps.</p>
<p>The GIA, fighting to establish a purist fundamentalist state in Algeria, is blamed for killing civilians, including women activists, writers, journalists and religious workers in a five-year-old conflict with the Algerian government.</p>
<p>It is also blamed for taking Algerian civil strife into French streets where eight people were killed and around 170 injured by bombs between July and October last year in Paris and the central city of Lyon.</p>
<p>Several suspected supporters were arrested in Italy last year in a similar operation to Thursday's.</p>
<p>Police said the people held in the latest raids were suspected of supplying arms and false documents to the GIA as well as smuggling activists into Europe.</p>
<p>The arrest warrant, quoted by the Italian news agency ANSA, said the suspects were believed to belong to a "criminal association of the GIA active in several regions of Italy in direct operational contact with similar groups operating in other European states and in Algeria".</p>
<p>More than 50,000 people have died in Algeria's violence since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a huge lead.</p>
