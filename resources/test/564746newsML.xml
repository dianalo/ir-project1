<p>Hong Kong stocks continued their powerful rally on Tuesday, with the blue chip Hang Seng Index surging more than 200 points in morning trade after the Dow industrials hit a record high on Monday, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index was up 242.75 points, or 1.81 percent, at 13,642.09 after jumping to an early high of 13,679.92.</p>
<p>Turnover was HK$1.67 billion after the first 20 minutes of trade.</p>
<p>"The New York market went up so high. We are already up 200 points. There is a possibility that Hong Kong will go even further because this is unexpected," said Sean Li, associate director at Amsteel Securities.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials rose 143.29 points, or 2.03 percent, on Monday to an all-time closing high of 7,214.49, buoyed by mounting expectations of a capital gains tax cut in the United States and hopes that inflation remains in check.</p>
<p>While Li said the index may try for 13,800 points on Tuesday, Seapower Securities senior research manager Sunny Chan said the rally should begin to slow above 13,600 points.</p>
<p>"I think 13,600 points should be strong resistance. Judging from the turnover, we may be able to test 14,000 points in the coming weeks but the problem is Hong Kong's market fundamentals have not changed a lot. It is purely liquidity driven," he said.</p>
<p>Chan said investors may be too optimistic about their hopes for a recovery in the property market after a recent slump. "The property stocks are just staging a technical rebound," he said.</p>
<p>"It is likely that the market will stay at current levels and I think at this level people should take profit," said Chan.</p>
<p>HSBC Holdings Plc continued to reach records, with the stock surging HK$5.00 to an all-time high of HK$207.00.</p>
<p>Shares in jewellery maker and retailer Luk Fook Holdings (International) Ltd debuted at HK$1.40 per share compared with an initial public offering price of HK$1.00 but later retreated to trade at HK$1.25.</p>
<p>Sun Fook Kong Holdings Ltd jumped HK$0.60 to HK$2.10.</p>
<p>China Travel International Investment Hong Kong Ltd said it was negotiating the acquisition of a stake in the company. China Travel rose HK$0.10 to HK$4.20.</p>
