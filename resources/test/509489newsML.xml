<p>Wells Fargo and Co's shares tumbled after the bank, which bought First Interstate Bancorp in 1996, posted disappointing first-quarter results on Tuesday, causing analysts to slash forecasts for the year.</p>
<p>"The revenue picture is rather slugglish," said Thomas Theurkauf, an analyst with Keefe Bruyette Woods. "When you strip out securities gains and more volatile items, you find a modest compression in revenues and that's a disappointment."</p>
<p>The stock fell 8-1/4 to 256-1/2 after Wells reported first-quarter earnings fell to $3.62 a share from $5.39.  </p>
<p>Earlier, Paul Hazen, Wells Fargo's chief executive, said while the bank was halfway to its goal of $800 million in gross annual expense reductions, revenues were held back by declines in its loan and deposit portfolios.</p>
<p>Analysts said the bank's revenue was affected by some customer attrition that followed the merger.</p>
<p>"It points out how difficult it is for a company to simultaneously strip expenses and grow revenue base (after a merger). You've got to figure there will be some customer attrition," Theurkauf said, noting he was lowering his forecast for the year, currently at $16.50 a share.</p>
