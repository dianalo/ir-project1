<p>U.N. police monitors said on Friday they were trying to secure the release of a former Bosnian Croat militia officer who was arrested by Serb police during a routine traffic check.</p>
<p>Ivo Mijacevic, who led a Croat brigade during the Bosnian war, was arrested as he drove through Serb-controlled territory on Thursday on a main road linking northern Bosnia to neighbouring Croatia, U.N. spokesman Alex Ivanko said.</p>
<p>Ivanko called the arrest a "disturbing incident"  and a clear violation of the right to free movement under terms of a Bosnia peace agreement.</p>
<p>"We are pressing Serb authorities as we speak to release this gentleman," Ivanko told Reuters.</p>
<p>Serb authorities in the town of Modrica had charged Mijacevic with shelling a Serb house during the war, U.N. police monitors reported.</p>
<p>The arrest comes amid growing concern among international officials over dubious legal proceedings in Bosnia.</p>
<p>Human rights worker say nationalist authorities have flouted international legal standards set out under the peace agreement, often under the guise of "war crimes trials" against ethnic rivals.</p>
<p>A Serb court in Zvornik recently sentenced three Moslem men to 20 years in prison on murder charges after denying them the right to choose their own defence lawyers.</p>
<p>Bosnian Moslem-Croat federation authorities have yet to review the case of a Serb soldier convicted of murder during the war. His defence lawyer has discovered that two of the alleged murder victims are alive and well.</p>
<p>Bosnian authorities this week detained an opposition politician during a session of the federation parliament.</p>
<p>Ibrahim Djedovic, who helped lead an armed rebellion against the Bosnian government during the Yugoslav conflict, was taken to a Sarajevo prison on Friday, Ivanko said.</p>
<p>Under terms of the peace treaty, Bosnian authorities have the right to conduct war crimes trials if the U.N. war crimes tribunal in the Hague decides that the case meets international legal standards.</p>
<p>Ivanko said the tribunal had told the Bosnian authorities they could go ahead with an investigation against Djedovic.</p>
<p>"The prosecutor has stated that there is sufficient evidence under international standards for national courts to proceed with a further investigation," he said.</p>
