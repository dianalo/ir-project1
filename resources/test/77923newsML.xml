<p>The Duchess of York's lawyers confirmed on Thursday that she would continue a court battle to stop a former friend from publishing intimate details about her.</p>
<p>The ex-wife of Queen Elizabeth's second son, Prince Andrew, launched her court battle six weeks ago against a book by Allan Starkie describing her relationship with her former "financial adviser" John Bryan.</p>
<p>While still married to Andrew, the duchess, known popularly as Fergie, was photographed with Bryan in the south of France. An infamous picture of Bryan sucking the toe of the topless duchess was splashed across newspapers and magazines worldwide.</p>
<p>To the anger of Starkie's publishers, a High Court judge decided at a private hearing on Wednesday to renew an injunction blocking publication of the book, entitled, "Fergie: Her Secret Life", until after a full trial, due to start on October 7.</p>
<p>Schilling &amp; Lom, lawyers for the duchess, said: "Following the inter parties ruling at the High Court yesterday in favour of the Duchess of York, we confirm the report today that the Duchess of York intends to proceed with this case to trial."</p>
<p>Under the terms of the injunction, the duchess must provide security of 500,000 pounds ($780,000) for any damages which might go against her if she loses the case.</p>
<p>The trial, expected to last 10 days, will take place in open court, making it highly likely that she will be called to give evidence in public.</p>
<p>The duchess, the former Sarah Ferguson, is writing her own life story which is due to be published later this year. Under her divorce settlement she is not allowed to describe life in the royal family.</p>
