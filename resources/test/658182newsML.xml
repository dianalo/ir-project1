<p>Tokyo yen-based aluminium futures scored solid gains on Wednesday, helped by the sharp rise in the dollar against the yen, traders said.</p>
<p>"Sentiment is improving slowly," said one trader. "The metal seems to be faring better in London as well."</p>
<p>The TOCOM benchmark April 1998 contract climbed 2.7 yen to end at 191.7 yen, while other contracts rose by 2.5 to 2.9 yen.</p>
<p>Estimated volume remained a thin 1,664 lots, up slightly from 1,144 lots on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Aluminium futures, which started higher following the strong performance overnight in London, gathered momentum in the afternoon when the dollar briefly rose more than four yen compared with late U.S. Wednesday levels to nearly 116 yen.</p>
<p>In London overnight, benchmark three-month aluminium rose by $6 to finish at $1,623 per tonne, helped by copper which rallied more than $50 to the highest levels in nearly 13 months.</p>
