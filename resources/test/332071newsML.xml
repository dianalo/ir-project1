<p>The world Red Cross body IFRC issued an urgent appeal on Friday for support for its aid programme to flood-hit North Korea, where persistent reports say tens of thousands of people are on starvation rations.</p>
<p>"The situation is critical," said a statement from the IFRC, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies which has been working in the country for two years to bring relief to some of the worst-hit areas.</p>
<p>"Without more money we cannot continue the operation and we will be forced to leave people without food or other assistance," the statement, from the Geneva-based Federation's North Korea desk chief Yasuo Tanaka said.</p>
<p>The floods, which hit many regions of the reclusive communist state in the autumn of 1995 and again last year, wrecked housing, roads, schools and farms and covered rice fields with mud and debris, destroying much of the harvest.</p>
<p>The IFRC says the disaster left half a million people homeless and without food stocks out of a total population of some 23 million.</p>
<p>With the North Korean Red Cross, the IFRC has been distributing rice and maize to some 139,000 worst hit people who it says are totally dependent on its support.</p>
<p>Last September the Federation launched an appeal among its member societies to raise 13 million Swiss francs ($9.2 million) but so far only one million ($700,000) has been raised.</p>
<p>Next week the South Korean Red Cross is due to resume food shipments to the North for the first time since tension over a North Korean submarine Seoul says landed 26 armed infiltrators in September.</p>
<p>The first delivery, the IFRC said, would be made up of 300 tonnes of wheat flour and 15,000 pairs of socks. "But more help is needed," the statement added. "We are urgently appealing for equally timely donations."</p>
