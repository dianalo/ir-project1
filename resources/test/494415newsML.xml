<p>South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo on Tuesday urged the Zairean government and rebels to reach a ceasefire agreement before looking to the country's future.</p>
<p>"First, they should cease hostilities and then look at the future towards a united and strong Zaire," Nzo, in India for a meeting of foreign ministers of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), told reporters in New Delhi.</p>
<p>Zaire has witnessed heavy fighting since civil strife broke out six months ago when rebels fighting to end President Mobutu Sese Seko's 32-year-rule launched an armed campaign.</p>
<p>International efforts to negotiate an end to the fighting showed no sign of a breakthrough after a third day of talks on Monday in South Africa between warring parties.</p>
<p>Nzo said that the Zairean issue was serious enough for people outside the country's border to be concerned. "Thousands and thousands of people have had to pack their bags. That is why it is important that an agreement must be reached," he said.</p>
<p>"We therefore have called upon the Zaire parties to take proper attention towards the question of ceasefire."</p>
<p>In South Africa, envoys from Kinshasa and those of rebel leader Laurent Kabila met through Monday with no tangible sign of any progress in the search for peace.</p>
<p>"At the moment, it is all negotiations. We have to overcome some pitfalls but we hope soon substantial discussions between the Zaire parties to take place," the South African minister said.</p>
<p>On Monday, a Zairean government army commander said the rebels were about 15 km (10 miles) from the copper and cobalt mining centre of Lubumbashi.</p>
