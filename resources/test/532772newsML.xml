<p>Bangladesh's central bank governor Lutfar Rahman Sarkar on Tuesday warned that the country's banking system was on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p>"The country's legal framework is very poor...The banks burdended with huge bad loans are facing legal problems. As a result the banking system is now on the verge of collapse," Sarkar told a meeting of bank lawyers.</p>
<p>He said Bangladesh's banking sector was burdened with  130 billion taka ($3 billion) in defaulted loans, with 50 billion alone owed by 137 individuals.</p>
<p>Sarkar blamed defaulters for the parlous state of the country's banking system.</p>
<p>He said they were taking advantage of the loopholes of law and called for strict new preventive measures, indlucing making it a criminal offense. At present is only against the civil code to default on a loan.</p>
<p>Khondker Ibrahim Khaled, managing director of state-owned Sonali Bank, the country's largest bank, said 40 percent of the loans came from private banks and less than 30 percent from the public sector banks.</p>
<p>The biggest problems were in the industrial sector, in particular in the leather industry.</p>
<p>Dhaka University professor of economics Mozaffar Ahmed said the government should immediately introduce criminal procedures as deterent against defaulting of bank loans.</p>
<p>Sohel Ahmed, managing director of Angel Fabrics, warned the problem threatened the country's reputation.</p>
<p>"The whole business community has been disgraced because of the deeds of few dishonest entrepreneurs." ($ = 43.55 Bangladesh Taka)</p>
