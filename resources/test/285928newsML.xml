<p>Sri Lanka stocks were marginally lower in early Friday trading, due to declines in two highly capitalised banking blue chips which are involved in a possible merger, brokers said.</p>
<p>The all share index was 0.76 points down at 605.97 at the mid-morning break, on turnover of 12.16 million rupees.</p>
<p>Commercial Bank and Hatton National Bank shares fell eight rupees each to 125 and 265 rupees respectively.</p>
<p>"Overall, there is buying interest. The index was dragged down mainly by falls in HNB and Commercial after yesterday's merger story," said Shanil Perera, a broker at Lanka Securities.  </p>
<p>Commercial Bank said on Thursday that Hatton National Bank (HNB) and Development Finance Corporation (DFCC) had bid for a 40 percent stake of its equity.</p>
<p>"Commercial Bank is down because a newspaper said HNB had bid only 103 rupees a share," said a broker who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>HNB was down due to a lack of buyers, who felt that DFCC had a better chance of getting the 40 percent stake, he said.</p>
