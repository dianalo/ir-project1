<p>Phoenix Network Inc said Wednesday that parties to the previously announced merger, Phoenix Network, US ONE Communications Corp and Resurgens Capital Group Inc have mutually agreed to discontinue merger negotiations and cancel the letter of intent dated June 19.</p>
<p>Phoenix said the reason for this decision is that Resurgens Capital has been notified by its investment bankers that, given present market conditions, the merged companies would be unlikely to raise sufficient long-term financing in either the public equity or debt market to finance the contemplated transaction.  </p>
<p>Phoenix said it will not pursue its previously announced merger with US ONE.</p>
<p>Phoenix said it was disappointed that the necessary financing could not be arranged and that the merger discussions had to be discontinued.</p>
<p>The company said the discussions with Resurgens and US ONE have not stopped it from considering alternative opportunities within its industry "and we will now vigorously pursue those opportunities which we feel will allow us to achieve our corporate goals and enhance our shareholders' value."</p>
<p>Phoenix said that in order to be successful it must immediately raise additional capital, consolidate with a company operating its own long distance network and continue discussions with the acquisition targets which it brought to this contemplated merger.</p>
<p>"We have recently been contacted by and are currently in negotiations with several potential equity investors," the news release said.</p>
