<p>Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) remained buoyant on Middle East voyages on Wednesday, as brokers continued to focus on a shortage of vessels until at least mid-June.</p>
<p>VLCCs to South Korea achieved up to W75, five points up from Tuesday, as evidenced by the 260,000 tonne Alexita, fixed for Hyundai and loading on June 27, while the 255,000 tonne Mosocean was done for W72.5 for Hanwha.</p>
<p>Mideast/west voyages fetched around W60 to Europe and a couple of points less to the U.S.</p>
<p>West Africa/U.S. Gulf VLCCs were steady to slightly firmer at W67.5, with 130,000 tonne (Suezmax) vessels unchanged at W95, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean 80,000 tonne (Aframax) also remained firm at W107.5 on good enquiry. "The market looks stable or likely to increase -- I am quite optimistic," said an Italian broker, noting good levels of enquiry.</p>
<p>Med 130,000 tonne vessels (Suezmaxes) were stable at W95/97.5. "There are few good quality vessels and quite a number of cargoes," the broker added.</p>
<p>But the inter-U.K./Cont 80,000 tonne market was quiet amid low enquiry. Brokers put the prevailing rate at around W110/112.5, down some five points from Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be surprised if rates came off further," a north European broker said.</p>
<p>The trans-Atlantic market was quiet, with the rate for Suezmaxes from the North Sea to the U.S. Atlantic coast remaining at around W87.5.</p>
<p>The 70,000 tonne Caribbean crude market edged up to W205 from W200 after good enquiry on Tuesday but 50,000 tonne fuel oil rates slipped to W210 from W215 in quiet trade, a U.S. broker said.</p>
