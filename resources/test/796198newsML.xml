<p>U.S. banking firm Shapiro &amp; Co acquired 40 percent of Romania's Biofarm pharmaceuticals and pledged to invest $50 million in expanding the company, the State Ownership Fund (FPS) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The contract was signed several weeks ago and Shapiro will pay for the whole stake in about 40 days after the signing," FPS president Sorin Dimitriu told a news conference.</p>
<p>The selling price remained confidential but Dimitriu said the FPS had got 30 percent more than it had bargained for.</p>
<p>Biofarm, which holds a share of about 25 percent of the local market for pharmaceuticals, has a capital of nine billion lei. The FPS was a 40 percent shareholder, with the remaining 60 percent held by Romanian individuals who bought shares with vouchers in a mass selloff.</p>
<p>Shapiro's investment package for Biofarm starts this month, Dimitriu said.</p>
<p>"Shapiro will invest in boosting capacity and in bringing Romanian pharmaceuticals in line with European standards so that exports will be possible," Shapiro lawyer David Ben Yehuda Costa told reporters.</p>
<p>It will also invest in environmental protection.</p>
<p>Shapiro, based in Carson City, Nevada, has shares in chemical and petrochemical companies in Italy, Switzerland and the United States, a company statement said. No further information on Shapiro was immediately available.</p>
<p>The company was planning to make other strategic investments in Romania's chemical and petrochemical sectors.</p>
<p>Biofarm trades on Romania's over-the-counter market and its shareholders' meeting had agreed to move it on to the Bucharest bourse prior to the sale to Shapiro.</p>
<p>"For the time being, we are not interested in taking the company to the stock exchange. It will continue to trade on the OTC market," Costa said. ($=7,433 lei)</p>
