<title>USA: Fewer ex-corporate managers starting own companies.</title>
<headline>Fewer ex-corporate managers starting own companies.</headline>

<p>The number of former corporate executives and managers opting to start their own businesses fell to a record low in the first quarter, a major outplacement firm said Monday, and instead sought the security of a salaried job.</p>
<p>Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas Inc. said the strong jobs market was offering greater financial stability and security than entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>"While companies continue to downsize in an effort to become more competitive, many simultaneously seek skilled employees to enhance the most profitable areas of the company," said John Challenger, executive vice president of the Chicago-based firm.</p>
<p>"Now that jobs are going begging in many industries, the vast majority of job seekers look at becoming an entrepreneur and ask, 'Why gamble?' Instead, they choose to pursue the relative security of a salaried job with a benefits package," he added.</p>
<p>The firm said it tracked individuals going through its outplacement programme and found that those choosing to start their own businesses fell by 60 percent in the past year, from 12.9 percent in the second quarter of 1996 to a record low 5.1 percent in the first quarter or this year.</p>
<p>The average for the past four quarters was 9 percent, it said. That was still down significantly from the one in five job seekers who opted for entrepreneurship in 1989, a period of widespread corporate restructuring and job losses.</p>
<p>Challenger said about 3,000 individuals go through its programme annually, though the number varies in any given quarter. "We don't publish the size of our business -- but these figures give a good handle on what's happening out there in the workplace," he added.</p>
<p>"In the past six months, I have interviewed more people who were self-employed and now want to return to a company job," Kim Oliver, of Buck Consultants Inc., a New York City benefits consulting company, told Challenger, Grey.</p>
<p>Challenger said some job searchers who choose entrepreneurship rather than another job have likely experienced losing a previous job more than once. While they "may not be true risk-takers, they are more willing to endure the ups and downs of entrepreneurship rather than the trauma of another job cut," he said.</p>
<p>But he said others with just as good or better entrepreneurial skills, who would likely succeed on their own, "are among the most sought-after job candidates.</p>
<p>"Their entrepreneurial mindset involves many of the qualities companies are looking for in employees, including a keen understanding of the marketplace and the flexibility to tackle many different tasks."</p>
