<p>Britain's world land speed record challenger, the jet powered Thrust SSC car, set off for speed trials in the Jordanian desert on Friday as the race with a rival American team began to hot up.</p>
<p>The men behind the Thrust car, designer Richard Noble and driver Andy Green, don't see much difficulty in breaking the record of 633.47 mph (1,019.44 kph) Noble himself set in 1983.</p>
<p>The ultimate target is to take Thrust SSC, which looks more like a jet fighter without wings than a car, beyond the sound barrier for the first time on land to speeds of more than 750 mph (1,207 kph).</p>
<p>"The key thing is to go supersonic," Noble said as the Thrust car was loaded onto a giant Russian Antonov freighter for the flight to Jordan, where the team will be testing on a 10- mile (16 km) stretch of the Al Jafr desert.</p>
<p>"We'll be breaking the speed record on almost a daily basis," said Green, a 34-year-old Royal Air Force Tornado fighter pilot.</p>
<p>The British team are competing with American Craig Breedlove and his car, the Spirit of America, which has been prevented from making a record attempt by early rains in the Black Rock desert in Nevada.</p>
<p>Breedlove, with five records under his belt, took the world record in 1965 with a speed of 600 mph (965.6 kph).</p>
<p>Noble describes Thrust, a brutal-looking construction of aluminium and carbon fibre powered by two massive engines from a Phantom warplane, as the most powerful car in the world.</p>
<p>Its engines put out 110,000 horsepower, equivalent to 141 Formula One racing cars or a large warship. It should take about 8.5 seconds to run it up to supersonic speed and bring it to a halt with its twin parachutes.</p>
<p>Green has tested the car up to 200 mph (321.9 kph) along the runway at Farnborough airfield near London. A tyre burst during an early test, but he now pronounces himself entirely satisfied with the car.</p>
<p>"It's very predictable, very stable," Green told reporters. The car has been incredibly well behaved. The problem has been keeping it down to 200 mph (321.9 km).</p>
<p>"Now we need to take it to the desert and work it up to some serious speeds."</p>
<p>The Thrust team preferred the Jordanian desert, where scenes from Lawrence of Arabia were filmed, to America because the weather is drier.</p>
<p>But if they do not expect any difficulty in getting the car up to speed, they don't have enough space to stop it, which means that supersonic speeds will have to wait until America next year.</p>
<p>After the measured mile over which the record will be set, the car has 4.5 miles to come to a halt -- not enough if it breaks the sound barrier.</p>
<p>Thrust has taken two-and-a-half years to research and another 75,000 man-hours to build. Noble will not say what will happen to the car if it smashes through the sound barrier, but the team is confident there will be no surprises.</p>
<p>"It's not unknown territory. It's unproven territory," said Green. "It's very much like a test pilot's job."</p>
