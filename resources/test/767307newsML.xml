<p>IMPACT OF TODAY'S OFFICIAL INTEREST RATE CUT</p>
<p>Shadow Treasurer Gareth Evans has applauded the latest rate cut by the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>Official rates have been cut by half of one percent to five percent, the lowest since 1994.</p>
<p>Mr Evans insists this is only the beginning, and said that the obligation is now on the Government to capitalise and consolidate on that cut.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, home loan interest rates have begun falling.</p>
<p>Among the first to respond were Mortgage originators, RAMS and Aussie Home Loans which have quickly moved to pass on the full 0.5 of a percent cut to customers.</p>
<p>Changes announced by banks so far only effect no-frills loans.</p>
<p>Westpac has passed on the full rate cut to its first option home loans, the Commonwealth's economiser rate has fallen by a smaller 0.35 of a percent.</p>
<p>Real Estate Institute of Australia President, Don Brindley, said the cut, if fully passed on, should encourage those people still hesitant about getting into the marketplace.</p>
<p>"Certainly it will add to the affordability of housing, and it will especially be of benefit to encouraging first home buyers into the market, and hopefully it will show some benefit in the longer run to employment growth," he said.</p>
<p>Senior economist with Rothschilds, Nikki Hutley, said the cut will not make a big difference to the growth of the economy, which she said was already set to grow strongly in the coming year.</p>
<p>"I really think this last one is very much, almost irrelevent really, I think it's almost more just to calm people's nerves rather than to have a significant impact on the growth outlook," she said.</p>
<p>She said she believes that the economy would reach four per cent growth next year with or without another cut.</p>
<p>In the past year official rates have been cut by 2.5 percent</p>
<p>And the Australian dollar has regained ground, after falling nearly half a cent against the greenback on news of the rate cut.</p>
<p>The currency dropped to 74 US cents on the announcement, before buying started.</p>
<p>It is now trading at around 74.64 U.S. cents, up 0.08 of a cent on this morning's local opening.</p>

<p>CHAMBER SAYS INTEREST RATE CUT TO IMPROVE BUSINESS CONFIDENCE</p>
<p>The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says today's cut in official interest rates will help improve business confidence and economic growth.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank this morning announced it had cut official rates by half a per cent, the fifth cut in a year.</p>
<p>The announcement had been widely expected by market analysts, after last week's low inflation and wages figures, and continuing high unemployment.</p>
<p>ACCI chief economist, Stephen Kates, said the important thing now is for interest rates to stay down.</p>
<p>"It would be just a tragic mistake if the Reserve Bank were to bring rates down and then find they had to raise them sooner than they otherwise would have," he said.</p>
<p>"The important point about having cut rates is that they are determined to keep rates down and that they are determined to see faster rates of economic growth".</p>

<p>PM'S HEALTH IMPROVES</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's office says Mr Howard's health is improving, however he's likely to miss another Cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>Mr Howard, who's been suffering from pneumonia, is expected to remain in hospital for most of this week.</p>
<p>A spokesman says Mr Howard is a lot better today, but he's not expected back at work for several days.</p>
<p>The spokesman says it's likely doctors will order Mr Howard to rest next week, so the Prime Minister is expected to miss the Cabinet meeting on unemployment.</p>

<p>CALL FOR PUBLIC HELP IN WHELAN DISAPPEARANCE CASE</p>
<p>A senior investigator in the police task force investigating the disappearance of Sydney woman Kerrie Whelan today called for public help in the search for a vehicle.</p>
<p>The vehicle being sought is a 1989 silver-blue Suzuki Vitara four wheel drive.</p>
<p>Detective Denis Bray made the appeal today on behalf of Taskforce Belair, outside Goulburn courthouse.</p>
<p>Minutes earlier inside the court, southern highlands grazier Bruce Allan Burrell was committed for trial for allegedly receiving a number of stolen vehicles.</p>
<p>They included a 1989 silver-blue Suzuki Vitara.</p>
<p>Detective Bray said the vehicle was last seen in the Goulburn district around December last year.</p>
<p>"Although it is believed it may have been seen later than that time, the vehicle is of interest to investigators and police are appealing to anyone who may have seen the vehicle or who has had possession of the vehicle to contact crimestoppers," he said.</p>

<p>AUSTRALIANS WAITING LONGER TO GET MARRIED</p>
<p>Australians are waiting longer to get married, and are choosing to take the step less often.</p>
<p>The latest figures show the number of marriages registered last year has fallen by eight per cent from 1986.</p>
<p>First marriage rates have declined, as have most re-marriage rates.</p>
<p>The median age for a first marriage has risen, with those choosing to tie the knot four years older than their counterparts in 1974.</p>
<p>While the number of marriages is falling, divorce rates and the median age for divorce have gone up.</p>
<p>More than eight million Australians are married, and more than 900,000 are divorced.</p>

<p>FISCHER REJECTS CALLS TO REPLACE ANDERSON</p>
<p>The Deputy Prime Minister and Federal National Party leader, Tim Fischer, has flatly rejected calls to replace the Primary Industries Minister, John Anderson.</p>
<p>Mr Fischer has strongly defended Mr Anderson, saying the Minister fully understands the circumstances in rural Australia. Queensland graingrowers have passed a motion of no confidence in Mr Anderson and have called for him to be replaced.</p>
<p>Speaking on ABC Radio, Mr Fischer has criticised the graingrowers action.</p>
<p>"It's unrealistic, it's unfair after just 16 months of trying to turn around the mess we were left with by Labor and it's shooting themselves in the feet," Mr Fischer said.</p>
<p>"But I accept that there is an element and a vendetta coming out of elements in Queensland. We will just get on with the task and our very best answer is the half a per cent interest rate cut," he said.</p>

<p>SUPERMARKET WAREHOUSE WORKERS OUT OVER REDUNDANCIES</p>
<p>The Franklins Supermarket chain says it's considering its options on how to deal with more than 600 workers at its Sydney warehouses who've refused a direction to go back to work.</p>
<p>Workers at Ingleburn and Chullora warehouses are protesting against 230 positions at Chullora being made redundant.</p>
<p>National Union of Workers members voted this morning to reject a New South Wales Industrial Commission direction to return to work.</p>
<p>One of the options open to Franklins after the vote is the instant dismissal of workers.</p>
<p>A Franklins spokesman says there's a "very generous" package available to those facing redundancy.</p>
