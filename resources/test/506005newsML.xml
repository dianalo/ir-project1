<p>The former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan is holding a tender worth $100 million to refit the country's large Muruntau gold mine, a senior Uzbek mining official said on Monday.</p>
<p>Yevgenny Tolstov, chief engineer at the Navoi Metallurgical Combine, told Reuters that the tender was aimed at raising cash to modernise conveyor equipment to increase ore processing capacity from 37 million cubic metres in 1996 to 40-45 million cubic metres.</p>
<p>He said the tender result would be known by July and that seven companies, including unspecified ones from Germany and Japan, were among the bidders. He gave no further details.</p>
<p>Navoi, located in the Kyzylkum desert, accounts for about 90 percent of the Central Asian state's gold output, with 55 tonnes of the metal produced each year.</p>
