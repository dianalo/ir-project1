<p>Thousands of people marched through the French port of Brest on Thursday to denounce planned job cuts at navy shipyards under a sweeping reform of the defence and arms industry.</p>
<p>Police said 12,000 people took part in the rally called by groups ranging from unions to Catholic associations. Organisers said 20,000 people demonstrated in the third such protest since July in the western port.</p>
<p>"We refuse to accept a catastrophe like the steel industry in Lorraine, with 40 percent unemployment," said Serge Boumenec, a representative of the Communist-led CGT union.</p>
<p>Unions say 2,000 jobs are to be axed at the shipyards over two years under a restructuring plan. They say the centre-right government, which says 657 jobs will be shed in 1997 out of 6,000, underestimates the cuts.</p>
<p>"Brest is at the end of the world. There's not much of a future and it's hard to see what may happen here," said one 76-year-old pensioner.</p>
<p>One union leader said about a third of the town's 170,000 population comprised families linked to the military. Brest shipyards have no major orders for 1999 and 2000 after they deliver the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle.</p>
