<title>ISRAEL: Israeli insurers told to act on cartel organisers.</title>

<p>Israel's insurance commissioner has asked the chairmen of seven insurance companies to take action against top executives who were convicted of operating a cartel, the Treasury said on Monday.</p>
<p>"I request that you convene your boards of directors for a special meeting on the convictions and their ramifications regarding the continued tenure of the people holding positions in the company and to inform me about the results of these meetings so that I can examine the need for other possible measures on this matter," insurance commissioner Doron Shorer said in a letter released today.</p>
<p>The letter follows a decision by the Jerusalem District Court on Friday handing down heavy fines and suspended jail sentences on the seven companies and their top executives.</p>
<p>Among those convicted in the case were Uzi Levy, managing director of Migdal Insurance, which is a subsidiary of Leumi Insurance Holdings Ltd, and Rimon Ben-Shaul, managing director of Clal Insurance Holdings Ltd, Israel's two biggest insurers.</p>
<p>Judge Yonatan Adiel imposed the penalties after the companies were convicted earlier of fixing premiums and limiting discounts offered to policy holders in commercial and home-owners' insurance during 1992.</p>
<p>Treasury sources said Shorer was not specifically calling for the six companies to dismiss the executives, although they said it was in his power to force dismissals.</p>
<p>"It is optimal that the commissioner not intervene, so he's letting them (the boards) decide," a source said. He said it was "impossible to know" what Shorer would do if the boards did not take action he deemed appropriate.</p>
<p>"I believe that the crimes committed ... by senior officials hurts their credibility and suitability to their positions in a way that has ramifications for the public's confidence in the insurance companies," Shorer said.</p>
