<p>The Universal SA led Polish Capital Group (PGK) placed a bid for at least 10 percent of shares of the country's largest newsstand chain RUCH SA, PGK said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>Last week Poland invited new bids for RUCH, after calling off talks with a consortium led by French Hachette when it failed to improve its offer.</p>
<p>PGK said that RUCH, which owns 17,000 kiosks nationwide and controls 65 percent of Poland's press distribution market, was worth some $200 million.</p>
<p>It said that it planned to give RUCH employees shares worth some $30 million and that it was ready to talk about social packages which could include individual work guarantees.</p>
<p>Hachette, which had signed an initial agreement with the treasury ministry late last year on a purchase of 75 percent of Ruch, has threatened unspecified action against the Polish government if it cancels the deal.</p>
