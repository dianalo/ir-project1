<p>The president of Brazilian metal, cement and pulp group Votorantim, Antonio Ermirio de Moraes, said three large consortia were likely to bid in the April 29 privatization auction of state mining giant CVRD, a newspaper said.</p>
<p>He said the consortia would be led by Votorantim, Brazil's largest steelmaker Companhia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN), and Brazilian metals and mining group Caemi, O Estado de Sao Paulo said.  </p>
<p>"We are aware that competition will be fierce. We are going to compete," Moraes was quoted as saying in O Estado de Sao Paulo.</p>
<p>A strategic 45 percent block of CVRD voting shares is being sold at auction on the Rio de Janeiro stock exchange April 29 for a minimum price of 3 billion reais ($2.83 billion).  </p>
<p>Votorantim is forming a consortium with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp, South Africa's Anglo American Corp and Banco Safra, while CSN is backed by Brazil's largest retail bank Bradesco and still hopes to join forces with South Africa's Gencor despite declarations by Gencor it is no longer interested in pursuing a CVRD bid.</p>
<p>Caemi-controled iron ore miner MBR is linking up with Japan's Mitsui &amp; Co, Australian mining company WMC Ltd, and Anglo-Australian mining conglomerate RTZ-CRA.</p>
