<p>Slovenian shares firmed 1.73 percent on Monday on the back of continued foreign demand for shares of newly privatised firms.</p>
<p>"Foreign investors, mostly Austrian banks, are currently designing prices on our market and if they continue buying Kolinska and Lek, the SBI index could exceed 1,000 soon," one broker said.</p>
<p>* The seven-share SBI index rose 16.05 points to 941.77.</p>
<p>* 13 shares rose and four fell, while seven were untraded.</p>
<p>* Turnover fell to 137.7 million tolars from 153.9 million.</p>
<p>* Newly privatised shares of pharmaceutical producer Lek were the most actively traded, firming 2.38 percent to 15,359 tolars on volume of 5,332 shares for total turnover of 81.9 million tolars.</p>
<p>* Financial consultancy Finmedia was the biggest gainer, firming 4.11 percent to 16,855 tolars on volume of 171 shares for total turnover of 2.8 million tolars.</p>
<p>* Construction company GPG was the leading decliner, caving in 9.09 percent to 6,855 tolars on volume of 24 shares for total turnover of 165,000 tolars. -- Novica Mihajlovic, Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
