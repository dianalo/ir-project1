<p>NWE jet fuel was steady on Friday, with traders seeing no easing in the recent tightness seen in the market, traders said.</p>
<p>They said the situation was unlikely to change in the near future with refiners busy sorting out 0.05 percent production ahead of the introduction of EU low sulphur regulations on October 1.</p>
<p>Fob cargo premiums were put at roughly Sept IPE +$25/+$26 a tonne. The barges were talked at Sept IPE +$21/22, fob ARA.</p>
<p>The Mediterranean was also very tight with premiums put at quotes fob Med high +$10. -- London Newsroom,+44 171 542 7714.</p>
