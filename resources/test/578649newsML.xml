<p>South African Breweries Ltd is pinning hopes on a cut in interest rates late this year to boost flagging private consumption expenditure (PCE) and revive domestic demand, finance director Nigel Cox said.</p>
<p>"(Low PCE) will constrain growth in the first six months of the current year," Cox told Reuters after the world's fourth biggest brewer unveiled 12 percent earnings growth for the year to March.</p>
<p>"We are hoping for an easing of interest rates in the second half of the year and clearly, when that comes through, we expect that PCE will start to pick up."</p>
<p>SAB's domestic beer division showed volume growth of two percent in 1996/97, although profits were up 16 percent.</p>
<p>Cox said beer volumes were in line with the company's econometric models, given current PCE growth of around 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>That growth rate was unlikely to improve in the first half of the current financial year, but should pick up to 3.0-3.5 percent in the second half as interest rates were cut, he said.</p>
<p>At the same time, SAB would continue to grow its international beer operations, which powered ahead last year with earnings up almost 50 percent.</p>
<p>"A number of these businesses are already doing extremely well and we will continue to grow them in their own marketplaces," Cox said.</p>
<p>SAB is planning new breweries in Kenya, Ethiopia and Angola.</p>
<p>In eastern Europe the company is now established as the region's largest brewer and Cox said the aim was to consolidate its position following moves into both Poland and Romania since last year.</p>
<p>Other countries in eastern Europe, including Russia and Bulgaria, were potential markets further down the road.  </p>
<p>Back home, SAB is grappling with some disappointing performances at its heavyweight stores and manufacturing subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Retailer OK Bazaars, in particular, which has been delisted from the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, recorded a loss last year of 74 million rand.</p>
<p>"We have an absolute priority to get OK Bazaars back on an even keel. It is clearly going through severe reconstruction right now, which will be ongoing for some time but we are working to get that business right," Co8 said.</p>
<p>However, complementary beverages increased earnings by 30 percent and good performances were also recorded by the international autoglass replacement operations and hotels.</p>
<p>Shares in SAB closed down 325 cents at 130.00 rand but off the day's low of 129.00.</p>
<p>Diluted earnings per share for the year to end-March came in at 605.3 cents versus 540.8, blow the consensus of analysts polled by Reuters of 617.8 cents. The year dividend of 287 cents was fractionally ahead of the consensus forecast of 286.3.</p>
