<p>Chrysler Corp said Thursday it has identified $1.2 billion in new cost savings from suppliers so far in the 1997 model year, up from $1 billion identified during the 1996 model year.</p>
<p>Chrysler said it will realize about $325 million of the $1.2 billion total during the 1997 calendar year. The rest of the savings will be realized in future years as the company introduces new models.</p>
<p>The savings are the result of Chrysler's Supplier Cost Reduction Effort (SCORE) campaign, which encourages suppliers to submit cost-saving ideas to the automaker.  </p>
<p>Started in 1989, SCORE asks suppliers to come up with cost-cutting ideas that amount to five percent of their sales to the automaker. The program has become increasingly important as fierce market competition puts pressure on Chrysler's pricing and threatens to eat into its fat profit margins.</p>
<p>Thomas Stallkamp, Chrysler's executive vice president of procurement and supply and head of minivan operations, said suppliers submit about 100 new ideas each week.  </p>
<p>"The SCORE program continues to be unique because cost-savings are shared with suppliers," Stallkamp said in a statement. "We're pursuing quality, efficiency and affordability without eroding our suppliers' profit margins."</p>
<p>Chrysler spends about $38 billion each year to purchase goods and services from suppliers, ranging from toilet tissue to car seats and brakes.</p>
<p>The automaker will realize $180 million in savings with the launch of its next-generation Dodge Intrepid this fall, said Chrysler spokesman David Barnas. Among the 426 specific actions implemented were the use of one catalytic converter instead of three on the previous model; a reduction in the size of the engine cooling system; and use of a lighter-weight material for the front and rear bumper fascias.</p>
<p>The company has had a program for the past eight years that asks suppliers to come up with cost-cutting measures that amount to five percent of the suppliers' annual sales.</p>
