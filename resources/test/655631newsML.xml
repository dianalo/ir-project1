<p>South African publishing firm Nasionale Pers Ltd is expected to deliver a sturdy 17 percent rise in year headline earnings, helped by profits at associated television and mobile phone businesses.</p>
<p>But analysts said on Thursday contributions from Nasper's core newspaper and educational units will be sluggish, outweighed by dividend income from M-Net Ltd and M-Cell Ltd .</p>
<p>"They are going to have very slow growth from their core operations. Print earnings growth is only forecast to grow at about four percent," said John Biccard, an analyst at HSBC Simpson Mckie.</p>
<p>The core magazine operations which publish "Huisgenoot" and "You" titles were, however, expected to perform well.</p>
<p>Analysts polled by Reuters forecast headline earnings per share for year to March 31 climbing to between 161.0 and 177.0 cents with consensus at 168.5 -- a rise of 17 percent over last year's 144.0 cents.</p>
<p>They said the 20.0 cent annual dividend announced on Thursday was lower-than-expected and earnings may disappoint when they are released next Tuesday. Naspers's dividend last year was 18.0 cents.</p>
<p>The firm is seen benefitting from a forecast 25 percent surge in year earnings at associate M-Net, a South African pay-television operator which reports results from Tuesday next week. New firm M-Cell would also contribute a dividend stream.</p>
<p>"For the first time Naspers will be getting a positive earnings number from M-Cell which was in the red last year," another analyst said.</p>
<p>Naspers' profits were seen capped by slower second half advertising revenues as well as tardiness on the part of the country's education authorities to place book orders.</p>
<p>Good growth at the magazine operations was seen threatened in the new financial year which began on April 1.</p>
<p>"Their magazines are under pressure as a lot of new publications are being launched especially in the women's interest area competing with Naspers's You and Huisgenoot," an analyst said.</p>
<p>Analysts said earnings after exceptional items would be skewed by the sale of pay television service Nethold, in which Naspers has a stake, to French group Canal Plus .</p>
