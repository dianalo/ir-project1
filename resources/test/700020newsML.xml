<p>ConAgra Inc said it expects double-digit earnings per share growth in fiscal 1998.</p>
<p>"We expect double-digit earnings per share growth in fiscal 1998 and another year of record earnings," the company said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The company also said, "ConAgra's most important financial objective is to average at least 20-percent cash earnings return on equity."</p>
<p>The company said its long-term trend line earnings per share growth target is 14 percent.  </p>
<p>"Our plans for fiscal year 1998 (begun May 26) indicate another successful year with continued margin expansion," the food processing giant said.</p>
<p>ConAgra added that it expects a first-quarter gain on the sale of its Country General specialty retailing business will have no material impact on earnings due to offsetting reserves related to other matters and above-budget marketing expenses.</p>
