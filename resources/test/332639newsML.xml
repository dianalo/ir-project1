<p>Turkey's budget deficit in 1996 totalled 1,215 trillion Turkish lira ($10.6 billion), up from 316.6 trillion a year ago, Finance Minister Abdullatif Sener said.</p>
<p>Government revenues during the year amounted to 2,736 trillion lira and spending totalled 3,951 trillion, he told a news conference.  </p>
<p>"The budget deficit came out 85 trillion lira less than expected because of an increase in the effectiveness of fiscal management and tax administration in the second half," Sener said.</p>
<p>He said the deficit was equal to 8.2 percent of GNP, compared with a forecast of 8.8 percent.</p>
<p>Parliament last month approved the government's planned balanced budget for 1997. Financial analysts are sceptical about its aims of wiping out the deficit.</p>
