<p>NWE gas oil was flat to slightly weaker on Wednesday as benchmark IPE futures stagnated and premiums remained unchanged, traders said.</p>
<p>June IPE gas oil was flat at $161.50 a tonne at 1152 GMT as was the July contract at $162.75 a tonne.</p>
<p>Heating oil barges traded at June IPE +$1.0 a tonne fob Rotterdam for refinery material for delivery up to June 25. Storage material was talked around June IPE +25-50 cents/+75 cents fob ARA.</p>
<p>Interest for first half June delivery material was dwindling with just two working days left.</p>
<p>Some sellers were looking to get premiums of around June IPE +$1.25-$1.50 for second half June material on the basis of the contango into July, but buyers were only bidding around 75 cents.</p>
<p>Cargo premiums were little changed with 0.2 percent cargoes talked at June IPE flat/+$1.00 cif NWE.</p>
<p>Low diesel material, meanwhile, was talked at June IPE +$5.0/+$7.0.</p>
<p>Traders said the market continued to be under pressure from Med cargoes despite the fact that some players appeared to be putting a fair amount of wintergrade material into storage because of the contango. -- London Newsroom, +44 171 542 7714</p>
