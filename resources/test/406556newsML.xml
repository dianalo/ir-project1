<p>Centennial Technologies Inc said Thursday it would restate its financial results for fiscal years 1994, 1995 and 1996 and the first two quarters of fiscal 1997 and expects to report "material cumulative losses" for the periods.  </p>
<p>"The anticipated restatements will relate both to the company's operations, including an inventory write-off and sales reversals, and to non-operating losses attributable to an anticipated write-down of the carrying value of certain investments," the company said.</p>
<p>Centennial said it would release the revised figures in six to 12 weeks.</p>
<p>It said the special committee it set up to investigate the matter was still probing the activities of Emanuel Pinez, the company's founder and former chief executive officer.  </p>
<p>Centennial, which makes personal computer memory cards, fired Pinez on February 11. He was subsequently arrested on suspicion of insider trading and securities fraud.</p>
<p>On February 18 the company said it expected to restate its financial results for fiscal 1996, ended last June 30, and for the first two quarters of fiscal 1997. It said that "certain financial records of the company appear to have been falsified."</p>
