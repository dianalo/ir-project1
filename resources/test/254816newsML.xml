<p>SIMEX Euroyen and Japanese government bond (JGB) futures received a boost after Tokyo stock prices fell sharply on the Dow's overnight drop, dealers said on Friday.</p>
<p>The 225-share Nikkei average fell below the key 20,000 points level for the first time in over three months before recovering some ground to close at 20,341.39.</p>
<p>"The Euroyen looks very firm given how stocks are performing. June should remain above 99.35 as long as the Nikkei stays weak," said a trader with a U.S. futures house.  </p>
<p>He said the June contract would face resistance at its new contract high of 99.38 and then at 99.42. It stood at 99.37 at 1110 GMT against an IMM close at 99.34.</p>
<p>March JGBs settled at 125.03 against their opening 124.90 and previous close at 125.10. Resistance is seen at 125.80.</p>
<p>Eurodollar futures finished firmer on spillover buying following the overnight release of U.S. retail sales data which showed a steep 0.4 percent drop in November.</p>
<p>The CPI (Consumer Price Index) was within expectations but retail sales were much weaker than expected," said the trader.  </p>
<p>The November CPI rose 0.3 percent while the core rate, which excludes food and energy price fluctuations, was up 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>March Eurodollars closed at 94.45 against their IMM finish at 94.44 after hitting a high of 94.47.</p>
<p>But dealers said the outlook for Eurodollar futures had turned less upbeat as the U.S. bond market is being led by the performance of U.S. stocks, which have taken on a fragile tone in recent weeks.</p>
<p>"I would sell March Eurodollars near 94.50 but I don't think we'll even see that," said the trader.</p>
