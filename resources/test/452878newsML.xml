<p>A leading Mexican opposition politician accused President Ernesto Zedillo late on Tuesday of owing his own government several years of overdue taxes on a property near the Pacific resort city of Acapulco.</p>
<p>Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, a fiery lawyer who led the conservative National Action Party to second place in the 1994 presidential race behind Zedillo, made the accusation during a live interview with Televisa television network.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Emilio Chuayffet denied the allegations and said Zedillo did not own any property in the area, according to Mexico City's Radio Red. No one at the President's office was available for comment.</p>
<p>Fernandez on Tuesday paid roughly 290,000 pesos ($36,000) in back taxes on a property in a posh residential district called Punta Diamante on the outskirts of Acapulco.</p>
<p>But the conservative said his case received widespread media attention while other politicians, including several members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), also owed taxes in the same development.</p>
<p>"There are others who own property in this development that have not paid their property tax for 1994, 1995, 1996 or 1997... That includes an important member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party. I'm not sure you want me to mention his name," Fernandez told Televisa's 24 Horas news programme.</p>
<p>"I should think so," answered news anchor Jacobo Zabludowsky.</p>
<p>"Zedillo Ponce de Leon, Ernesto," said Fernandez.</p>
<p>When asked if the former candidate could prove the charges, he said: "Absolutely. I have seen the papers."</p>
<p>Mexico's president holds near absolute power for a single six-year term and is rarely held to public scrutiny while in office, even by the press and opposition politicians.</p>
<p>Zedillo won the 1994 race with about half the popular vote, but has been dogged by an economic crisis that broke out soon after he took office. The Finance Ministry in Mexico has in recent months carried out a campaign to get wealthy Mexicans to pay their taxes, arresting several high-profile businessmen.</p>
<p>Fernandez, who campaigned strongly against government corruption, was hurt by revelations late last year that he had not paid taxes on the property.</p>
<p>However, Fernandez remains popular and some people unsuccessfully tried to get him to run for mayor of Mexico City in upcoming July elections.</p>
