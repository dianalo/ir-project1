<p>The prosecutor heading a snowballing graft probe sparked by the arrest of the head of Italy's state railways denied on Wednesday that politicians were currently under investigation.</p>
<p>Antonio Conte, chief prosecutor in the northwestern town of La Spezia, issued his statement after comments by one of his own staff that unnamed politicians were caught up in the affair triggered unease in the government and financial markets.</p>
<p>"In relation to some newspaper reports and the alarm that these have caused, I feel it is my duty to state that no politician is on the list of those being investigated by this office," Conte said.</p>
<p>"There are merely certain matters that we are evaluating. In any case, I exclude that, at least at this stage, members of the government are involved in the affair," he said.</p>
<p>The probe at La Spezia has echoes of the "Tangentopoli" (Bribesville) scandals of the early 1990s which swept away Italy's post-war political establishment and many of its business leaders.</p>
<p>The affair broke on Monday with news of the arrest of Lorenzo Necci, managing director of state railway Ferrovie dello Stato and one of Italy's most prominent public sector executives.</p>
<p>Necci, who has been planning a multi-billion-dollar high-speed rail project, was questioned by magistrates for about an hour at La Spezia jail on Wednesday.</p>
<p>His lawyers said he had provided "clarifications" to magistrates and that they would ask for him to be freed.</p>
<p>Necci was arrested at his country home near Rome on Sunday on suspicion of involvement in a host of crimes including fraud, embezzlement, false accounting, corruption and abuse of office.</p>
<p>At least five more people were arrested on Tuesday, including the managing director of an arms company and two magistrates.</p>
<p>Investigators have not given specific details of the case. Media reports have said judicial sources indicate that the probe focuses on suspected bribes for lucrative rail contracts.</p>
<p>One of La Spezia magistrates at La Spezia, Alberto Cardino, told reporters in response to questions on Tuesday night that certain politicians holding office were involved in the inquiry but refused to say whether they were in the government.</p>
<p>His tantalising comments led to banner headlines speculating about a new political scandal. Italian debt markets fell on the reports but regained ground after Conte's statement.</p>
<p>Cardino's remarks have drawn an angry response from the ex-communist Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), the biggest partner in the centre-left government led by Prime Minister Romano Prodi.</p>
<p>PDS leader Massimo D'Alema had urged the magistrate to disclose the names of any politicians "in the next few hours" or face blame for provoking political instability.</p>
<p>Prodi acknowledged on Tuesday that the arrest was "worrying for the image" of Italy, but insisted that his government, elected in April, was not involved.</p>
<p>Necci's arrest was not the first time scandal has touched the railway. In 1988, the whole board resigned in the so-called "Golden Sheets Affair" which revealed that Ferrovie dello Stato paid $110 million simply for linen and paper sheets for its sleeper service.</p>
