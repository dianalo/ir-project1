<p>German drugs group Schering AG said on Tuesday that provisional group net profits jumped 46 percent to a record 362 million marks ($217.2 million) for 1996, significantly ahead of its own forecasts for the years.</p>
<p>However, the group's chief financial officer Klaus Pohle told analysts that he expected net profit growth to slow to eight or nine percent in 1997, and for operating margins to improve by only a small amount.</p>
<p>The world's largest manufacturer of oral contraceptives reported provisional group sales rose 13 percent to 5.27 billion marks, of which 791 million marks came from its domestic market and 4.48 billion from abroad.</p>
<p>In January, Pohle said that he expected net profit of about 330 to 340 million marks for 1996, already a rise of more than 35 percent.</p>
<p>The results lifted Schering shares, ending bourse trade in Frankfurt up 2.20 marks at 145.40, having earlier hit a record high of 146.20 marks.</p>
<p>The current year would see high single-digit growth.</p>
<p>"We said before we published today's unexpectedly  high figure that we expected high single-digit growth," said Pohle. "We still expect growth of between eight and nine percent, which will leave us at around 400 million marks."</p>
<p>"All of our individual units contributed to the 13 percent sales growth. Once our 1995 acquisitions of Medrad Inc, Leiras and Jenapharma are stripped out, the rate of turnover growth was around eight percent," the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>Christine Dienhart, chemicals analyst at Bayerische Vereinsbank in Munich said: "The figures were better than we expected. Schering had a great year."</p>
<p>One of Schering's best-known products, the Betaferon drug for treating multiple sclerosis, faced competition for the first time last year in the United States. But the group said sales of the drug fell only four percent to 350 million marks.</p>
<p>Analysts said that they would be closely watching the effect of competition from Biogen's rival Avonex product on Betaferon, sold in the United States as Betaseron.</p>
<p>Pohle said group sales would be around 5.9 billion marks in 1997, with sales of Betaferon reaching 590 million marks.</p>
<p>Schering's therapeutics unit, which includes Betaferon, contributed 26 percent of group sales in 1996.</p>
<p>Dienhart said she was cautiously optimistic on Schering and would be keeping her "hold" recommendation on the share, with forecast earnings per share of 5.55 marks in 1996, 6.55 marks in 1997 and 7.25 marks in 1998.</p>
<p>Viewed sector by sector, the group's diagnostics business, largely x-ray media, amounted to 31 percent of overall sales at 1.61 billion marks, despite a mild setback in Japan because of lower prices and the weaker yen.</p>
<p>Overall, exchange rate movements had little impact on earnings, as weakness in the yen was compensated by the strength of the dollar, Schering said.</p>
<p>Schering's fertility control and hormone therapy unit contributed 30 percent of sales at 1.57 billion marks, largely due to disproportional growth in its hormone therapy unit and an increase in sales of oral contraceptives in Latin America.</p>
<p>The group said that its operating profit figure was hurt by restructuring costs of 60 million marks while goodwill write-offs at Jenapharm and Leiras meant it received no contributions as yet from the acquisitions.</p>
<p>Schering's AgrEvo crop protection unit contributed 25 million marks in profit to its parent during 1996 after registering losses in 1995.</p>
