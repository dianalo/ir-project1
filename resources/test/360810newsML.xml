<p>Indian cotton prices were steady in narrow trade on Thursday as cold weather and a regional poll continued to affect Punjab cotton arrivals, dealers said.</p>
<p>Punjab, a top cotton producer, is in northern India. State assembly elections are being there on Friday.</p>
<p>"New crop arrivals in the producing centres also remained low due to cold weather as well as assembly election in the Punjab region," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Mill demand was sluggish but limited supplies kept prices at last levels.</p>
<p>In spot deals Bengal-deshi was steady at 775/820 rupees per maund (37.32 kg) while Punjab saw-ginned was steady at 1,390/1,620 rupees per maund. Gujarat Kalyan (medium-staple) was quiet at 11,500/11,700 rupees per candy (355.56 kg).</p>
