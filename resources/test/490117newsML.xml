<p>Jamaica's soccer team, preparing for next week's World Cup qualifier away to Mexico, have lost their team bus and training pitch following last week's much-publicised brawl in a practice match in Mexico.</p>
<p>Jamaica official Carl Brown said from the team's hotel in the Mexican city of Toluca on Sunday that a private company had been providing the field and bus but withdrew them because of the publicity which followed Tuesday's incident.</p>
<p>Brown told the Caribbean News Agency (CANA) the Jamaicans, currently training on a pitch at their hotel, were now desperately searching for a new place to train.</p>
<p>"The field (at the hotel) is rather small and not quite suitable for our purposes," Brown said. "We will be trying our best to get a proper-sized field. As to how succesful we will be is another matter."</p>
<p>"The loss of the bus is not so important. We will simply hire one when we need it."   </p>
<p>The brawl forced a practice game against Mexican first division side Neza to be abandoned after 19 minutes.</p>
<p>Previously, Jamaica had caused another controversy during a friendly international away to Bolivia. Unable to cope with the thin air in the town of Oruro, 3,700 metres above sea level, the players stopped taking the game seriously as they crashed to a 6-0 defeat, leaving the Bolivian coach furious.</p>
<p>Jamaica arrived in Mexico three weeks before Sunday's game, in the final stage of the CONCACAF qualifying tournament, to acclimatise. The game will be played at altitude.</p>
<p>Horace Burrell, president of the Jamaican Football Federation, said Tuesday's fight had not adversely affected the morale of the team. "If anything we are much more united than we were before," he said.</p>
<p>The Jamaicans have insisted they did not start the brawl but merely defended themselves as best they could.</p>
<p>The United States, Canada, Costa Rica and El Salvador make up the six-team group from which the top three qualify for the World Cup in France next year.</p>
<p>Jamaica, aiming to become the first English-speaking Caribbean nation to reach the finals, drew their first game 0-0 at home to the United States.</p>
