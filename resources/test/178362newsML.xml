<p>Doctors said on Sunday that Russian President Boris Yeltsin was in "satisfactory condition" after his quintuple bypass operation but the Kremlin's chief doctor said he would stay in hospital for at least 10 days.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency quoted Sergei Mironov as saying that Yeltsin was likely to move to the Barvikha sanatorium outside Moscow "after November 20 or 22".</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, spent several weeks before the operation at Barvikha, a complex of government dachas and resthouses, and he also recovered there from two heart attacks last year.</p>
<p>Mironov said Yeltsin's recovery was going according to plan and the foreign specialists who advised the Russian team on the operation were leaving Moscow on Sunday or had already left.</p>
<p>The foreign team included bypass pioneer Michael Debakey, 88, who told Reuters last week that Yeltsin could be back in the Kremlin within two or three weeks.</p>
<p>A medical statement released by the Kremlin press office on Sunday said Yeltsin's blood pressure, pulse and temperature were stable and the president was being allowed to move around his suite of rooms in the Central Clinical Hospital.</p>
<p>"The patient was allowed to move for two or two and a half hours a day within rooms...in the Central Clinical Hospital, including his working office," the statement said.</p>
<p>It said the council of doctors would meet daily in the next week to assess Yeltsin's recovery.</p>
<p>Yeltsin was back on his feet on Thursday, just two days after the seven-hour bypass operation, carried out at Moscow's Cardiology Research Centre by top surgeon Renat Akchurin.</p>
<p>On Friday he was transferred to the more familiar surroundings of the Central Clinical Hospital, where he was treated after two heart attacks last year.</p>
<p>Akchurin told Russian television on Saturday that doctors would remove the sutures in the next 10 or 12 days.</p>
<p>"He should not run, jump or play tennis, but he will be capable of talking with people, issuing orders," Akchurin said. "I have not seen a sharper mind."</p>
<p>Akchurin said thorough preparation had allowed doctors to reduce risks associated with the operation substantially, but he admitted there had been times when he thought surgery would have to be cancelled completely.</p>
<p>"He was such a grave heart patient that at first we thought that perhaps we would not be able to handle the situation," he said, highlighting problems with bleeding.</p>
<p>But once preparations were completed, Yeltsin himself chose November 5 for the operation, Akchurin said. Other possibilities had been to operate as late as November 9.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has issued several decrees and statements from his hospital ward but has yet to appear on television since his operation.</p>
<p>RIA news agency quoted Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky as saying that no working meetings were planned for the president this week to give Yeltsin time to recover.</p>
