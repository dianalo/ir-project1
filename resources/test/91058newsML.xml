<p>Terms have been set for Kookmin Bank's upcoming Hong Kong dollar floating rate note issue, bankers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The issue will be HK$1 billion in size and have a final maturity of three years. There are no put or call options.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch and Sakura Finance Asia have been mandated to arrange the issue.</p>
<p>The notes will be priced at par to float at 40 basis points over the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate.</p>
<p>Fees for the bond-style issue are 30 basis points, split as 15 basis points for management and underwriting and 15 basis points for selling.</p>
<p>No application will be made to the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to accept the notes for use at its Liquidity Adjustment Facility (LAF), or discount window.</p>
<p>Kookmin Bank is not eligible for the facililty because it does not have a branch in Hong Kong, bankers said.</p>
<p>Eligibility for LAF makes an issue more attractive to banks because holders of the qualifying debt can engage in repurchase agreements with the Monetary Authority, increasing liquidity.</p>
