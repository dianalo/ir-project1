<p>China is to allow Winterthur Insurance of Switzerland to sell insurance in the domestic market, making it the first European insurer able to compete with Chinese firms, Swiss President Jean-Pascal Delamuraz said on Friday.</p>
<p>Delamuraz made the remarks to reporters shortly before he wound up a visit to Beijing. He gave no further details but Swiss embassy officials quoted Chinese officials as saying the insurer had been chosen to receive a domestic licence.</p>
<p>Embassy officials said formal approval for the hotly contested licence to sell insurance in the fast-growing Chinese market was expected to be announced in the future.</p>
<p>Winterthur has a representative office in Beijing but that does not entitle it to sell insurance in the Chinese market.</p>
<p>China has been opening up its domestic insurance market slowly, fearing that foreign competitors might overwhelm the once heavily protected industry.</p>
<p>China has already allowed American International Assurance Co Ltd and Tokio Marine and Fire Insurance Co Ltd to conduct business directly and a Hong Kong unit of Manufacturers Life Insurance Co of Canada has gained approval for a joint venture with the cash-rich state oil trader Sinochem.</p>
<p>American International Assurance, part of the American International Group, has been particularly successful. It has forced domestic competitors in the Shanghai market to adopt many of its practices, such as paying bigger commissions on insurance policy sales.</p>
<p>Swiss embassy officials could not give further details of the Winterthur plans and company representatives were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Australian-listed HIH Winterthur International Ltd, about 48 percent owned by Winterthur of Switzerland, has said that it expected to enter China's general insurance market by investing $16 million in a joint venture vehicle, which would have a stake in recently formed Yong An Property Insurance Co Ltd.</p>
<p>Chinese insurance officials have said that they expected to see a trend toward joint ventures as the market opens up to foreign concerns.</p>
