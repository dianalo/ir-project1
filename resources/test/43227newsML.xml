<p>W.W. Grainger Inc said Tuesday it had reached agreement in principle to acquire the Canadian industrial distribution business of Acklands Ltd.</p>
<p>Acklands is Canada's largest nationwide distributor of broad-line industrial supplies, Grainger said.</p>
<p>The agreement provides for Acklands to receive about C$345 million, of which about C$155 million will be cash, with the remainder consisting of a stake in a Grainger Canadian subsidiary.  </p>
<p>Shares in the Canadian subsidiary are exchangeable into Grainger common shares, Grainger said.</p>
<p>Completion of the transaction is subject to negotiation of a definitive agreement and approval of the Grainger and Acklands boards.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to close by December 31, 1996.</p>
<p>Acklands's Canadian industrial distribution business had sales of more than C$400 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 1996.</p>
<p>"This acquisition, along with our operations in Puerto Rico and our new presence in Mexico, will strengthen our leadership position in the North American market," Robert Keyser, Grainger president, said in a statement. "It will also provide us with the opportunity to expand our position in Canada and better serve the Canadian operations of our national accounts."</p>
<p>Grainger, with 1995 sales of US$3.3 billion, distributes maintenance, repair and operating supplies.</p>
