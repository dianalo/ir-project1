<p>All 88 people aboard an Iranian military plane which crashed in northeastern Iran on Thursday have been killed, an armed forces statement said on Sunday.</p>
<p>"The armed forces of the Islamic republic of Iran in a statement issued here Sunday announced that all the 88 passengers and the crew of the C-130 plane that crashed...in northeastern Iran on Thursday, are killed," the official news agency IRNA said.</p>
<p>It said the reasons for the crash were still not known and that an air force team was investigating the incident.</p>
<p>Iran had said people aboard the C-130 Hercules transport plane were military men and their family members.</p>
<p>The accident is the latest in a series of air crashes in the past few years involving civilian and military planes, most of which date from before the 1979 Islamic revolution.</p>
<p>Iranian authorities have blamed some of the accidents on technical failures in the ageing planes but have not fully explained the causes of other crashes.</p>
