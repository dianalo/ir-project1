<p>The value of Venezuelan imports in April rose 4.7 percent, or $39.7 million, to $885 million compared to April last year, according to preliminary trade figures from the Central Office of Statistics and Information (OCEI).</p>
<p>The April figures took total imports over the first four months of the year to $3.198 billion, up 23.3 percent from the same period in 1996, the OCEI said.</p>
<p>Venezuelan trade figures are closely watched by analysts for signs of a recovery in domestic demand, as well as the effect of what many say is an overvalued bolivar.  </p>
<p>OCEI did not provide April figures, but the private sector accounted for the vast majority of imports over the four months, with 85.5 percent of the total.</p>
<p>Electrical goods was the biggest category of imports with 31.3 percent of the four month total, then chemical products with 11.1 percent and base metals with 10.5 percent.</p>
<p>The United States was the top exporter to Venezuela with 47.2 percent, followed by Colombia with 5.1 percent, Brazil with five percent and Germany with 4.8 percent, the OCEI said</p>
