<headline>N.League's Pivetti looks to Italy political centre.</headline>

<p>Irene Pivetti, a prominent member of Italy's separatist Northern League until a high-profile falling-out with its leader Umberto Bossi, said on Sunday she was now looking to the centre ground of Italian politics.</p>
<p>She told Il Giornale newspaper in an interview that she thought the two main centre-right and centre-left blocs would not last and Italy was not heading for a bi-polar system.</p>
<p>Most people wanted "something different, something we could call social centre", Pivetti said, adding that she would like the support of Fiat cars boss Cesare Romiti.</p>
<p>"I don't think Romiti will enter politics directly, but certainly I would like him allied to my project," Pivetti said.</p>
<p>Pivetti, the sharp-tongued former speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, has fallen out with Bossi over his increasingly strident calls for independence for northern Italy.</p>
<p>The League recently disowned her, saying she had not paid her subscriptions for two years and was not therefore a member.</p>
<p>"With these affirmations she has broken off her relationship with the League," said Roberto Maroni, a former interior minister and leading party member.</p>
<p>"If Pivetti confirms these statements it will mean she has resigned...But it's a mistaken decision because this way she is ending a promising and brilliant political career.</p>
<p>"Anyone who leaves the League goes nowhere, they're not recyclable," he said.</p>
<p>Bossi plans to declare "independence" for his would-be northern republic of "Padania" on September 15, while supporters form a human chain along the banks of the River Po, which he would like to be the frontier. Pivetti is planning not to go.</p>
