<title>USA: New safety rules proposed for passenger trains.</title>

<p>Federal officials Monday proposed a series of steps to improve railroad safety by requiring railroads to set new standards for emergency response and to better mark and maintain emergency passenger exists.</p>
<p>The action by the Federal Railroad Administration followed standards developed by the agency and recommendations by the National Transportation Safety Board after several major accidents in recent years.</p>
<p>In one, a commuter train and an Amtrak train collided head-on in Silver Spring, Maryland, February 16, 1996, killing 11 people and injuring more than 20. Officials said fewer might have died if emergency exits had been working properly.</p>
<p>"Safety is our top priority," said FRA Administrator Jolene Molitoris. Tragic accidents in recent years demonstrated the need to accelerate our plans to improve the way railroads respond in emergency situations."</p>
<p>Under the rules, passenger railroads and freight lines that run passenger trains over their tracks would be required to have emergency response plans covering communications, employee training and onboard emergency equipment.</p>
<p>It would also require lines to mark and test emergency exits and periodically conduct emergency simulations.</p>
<p>The FRA said that commuter lines have already nearly completed implementing provisions in an emergency order issued after the Silver Spring accident.</p>
<p>These included requirements that railroad cars have easily accessible quick release mechanisms near exterior passageway doors, removable windows or kick panels in doors and prominently display reflective signs marking all exits.</p>
