<p>A wealthy couple from West Virginia will spend at least three more months in prison on this Caribbean island while the courts prepare to try them for the murder of a water taxi driver, a magistrate ruled on Tuesday.</p>
<p>After a preliminary hearing in which the prosecution presented more than two dozen witnesses, Magistrate Paula Delves ruled that James and Penny Fletcher of Huntingdon, West Virginia, must stand trial for the murder of Jerome "Jolly" Joseph, a water taxi driver who was found shot to death on Oct. 9, 1996.</p>
<p>The penalty for a murder conviction in St. Vincent is death by hanging.</p>
<p>The Fletchers, who had been yachting around St. Vincent since August 1996, were arrested and charged with Joseph's murder on Oct. 30.</p>
<p>Joseph, 30, was reported missing on Oct 6. His water taxi was found on the following day containing bullets and blood. Two days later his body was found.</p>
<p>During the preliminary hearing prosecution witnesses testified that Penny Fletcher had been having an affair with Joseph. Prosecutors also said the couple were the last people seen with him and that their revolver was missing.</p>
<p>Defence attorneys had argued that there was no physical evidence linking the Fletchers to Joseph's death.</p>
<p>"We feel that the case is not there. There just isn't evidence," Roberto Feliberti, one of the Fletchers' attorneys, said after Delves' ruling.</p>
<p>The Fletchers, who pleaded innocent, have been imprisoned in St. Vincent since their arrest.</p>
<p>Tuesday's ruling meant the Fletchers will spend at least another three months behind bars, as the trial was scheduled to begin sometime in the court session beginning in June.</p>
