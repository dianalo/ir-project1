<p>Brent crude futures closed down eight cents after touching a fresh 13-month low on Wednesday evening on late Wall Street fund selling, brokers said.</p>
<p>July IPE last traded at $17.42 a barrel after slipping to a low of $17.32, the front month's lowest since May 20, 1996. Just over an hour earlier July had risen to touch the intra day high at $17.90.</p>
<p>Brokers said New York bears took the lead partly on the back of news suggesting there could be less trouble than oil markets had anticipated for sales of Iraqi crude in the second six month phase of the U.N. oil-for-food plan.</p>
<p>Iraqi Ambassador Nizar Hamdoon told Reuters on Wednesday that he foresaw no political wrangling over setting in motion the renewed oil-for-food deal with the United Nations.</p>
<p>Instead, Hamdoon said Iraq was simply following procedures that a new aid distribution plan be in place before oil sales can restart.</p>
<p>U.S. funds seized on the news to sell futures down to protect large short positions, helping propel London lower in sympathy.</p>
<p>"Open interest has been rising in a falling market...there are a lot of shorts out there which don't want to be exposed if we push up to $18.00," a broker said.</p>
<p>"The market is technically weak and it only needs one headline to pull it sharply down," another broker said.</p>
<p>Others cited bearish talk that Libya could send two Libyan suspects in the Lockerbie Pan Am bombing oversees for trial, thereby opening the way for an easing of sanctions on Tripoli.</p>
<p>July's failure earlier to break above $17.90 was said by some to have fuelled London's retreat.</p>
<p>The front month IPE contract had hit $17.45 a barrel on Tuesday, a level also not seen since May 1996.</p>
<p>Brent had made sharp climbs in mid afternoon, buoyed by news of Iraqi interference with U.N. helicopters.</p>
<p>The second term of the $2-billion oil-for-food agreement was renewed from June 8, but traders have reported delays in signing contracts. Time is needed to put into place a new plan for the distribution of aid and to submit a new pricing formula.</p>
<p>In addition, a senior U.N. official has written to the Security Council detailing four incidents of interference with U.N. helicopters in Iraq "in which the lives of the crews...and the aircraft themselves," were endangered.</p>
<p>June IPE gas oil last traded up 75 cents at $162.25 a tonne.</p>
