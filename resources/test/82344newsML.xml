<p>Taleban military chiefs now running the Afghan capital Kabul have given the go-ahead for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to pursue relief operations, the Swiss-run body said on Friday.</p>
<p>But the Islamic militia's seizure and street execution of former president Najibullah and his brother clearly angered the United Nations and sparked an appeal for "maximum restraint" from Human Rights Commissioner Jose Ayala-Lasso.</p>
<p>Senior ICRC official Jean-Pierre Monod told a Geneva news conference a 35-truck convoy would be leaving Pakistan on Sunday bringing 300 tonnes of food for the some 250,000 destitute people his organisation was supporting in a devastated Kabul.</p>
<p>Approval for the convoy and for the ICRC to continue working in hospitals and prisons around the city, abandoned by the administration of President Burhanuddin Rabbani, had been given just hours after the Taleban marched in overnight, he said.</p>
<p>"We have to continue our work to help victims of the conflict," added Monod, in overall charge of ICRC operations in Asia.</p>
<p>"We have been helping around a quarter of a million people in Kabul, about 25 per cent of the city's population. And with the winter coming nothing indicates that this number will diminish -- on the contrary, we might be facing an even worse emergency," he said.</p>
<p>Although the new Taleban authorities in Kabul seemed ready to work with the ICRC, which aims to fill the role of a neutral intermediary working to relieve suffering in armed conflicts, they clearly got off to a bad start with the U.N.</p>
<p>To seize Najibullah, the country's Soviet-backed left-wing leader from 1987-92, and his brother Shahpur Ahmadzai, Taleban fighters raided the apparently empty U.N. mission compound where the pair took refuge four years ago.</p>
<p>U.N. peace envoy for Afghanistan Norbert Holl, in a statement issued in Islamabad, said the abduction was a grave violation of the immunity of the mission and expressed "deep dismay" at the killing of the brothers.</p>
<p>He said his mission "deeply deplores these tragic events which cast a doubt over the willingness of those responsible to achieve reconciliation and guarantee justice in the area controlled by them."</p>
<p>In Geneva, a U.N. spokeswoman said Ayala Lasso was appealing to Taleban supreme leader Mullah Mohammad Omar "to exercise maximum restraint and ensure the basic rights of all Afghans, particularly the civilian population..."</p>
<p>At his news conference, the ICRC's Monod said a "major disaster" had been avoided in Kabul by the decision of the Rabbani administration on Thursday to pull its forces out and not fight on the streets of the already-devastated city.</p>
<p>And he said the ICRC hoped for humanitarian reasons that the ousted government would not try to retake it by force.</p>
<p>"I hope that they will have the wisdom to find another way to interact with the Taleban than to provoke new battles for Kabul which would mean attacking the city again from the outside," he declared.</p>
<p>Monod indicated there was no early sign that the Taleban, who have pledged to enforce a strict Islamic system severely restricting the activities of women and girls outside the home, would put limits on ICRC female expatriate staff.</p>
<p>He said that in the southern city of Kandahar, controlled by the movement for the past year, the Taleban had allowed a foreign ICRC woman surgeon to treat men as well as women.</p>
<p>"We have a team of 17 people, eight of whom are ladies, and they are working normally and are accepted," he said. "It is a matter of explaining to the Taleban why there is no option...It is a matter of being pragmatic," he said.</p>
<p>But Afghan women nurses employed by the ICRC had been restricted in Kandahar hospitals to working in female wards.</p>
