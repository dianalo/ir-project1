<p>A South Korean government official said on Wednesday he was sceptical about a report on the size of a new titanium ore deposit discovered in a southeastern province of the country and also questioned its commercial value.</p>
<p>"The amount seems to be exaggerated though we believe the deposit has some titanium ore," a trade ministry official said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the South Korean Yonhap news agency reported that a geological research team from Chungnam National University had discovered the world's largest deposit of titanium ore in South Kyongsang province.  </p>
<p>"We are somewhat sceptical as we can not be sure of the computation for the total reserves. The research team only drilled 200 meters, yet it said it had confirmed 50 million tonnes of titanium ore," the ministry official said.</p>
<p>The research team, lead by professor Jeong Ji-gon and others, said they had discovered titanium ore reserves of about 50 million tonnes through a 200-meter deep drilling survey.</p>
<p>The 70-metre wide, 15-km long and eight-km deep titanium ore deposit is estimated to have total reserves of two billion tonnes, Jeong told Reuters.  </p>
<p>But he was not sure whether the ore had much commercial viability.</p>
<p>"We believe the sampled ore has a titanium purity of four to 6.7 percent," Jeong said.</p>
<p>He said commercially useable ore has to have a purity of more than 15 percent.</p>
<p>The ministry official said the government had already surveyed the deposit through a state-run resource research institute during a three-year survey from 1990. At that time, the institute had said that the deposit had only 8.7 million tonnes of titanium ore, he said.  </p>
<p>"We don't know how much commercial value the deposit has," said an official with Hankook Titanium Industry Co Ltd, the only South Korean titanium company.</p>
<p>"We tried to reach the research team to get more information on the new discovery but we were unable to do so," the Hankook official said.</p>
<p>He said Hankook imports about 100,000 tonnes a year of titanium ilmenite ore from Malaysia, Australia, Vietnam and India and produces about 30,000 tonnes a year of titanium annatase, which is mainly used in the production of paints.  </p>
<p>Hankook exports between 12,000 tonnes to 15,000 tonnes of annatase a year, he added.</p>
<p>South Korea imports about 60,000 tonnes of titanium rutile a year, which is also used in the paints industry, the Hankook official said.</p>
<p>An official with Poongsan Corp said the company is importing around a 1,000 tonnes of titanium plate a year to produce titanium alloy tube.</p>
