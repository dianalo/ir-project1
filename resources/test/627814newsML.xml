<p>Australian wool prices sustained their upward trend at sales this week in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle, the Australian Council of Wool Exporters said.</p>
<p>The eastern market indicator rose 25 cents to a 21-month high of 700 cents a kg clean while the western market indicator rose 29 cents to 658 cents a kg clean.</p>
<p>"With the eastern market indicator reaching 700 cents a kg clean, the signals to growers are positive," the council said in its weekly market review.</p>
<p>A total of 100,582 bales were offered at auction with a pass-in rate of 6.9 percent.  </p>
<p>The council said there was widespread competition in the market with prominent but varying participation over the first two days.</p>
<p>Price rises occured evenly over a wide range of types, reflecting the good selection available with quality Tasmanian and Victorian wools being notable and attracting good competition.</p>
<p>"Optimism was evident in the trade with reports that stocks beyond the early stage processing sector of the pipeline were falling, resulting in interest from Japanese buyers in particular," it said.  </p>
<p>In the futures market a total of 392 contracts were traded in the 21 micron contract in the week ended Thursday. Open interest increased by 97 contracts to close at 1,054. The August 1976 contract closed 40 cents up at 855 cents a kg clean.</p>
<p>Wool International said it sold 31,198 bales in the week ended Thursday, reducing its stockpile to 1,653,624 bales.</p>
<p>Sales next week will be held in Sydney and Fremantle with about 39,000 bales on offer.</p>
