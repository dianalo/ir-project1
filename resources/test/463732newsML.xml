<p>The German bourse operating company Deutsche Boerse AG said on Monday it was postponing trade in the December 1997 Bund future, due to start trading tomorrow.</p>
<p>"We have postponed trading in the December 1997 bund future, which was planned to start on Tuesday. The background is a planned change in the contract specifications with a view to extending the duration of the ten year Bund," a Deutsche Boerse spokesman said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) said it was suspending its December 1997 Bund futures contract pending a review.  </p>
