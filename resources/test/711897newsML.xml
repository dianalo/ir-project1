<p>The overnight interbank rate remained at 5.8/6.0 percent on Monday due to easy availability of funds particularly at the short-end of the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said lending by foreign banks continued to pressure the overnight rate.</p>
<p>"Foreign banks are still long and lending at the short-end," said a dealer at a Malaysian bank. He said the market remained flush despite some fund outflows from Bank Negara intervention selling in the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>Banking sources said the central bank sold an estimated $400 million last week to defend the ringgit.</p>
<p>Dealers said a one-billion ringgit Bank Negara bill issue on Tuesday, against a 500-million ringgit maturity on Friday, was also unlikely to have much impact on interbank rates.</p>
<p>Certain large commercial banks were seen lending on the one-month on Friday with some suspecting that it was on behalf of Bank Negara, they said.</p>
<p>Earlier, one-week money was at 7.30/50 percent against 7.00/50 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>One- and three-month money were at 7.50/80 percent against 7.50/60 percent.</p>
<p>"Rates have more or less stabilised," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Rates had moved wildly on Friday following a volatile swaps market, triggered by rumours of a Bank Negara meeting with bank chief executives to discuss the possibility of introducing selective capital controls to defend the ringgit.</p>
<p>But banking sources said there was no such meeting.</p>
<p>Swaps rates fell further on Monday though they were still above levels seen early last week, with one-month swaps at 40/50 points compared with 100 on Friday.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were marginally higher.</p>
<p>One futures market dealer said some players took new positions as they anticipated the interbank rates in the cash market to move down with the return of liquidity in the system.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was up two to 92.57, or an implied yield of 7.43 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract rose two to 92.72, or 7.28 percent and March 1998 was also up two to 92.76, or 7.24 percent.</p>
