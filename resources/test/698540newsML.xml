<p>Ukraine's Kalyshsky Magniyeviy Zavod magnesium plant plans to increase output when world prices move higher, the plant's deputy director said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The boom in prices has not come yet -- we are waiting and then we will increase output and exports," Orest Zborovsky said by telephone from the town of Kalush, some 550 km west of the Ukrainian capital Kiev.</p>
<p>He said 1997 output was forecast at 25,000 tonnes but gave no comparison for 1996. He also did not say how much output the facility exported or over what period of time it would boost production.</p>
<p>"Prices are now rising by $50 a week, so we'll wait some time," Zborovsky said. "Our strategy is to wait for a peak in prices because demand for magnesium is constantly growing."</p>
<p>Zborovsky denied talk in the European market that his plant might be having some problems since it had delivered late to consumers in Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia and Hungary.</p>
<p>"There were no production delays -- rather, some consumers paid late," he said. "That's why we were late with some deliveries because we are working on a money-first principle.</p>
<p>"We feel eastern and central European consumers want more magnesium but we are not in a rush to export more."</p>
