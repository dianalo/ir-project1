<headline>Japan rubber futures seen mixed, upside limited.</headline>

<p>Japanese rubber futures' markets are likely to be mixed this week after the spot expiry on Tuesday, but the near-term oversupply trend will continue to pressure the markets, particularly nearby months, traders said.</p>
<p>"The large amount of deliveries today was largely in line with previous expectations. Trading activity could be more or less the same as the recent pattern, unless there are fresh incentives to spur the market," said an analyst at a commodity brokerage.</p>
<p>"Any upside potential will be limited on rising rubber stocks and expectations that large deliveries will continue at next month's expiry," the analyst said.</p>
<p>The market has suffered from a lack of fresh incentives in recent weeks, with activity mainly driven by technical factors.</p>
<p>The spot September contract on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) expired at noon at 130.7 yen, down from 134.1 yen last Friday. Deliveries totalled 2,068 lots.</p>
<p>The spot September contract on the Kobe Rubber Exchange expired at 128.8 yen with 1,314 lots of deliveries, up from 126.2 yen last Friday.  </p>
<p>Another analyst said he expects nearby months to slip to the upper end of 120 yen per kg, while any falls in distant months could be limited, as lower Japanese futures' prices compared with producing countries could make sellers cautious.</p>
<p>He said the move was likely to widen the contango on TOCOM.</p>
<p>Japanese traders said the trend of rising rubber stocks continued to cast a shadow over the market.</p>
<p>Japan's natural rubber stocks at designated warehouses rose to 45,042 tonnes as of September 10, up 3,172 tonnes from end-August, according to the Rubber Trade Association of Japan.</p>
<p>It was the first time Japan's rubber stocks had broken above the 45,000-tonne level since September 1990.</p>
<p>Traders said Japan's natural rubber stocks were expected to rise to 54,000 to 55,000 tonnes by early November.</p>
<p>"Although Japan's natural rubber demand for tyres remains strong, Japanese end-users have already covered requirements for this year. As a result, there is little prospect of rubber stocks slipping for more than two months," one trader said.</p>
<p>The Thai rubber offer price to Japan was quoted at 126.50 U.S. cents on Tuesday, down from 128.50 U.S. cents on Sept 17.  </p>
<p>In the local physical market, Thai benchmark rubber to large-lot end-users in Tokyo was quoted at 147 yen per kg as of Tuesday, against 146 yen on Sept 17.</p>
