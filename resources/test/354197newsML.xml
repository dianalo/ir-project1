<p>Liposome Co said on Tuesday that Abelcet, its proprietary antifungal agent, received approval in Spain as first-line treatment of patients with candidiasis.</p>
<p>Candida species cause the most common types of invasive fungal infections, Liposome said. Fatality rates for patients with candidiasis were between 30 and 40 percent, it said.</p>
<p>The company said 14 countries have approved Abelcet, or amphotericin B lipid complex injection, for the treatment of various severe systemic fungal infections.</p>
<p>Abelcet was approved in October 1995 in Spain for the second-line treatment of systemic fungal infections.</p>
<p>The treatment has been approved as a first-line therapy for candidiasis in Denmark, Italy, the United Kingdom and Austria. Greece has approved Abelcet for first-line treatment for cryptococcal meningitis, a common infection in patients with AIDS, the company said.</p>
