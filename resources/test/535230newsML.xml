<p>President Boris Yeltsin has appointed First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov as fuel and energy minister, the Kremlin said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Nemtsov, a youthful liberal, was recently drafted into the cabinet as part of a wide-ranging government reshuffle to oversee the restructuring of natural monopolies like gas, electricity and railways and housing reform.  </p>
<p>Nemtsov, who is 37, is one of Russia's most popular politicians and is seen as a possible successor to Yeltsin after the president retires in the year 2000.</p>
<p>In a radio address to the nation earlier on Thursday Yeltsin, 66, said he wanted to put more younger people in positions of responsibility, saying they were the best guarantee of Russia's economic reforms.</p>
<p>Earlier this week during a tour of the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk Nemtsov also called for young people to take a lead in Russian politics and industry. Nemtsov has praised Yeltsin regularly and refers to him as a kind tsar in a new book.</p>
<p>Until his promotion to the government, Nemtsov was governor of the car-making city of Nizhni Novgorod and its surrounding region, 400 km (250 miles) east of Moscow, where he pioneered privatisation and other market reforms.</p>
