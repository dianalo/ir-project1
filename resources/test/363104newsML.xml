<p>Argentine stocks seesawed in a narrow range and closed moderately higher Friday, reclaiming the 700 mark on the leading index, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Investors were encouraged by the drop in U.S. long bond yields following today's jobs data, which removed any uncertainty in the markets," said Luis Alvarez of traders Alvarez y Cia. "When things calm down abroad, bolsa players cheer up and focus on local factors such as the good outlook for the economy."</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index rose 0.7 percent to 702.99, stretching gains for the week to 1.5 percent.  </p>
<p>Floor volume grew to 26.2 million pesos from 21.2 million Thursday, while over-the-counter turnover recovered to healthy levels of 126.8 million pesos against 85.5 million Thursday.</p>
<p>The broad market index closed up 0.3 percent, with winners outstripping losers 36 to 15 and 16 issues closing flat.</p>
<p>Top main-tier performers included steelmakers Acindar and Siderca, which followed through on a rally Thursday to close up 2.5 percent and 2.3 percent, respectively. Traders attributed the sharp sector rise to good company results released earlier this week and to Acindar's successful $100 bond placement Friday.  </p>
<p>"Profits by listed companies in the current reporting period have confirmed expecations of economic recovery. Steel especially, because that industry is seeing record production and record exports," Alvarez said.</p>
<p>On the other hand market bellwether YPF closed off 0.9 percent on falling crude oil prices and talk that wholesale bank Comafi might buy out employees' 10 percent stake in the company, dealers said.</p>
<p>Also hurt was the telephone sector, whose ADRs swung sharply from gains to losses early in New York on news that a judge suspended tariff changes announced last week.  </p>
<p>After the initial shock, Telecom still managed to close up 0.2 percent on the bolsa, while Telefnica shed 0.7 percent.</p>
<p>"The tariff changes will probably go through in the end, but this is a setback and investors may get cold feet considering how they've stocked up on the telephone stocks in the past few days," another trader said.</p>
<p>The day's biggest MerVal loser was construction stock Polledo, off 1.9 percent. The blue-chip standout was gas distributor Transportadora de Gas del Sur, which surged 4.7 percent.</p>
