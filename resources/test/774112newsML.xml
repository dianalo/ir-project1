<p>KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and Northwest  Airlines will not be creating a joint, autonomous, cargo company as  part of their plans to extend their existing operating alliance, a  Dutch press report said.</p>
<p>The Rotterdam-based Nieuwsblad Transport, quoting Northwest spokesman  Doug Killian said Northwest will carry out commercial and marketing  activities for KLM Cargo in the U.S. and will partly do so in Asia.</p>
<p>Killian said that Northwest's freight stations in Frankfurt, Paris  and London, will come under KLM Cargo in the extended alliance, although  he declined to comment on the impact on the staff concerned, the Dutch  paper added.</p>
<p>Joint pricing will be introduced and there will eventually be an integrated,  electronic freight system, it said.</p>
<p>A KLM spokesman refused to comment on the report, quoting KLM's initial  press statement saying that the airlines "will intensify their cooperation  in the air freight sector".</p>
<p>He said further comment would only be made after the 60-day discussion  period between the two carriers.</p>
<p>Killian told Nieuwsbald: "Both Northwest and KLM are strong freight  companies. We have eight freighters (Boeing 747-200Fs) and last year  the freight income was $785 million. We are striving towards a far-reaching  integration which means that we will buy freight capacity from KLM  between Amsterdam and the Far East. That is a market where we are  not represented," the article stated.</p>
<p>And KLM Cargo can also share freight capacity on Northwest's cargo  routes between the U.S. and Asia, Killian added. - Reuters Air Cargo  Service Tel+ 44 171 542 7706 Fax +5017 - www.racs.com</p>
