<p>Buenos Aires Embotelladora SA said its net worth under Argentine generally accepted accounting principles became under negative $18.7 million, and that there were potential related consequences under Argentine law.</p>
<p>BAESA is PepsiCo's biggest bottler outside the United States.</p>
<p>BAESA said it was critical that it and its creditors reach an pact to recharacterize a sufficient amount of BAESA debt for borrowed money so BAESA's net worth under Argentine GAAP was positive and enabled it to have sufficient capital in its operations.  </p>
<p>If a pact was not reached before an annual shareholder meeting expected in January 1998, BAESA said its board would have to consider which actions to take, including filing insolvency proceedings for BAESA.</p>
<p>The company previously announced it was not in compliance with certain financial covenants under various short and long term debt obligations.</p>
<p>It then negotiated a standstill agreement with certain of its major lenders which deferred principal payments on about $520 million of its unsecured debt.</p>
<p>This agreement expired on March 31 and BAESA said it was actively discussing with its lenders a long-term financial restructuring plan. ((New York newsdesk 212-859-1610))</p>
