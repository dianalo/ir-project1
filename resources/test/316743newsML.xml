<p>The rebel Sudan Peoples' Liberation Army (SPLA) said on Saturday the Sudanese governor of Kurmuk was one of the prisoners captured when the town fell to a rebel force last weekend.</p>
<p>Yassir Arman told Reuters in the Eritrean capital of Asmara: "The governor of Kurmuk has been captured. He was among the prisoners-of-war taken when we captured Kurmuk on Sunday. His name is Hussein Yacob. He was captured with some of his aides."  </p>
<p>SPLA forces, part of the opposition National Democratic Alliance, said they captured the town of Kurmuk on the Sudan-Ethiopia border last Sunday, January 12. Since then, they have claimed the capture of several Sudan army garrisons in the Southern Blue Nile area.</p>
<p>On Friday, the SPLA said the rebels would concentrate their efforts on the town of Damazin, which holds a hydro-electric plant that supplies Khartoum with most of its power.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, the rebels said they had seized control of the town of Maban. But the Sudan government rejected the claim.</p>
<p>Arman spoke on the Sudan reaction: "That is absolute rubbish. Our forces are in Maban. Either they (Sudan) are lying or they do not have command of their forces. We took Maban, and the government troops were fleeing toward Ulu and Muluth".</p>
