<headline>Apple tries to recruit Kodak's Fisher-NY Times.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-08-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Apple Computer advisor Steven Jobs has  been trying unsuccessfully to persuade Eastman Kodak Chief Executive  George Fisher to come to Apple, The New York Times said.</p>
<p>In Friday's edition, the paper cited an unnamed executive who knows  both men as the source of the information.</p>
<p>Neither Jobs nor Fisher would comment for The Times' story.</p>
<p>Jobs, who co-founded Apple, returned to the company three weeks ago  after the previous CEO departed. Though reports say he appears to  be running the company, Jobs is reported to have told friends that  he does not want the CEO position.</p>
<p>The Times said Jobs is also reportedly trying to recruit former board  members of Apple and Next Inc, including a friend, Larry Ellison,  the chairman of Oracle; John Warnock, chairman of Adobe Corp; and  Daniel Case, an investment banker at Hambrecht &amp; Quist, to fill open  positions on the Apple board.</p>
