<p>Already an over-the-counter star in Brazil, state-owned Companhia Riograndense de Telecomunicacoes S.A. (CRT) now hopes to list on the Sao Paulo bolsa.</p>
<p>"Certainly it's a goal but it won't happen in the short term. It'll be more like the medium or long term," Ocelio Ledur, CRT's market relations director, told Reuters.</p>
<p>A listing on South America's largest bourse would lend "transparency" to trade in CRT shares and improve the stock's liquidity although the company has no immediate plans to raise money with a stock issue, he said.  </p>
<p>Most analysts are sure a Rio Grande do Sul state-owned CRT listing in Sao Paulo will be successful. The company already is one of the most sought-after issues among Brazil's coveted telecoms, behind only federal giant Telebras</p>
<p>The company is already the darling of investors in Rio de Janeiro's fledgling SOMA over-the-counter market, where it regularly accounts for 65 percent of daily trade or volume totaling $8 million.  </p>
<p>Interest was sparked in CRT after a group led by Brazil's RBS and Spain's Telefonica de Espana bought a 35 percent stake last December.</p>
<p>"Everybody remembers what they (Telefonica) did with Telefonica del Peru two years ago," said analyst Maxim Medvedovsky of local bank Banco Icatu.</p>
<p>"After they bought it, it was a great investment for portfolio managers," he said.</p>
<p>CRT's preferred A share already has risen nearly 70 percent since it began trading on the SOMA on Nov 11, when it started at 80.00 reais. It closed Tuesday at 133.95 reais.  </p>
<p>While the firm remains majority state-owned, it will be operated by Telefonica and experts anticipate it will post impressive results in the coming years as it grows quickly to meet huge pent-up demand.</p>
<p>In a sign of its growing attractiveness to investors outside Brazil, U.S.-based Salomon Brothers announced Wednesday it had added CRT to its Brazilian holdings.</p>
<p>CRT posted a net profit of 19.95 million reais in 1997's first quarter, up from 9.783 million reais in the same period last year, Ledur said.</p>
<p>It ended 1996 with a 16 million-real loss mostly from non-recurring losses of 103 million reais, including a 73 million real expense related to its voluntary retirement personnel reduction plan, he added.</p>
<p>Ledur said the company expects to have installed 250,000 fixed lines and 200,000 cellular terminals this year.</p>
