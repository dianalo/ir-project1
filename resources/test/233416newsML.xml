<title>SWEDEN: SOCCER-PORTO SAIL TO EASY SWEDISH VICTORY.</title>
<headline>SOCCER-PORTO SAIL TO EASY SWEDISH VICTORY.</headline>
<dateline>GOTHENBURG, Sweden 1996-12-04</dateline>

<p>Porto, already assured a European Cup quarter-final place, refused to rest on their laurels on Wednesday and outplayed a jaded-looking Gothenburg 2-0 to underline their supremacy in Group D of the Champions' League.</p>
<p>Mario Jardel netted his fourth goal of the Champions' League series with a powerful header from a pinpoint cross from substitute Artur, a fellow Brazilian, giving international goalkeeper Thomas Ravelli no chance.</p>
<p>Artur, who replaced Fernando Mendes at halftime, played a perfect through-ball to midfielder Edmilson Pimenta one minute before the final whistle and his compatriot slotted the ball home to make it 2-0.</p>
<p>Gothenburg, who went into the game with no chance of qualifying, gave a lacklustre performance in a half-full Ullevi stadium.</p>
<p>Porto remained unbeaten in the group, with five wins in their six Champions' League matches, and now meet England's Manchester United in the quarter-finals.</p>
