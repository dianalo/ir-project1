<p>The Italian government needs to pass a 20 trillion lire supplementary budget if it wants to cut the ratio of the public sector deficit to gross domestic product to three percent and qualify for EMU membership, said a leading economic thinktank, Prometeia.</p>
<p>Angelo Tantazzi, an economist with Prometeia, gave the estimate at a hearing on public finance held by the lower chamber of parliament's budget committee.</p>
<p>The government is expected to announce the size of the mini-budget before the end of the month. Newspapers have reported that a package of 14 to 15 trillion lire worth of deficit-cutting measures is being drawn up by the treasury.</p>
<p>According to Prometeia, even taking into account that the 62.5 trillion lire 1997 budget attains most of its objectives, a further 20 trillion lire package is needed to be sure of hitting the three percent deficit-to-GDP target.</p>
<p>If the government decides to speed up some of its spending plans in the hope of boosting employment it should slow other spending programs which are seen having a lower impact on jobs, said Tantazzi.</p>
<p>Prometeia forecasts that the economy will grow by around one percent this year compared with the government's prediction of two percent growth at the time the budget was drawn up in autumn.</p>
