<p>Shares in Austrian utility Verbund dipped 0.78 percent in Vienna after the company reported a big rise in first half net profit but a 20 percent decrease in its operating result.</p>
<p>At 1138 GMT shares in Oesterreichische Elektrizitaetswirtschafts AG (Verbund) were six schillings down at 758.5 schillings on brisk turnover.</p>
<p>"Net and pre-tax profit figures look good but there are still a couple of risk factors," said a Vienna trader, pointing to the firm's long-standing Swiss franc debt position.</p>
<p>Analysts noted that operating profit had been depressed by higher fuel expenses and electricity purchase costs.</p>
<p>"That should not come as a surprise given the cold winter and low water levels," said Gerhard Auer, an analyst at ICE Securities in London.</p>
<p>He rated Verbund shares, which touched a life-high of 833 schillings earlier this year, a hold. -- Janet McBride, Vienna Newsroom 43-1-531 12 254</p>
