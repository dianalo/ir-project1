<p>The Lithuanian stock exchange is planning to launch an official share list of the best and most reliable of the country's companies, newspaper Verslo Zinios said on Friday.</p>
<p>It quoted stock market trading list and list formation head Saulius Malinauskas as saying that the exchange had already invited top companies to join.</p>
<p>He said that leading banks Vilnius Bank and Hermis Bank, brewer Kalnapilis, timber products firm Medienos Plaushas, dairy company Birzai Milk and the Rokishkis cheese manufacturer could all be included.</p>
<p>To secure a place on the list, companies must have an audit according to international standards and have share capital of at least five million litas.</p>
<p>There is no official or secondary list at the Lithuanian bourse at the moment with all companies simply split into a general corporate list, a bank list and an investment fund list.</p>
