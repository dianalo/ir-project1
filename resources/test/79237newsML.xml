<headline>August durable goods orders drop sharply.</headline>

<p>Orders for costly manufactured goods tumbled at the sharpest rate in 16 months during August, the Commerce Department said on Thursday, as demand weakened for nearly every category of product.</p>
<p>New orders for durable goods dropped 3.1 percent to a seasonally adjusted $167 billion -- the biggest monthly decline since a 3.4 percent plunge in April l995 -- after a revised 1.4 percent rise in July.</p>
<p>Economists said the report reinforced the view that the economy is slowing and seemed to support the Federal Reserve's decision this week to keep interest rates unchanged.</p>
<p>"It clearly shows that the economy is losing momentum, and that growth in the third quarter is going to come in only a fraction of what it was in the second quarter, and that the Federal Reserve was clearly right in refraining from raising interest rates the other day," said Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Chase Regional Bank.</p>
<p>"One might wonder if (Federal Reserve Board Chairman) Alan Greenspan had the number before we did." said Vincent Malanga of Lasalle Economics in New York.</p>
<p>Investors responded positively to the news, pushing the inflation-sensitive 30-year Treasury bond up 16/32, or $5.00 per $1,000 face value, and pulling its yield down to 6.89 percent from 6.93 percent Wednesday.</p>
<p>The August decline was much steeper than anticipated by Wall Street economists, who had forecast only a slight 0.1 percent fall from July.</p>
<p>Previously, the department said July durables orders had risen by 1.7 percent, but it revised that downward.</p>
<p>Virtually the only type of manufactured good that registered an orders increase last month was the volatile category of defence goods, which rose 9 percent to $5.2 billion after a 40.9 percent fall in July.</p>
<p>Excluding defence, durables orders were down 3.5 percent in August, the largest decrease since a 3.6 percent fall more than two years ago, in July 1993, after a 3.5 percent rise in July.</p>
<p>The biggest single decline in August orders occurred for transportation goods, which fell 7.9 percent to $37.9 billion, a third straight monthly decrease after drops of 1.6 percent in July and 1.3 percent in June.</p>
<p>The department said weaker orders for new aircraft and parts accounted for more than half the falloff in August transportation goods. But new-car orders also were lower than in July.</p>
<p>Orders for durable goods, items like cars and home appliances that are intended to last at least three years, can indicate the future strength of the manufacturing sector, which in turn weighs heavily on the overall economy.</p>
<p>Despite the August plunge in durables orders, the manufacturing sector has been expanding in recent months and demand for durables can fluctuate significantly from month to month.</p>
<p>Orders for primary metals were down 2.7 percent in August to $15.4 billion after a 1.6 percent July increase. Industrial machinery and equipment orders declined 0.7 percent to $32.4 billion following a 3 percent July rise.</p>
<p>Orders for electronic equipment fell 5.6 percent to $26.5 billion last month after gaining 4.9 percent in July.</p>
<p>Non-defence capital goods orders, an indicator of businesses' investment in new equipment, plummeted 10.1 percent in August after a 7.2 percent rise in July.</p>
<p>Shipments of durable goods, which measure current demand in manufacturing industries, rose 0.3 percent in August to $168.2 billion after a 0.5 percent increase in July.</p>
