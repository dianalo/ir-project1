<p>Shanghai B shares ended sharply up on Monday as local investors spilled over from the active domestic A share market, pushing volume significantly higher than last Friday brokers said.</p>
<p>The B index surged 3.178 points or 3.66 percent to 90.045 on volume of 20.75 million shares worth $14.593 million.</p>
<p>The A index soared 53.477 points or 3.99 percent to 1,395.339 points on turnover of 8.46 billion yuan.</p>
<p>Brokers said a good performance on the A share market encouraged domestic investors to buy blue-chip B shares.  </p>
<p>"Institutions were active, which boosted follow-up buying and made the market move up late in the session," one broker said.</p>
<p>"There are signs that the market has started another run-up after consolidating around 87 points for some time," another broker said. "The B share market will see 100 points this time if there is no major negative news in sight in the near future."</p>
<p>Forty-two of the 43 B share issues traded, with 28 of them up, 11 down and three unchanged.  </p>
<p>Shanghai Dazhong Taxi was the star after the firm's shareholders approved a 10-for-10 bonus issue, surging $0.168 or 10.00 percent to $1.848 on volume of 586,700 shares.</p>
<p>Pudong real estate Shanghai Jinqiao Export Processing Zone Development was the most actively traded issue. Aided by institutional buying, it rose $0.050, or 6.94 percent, to $0.770 on volume of 2.2 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai's A share index surged after a recent consolidation, helped by a lack of any new government measures to curb market speculation, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Domestic investors had been cautious on fears that market regulators would announce further measures to those already in place to cool what they see as an overheated market. A sharply expanded quota for new issues and an increase in the stock transaction duty were among the measures taken recently.</p>
<p>The SSE30 blue chip index climbed 126.967 points, or 3.21 percent, to 4,080.126 points.</p>
<p>Yunnan Baoshan Cement was the star performer on institutional speculative buying, surging 0.72 yuan or 10.06 percent to 7.87 yuan on volume of 738,600 shares.</p>
