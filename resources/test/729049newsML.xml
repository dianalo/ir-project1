<p>The Israeli shekel weakened against the dollar on Tuesday following sudden demand for the U.S. currency, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The shekel was stable most of the day and activity was low. Just before the setting of the representative rate a big customer started buying dollars," said Gideon Sadeh at Bank Leumi .</p>
<p>"The customer purchased tens of millions of dollars pushing the shekel downwards," Sadeh said.</p>
<p>But a dealer at the First International Bank of Israel said the shekel's rise was due to several big inter-bank transactions. "I do not think that it was one big deal. The decline of the shekel was the outcome of several big trades made between Israeli banks," he said.</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.5670 shekels against 3.5580 on Monday. The basket, composed of the dollar, mark, pound sterling, French franc and yen, was fixed at 3.8482 against 3.8414 on Monday.</p>
<p>On the crosses, the shekel traded against the yen at 3.1196 shekels per 100 yen compared with 3.1226 on Monday, and against the mark at 1.9870 shekels compared with 1.9862 on Monday.</p>
<p>In late afternoon, the dollar was trading at 3.5670 shekels.</p>
