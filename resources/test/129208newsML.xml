<p>Trading could one day be possible in air cargo rate futures, the president of The International Air Cargo Association (TIACA) Ram Menen told Reuters.</p>
<p>He was replying to questions after his speech opening the 18th TIACA conference here in Dubai on Sunday. The association groups air cargo leaders from the airline industry, freight forwarders and shippers.  </p>
<p>I can envisage that one day it will be possible, for instance, to buy six pallets six months in advance via an exchange," he added.  Menen is also senior general manager, cargo of Emirates Airlines.</p>
<p>"Not so long ago, it would have been beyond the bounds of our imagination to think we would all be chasing new routes and trade within tthe erstwhile Eastern bloc, within China or even South Africa and almost uunthinkable air cargo rates may become part of a commodity trading equation (but) is it so unrealistic now? " he said in his speech.  </p>
<p>"After all, Reuters now has air cargo rates on line and what is to stop us all starting to buy rates at benchmark prices," he added.</p>
<p>"We must be flexible to attack and create new markets - to participate iin the opening up of India, to adapt to the changing status of Hong Kong, to decide whether we continue to plough energy into Russia or amend our stance in the wake of the new personal import rules in that country, which nno doubt will affect trade.  Predictability is a thing of the past," Menen ssaid in his speech.</p>
<p>The air cargo industry must "support any measures aimed at reforming (world) trade procedures, making them more flexible domestically and more open internationally," he said.</p>
