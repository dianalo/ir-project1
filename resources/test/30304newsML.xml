<p>The U.S. attack on Iraq on Tuesday gave Tel Aviv Gas Mask Station 4002 something it usually does not have -- a crowd.</p>
<p>Masking their concern with sheepish smiles, dozens of Israelis rushed to the bunker-like distribution centre in an upscale neighbourhood of the city saying it was better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>"I heard the news today and I decided to come, to be prepared. It's for my children's sake," said Rivka Lavian, a 37-year-old mother of two.</p>
<p>Like many others at the army-run facility, Lavian fished out an old -- and previously ignored -- computer-generated notice to trade in old gas masks for new ones when she learned of the U.S. cruise missile attack.</p>
<p>The building, half of which houses a nursery school, is within shrapnel distance of apartment buildings badly damaged by some of the dozens of Scud missiles Iraq fired at Israel during the 1991 Gulf war.</p>
<p>Some of those waiting patiently for their turn to try on new masks feared history would repeat itself.</p>
<p>"I think there is big danger," said a woman who identified herself only as Tami.</p>
<p>Putting little faith in official Israeli statements that there was no reason for the public to be concerned, she said laconically: "The last time, it was also logical to think nothing would happen."</p>
<p>But there was no sign of any tension in Tel Aviv, which residents abandoned en masse during the Scud attacks for safe havens such as Jerusalem and the Red Sea resort of Eilat, far to the south.</p>
<p>In a radio interview, Avihu Bin-Nun, Israel's air force chief during the Gulf War, said that "even if (Iraq) has missiles...they are broken up into a hundred pieces in various places and not in any sort of system that can launch them".</p>
<p>However, Agriculture Minister Rafael Eitan, a former Israeli army chief with a reputation of shooting straight from the lip, said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein might, as a whim, decide to make Tel Aviv a target again.</p>
<p>"This is not a rational man. Why should he be bothered? What difference did it make to him to fire missiles at us in 1991?" Eitan told Israel Radio, which repeated his remarks throughout the day.</p>
<p>To deal with such contingencies, the Israeli army set up gas mask distribution stations across the country after the Gulf War. Israel has said that Syria also has long-range Scud missiles capable of carrying chemical warheads.</p>
<p>Station 4002 is open daily between 1 p.m. and 8 p.m, but soldiers at the facility said only a handful of people usually show up. On Tuesday, about 40 lined up outside in the first half-hour of operation.</p>
<p>A poster inside showed an adult in a gas mask holding a young child wearing a plastic hood connected by hose to an air pump and filter.</p>
<p>"I feel just like the way I felt the last time," said Ronen Zion, 23, referring to the Gulf War. "You can never know what will happen."</p>
