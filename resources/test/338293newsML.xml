<p>Most houses in India's capital began the new year without lights.</p>
<p>Blackouts are frequent in New Delhi and power shortages are common across the country, with peak shortage at an average 18 percent.</p>
<p>Losses during transmission and distribution of power have also contributed to the shortage.</p>
<p>"Theft of power in New Delhi, for example, is around 45 percent," says P. Abraham, the country's highest ranking civil servant in the Power Ministry.</p>
<p>Analysts warn that India's already-acute power shortfall is likely to snowball into a crisis for its core industries in the coming decade. They see no light at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>"The scenario is just going to get bleaker," says Rajesh Menon, an analyst at the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), a leading industry body.</p>
<p>SHORTAGES COST MONEY</p>
<p>Power Minister S. Venugopalachari has been quoted as saying that economists estimate that power shortages cost industry $2.7 billion annually, equivalent to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Venugopalachari told a recent conference that India needed around 100,000 megawatts (MW) of additional capacity involving an investment of some four trillion rupees ($115 billion) in the next 10 years.</p>
<p>But private investors -- seen as the key financiers -- have some qualms about putting their money in power projects due to frequent legal battles and prolonged delays which result in escalating project costs.</p>
<p>India threw open its power sector in 1991 as part of a gradual conversion to a free market economy. Investors were offered attractive terms including counter-guarantees for eight "fast track" projects.</p>
<p>Global giants including Enron, Cogentrix, Powergen and National Power took the bait.</p>
<p>"Most companies were eager to invest and signed memorandums of understanding (MoUs), but once negotiations with the states started the realities come to the fore," says CII's Menon.</p>
<p>MIDNIGHT OIL</p>
<p>More than 250 MoUs were signed for private projects which aimed to set up about 63,000 MW of generating capacity.</p>
<p>"One night in Andhra Pradesh (state in southern India), the midnight oil burned as investors signed 40 MoUs before the deadline expired," Abraham says. He says the number of projects was whittled down to 95 last year.</p>
<p>"In that euphoria many investors didn't realise a lot of things. We told them later if you are not very serious don't waste your time and our time."</p>
<p>Hurdles included erratic government policies like the withdrawal of subsequent counter-guarantees, delays in obtaining clearances and differences between the federal and state governments. Project risks were high and it was difficult to attract international funds.</p>
<p>"Then there's the political factor. We are very prone to changing our view with every change of guard," said Swarup Choudhury, Bombay-based manager for corporate finance at HSBC Investment Banking.</p>
<p>ENRON'S WOES</p>
<p>U.S.-based Enron's 2,450 MW project in the western Indian state of Maharashtra was scrapped in August 1995 after a right-wing state coalition swept to power. The project had been cleared by the previous Congress government.</p>
<p>After prolonged negotiations and legal battles, Enron recently announced it was resuming work on the project.</p>
<p>The case of U.S. firm Cogentrix -- which is building a 1,000 MW plant in a joint venture with a unit of China Light and Power Co Ltd -- will be heard in court later this month. Cogentrix is fighting a demand that its project be halted on environmental grounds.</p>
<p>Abraham said frequent public interest litigation was one factor which dissuaded global private investments.</p>
<p>"People do not come to India to go to court and meet lawyers. They come here to put their project and make money. Enron has gone through 22 cases," Abraham said.</p>
<p>"It's a mixed scenario...We are no longer as bullish as we were because of the lopsidedness of the government," Choudhury said.</p>
<p>OBSTACLES TO INVESTMENT</p>
<p>The World Bank in its annual country report last year said the weak financial position of state electricity boards (SEBs) -- which control nearly 70 percent of generating capacity and operate virtually all the country's distribution networks -- was an obstacle to private investment in the sector.</p>
<p>"At this time, the SEBs are not financially viable clients for potential private power producers," it said.</p>
<p>Restructuring the lumbering SEBs would involve slashing power subsidies to agriculture and hiking public power rates -- hard decisions that Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's 13-party coalition would be loath to take.</p>
<p>"Unless the electricity boards are made financially viable, and they are made bankable we will see only limited investment from the private sector," agrees Abraham.</p>
<p>The country's eighth five-year plan from 1992 to 1997 had projected a capacity addition of 30,538 MW. But Abraham says the country is likely add only about 18,000 MW.</p>
<p>"We are going to start the ninth plan (1997-2002) with a shortfall of about 12,000 MW," he says.</p>
<p>Abraham says the need-based requirement of installed capacity during the ninth plan is around 57,000 MW.</p>
<p>"This certainly appears to be highly optimistic," he conceeds. "If we can get anywhere around 35,000-40,000 MW we should consider that a major achievement."</p>
<p>CAPTIVE POWER</p>
<p>CII's Menon says one result of the shortfall is that industry is going in for captive power.</p>
<p>Delhi-based sponge iron maker Jindal Strips did just that. The firm set up its own 75 MW captive plant in Madhya Pradesh state in an attempt to fight the shortage and produce cheaper power through the waste heat recovery method.</p>
<p>"Availability is quite a problem and everyone who sets up an industry unit now thinks of producing their own power because they can't rely on the SEB," said Rajesh Bhatia, AGM Finance at Jindal Strips.</p>
<p>But captive power is not the solution.</p>
<p>"Not everyone can afford the investment. Besides, it's a different business altogether. Your core business is not to generate power and if you have someone you can rely on for power which is cost-effective, that's the best solution," he says.</p>
