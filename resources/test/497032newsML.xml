<title>USA: CSCE world sugar ends sharply up amid fund buying.</title>
<headline>CSCE world sugar ends sharply up amid fund buying.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-09</dateline>

<p>Fund buying lifted CSCE world sugar futures to a settlement just below six-month highs made earlier in the day amid heavy, technically-driven activity, floor sources said.</p>
<p>The benchmark-May contract rose to 11.36 cents, its highest level since reaching 11.37 on September 13, before easing back slightly by the close to end at 11.31, up 0.27, while the outer months finished 0.26 to 0.07 firmer.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at a brisk 55,537 lots compared with Tuesday's official 21,831 lots. The funds and the speculators were cited as the day's major buyers and the trade as an early seller.</p>
<p>Market sources said a series of buy stops were elected early, sending the market to resistance at a gap on the charts between 11.36 and 11.38 cents basis May.</p>
<p>The fundamental news remains negative. Besides an ongoing dearth of physical interest, Mexico said today that it expects to export close to 600,000 tonnes of sugar in 1997, out of a record 4.4 million-tonne harvest. The harvest is a five percent increase over the previous crop.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, "the Russians aren't buying and the Chinese aren't buying," Anne Prendergast, an analyst with Refco, said.</p>
<p>She added that the speculators have spent the last six sessions pushing May towards resistance around 11.10 cents.</p>
<p>"Once the specs built a base they had a technical incentive to use it," she said.</p>
<p>Analysts expect the May contract to ease back towards 11.00 cents by Friday, since open interest in May 11.00 calls remains high ahead of options expiry.</p>
<p>Open interest in May futures rose 734 lots to 61,061 lots, as of Monday's close.</p>
