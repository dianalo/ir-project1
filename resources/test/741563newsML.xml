<p>Taiwan's fledgling over-the-counter stock market has big ambitions -- it takes the Nasdaq as a role model and hopes someday to surpass the giant high-tech U.S. exchange.</p>
<p>Given the securities exchange's blazing growth in recent years, the goal is not completely out of reach.</p>
<p>Before the OTC exchange inaugurated a computerised trading system in 1994, it comprised a mere 11 listings mired in a backwater of illiquidity with average daily turnover of just T$2 million (US$71,600).</p>
<p>Today, the eight-year-old OTC has 96 listed companies.</p>
<p>Turnover averages well over T$10 billion ($358 million). That's five times Japan's over-the-counter turnover and rivals some of the world's major national exchanges, though it is only a tenth of Taiwan's main exchange, where daily turnover regularly tops T$200 billion (US$7.2 billion).</p>
<p>The OTC's turnover hit a record T$20 billion ($716 million) several times in July.</p>
<p>OTC market capitalisation has soared to T$270 billion ($9.68 billion) from a puny T$4.2 billion ($151 million) in 1994.</p>
<p>"I believe such stunning growth is second to none in the world. The record is unprecedented," says Chao Hsiao-feng, chairman of the Taiwan Over-the-Counter Securities Exchange.</p>
<p>"This is a young market with unlimited upside potential," Chao told Reuters in a recent interview.</p>
<p>NASDAQ-STYLE HIGH-TECH FOCUS</p>
<p>Chao said such potential lies mainly with the island's hundreds, perhaps thousands, of promising but little-known electronics firms -- the hottest sector in Taiwan's economy.</p>
<p>As the government vows to turn Taiwan into a "technology island", the OTC aims to become a Nasdaq-style exchange that actively fosters futuristic high-technology development.</p>
<p>Fewer than one-third of OTC-listed firms now are in the electronics business, but Chao is confident that high-tech listings will expand rapidly.</p>
<p>By the end of 1997, around 150 firms -- many in the electronics sector -- will be traded in the OTC, with a further 110 firms being screened for listings, he added.</p>
<p>"Our people make door-to-door calls to small and medium companies, especially high-technology ones, around the island to encourage their interest in listing on the OTC," Chao said.</p>
<p>"Maybe one day what now is a little-known, small company will grow and prosper in the OTC market -- just like Microsoft did in the Nasdaq," Chao said.</p>
<p>"One day, we hope our exchange can surpass Nasdaq."</p>
<p>Allan Huang, fund manager for Taiwan's first OTC-only closed-end fund, said the exchange is heading in the right direction.</p>
<p>"We think it's the right approach to follow the Nasdaq model and make the OTC market the cradle of Taiwan's high-technology firms," said Huang, of Taiwan's Foremost Investment Services.</p>
<p>"In the future, electronics will be the dominant sector in the OTC market, replacing securities and banking shares. Once this becomes the case, it will significantly boost the interest of foreign investors," Huang said.</p>
<p>FOREIGN INTEREST SEEN GROWING</p>
<p>Until now, foreign investors have shown limited interest in Taiwan's junior market, seen by foreign fund managers as lacking the critical mass of Taiwan's big exchange -- and therefore vulnerable to manipulation.</p>
<p>Analysts estimate that the OTC exchange has attracted less than four percent, or about T$10 billion (US$358 million), of foreigners' total Taiwan stock investments.</p>
<p>"Illiquidity has been a main concern," said Oliver Fang, head of institutional sales at National Securities.</p>
<p>"Professional foreign institutions normally have a standard evaluation formula to help them make investment decisions. When they apply the formula to companies in Taiwan's OTC, not many qualify," Fang said.</p>
<p>"Many are too small and can be manipulated easily."</p>
<p>Companies that are capitalised at as little as T$50 million ($1.79 million) and show even modest profitability are eligible to apply for OTC listing.</p>
<p>By contrast, the main stock exchange requires capitalisation of T$200 million ($7.17 million) for main-board high-tech shares and T$300 million ($10.75 million) for others.</p>
<p>OTC FIRMS SMALL BUT SOUND</p>
<p>Chairman Chao counters that small firms, too, can have sound financials and says his exchange uses strict criteria to ensure no laggards qualify. What's more, he said, small companies have far greater potential to grow compared to big firms.</p>
<p>"We believe a company's performance depends not on its size, but on whether its structure is healthy and solid," he said.</p>
<p>In the OTC's brief history only one company, Cheng-I Food, was forced to suspend trading due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>"Cheng-I was a rare case," Chao added.</p>
<p>Rules enacted in July allow the market to downgrade troubled firms before delisting them, mollifying critics who had said its old, instant-delisting rule was unfair to investors and a barrier to healthy development.</p>
<p>Huang of Foremost said he expected more institutional investors -- foreign and domestic alike -- to participate in the OTC to tap the market's rapid expansion.</p>
<p>"With market scale expanding and liquidity increasing, the long-term profit outlook in the OTC market is very, very promising," Huang said. (US$1 =T$27.9)</p>
