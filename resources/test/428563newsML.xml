<headline>Disney World workers file discrimination suit.</headline>

<p>Four employees at Walt Disney World filed a lawsuit Friday against the entertainment giant accusing Walt Disney Co. of racial discrimination.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, four African-American employees working at the company's Florida theme park or related hotels or resorts were denied the opportunity for promotions, raises and bonuses that are typically given to white employees.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, which is seeking class action status, also claims Disney retaliates against African-American employees by "intimidating and threatening them, diminishing their work responsibilites and terminating their employment."</p>
<p>"Disney's retaliation policy is well known and feared by its African-American employees," the lawsuit said. "Disney uses this pattern of retaliation to intimidate its employees and deter them from asserting civil rights claims based on Disney's practices, inbcluding those relating to promotion, hiring and work assignments."</p>
<p>The lawsuit seeks unspecified punitive and compensatory damages.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Disney said the company had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment on it.</p>
