<headline>US corporate debt trade thin, Marvels' talked down.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Strength in U.S. Treasury bonds was not enough to incite response from holiday-staffed high-yield or investment-grade corporate bond desks on Friday and dealers across both markets dubbed the session a non-event.</p>
<p>A bankruptcy filing by Marvel Entertainment Group Inc's holding companies early on Friday was fodder for talk, however, with some prices quoted off about three points following the news.  </p>
<p>Marvel blamed bondholders for an impasse in a restructuring proposal that called for waivers to certain restriction on the bonds. Under the proposal, investor Ron Perelman's Andrews Group would buy newly issues shares of Marvel at a steep discount to the market price, thereby diluting current shares and devaluing equity-backed bonds.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, Andrews Group said it signed a definitive merger agreement with Toy Biz, which is dependent on Marvel's reorganization.</p>
<p>Standard &amp; Poor's cut Marvel's holding companies' debt ratings to single-D from single-C, citing the bankruptcy.  </p>
<p>Beyond the Marvel story, high-yielders were said to be firmly bid thanks to a report of another solid week of cash inflows to mutual funds. Inflows totaled $310 million for the week ended Wednesday as measured by AMG Data Services, a source said.</p>
<p>An AMG official would not comment on the statistic.</p>
<p>Commerce for investment grade debt was equally quiet and the lack of activity left spreads across all sectors flat on the week, traders said. Prices tracked strength in U.S. Treasuries following some foreign central bank buying and the release of a surprisingly weak durable goods report.</p>
<p>The U.S. Commerce Department said durable goods fell 1.6 percent in November against an upwardly revised 0.5 percent gain in October. Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a slight rise in November.</p>
<p>Volume was extremely thin.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year bond was quoted up 19/32 at 99-15/32 to yield 6.54 percent at 1630 EST/2130 GMT.</p>
