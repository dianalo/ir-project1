<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Boise Cascade upgraded.</headline>
<text>
<p>- Jensen Securities upgraded Boise Cascade Corp to neutral from underperform after the company announced plans to sell its coated paper business to Mead Corp for $650 million, analyst Steven Dietrich said.</p>
<p>- Some of the sale proceeds will be used to pay down Boise Cascade debt, which could boost the company's net income by $0.25 to $0.30 a share annually, Dietrich estimated.</p>
<p>- Dietrich also said he thought the worst was over for Boise's partly owned subsidiary Boise Cascade Office Products Corp, which has fallen to 17-1/2 from 49-1/2 in May.  </p>
<p>- Pending completion of the sale, Jensen left unchanged its estimates that Boise Cascade will lose $0.50 a share this year and earn a profit of $0.50 a share next year.</p>
<p>- Boise Cascade was up 1-1/4 at 33-5/8.</p>
