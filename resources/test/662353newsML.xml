<p>Israel's High Court on Sunday rejected a petition demanding that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu be indicted for fraud in a decision his aides said closed the door on a six-month government corruption scandal.</p>
<p>Four judges on the five-member panel refused to overrule a decision by state prosecutors not to charge Netanyahu in the affair that threatened to topple his government.</p>
<p>But in a minority opinion which could generate further criticism of Netanyahu, one judge wanted to issue an injunction ordering the state attorney to show cause for his decision not to indict the prime minister.</p>
<p>"The majority opinion is based on the principle that the court does not intervene in decisions of the state attorney unless they are extremely unreasonable," High Court Justice Yitzhak Zamir told the court, in the ruling on a petition by opposition legislators.</p>
<p>The judges also rejected petitions demanding that Justice Minister Tsahi Hanegbi be indicted or sacked.</p>
<p>Israeli police recommended in April that both Netanyahu and Hanegbi be charged with fraud and breach of trust in the short-lived appointment of lawyer Roni Bar-On as attorney-general last January.</p>
<p>Israel's Channel One Television had alleged Bar-On's appointment was part of a deal to win a plea bargain for key coalition legislator Aryeh Deri of the religious Shas party in his three-year corruption trial.</p>
<p>But state prosecutors on April 20 said there was sufficient evidence to indict only Deri.</p>
<p>"The minority decision is that the evidence collected in this affair, and the importance of the matter, justify issuing a temporary injunction concerning the decision not to indict the prime minister," Justice Dalia Dorner wrote in her decision.</p>
<p>Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein said the police case against Netanyahu was based on testimony of one witness which he said was insufficient for bringing charges.</p>
<p>Deri has denied all accusations. Bar-On, who quit 12 hours after taking office amid a public outcry that he was unqualified for the job, was cleared by prosecutors.</p>
<p>"This affair has come to an end and justice has been served," said Netanyahu's spokesman, Shai Bazak.</p>
<p>But opposition legislators seized on Dorner's minority opinion and predicted the affair would continue dogging Netanyahu.</p>
<p>"This means 20 percent of the panel thought this prime minister should stand trial. I think today the countdown has begun for Benjamin Netanyahu's rule," said Yossi Beilin of the main opposition Labour party, adding that the decision was a political "earthquake".</p>
<p>The lawyer for a citizens' watchdog group behind one of the petitions said an appeal was unlikely.</p>
<p>"This is virtually the end of the line. There's not much more we can do," said attorney Ido Shapira.</p>
<p>At a hearing last month, the five-judge panel threw out several related petitions including a request to order a state investigation into the allegations and one to make public the 995-page police report on the affair.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has apologised for any mistakes in the Bar-On appointment, but accused the media and opposition of trying to use the affair to overthrow the government.</p>
