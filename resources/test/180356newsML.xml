<p>A gaucho or cowboy of the Argentine Pampas rode a horse 12,000 miles (19,000 kms) to Washington, D.C. -- it took him three years and five months.</p>
<p>Hugo Gassioles survived freezing Andean passes, Colombian guerrilla warfare, mosquito-infested Panamanian jungle and traffic-clogged Texas highways to reach the U.S. capital, the Washington Post reported.</p>
<p>He said he got lost in a Peruvian desert, was almost shipwrecked in the Gulf of Panama and had to trade his watch for a meal because he was so broke at one point.</p>
<p>Gassioles, 28, who is seeking to raise money for children with Down syndrome, hopes to crown his odyssey with a mounted promenade down New York's Fifth Avenue.</p>
