<p>Former Sen. William Cohen on Friday was sworn in as U.S. defence secretary, becoming the first Republican member of President Bill Clinton's Cabinet.</p>
<p>Clinton, who looked on proudly as Vice President Al Gore administered the oath to Cohen in an Oval Office ceremony, said the Pentagon's new civilian boss embodied the bipartisan spirit that should mark the shaping of defence policy.  </p>
<p>"Throughout his years as a senator and a congressman, he has reached across the divisions of party to strengthen our defences," said Clinton. He added that Cohen has always put the nation's soldiers first.</p>
<p>Cohen, a 24-year veteran of Congress from Maine, is regarded as an expert on arms control issues. He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In his remarks, the new defence secretary assured members of the U.S. armed forces that he would do his best to maintain a strong military. "We cannot become the world's policeman, but neither can we ever afford to become the prisoner of events," Cohen said.</p>
