<headline>Deutsche Telekom sets high IPO range.</headline>
<dateline>BONN, Germany</dateline>
<text>
<p>Europe's largest ever stock issue, the partial privatisation of German phone giant Deutsche Telekom, will be offered to investors at a price ranging from 25 to 30 German marks ($16.25 to $19.60) a share, the company said on Monday.</p>
<p>Backed by overwhelming demand from German private investors, Deutsche Telekom over the weekend convinced banks managing the deal to set the price at the high end of analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>More than 3 million Germans have already signed up to buy "T-shares."</p>
<p>"We have succeeded with the marketing surrounding the T-share over the past weeks and months of stirring up real "stock fever" in Germany," Telekom Chairman Ron Sommer told a news conference at the company's headquarters here.</p>
<p>That demand boosted trading in the so-called "grey market" for Telekom shares -- in which brokers deal ahead of the stock issue -- where the price peaked early Monday at 39 marks ($25.50) before settling back to 35 marks ($22.90) by the end of the day.</p>
<p>Up to 67 percent of the IPO will be placed in Germany. As much as 18 percent will be sold in the United States, Canada and Latin America. Twelve percent will go to British investors, while Europe and Asia will each be offered up to 8 percent.</p>
<p>The final price for Telekom shares will be set during the weekend of Nov. 16 and 17.</p>
<p>The German government will remain Telekom's majority shareholder until the year 2000.</p>
