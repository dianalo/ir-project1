<p>Spot bulk electricity prices in the northeastern U.S. held mostly steady Thursday versus Wednesday's level as a cold snap continued its grip on the region.</p>
<p>This week's price rise was capped by forecasts calling for temperatures to moderate from recent lows by early next week.</p>
<p>"It looks like there's a warming trend next week," said one New York trader.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, scattered snowfall and frigid weather were anticipated to continue for the next several days.</p>
<p>For Friday, the Northeast's temperatures were predicted to peak in the 20s-30s Fahrenheit and to bottom in single digits to the teens. Snowfall in western New York was expected to end late today.</p>
<p>In the western part of the New York Power Pool (NYPP) district, peak, non-firm electricity for Friday delivery was quoted at $23.00-$25.00 a megawatt hour (MWh), compared with Wednesday's quote near $25.00 for Thursday delivery.</p>
<p>Western NYPP power for non-firm delivery during light load hours on Friday was again assessed near $15.00.</p>
<p>In the eastern part of NYPP, peak, non-firm electricity for Friday was valued at $31.00-$32.00, a tighter range than Wednesday's $30.00-$32.00 for Thursday.</p>
<p>Off-peak, non-firm Friday electricity in eastern NYPP was assessed at $17.00-$18.50, lower than Wednesday's range of $18.00-$20.00.</p>
<p>In the New England Power Pool (NEPOOL), peak, non-firm electricity for Friday at the Northeast Utilities border was valued at $36.00-$37.00, down from $38.00-$39.00 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Non-firm, off-peak NEPOOL power for next-day delivery to the NU border remained in the $20.00-$21.00 range.</p>
