<p>Japanese government bond (JGB) futures are likely to head higher on Thursday after healthy overnight gains in London trade as sentiment gradually improves, traders said.</p>
<p>Wednesday statements from a key Japanese Lower House member and opposition politician that Japan should not raise interest rates this year are expected to give bonds an additional boost.</p>
<p>"Virtually everyone now feels no interest rate rise is likely before September, but saying that no hike is likely within the year or fiscal year is relatively new and will contribute to positive sentiment," one trader said.  </p>
<p>While U.S. bonds suffered some losses overnight on profit-taking, traders said this was unlikely to stand in the way of bonds in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Although the market is watching to see how much investor buying of the 10-year government bonds auctioned on Wednesday takes place, the fact that results were fairly positive will continue to keep bonds underpinned today.</p>
<p>Wednesday's break above the key chart point of 125.50 has cleared the way, technically, for further rises, and traders said that key September now has 126.00 in its sights, although rises that far today may be difficult.  </p>
<p>"Selling is likely to emerge from 125.80 on up, as 126.00 is fairly strong resistance," one trust bank trader said.</p>
<p>He added that the expected launch of two tranches of straight bonds by East Japan Railway Co (JR East) today may weigh on the topside. JR East is planning to launch 40 billion yen worth of 12-year bonds and 30 billion yen worth of 20-year bonds.</p>
