<p>President Clinton's advisers have come up with recommendations for filling two Federal Reserve Board vacancies, and the recommendations are about to go to the president, the White House said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The last I heard the recommendations were about to be made to the president," White House spokesman Mike McCurry said.</p>
<p>Another White House official said the recommendations had not yet reached Clinton's desk.</p>
<p>Clinton was to nominate replacements for Janet Yellen, who left the Fed to chair his Council of Economic Advisers, and Laurence Lindsey, who is joining a conservative think tank.</p>
<p>Among those considered possible candidates to replace them are banker Joseph Bracewell, lawyer Douglas Harris. Speculation has also focused on bankers James Annable, Lynn Reaser, Sung Won Sohn and John Wilson.</p>
