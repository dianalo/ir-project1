<p>Europe's socialists on Thursday endorsed an Irish draft EU treaty that aims at the 15-country bloc's further integration and eventual addition of new members.</p>
<p>The Party of European Socialists, the largest political grouping in the European Union, met for its traditional eve of summit meeting in Dublin and welcomed the Irish paper as a worthy base for future negotiations.</p>
<p>"We have discussed all the issues on the agenda for tomorrow...and I hope that we can have an agreement tomorrow," Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring told reporters.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the group said the meeting, which included five EU prime ministers who will discuss the bloc's future at an EU summit over the next two days, gave "fulsome praise" to the Irish draft.</p>
<p>"They said it was a very good basis for the work that has to be done over the next six months," he said, adding that the group was particularly impressed with the employment chapter, which aims to fight joblessness and create work Europe-wide.</p>
<p>"We discussed the Irish draft at length which was viewed very favourably, with a heavy emphasis on employment," John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) leader, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The negotiations, under the ongoing inter-governmental conference, are scheduled to lead to a thorough review of the Treaty of Maastricht at the Amsterdam summit in June.</p>
<p>The key elements of the Irish draft are enlargement, a single currency, increased cooperation to fight crime and a border-free bloc with common immigration policies.</p>
<p>The socialist and social democrat grouping, currently in power in 11 of the 15 EU states, believes employment is "by far the best possible answer to the poverty and social marginalisation of millions of EU citizens.</p>
<p>The group meets to adopt a common position ahead of all major European events.</p>
