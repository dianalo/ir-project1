<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said on Sunday the planned expansion of the European Union to include new members from the east was in the interests of all 15 current EU members.</p>
<p>"Every previous EU expansion round has shown -- the enlarged community has led to increases in well-being for all," Kinkel said in a statement.</p>
<p>Kinkel admitted expansion would bring problems of adjustment, risks and costs, but said the chances and advantages clearly outweighed these.</p>
<p>"Expansion eastwards, alongside economic and monetary union (EMU) is the strategic challenge for the European Union on the cusp of the 21st century," he said.</p>
<p>The European Commission will soon publish long-awaited advice to EU governments on how suitable 10 eastern countries are for the rigours of EU membership.</p>
<p>It is expected to say Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovenia and Estonia fit the bill. REUTER</p>
