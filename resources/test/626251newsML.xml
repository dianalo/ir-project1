<p>South Africa's 1.9 million strong Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) said on Friday a national strike called for Monday would go ahead with marches planned in all nine provinces around the country.</p>
<p>"It's going ahead. There is no way now the June 2 strike can be stopped because we have met all the requirements for a legal strike," Cosatu spokeswoman Nowetu Mpati told Reuters.</p>
<p>Cosatu called the 24-hour protest action over the Basic Conditions of Employment Bill which has threatened to become a flashpoint between trade unions and business.</p>
<p>The action is expected to impact on the entire economy, including factories, mines and transport.</p>
<p>The bill, approved by cabinet in April, stipulates a 45 hour working week and four months maternity leave. Cosatu is demanding a 40 hour work week, six months maternity leave and the minimum age for formal employment to be set at 18.</p>
<p>An impasse has been reached between labour, business and government in the statutory National Economic Development and Labour Council (Nedlac) negotiating forum.</p>
<p>The Labour Department's minimum standards director, Lisa Seftel, said in parliament this week talks were continuing. She gave no details but, asked if differences could be resolved before June 2, replied: "Anything is possible in negotiations."</p>
<p>However, Mpati said Cosatu was unwilling to compromise its stance and wanted concessions from business and government.</p>
<p>"While we are committed to reaching a solution to the impasse, as Cosatu we have reached our bottom line. We are the ones who have been compromising since the negotiations began.</p>
<p>"We are keenly waiting for business and government to initiate another leg of negotiations once they have consulted their principles and can come back with new mandates," Mpati said.</p>
<p>The working week in South Africa ranges from about 39 to 40 hours in the most organised industries. In agriculture and mining the norm is 48 hours while security workers work up to 60 hours a week.</p>
<p>Cosatu last called a nationwide strike in April 1996 to protest against business' eventually unsuccessful bid for a lockout clause to be entrenched in the constitution.</p>
