<p>An Iraqi diplomat attended the opening of Bahrain's new Shura council in the first official appearance by a Baghdad envoy in the Gulf state since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, sources close to the council said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said the attendance of Iraqi charge d'affaires Ahmed al-Taef at the recently appointed council's opening session on Tuesday indicated warming relations between Baghdad and Manama.</p>
<p>"It is the first time an Iraqi official has attended an official ceremony in Bahrain in six years," said a source, who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>Baghdad's relations with Gulf Arab states were soured by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.</p>
<p>Iran's charge d'affaires Sayyed Mohammed Ahmadi also attended the Shura meeting, which was formally opened by the Emir Sheikh Isa bin Sulman al-Khalifa, the sources said.</p>
<p>Bahrain in June accused the Islamic republic of supporting a Shi'ite Moslem-led plot to topple the government by force. It expelled an Iranian diplomat and downgraded relations. Tehran denied the charges.</p>
