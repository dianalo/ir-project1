<p>The Tokyo Grain Exchange (TGE) said on Wednesday it is considering revising the delivery rule for the corn futures contract, shortening the notice period.</p>
<p>The move is in response to requests from local trade houses and feed makers. "We're considering shortening the corn contract's delivery notice period, for example," a TGE spokesman said.</p>
<p>No date has been mentioned as of yet, he said. Corn has been the most actively traded commodity contract in Japan this year, as local speculators have shifted money away from other contracts.</p>
