<p>Marks &amp; Spencer Plc said on Thursday it has targeted Australia in its development plans and would start looking for franchise partners early in 1997.</p>
<p>"Following a lengthy feasibility study, we have decided to enter the Australian market, concentrating initially on Sydney," deputy chairman Keith Oates said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company also said it believed franchising, rather than owning stores, was the best entry strategy.</p>
<p>It now trades in 31 countries globally and has 34 stores in the Asia-Pacific, its statement said.</p>
