<p>The director-general of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), Renato Ruggiero, told a news conference on Friday that he thought negotiations with China on its entry into the world trade body were "approaching the final stages".  </p>
<p>Ruggiero said all parties involved, including China, did not want to give any specific timeframe for its possible entry into the world trade body.</p>
<p>He said that the parties would continue to negotiate in the positive spirit they had shared in the last session which was a "very encouraging one".</p>
<p>However, he added: "It seems to me that we are approaching the final stages of negotiations."</p>
<p>The chief of the world trade body is in Tokyo for weeklong meetings with government officials and business leaders.  </p>
<p>Concerning Taiwan's wish to join the WTO, he said its prospects were "encouraging" and much progress had been made.</p>
<p>However, he said there were still hurdles for Taiwan to overcome, but he did not say what they were.</p>
<p>Ruggiero said talks with China and Taiwan were separate issues.</p>
<p>On Russia's desire to join the body, he said: "There is strong will from everyone in the WTO to conclude negotiations as soon as possible."</p>
<p>In regard to the desire of many countries to have Russia as a member of the WTO and for the organisation to make the application process quicker for all candidates, he said: "We can be optimistic that 'as soon as possible' will mean something positive."  </p>
<p>He reiterated his view that there will no changes in the relationship between Hong Kong and the WTO even after the British colony reverts to Chinese rule in the coming months.</p>
<p>Ruggiero said he based that view on the fact he had not received any comment from Hong Kong or China on that issue.</p>
