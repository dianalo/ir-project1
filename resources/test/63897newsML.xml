<p>The National Bank of Romania (BNR) said it had raised the minimum permitted rate on its one-week refinancing funds to 51 percent from 49 percent last week.</p>
<p>Traders took the move as a sign of the BNR's intention to slightly tighten its monetary policy to prop up the leu currency ahead of dollar hoarding which is common in winter.</p>
<p>The BNR's offer at Thursday's auction stayed unchanged at 500 billion lei. Auction results will be displayed on  FXRP later on Thursday or early on Friday.</p>
<p>At last week's refinancing auction the one-week rate rose to 58.4 percent from a previous 52.75 following a heavy oversubscription of central bank funds. -- Bucharest Newsroom 40-1 3120264</p>
