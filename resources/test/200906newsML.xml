<p>German construction group Holzmann AG said on Tuesday it had now completed the sale of some 4,000 apartments, part of a property portfolio on which the group was in 1995 forced to make huge write-downs.</p>
<p>Holzmann said the sale, for which it gave no price, "strengthened the financial situation and capital structure of the group".</p>
<p>The company, which is undergoing a deep restructuring of its business, said that the proceeds would counterbalance the majority of charges due in the 1996 book-year.</p>
<p>Holzmann said earlier this month it had found an unnamed buyer for the apartments, most of which were built in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
<p>The group made losses of 443 million marks in 1995 following huge write-downs for losses on real estate projects.</p>
