<p>Australia on Friday appointed career diplomat Penny Wensley as its new ambassador to the United Nations -- the first time Australia has appointed a woman to the post.</p>
<p>Wensley takes up her new job in early September, replacing Richard Butler, now U.N. inspector of Iraqi weapons, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said in a statement.</p>
<p>Wensley's appointment is the most senior overseas Australian posting so far given to a woman.</p>
<p>Wensley was Australia's ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations in Geneva from 1993-96 and has also worked in Paris, Mexico City, Wellington and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>She has led more than 50 Australian delegations to international meetings and conferences and held several U.N. posts.</p>
<p>"Ms Wensley's extensive experience in bilateral, regional and multilateral diplomacy will equip her admirably in hew new role as the United Nations undergoes important changes to its role in international peace and security, in economic and social issues and humanitarian affairs and development," Downer said.</p>
