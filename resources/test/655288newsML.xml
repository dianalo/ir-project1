<p>Finnish-Norwegian joint venture Baltic Beverages Holding (BBH) said on Wednesday it was in discussions on possibly buying parts of Lithuanian brewer Utenos Beverages.</p>
<p>But the company denied a report by Lithuanian newspaper Verslo Zinios that a bid had been made.</p>
<p>"There are discussions, but we have not made a bid," said Goeran Orre, spokesman for Pripps Ringnes.</p>
<p>BBH is owned jointly by Finland's Hartwall and Pripps Ringnes, part of Norway's Orkla .</p>
<p>Orre said it was not even certain that BBH would bid for Utenos.</p>
<p>"We have been operating in these markets for many years and learned that discussions can go on for a long time. We don't know for sure today if we are going to make a bid," Orre told Reuters.</p>
<p>The newspaper quoted the president of BBH, Henrik Therman, as saying his company would like to buy 50 percent or less in Utenos Beverages and thereby invest $20 million in the company.</p>
<p>"300 litas for a share (with face value of 100 litas) is a respectable price," Therman was quoted as saying.</p>
