<p>The collapse of a small New Zealand airline on Monday with the loss of 250 jobs put the focus on a slew of recent large shutdowns likely to hurt the conservative government five weeks before a general election.</p>
<p>Kiwi International Airlines went into liquidation as it succumbed to competition and unlucky breaks, from mechanical faults to volcanic eruptions, which played havoc with flights.</p>
<p>"The timing is certainly bad news for the government," said Canterbury University political scientist John Henderson.</p>
<p>Confectioner Arnotts said last week it was moving its biscuit-making operation to Australia, shedding 230 jobs in Auckland. Last month animal eartag manufacturer Allflex, often cited by politicians as a model New Zealand operation, relocated 130 manufacturing jobs overseas.</p>
<p>That followed hard on the heels of another New Zealand success story, Cedenco Foods, transferring its tomato paste operations to Australia and chopping 500 full-time and seasonal jobs in Gisborne, a rural area with heavy unemployment.</p>
<p>The National Party government, together with the independent Reserve Bank, has won international praise for running an apparently model free-market economy and its success there is likely to be a major campaign plank, said Henderson.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Bill Birch has trumpeted budget surpluses, low inflation, debt repayment and tax cuts as examples of National's success in managing the economy.</p>
<p>"These types of closures are not helpful for that overall theme...if business is relocating to Australia or closing down, that's bad news," Henderson said.</p>
<p>"We have been led to believe we have set up the perfect economy here, that we are ahead of Australia, yet firms are relocating. That does not look good."</p>
<p>Polls shows National has the strongest support, with around 35 percent, but opposition parties on the centre and left have over 50 percent and could form a government if they could agree to do so.</p>
<p>The economic nationalist New Zealand First Party and the left-wing Alliance both want to trim the Reserve Bank's independence and broaden its objectives beyond just price stability to include growth and employment targets.</p>
<p>Economists said the closures were an indirect result of tight monetary conditions for nearly two years as the Reserve Bank fights to get inflation back within its 0-2 percent target.</p>
<p>Many firms have had to grapple with high real interest rates and a steeply appreciating exchange rate.</p>
<p>"It's the downside of the tight discipline we have," said Infometrics economist Philip Wrigley.</p>
<p>"We've had an economic slowdown under way for quite a while and to some extent you have to expect a certain amount of bad news," he said. "These things do bite."</p>
<p>However, he pointed out that the latest figures for the June quarter suggested net job creation was still taking place at a surprisingly high rate despite the tight conditions.</p>
