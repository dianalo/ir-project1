<p>Tunisia on Monday merged the Maghreb and African affairs departments at the foreign ministry.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hamed Karoui announced that President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali had named Sadok Fayala, Secretary of State (junior minister) for African Affairs, as secretary of state for Maghreb and African affairs.</p>
<p>No official reason was given but the change coincides with reports from Rabat that the Arab Maghreb Union was cutting its staff because it was largely paralysed since 1995 because of political differences between its members on issues such as the Western Sahara.</p>
<p>The union was created in 1989 with the idea of forming an economic grouping between Tunisia, Morocco, Algeria, Libya and Mauritania.</p>
<p>Last week the secretary of state for Maghreb Affairs, Said Ben Mustapha, was named ambassador to Italy.</p>
