<p>Argentine steelmaker SIDERAR SAIC announced Tuesday that it had bought 100 percent of the shares of local flat galvanized steel firm Comesi for $65 million.</p>
<p>"The acquisition is made in line with SIDERAR's strategy to complement the company's current painted products outupt," SIDERAR told the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange in a letter.  </p>
<p>It added that the acquisition aimed to offer the housing, commercial, industrial and agribusiness building sectors a complete scope of high added value products made under an integrated industrial scheme.</p>
<p>Comesi, with facilities in the province of Buenos Aires, has a galvanizad flat steel output capacity of 150,000 tonnes per year and painted flat steel output capacity of 20,000 tonnes per year, SIDERAR said.</p>
<p>Mexican steel and industrial company Grupo Imsa SA de CV announced previously on Tuesday that it has sold its 26 percent stake in Comesi to SIDERAR for $16.9 million.</p>
<p>Grupo Imsa, through its Imsa Acero subsidiary, bought the Comesi shares in January for $12.4 million.</p>
<p>"Given the excellent price obtained for the Comesi shares we believe that this decision is in the best interest of our shareholders," Eugeno Clariond Reyes, chief executive officer of Imsa, said in a company statement.</p>
<p>"The acquisition of Comesi was in line with our strategy to expand and take advantage of opportunities offered by Mercosur (the South American trade bloc). ...Grupo Imsa will increase its business activities in high value added steel and construction products in Mercosur," he said.</p>
<p>The statement mentioned Imsa's Stabilit business in Argentina as one area to increase its South American profile.</p>
<p>Grupo Imsa, based in the northern industrial city of Monterrey, has three main businesses: steel processing, automotive batteries, and construction. The company said it exported to more than 30 countries in 1996 with manufacturing and distribution operations in South America and the United States.</p>
