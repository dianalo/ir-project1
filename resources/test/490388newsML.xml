<p>PAXAR Corp chief executive officer, Arthur Hershaft said Monday the company's strong international business and a strong domestic retail environment will contribute to first quarter earnings per share in line with Wall Street estimates of $0.19 to $0.21 a share.  </p>
<p>The company earned $0.15 a share in the year ago first quarter, after an adjustment to reflect stock dividends.</p>
<p>"Our international business is much stronger than it was a year ago," Hershaft said. And the better retail environment in the United States will benefit earnings. Paxar is the world's largest manufacturer of apparel labels.</p>
<p>"In the end we're really driven by the retail environment," he said.</p>
<p>The company expects to report first quarter earnings April 23.</p>
