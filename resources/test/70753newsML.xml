<p>Sri Lankan troops killed or wounded more than 200 Tamil Tiger rebels in their first major push against the guerrillas in more than a month, the defence ministry said on Monday.</p>
<p>But military officials said the rebels put up stiff resistance against troops who on Sunday advanced on the rebels' northern Kilinochchi stronghold, backed by tanks, artillery and air support.</p>
<p>"Ground troops and terrorist transmissions indicated over 200 casualties among the terrorists," a defence ministry statement said.</p>
<p>A military spokesman was unable to say how many of the 200 from Sunday's action had been killed.</p>
<p>Military officials said at least 30 soldiers had been killed in fierce fighting around Kilinochchi by noon on Monday.</p>
<p>The defence ministry said one officer and 21 soldiers were killed and 58 wounded on Sunday alone.</p>
<p>"The army is spreading out from their last-held positions," a military official told Reuters. "We're meeting heavy resistance."</p>
<p>Defence analysts said they believed government troops tried to outflank Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebels who were well dug in at Kilinochchi, 285 km (180 miles) north of Colombo.</p>
<p>It was the first major push for more than a month by security forces who had consolidated at the road junction town of Paranthan, six km (four miles) north of Kilinochchi, a gateway to the rebels' jungle territory of the Wanni.</p>
<p>"Domination of areas well ahead of Paranthan defences by security forces started early Sunday," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Ground troops backed by armour, artillery and air support moved three km (two miles) ahead of Paranthan, he said.</p>
<p>Western aid officials said medical teams in the area had reported shelling and bombing near Kilinochchi but were unable to give details.</p>
<p>The LTTE rebels, fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in the Indian Ocean island's north and east, accused the troops of attacking civilians.</p>
<p>"The armed forces are directing their attack on civilian concentrations which are scattered around the intended path of the army's advance," it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Most of an estimated 150,000 people in Kilinochchi have evacuated the town since the military first launched its offensive in July but many live on the outskirts.</p>
<p>The Tigers set up base at Kilinochchi in April after the army captured the northern Jaffna peninsula, which the LTTE had ruled for almost a decade with their own administration, courts and police.</p>
<p>Jaffna is now separated from the government-held mainland by a big chunk of rebel territory that reaches from Kilinochchi to Vavuniya, 70 km (44 miles) south of the town.</p>
<p>The army has said it wants to reopen the main highway connecting Jaffna and Colombo, which passes through the Wanni, to reduce dependence on air and sea routes.</p>
<p>The military balance has remained largely unchanged since the LTTE overran the northeastern Mullaitivu camp in July, killing or capturing almost its entire garrison of 1,400 men.</p>
<p>It was the military's worst setback in the 13-year war in which the government says more than 50,000 people have died.</p>
