<p>Bunker fuel supplies from South Korea are expected to increase sharply in the fourth quarter of this year as its oil refineries complete expansion, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>The rise in production could force Korean refiners to cut prices as they compete for sales, they said.</p>
<p>South Korean bunker sales this year were estimated to rise to nine or 10 million tonnes, or about 58.5 to 65 million barrels, with particularly strong growth in the last quarter, traders said. In 1995, its supplies stood at eight milion tonnes.  </p>
<p>South Korea's overall production capacity will expand to 2.44 million barrels per day (bpd) this year from 1.82 million in 1995.</p>
<p>Bunker fuel supplies from Yukong Ltd have risen to 65,000 bpd recently from 50,000 bpd previously as its new 200,000 bpd crude distillation unit (CDU) started test-running for scheduled full production by the end of this month.</p>
<p>"With full operation, our bunker supplies could rise as high as 70,000 bpd," a Yukong trader in Seoul told Reuters.  </p>
<p>oil major Caltex Petroleum Corp, sees its sales rising to 40,000 bpd when its new 220,000 bpd CDU comes onstream in October-November. It sells an average of 30,000 bpd at present, a LG-Caltex trader said.</p>
<p>Bunker sales from Hyundai Oil Refinery Co, a unit of Hyundai Group  HYGR.CN, have more than tripled following its refining expansion to 310,000 bpd earlier this year from 110,000 bpd. It sold an average of 10,000 bpd previously.  </p>
<p>Supplies of South Korean bunker fuel 180-cst averaged $118.50 per tonne to date in September, undercutting the key Singapore price of $122 per tonne.</p>
