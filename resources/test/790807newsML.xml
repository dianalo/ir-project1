<p>NWE gasoline lost up to $8 a tonne on barges on Monday as losses seen late last week were extended. Drops in cargo levels were less severe at around $4-5.</p>
<p>Talk of an end of a squeeze and expectations of more material becoming available towards the end of this week has pulled the rug from under gasoline.</p>
<p>Traders said activity was slow on Monday morning with the market in a quiet mood after recent price buffetting. More business was anticipated once the U.S. kicks in.</p>
<p>Unleaded premium barges were pegged around $212 fob, but nothing was heard concluded.</p>
<p>August swaps were down at $206.50 from $210.50 with September dropping $3 to $190.50.</p>
