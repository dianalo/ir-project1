<p>The dollar fell against the German mark and the Japanese yen on Monday, weighed down by early weakness in U.S. stocks and uncertainty over the near-term direction of U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>Trading was thin amid Tokyo's Autumnal Equinox Day holiday and the Yom Kippur holiday in New York.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets on Tuesday amid market speculation that the central bank is poised to hike short-term interest rates by 0.25 percentage points to put the brakes on inflation.</p>
<p>Traders said it would take a 0.50 percentage point hike in the federal funds rate to move the dollar higher, while a decision to keep interest rates unchanged could push the U.S. unit lower.</p>
<p>"I don't think a 25 basis point hike is tremendously supportive for the dollar in the sense that it's pretty much expected," said Bill Marr, foreign exchange manager at Credit Commerciale de France.</p>
<p>In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.5125 marks and 109.89 yen, down from 1.5160 and 109.96 late Friday.</p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, the German mark came under selling pressure after European Union finance ministers, meeting in Dublin, Ireland, over the weekend, agreed on three key areas for bringing European and Montary Union (EMU) closer to fruition.</p>
<p>The ministers agreed to a stability pact to ensure fiscal discipline once EMU begins, a new exchange rate mechanism linking the single European currency to those not participating, and to greater legal certainty for banks in the run-up to monetary union in 1999.</p>
<p>The meeting bolstered optimism that EMU would be launched on time, sending the mark to a 3-1/2 month low against the French franc and a two-month low against the Italian lira.</p>
<p>The mark, seen as a safe-haven currency in times of uncertainty over EMU, had risen against its European counterparts last week.</p>
<p>The dollar initially rose against the mark in early New York trading amid worries over Russian President Boris Yeltsin's health after one of his doctors said the president's heart operation may be delayed.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who has a history of heart problems, is scheduled to undergo heart surgery at the end of this month.</p>
<p>Political uncertainty in Russia hurts the mark because of Germany's close economic ties with Russia.</p>
<p>The dollar later fell, led by declines in U.S. stock prices amid nervousness over interest rates ahead of Tuesday's meeting of Fed policymakers.</p>
<p>Spooked by the spectre of higher interest rates, the Dow Jones industrial average briefly fell more than 50 points in morning trade, giving currency traders an excuse to pare back dollar positions, traders said.</p>
<p>U.S. stocks recovered by the close to end up 6.28 points at 5,894.74 but the dollar failed to follow suit.</p>
<p>Last week, a Reuter report that eight out of 12 district banks in the Federal Reserve System had requested an increase in the discount rate heightened expectations that the central bank might decide to raise short-term interest rates.</p>
<p>In other trading, the British pound rose to $1.5562 from $1.5557 late Friday. The dollar slipped to 1.2362 Swiss francs from 1.2390 and to Canadian $1.3663 from C$1.3670.</p>
