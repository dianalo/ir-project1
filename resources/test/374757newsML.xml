<p>Figure skaters Kyoko Ina and Jason Dungjen stood in first place in the pairs at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships after the short programme on Wednesday.</p>
<p>World bronze medalists and defending national champions Jenni Meno and Todd Sand were in second. Shelby Lyons and Brian Wells stand in third.</p>
<p>The first sign of trouble in Meno and Sand's lyrical programme to Chopin's Fantasie Impromptu occurred when Sand had trouble placing Meno back on the ice after a lift. Then the pair made a major mistake and the audience learned why one of the required moves is called the death spiral.</p>
<p>Sand never got a strong grip with the toe pick of his skate to begin the death spiral and so was unable to support Meno. She ended the programme prone on the ice. This mistake required the judges to take an automatic deduction.</p>
<p>"I can't remember missing this in four years," Sand said. "We did something you shouldn't do at this level -- take something for granted."</p>
<p>It was the first mistake in what had been a promising and consistent season. In December, they won the NHK Trophy in Japan and, just weeks after Meno broke her wrist, finished in second at the Trophy Lalique in France last November.</p>
<p>Ina and Dungjen, however, were not taking first place for granted.</p>
<p>"We were in this position after the short last year," Ina said. "The final standings always come down to the long programme." The long programme will take place Friday.</p>
<p>In the second stage of the dance competition, the original dance, Elizabeth Punsalan and Jered Swallow continued to gain the judges' favour, again winning nine first-place ordinals and two perfect sixes for artistic merit.</p>
<p>This year's original dance was the tango and the only time Punsalan and Swallow stopped changing directions in their complicated choreography was to add a sensuous lunge or glide to the programme.</p>
<p>They remained atop the standings with Eve Chalom and Mathew Gates still in second and Kate Robinson and Peter Breen holding third.</p>
