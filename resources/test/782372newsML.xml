<p>Magelllan Health Services Inc said Wednesday that results for its fourth quarter of fiscal 1997 will be  reported without revenues from its CBHS operations, reflecting the sale of the company's hospsitals in the Crescent transaction.</p>
<p>This, said the company, wil adversely affect coming quarterly comparisons.</p>
<p>But the company also said that going forward it expects its franchise fee structure in other operations to take some of the seasonality and variability out of its quarterly earnings patterns.</p>
<p>The company reported a third quarter loss today of $26.7 million, or $0.93 per share, which included several non-recurring items.  On an adjusted basis, the company reported earnings of $11.9 million, or $0.40 per share.</p>
