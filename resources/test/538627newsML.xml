<p>Sabvest Ltd said on Friday it no longer had any interest in or obligations to either New Republic Bank Ltd (NRB) or Merchant Trade Finance Ltd (MTF) other than a residual collection of certain receivables from MTF.</p>
<p>The obligations resulted from the disposal by Sabvest's unit Merhold Investment Corporation Ltd of its interests in MTF to NRB in 1993 and its interests in NRB to Redbridge Assets Ltd in 1995.</p>
<p>Sabvest said the various rights and obligations which were concluded during the transactions had now expired.</p>
<p>The ending of these obligations will have no immediate effect on Sabvest's net asset value but will result in the elimination of its liabilities through its ownership of the Merhold Group.</p>
