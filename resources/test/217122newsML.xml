<p>Shares on the Lima stock exchange closed narrowly mixed in low volume Tuesday as some local investors bought shares they considered cheap, putting the brake on the recent series of falling prices, brokers said.</p>
<p>The market, however, was likley to return Wednesday to its downward trend because investors do not see the economy's growth rate improving until next year, they added.</p>
<p>Tuesday, the General Index fell 0.02 percent to 1,422.3 points, while the blue-chip Selective Index edged up 0.08 percent to 1,992.5 points, according to preliminary stock figures.  </p>
<p>"The exchange continues on its ugly path and investors have no other option than to play the market looking for very small profit margins to recover their losses," said Flavio Campos of local brokerage Finanzas y Valores.</p>
<p>The market has drifted down for weeks because the economy's slow growth has not encouraged investors to buy equities.</p>
<p>After several months of slow growth, the government estimates the economy will grow around 2.5 percent this year, down from 7.0 percent last year. The government predicts the economy will accelerate in the first quarter of next year.</p>
