<p>South Africa on Tuesday extended a ban on the carrying of dangerous weapons at public meetings to the entire country.</p>
<p>"We need to move away from the violence-ridden history of the past towards a more stable and law-governed society," the country's police minister, Sydney Mufamadi, said in a statement announcing the ban. </p>
<p>The order extends a previous ban, limited to volatile districts, to all corners of the republic.</p>
<p>Weapons, particularly traditional spears, machetes and axes but also hand-guns, have been commonly carried in protest marches in South Africa, and have often been used spontaneous clashes. </p>
<p>A weapons ban has been in place since March for Kwazulu- Natal, the Zulu heartland still marred by political violence between followers of the tribal Inkatha Freedom Party and President Nelson Mandela's African National Congress (ANC).</p>
<p>The government partially extended the ban in recent weeks to cover automatic weapons, hand-grenades and explosives after supporters of an anti-drugs Moslem group in Cape Town publicly executed a known gang leader and drug merchant.</p>
<p>Mufamadi said he hoped the ban would reduce the risk of serious violence at public events, and warned protesters the police would enforce the prohibition. Video film would be used to identify individual transgressors, he said.</p>
