<p>South African prosecutors on Wednesday refused bail to 24 Moslem militants arrested after an anti-drug rally turned violent and demonstraters attacked a police station where their supporters had been detained.</p>
<p>Western Cape Attorney General Frank Khan said he had instructed his staff to oppose bail for the members of the People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (Pagad), a predominantly Moslem movement.</p>
<p>Some 100 supporters gathered outside the Bellville magistrates' court on Wednesday, where police wearing bullet-proof vests had thrown up a cordon and blocked the suburb's main street.</p>
<p>"Their case will be postponed to Friday and all the accused will remain in custody," he told Reuters, adding they would submit further information to him before the next hearing.</p>
<p>A senior prosecutor said Pagad leaders Aslam Toefy and Abdul-Salaam Ebrahim were ordered to surrender to police by Thursday afternoon or face arrest for their role in arranging Monday's anti-drugs protest.</p>
<p>Monday's clashes began when about 200 Pagad supporters refused to disperse after an unauthorised demonstration outside Cape Town's international airport.</p>
<p>Thirteen people were arrested at the airport and several others were injured by stones, rubber bullets and police dogs.</p>
<p>Five policemen were seriously wounded later on Monday when Pagad supporters, many of them masked with Palestinian-style scarves, attacked the suburban Bellville police station where the suspects were held.</p>
<p>Khan said he met Pagad lawyers on Wednesday but was not convinced to support bail for the 24 people facing charges ranging from attempted murder to joining an illegal gathering.</p>
<p>Police on Tuesday suspended talks with Pagad, saying the movement had become "just another gang."</p>
<p>"Pagad is now firmly a part of the crime problem and not the solution in the Western Cape," said acting national police commissioner Zolisa Lavisa.</p>
<p>Pagad sprang to prominence in August when supporters publicly shot and burned to death a known drug baron in Cape Town.</p>
<p>The organisation calls for tougher police action against gangsters and drug lords and rejects any legal action against its own members until the gang problem is resolved.</p>
