<p>England lock Nigel Redman has been called from a tour in Argentina to join the British Lions squad in South Africa to replace Doddie Weir.</p>
<p>Weir damaged knee ligaments in Wednesday's 64-14 win over Mpumalanga province and will return home on Saturday by when the Lions hope to have the Bath lock in their ranks.</p>
<p>"He is a front jumper, a good scrummager with lots of experience and the right kind of character we need out here," said Lions manager Fran Cotton on Thursday.</p>
<p>Redman is the second player to be called from Argentina following the Lions' earlier request for the release of flyhalf Mike Catt who joined the Lions on Wednesday.</p>
<p>England coach Jack Rowell was reported to be unwilling to release Catt but Cotton did not forsee a problem over Redman.</p>
<p>"It would be unprecedented if the request were to be turned down," said Cotton.</p>
<p>Weir was injured when he was kicked on the knee by Mpumalanga lock Marius Bosman.</p>
<p>Cotton said they expected the provincial side to discipline the player and a second lock, Elandre van der Bergh, who was seen stamping on the head of Rob Wainwright.</p>
<p>"We made it absolutely clear to the local union that we expect them to take the appropriate action. If that doesn't happen we will have to consider our position," added Cotton.</p>
<p>Cotton said Mpumalanga should take action within seven days.</p>
