<p>Gulf Arab states remain concerned about Iran's political and military policies and believe it was up to Tehran to prove it was sincere about improving relations, a Gulf official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) -- a six-nation political and military alliance -- on Wednesday welcomed Iranian attempts to mend fences and commended the non-Arab country's new outlook as expressed by Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati on a regional tour this month.</p>
<p>"Foreign Minister Velayati was actively trying to improve relations," said Abdullah al-Khulaifi, a GCC assistant secretary-general.</p>
<p>"But only time will tell how true his statements are," he told Reuters. "Hopefully from the Iranian side the words will match the actions. The ball is in their court."</p>
<p>The GCC had called on Iran to respect the internal affairs of each country in the alliance, which groups Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.</p>
<p>"We have worries about Iran's militarisation, its increasing military presence on the UAE islands. We are concerned about the UAE's rights," Khulaifi said.</p>
<p>Velayati toured the six oil-rich Gulf states this month and said the visits helped open a new chapter in relations. Days later, Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah met at an Islamic summit in Islamabad.</p>
<p>Gulf Arab states have accused Iran of interfering in their internal affairs -- a charge Iran denies -- and have voiced concern over its arms buildup. Iran says its arms programme is defensive.</p>
<p>A sore point in Iran's relations with its Arab neighbours is a long-standing territorial dispute between it and the UAE over three strategic Gulf islands.</p>
