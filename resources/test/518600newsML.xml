<p>Bundesbank president Hans Tietmeyer said on Thursday that there were no signs the Bonn government was resorting to creative accounting methods to reach entry goals for Europe's planned currency union.</p>
<p>At a news conference Tietmeyer said he had not seen signs of creative accounting being used in Bonn and added "I wish that were the case in all European Union nations."</p>
<p>Germany has in the past been a very vocal opponent of certain one-off measures that could help nations meet the strict budget target of three percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Both France and Italy have introduced certain measures to help trim their budget deficits.</p>
