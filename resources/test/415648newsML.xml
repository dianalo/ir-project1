<p>The Sultanate of Oman on Monday launched its first international bond issue, raising more money than was expected.</p>
<p>The $225 million five-year Eurobond will be priced to yield 73 basis points over U.S. Treasury notes.</p>
<p>The bond has been planned since last year, when it was expected to be for around $100 million. Omani officials have held investor presentations around the world and the final size reflected stronger demand.</p>
<p>The deal was underwritten by U.S. investment J.P. Morgan.</p>
<p>Oman has a BBB minus investment grade rating from Standard &amp; Poor's. Other countries from the region that have tapped the international bond markets include Lebanon, which last week was rated BB minus by S&amp;P and B1 by Moody's Investors Service.</p>
<p>Last September Oman raised $400 million in the international loan market. The seven-year transaction was increased from $300 million after being oversubscribed.</p>
