<p>Turkish Energy Minister Recai Kutan said on Tuesday that French companies had expressed interest in building a gas pipeline from Turkmenistan to Europe via Iran and Turkey.</p>
<p>"We will sign an agreement with Turkmenistan next week for the Turkmen gas to reach Europe through a pipeline," he told reporters.</p>
<p>"Turkmenistan has a potential to sell up to 30 billion cubic metres of gas annually and it plans to sell it to Europe through a pipeline," he said.</p>
<p>"There are many foreign firms interested in the deal, especially French firms," he said, but declined to name any company.</p>
<p>Kutan returned from an official trip to Turkmenistan last week after sealing a deal for Turkey to get an initial three billion cubic metres of gas a year from 1998. He said he would return to Asgabadat next week with President Suleyman Demirel to attend a regional meeting of Islamic countries.</p>
<p>He said Turkmen gas would reach Turkey through an existing pipeline from Turkmenistan to Iran's Tabriz and another pipeline to be built from Tabriz to Ankara.</p>
<p>The line to Europe will link Turkey to Bulgaria and Austria, according to the original proposal made several years ago.</p>
