<title>UK: Mortar found near British army base in Belfast.</title>

<p>Northern Irish police said on Thursday they had found a loaded mortar close to a British army base in north Belfast.</p>
<p>"We discovered a Mark 16 mortar following a security alert at Girdwood barracks," said a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</p>
<p>The spokesman would not say whether police believed the mortar had been left by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), but security experts said the M16 mortar was one of the nationalist guerrillas' favoured weapons.</p>
<p>The IRA abandoned a 17-month ceasefire in February and, although it has carried out a series of attacks on the British mainland, it has so far carried out only one bombing in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>But republican leaders warned this week that hopes of a new IRA ceasefire are almost non-existent after British Prime Minister John Major effectively ruled out any new concessions to the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein.</p>
<p>The province is now braced for new attacks by the IRA in its fight for a united Ireland and armed police are once more patrolling Belfast's streets.</p>
<p>The mortar, a powerful weapon which is fired horizontally, was placed behind a house near the army base.</p>
<p>It was found after police evacuated homes near the barracks following a telephoned bomb warning on Wednesday evening. Police said the warning was a hoax.</p>
<p>Police found three M16 mortars along with incendiary devices and bullets in a raid on a house in west Belfast last week.</p>
