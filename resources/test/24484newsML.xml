<p>Breeders who led a herd of cows on a marathon march to Paris won a pledge from President Jacques Chirac on Friday that he would help save their livelihoods jeopardised by the mad cow crisis.</p>
<p>While the 26 cows rested in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower after covering some 350 kms (220 miles) in three weeks, the head of state spent almost an hour and a half hearing the grievances of five breeders who praised his "farmers' language".</p>
<p>"The president told us that he wouldn't let us down but he had no magic wand," Pierre Grolleau, 53, told reporters.</p>
<p>"For the outcome, we'll see tomorrow. We're people who are not in a hurry," he added.</p>
<p>"We told him we were losing 3,000 francs ($600) per animal and he said he couldn't compensate for all the losses because of the Budget Ministry," said Nathalie Telemaque, 29, complaining of prices that slumped because of this year's disclosure that mad cow disease appeared to be a risk to human health.</p>
<p>Shortly after the meeting, national statistics institute INSEE said prices for beef cattle fell another 10.2 percent in July, and were down 19 percent compared to year-earlier levels.</p>
<p>Chirac, a conservative popular with farmers since he started out as an agriculture minister lobbying for them in Brussels, struck a charismatic note with the breeders.</p>
<p>"He talks like a farmer. We laughed a bit, we interrupted each other," Grolleau said.</p>
<p>But the protesters from the central town of Charroux won no specific commitments or a timetable for reforms. "He spoke of reducing overheads rather than grants. He said he would safeguard cattle-breeding on a family basis," Telemaque said.</p>
<p>Chirac also discussed creating a new logo to better identify the origin of meat imports following a show of force by thousands of farmers who blockaded roads across the country before dawn on Thursday to carry out spot checks on lorries.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Alain Juppe said later he had given Agriculture Minister Philippe Vasseur orders to be "especially pugnacious" in seeking greater European Union aid for farmers hit by the mad cow crisis.</p>
<p>The cows did not follow their masters into the Elysee courtyard. "It's pretty difficult to manage stock here, even though we do have stables," quipped one Elysee aide.</p>
<p>Wearing jeans and sweatshirts with rolled-up sleeves, the herders were also stripped of their staffs before entering Chirac's gilded offices.</p>
<p>Some 1,500 breeders from various regions demonstrated on the grassy Champs de Mars park near the Eiffel Tower, joining the small group of Charroux breeders.</p>
<p>On Thursday, about 15,000 farmers blockaded roads across France, checking trucks in a protest aimed at barring imports of beef from outside the EU because of low prices caused by the mad cow crisis.</p>
<p>Thursday's blockades were the first in a wave of social unrest expected to target the austerity-minded government in coming weeks.</p>
<p>European beef sales plunged after Britain announced the discovery of a likely link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, and its fatal human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).</p>
