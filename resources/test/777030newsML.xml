<p>Water levels dropped all along the swollen River Oder for the first time since it began to threaten areas of eastern Germany with flooding almost three weeks ago, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>Authorities cautioned some dikes could still burst under the strain of holding back the river on Germany's eastern border for such a long period but officials in some areas were already planning to remove sandbags protecting their towns.</p>
<p>Government ministers from Germany, Poland and the Czech Republic turned their attention to the clean-up operation in the aftermath of the floods and to developing an action programme to minimise future flood damage.</p>
<p>"Our help can't end as soon as the time of the acute danger is over," said German Environment Minister Angela Merkel during a tour of the area. "The people need help and support over weeks and months."</p>
<p>Merkel met her Polish counterpart Stanislaw Zelichowski und deputy Czech Environment Minister Vladislav Bizek in the border town of Frankfurt an der Oder. They agreed to work together and said experts would meet to discuss concrete plans next month.</p>
<p>The floods have claimed more than 100 lives in Poland and the Czech Republic. Germany has escaped the worst but damage to homes, businesses and farms has been extensive.</p>
<p>German officials said the area south of Frankfurt an der Oder had recorded the sharpest drop in water levels.</p>
<p>In Ratzdorf, where the Oder and Neisse rivers converge, water levels had fallen 17 centimetres (10 inches) in the past 24 hours, a spokeswoman for the local interior ministry said.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt an der Oder itself, officials said sandbags would be removed and transported further north to the Oderbruch basin, a low-lying area 17 km (11 miles) wide and 50 km (30 miles) long which was still considered vulnerable.</p>
<p>"We're not out of the woods yet," said Matthias Platzeck, environment minister in Brandenburg, the German state worst hit by the floods. "You can't give any guarantees after nearly three weeks of pressure on the dikes."</p>
<p>The interior ministry spokeswoman said the river had fallen by eight centimetres in Hohensaaten, on the northern edge of the Oderbruch. Experts estimate the river needs to fall some one and a half metres (five feet) before the dikes can be deemed safe.</p>
<p>Soldiers and volunteers worked feverishly over the weekend to bolster the dikes on the Oder and repair new fissures in the dike near the village of Hohenwutzen, the focus of rescue activities in the Oderbruch basin.</p>
<p>Helicopters flew tonnes of sand and gravel to three weak spots near Hohenwutzen, Reitwein and Zollbruecke.</p>
<p>The floods have dominated German news bulletins over the past few weeks and networks have also broadcast special programmes daily with the latest news from the region.</p>
<p>Members of the public donated more than four million marks ($2.1 million) via a special gala programme to raise funds for the relief effort on Sunday night. ($ = 1.863 German Marks)</p>
