<title>USA: No support to alter USDA crop loan rules - Sen Lugar.</title>
<headline>No support to alter USDA crop loan rules - Sen Lugar.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-01-22</dateline>

<p>There is no sentiment to alter the crop loan rules written into the "Freedom to Farm" law, Senate Agriculture Committee chairman Richard Lugar said Wednesday, throwing cold water on a Democratic proposal.</p>
<p>"I do not favor that course of action," Lugar, Indiana Republican, said when asked about the proposal to remove a cap on loan rates and to give USDA discretion to extend the life of the loans for five months.</p>
<p>Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman has expressed interest in longer loan repayments as a way to bolster farm income.</p>
<p>Lugar told reporters that his committee had voted last year to put the cap on loan rates and he believed a majority still supported that step.</p>
<p>"We don't have a date for a hearing" on the proposal, he said, and listed a half-dozen other items that would take precedence. "That will not come up soon."</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle was backer of the propsal to remove the cap on loan rates and to give USDA authority to extend the life of crop loans. The Daschle package also would allow USDA to offer crop revenue insurance nationwide for wheat, feed grains and soybeans.</p>
<p>Lugar and the Agriculture Committee's Democratic leader, Tom Harkin of Iowa, have been wary of crop revenue coverage plans. Both expressed concern USDA might expand the program without authority and without adequate care to prevent huge costs.</p>
<p>Crop revenue coverage was an issue, Lugar said, that committee leaders "want to discuss around this table with the secretary."</p>
