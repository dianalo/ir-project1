<p>China wants to convince foreign banks to play a bigger role in financing aimed at its less developed central and western regions, the Business Weekly said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The newspaper, published by the official China Daily, quoted an official of the People's Bank of China as saying that the central bank wants to persuade more foreign financial institutions to step up their activities in these regions to boost economic development.</p>
<p>It did not say whether the central bank was hoping foreign banks would set up branches in these areas or whether it merely sought to direct more credit there.</p>
<p>It also did not say whether any specific incentives would be given to foreign banks to lure them to these areas.</p>
<p>Development of China's coastal areas has far outpaced that of interior regions, and Beijing is trying to pursue more evenly balanced development.</p>
<p>It has tried to shift certain industries such as textiles to these regions and has permitted preferential treatment for investment in such areas as well as priority funding for enterprises in these areas.</p>
