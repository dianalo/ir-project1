<p>APT Satellite Holdings Ltd is expected to price its Hong Kong offering of 10.5 million shares in a range of HK$15.48 to HK$19.35 per share, market sources said after a listing presentation on Friday.</p>
<p>The preliminary listing prospectus of the satellite services provider stated that net tangible book value per share before the global offering was at HK$2.02 and the proforma net tangible book value per share afterwards was HK$5.62, sources said.</p>
<p>APT plans to seek a dual listing in Hong Kong and New York, expected later in December, although a schedule was not available, sources said.</p>

<p>Earlier in November, APT said proceeds of the offer of about US$250 million would be used to repay bank debts and for financing the construction and launch of future satellites.</p>
