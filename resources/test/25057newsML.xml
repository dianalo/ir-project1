<p>Air Jamaica, after beginning its freighter service just this year, has added a third weekly freighter from Miami International Airport to the island, a company executive said Thursday.</p>
<p>"We are the number one, preferred cargo carrier to Jamaica," Air Jamaica's Miami cargo manager Orville Hart told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>The third weekly Douglas DC-8 flight brings Air Jamaica's weekly lift from Miami to 750,000 pounds. The airline flies 42 passenger flights weekly from Miami, Hart said.</p>
<p>Southbound, Air Jamaica carries a variety of goods including tractor parts, computers, hatching eggs and in a reversal for Miami carriers, perishables. Jamaican production of fruits, vegetables and seafoods cannot keep up with the demand from the tourism industry, Hart said.</p>
<p>Air Jamaica carries a lot of so-called "807 garments" both ways, Hart said. These are garments cut in the United States, assembled elsewhere and returned to the U.S. for sale.</p>
<p>Air Jamaica ranked 28th in the amount of international cargo carried through Miami in 1995, handling 11,421 tons, according to statistics compiled by the Dade County Aviation Department. - -Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017</p>
