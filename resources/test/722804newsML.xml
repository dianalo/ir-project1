<p>India will propose a new law under which companies may have to provide health care insurance to their workers before their business projects are granted government approval, Health Minister Renuka Chowdhury said on Friday.</p>
<p>The minister had told a business seminar the day before: "The bad news is I am going to ask for a charter so that along with environmental clearance, you have to get health care clearance."</p>
<p>Asked on Friday whether that meant corporate health insurance would become mandatory, she told Reuters: "It is a proposal for thinly disguised health insurance, yes. Health insurance has to be much more broad-based and encompassing."</p>
<p>Chowdhury said details of the proposed law had yet to be finalised. "I still have to go over it with a fine-toothed comb with other ministries," she said.</p>
<p>Chowdhury said areas where dams were being built were usually marked by stagnant water pools that bred malaria-carrying mosquitoes, threatening the health of construction workers.</p>
<p>"If a man can afford to build a dam, he can afford to pay for his workers' health," Chowdhury said.</p>
<p>In nearly a dozen sectors, including chemicals, fertilisers and power, businesses must receive Environment Ministry approval before they can set up projects considered potentially hazardous.</p>
<p>Some large firms are required by law to buy health insurance for their employees but most businesses are not covered by this regulation. There are presently no requirements for prior approval linked to health care facilities or health insurance.</p>
<p>India began easing a government monopoly on the insurance sector this year by permitting state insurance companies to launch ventures with a few Indian firms.</p>
<p>"If a multinational company comes into India, he must not look at my labour just as cheap labour -- he must keep them in good health," Chowdhury told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The man who undertakes a contract must evaluate the working conditions and the workers' health conditions. If they suffer from diseases, the contractor must pay," she said.</p>
<p>In her speech on Thursday, the minister also urged business leaders to introduce family planning incentives for workers in India, the world's second most populous nation with more than 930 million people.</p>
<p>"Family planning must become a trade union wage negotiation component," she said.</p>
<p>Some 16 million people are born every year in India, which is forecast to overtake China as the world's most populous nation by 2050.</p>
<p>Officials consider family planning to be crucial in rural India, where birth control methods are not well known, or face resistance due to social traditions.</p>
<p>Many poor Indians consider it important to have many children because of high infant mortality rates, Chowdhury said.</p>
<p>"The men who come as your workers and contribute to economic growth are also the decision-makers at home. Wage payments can be given to the wife of your employee so that he doesn't go and drink it away and she can use it for nutritious food to bring down infant mortality," Chowdhury said.</p>
<p>"The corporate sector has to address itself to relocating to rural India," she said. "We have to address three problems in family planning -- affordability, accessibility and acceptability."</p>
<p>Officials and population experts say India's population explosion spells trouble for the environment and the economy.</p>
<p>Population experts said businesses would need to create about 14 million new jobs every year in the next century to absorb a rapidly increasing labour force.</p>
<p>"There will be an increasing shift towards automation and mechanisation as well, which will further shrink employment opportunities," said industrialist Bharat Ram, who heads the Family Planning Foundation of India.</p>
