<p>Papua New Guinea (PNG) gas flowing to Australia at the completion of a A$2 billion pipeline project, would be competitively priced but not 'given away', pipeline project manager, Chevron Corp said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We are trying to dispel any misconceptions of absolutely cheap gas that is being given away," Bob Marcellus, Chevron South Pacific's government affairs manager, told a gas industry conference in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Marcellus said Chevron was interested in seeing PNG gas going to value-added activities and activities that did something for PNG.  </p>
<p>"Cheap gas doesn't do that. Gas that is competitive may do that," he said.</p>
<p>The South Pacific Pipeline Co, as it has been named by Chevron, aims to deliver gas from the Kutubu gas field in the Southern Highlands of PNG to northern Queensland by 2001.</p>
<p>Apart from Chevron, the pipeline consortium also includes PNG's Orogen Minerals Ltd and Oil Search Ltd, The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Oil Co Ltd.  </p>
<p>Earlier this month Chevron and Australian aluminium group, Comalco Ltd said they would jointly study the potential of extending the pipeline to the Queensland town of Gladstone, one of Comalco preferred sites for an alumina refinery project.</p>
<p>Malaysia's Sarawak state is the other preferred site for the A$1 billion refinery, which Comalco has said may later be expanded into a A$3.5 billion project.</p>
<p>Chevron has estimated that an 18-inch diameter pipeline extension from the planned terminus Queensland town of Townsville would cost about A$395 million to build.  </p>
<p>Marcellus said a number of consortiums were tendering to build, operate and become part owners of the pipeline with the cut off date for bids being June 16.</p>
<p>Chevron hoped to have a front runner from the bids by the end of July and announce that a pipeline company had joined the consortium by October 1, he said.</p>
