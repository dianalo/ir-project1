<p>The Israeli shekel representative rate was fixed unchanged against the dollar and the basket of currencies on Thursday after the Bank of Israel intervened to support the basket, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The trend of conversions of foreign currency into shekels which started on Tuesday after the rate decision continued today," said Ilan Zadka at United Mizrahi Bank.</p>
<p>The Bank of Israel said on Monday it was holding its key lending rate for June at an annualised 13.9 percent, a level unchanged since the end of February.</p>
<p>"We saw also some converisons of foreign currency for end-of-the-month payments. The Bank of Israel had to intervene in the market to support the basket buying dollars on a relatively low scale of $30 million," Zadka said.</p>
<p>The central bank has been intervening regularly in the market to support the currency basket, which has stayed at the bottom end of its trading band for four months.</p>
<p>The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.3950 shekels, unchanged from Wednesday. The basket, composed of the dollar, mark, pound sterling, French franc and yen, was fixed at 3.6957, unchanged from Wednesday.</p>
<p>On the crosses, the shekel traded against the yen at 2.9198 shekels per 100 yen compared with 2.9279 on Wednesday, and against the mark at 1.9938 shekels compared with 1.9940 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the late afternoon, the dollar was trading at 3.3940 shekels.</p>
