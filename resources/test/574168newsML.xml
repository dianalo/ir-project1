<p>Mexico's Foreign Affairs Ministry said on Friday it had acted against cases of torture, rejecting reports that torturers were going unpunished in Mexico.</p>
<p>It said that cases of torture had been reduced in the last few years, and noted that 53 public servants had been punished for acts of torture, including 14 cases of homicide tied to torture.</p>
<p>Human rights groups have long complained of acts of torture in Mexico.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, in a private meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Mexican human rights groups told her of what they said was an "alarming" rise in cases of torture, arbitrary arrest and disappearances in Mexico in the past few years.</p>
<p>"We must say Mexico has advanced in its fight against torture, has corrected the errors of the past, and has corrected the road when it was evident that the strategies that were followed did not lead to our goals," the government said in a statement released late on Friday.</p>
<p>"The positive results have been evident: acts of torture have been reduced in the last few years...," the ministry said.</p>
