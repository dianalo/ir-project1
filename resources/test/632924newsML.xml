<p>Soccer stars Bruce Grobbelaar, John Fashanu and Hans Segers go on trial on Wednesday for the second time on charges of conspiring to fix English premier league matches in the most sensational British case of its kind for 30 years.</p>
<p>Their first trial, which lasted for eight weeks and was estimated to have cost one million pounds ($1.6 million), ended in anti-climax on March 4 when the jury failed to reach a verdict on any of the charges. Prosecutors decided two days later on a retrial.</p>
<p>Zimbabwean-born Grobbelaar -- who won six league titles with Liverpool -- fellow goalkeeper Segers and retired striker Fashanu, as well as Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim, all deny the charges.</p>
<p>The four will appear in the dock in the southern town of Winchester accused of conspiring together to give and accept gifts of money as inducements to influence the outcome of soccer matches improperly or as rewards for having done so.</p>
<p>If convicted, they could face sentences of up to seven years in jail and unlimited fines.</p>
<p>The four, as well as Fashanu's wife Melissa Kassa-Mapsi, were charged after an police investigation into alleged match-fixing and corruption.</p>
<p>The case, triggered by media allegations in November 1994 about the activities of an Asian betting syndicate in English soccer, generated worldwide interest. Charges against Kassa-Mapsi were later withdrawn.</p>
<p>Premier league games attract heavy betting in Britain and in Asia on both the result and the precise score.</p>
<p>The case is the first of its kind since three players from Sheffield Wednesday -- including two England internationals -- were imprisoned for four months in 1964 and banned from soccer for life from fixing a match on which they had laid bets.</p>
<p>Grobbelaar, 39, moved to Southampton from Liverpool and now plays for second division Plymouth. He is the most successful goalkeeper in English club football after winning a clutch of medals during his 13-year career with Liverpool.</p>
<p>Dutchman Segers, 35, played a few games last season for non-league Woking while Fashanu, 33, who made his name with Wimbledon, retired with a knee injury shortly after moving to Aston Villa in 1994.</p>
<p>Grobbelaar denies a charge of accepting 40,000 pounds from Fashanu to influence the result of a Newcastle United versus Liverpool game in November 1993, when Grobbelaar was playing for Liverpool. Newcastle won 3-0.</p>
<p>Television presenter and businessman Fashanu, who played twice for England, denies giving Grobbelaar the money as a reward for having improperly influenced or attempted to influence the outcome of the match.</p>
<p>He also denies giving Segers 19,000 pounds as a reward after Wimbledon's 3-0 defeat at Liverpool in October 1994. Segers denied accepting the money.</p>
<p>Grobbelaar denies a charge of accepting 2,000 pounds from his former business partner, Chris Vincent, in November 1994 for throwing an unspecified match. Grobbelaar was transferred to Southampton before the 1994/95 season. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds)</p>
