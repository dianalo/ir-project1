<p>Sen. Sam Nunn said on Sunday he would most likely go to the private sector and not to the U.S. State Department when he leaves the Senate at the end of the year.</p>
<p>"I think I'm heading to the private sector, and I'm looking forward to it," the Georgia Democrat said on NBC television's "Meet the Press."</p>
<p>Nunn, top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, had been tipped as a possible successor to Secretary of State Warren Christopher.</p>
<p>He said if the job was offered to him he would seriously consider it, but added: "I don't think I'm on anyone's short list."</p>
<p>Other names mentioned for the job include U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright, former Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, and former Sen. George Mitchell.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Mitchell would probably be confirmed by the Senate if he was nominated as secretary of state.</p>
<p>Asked on ABC Television's "This Week" whether he would vote to confirm Mitchell to that post, Lott replied: "I probably would. I think there are some legitimate questions that need to be asked about foreign policy and about his record on foreign policy, but he is very capable and I think he probably would be confirmed if chosen."</p>
