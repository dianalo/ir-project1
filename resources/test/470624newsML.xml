<p>The European Commission has decided to take the European Union's Council of Ministers to court because it refused to give the European Parliament a role in deciding on beef labelling, a spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The Commission discussed this last night and has decided to take the Council to the Court of Justice," spokesman Joao Vale de Almeida told a news conference.</p>
<p>The Commission will hold talks with the parliament to see whether joint action before the Luxembourg court would be appropriate, he added.</p>
<p>Last week the parliament said they were considering taking the council to court and were seeking an opinion from their legal affairs committee.</p>
<p>The dispute arises out of last week's unanimous decision by farm ministers to reject a revised Commission proposal on beef labelling and identification and registration of cattle under a procedure allowing the parliament full co-decision.</p>
<p>Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler put forward the new proposal under article 100a of the Treaty of Rome which requires the parliament to agree with the council.</p>
<p>But ministers rejected the move and adopted a proposal which was already before them under article 43 which requires only that the parliament should give an opinion.</p>
<p>The Commission had promised to give the EU's directly elected assembly a full role after the parliament issued a damning report on the way the Commission and the EU had handled the health scare caused by BSE (Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy).</p>
<p>Last week's decision by ministers provides for a mandatory sustem of labelling for all beef and beef products, including country of origin, as well as rules on identification and registration of all cattle.</p>
<p>Announcing the decision to refer the case to court, Almeida told the news conference: "The Commission decided to change the centre of gravity to give greater emphasis to consumer and public health."</p>
<p>He said that the decision was political but with "strong legal arguments". -- Brussels Newsroom 32 2 287 6800</p>
