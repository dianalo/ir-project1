<p>WCE canola futures closed higher on Japan pricing at the close and gains posted in CBOT soy complex futures, traders said.</p>
<p>"There was Japanese pricing at the close that rallied the May $1. We're up on Chicago. It was mainly local buying," a trader said.</p>
<p>May WCE futures crush profit margin rose to -15.75 Monday from -17.09 Monday. May-July spread at $3.20, July-Nov at $61. Volume was 3,120 lots with 75 hedges. Japan overnight bought 5,000-8,000 tonnes of cash canola, sources said.</p>
<p>May canola ended up $3.10 a tonne at $423.60 and July closed up $2.80 at $427.10. May flax fell $0.20 to $358 and November lost $0.30 to $323.80 with commercial legging Nov flax for Nov canola.</p>
<p>May western barley rose $1.40 to $142.10 with Saskatchewan Wheat Pool buying, traders said. July rose $1 to $140.50. Alberta Wheat Pool and UGG sold the May-July spread at $1.60, traders said, and AWP sold October up $0.40 to $140. Volume was 1,000 lots. Oats did not trade.</p>
<p>News earlier in the day that farmers had voted to retain the Canadian Wheat Board's monopoly on exports of malt and feed barley had little effect on futures, floor sources said.</p>
<p>May feed wheat rose $1.20 to $172 on commercials, Cargill bought May-July at $4.20. Volume was 1,350.</p>
<p>RBC-DS bought five May feed pea contracts up US$0.40 at US$214.60 from UGG, traders said.</p>
<p>(All values in Canadian dollars per tonne, except feed peas)</p>
