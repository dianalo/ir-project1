<p>Breaking with tradition, European farm ministers tied up their marathon price negotiations in Luxembourg in time for tea on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But true to form they slipped various sweeteners into the annual package and threw out unpopular plans for cuts in aid to grain farmers.</p>
<p>The talks are often seen as a process of ministers wearing down Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler, the guardian of the Common Agricultural Policy, and EU officials said that this time they had also tried to coax his support for leaving unchanged the area of uncultivated -- or "set-aside" -- cereals land.</p>
<p>Although the French farm ministry regarded the outcome as a "done deal", officials said Fischler had refused to have his arm twisted on set-aside and wanted to wait until he had a clearer idea of the harvest outlook before presenting a Commission proposal.</p>
<p>Under an exhausting ritual, the farm price deal is usually hammered out after at least one all-night session when ministers are too weary to continue haggling for tit-bits for their farmers.</p>
<p>But this year, Dutch Farm Minister Jozias Van Aartsen, whose country holds the EU Presidency until the end of June, insisted on a more disciplined approach to the three days of hard bargaining in Luxembourg, aimed at achieving a clearer and more coherent agreement.</p>
<p>"We wanted to work out a deal during civilised, daylight working hours," a Dutch spokesman said.</p>
<p>Some of the EU's older farm ministers, such as Italy's Michele Pinto and France's Louis Le Pensec, both turned 60, had let it be known they wanted a full night's sleep.</p>
<p>As a result, the meeting lasted an extra day but no-one seemed to mind and even Fischler, the EU's Austrian farm chief, was able to express satisfaction despite rejection of his cherished bid to cut aid to wealthy wheat farmers.</p>
<p>The general view was that this should be discussed as part of a review of farm policy to prepare for the EU's expansion eastwards early next century, and the for next round of world farm trade negotiations starting in 1999.</p>
<p>Fischler is expected to present proposals in the autumn for a major reform of the cereals and beef sectors to make them more competitive and to prevent huge surpluses building up again.</p>
<p>German farm minister Jochen Borchert argued that a cut now in cereals compensation payments, which were meant to be permanent, would undermine farmers' confidence and fuel their opposition to future reforms.</p>
<p>The payments were agreed in 1992 to compensate farmers for a 33 percent cut in support prices, part of sweeping reforms aimed at removing surpluses and cutting costs.</p>
<p>Market prices have been much higher than expected, but farmers have still been paid for losses they never suffered. Most of the money has gone to a minority of wealthy "grain barons" in eastern England and northern France and Germany.</p>
<p>Rejection of the cut in grain aid could make Fischler less willing to co-operate with the ministerial call for an unchanged five percent cereals set-aside rate in 1998, officials said.</p>
<p>Set-aside is a scheme to remove costly grain mountains, under which farmers must take a certain percentage of their land out of production to obtain EU subsidies.</p>
<p>"It's not stitched up yet," a Fischler aide said, stressing that set-aside was a market-management, not a political, instrument to keep demand and supply in balance.</p>
<p>While farmers wanted a decision as quickly as possible, the Commission needed accurate data, the aide added.</p>
<p>A senior Commission agriculture official noted that last year the official harvest estimate rose by 14 million tonnes between fixing the set-aside rate in July and the final out-turn.</p>
<p>Recent rains had improved EU crop prospects and if favourable weather persisted another huge harvest was in prospect.</p>
<p>"An increase in set-aside may be needed," said one official, conceding that any proposal could be overruled by farm ministers acting unanimously.</p>
