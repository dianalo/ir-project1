<p>Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) will give 17 life and non-life insurance companies licences to do business in each others' fields later on Tuesday, a ministry official said. He did not give further details.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, 11 Japanese non-life and six life insurance companies submitted applications to the ministry to start operating in each other's turf. They plan to start their new business in October, industry sources said.</p>
<p>An amendment to Japanese laws on the insurance market, which took effect in April, allows insurers to conduct both life and non-life insurance business through subsidiaries.  </p>
<p>Jiji news agency reported that the ministry would withhold issuing licences for the accident insurance business to the insurers' subsidiaries.</p>
<p>Vice Finance Minister Tadashi Ogawa said last week the ministry, if necessary, may put conditions on the entry of domestic insurance firms' units into the so-called third sector, which covers accidents and health care.</p>
<p>Washington and Tokyo have been at odds over the entry of Japanese insurers' subsidiaries into the third-sector niche market, accident insurance in particular. Foreign insurers have a strong market position in that sector.</p>
<p>Several rounds of talks have been held to resolve the situation, and new talks are due some time in September.</p>
