<p>Chinese zinc suppliers were delighted at the leap in London Metal Exchange (LME) zinc prices last week but were waiting for them to move even higher before jumping into the market, metal industry sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>No offers of Chinese zinc had been heard, zinc traders in Hong Kong said.</p>
<p>"In China, if the (international) price is about US$1,150 per tonne, a lot of producers will be interested to sell," a manager at a zinc factory in central China said by telephone.</p>
<p>Many suppliers were preparing to sell in the world market and some smelters were looking to increase production, he said.</p>
<p>Domestic zinc prices were at the equivalent of about $1,065 per tonne, metal sources said.</p>
<p>LME zinc roared to a 23-month high on Friday, with three-month zinc at $1,147 per tonne.</p>
<p>Chinese producers were planning physical contracts, according to the counter price, one source said.</p>
<p>"That means they are waiting to sell," the factory source said, noting that if the price filliped higher producers could also sell as a hedging tool.</p>
<p>He said producers would sell at higher prices, buy domestic zinc concentrate at a low price and then start to export and try to sign long-term physical contracts.</p>
<p>"We are mainly concentrating on the physical price. Because it's at a premium to the LME, you make more money. We are rushing to sign physical contracts," he said.</p>
<p>Part of Chinese zinc makers' eagerness to export stemmed from a weaker domestic market, with abundant supplies before the end of the Chinese Lunar New year in early February, industry sources said.</p>
<p>The second reason was China's recent reduction of zinc export taxes from five percent to zero, which made exports easier, he said.</p>
<p>China had issued fresh zinc export licences, metals traders in Hong Kong said, with one estimate heard at more than 100,000 tonnes for 1997.</p>
<p>But producers and traders were eager to use up licence quotas left over from 1996, which are due to expire in February, metals sources said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong-based traders said Chinese zinc had not been offered in the market,</p>
<p>"I haven't heard any zinc suppliers very active in the market," said one Hong Kong-based trader. Another noted that zinc prices had been firming and Chinese producers would wait.</p>
<p>If LME zinc prices went up, particularly to around the $1,150 per tonne level, Chinese exports could increase by between 40 and 60 percent from the roughly 200,000 tonnes exported in 1996, a senior industry source in China said.</p>
<p>Most of China's zinc exports would go to Japan until April under preferential import tax policies on base metals, some industry sources said.</p>
<p>Japan's General System of Preferences (GSP) scheme extends tariff exemptions to metal imports from developing countries submitted for customs clearance by the start of the fiscal year on April 1.</p>
