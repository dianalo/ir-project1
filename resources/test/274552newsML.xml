<p>London prostitutes, miffed at having their telephone calls cut off by British Telecommunications Plc, have complained to government trade regulators.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the call girls have asked the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for a ruling on BT's policy of barring calls to prostitutes who leave lurid advertisements in public telephone boxes. They say it represents a restrictive trade practice.</p>
<p>An OFT spokesman confirmed the complaint was being examined.</p>
<p>Nearly seven million of the card-sized adverts, which often feature bawdy drawings or photographs, are left in phone boxes in London's central borough of Westminster every year.</p>
<p>Since August BT has been sending workers to note down the numbers on the cards. Customers are asked to promise to stop advertising and, if they do not, incoming calls are blocked.</p>
<p>"The decision we have taken is in the interests of customers who use public telephone boxes, who keep telling us repeatedly and vociferously that they find this illicit advertising offensive," a BT spokesman said.</p>
<p>Prostitution is legal in Britain, although it is illegal to solicit or operate a brothel.</p>
