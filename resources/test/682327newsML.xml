<p>Yugoslavia hope to confirm their place as the number two side in world basketball by retaining their title in the European championships beginning this week.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia -- runners-up to the all-powerful U.S. side in the Atlanta Olympics -- start as favourites, although the tournament promises to be one of the most open in years.</p>
<p>All but two or three of the 16 sides competing are in with a chance of a medal, or one of the five places that give automatic qualification for the next world championships.</p>
<p>Despite some injury problems Yugoslavia, who took the trophy on their return to international competition two years ago, are still the team to beat.</p>
<p>Coach Zeljko Obradovic will particularly miss Vlade Divac and Zarko Paspalj.</p>
<p>However Obradovic, who will be on familiar territory after his time in Spain coaching Real Madrid, should have no problems in steering his side past Group C rivals Latvia, Italy and Poland.</p>
<p>Although host teams have done well in recent competitions, a home victory this year would be a real surprise.</p>
<p>Spain, who have never won the competition, will be hoping to avoid a repeat of their disastrous 1992 Olympic campaign, although Lolo Sanz's team have looked unconvincing in warm-up matches.</p>
<p>"We lost to home sides in Germany and Greece in the last two European competitions, so at least we can't do that again," joked Sanz.</p>
<p>Spain play in Group D alongside Croatia, Yugoslavia's most obvious rival for the gold.</p>
<p>Croatia took silver in Barcelona 92, but the success prompted a drain of star performers to the NBA.</p>
<p>With the American sides increasingly reluctant to release their players, the Croats will have to look for substitutes for U.S.-based stars Dino Radja, Toni Kukoc, Stojan Vrankovic and Zan Tabak.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, an ageing German side, surprise winners as hosts in 1993, and Ukraine are unlikely to put up much resistance to Croatia in the opening phase.</p>
<p>Group A promises to produce fireworks with the confrontation of two much-improved teams, Greece and Turkey, traditional rivals both on and off the court</p>
<p>Bosnia and perennial challengers Russia complete the group.</p>
<p>Group B, with Israel, Lithuania, Slovenia and France, is perhaps the most open of the four.</p>
<p>Lithuania, on paper the strongest of the four, have been weakened by the absence of two players who have proved vital in previous campaigns, Arvidas Sabonis and Saraunus Marciulionis.</p>
<p>The tournament begins with Tuesday's opening ceremony.</p>
<p>Competition proper starts on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Groups:</p>
<p>Group A: Greece, Bosnia-Herzogovina, Russia, Turkey</p>
<p>Group B: Lithuania, Slovenia, France, Israel</p>
<p>Group C: Yugoslavia, Latvia, Italy, Poland</p>
<p>Group C: Croatia, Ukraine, Spain, Germany.</p>
<p>Schedule:</p>
<p>24 June: opening ceremony</p>
<p>25 - 27 June: first phase</p>
<p>29 June - 1 July: second phase</p>
<p>4 July: quarter-finals</p>
<p>5 July: semifinals</p>
<p>6 July: final</p>
