<p>Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance Group on Tuesday confirmed the sale of its Guernsey subsidiary to the offshore arm of Assicurazioni Generali SpA.</p>
<p>The unit, Sun Alliance International Life Assurance Company Ltd, was sold for 15 million stg, plus and additional consideration of not more than one million stg to reflect the embedded value of new business written over a two-year period from January 1997.  </p>
<p>Royal &amp; Sun Alliance said it sold the business as it did want to have two international life companies with which it ended up following the merger between Royal Insurance and Sun Alliance a year ago.</p>
<p>The insurance group said it would concentrate future offshore life activities through its Isle of Man operation, called Royal Life Insurance Ltd.</p>
