<title>USA: CME live cattle close with pared losses.</title>
<headline>CME live cattle close with pared losses.</headline>

<p>CME live cattle futures slipped again late but finished with pared losses after recovering early on speculative short covering. Feeders finished mostly higher following weakness in corn futures, traders said.</p>
<p>The speculative shortcovering in December offset heavy carryover sell stops from Thursday's limit break. The current large discount of December appears to be sufficent to cover the anticipated break in cash prices going into the winter, traders said.</p>
<p>"The action today tells us a bottom is in for a minute," one trader said.</p>
<p>December held technical support above the 65.500 to 65.750 area which added to the early recovery and took that month up to a net gain before it slipped again in light dealings. Fund selling continued to weigh on the market and generally offset light commercial buying, they said.</p>
<p>October showed underlying support from expectations of continued strength in cash cattle, but eased on long liquidation ahead of first notice day on Monday. Although the discount of October to cash should result in a lack of certificates being posted, talk that packers are planning to cut back on the kill weighed on sentiment, they said.  </p>
<p>Stone Traders actively bought December early to offset the carryover sell stops. R.J. O'Brien bought late after selling early. Refco was on both sides with buying considered commercial and selling from aa fund, pit sources said.</p>
<p>In live cattle options, a large 66 December put/62/68 call strangle spread was cited. February volatility was steady to firm and December steady, pit sources added.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle futures generally showed suppot following the lower corn futures. However, local liquidation pressured October. November followed, especially with live cattle down, traders said.</p>
<p>Lind-Waldock and ING bought October early while Cargill Investor Services, ADM Investor Services and LIT division of First Options sold. Prudential sold August and Lind-Waldock spread long January feeders/short December live cattle, pit sources said.</p>
<p>The latest CME feeder cattle index was up $0.15 at $63.94 per cwt.</p>
<p>Live cattle closed 0.275 cent lower to unchnaged with October off 0.200 at 71.925 and December off most at 66.025 cents. Feeder cattle ended 0.200 lower to 0.300 higher with October off most at 63.400 cents.</p>
