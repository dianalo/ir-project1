<p>The world's largest economies can expect moderate, non-inflationary growth in 1997 despite a continued lack of consumer confidence and some fiscal tightening, said a report released on Thursday by the Conference Board of Canada.</p>
<p>The private research group said the G-7 nations would post collective growth of 2.3 percent in both 1996 and 1997, with inflation rising to 2.3 percent in 1997 from 2.0 percent this year. North America was expected to enjoy the most stable growth, expanding by 2.3 percent in 1996 and 2.4 percent in 1997, the board said.  </p>
<p>The board said Canada would benefit from the significant improvement in its current account. Steady improvement in the balance of trade was expected to lift Canada's current account surplus to more than C$10 billion by the fourth quarter of 1997, the board predicted. The trade sector was expected to play an important role in Canada's outlook, with exports rising 4.7 percent in 1996 and 5.6 percent in 1997, said Peter Hall, a senior research associate with the board.</p>
<p>Growth in the Asia Pacific region was expected to lead the way, but would slow to 3.4 percent in 1997 from 4.5 percent this year, the board said.</p>
<p>Western Europe would expand at a moderate 2.4 percent pace next year from an expected 1.5 percent growth this year, the board said.</p>
<p>"Most nations are counting on investment activity and trade performance to buoy near-term growth," Hall said.</p>
<p>But those optimistic growth projections could be hampered by sluggish consumer spending.</p>
<p>Hall said that U.S. consumers were debt-laden, while Western Europeans were worried about high unemployment and the Japanese were skittish about bad loans in the financial sector.</p>
