<p>UK shipping, transport and property group Jacobs Holdings Plc said on Monday it expects to sell two panamax vessels in order to re-invest in larger, more modern roll-on, roll-off tonnage.</p>
<p>Jacobs Holdings acquired the panamax bulk carriers as a result of its 33.7 million sterling acquisition of Ropner Plc last month. The offer went unconditional last Friday.</p>
<p>Jacobs Holdings finance director Stuart Bridges said: "We are looking to increase our shipowning activities in the ro-ro markets. The new vessels could be secondhand but we have also been looking at the newbuilding market."</p>
<p>Bridges said the Ropner vessels were being sold because they were ageing and did not fit into Jacobs' existing shipping portfolio. He added that Ropner had been looking to renew its fleet for some time.</p>
<p>He also said Jacobs might look to move into other shipping areas in the future but was currently concentrating on the ro-ro market where it is active but would like to add larger vessels than it now owns.</p>
<p>Bridges declined to comment on a report in Monday's Lloyd's List that the 1983-built Oakby, a 64,197dwt Ropner vessel, had been committed for sale to clients of Greek shipowning company Tsakos for $12.45 million.</p>
<p>Ropner's remaining vessel is the 65,163 dwt Deerpool built in 1982.</p>
<p>Jacobs Holdings on Monday reported increased pre-tax profits of 3 million sterling for 1996, up from 196,000 in 1995, on turnover which rose 81 percent to 41.7 million sterling.</p>
<p>It said in a statement: "Our strategy of developing three core businesses in property, shipping and transportation and exploiting the synergies that exist between these businesses, is working well. We continue to seek further strategic acquisition opportunities in these three business areas."</p>
<p>Jacobs Holdings added: "The first two months of 1997 have seen a good level of activity in our port and shipping operations and we look forward to further growth following the launch next month of the new Zeebrugge service."</p>
<p>From April, Jacobs' Dart Line subsidiary will operate two return sailings daily between Dartford in southeast England and Zeebrugge in Belgium.</p>
<p>In January 1997, Jacobs Holdings acquired Sally (Bahamas) Limited for a total consideration of $10 million.</p>
<p>The company owns 50 percent of Rosal SA,a joint-venture company with CNM Romline SA,and is the owner of two vessels "Euroroute" and "Eurolink"; both sister ships to the Dart 2 purchased in December.</p>
<p>One of the vessels is currently chartered  to Belfast Freight Ferries and the other is the one that will be employed on the Dartford-Zeebrugge route in April.</p>
