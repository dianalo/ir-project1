<p>CME lumber futures continued to slip on pressure from a weak cash market and fell their $10.00 limit by the close, traders said.</p>
<p>July closed limit down at $374.60 per tbf and September shed the same to $365.50. Other months finished $9.80 to $1.90 lower.</p>
<p>Commercial and local pressure pushed futures down, with some sell-stop orders adding to losses along the way. Cash lost its momentum from last week and actual sales are being reported about $10 under the most recent official price quote. Further losses are likely on increased mill offerings, traders said.</p>
<p>"It comes down to supply and demand, and I just think there is too much production and not enough demand," said Neil Schmaedick, Smith Barney forest products analyst.</p>
