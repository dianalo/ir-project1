<p>A majority of Slovaks would vote in favour of NATO membership in a national referendum, according to an opinion poll by the independent Focus research agency.</p>
<p>Asked during the first weekend of February how they would vote in a referendum on Slovakia's NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) membership, 65 percent of those who would have taken part were in favour and 35 percent against, according to the poll, made available to Reuters on Monday.</p>
<p>In a Focus poll last November, 41 percent of respondents supported NATO membership compared with 23 percent against.</p>
<p>Slovakia wants to be among the first post-communist countries invited to join NATO when the alliance nominates candidates for membership at its summit in July in Madrid.</p>
<p>But Western countries have expressed concern about Slovakia's economic and democratic credentials and do not expect it to be among the first east European nations to receive an invitation.</p>
<p>Last week the Slovak parliament approved a resolution calling for a referendum on NATO membership, the establishment of foreign military bases on Slovak territory, and the deployment of nuclear weapons on Slovak soil.</p>
<p>President Michal Kovac must set a date for the referendum within 30 days and it must be held within a further 90 days.</p>
