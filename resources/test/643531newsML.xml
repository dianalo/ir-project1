<p>Forces of Afghanistan's Taleban Islamic government repulsed a big opposition attack in the north on Friday, a Pakistan-based Afghan news service reported.</p>
<p>The Afghan Islamic Press (AIP) quoted Taleban sources as saying the attack on the border between Samangan and Baghlan provinces was made by forces commanded by ethnic Uzbek northern opposition leader General Abdul Malik.</p>
<p>The Taleban, which controls most of Banglan province and some of Samangan, killed 11 opposition soldiers and captured 55, while five of its own fighters were killed, it said.</p>
<p>In a related development, an Iranian deputy foreign minister, Alaeddin Boroujerdi, met Malik in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif on Friday, a day after meeting ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani in the opposition-held northeastern town of Faizabad, AIP said.</p>
<p>Iran's state-run Tehran radio said on Thursday that Boroujerdi discussed the Afghan situation with Rabbani, whom Tehran still recognises as the lawful Afghan head of state, whose forces were driven out of Kabul by the Taleban Islamic militia in September.</p>
<p>The radio did not say where the meeting took place, but AIP said it was held at Faizabad, capital of Badakhshan province that is controlled by forces loyal to Rabbani.</p>
<p>Boroujerdi had stopped off in Tajikistan "on his way to Afghanistan" and met the Tajik foreign minister, the radio said.</p>
<p>Iranian media have denied reports that Rabbani recently fled to Iran.</p>
<p>The Taleban has frequently accused Iran of supporting forces loyal to Rabbani. On Monday it ordered the Iranian embassy in Kabul closed for alleged involvement in espionage.</p>
<p>Iran's Foreign Ministry denied the charges and said the embassy had been kept open for humanitarian purposes. Iran has denied interfering in Afghanistan's internal affairs.</p>
<p>Tehran has refused to recognise the Taleban government and continues to recognise Rabbani, who fled to northern Afghanistan when Taleban forces captured the Afghan capital.</p>
<p>Shi'ite Moslem Iran has accused the Sunni Taleban of being dependent on foreign states and giving Islam a bad name by its harsh interpretation of Islamic Sharia law.</p>
