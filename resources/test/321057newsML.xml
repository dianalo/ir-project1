<p>Niger, its economic reform programme disrupted by elections and political rivalry, plans to privatise its state telecommunications company before the end of 1998.</p>
<p>Information Minister Inoussa Ousseini, speaking in a televised debate late on Monday, said the process under an International Monetary Fund and World Bank structural adjustment programme was "irreversible" and the deadline would be met.</p>
<p>He said the government also was considering introducing cellular telephones in the sprawling landlocked nation if this did not threaten jobs. He said said none of the 1,250 jobs in the state posts and telecommunications company OPT would be at risk.</p>
<p>Niger's government approved plans to liberalise the telecommunications sector in June 1996.</p>
