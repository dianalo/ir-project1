<p>A British government spokesman said on Friday he was not aware of any formal complaint by privatised utilities about a planned windfall tax on their profits.</p>
<p>British Telecommunications Plc chairman Sir Iain Vallance said on Thursday the company owed it to its shareholders to mount a legal challenge to any windfall tax, while British airport operator BAA Plc  BAA,L said it is taking legal advice, although it does not expect to be affected.</p>
<p>Minister without portfolio Peter Mandelson said on Thursday night that the government planned to go ahead with the tax, which was a key part of the party's election manifesto, and that lawyers had advised the scheme could not be legally challenged.</p>
<p>"I just hope that the companies who are involved will consider their social responsibility and will also consider secondly the mandate that the Labour government has received from the public to introduce this windfall tax," Mandelson said -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7768</p>
