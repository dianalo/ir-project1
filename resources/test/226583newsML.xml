<p>Hong Kong's Rugby Sevens organisers are looking for new sponsors after the British colony's return to Chinese rule in 1997.</p>
<p>Cathay Pacific Airways and Hongkong Bank, two of Hong Kong's most profitable companies, said on Friday they were pulling out of the event for the 1998 event -- the first under Chinese rule.</p>
<p>Organisers would the market the "China angle" in finding a new sponsor, a Hong Kong newspaper reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>Peter Duncan, chairman of the Hong Kong Rugby Football Union, was quoted in the South China Morning Post as saying it would target organisations looking to expand in China.</p>
<p>"In 1998, Hong Kong will be under Chinese rule and this will bring a whole new outlook as far as the Hong Kong Sevens is concerned," Duncan said.</p>
<p>The Post quoted a Cathay Pacific spokesman as saying overall marketing requirements had forced the airline to relinquish its commitments to the Sevens. It had been a sponsor since the inception of the Sevens in 1976.</p>
<p>HongkongBank became a sponsor in 1980.</p>
<p>More than 150 years of British colonial rule ends at midnight on June 30. China has pledged to keep way of life of the freewheeling city of just six million people unchanged for 50 years.</p>
