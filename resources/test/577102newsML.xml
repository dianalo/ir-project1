<p>CME hog futures were expected to open steady to 0.150 cent higher while calls ranged from 0.200 cent lower to 0.100 cent higher for pork belly futures, analysts said.</p>
<p>Steady to higher cash hog indications and an improved tone to cash pork products late last week were expected to encourage early buying interest in hog futures. Hog runs remain lighter than anticipated and the reduced slaughter is supporting the pork compelx, they said.</p>
<p>Some analysts also said there was increased speculation of stepped up pork exports.</p>
<p>Latest CME lean hog index was up $0.48 at $80.03 per cwt.  </p>
<p>Pork bellies were expected to show carryover weakness following an easier tone to cash product continued concern that increasing amounts of product were going into storage. Higher futures prices recently had attracted warehouse storing interests, they said.</p>
<p>But some analysts look for possible support following lack of deliveris and the light pace of hog slaughter. Year to date hog slaughter is running six percent lower and this will keep fresh supplies light and reduce the amount of product available to go into storage, they added.</p>
