<p>Investor sales of mainly banks on worries that their profits might fall if they cut interest rates in the near future drove the index down 2.38 percent by the lunch break on Tuesday, brokers said.</p>
<p>Their concerns came after three major banks made small 25 basis point cuts in their key lending rates from Tuesday on encouragement from the central bank, they added.</p>
<p>"Although the cut in rates by the major banks was small, it created negative sentiment especially for those holding banks as they believed bank earnings would drop," said a broker.</p>
<p>The composite SET index retreated 16.00 points to 656.48.  </p>
<p>Major banks that have cut their minimum lending rates by 25 basis points effective today, include Thai Farmers Bank Plc, Siam Commercial Bank Plc and Krung Thai Bank Plc.</p>
<p>A broker at Securities One said the selling this morning came ahead of first quarter earnings of listed firms in other sectors next month. Last week banks and finance companies announced their results which were poor, analysts said.</p>
<p>"Investors now expect that the first quarter earnings of many firms would be poorer than their expectations," said the broker.  </p>
<p>Most major sectors declined by the lunch break. The banking sector dropped most in terms of value, falling 2.16 percent, followed by the communication sector, which slipped 5.66 percent.</p>
<p>Bangkok Bank topped the active list, retreating five baht to 173. United Communication dropped 12 to 138 and Siam Cement lost eight to 648.</p>
