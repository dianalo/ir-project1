<p>The Hubble Space Telescope on Tuesday forecast Martian weather -- cold and cloudy, with a possible transition to blowing pink dust -- in preparation for the July 4 landing of the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft.</p>
<p>"If we had to make a forecast for Mars right now, we'd say it's going to be cold and it's going to be cloudy," Steve Lee, an astronomer who studies Mars, told a news conference at the headquarters of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.</p>
<p>Even on the warmest day on Mars, the temperature only occasionally climbs to 0 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 18 degrees Celsius) and can drop as much as 212 F (100 C) from day to night, NASA scientists said.</p>
<p>Hubble images made on March 30 show a very different view of the Red Planet from those taken in the 1970s by the Viking and Mariner 9 spacecraft, which showed a dusty, static orb with patchy clouds, the scientists said.</p>
<p>These new images show a planet subject to violent and sweeping climate change, with long periods of supercold weather under high icy clouds alternating with spates of smoglike blowing pink dust storms spawned when Mars comes closest to the sun in its elliptical orbit.</p>
<p>The images also show a seasonally waxing and waning ice cap around the planet's north pole, surrounded by dark sand dunes. Also visible are volcanoes, canyons and deserts.</p>
<p>Judging by Hubble images made on March 30, NASA scientists believe Pathfinder will land on the Red Planet during a period of transition between the cold, cloudy period and the dust storms.</p>
<p>Pathfinder, slowed in its descent by a cocoon of air bags, is expected to land with a bounce in an area known as Ares Valles on July 4.</p>
<p>Ares Valles is at the mouth of what remains of an ancient catastrophic outflow channel, said Matthew Golombek, chief project scientist for Pathfinder.</p>
<p>It is a place where vast amounts of water may have been forced through a narrow space in a very brief period of time, dragging along rocks and other debris.</p>
<p>"It would be as if all the water in the Great Lakes was forced into a narrow channel to the Gulf of Mexico in about a two-week period," Golombek said.</p>
<p>If all goes according to plan, after Pathfinder lands, out will roll Sojourner, a roving, rock-sniffing robot about the size of a child's tricycle.</p>
<p>With cameras fore and aft and a geological probe that can determine the composition of rocks and other materials in its path, Sojourner will beam back images and data to give Earthbound scientists the best idea yet of what Mars is like.</p>
<p>The week before the scheduled Mars landing, NASA expects to make three more Hubble images of the planet to get a more up-to-date vision of landing conditions.</p>
