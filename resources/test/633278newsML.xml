<p>South African chemicals and plastics firm AECI Ltd said on Tuesday it had deepened its presence in the African explosives market by taking an 80 percent stake in Zambian mining explosives concern Kafironda Ltd for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>"Through its majority shareholding in Kafironda Ltd...AECI Explosives Ltd is well positioned as an effective supplier to the Central African region," AECI said in a statement.</p>
<p>AECI Explosives unit ICI Explosives (Africa) Ltd has bought 34 percent, previously held by the Zambian government, in Kafironda as well other stakes held by Covilink Ltd and Cobar Ltd.</p>
<p>AECI Explosives said the remaining 20 percent of the government's Kafironda shares would be transferred to the Zambia Privatisation Trust Fund for flotation on the Lusaka Stock Exchange at a future date.</p>
<p>The group said its new subsidiary was reinvesting in modern emulsion explosives and initiating systems manufacturing technology to replace the outdated nitroglycerine plant it closed at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>AECI Ltd is half-owned by Anglo American Industrial Corp Ltd</p>
