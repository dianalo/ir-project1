<p>New World Power Corp said on Wednesday the company's common stock will be listed on the Nasdaq Small Cap Market via an exception from the minimum bid price, effective October 10, 1996.</p>
<p>While New World Power was notified of its failure to meet this requirement in August 1996, the company was granted a temporary exception.</p>
<p>New World said it set a five-for-one reverse stock split and is entering into a definitive joint venture agreement with Dominion Bridge Corp by October 31, 1996, to meet Nasdaq's listing conditions.</p>
<p>The company said it believes that it can meet these conditions, however, there are no assurances that it will do so.</p>
<p>If New World Power is delisted from the Nasdaq Small Cap market, shares  may continue to be traded on the OTC Bulletin Board.</p>
