<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard said on Monday compensation payments arising from the total extinguishment of native title over all pastoral leasehold land could leave taxpayers with an enormous bill.</p>
<p>"Extinguishment may look a simple, easy option, but it has a number of drawbacks (and) one of them is the potential cost of the compensation involved," Howard told reporters.</p>
<p>"I have no idea what it could run into, but if you extinguish all native title in one sweep over every pastoral leasehold in Australia, the potential of that is very high indeed."  </p>
<p>The constitution requires the federal government to pay fair compensation for any property it acquires -- for example, Aborigines' right to the land as granted under last year's High Court Wik decision.</p>
<p>But he said the compensation bill could also be large under his 10-point plan, which would confirm farmers' rights over properties leased from the government, while guaranteeing access for Aborigines for traditional purposes.</p>
<p>Asked how much compensation was likely to cost, Howard said: "I have no idea and this is one of the difficulties of this. It could be big, it could end up being small, I don't know."  </p>
<p>Earlier on Monday, Howard met with state and territory government leaders to discuss his 10-point plan.</p>
<p>He told reporters he would impose the compromise deal to end the national row over conflicting claims between Aborigines and farmers, despite opposition from both sides.</p>
<p>Miners and farmers have said uncertainty has crippled valuable primary industries since the High Court ruled in December that Aborigines had undefined rights to government land leased to farmers.</p>
