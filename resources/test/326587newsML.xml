<p>Thai mobile phone operator Total Access Communication Plc said on Wednesday that the company expected to post a 36 percent growth in 1996 net profit from the 1.9 billion baht recorded in 1995.  </p>
<p>"According to our unaudited figures, the profit in 1996 is expected to grow by 36 pct compared with 1.9 bln in 1995," the firm's senior vice-president, Premon Pinskul, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The profit growth is in line with our earlier projections," he added.</p>
<p>However, he said that the company's profit margins for 1997 would be smaller as new competitors entered the market.  </p>
<p>He said the company's financial results for 1996 had so far not been formally submitted to the Singapore stock exchange where the firm is listed.</p>
