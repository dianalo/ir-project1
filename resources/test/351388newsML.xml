<p>Gold producers can expect the price of gold to stay near $375 per ounce, Echo Bay Mines Chief Executive Officer Richard Kraus said.</p>
<p>"Gold mining companies must make investment decisions and make money with the price at $375," Kraus told the National Western Mining Conference here.</p>
<p>He said the gold deficit of between 20-30 million ounces a year is being made up by central bank selling, which he called "the defining issue that overhangs the gold market today."</p>
<p>Kraus told Reuters later he expects continued consolidation in the mining industry, but that current economics rather than the price of gold are responsible.</p>
<p>He said companies have to be bigger to compete on a global scale.</p>
<p>Kraus told the conference Echo Bay looks for properties with a long life than can produce gold at between $300-$325 an ounce.</p>
<p>Alliances are key, he said. "We believe strongly" in forging alliances and partnerships, he said, noting that small companies are good at finding gold.</p>
