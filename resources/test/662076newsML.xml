<p>Slavia Prague earned themselves a place in European soccer competition next season, beating second division Dukla Prague 1-0 with a sudden-death goal in extra-time on Sunday to win the Czech-Moravian Cup.</p>
<p>Karel Rada scored the 'golden' goal 10 minutes into extra-time to give Slavia their first-ever national cup and salvage some pride after losing the first division title to local rivals Sparta Prague last week.</p>
<p>Slavia used their trademark smothering defensive tactics to foil Dukla pressure in regulation time. Both teams tried to attack from the start of extra-time, looking for the goal which would decide the match.</p>
<p>"It was excellent football," Slavia coach Frantisek Cipro said. "We had a lot of luck. We can thank (goalkeeper Jan) Stejskal for it by keeping the opposition off the scoreboard."</p>
<p>Dukla, the former army team under communism, have fallen on hard times in recent years. But despite Sunday's defeat they can take solace from the season, having regained a first division place by winning the second division title last week.</p>
