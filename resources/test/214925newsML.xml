<p>IBCA, the European credit agency, said on Monday it had affirmed Repsol's AA minus long-term and A1 plus short-term senior unsecured debt ratings.</p>
<p>"The ratings reflect Repsol's market position and sound financial profile as the largest industrial company in Spain and the sixth largest European oil company," IBCA said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Repsol has over 50 percent market share in Spain as well as increasing international interests, IBCA said.</p>
<p>"The recent acquisition of Astra, the fifth largest petroleum company in Argentina, as well as the participation in a consortium which acquired a controlling interest in the largest refinery in Peru confirms the company's interest in Latin America," the agency said.</p>
<p>S&amp;P said 1996 results showed improvement in all divisions except for chemicals, which is on the decline after peaking in 1995. The state-owned Sociedad Estatal de Participaciones Industriales (SEPI) currently holds 10 percent of Repsol's share capital. Full privatisation is expected during the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>"Although gearing has increased to about 50 percent as a result of the company's recent acquisitions, Repsol remains profitable, has a sound balance sheet and strong cash flow," IBCA said. "The group continues to dominate the Spanish market and recent acquisitions should expand exploration and production, traditionally one of its weaker divisions, while substantially increasing reserve levels."</p>
