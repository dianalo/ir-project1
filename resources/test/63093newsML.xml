<p>The top United Nations official for human rights said on Tuesday he was negotiating with Colombia and Indonesia to open monitoring offices there.</p>
<p>Jose Ayala-Lasso, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, also said talks continued with the Russian Federation on setting up a U.N. human rights presence in the rebel region of Chechnya.</p>
<p>He told a news briefing that the 100-member U.N. human rights operation in Rwanda was funded for the next four months thanks to voluntary donations. He confirmed the number of monitors in Burundi is soon to be doubled to 10 through March.</p>
<p>The U.N. Commission on Human Rights, at its last annual session in April, urged Ayala-Lasso to set up offices in Colombia and Indonesia. They were among five states named by Amnesty International for urgent scrutiny by the 53-member body.</p>
<p>"I have been asked to keep up my negotiating process with Indonesia to have a presence there, a programme in Jakarta," he said. "We are still in conversation and contact on this matter with the Indonesian government."</p>
<p>The Commission issued a chairman's statement last April expressing "deep concern" over alleged violations in East Timor. It urged Ayala-Lasso to send an officer to Jakarta who would have "regular access to East Timor".</p>
<p>Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year later, although the United Nations still regards Portugal, East Timor's former colonial power, as the administering power.</p>
<p>"The negotiations with Colombia are almost successfully concluded," Ayala-Lasso said. "My office there will have teeth -- capacity of action in the field of protection."</p>
<p>Colombia and Ayala-Lasso are close to signing a memo of understanding to set up a six-member team, U.N. sources said.</p>
<p>"We are very close to being able to sign," said one U.N. source. "Colombia is more likely in six months than Indonesia."</p>
<p>Ayala-Lasso said that his U.N. Centre for Human Rights, criticised in an internal U.N. review in 1994 for duplication of effort and poor management, should be more efficient after a major restructuring takes effect at the end of the month.</p>
<p>"The U.N. programme of human rights receives 1.7 per cent of the total budget of the United Nations, so there are very little financial resources appropriated to my programme," he said.</p>
<p>"What I want through this (new) structure is to produce a better job without requesting more resources for the time being...I am convinced we are going to be able to work in a more efficient manner."</p>
<p>Ayala-Lasso, a former diplomat from Ecuador, was named the first U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights in 1994.</p>
<p>In line with U.N. budget cuts, the Geneva-based centre cut its staff to 147 from 163 this year. It also oversees 184 experts working in U.N. human rights operations in Rwanda, Burundi, Cambodia, Malawi and former Yugoslavia.</p>
