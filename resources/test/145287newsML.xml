<title>CAMBODIA: Cambodia vows to halt illegal logging.</title>

<p>Top Cambodian officials have vowed to stop illegal logging and address shortcomings in the government's often-criticised forestry policy.</p>
<p>Government spokesman Sok An told reporters on Thursday the government had drafted a statement on logging along the Thai-Cambodian border that provides for "no export of new logs."</p>
<p>A Council of Ministers spokesman said the statement would be released on Friday.</p>
<p>Sok An said that cabinet members had approved a forestry policy pushed by international donors and a draft forestry law submitted by the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
<p>The announcements came after mounting donor dismay over a perceived absence of government action on continued logging and a lack of transparency in accounting for timber revenues.</p>
<p>Most recently, the International Monetary Fund threatened to halt payment of $60 million in loans unless the government corrected its timber policies by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Turning up the pressure, a World Bank official arrived in Phnom Penh on Wednesday to discuss logging with the government.</p>
<p>"We share the concerns of the IMF," the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The protests of international aid agencies carry some weight in Cambodia, where about 40 percent of the national budget derives from foreign aid.</p>
<p>The IMF, which provided a three-year, $120-million loan package to Cambodia in 1994, had suspended instalment payments to Cambodia in May, citing dissatisfaction with government accounting practices in the logging area.</p>
<p>The Cambodia Daily reported this week that IMF Central Asia Director Hubert Neis delivered a sharply worded ultimatum to the government over logging on October 4, raising similar concerns.</p>
<p>Neis told Cambodia to account for logging revenues by October 31 or lose its assistance package, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>Michael Kuhn, assistant director of the IMF Central Asian Department, is due to arrive in Cambodia on November 3 to discuss logging issues.</p>
