<p>Czech electrical utility Severomoravska Energetika a.s. (SME) on Thursday said it saw its net profit falling below 500 million crowns in 1997 from 540 million this year, the CTK news agency reported.</p>
<p>But CTK quoted SME's Economic Director Frantisek Korinek as saying the firm's board would still propose paying a 40 crown per share dividend on 1996 earnings, up from 30 crowns per share in 1996.</p>
<p>The firm's gross profit for the first nine months of this year dipped to 840 million crowns from 869 million in the same period of 1995.</p>
<p>Korinek said the drop in profit is being caused by stagnating prices of electricity for businesses coupled with only small increases in prices for household prices which have failed to cover rising costs.</p>
<p>"With this situation we are not able to cover the increase of inflation on the input side," Korinek said.</p>
<p>He added that SME would invest about 1.4 billion crowns into modernisation next year, possibly financed by a bond issue.</p>
<p>He said the firm expects total 1997 revenues to remain even with this year at 14 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The state holds controlling stakes in all eight regional power utilities, but has said it would privatise some of its holdings.</p>
<p>Britain's Eastern Group -- owned by industrial conglomerate Hanson -- bought an 11 percent stake in the company for 1.5 billion crowns last month.</p>
