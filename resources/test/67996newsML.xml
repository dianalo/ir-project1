<p>Crime and the economy are likely to dominate the next session of South Africa's parliament which went into recess late on Thursday after approving tax holidays for new industries.</p>
<p>A law on tax holidays of up to six years for new industries is the first legislation arising out a macro-economic strategy released by Finance Minister Trevor Manuel in June.</p>
<p>The strategy calls for the abolition of remaining exchange controls, some privatisation of state assets, manufacturing incentives and a social pact on wage and price restraint to boost annual economic growth from under three percent now to six percent by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>Deputy Finance Minister Gill Marcus said economic policy reforms would steer "a very unequal society to sustainable, competitive industrialisation based on the development of human and technical resources in an equal society."</p>
<p>The recess began mid-way through the refinement of laws to help police and the courts crack down on organised crime that is undermining post-apartheid investment.</p>
<p>Measures likely to be adopted later this year include the state's right to seize proceeds of crime, easier extradition, streamlined court procedures and an obligation on banks and other institutions to report even a suspicion of crime.</p>
<p>"The country is experiencing the devastating tyranny of violent crime that is running rampant," said Constitutional Assembly (CA) chief executive Hassen Ebrahim.</p>
<p>"Armed villains appear to continue their trade in death and misery with such contempt that some citizens feel obliged to take the law into their own hands."</p>
<p>Ebrahim's CA must finalise the constitution that will cement South Africa's young democracy.</p>
<p>The draft adopted in May was returned by the Constitutional Court because it lacked protection for watchdog bodies, did not adequately define the shape of municipal government and unlawfully took powers away from provinces.</p>
<p>Both the ruling African National Congress and F. W. de Klerk's opposition National Party have promised not to reopen old debates when specialist committees start on Wednesday to revise the clauses rejected by the court.</p>
<p>But senior negotiators admit privately that if conservative Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Inkatha Freedom Party decides at a weekend congress to abandon its 18-month-old boycott of the CA, negotiators could face a long and difficult debate.</p>
<p>Inkatha quit the talks to protest the centralisation of authority in the hands of the national government, but some members say they must return and salvage what they can.</p>
