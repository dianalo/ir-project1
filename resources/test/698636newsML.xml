<title>RUSSIA: Workers block Trans-Siberian railway in Far East.</title>

<p>About 300 employees of Russia's Far East nuclear submarine servicing plant broke through police barriers and blocked the Trans-Siberian railway for about two hours on Tuesday demanding to be paid.</p>
<p>Police officials told Reuters rail traffic had been stopped during the blockade at Amursky Zaliv (Amur Bay) station, 35 km (20 miles) north of the port city of Vladivostok, base for Russia's Pacific Ocean Fleet.</p>
<p>Police in riot gear tried to prevent the workers of the Zvezda plant, who say they have not been paid for 10 months, from blocking the tracks.</p>
<p>Reuters Television showed protesters squeezing through police ranks but there were no large-scale clashes or reported injuries.</p>
<p>Protesters had said they were determined to stay on the tracks until they receive tens of billions of roubles (millions of dollars) in back wages.</p>
<p>But they cut the blockade short after President Boris Yeltsin's representative in the Far East region pledged to pay the debt, also telling the protesters their act would only harm the situation in the region.</p>
<p>Viktor Kondratov said if it had continued the blockade would have resulted in losses worth 140 billion roubles ($24.2 million) and prevented trains with coal for local electric power plants from delivering their much-needed cargo.</p>
<p>Kondratov said wage arrears to Zvezda employees amounted to 61 billion roubles, but protesters insist they are owed about 100 billion.</p>
<p>He also said he would urge the president and the government to send a special commission to the Far East to solve the problems of the military-industrial complex there.</p>
<p>The region has been badly hit by a severe energy crisis and a wave of strikes in all spheres over unpaid wages. ($1=5,779 roubles)</p>
