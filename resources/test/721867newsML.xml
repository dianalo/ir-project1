<p>Lagos motorists were again queueing for hours for petrol on Friday barely a week after oil-rich Nigeria resorted to imports to end a long fuel shortage, residents said.</p>
<p>They said petrol queues had been steadily building up since Thursday night when some pump stations in the city of six-million ran dry.</p>
<p>"People are not taking chances," said one taxi driver.</p>
<p>But the authorities immediately said there was sufficient fuel to last Lagos for some time and attributed the queues to panic buying.</p>
<p>"There is no cause for alarm," said a spokesman for the Pipelines and Products Marketing Company (PPMC), the arm of the state oil firm responsible for fuel supplies.</p>
<p>"There is enough stock to last many days apart from a new consignment of 60,000 tonnes which arrived yesterday but could not be discharged in Lagos because the Atlas Cove jetty is too small for the ship to berth here," the spokesman added.</p>
<p>He said the ship had been diverted to Bonny terminal in southeastern Nigeria and its contents would be sent to Lagos on coastal vessels that carry 10,000 tonnes at a time.</p>
<p>PPMC ordered 33 cargoes of petroleum products from Europe to be delivered between last month and September when Nigeria says it will try to repair its own four oil refineries.</p>
<p>Nigeria, Africa's leading crude oil producer, was in chaos when a sporadic fuel scarcity that has plagued the nation since January turned into a major crisis in June, crippling public transport and businesses nationwide.</p>
<p>Its four refineries have a combined capacity of 445,000 barrels of crude oil daily but produce only a fraction of that due to deteriorating facilities.</p>
