<p>Italian bond futures pushed higher to hold to firmer levels in late afternoon reversing earlier losses helped by U.S. Treasuries and the strengthening lira on the back of a firmer dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>Treasuries were helped by comments from the Philadelphia Fed economist Michael Treding saying he expected continued moderate growth in the U.S., while a larger than expected drop in the U.S. trade deficit in October also gave support to world bonds.</p>
<p>"The news was coming from abroad and we are just tracking T-bonds, while there is some understandable cautious ahead of the CPI figures tonight," said one trader on LIFFE.  </p>
<p>Dealers said that preliminary data from ten Italian cities on Thursday and Friday is likely to see Italian CPI inflation held at November's 2.6 percent rate in December, but some believe it may even dip to 2.5 percent.</p>
<p>CPI data from Venice, Trieste, Perugia and Palmero is due at around 1630 GMT today, and figures from six further Italian cities on are due on Friday at the same time.</p>
<p>"The first four cities all have relatively low weighings on the index, so a better indication for inflation will come on Friday when the larger cities such as Milan, Turin and Naples report," said the LIFFE trader.  </p>
<p>Treasury minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said earlier this week that he saw Italian inflation over the next few months levelling out at November's 2.6 percent level.</p>
<p>Most European bonds had started weaker on the back of lower overnight Treasuries, which were depressed by worries about a five-year T-note auction later today after a lacklustre 2-year note auction last night.</p>
<p>Dealers said that trading had been generally subdued with many investors winding down for the Christmas holiday or cautious ahead of the CPI numbers which might still prompt a cut in Italian interest rates.</p>
