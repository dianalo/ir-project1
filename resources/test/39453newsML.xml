<p>State-owned Tanzania Petroleum Development Corporation (TPDC) has denied reports in the local media of a large-scale oil find along the country's Indian Ocean coast.</p>
<p>In advertisements published in the local press on Sunday, the TPDC said earlier reports that a prospecting company, Dublin International Petroleum, had found reserves of five million barrels off the southern coast were false.</p>
<p>"We take this opportunity to categorically deny the reported discovery of petroleum in Tanzania. There has been no discovery of oil," it said.</p>
<p>The corporation said Dublin International Petroleum had acquired exploration leases for two locations off the Tanzanian coast. Initial seismic data had suggested "some possibility" of oil reserves, but drilling of test wells would not start until later this year.</p>
