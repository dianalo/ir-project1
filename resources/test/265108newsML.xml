<p>Pearson Plc could jettison its merchant banking interests and theme park businesses under new chief executive Marjorie Scardino but she is likely to take her time before deciding what to sell, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Scardino, who takes over as chief executive at the turn of the year, is on record as saying Pearson's profit performance is inadequate and she is expected to sharpen the focus of the diversified media and leisure company.</p>
<p>Analysts say the company's ties with the Lazard Investment banking houses could be severed and say its Tussauds Group exhibitions and theme park unit is another disposal candidate.  </p>
<p>An analyst at Kleinwort Benson Securities said that Pearson could raise some 600 million stg through the sale of its Lazard investments and its remaining four percent stake in satellite broadcaster BSkyB. He added that a further 400 million could be raised from the Tussauds businesses.</p>
<p>Pearson has a 50 percent stake in London merchant bank Lazard Brothers and nine percent holdings in Lazard Freres in Paris and New York.</p>
<p>The Tussauds portfolio includes London's famous Madame Tussaud's waxwork exhibition and theme parks such as Alton Towers in the UK and Port Aventura in Spain.  </p>
<p>The banking interests do not fit into Pearson's three core activities of Education, Information and Entertainment.</p>
<p>Analysts say that Pearson has yet to complete its 1990s journey from industrial conglomerate to focused media company and that the company's definition of its three core activities needs to be sharpened.</p>
<p>"A lot of Pearson's businesses are high quality entities. It doesn't really matter that much which ones they sell as long as they solve the problem of management resources and capital being too thinly spread," said one.</p>
<p>But immediate fireworks are not expected from Scardino.  </p>
<p>"I think that Marjorie Scardino is going to take her time and have a good look at the business. I don't expect major changes in the first few weeks," said Rebecca Winnington-Ingram of Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>Scardino, who takes over following the retirement of Frank Barlow, is moving across from The Economist, 50 percent owned by Pearson. But she emphatically rejects the tag of Pearson insider and says that she will make radical change if necessary.</p>
<p>Some insight into what she regards as key business is provided by recent international Pearson acquisitions in consumer book publishing and the business press.  </p>
<p>Pearson, owner of Penguin Books, said last month that it was paying $336 million for U.S. publisher Putnam Berkley, a move it said would create a publishing powerhouse. Putnam Berkley has a strong stable of contemporary authors and is seen as a good addition to Pearson's powerful back catalogue.</p>
<p>A week ago the company paid 11.5 million stg to buy a 50 percent stake in South African titles Business Day and Financial Mail. Pearson's exisiting business titles include the influential Financial Times.</p>
<p>Pearson shares added 28p to 717 1/2p by 1215 GMT as the market welcomed a steady trading statement.  </p>
<p>Analysts said there was little new in the statement but that there was relief that the statement contained no nasty surprises.</p>
