<p>Yen-based Tokyo precious metal futures ended higher on Tuesday, with nearly all palladium futures surging by their 24 yen per gram daily limit.</p>
<p>Gold futures ranged from 11 yen to 17 yen per gram higher. Benchmark June was up 13 yen at 1,226 yen.</p>
<p>Benchmark June palladium rose by its daily limit of 24 yen to close at 612 yen.</p>
<p>"Despite Russia's resumption of platinum group metal (PGM) exports, lower TOCOM prices relative to spot prices forced investors to cover their shorts," one trader said.  </p>
<p>Traders said sentiment towards PGMs remained bullish, given a large overhang in TOCOM short positions held by private investors, especially in palladium futures.</p>
<p>Benchmark June platinum ended up 15 yen at 1,438 yen.</p>
<p>"PGM futures will not fall for a while due to strong palladium demand in the U.S. and lingering concern over Russian PGM supplies," one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders also said a fall in Japan's PGM imports for June released by the Finance Ministry on Tuesday, was due to the suspension in Russian exports.</p>
<p>Buying by private investors boosted gold futures.  </p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold was quoted at $327.60/328.00 per ounce at 0758 GMT, against $328.50/329.30 in New York on Monday.</p>
<p>Investors were tending to hold moderately bullish views on both TOCOM gold and bullion prices.</p>
<p>Private investors bought gold futures based on a perception that the dollar has more scope to rise against the yen, while trade houses bought spot gold in arbitrage dealings.</p>
<p>Benchmark June silver finished up 3.1 yen per 10 grams at 169.6 yen.</p>
