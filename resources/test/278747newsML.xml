<p>The Singapore economy is likely to grow by just five or six percent next year after an expansion of six to seven percent in 1996, the head of Singapore's third largest bank, United Overseas Bank Ltd (UOB), said on Friday.</p>
<p>"I think 1997 growth will certainly slow down to 5-6 percent," UOB chairman and chief executive officer Wee Cho Yaw told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>"This year, I think we will see 6-7 percent. Singapore's economy is reaching maturity," he said.</p>
<p>Wee said Malaysia's economy was likely to grow faster than Singapore's in the immediate future.  </p>
<p>Singapore's gross domestic product (GDP) grew by a healthy 10.4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 1996 but this slowed to just 3.2 percent in the third quarter due to a slump in its key electronics industry.</p>
<p>The government's most recent official forecast for GDP growth is "about six percent" in 1996 and 5-7 percent in 1997.</p>
