<p>The U.N. Security Council on Tuesday was expected to maintain crushing economic sanctions against Iraq as the United States prepared to move against President Saddam Hussein for attacking rebel Kurds.</p>
<p>The meeting, scheduled for the late afternoon, will be the regular 60-day review of Iraq's compliance with the Gulf War ceasefire terms. Lifting economic sanctions depends upon Iraq's compliance.</p>
<p>On Sunday Secretary-General Boutros-Boutros Ghali decided to delay implementation of Iraq's desperately needed limited oil sales deal to buy food and medicine because of the turbulence in the north and the danger to U.N. employees from the military action.</p>
<p>Tuesday's session, which usually is an open-and-shut, no-vote decision to keep the sanctions in place, may turn into a debate over Iraq's military action against the Kurds.</p>
<p>Baghdad's troops last week entered a Kurdish enclave on its territority in support of the forces from the Kurdistan Democratic Party against its rival faction, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, which is favoured by Iran.</p>
<p>Edward Gnehm, the deputy U.S. representative, spoke to all 15 Security Council members separately over the weekend and on Monday briefed Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, whose U.N. guards are stationed in the north.</p>
<p>But so far diplomats said there is no resolution on the agenda and the United States' best hope would be a mild statement from the council which has never officially approved allied exclusion zones in Iraq.</p>
<p>Both France and Russia have issued cautious statements compared to the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>The United States for several years has invoked U.N. Security Council Resolution 688, which in April 1991 condemned the Iraqi government's repression of minorities, as an underpinning for creating no-flight zones in the north and the southern parts of the country.</p>
<p>However, Resolution 688, while encouraging widespread relief aid to the Kurds after the Gulf War, did not specifically set up a safe haven off limits to Iraqi troops. It also deliberately excluded military force.</p>
<p>Warnings have been sent by the United States, Britain and France to Iraqi envoys at the United Nations but they were not a part of any U.N. procedings.</p>
<p>But at the same time, most council members turned a blind eye to exclusionary zones, with many states believing that allied protection was necessary to alleviate the humanitarian catastrophe in the north that followed the war.</p>
<p>The situation is complicated by the fact that Iran and Turkey recently have sent smaller numbers of troops into Kurdish areas of Iraq, but were not punished.</p>
<p>Tuesday's council session, which was scheduled weeks ago, is intended to review Iraq's compliance with the sanctions imposed shortly after Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in 1990.</p>
<p>The council also will hear a report from Rolf Ekeus, head of the U.N. Special Commission in charge of ridding Iraq of prohibited weapons of mass destruction, about his recent trip to Baghdad.</p>
<p>Separately an exemption has been made to the sanctions in the oil-for-food plan which Boutros-Ghali delayed until the situation clarified in the north. .</p>
<p>He said he was postponing the dispatch of monitors to Iraq necessary for supervising the deal. U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana Foa said the decision was made out of concern for the safety of U.N. staff and not to punish Iraq.</p>
<p>The oil-for-food deal allows Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of petroleum over six months to raise funds for humanitarian supplies. The agreement was signed on May 20 and was supposed to be implemented over the next two weeks.</p>
