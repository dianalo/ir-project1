<p>South Korean chipmakers said on Tuesday they planned to temporarily suspend production lines of 16-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips for five to eight days and allow workers to take holidays.  </p>
<p>The decision was partly in reaction to recent falls in international spot prices for the chips, spokesmen at the chipmakers said.</p>
<p>Samsung Electronics Co plans to halt production lines for a week from July 26, cutting output for the month by about a third, spokesman Raymond Park said. "We will suspend our 16-megabit DRAM lines for seven days and need another two to three days before returning to normal operations," he said.</p>
<p>LG Semicon Co plans to stop production lines for eight days and Hyundai Electronics Industries Co for five days, spokesmen for those two companies said.  </p>
<p>The international spot price for 16-megabit DRAM chips has fallen to below $7 per unit these days from this year's peak at over $10 in April, the spokesmen said.</p>
<p>They attributed the recent price drop to traditionally low demand during the summer.</p>
<p>They said South Korean chipmakers were not too worried about weak spot prices because their sales were mostly made in long-term contracts.</p>
<p>"Our long-term contract price is now stable at $8-$9 per unit, compared with this year's peak at around $10 in April," said LG Semicon spokesman Han Dong-mun.</p>
