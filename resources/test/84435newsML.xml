<p>CSCE world sugar futures settled sharply firmer and near the day's highs on trade and speculative buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>A dearth of selling interest contributed to firmer prices.</p>
<p>The most-active March contract closed up 0.22 at 10.89, having ranged from 10.94 to 10.72. Spot-October, which expires today, surged 0.43 on the day to close at 11.47. The back months finished unchanged to 0.16 firmer.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 28,606 lots.</p>
<p>Trade buying gave the market an initial boost and speculative interest emerged once open interest, released around midsession, was shown to have swelled by 12,832 lots to 87,950 lots, in the March contract.</p>
<p>"The jump in open interst shows the funds got short on the decline and now they're covering," said Judith Ganes, an analyst with Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Market sources said prices are likely to climb even further. "We had a good close and could get a bounce early (Tuesday) on fund short covering," a broker said.</p>
<p>Ganes noted that the March contract surpassed Friday's high of 10.88 and rose to a high of 11.94 today.  </p>
<p>Ann Prendergast, an analyst with Refco, said the recent commitment of traders report noted a trade position 23 percent longer than the ten-year average.</p>
<p>"That is a strongly bullish market influence," she said.</p>
