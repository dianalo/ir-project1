<p>Tom Stiansen won the men's slalom and Norway's third gold medal of the Alpine skiing world championships on Saturday while Alberto Tomba raced a storming second leg to join him on the podium.</p>
<p>"Me first and Alberto Tomba third --  I can't believe it," said Stiansen of his first career medal.</p>
<p>"No-one would have expected this, not even me."</p>
<p>France's Sebastien Amiez, the first-leg leader, was sandwiched between the two with the silver medal.</p>
<p>Stiansen, who had been third after the first leg, clocked a total time of one minute 51.70 seconds, just 0.05 seconds ahead of Amiez. Tomba was some way off in 1:52.14.</p>
<p>"Another bronze, just like 10 years ago," the Italian showman gasped. Tomba won his first ever medal -- a bronze in giant slalom -- at the 1987 Crans Montana world championships.</p>
<p>Austria's Thomas Sykora, poised in second place after the first leg, suffered a nightmare second run and finished in seventh place -- the position Tomba held after the first leg.</p>
<p>Tomba had been 1.50 seconds off the pace after the first leg and hurried back to his hotel, saying he did not feel well and was exhausted. Italian reporters said he was being attended by a team doctor and had a slight temperature.</p>
<p>He fell to the snow after he crossed the finish line and then struggled to his feet.</p>
