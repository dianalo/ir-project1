<p>Sherwood Group Inc said Thursday its Sherwood Securities Corp subsidiary had signed a $9.2 million settlement of litigation involving alleged share-price rigging.</p>
<p>Sherwood Securities signed the settlement with counsel for plaintiffs in a class action lawsuit, it said.</p>
<p>The suit named a number of Nasdaq market makers and alleged that firms had agreed to keep a large spread between prices at which they bought and sold Nasdaq stocks.</p>
<p>The suit is still pending versus over 30 other defendants in federal court in New York, the company said.</p>
<p>The $9.2 million settlement is subject to further verification and adjustment and was fully recognized in the company's fiscal third quarter results, it said.</p>
<p>Arthur Kontos, chief executive officer, said: "We believe our decision to settle this matter at this time is in the best interest of our company and its shareholders as it effectively minimizes the added time and expense that would be necessary to pursue the litigation."</p>
<p>Kontos said the company continued to deny the allegations.</p>
