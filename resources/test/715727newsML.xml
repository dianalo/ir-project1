<headline>IPE gas oil ends lower but key supports holding.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-09</dateline>

<p>IPE gas oil futures ended slightly weaker after Brent futures retraced afternoon short-covering lead gains, but traders said both markets were technically well supported and fundamentally underpinned.</p>
<p>They said talk that Iraq and the U.N. may resolve the oil for food aid plan and a bearish U.S. stocks report were countered by tighter European supplies of both crude and products and this combined with some stiff trendline resistance was putting a solid bottom in the market.</p>
<p>July gas oil last traded 25 cents down at $162.75 a tonne with July Brent off 23 cents at $18.15 a barrel.  </p>
<p>Both contracts were holding key support at $162.25 a tonne and $18.11 a barrel respectively.</p>
<p>Short-covering just before the NYMEX opening and following a report that European crude and products stocks had fallen in June pushed both markets sharply higher.</p>
<p>Brent cut through a wide band of resistance between $18.24 up to a brief break of $18.40 a barrel and gas oil bounced off resistance at $164 a tonne.</p>
<p>But sentiment turned weaker again and selling pressure pushed both markets back down to test what are proving to be strong support levels again.  </p>
