<p>The Central Asian state of Kyrgyzstan will open its first oil refinery this week, a plant capable of processing 500,000 tonnes of crude a year (10,000 barrels per day), the government said on Monday.</p>
<p>A government press office spokesman said the refinery, in Jalalabad, about 250 km (150 miles) south of the capital Bishkek, would be formally commissioned on October 5.</p>
<p>The facility was built with the help of Kyrgoil, a Calgary-based joint venture between the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan and Trans Hydrocarbon Ltd, which invested over $24 million in the project.</p>
<p>Kyrgyzstan currently imports all of its refined oil.</p>
<p>The new refinery, which will meet about one-quarter of annual domestic demand for refined oil products, will import 80 percent of its crude.</p>
<p>Bishkek said in August that it would buy about 300,000 tonnes of crude from Iran.</p>
<p>Half of the refinery's output will be heavy fuel oil (mazut), 12 percent will be gasoline and 38.5 percent will be diesel fuel. It also plans to produce jet fuel.</p>
<p>Kyrgoil signed a deal in December 1995 giving it exclusive rights to build and operate refineries in Kyrgyzstan as well as rework existing oil wells and drill new ones in the Fergana Basin in the southwestern part of the country.</p>
<p>It received a five-year tax and customs tariffs holiday.</p>
