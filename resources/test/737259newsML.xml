<p>Fashion designer Gianni Versace knew the alleged serial killer and gay prostitute suspected of his murder, according to Vanity Fair magazine.</p>
<p>A Vanity Fair profile of Andrew Cunanan, who police are hunting in connection with the killing of Versace and the murders of four other men, reported an exchange between the two men at the San Francisco Opera.</p>
<p>In a release from the magazine, a friend of Cunanan is quoted as saying Versace recognised Cunanan backstage.</p>
<p>"I remember you. Lago de Como, no?", the friend quoted Versace as saying to Cunanan.</p>
<p>The article said that "for Cunanan, who craved attention and for whom name-dropping was second nature, these were moments he lived for."</p>
<p>The profile by Maureen Orth will appear in Vanity Fair's September issue. The magazine released details after the slaying of Versace outside his Miami mansion on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Cunanan was already on the FBI's 10 most wanted list in connection with the killings of four other men, including his own homosexual lover, in a cross-country killing spree in April and May.</p>
<p>Police are now searching for him as the only suspect in the Versace murder. Law enforcement officials have said they have no knowledge of any relationship between Cunanan and Versace, who was openly gay.</p>
<p>The Vanity Fair release did not say when the exchange took place nor give more details on their relationship.</p>
<p>Orth described Cunanan, 27, as a chronic liar with a biting wit who aspired to reach the top either through wit or charm, but "who was at the end of his rope when he went on his alleged killing spree at the end of April."</p>
<p>He had had a number of wealthy patrons, including one who paid him $2,000 a month, gave him a car and took him to Broadway shows and on holiday in France.</p>
<p>He was an habitue of gay video bars in various cities and targeted the people he wanted to meet.</p>
<p>"He would investigate older wealthy gay men who didn't have families and he would place himself in those circles and that was his living," a friend told Vanity Fair.</p>
<p>The murders of three of his alleged victims -- one had his face smashed in with a hammer -- carried the signature of what police called a "pathological sadistic sexual offender."</p>
<p>Cunanan's father was a navy veteran, although he sometimes claimed he was an Israeli millionaire, and his mother lives on welfare in Illinois.</p>
<p>Friends of Cunanan in San Diego said he led a lavish, gregarious lifestyle in the city's gay community, despite not having a job. His mother has described him as "a high-priced prostitute."</p>
<p>Police also want Cunanan for the murder of his former lover, Minneapolis architect David Madson, 33, and another friend from San Diego, former Navy man Jeffrey Trail, 27.</p>
<p>Trail's body was found rolled up in a rug in Madson's apartment, apparently beaten to death with a hammer. Madson was found shot to death in the weeds of a lake in nearby Chisago County.</p>
<p>Cunanan is then believed to have travelled to Chicago where he may have encountered real estate mogul Lee Miglin, 72, by chance. Miglin's body was found in his garage, slashed to death and possibly run over by his own car.</p>
<p>The fourth victim, cemetery caretaker William Reese, 45, was discovered murdered on May 9 in Pennsville, N.J.</p>
<p>According to a profile the San Diego Union-Tribune ran in May, Cunanan graduated in 1987 from the exclusive Bishop's School, a private school in La Jolla, California.</p>
<p>In the yearbook he was named "Most Likely to be Remembered."</p>
