<p>Domingo Cavallo, the former Argentine Economy Minister campaigning against corruption, has urged President Carlos Menem to "admit he has been hoodwinked" about a huge smuggling syndicate in the Customs Service.</p>
<p>Cavallo, who was fired in July after guiding Argentina to economic stability and zero inflation, said charges of a $10 billion smuggling ring and the arrest of one of his trusted former aides was a smokescreen to protect real criminals.  </p>
<p>"I hope Menem has the courage to admit he has been hoodwinked," Cavallo told La Nacion newspaper in an interview published Friday. "He has the opportunity to throw out those who deceived him and start a real fight against corruption."</p>
<p>Since he was dismissed, Cavallo has been engaged in a fierce battle with ministers and judges whom he accuses of protecting corruption. He is a sworn enemy of Interior Minister Carlos Corach, Justice Minister Elias Jassan, Menem's Chief of Staff Alberto Kohan and of the judge who uncovered the alleged "parallel customs" ring, Guillermo Tiscornia.  </p>
<p>All have denied the charges and some are suing Cavallo for libel.</p>
<p>Cavallo was enraged at the jailing for 13 days of former customs service chief Gustavo Parino, freed this week. Cavallo said Parino was a "political prisoner" and the whole episode made him "ashamed" to have been in Menem's cabinet.</p>
<p>The customs scandal erupted last September, when Tiscornia made charges of a smuggling ring involving customs officials responsible for contraband of $10 billion over four years.  </p>
<p>But Cavallo said, "Tiscornia convinced Corach, Jassan and Kohan in a meeting that the leader of all this was Parino, and therefore at the end of the day Cavallo. They pulled the wool over the president's eyes. It was all a big bluff."</p>
<p>Tiscornia was on holiday and could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Calling it "the biggest public relations manipulation operation the government has mounted in seven years" in power, Cavallo said the real smuggling ring centered on Buenos Aires' Ezeiza airport was controlled by a secretive businessman with interests in the postal business -- a powerful figure Cavallo has been fighting since mid-1995.</p>
<p>The former minister, who wants to run for Congress in this year's mid-term elections, was asked if there was any chance of a truce in his war with Corach and other cabinet foes.</p>
<p>"No. Absolutely not. The only way is for their influence to finish. As long as that mafia keeps operating I will keep unmasking it, so they lose operative power," he replied.</p>
