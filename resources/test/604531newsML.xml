<p>Welsh number eight Scott Quinnell was drafted in as a replacement for the unwell Tim Rodber on Thursday ahead of the opening match of the British Lions tour this weekend.</p>
<p>Rodber, the England and Northampton number eight, went down with gastro-enteritis on Wednesday and has not recovered sufficiently to play in Saturday's game,</p>
<p>The 24-year-old Quinnell replaces Rodber in the side to face an Eastern Province invitation in Port Elizabeth on Saturday, with Irish lock Jeremy Davidson coming in for Quinnell on the bench.</p>
<p>"Both Tims (Rodber and Stimpson) went down with gastroenteritis within a few hours of each other yesterday and they were immediately isolated in the same room," said Lions team doctor James Robson.</p>
<p>"They have both since had high temperatures and infrequent diarrhoea and haven't recovered as quickly as I'd hoped. It would be foolish for Tim Rodber to play on Saturday."</p>
<p>Assistant Lions coach Jim Telfer said that, while Rodber's absence from the tour opener would disrupt the team's playing pattern a little, it was a bonus that Quinnell had been training with the squad.</p>
<p>"Obviously it's disappointing that Tim Rodber can't play but all 35 squad members are of Lions standard and they all have to be able to fill in for each other. It won't be too debilitating for us," Telfer said.</p>
<p>For Quinnell, the chance to don the Lions jersey for the first time means he will be following in the footsteps of his father Derek and his uncle Barry John - both Lions stars before him.</p>
<p>"It's superb. It's a great achievement for both my father and myself to play for the Lions but I've got to put it out of my mind now and just get on with the 1997 Lions tour.</p>
<p>"It's great to be part of the opening game but we'll all get the opportunity at some time on this tour. I feel for Tim (Rodber) while I'm lucky enough to be given the chance to play on Saturday."</p>
<p>Robson said the Lions squad had a few other minor injury worries, including centre Scott Gibbs (thigh strain) and wing John Bentley (bruised toe), but he was confident both backs would be able to play in Port Elizabeth.</p>
