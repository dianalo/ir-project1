<p>Nine months after Reebok International Inc's chief executive vowed to turn the company around in 24 months or quit, Reebok is back in the footwear race, executive vice president Robert Meers said.</p>
<p>"I don't think we'll ever call (Chief Executive Paul Fireman) on his promise," Meers, considered the number two at Reebok, told Reuters in an interview from his office in Stoughton, Mass.  </p>
<p>Wall Street, which has long shied away from Reebok after countless disappointments, has sensed a comeback and pushed Reebok's shares up sharply in recent weeks.</p>
<p>After a two-year slide in market share for U.S. athletic footwear from 21.6 percent in 1994 to 15.9 percent in 1996, according to the newsletter Sporting Goods Intelligence, Meers expects to see a turn for the better this year.</p>
<p>"I think we're poised for a very small uptick quarter on quarter in the U.S.," he said.  </p>
<p>"The growth of the international athletic market is quite healthy because the whole meshing of sports and fashion is at a fever pitch outside the United States," Meers said.</p>
<p>Since coming out of nowhere to catch rival Nike Inc in the late 1980s, Reebok has stumbled in recent years trying to expand its success with women's fitness shoes.</p>
<p>While Nike has nearly doubled in size from $3.4 billion in revenues in 1992 to about $6.5 billion in 1996, Reebok has risen from $3.1 billion to $3.5 billion.  And Fireman, also Reebok's primary shareholder, went from being considered a wonder to attracting his share of criticism.  </p>
<p>This week, one of the nation's largest public pension funds, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), vowed that to improve performance at Reebok and nine other companies it would use "aggressive means" such as voting against directors and filing shareholder proposals.</p>
<p>CalPERS said in a statement that "despite an upswing in the company's stock, management has operated with insufficient accountability and weakened Reebok's long-term prospects."  </p>
<p>Halfway through Reebok's 24-month comeback plan, Meers, who is in charge of rebuilding Reebok's tarnished brand name, believes all the pieces are falling into place for long-term success.</p>
<p>Just recently, Reebok shelved its failed five-year-old "Planet Reebok" and one-year old "This is My Planet" slogans and is now airing more low-key advertisements.</p>
<p>A collection of shoes based on Reebok's DMX Series 2000 "technology," a series of air chambers in the sole to provide cushioning and stability, will be launched in 1997.  </p>
<p>Reebok reported strong fourth quarter earnings on Jan. 30 and, more importantly, said U.S. footwear futures orders the first six months of 1997 were up six percent -- the first increase since the fourth quarter of 1994.</p>
<p>In a industry where image is almost everything, Meers said one critic told him Reebok was a "$3.5 billion vat of vanilla ice cream" with no attitude.  "The fact is, people didn't get the underlying message of 'This is My Planet,' irrespective of how brilliant it was," he said.  </p>
<p>Reebok spent $466 million on advertising and marketing last year, including endorsements by top athletes such as Desmond Howard of the Super Bowl XXXI-winning Green Bay Packers.  Meers said Reebok will spend about the same amount this year.</p>
<p>Also this week, Reebok won tax cuts from the town of Canton, Mass., to consolidate its headquarters there from nearby Stoughton, Mass.</p>
<p>But Meers wants to temper the growing optimism, reminding investors that the company still has another 12 months left in its comeback plan.</p>
<p>"I'm really trying to not get the financial community worked up over Reebok because we've got 12 more strong months of focused execution in front of us," he said. "The biggest mistake I could make right now would be to smell the roses in 1997."</p>
