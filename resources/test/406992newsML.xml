<p>South Africa's Harmony Gold Mining Co Ltd is expected to seal a deal with Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd (Freegold) on the sale of Freegold's Saaiplaas No.3 shaft, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Earlier Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd, controller of Freegold, said it would hold a news conference with the other two firms at 1400 GMT on Thursday.</p>
<p>An Anglo spokeswoman declined to say what would be announced at the conference, but analysts said they expected a statement on a Saaiplaas deal.</p>
<p>"It must be Saaiplaas. I am not saying it is for sure, but I can't see what else it could be," one analyst said.</p>
<p>On January 13 Freegold and Harmony said they were in talks about the possible sale of the Saaiplaas No. 3 shaft and Harmony management would conduct a due diligence study.</p>
<p>The companies said workers at No.3 shaft would be re-employed at Freegold's Saaiplaas No.5 shaft and elsewhere in the Freegold group if the sale went ahead.</p>
<p>Analysts said a sale would suit both sides as Anglo is seeking to distance itself from its more marginal shafts, while Harmony -- with lower costs due to a wage structure orientated towards production bonuses -- would still be able to exploit the shaft.</p>
