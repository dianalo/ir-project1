<p>U.S. spot resid fuel prices mostly were unchanged Thursday in thin trade, with grades in the Gulf, particularly high sulphurs, still better supported by recent heat in Florida and buying interest for Mexico.</p>
<p>"Florida has had some weather, but New York hasn't had much. I don't think resid (prices) needs to do much right here," said one cash trader.</p>
<p>But some expected sulphur spreads to narrow near-term, with recent high sulphur buying for Mexico supporting the heavier end of the complex, while cheap gas prices and fairly mild East Coast weather slowed low sulphur utility burns.</p>
<p>In New York Harbor, physical one percent slipped 20 cents to $16.60-85, pressured by mild weather in the region and attractive city gate gas prices.</p>
<p>NYH August one percent paper stumbled another 20 cents to the $16.25 area amid further weakness in crude. September paper slipped to $16 or lower, traders said.</p>
<p>New York high sulphurs again were unchanged, with 2.2 percent still quoted in the low-$15s.</p>
<p>NYH 0.3 percent high pour also was steady at $18.00-25.</p>
<p>At the U.S. Gulf, one percent held around the $16 level, while three percent remained in the low-$14s.</p>
<p>A Florida utility tender for 180,000 barrels of one percent for August 5 delivery reportedly was awarded at $17.10 (delivered) but the deal was not confirmed.</p>
<p>No NYH deals were reported.</p>
<p>New York city gate swing gas prices held steady again again Thursday in the high-$2.30s/mmBtu, or $15.00 a barrel equivalent. Gas at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point, was unchanged to a penny lower at $2.15/mmBtu, or $13.55 a barrel.</p>
