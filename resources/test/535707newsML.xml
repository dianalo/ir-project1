<p>The U.S. Senate prepared to vote on a treaty outlawing chemical weapons on Thursday amid rising optimism among supporters that it would get the two-thirds majority needed for approval.</p>
<p>An 11th-hour letter from President Bill Clinton to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, was expected to help win over wavering senators.</p>
<p>In it Clinton pledged to withdraw from the Chemical Weapons Convention if other countries used its provisions to proliferate poison gas technology and endanger U.S. security.</p>
<p>Lott, who could be the key to pulling some Republicans behind the treaty, planned to tip his hand on how he would vote later in the day. But in comments to reporters, he expressed sentiments far more conciliatory than his earlier opposition to the treaty.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle, one of Clinton's leading pro-treaty Senate allies, said: "I think we are closer today than we've ever been. I think we could win this."</p>
<p>Approval of the pact would be a major victory for Clinton, who has invested much political capital in a high-profile lobbying campaign. It included a White House ceremony on Wednesday at which his 1996 presidential election opponent, Bob Dole, endorsed the treaty, reversing earlier opposition.</p>
<p>All of the Senate's 45 Democrats were expected to vote for the treaty, so supporters needed 22 Republicans to provide the 67 required if all 100 senators vote.</p>
<p>Lott released the letter from Clinton giving new pledges shortly before the Senate went into a rare two-hour closed session to discuss intelligence issues related to the treaty. Senators declined to discuss the session as they emerged.</p>
<p>The letter was aimed at easing concerns over treaty provisions requiring parties to provide chemical weapons defences and calling for exchanges of peaceful chemicals and technology between nations. Lott had voiced fears these provisions could be used by some countries to spread poison gas technology to so-called rogue states.</p>
<p>Clinton set out three scenarios under which he, in consultation with Congress, would be prepared to withdraw from the treaty. They were:</p>
<p>-if the treaty provisions were used to justify providing chemical weapons defensive equipment to a party that would result in degrading U.S. chemical defences;</p>
<p>-if it was used to justify transfers that would end the ability of a group of nations known as the Australia Group to control chemical weapons proliferation;</p>
<p>-or if transfers were made under the pact that jeopardised U.S. security by promoting chemical weapons proliferation.</p>
<p>Before the final vote on assenting to U.S. ratification, the treaty first had to clear a series of hurdles -- votes on eliminating amendments to the ratification resolution that would in fact make it impossible for the United States to ratify the treaty before it goes into effect next Tuesday. More than 70 other countries have already ratified.</p>
<p>The "killer" amendments would make U.S. ratification conditional on ratification by Russia and other countries said to have chemical weapons programmes including Iraq and Libya.</p>
<p>They would also require striking out two treaty provisions addressed in Clinton's letter -- meaning the treaty would have to be renegotiated -- and set standards of verification against cheating that could not be met.</p>
<p>Another amendment, which was not regarded as a "killer," would ban inspections of U.S. chemical plants by inspectors from states said to back international terrorism.</p>
