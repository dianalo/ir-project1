<headline>Italian court slams raids against Di Pietro.</headline>

<p>An Italian court ruled on Friday that police raids earlier this month on the home and offices of former anti-graft investigator Antonio Di Pietro were unjustified and illegitimate.</p>
<p>The court, in the northern town of Brescia, ordered piles of documents seized in the raids to be returned to Di Pietro, whose graft investigations helped topple Italy's corrupt political old guard in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The raids were ordered a few weeks after Di Pietro resigned in November as public works minister following the opening by Brescia invetigators of a probe into alleged irregularities in his work as a magistrate.</p>
<p>In a 23-page ruling, the Brescia court of review said the orders to carry out the police raids, which Di Pietro had called "a joke and squalid vendetta", had been "without motivation and were therefore illegitimate.</p>
<p>The court also raised serious questions about the probe into Di Pietro, saying prosecutors' accusations against him presented "significant anomalies" and "constituted about the only source of proof" against the former magistrate.</p>
<p>"...The proof that is supposed to demonstrate the existence of (misbehaviour) as hypothesised by the investigating prosecutor does not exist," the ruling read.</p>
<p>Di Pietro's lawyer, Massimo Dinoia, praised the decision and said the court's next move should be to throw out the case.</p>
<p>"This is a first and partial pay-back for the damages suffered by Antonio Di Pietro after months of probes and suspicions," Dinoia told reporters.</p>
<p>"I now hope the Brescia public prosecutors' office will ask for the investigation to be shelved," he added.</p>
<p>Di Pietro, a people's hero in Italy for his work with Milan's elite anti-graft pool of magistrates, alleged earlier this month that his most famous target -- former prime minister Bettino Craxi -- was behind a campaign to ruin him.</p>
<p>Craxi lives in self-imposed exile in Tunisia and says he is too sick with diabetes to return to Italy, where he has several convictions for graft to face.</p>
