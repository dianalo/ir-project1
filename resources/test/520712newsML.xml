<p>CBOT rice futures ended a quiet session lower on Friday, pressured by commission house selling, traders said.</p>
<p>"It was really slow," a floor source said. "Early selling from Dean Witter and (LFG) kept a lid on it all day. We had some local short covering on the way down."</p>
<p>Fundamental traders noted rice was trading at historically high levels with little bullish input to support it. Last year at this time, the May contract peaked at $10.00 per cwt. May closed at $11.69 on Friday.</p>
<p>Rice ended 10 to four cents per bushel lower with May off seven at $11.69.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated by CBOT at 400 lots, compared with Thursday's actual volume of 797 lots.</p>
