<p>The outgoing and future Hong Kong governments have joined forces to fight a tide of mainland Chinese children sneaking into the territory, Hong Kong newspapers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The team, composed of top-level officials from outgoing Governor Chris Patten's administration and future leader Tung Chee-hwa's office, was headed by Chief Secretary Anson Chan, the newspapers said.</p>
<p>The taskforce, established at Tung's request, had already met once.</p>
<p>"We will look into the range of problems of the lawful and unlawful migration of mainland people," security secretary Peter Lai told the South China Morning Post.</p>
<p>"We will, of course, give top priority to the problem of migrant children -- it has become very serious," he said.</p>
<p>Fears of a sudden influx of Chinese children have escalated in recent months as their number has soared on rumours of an amnesty after Britain hands Hong Kong back to China on July 1 after more than 150 years of colonial rule.</p>
<p>Both China and Hong Kong have denied plans for any such amnesty.</p>
<p>Social workers estimate that 30,000 to 130,000 children living in China are eligible to be reunited with their families in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Most of them were fathered by Hong Kong men and born to mainland Chinese women. Both the mother and the children have to apply for residency rights to join their husbands in Hong Kong -- a process which can take years.</p>
<p>Hong Kong operates a quota system, allowing 150 mainland-born people, 66 of them children, into Hong Kong each day to join their families here.</p>
<p>Hundreds of Hong Kong parents pay human smugglers, known as snakeheads, to spirit their China-born children into the colony.</p>
<p>Under Hong Kong's post-colonial constitution, a Chinese child will have right of abode here after July 1 if, at the time, one of his parents is a permanent Hong Kong resident.</p>
