<p>Indian Global Depositary Receipts posted further gains on Friday, driven by a strong local market and tight supply, dealers said.</p>
<p>"India is firm but the market is illiquid. Prices can run up very easily," a trader said.</p>
<p>Traders expect a generally positive outlook ahead of the budget on February 28, with the local market seen rallying in speculative trade in coming weeks.</p>
<p>GDRs should make ground on the back of the local market, but some traders warn that current high premiums to local prices are due to ease.</p>
<p>Traders reported selling in East India and interest in SBI.</p>
<p>EIH was unchanged at $19.00/$20.00 and SBI added 96 cents to $20.50/$21.50.</p>
<p>But they said gains made by the end of the month were at risk if the budget contained few positive developments.</p>
<p>"The interesi in India is speculative with little FII demand. Some people are saying they don't see a good budget," a dearler said.</p>
<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange's (BSE) benchmark 30-share index rose 29.34 points, or 0.84 percent, to 3,521.99.</p>
<p>The Indian GDR index  JCEAI closed at 72.25, up 1.25 points or 1.77 percent with the premium over the local market at 19.01 percent from 17.99 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>Taiwanese GDRs fell back after a strong Thursday showing. Traders said the Taiwanese market had run out of steam after an eqight day rally.</p>
<p>But a recovery in chip prices boded well longer term for the key electronics sector.</p>
<p>The Taiwan GDR Index closed at 104.50, down 1.98 points or 1.86 percent, a premium of 3.85 percent against 5.20 percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Taiwan Weighted Index shed 36.77 points, or 0.49 percent, to 7,499.51.</p>
<p>The Capel Korea GDR Index ended at 67.07 points, up 0.16 points or 0.24 percent and the premium at 43.29 percent over the local market.</p>
