<p>Mexican benchmark interest rates could close 1997 at about 18 percent, the Mexican Institute of Financial Executives (IMEF) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We believe rates will continue to fall, maybe with some upticks following sharp drops, as we have seen over the past two weeks," said Oscar Vera, head of economic research at IMEF.</p>
<p>"Bellwether 28-Cetes rates may well end the year at levels of around 18 percent," he added.</p>
<p>Banco de Mexico assigned 28-day Cetes at 23.17 percent at its primary auction of government securities last week, up from a low for the year of 18.59 percent reached on February 25.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Vera noted 28-day Cetes rates were still considerably lower than at the close of last year.</p>
<p>The benchmark interest rate closed 1996 at 27.25 percent.</p>
<p>Vera said the fall in Cetes rates would depend on how quickly domestic inflation fell and whether U.S. base rates increased.</p>
<p>"If there is a hike in U.S. interest rates, it will be a small one; we are not expecting a large increase... maybe 25 basis points.  We are not talking about a scenario of drastic changes," he said.</p>
