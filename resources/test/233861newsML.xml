<p>The obscure and controversial currency board system of regulating a country's money has many people scratching their heads in perplexity and asking: "What is it?".</p>
<p>Yet this crude but effective method of creating stability in a currency is at the centre of the economic policy of the Baltic states of Lithuania and Estonia and is under debate in Bulgaria. Farflung places such as Argentina and Hong Kong also use one.</p>
<p>The basic tenet of the currency board is that the central bank guarantees to back its local currency in circulation with foreign exchange reserves at a given exchange rate, and the provisions are usually enshrined in law.</p>
<p>Fans of the system say it helps cut inflation and increases confidence in currencies, but critics say it creates an inflexible monetary policy that harms competitiveness.</p>
<p>"The currency board has been one of the lynchpins of Estonian and Lithuanian reforms," Basil Zavoico, International Monetary Fund (IMF) representative in Estonia, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Lithuania's litas currency is pegged at four to the dollar and in Estonia the kroon is fixed at eight to one German mark.</p>
<p>HOW IT WORKS</p>
<p>The currency board means the central bank cannot print money it cannot back with reserves and takes monetary policy right out of the hands of politicians.</p>
<p>The flip side is that the central bank becomes something of a pale shadow, stripped of all the usual powers to influence monetary policy such as foreign exchange market intervention and interest rate manipulation.</p>
<p>"The currency board imposes monetary discipline because by law it stops the central bank giving credits to the government," said Domenico Fanizza, Lithuania's IMF representative.</p>
<p>"The government cannot go into the basement and print money to fund its expenditures," he added.</p>
<p>Economists say the currency boards in Estonia and Lithuania have helped to stabilise the two small countries after the shock of quitting the centrally-run Soviet economy.</p>
<p>The annual inflation rate tumbled from almost 1,200 percent in Lithuania in 1992 to just over 22 percent in September this year, while Estonia's inflation fell from over 1,000 percent to under 20 percent in the same period.</p>
<p>CURRENCY BOARDS CONTROVERSIAL</p>
<p>But currency boards are controversial.</p>
<p>In Lithuania its introduction was resisted by the central bank, which believed it had been successful in stabilising the exchange rate after the litas was introduced.</p>
<p>It is still the target of attack and the right-wing Homeland Union party, which won recent elections, has vowed to scrap it and introduce a floating currency over the next 18 months.</p>
<p>The idea of a currency board has also caused upheaval in Bulgaria, where the lev has gone into freefall.</p>
<p>Debate has centred on what rate the lev will be pegged at and whether it will be against the dollar or the mark.</p>
<p>There are fears that if the rate is lower than the current low level then it will melt away what is left of peoples' savings and cause social unrest.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian central bank has proposed setting up a board of international experts who would evaluate alternatives to a currency board within the next two or three months and then decide whether it is the only solution.</p>
<p>The currency board is rarely questioned in Estonia, the northernmost Baltic state and the one considered to be the most advanced along the road of reform.</p>
<p>"There is a broad political consensus in Estonia that the currency board model has been successful and should remain in place," said IMF's Zavoico.</p>
<p>Another benefit supporters see from the currency board is that it tends to lead interest rates falling into line with those of the country the currency is pegged to.</p>
<p>"Estonian banks can borrow from German banks without worrying about currency risks and relend in the local market," Zavoico said.</p>
<p>He said Estonian interest rates had fallen from between 60 percent to 80 percent in 1992 to 12 percent to 15 percent today.</p>
<p>"It is easier for companies in Estonia to do business with their western counterparts when they know exactly what the exchange rate is. It is a source of stability," said one senior western economist.</p>
<p>But in Lithuania some politicians say the currency peg under the currency board system has led to an overvalued litas, strangling the country's export sector.</p>
<p>Zavoico argued this was not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>"Many of the industries in Lithuania were put there by central planners in Moscow and their locaation made no sense then or now," he said.</p>
<p>"They will be uncompetitive with or without a litas devaluation," he added. "Shedding uncompetetive industries is part of the transition process."</p>
