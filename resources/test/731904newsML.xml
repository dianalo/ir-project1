<title>RUSSIA: Russian shares losing ground on healthy volume.</title>

<p>Leading Russian shares dipped in the last hour of trading on Wednesday as volumes picked up for bellwether utility UES in what traders said was a bad sign for the market, still seen correcting from a recent rise.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System 22-share index had dropped 3.46 percent from the previous close at 1300 GMT to 453.46 on $49.92 million turnover and at 1343 GMT UES had eased to $0.4000, off a daily high near 41 cents and $0.4083 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"If you were a technician you would be worried by increasing volumes in a downward market," said one trader. "It is about a $30 million day in UES and the price has come down through a critical level."</p>
<p>"At this point it looks that all the sellers have not been shaken out," said ING Barings chief trader Peter Kizenko. "The market still has a few percentage points to come off before a period of stagnation for a couple of weeks."</p>
<p>Regional telecom Uralsvyazinform was one of the top losers, which one trader said was due to recent overvaluation, and fell to $0.047 from $0.050. Oil producer LUKoil prefs eased to $13.25 from $13.43 after the company announced a $125 million bond private placement.</p>
<p>Foreigners and Russians were seen both buying and selling in a market dominated by a dozen leading shares and a pattern of overnight ADR weakness in New York followed by some recovery in Moscow during the day was seen likely to continue.</p>
