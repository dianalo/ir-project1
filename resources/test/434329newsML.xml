<headline>K-III to offer non-core units for sale.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>K-III Communications Corp., a magazine publisher and mass media company, said Tuesday it would restructure, offering non-core units for sale and focusing on six high-growth businesses for the future.</p>
<p>Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William Reilly said the company would put up for sale Daily Racing Form and Pro-Football Weekly, Newbridge Book Clubs, New Woman Magazine and Krames Communications.</p>
<p>Those four businesses represent about 19 percent of 1996 revenues of $1.37 billion, he said.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the sales will be used to reduce debt and preferred stock. The company previously announced that it intends to sell Katherine Gibbs Schools.</p>
<p>Reilly said the company will focus on businesses in markets with projected growth of at least two times that of Gross Domestic Product.</p>
<p>The company will focus on its Workplace learning (Westcott); classroom learning (Channel One and Weekly Reader); speciality consumer magazines (Seventeen, Soap Opera Digest, Truckin', Crafts); technical and trade magazines (Ward's, Telephony); consumer directories (Apartment Guides, World Almanac), and business directories (Pacific Shipper, Bacon's).</p>
<p>"All of these businesses provide strong opportunities for organic growth and can be supplemented with product add-on acquisitions funded in part through our strong cash flow," said Reilly.</p>
<p>Separately, K-III said it planned a public offering of about 12.5 million shares. It said it anticipated the offering would be made in April.</p>
<p>Net proceeds will be used to redeem the company's outstanding $2.875 senior exchangeable preferred stock and to repay debt, the company said.</p>
<p>K-III stock was off 25 cents at $12.375 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
