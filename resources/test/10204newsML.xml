<p>Britain's blue chip stocks advanced to a new peak at Friday's opening, thanks to a 43-point rise in the Dow yesterday and the followthrough effect of yesterday's sizeable cut in the German repo rate, dealers said.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 started 16.5 points up at 3,907.6, beating the previous trading high of 3,894.4 made on August 21. "It's a squeezy market. But the fact that its gone through 3,900 in a reasonably big way is encouraging," a trader said.</p>
<p>Second line stocks were also higher, with the Mid-250 scoring a 9.1 points gain at 4,411.6, but standing nearly 160 points below its best closing level made in late April.</p>
