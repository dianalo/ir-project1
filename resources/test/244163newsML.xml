<p>European bourses were sharply higher on Monday and the dollar staged a rally as the markets decided Friday's global turmoil was an over-reaction.</p>
<p>London, Paris and Frankfurt all began more than one percent up before dropping back somewhat, awaiting Wall Street's opening for further direction.</p>
<p>The dollar strengthened more than half a pfennig, taking it back above the 1.55 mark level. Analysts said the European currency focus had switched from the shaky U.S. stock and bonds markets of last week to intensifying negotiations over European monetary union.</p>
<p>Shares plunged in a worldwide selloff on Friday, badly shaken by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warning about "irrational exuberance" in asset markets. The dollar and bonds were also dragged down.</p>
<p>But a partial bounce back by Wall Street after Europe closed on Friday sparked a recovery in Asian markets overnight and the recovering sentiment carried over into Europe. The Dow closed off just 55.16 points, up from an early nadir of around 145 points, or two percent, down.</p>
<p>London's blue chip FTSE 100 index rose over 40 points in early trade but slipped back a little on talk of an early election following the latest outbreak of tensions in the ruling Conservative Party.</p>
<p>The FTSE was still 30 points higher at 3,992 at noon GMT after ending Friday 88.2 points off at 3,963.0 -- its biggest one-day loss in percentage terms since February 1994.</p>
<p>Despite the recovery, analysts said sentiment had taken a severe knock and any gains were likely to be capped, particularly after renewed talk of an early election following the latest outbreak of tension in the ruling Conservative Party.</p>
<p>"There is every chance the market will try to go a bit better today but I doubt if it will make up all Friday's losses," said one senior equity salesman.</p>
<p>One main mover was EMI, which strengthened despite a denial from the company that it was in merger talks with Seagram's MCA music unit.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt early screen trading saw German stocks recover almost 1.5 percent and the trend continued in floor trade, where the DAX index rebounded by more than 2.5 percent before slipping slightly. By noon GMT it was still up 2.4 percent.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was relieved by the relatively limited losses on Wall Street on Friday, the recovery in Asia overnight and the firmer dollar, which makes German exports more attractive.</p>
<p>"I am totally bullish. The market had the weekend to digest what happened last week and is in far calmer form," said one Munich dealer.</p>
<p>It was a similar story in Paris, where shares started with an almost one percent bounce following their 2.26 percent drop on Friday. They later ran out of steam, giving back some of their opening gains, as dealers waited to see which way Wall Street would jump.</p>
<p>On the currency front, the dollar rallied as the market focus moved to monetary union developments.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and French President Jacques Chirac were meeting in Nuremberg ahead of the Dublin European Union summit next weekend, but even before the meeting Franco-German tensions were apparent.</p>
<p>Senior officials from Paris and Bonn made statements defending their divergent views on how to set up a "stability pact" to defend the planned currency, the euro.</p>
<p>By noon GMT, the dollar was trading at 1.5520 marks compared with 1.5465 late on Friday. Against the yen, it was at 113.20 compared with 112.95 late last week.</p>
<p>Bank of England governor Eddie George described the market response to the Greenspan speech as an overreaction, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Greenspan was merely raising a question about stock market levels.</p>
<p>Yet, while analysts and officials said the reaction to Greenspan's comments was exaggerated by year-end profit-taking, British analysts said the risks of a rate rise at the Fed's policy-making meeting on December 17 had risen, and that was boosting the dollar.</p>
<p>The dollar should gain support from talk of a further trimming of the key German securities repurchase rate and a pan-European desire for a stronger dollar against European currencies, they said.</p>
