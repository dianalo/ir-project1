<p>Some Italian-made mascarpone cream cheese may be contaminated with a bacterium that can cause life-threatening botulism, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Monday.</p>
<p>The FDA said the cheese, sold under the Giglio, Parmalat and Sol di Valle names, may contain Clostridium botulinum, a bacterium that can cause illness or death.</p>
<p>"Consumers are warned not to use the product for any purpose even it if does not look or smell spoiled," it said.</p>
<p>The agency said it was notified by the Italian Ministry of Health that these mascarpone brands had been linked to one death and at least three other cases of botulism there, and as a result, the products were being recalled in Italy.</p>
<p>Mascarpone is commonly used in tiramisu, an Italian dessert, and other dishes made with soft cheeses.</p>
<p>The FDA said that botulinum infection can cause symptoms such as general weakness, dizziness, double-vision, trouble with speaking or swallowing or difficulty in breathing.</p>
<p>People with those problems should seek immediate medical attention, the FDA said.</p>
<p>Italian authorities said some of the suspect product may have been exported to the United States and the FDA said it was working with the company and importers to try to track down the location of any imported product.</p>
