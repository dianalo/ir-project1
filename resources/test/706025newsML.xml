<p>The French and German foreign ministers got on their bikes on Thursday to try to show that the Bonn-Paris tandem at the heart of Europe was still in good working order.</p>
<p>Klaus Kinkel took his new French counterpart Hubert Vedrine on a bicycle tour alongside the Rhine. They rode on separate bicycles but they were at pains to stress that France and Germany were still working as a team.</p>
<p>"I think we have given you a good image. We cycled together in the same direction," Vedrine, who earlier held talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, told reporters on the river bank.</p>
<p>The Franco-German axis is widely perceived to be under considerable strain, particularly since the election last month of France's Socialist-led government.</p>
<p>But Kinkel said the cycle trip served as a metaphor to show they were working "alongside one another and at the same speed."</p>
<p>The ministers had the task of presenting a united front hours after French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said in Paris that France's public deficit could be "significantly higher" than 3.0 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>Senior German officials have indicated that it would be problematic for France to join Europe's planned single currency if the deficit is too far above the three percent limit set down in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>Kohl, the driving force behind the euro, has reiterated in the past few days that the "three" percent target laid down in the treaty means 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>In addition to economic and monetary union, Thursday's talks were expected to focus on next week's Madrid summit on NATO's eastward expansion.</p>
<p>Kinkel said he had already discussed the subject of NATO with Vedrine but he did not go into details.</p>
<p>After the cycle trip, the shirt-sleeved ministers boarded a cruise ship for a voyage on the river. They were due to give more information about their talks at a news conference later (1530 GMT).</p>
<p>Officials said the ministers also planned to issue a joint declaration on strengthening foreign policy cooperation.</p>
