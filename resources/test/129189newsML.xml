<p>Italy's Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Sunday that he saw Europe playing an increasingly important role in the stalled Middle East peace process which could complement U.S. efforts in the negotiations.</p>
<p>"I think that Europe...play quietly and slowly an increasingly important role. Not, of course, as an antagonist to the U.S. role. There is synergy," Prodi told reporters. "We feel our responsibility.</p>
<p>"We take seriously our role. I think now is the time to, I don't say force, but to push stronger the two parties" to implement the peace agreements, he said.</p>
<p>Prodi arrived in the Egyptian capital on Sunday on his first trip to the Middle East since he was appointed prime minister in May. He spoke to reporters at Arab League headquarters after talks with Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel Meguid.</p>
<p>Prodi is due to meet Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian counterpart Kamal Ganzouri before leaving on Monday.</p>
<p>Talks between Palestinians and Israelis on implementing Middle East peace deals have snagged on an overdue Israeli withdrawal from Hebron in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Prodi said he hoped "that this situation of high tension will in some way be better off in the near future".</p>
<p>Italy is eager to play a greater role in the peace process and earlier this month Palestinian President Yasser Arafat met Prodi to rally his support for the peace process.</p>
<p>Abdel-Meguid said Italy has shown "special interest" in Middle East peace. "We welcome that strongly," he said.</p>
<p>The Italian prime minister's visit is part of a flurry of diplomatic efforts by the European Union to boost its role in the peace talks, sponsored by the United States.</p>
<p>Arabs have traditionally seen the U.S. role in the Middle East as tilted towards Israel but the 15-nation bloc has said it would work, and not compete, with the American peace efforts.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac during a visit to Syria declared Middle East peace in danger on Saturday and said Europe must join Washington in sponsoring Arab-Israeli negotiations, contributing proposals and not just money.</p>
<p>Arab leaders have welcomed European involvement but Israel on Sunday rejected Chirac's demand that Europe be a co-sponsor.</p>
<p>Prodi said he hoped Israel's reluctance was temporary.</p>
<p>Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini will visit Israel on October 27 at the invitation of his counterpart David Levy.</p>
