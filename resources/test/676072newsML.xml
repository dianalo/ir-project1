<p>Russia has been admitted to the Paris Club of creditor nations, President Boris Yeltsin announced on Friday, and U.S. President Bill Clinton called it a "happy development".</p>
<p>Yeltsin told reporters of Russia's latest step toward full integration in the international financial community as he arrived for a meeting with Clinton before a three-day summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in Denver.</p>
<p>"We...have another happy development here today," Clinton said with a beaming Yeltsin sitting beside him. "Russia and the Paris Club have just completed their negotiations."</p>
<p>Clinton said this meant Russia would "now be a partner with the other members" in trying to promote global economic growth by relieving the debt of developing nations that adopt reforms.</p>
<p>"What you see here is a sweeping integration of Russia into the major decision-making networks of the world in a way that is very positive for the rest of us," Clinton said.</p>
<p>Russia, which inherited both the debts and the obligations of the former Soviet Union, has won a series of deals to reschedule Soviet-era debts.</p>
<p>It wanted to join the Paris Club as a creditor in an effort to win repayment of some debts extended to Soviet allies, most of them in the developing world.</p>
<p>Deputy U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said an agreement in principle on Russia's membership was hammered out in negotiations that lasted until the early hours of Friday morning.</p>
<p>"In a real sense, this agreement represents the financial end of the Cold War," he said.</p>
<p>Summers said that Russia would work with other Paris Club members "to collect debts owed where possible and to make appropriate adjustments where necessary. As part of the agreement, Moscow promised to adjust its debt claims on developing countries "between 30 and 80 percent," he said.</p>
<p>The United States has also pledged to support Russian entry to the World Trade Organisation and the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development.</p>
<p>But U.S. officials say Moscow has not yet taken all the necessary steps for admission to these bodies.</p>
<p>Asked if he wanted the G7 -- the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan -- to include Russia, Clinton said this was already effectively the case.</p>
<p>"Russia is fully included," he said. "This is the first time we've ever had a meeting that Russia was included in from beginning to end."</p>
<p>U.S. officials have gone out of their way to emphasise Moscow's enhanced role at the Denver summit, and it is being officially called "The Summit of the Eight."</p>
<p>In another gesture to underline Yeltsin's inclusion, Clinton arranged for him to lead off the discussion at the first event of the gathering, a working dinner on Friday evening.</p>
<p>But Yeltsin has been excluded from a session on Saturday at which the other leaders were to discuss coordination of their financial policies.</p>
<p>Besides discussing Russia's integration into international financial institutions, U.S. officials said Clinton and Yeltsin touched on NATO's planned expansion and its new friendly relationship with Moscow.</p>
<p>Yeltsin told Clinton he did not plan to attend next month's NATO summit in Madrid, but would send a senior representative, U.S. National Security Adviser Samuel Berger said. At that summit, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic are expected to be invited to join the western alliance.</p>
