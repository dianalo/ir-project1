<title>FRANCE: French aero stocks take off on Airbus deal.</title>
<headline>French aero stocks take off on Airbus deal.</headline>

<p>French aerospace shares rose on the Paris stock exchange on Thursday on the back of USAir's record order for 120 planes at Airbus Industrie, analysts said.</p>
<p>At 1436 GMT, Labinal gained 5.6 percent at 887 francs, Zodiac 2.23 percent at 1,556 francs and Intertechnique 3.80 percent at 820 francs.</p>
<p>Dassault Electronique, plus 4.62 percent, and Dassault Aviation, plus 6.64 percent, were also up but dealers said this was not related to Airbus.</p>
<p>"French aerospace companies such as Labinal, Zodiac and Intertechnique supply to Airbus but also to Boeing. Whenever there is a bid order for the one or the other they benefit from it," said Bertrand Larcena of brokers Oddo.</p>
<p>Transbourse's Jacques de Greling said Zodiac, which makes passenger evacuation slides and seats as well as inflatable dinghies, was "the best way to invest in the aerospace sector."</p>
<p>He said Zodiac was trading at 43 times its 1995/96 earnings.</p>
<p>"That's expensive but there are not many companies that can gurantee an annual growth rate of 15 percent in earnings per share," he added.</p>
