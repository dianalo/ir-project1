<p>Spanish government bonds continued their run higher on Thursday, with 10-year futures setting yet another record, as buyers remained ready to snap up paper despite the gains already achieved.</p>
<p>"Supports are being consolidated at ever higher levels and the future is breaking maximums," a dealer said. "Despite the accumulated gains there are still those ready to buy."</p>
<p>The market continued to be buoyed by views the 1997 budget - expected to be approved by the cabinet on Friday - would be austere and would persuade the Bank of Spain to reduce its 7.25 percent key money market rate soon.  </p>
<p>"People continue to be positive toward Spain," a dealer said. "There is a risk of a correction, but people don't seem to be ready to sell at the moment."</p>
