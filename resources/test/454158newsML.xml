<p>U.S. West Coast crude prices jumped Tuesday with West Texas Intermediate (WTI), after a barge accident and technical rally lifted futures markets, players said.</p>
<p>Talk was thin Tuesday, with most West Coast crude traders attending an industry function which runs through Tuesday.</p>
<p>Discounts for light grades were unchanged from Friday, with Alaska North Slope (ANS) last done at -$0.91 cents off WTI. Line 63 prices were idle at postings plus $0.95 to $1.00.</p>
<p>Technical strength and a shutdown of barge traffic on the Mississippi River sent NYMEX crude prices up $1.14 a barrel.  </p>
<p>Outright ANS prices tracked WTI's rise, ending $1.10 over yesterday at $20.99/21.19.</p>
<p>Nominations are due Wednesday for April shipments on Canada's Trans Mountain Pipe Line Co, a pipeline official said earlier.</p>
<p>Outright prices for Kern River remained flat after two deals at 20 cents off postings last week. The grade was steady at $14.38/14.48 a barrel Monday.</p>
