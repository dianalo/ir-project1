<p>The rough and tumble of Romanian politics has proved too much for former tennis star Ilie Nastase, who has walked out in disgust after suffering two dismal defeats at the polls.</p>
<p>Nastase, 50, said in an interview late on Thursday that tennis was a nicer game than election intrigues in his native Balkan country. He was so embittered that he did not even intend to vote in this weekend's presidential run-off.</p>
<p>"What we see now in the presidential elections, all this fighting and nothing concrete," said Nastase, who lost two bids for office on behalf of President Ion Iliescu's leftist party.</p>
<p>"I'm coming from a world of fair play, which is tennis, or sports, in general. I don't understand these things."</p>
<p>Iliescu faces a tough run-off battle to retain the presidency on Sunday against a reformist challenger. But Nastase said he would be away in Germany attending a men's ATP world championship tournament.</p>
<p>"I think there's going to be a change in politics. That's the way it looks like," said the tennis star, notorious for pranks on and off the courts in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Nastase, one-time winner of the French open, had said earlier that he was resigning from Iliescu's Party of Social Democracy, which he had joined ahead of this year's elections.</p>
<p>"My decision was based on what I saw in these six months in politics in Romania generally, not only in my party," he said.</p>
<p>A statement released to the media said he had been "dragged into a political quagmire. My parents were right to tell me as a child that politics do not marry well with morality."</p>
<p>Nastase lost a race for Bucharest mayor in June and for a seat in parliament in November 3 polls, when Iliescu's leftwingers were removed from government for the first time since the 1989 fall of communism.</p>
<p>"I didn't get enough support from my party, not even in the elections for mayor," he said of the PDSR, which drafted the former tennis star to revive its sagging electoral fortunes.</p>
<p>Nastase defended his unsuccessful, hard-fought run for the mayor's office in June, when his association with the president's party prompted attacks in local newspapers.</p>
<p>"First time in politics, and running for a party which was not very popular in Romania, I think it was great," he said.</p>
<p>In this month's parliamentary elections, the PDSR fielded him in an area dominated by ethnic Hungarians -- who are bitterly hostile to Iliescu and his party.</p>
<p>"I went to a part of Romania with 95 percent Hungarians," he said. "I knew I didn't have a chance. But I still went."</p>
