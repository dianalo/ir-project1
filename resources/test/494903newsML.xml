<p>Eastern German politicians warned of growing unemployment on Tuesday after the supreme court ruled that the region's farmers must repay about 10 billion marks ($5.8 billion) of communist-era debt.</p>
<p>The court, in a long-awaited decision meant to clear up some of the legal fallout from unification in 1990, said the cooperative farms' debts could not be relieved on the grounds they were different from western-style credit operations.</p>
<p>It also rejected the farms' argument that they could face ruin if forced to repay the debts, which they say were often imposed by state planners for non-farm work such as building roads, schools or public offices in their villages.</p>
<p>The DG Bank in Frankfurt, which is owed six billion of the 10 billion marks, hailed the ruling and the finance ministry said it would help to clear up legal uncertainties in the region.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Thierse, the leading eastern Social Democrat (SPD) deputy in the Bonn parliament, said: "The countryside is threatened with more unemployment."</p>
<p>Reinhard Hoeppner and Manfred Stolpe, the Social Democratic (SPD) premiers of Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg states, said the ruling would not help struggling farms.</p>
<p>"Some could give up and endanger important structures in their regions," they said in a statement. "With unemployment over 20 percent, nobody can want such a development."</p>
<p>The Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), the reformed successor to East Germany's hardline communists, said thousands of farmers could be hit by the ruling.</p>
<p>Bonn could have helped them, it said, but "any further state debt or loss of revenue had to be avoided because of the criteria for the introduction of the euro".</p>
<p>The government is trying to cut its budget deficit to qualify for economic and monetary union (EMU) and the introduction of the single European currency, the euro, scheduled for 1999.</p>
<p>While upholding Bonn's view of the debt, the court said the repayment burden could not be so heavy as to ruin a business. It said Bonn must review the procedures in the year 2000 to see if they worked well or saddled farms with even more debt.</p>
<p>The Federal Constitutional Court rejected an appeal by a collective farm in Saxony-Anhalt which said the debt repayment burden violated its members' rights to their property.</p>
<p>"The cooperative farms' duty to repay their old debts does not have any such effect," it said in its ruling.</p>
<p>The German-German Unity Treaty, hammered out at high speed in 1990, classified the debts as valid credits and allowed collective farms to repay them only after they showed a profit.</p>
<p>To limit the burden, farms in the black have to make payments only up to a limit of 20 percent of their annual profits.</p>
<p>The SPD's Hoeppner said forcing the farms to repay would ruin many of them and allow rich westerners to buy up the land. "Money will then flow from east to west. That cannot be a healthy structure," he told German Radio.</p>
<p>Eastern deputies from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU) gave the ruling a lukewarm greeting and stressed the government must now do what it could to ensure struggling farms get more support.</p>
<p>Bonn has shouldered many debts left over from east German industry and local governments by diverting them into a repayment fund independent of the government budget.</p>
<p>The court said Bonn could have done this for the farms but was not bound to "make up after the fact for all the losses suffered because of East Germany's economic system".</p>
<p>East Germany's farm sector, which because of its communist past still has far larger holdings than in the west, now employs only 150,000 of the 820,000 workers it originally had.</p>
<p>Land-privatising agencies must still settle disputes over more than 1.1 million hectares (2.7 million acres), a third of total arable land and forest.</p>
