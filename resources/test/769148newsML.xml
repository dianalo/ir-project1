<title>VENEZUELA: Venezuela gasoline prices to rise Thursday.</title>

<p>Venezuela is planning a controversial 27 percent hike in gasoline prices on Thursday, despite union plans for a general strike if the move goes ahead without salary increases.</p>
<p>It will be accompanied by a commensurate rise in subsidies to gasoline for public transport to ensure bus fares do not go up, said Luis Giusti, president of state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela.</p>
<p>Prices in Venezuela's domestic market are set by the Energy and Mines Ministry which has to keep them rising to keep pace with inflation, even though international prices have fallen over the past year.</p>
<p>But the issue is a hot political potato in Venezuela, a major oil exporter, and a sharp rise in 1989 caused widespread riots leaving over 300 dead, according to official figures.</p>
<p>The Confederation of Venezuelan Workers (CTV), Venezuela's main trade union, called for a general strike on August 6 to protest against the rise, in addition to delays in salary rises in the private sector.</p>
<p>The Ministry proposed an average 27 percent rise across the various grades of fuel, but will soon relinquish it price- setting role if Congress approves a government proposal to liberalise the market.</p>
<p>Low 87 octane leaded gasoline is set to rise by 10 bolivars (2 cents) to 60 bolivars (12 cents) per litre, medium 91 octane leaded will rise 15 bolivars (3 cents) to 70 bolivars (14 cents) per litre and high octane 95 leaded by 20 bolivars (4 cents) to 80 bolivars (16 cents) per litre.</p>
<p>The rise was deferred from July 17 due to technical reasons and will bring prices up to about 90 percent of factory gate levels.</p>
