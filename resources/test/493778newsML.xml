<p>Japan's ethylene production in March totalled 631,000 tonnes, up 14.2 percent from a year earlier as fewer ethylene plants were closed for routine maintenance this year, the Trade Ministry said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Only one ethylene centre was shut this March for maintenance checks, compared with three plants in March 1996, an official for the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.</p>
<p>While several petrochemical firms have been cutting ethylene output since earlier this year amid high naphtha prices, some other firms are believed to have stepped up production to meet Asia's growing demand for ethylene-derived petrochemical products, he added.</p>
