<p>The re-entry of Iraq into oil markets will not have a violent impact on oil prices which will weaken gradually over coming months, a top Venezuelan oil official said Friday.</p>
<p>"The entry of Iraq will obviously affect prices but not in a violent fashion," Claus Graf, vice-president of Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), told a breakfast meeting with journalists.</p>
<p>The basket of Venezuela's crudes and products has averaged nearly $18 per barrel in 1996, well above forecasts of $13.50 per barrel at the start of the year.</p>
<p>"We think that the current situation is not permanent... There will be a gradual reduction to about $15 per barrel next year," Graf said.</p>
<p>The Venezuelan government has based its 1997 budget on an average oil price of $14 per barrel.</p>
