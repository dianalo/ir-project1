<p>India must allow free imports and exports of gold and liberalise trade in it to boost industrial and employment growth, senior government officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>"The major objective of the new gold policy should perhaps be to recognise the importance of gold in the Indian economic system," Y.V. Reddy, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), told a gold seminar in the Indian capital.</p>
<p>"(The policy) should enable gold to play a transparent and positive role in the industrial development, employment and export sectors of the economy," Reddy said.</p>
<p>Reddy said India should allow free imports and exports of gold and give up its present system of trade through designated agencies. Currently state-run State Bank of India and MMTC Ltd are the only entities permitted to import gold.</p>
<p>"Free import under open general licence and free exports are pre-conditions for capturing world markets," Reddy said.</p>
<p>He said most South Asian nations had liberalised gold imports, charging nominal duties. "This development makes it imperative that we review our policies urgently."</p>
<p>India is the world's largest consumer of gold, although nearly a third of its 900 million people live below the poverty line with the average per-capita income at around $330 a year.</p>
<p>The country's annual consumption of gold is estimated at around 500 tonnes, 80 percent of it imported.</p>
<p>P.P. Prabhu, the highest-ranking civil servant in the Commerce Ministry, told the seminar organised by the World Gold Council that much progress had been made in liberalising gold trade since 1991 when India launched an ambitious economic reforms programme.</p>
<p>"(But) of course the regime is still not very open," Prabhu added.</p>
<p>He said gold imported by smuggling was down to about 100-120 tonnes per year since India allowed non-resident Indians to bring in up to five kgs of gold each time they come to the country, subject to a certain duty. The limit was raised to 10 kgs in 1997.</p>
<p>"There is a significant reduction compared to early days when the percentage of smuggled gold was estimated to be more than 50 percent of the total consumption," Prabhu added.</p>
<p>S.S. Tarapore, chairman of an RBI committee on capital account rupee convertibility, said India needed to immediately free gold imports for effective macroeconomic and exchange rate management.</p>
<p>"In fact, from the view point of macroeconomic management, and in particular exchange rate management, a salutary measure would be an immediate freeing up of gold imports," Tarapore told the seminar.</p>
<p>Tarapore said world gold stocks were estimated at 132,000 tonnes at the end of 1996, of which official stocks were about 33,000 tonnes. Gold stocks in India were estimated at 8,000-12,000 tonnes, of which official stocks were only 400 tonnes. The rest is in private hands.</p>
<p>"Gold continues to be a preferred hold in a number of major countries," Tarapore said. "There is no reason for India to reduce the share of gold in its reserves."</p>
<p>Tarapore said India had to free gold imports before moving to full rupee convertibility on the capital account.</p>
<p>"As India moves to capital account convertibility, it would need to shed its inhibitions and aversion for an active gold policy by the RBI," he said.</p>
<p>Prabhu said the RBI had already laid down guidelines for nominating more banks to import and sell gold, and a number of new agencies would be soon permitted to import it.</p>
