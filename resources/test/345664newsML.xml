<p>Raytheon Co on Wednesday said that it was part of a group that signed a letter of intent to build a $480 million power plant in India.</p>
<p>The award is for a 525-megawatt coal-fired power plant in Tuticorin in the state of Tamil Nadu, Raytheon said. The plant will be built for Southern Petrochemicals Industries Corp's electric power unit.</p>
<p>Raytheon, the project manager, said Singapore-based Jurong Engineering Ltd and Deutsche Babcock Energie-und Umwelttechnik AG were also part of the group.</p>
<p>Raytheon's portion of the work is valued at about $210 million, the company said.</p>
<p>The power plant, which is expected to go into operation in 2001, will sell the electricity it generates to the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, the state-owned utility, Raytheon said.</p>
<p>The plant will be constructed adjacent to a 1,050-megawatt plant owned by the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board, Raytheon said.</p>
