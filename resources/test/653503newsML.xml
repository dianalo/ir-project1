<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures moved lower late Wednesday in lethargic trade, with spot-July pressured near key support as longs bailed ahead of the weekly gas inventory report later today, sources said.</p>
<p>At 1425 EDT, July slipped 3.2 cents to $2.09 per million British thermal units, while August was three cents lower at $2.125. Most others were down by 0.2 to 2.5 cents.</p>
<p>"I really expected to see some downward pressure late today ahead of the AGA number. The longs are afraid of a bearish build," said one East Coast trader, noting weather forecasts were not supportive despite some heat this week.  </p>
<p>Despite a minor heat wave in the Midwest and Northeast this week, extended weather forecasts expected it to be short-lived, dashing bullish hopes for an early summer rally, at least for now.</p>
<p>But many doubted prices would crumble much further, noting injections were likely to continue at a decent pace near-term and summer was still ahead.</p>
<p>"There's not enough out there to break it out of the range either way," said one Houston-based trader.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll showed most expected a weekly AGA stock build in the 90-100 bcf range versus an 88 bcf gain last year.</p>
<p>More seasonal weather is forecast for the Midwest and Northeast by the weekend and expected to last into next week. The Southeast also was expected to be mostly normal, with Florida climbing to above-normal levels.</p>
<p>Technical traders noted July broke minor support at $2.10 today but pegged $2.08 as the more important number. A break through $2.08 should set up a test of psychological support at $2. Resistance was seen first at $2.21, then at $2.25, $2.37 and the contract high at $2.44.</p>
<p>In the cash, swing gas in the Louisiana Gulf was unchanged Wednesday in the mid-teens. Midcon pipes also held steady in the low-$2s. New York city gate gas was flat at about $2.43.</p>
<p>NYMEX said 16,752 contracts traded at 1305 EDT.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, July was still down by 2.5 cents at $1.96, while deferreds remained mixed. The East/West spread narrowed by 0.7 cent to 13.0 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
