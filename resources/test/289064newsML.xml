<p>Harbinger Corp said Monday it bought SupplyTech Inc, a supplier of EDI software and services, in stock deal valued at about $44 million.</p>
<p>Harbinger said it will take a first-quarter charge of $7.5-$10 million for acquisition expenses in the deal, which it said will be "accretive to earnings in 1997, exclusive of the charge."  </p>
<p>Harbinger said it will issue 1.6 million new common shares in exchange for 100 percent of the privately-held Michigan company. Harbinger said it will have 13.5 million fully diluted shares outstanding after the issue.</p>
<p>EDI software, or electric data interchange software, is used in electronic commerce to connect large companies with their suppliers, trading partners and customers.</p>
<p>Harbinger said the merger makes it the second largest independent supplier of standards-based electronic commerce software and services in North America.  </p>
<p>On a proforma basis, the combined companies had more than $60 million in revenue for the year ended December 31, Harbinger said.</p>
<p>Harbinger said the merger will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.</p>
<p>Harbinger closed Friday at 27-5/8.</p>
