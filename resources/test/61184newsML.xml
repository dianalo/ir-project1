<p>Two generals, including a deputy defence minister, and 16 other officials were fired in an attack against corruption, the government said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"This is an unprecedented purge," Nery Morales, spokesman for the interior ministry, told reporters. Those fired included police officers, three army colonels and customs officials.</p>
<p>The dismissals followed last weekend's arrest of Alfredo Moreno Molina, a former military intelligence officer and the suspected boss of a smuggling and robbery ring.</p>
<p>The police, army and customs officials arrested were all suspected of connection to Moreno's alleged criminal network.</p>
<p>The purge came on the eve of a historic peace treaty to be signed on Thursday in Mexico City by the government and leftist rebels, which will cut the powerful army by one third as a condition of peace at the end of Guatemala's 36-year civil war.</p>
<p>Guatemalan military personnel suspected of crimes have traditionally enjoyed impunity and have mostly evaded the justice system.</p>
<p>Chief of police Angel Conte Cojulun told reporters the attorney general's office was investigating possible criminal charges against all of the officials and will issue arrest warrants.</p>
<p>Col. Edgar Palacios, an army spokesman, said the dismissed army officers were all confined to military barracks and would be turned over to the justice system pending investigations and arrest warrants.</p>
<p>Several of the military officers rounded up in this week's corruption investigations were previously linked to prominent cases of human rights abuses.</p>
<p>The fired deputy defence minister, Gen. Cesar Augusto Garcia Gonzalez, had been linked to a possible cover-up related to the 1992 disappearance of guerrilla commander Efrain Bamaca, whose wife, Jennifer Harbury, pressured the White House to investigate CIA involvement in assassinations in Guatemala.</p>
