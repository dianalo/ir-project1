<p>Convicted ex-Nazi officer Erich Priebke said on Thursday he would fight a court order to move him from an Italian hillside monastery and make him serve the rest of his jail sentence in an army hospital.</p>
<p>Priebke, who received a five-year sentence from a military court last month for his role in Italy's worst World War Two atrocity, has been living under house arrest in the Franciscan monastery since last year.</p>
<p>"(The court's) decision is abnormal, an abuse of power, an attempt to clean consciences," Priebke was quoted as saying in an interview published in the newspaper Il Giornale.</p>
<p>The Franciscan order had stipulated that the 84-year-old German should leave their care after the trial ended and Priebke's lawyers had requested that he be moved to the home of right-wing activist Paolo Giachini.</p>
<p>A military court said on Wednesday that Priebke must go to Rome's Celio hospital.</p>
<p>"Without anyone requesting it, without there being any reason to do it, they're transferring me to Celio. I'll fight against this umpteenth injustice," Priebke said, adding that the move could seriously endanger his health.</p>
<p>"My neuro-psychiatrist is completely opposed to my moving to a hospital. He thinks this could have an irreversible impact on my health, which is already suffering," he told Il Giornale.</p>
<p>Priebke was extradited to Italy in November 1995 from Argentina, where he had lived openly for almost half a century, and has been held in custody ever since.</p>
<p>The former SS captain said he desperately wanted to see his wife, who has remained in Argentina.</p>
<p>"After all this time I miss terribly the warmth of my family, especially my wife," Priebke said. "The only thing I really want to do before dying is to embrace her."</p>
<p>Priebke was sentenced to jail for participating in a 1944 massacre in which SS soldiers rounded up 335 men and boys and shot them in caves outside Rome in retaliation for a partisan attack on German occupying forces.</p>
<p>The conviction came at the end of a lengthy retrial after another tribunal acquitted him last August. That decision sparked outrage in Italy's Jewish community.</p>
<p>Priebke was immediately re-arrested and a fresh trial was ordered.</p>
<p>Priebke, who has admitted he took part in the massacre, told Il Giornale his conviction was "incomprehensible".</p>
<p>"This sentence is without doubt less courageous than the first... the judges have given in to intolerable political pressure," he said.</p>
<p>He repeated his claim that he was only following orders when he participated in the killings, and said he sympathised with the victims' relatives.</p>
<p>"For me, as it would be for anyone with a conscience, the massacre was a personal tragedy, a horrible thing," he said.</p>
