<p>Texas Instruments Inc chief economist Vladi Catto said the global semiconductor industry was close to hitting bottom and could see an upturn in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>"It looks like we may be on schedule for a fourth quarter upturn," Catto told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>"The deterioration is definitely slowing and it is slowing to the point where it appears to have reached a trough," he said. "There is room for cautious optimism."  </p>
<p>Catto said the U.S. semiconductor industry's improved book-to-bill ratio in August would likely continue in coming months and pointed to an improvement in end-equipment markets for chips.</p>
<p>He said personal computer sales rose in July and looked to be firm in August and September.</p>
<p>"I don't think we need to worry at this point about weakness on the demand side," he said. "Demand is present and it is sufficiently strong, I think, to pull the semiconductor industry out of its weakness as soon as inventories are under control."  </p>
<p>Excessive inventories forced a dramatic reduction in the price of common memory chips earlier this year.</p>
<p>Catto said it was difficult to see what was happening to chip inventories, especially in Japan, Korea and Taiwan, but he was optimistic about improvement.</p>
<p>"It appears that sometime before the end of this year inventories will be under control, not only in the United States but in other countries as well, and the industry may begin to recover," he said.</p>
