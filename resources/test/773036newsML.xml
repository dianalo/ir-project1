<p>Valero Energy Corp will push ahead with  refinery expansions and acquisitions now that it has shed its natural  gas pipeline operations, chairman and chief executive officer Bill  Greehey said on Friday.</p>
<p>Greehey told Reuters in an interview the company would likely spend  $100 million a year on refinery upgrades for the next two to three  years and was searching for acquisition candidates.</p>
<p>He also said he expected to beat analyst estimates that Valero would  earn $0.65 in the third quarter and $2.10 in all of 1997.  </p>
<p>On Thursday, Valero completed the $1.5 billion sale of its natural  gas pipeline operations to PG&amp;E Corp. Earlier this year it bought  Salomon Inc's Basis Petroleum Inc unit, which included a 165,000 barrel-per-day  (BPD) refinery in Texas City, an 85,000 BPD facility in Houston, and  an 65,000 BPD plant in Krotz Springs, La.</p>
<p>Valero already had a 171,500 BPD refinery in Corpus Christi, Texas,  which uses heavy residual oil to make reformulated gasoline.</p>
<p>Greehey said engineering was underway for expansions and upgrades  at the refineries.  </p>
<p>"At Texas City and Houston we're looking at increasing the size of  the crude units. We're looking at the (catalytic) cracker in Texas  City and maybe making it into a heavy oil cracker like the one we  have in Corpus Christi," he said.</p>
<p>"We're looking at the next turnaround of our heavy oil cracker in  Corpus (to) maybe making some modifications to improve the capacity,"  Greehey said.</p>
<p>"So I would say that, capital-wise, we're probably talking about $100  million a year to take care of internal expansion," he said. That  spending would be maintained "probably at least a minimum of two,  probably three years."  </p>
<p>"All of this will not hit earnings until 1998 because you've got that  kind of a lead time for expansion," he said.</p>
<p>Greehey said Valero was evaluating other refineries around the country  with an eye toward purchase, "but we have not actively started negotiating  on anything." He said he wanted to buy new assets "as quickly as possible"  because refining margins may be on the verge of long upward cycle.</p>
<p>"I've always thought this was the year that margins were really going  to start improving and that they would continue to improve," he said.  "There's a window of opportunity. The faster you can get deals done,  the better deals you'll get."</p>
<p>Greehey said the former Basis refineries were producing much greater  profits than Valero had expected, which would show up in this year's  net income.</p>
<p>Some analysts have "got us at 65 cents for the third quarter and maybe  $2.10 for the year, and I think we're going to do better than that,"  he said.</p>
<p>He said the company had no plans to get into the gasoline retail business.</p>
<p>"I don't think retail is going to come on the radar screen. The cost  of entry is high. Directionally, there is a lot of concern about where  retail is going," he said.</p>
