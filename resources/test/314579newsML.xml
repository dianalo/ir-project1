<p>Polish pharmaceutical company Polfa Kutno SA said in a statement on Friday it expected to net 19.5 million zlotys on sales of 239 million zlotys in 1997.</p>
<p>It said it expected its pre-tax profit to reach 30 million zlotys.</p>
<p>The company has not yet published results for the whole of 1996 and after the first 11 months it had made a net profit of 14.1 million zlotys and a pre-tax profit of 22.2 million on sales of 156.9 million zlotys.</p>
<p>Polfa also said it would spend 43 million zlotys this year on its mid-term investment programme aimed at increasing production and achieving the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) international quality standard.</p>
<p>Polfa also said it was considering shedding its veterinary products division but so far no decision had been made.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday the daily Rzeczpospolita said the stock's recent rise might have been triggered by speculation that it was planning to sell its veterinary division and bid for a drug company undergoing privatisation.</p>
<p>But Polfa denied in the statement that it had any plans of investing in Polish pharmaceutical companies offered by the treasury ministry.</p>
