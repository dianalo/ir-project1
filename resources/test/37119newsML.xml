<headline>FOCUS-Brazil ends meet in chill of debt warnings.</headline>

<p>Brazil Thursday ended its first-ever international seminar on public finances with the unsettling ring of debt warnings from international economic luminaries hanging in the air.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Pedro Malan took heed of the doom-and-gloom merchants and acknowledged that the great challenge Brazil faced in the future was consolidating its "Plano Real" economic stabilization plan and modernizing the state.</p>
<p>"There's a lot that remains to be done," he said.  </p>
<p>The grim tone was set by the International Monetary Fund's director of fiscal affairs, Vitor Tanzi.</p>
<p>He said Monday Brazil's current interest rate levels combined with annual economic growth of 3.0-4.0 percent and a primary budget surplus of only 1.0 percent of gross domestic product would cause substantial growth in debt.</p>
<p>Tanzi added that the results of an IMF study on Brazil's total debt were "worrisome", without going into details.</p>
<p>Brazil's net public sector debt in June stood at 33.9 percent of GDP, with net internal debt of 210.7 billion reais reaching 29.6 percent of GDP.  </p>
<p>The IMF words of warning were echoed by Ricardo Hausmann, chief economist at the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).</p>
<p>"We would like to see Brazil accumulate debt at a much lower speed than it is currently doing," Hausmann told Reuters.</p>
<p>Brazilian officials, while acknowledging all was not well, played down their comments.</p>
<p>Francisco Lopes, monetary policy director of the Central Bank, told reporters Brazil had to increase its primary surplus to stop its debt stockpile from growing.  </p>
<p>But he dismissed as "exaggerated" suggestions a surplus of 3.0-4.0 percent was needed to prevent "a debt explosion".</p>
<p>Lopes said Brazil only needed a primary budget surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP to halt debt growth in its tracks.</p>
<p>He added that commentators on Brazil's debt had to take account of one-off distortions, like federal Banco do Brasil's 7.8 billion real first half 1996 loss and plans to securitize a $50 billion black hole in the federal FCVS housing fund.</p>
<p>The four-day seminar, held to mark the 10th anniversary of the creation of the National Treasury Secretariat, ended as it began -- with mutual backslapping by Brazilian officials.  </p>
<p>President Fernando Henrique Cardoso took the opportunity Monday to play domestic politics, eloquently praising arch-foe and former president Jose Sarney for having set up the Treasury.</p>
<p>A beaming Sarney responded with some self-congratulation.</p>
<p>"When you drink from a well, it is good to remember who built it," he said, quoting what he said was a Chinese proverb.</p>
<p>It was left to Malan, regarded in Brasilia as a pragmatist technician and not the smoothest political operator, to bring up the subject at hand -- public finances.</p>
<p>"Everything Tanzi said is part of what we talk about everyday in the government. There is nothing in his text that I disagree with. In fact, we have a great convergence of views on what is happening in Brazil," he said at the opening ceremony.</p>
