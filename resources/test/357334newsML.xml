<headline>NYMEX heating oil ends off on increasing output.</headline>

<p>NYMEX heating oil extended its decline Wednesday after oil inventory data showed higher distillate output when heating oil supply was already deemed ample amid mild weather.</p>
<p>"The main feature of the day was weakness in the refined product contracts, with refinery runs up more than one percent when distributors are trying to de-stock heat," said Jim Ritterbusch, a dealer with Sweeney Oil.</p>
<p>March heat ended off 0.86 cent at 63.32 cents after falling 1.10 cents Tuesday. March gasoline ended off 0.77 cent a gallon at 67.54 cents.  </p>
<p>March crude ended off 11 cents at $23.91 a barrel.</p>
<p>Crude's declines were limited by higher refinery operating rates amid relatively tight crude supply, dealers said.</p>
<p>Oil inventory data released by American Petroleum Institute (API) on Tuesday said crude stocks were down 9.60 million barrels below a year ago for the week ended January 31.</p>
<p>The API said refinery capacity utilization rates rose 1.2 percentage points for the week to 90.3 percent when traders had been expecting the rate to decline by 0.5 percentage point.</p>
<p>Dealers said the higher run rate combined with gasoline stocks growing a larger-than-expected 2.9 million barrels led to selling in the refined product crack spreads.</p>
<p>The March gasoline to crude crack fell to $4.48 a barrel from $4.67 Tuesday while the March heating oil crack spread fell to $2.70 a barrel from $2.94 Tuesday.</p>
<p>According to the API data, output of distillate, which includes heating oil and diesel, grew to 3.20 million barrels from 3.10 million just when distillate stocks were showing a surplus with year ago levels for the first time since June 1995.</p>
<p>Heating oil output grew to 1.40 million barrels from 1.37 million barrels.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, mild temperatures in the northeastern United States, the largest heating oil market in the world, are tempering heat demand, dealers said.</p>
<p>Independent forecaster Weather Services Corp expected temperatures to average normal to above normal through the weekend in the Northeast.</p>
