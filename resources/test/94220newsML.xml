<p>Madrid stocks closed lower on Thursday after the Bank of Spain cut its key money rate 50 basis points to 6.75 percent, as most had expected.</p>
<p>The losses were interpreted as much-needed consolidation and most continue to expect the bourse to test new highs soon.</p>
<p>Caution may well set the tone on Friday however, with all eyes on the release of September U.S. non-farm payroll.</p>
<p>The general index fell 1.35 points, 0.36 percent to 370.48 and the Ibex shed 18.53 points, 0.43 percent to 4,243.86.</p>
<p>Hypermarket Pryca fell 110 pesetas to 3,000 after it said on Wednesday that gross sales to September fell 0.3 percent.</p>
<p>The key rate cut had been widely anticipated, setting off profit-taking after various sessions of highs. But the bourse has further to go on prospects for more monetary easing this year, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The market has all the ingredients to go up again, but it might take a certain time," said one trader.</p>
<p>Volume, boosted by non-resident investors, totalled 33 billion pesetas.</p>
