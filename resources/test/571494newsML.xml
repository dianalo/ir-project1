<p>Clean tanker rates rose in the Mediterranean this week on good enquiry and a lack of tonnage, brokers said on Friday.</p>
<p>Med gas oil rates rose above naphtha, breaking through the W200 level early in the week for 30,000 tonne cargoes but naphtha eventually achieved W230 for 27,250 tonnes.</p>
<p>Inter-U.K./Cont 25,000 tonne clean cargoes were steady at W190/195, but there was little gasoline fixing trans-Atlantic with one owner paying as low as W210 for 33,000 tonnes, brokers said.</p>
<p>But there was interest in moving gas oil east, with large parcels of 75,000 tonnes and 77,000 tonnes from Ventspils to Singapore said fixed on subjects for $1.75 million.</p>
<p>In the Middle East, clean rates stayed soft with 28,000/29,000 tonnes to India falling to around W182.5.</p>
<p>Long-haul voyages also remained in the doldrums at about W172.5. Brokers E.A. Gibson said that "with the lack of activity in this market and tonnage building up in the Middle East, rate levels are not expected to rise in the coming week."</p>
<p>They said prompter tonnage was also ailing with 72,000 tonnes Singapore/Indonesia fetching W135. "Whilst these spot vessels remain unfixed, one can assume that rates will continue to fall," Gibson added.</p>
<p>The Caribbean also suffered from a surfeit of tonnage, with 30,000 tonnes falling to W245 from W265 earlier in the week.</p>
