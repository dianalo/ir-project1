<p>Prominent Chinese dissident Wang Dan, jailed last year for plotting to overthrow the government, is seeking medical parole after developing what could be a nervous condition, his mother said on Monday.</p>
<p>Wang's parents applied in late June to authorities at his prison in northeastern Liaoning province to release him for medical treatment after he was affected by dizziness and headaches, his mother Wang Lingyun said.</p>
<p>"The application was made according to his present physical state, because examinations have shown he is suffering from a serious illness," Wang Lingyun said by telephone.</p>
<p>"I made the application last month without him knowing about it," she said, adding that her son had since consented to the application.</p>
<p>Prison authorities had refused to let doctors diagnose the new sickness but an outside physician who was told about Wang's symptoms said it could be a nervous disorder and recommended a brain scan, she said.</p>
<p>"He gets dizzy and cannot read books for a long period of time," she said.</p>
<p>Wang Dan was also still suffering from the throat infections that had plagued him since the start of his incarceration, she said.</p>
<p>"Everytime he is examined the doctors diagnose it and say it is pretty serious and... after repeated infections there is the possibilty of them becoming even worse," she said.</p>
<p>"According to regulations, if you develop two illnesses you can qualify for medical parole," she said.</p>
<p>Authorities had not yet responded to the request for parole and the family was uncertain if the plea would be granted, she said.</p>
<p>Wang Lingyun said in April she did not believe her son would get a chance to seek medical treatment abroad, an opportunity China has granted to other jailed dissidents.</p>
<p>Wang, 27, was sentenced last year to 11 years in prison for plotting to overthrow the government.</p>
<p>Western officials have repeatedly appealed for his release but Beijing has dismissed foreign criticism of its human rights record as interference in its internal affairs.</p>
<p>Wang spent four years in jail for his leading role in 1989 student-led demonstrations in Beijing that were crushed by the military on June 3-4 of that year with heavy loss of life.</p>
<p>He emerged from prison uncowed and was detained in May 1995 for 17 months before his sentencing by a Beijing court last October.</p>
