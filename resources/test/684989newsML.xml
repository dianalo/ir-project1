<p>Shares in chemical group ICI Australia Ltd on Tuesday closed sharply higher on light volume on the eve of a major offering of the stock to local investors.</p>
<p>ICI Australia ended at A$13 (US$9.75), up 40 cents on Monday's close, with only 106,301 shares changing hands in a weaker market.</p>
<p>The closing price takes the shares above the level they were trading at when, on May 7, its British parent Imperial Chemical Industries Plc announced it would sell its 62.4 percent stake in the Australian subsidiary.</p>
<p>Despite the huge share sale, ICI Australia's share price has rallied strongly and is near its 12-month high of A$13.40.</p>
<p>Brokers attributed the share rise to both light volume and strong demand from retail investors.</p>
<p>The retail component of ICI Plc's offer opens on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"I have not heard anything about a takeover but, with the market where it is (at record highs), I think there is a lot of retail demand," one broker told Reuters.</p>
<p>Recently released brokerage reports had been quite bullish on the stock as well, he added.</p>
<p>ICI Plc plans to sell about 52 percent of ICI Australia in the offer, with the rest of its stake to be sold back to the company under a buy-back agreement.</p>
<p>The offer carries no restrictions and ICI Plc says it is still open to a single bid for the entire stake.</p>
<p>Tuesday's closing price valued ICI Plc's total 62.4 percent shareholding in ICI Australia at A$2.4 billion.</p>
<p>(A$1 = US$0.75)</p>
