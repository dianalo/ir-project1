<p>The U.S. Agriculture Department Tuesday said would allow pork and pork products from the Mexican state of Baja California to transit the U.S. for export to other countries.</p>
<p>USDA said the pork must be packaged in Baja California in a leakproof container and sealed with serial number approved by USDA's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS).</p>
<p>Currently, pork products from Sonora, Chihuahua and Yucatan states are allowed to transit the U.S. for export.</p>
<p>Earlier, as part of President Clinton's state visit to Mexico, the U.S. said it would recognize Sonora state as a low risk area for hog cholera and thereby allow imports of fresh and frozen pork from Sonora to U.S. markets.</p>
