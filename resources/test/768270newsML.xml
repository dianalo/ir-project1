<p>A bankruptcy judge Thursday approved $1 billion in debtor-in-possession financing for Montgomery Ward Holding Corp to allow the ratailer to keep its stores running during a reorganization.</p>
<p>Judge Peter Walsh said he would sign an order approving the loan after General Electric Co's GE Capital unit withdrew a restriction on the loan at the request of the retailer's creditors.  </p>
<p>GE Capital owns 57 percent of Montgomery Ward and all of the retailer's private-label credit card.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, GE agreed to loan Montgomery Ward $1 billion to help it pay for inventory and to fund operations during its Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.</p>
<p>GE had sought as a condition to the loan a guarantee that it could continue to operate the profitable credit card business. The retailer's private-label credit card represents 50 percent of its retail sales.  </p>
<p>"Without a private-label credit card program in place, we would have difficulty moving forward," David Kurtz, an attorney for Montgomery Ward, said during a hearing in U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware.</p>
<p>Creditors objected to the condition of the loan because they wanted time to review the credit card agreements.</p>
<p>The creditors, which include the retailer's banks, want to be sure the 408-store chain is not being unfarily charged by GE Capital for credit card services, thus decreasing the company's value and the payout available to them in a reorganization.</p>
<p>A hearing has been set for September 10 to determine whether the credit card agreements should be revised or be replaced with a new arrangements with more favorable terms.</p>
