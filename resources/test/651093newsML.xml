<p>Irish bonds opened marginally better in moderate two-way trade on Tuesday as investors backtracked slightly on their response to yesterday's EMU fears, dealers said.</p>
<p>"There's a feeling today that the reaction to the French stability pact request was a little overdone," one dealer said. "This morning we saw people unwinding flattening trades -- buying back the longer end and selling the short end -- on the grounds that it wasn't as serious as it initially looked."</p>
<p>By 1500 GMT, the 6.5 percent bond due 2001 had slipped back five pence at 101.50 to yield 6.08 percent, while the eight percent bond due 2006 was unchanged from the previous close at 108.50 to yield 6.72 percent.</p>
<p>Yields against German Bunds were broadly unchanged at 167 basis points over in the five-year bond, and 93 over in the 10-year, traders said.</p>
<p>On Monday, new French finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn requested from EU counterparts a period of reflection before signing the stability pact which sets out fines for countries not keeping their budget deficits in order.</p>
<p>That sparked immediate speculation about a delay for EMU or a fudging of the criteria.</p>
<p>"I think that, overnight, people have realised that the French are talking about add-ons after the start of EMU rather than re-negotiations," a dealer said. "Some still believe we're looking at a delay to the timetable but in general people are betting on a softer euro starting on time."</p>
<p>The EU Commission's De Silguy on Tuesday called on EU leaders to agree the stability pact at next week's summit, despite France's request for more time.</p>
<p>Dealers said that despite quieter trade in the afternoon, Irish bonds were helped by peripheral European markets pushing ahead, outperforming against Germany.</p>
<p>A firmer Irish pound and fresh rumours of a revaluation had triggered some renewal of foreign interest.</p>
<p>Negotiations to form a new government continued following the weekend's cliffhanger election, with markets reasonably confident of political stability ahead.</p>
<p>Irish CPI figures due on Thursday should be supportive of the market, dealers said.</p>
