<p>Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing called on Tuesday for more land to be made available for development when the territory reverts to Chinese rule this year so that more people could afford their own homes.</p>
<p>Li, one of the world's richest men, said he expected the post-colonial government which takes over on July 1 to boost supply to keep property prices in line with inflation.</p>
<p>That way "property developers can make reasonable profits and more people can afford to buy their own homes", Li told the weekly Asian Business magazine in an interview.</p>
<p>"That's a happy society and that's what I like," said Li, chairman and managing director of Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd and chairman of blue chip Hutchison Whampoa Ltd.</p>
<p>Li said he had consistently called on the government for the past 20 years to increase the supply of land available for development to stabilise prices.</p>
<p>Under a Sino-British agreement the supply of land released by the Hong Kong government up to the 1997 handover is limited to 50 hectares a year.</p>
<p>Li's comments follow criticism of government policy on land supply by another Hong Kong tycoon, Henry Fok.  </p>
<p>Fok was quoted by the South China Morning Post newspaper on Tuesday as accusing the government of pushing property prices to an unacceptably high level.</p>
<p>Fok said the government's land policy had pushed property prices up more than tenfold in the past decade.</p>
<p>Residential property prices in Hong Kong have been rising in recent months on the back of strong speculative interest, and luxury flats can cost more than HK$10,000 per square foot. -- Hong Kong News Room (852) 2843 6368</p>
