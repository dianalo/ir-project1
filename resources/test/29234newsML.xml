<p>Trade has resumed on Ukraine's grain market after the lifting of a government order to some elevators to lock up grain and prevent exports, industry sources said.</p>
<p>"They've got their grain, so they're lifting the ban," said Bohdan Chomiak, a representative of the Washington-based Chemonics research group in Kiev.</p>
<p>A senior agriculture ministry official told Reuters the grain market was moving again since the state had bought what it needed to ensure domestic supplies.</p>
<p>The government has said it hopes to export three million tonnes, probably to neighbours like Russia.</p>
<p>"The situation on the grain market is changing," the official said, adding that forward contracts were being filled and new contracts were being purchased.</p>
<p>The government earlier denied it had officially ordered state-owned elevators to keep grain locked up until its own orders were filled, but said such instructions may have been issued informally at lower government levels in some provinces.</p>
<p>Even so grain trading on Ukraine's 22 exchanges ground to a halt last month, and industry sources accused the government of quietly ordering the provinces to hold onto supplies.</p>
<p>Chomiak said that while forward contracts purchased in May and June were being fulfilled, brokers were liable for breach of contract without written government evidence of force majeure.</p>
<p>"The problem was the way they did it -- if only they had just said something," Chomiak said. "People were stuck with contracts they couldn't fulfil." he said.</p>
<p>Ukraine has forecast the 1996 grain harvest at 28 million tonnes -- the lowest since the late 1940s -- after a severe drought this year.</p>
<p>Only about eight percent of grain is bought and sold on the relatively new exchange system. The rest is bartered for fuel and machinery, used as animal feed or sold to the government.</p>
<p>The agriculture ministry official said low grain quality was a concern, adding, "People will be eating poorer-quality bread and the grain sold in export contracts will be of worse quality than what is traditional for Ukraine."</p>
<p>Russia's Interfax news agency said on Tuesday the government had agreed to the use of the lowest class of wheat for bread.</p>
<p>Previously, so-called class-five wheat was used only as animal feed.</p>
