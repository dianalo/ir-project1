<p>British property group MEPC Plc said on Thursday it expected property values to rise, at least in line with inflation, over the next two years and more widespread rental growth during 1997.</p>
<p>MEPC, which announced increased pretax profits for the year of 140.0 million pounds ($231.3 million) but a fall in net asset value (NAV) per share, to 450 pence from 457 pence, said improved sentiment had yet to be reflected in asset values.  </p>
<p>The company said its priorities for 1997 were to improve the performance of its existing portfolio, continue to upgrade and rebalance the portfolio and invest the proceeds from the sale of its continental European properties as well as complete a reorganisation of its British arm.</p>
<p>MEPC's chairman Michael Blakenham said in a statement that his target for NAV was 690 pence per share in 2001. This he said was based on the assumption the firm could achieve an internal rate of return of 12.5 percent a year over the next five years and allowing for "the beneficial effects of gearing".</p>
<p>"A modest yield shift in favour of property would enhance the projected returns and I believe there is a good prospect of such a movement," Blakenham said, adding he also wanted to increase earnings sufficiently to allow the group to resume dividend growth. The total dividend was unchanged at 20 pence.</p>
<p>He said he wanted to maintain financial flexibility with a net gearing of around 65 percent and interest cover above 1.5 times. The most disappointing single event of the year had been a 31 million pound writedown on the Northridge Mall in Los Angeles, which he said was equivalent to 7.5 pence per share.</p>
