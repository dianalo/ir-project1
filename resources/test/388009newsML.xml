<p>Thai rubber prices edged down this week in line with lower Japan prices and due to thin demand, trade sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The buying was rather modest and the prices were also pressured by a slide in Japanese prices," said one Hat Yai-based trader.</p>
<p>"Japan and China entered the market but not much activity from Malaysia," he said.</p>
<p>The benchmark RSS3 for March delivery was quoted around 122-122.50 U.S. cents a kg FOB Bangkok, from 123.0 on Friday.</p>
<p>Concentrated latex was quoted around 93 U.S. cents a kg from 94 on Friday.</p>
