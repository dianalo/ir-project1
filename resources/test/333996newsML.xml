<p>A state-appointed oversight board Monday approved Miami's $275 million budget for fiscal 1997, reducing its demand for cash reserves to only $4 million.</p>
<p>The board had previously asked for up to $27.2 million in cash reserves. The plan approved today would also allow the city to count $9.6 million worth of property toward its reserves with the understanding that the property would be sold immediately in case of a budget shortfall.</p>
<p>The plan also uses $7 million worth of proceeds from city-owned property sales and a $3 million federal grant to police to replace the $10 million of revenue the board previously said was too questionable to count on.  </p>
<p>The city said its cash flow had improved so that it now does not expect to run out of money before the end of June. The city previously had expected to run out in March.</p>
<p>"We're well back on track," Mayor Joe Carrollo said after a meeting of the oversight board. The city must now present a five-year budget to the oversight board by April 15, and must report every 30 days on its cash flow status.</p>
<p>Oversight board chairman Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay said the new budget relies mostly on new revenues. "We never even talked about cutting costs. I'm hoping that by April 15 we'll start thinking about it," he said.</p>
<p>Gov. Lawton Chiles appointed the oversight board to guide Miami to fiscal solvency after the city discovered a $68 million deficit in the $275 million budget for the fiscal year that began Oct 1.</p>
