<p>Israel's leader Benjamin Netanyahu shrugged off criticism by U.S. President Bill Clinton on Tuesday, vowing to start work within days on a new Jewish neighbourhood in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>"It's two weeks from the standpoint of the bulldozers. From the standpoint of the survey work it's only a few days," the Israeli prime minister told army radio. "We are determined to go on building in Jerusalem."</p>
<p>Clinton sided with Israel's Palestinian peace partner Yasser Arafat at the White House on Monday, saying Netanyahu's plan to build 6,500 homes for Jews on land that is supposed to be subject to future negotiations would fuel "mistrust".</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem in the 1967 Middle East war and annexed it, a move not recognised internationally, to claim all the city as its capital.</p>
<p>Palestinians, who are supposed to negotiate the future of the city with Israel, see Israel's building as an attempt to block their demand that East Jerusalem be the capital of their future state.</p>
<p>"There was nothing new in what he (Clinton) said," Netanyahu told the radio. "The Americans understand our policy well."</p>
<p>He said Clinton also made clear to Arafat the United States would not tolerate violence. On Monday, Palestinians shut down East Jerusalem, the rest of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip in a general protest strike that passed without incident.</p>
<p>Netanyahu has faced a drumbeat of criticism from the United States, Europe and the Arab world that could reach a crescendo on Tuesday at a U.N. Security Council debate aimed at halting the building project.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, in Jerusalem on Tuesday, was to discuss Middle East peace moves with Netanyahu and Israel's Foreign Minister David Levy.</p>
<p>"It could be the world doesn't agree to our sovereignty in Jerusalem. But we are united in agreeing that we are the sovereigns in Jerusalem," said a defiant Netanyahu. "I don't intend to be influenced by opposition of one kind or another."</p>
<p>He denied delaying work until after he visits Egypt on Wednesday, citing unspecified legal and "technical" reasons. Egyptian leader Hosni Mubarak has already said the project will loom large in the talks with Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said he would convene a cabinet meeting this week to discuss carrying out the next withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of the West Bank as agreed with the PLO in January. The redeployment is due to take place by Friday.</p>
<p>"I imagine we will begin carrying it out immediately after a decision will be taken," Netanyahu told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>In a bid to blunt criticism of the building project, Israel said it would allow another 3,000 homes for Arabs in East Jerusalem. Peace activists dismissed the announcement as a public relations ploy unlikely to be carried out.</p>
<p>Israeli moves in Jerusalem sparked violence in September. Sixty-one Arabs and 15 Israeli soldiers died in gunbattles after Netanyahu opened a tourist tunnel entrance near Islamic shrines.</p>
