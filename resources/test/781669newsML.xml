<p>The Australian federal government announced on Wednesday a major revamp of the A$5 billion (US$3.7 billion) system of state sales taxes and signalled a major push for a complete reform of the nation's indirect tax system.</p>
<p>Treasurer Peter Costello said Canberra would replace at midnight (1400 GMT) on Wednesday taxes on petrol, alcohol and tobacco levied by state governments with a new regime of uniform national taxes.</p>
<p>The revamp was forced by a High Court decision released on Tuesday that the state taxes, known as franchise fees, were unconstitutional because they were in reality excise duties which can only be levied by the federal government.</p>
<p>Costello told a reporters in Sydney the six state and two territory governments had asked the federal government to levy the taxes on their behalf and hand the revenues back to them.</p>
<p>"The Commonwealth (federal government) will agree to that request and the Commonwealth will return all of the revenues that are collected to the states," Costello said.</p>
<p>Costello said he had only agreed to the new system after the states had assured him it would be set up and run in a way that did not raise tax revenues or prices.</p>
<p>"No additional revenue is being taken," he said.</p>
<p>But, he said, the states would have to negotiate with tobacco and brewing companies to rectify the effects of uniform tax rates to keep prices stable.</p>
<p>Currently the states have a patchwork of differing taxes for different products and some products are not taxed at all in some states. The new uniform system meant some states would receive higher revenues.</p>
<p>But the states had agreed to return this extra money to wholesalers so prices and revenues did not rise, Costello said.</p>
<p>Costello later detailed in a statement the exact tax rates to apply in the new regime.</p>
<p>The current customs and excise duty on petrol would increase by 8.1 cents a litre and on tobacco by A$167 a kg. The wholesale tax on alcohol will increase by 15 percentage points, he said.</p>
<p>Costello also foreshadowed legislation to stop people trying to claim previous state sales taxes back on the grounds they had been collected unconstitutionally.</p>
<p>Any money reclaimed from the states would be retrieved by the federal government as income tax at a rate of 100 percent to act as a deterrent, he said.</p>
<p>Costello also signalled a renewed push for reform of an ageing, creaking national tax system.</p>
<p>"I don't regard this as a permenant solution to the complexities of the Australian taxation system," he said.</p>
<p>"We want to reform the indirect tax base. I think more and more people are coming to the view that this is necessary."</p>
<p>"It will last to the end of the decade, but I wouldn't give the current system a long life expectancy in the next century."</p>
<p>Costello's latest call for reform is another step in the ruling conservative coalition's slow reversal of its opposition to a Goods and Services Tax (GST).</p>
<p>The Liberal/National coalition lost the 1993 election after it proposed a Goods and Services Tax (GST) and then dropped the GST as a policy and repeatedly said in the 1996 election it would not introduce one in its first term.</p>
<p>Since then however, Prime Minister John Howard and Costello have said the indirect tax system needs reform and they are widely expected to propose some form of GST before the next election expected by mid-1999.</p>
