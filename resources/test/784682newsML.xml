<p>The Croatian stock market looks set for further growth in the next few months after an astounding bull-run during the normally quiet summer weeks, analysts and traders said.</p>
<p>The trend will be boosted by a rash of new issues expected on the exchange in the autumn and will be led by Pliva pharmaceuticals and Zagrebacka Banka, both of which broke through all-time highs last month.</p>
<p>"I think the focus once again will be on new issues, and that will remind people that Croatia still exists. So we could see some further growth," said James Oates of Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS) in London.</p>
<p>He said there had been a very solid performance over the last few months and the important test would come when people arrived back from the summer break, traditionally taken in Croatia during August.</p>
<p>He also said he expected Croatia to outperform most other emerging markets this year. "There is a sense of unease about some of the rest of Central Europe and the result has been that people are focusing on Croatia particularly."</p>
<p>The blue chips which dictate developments on Zagreb's small stock exchange powered ahead throughout July and are still doing sound business, despite the traditional August lull. There is no market index to exactly measure the rises.</p>
<p>Both Pliva and Zagrebacka closed at all-time highs on Wednesday, following a rise of their London-traded Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs).</p>
<p>Pliva's 1/5 GDRs added 10 cents to $17.60 on Wednesday while Zagrebacka's fetched $38.125, breaking previous records. They represent 1/10 of each underlying share. In Zagreb their shares closed at 584 and 2,500 kuna respectively.</p>
<p>Both stocks were expected to continue driving the market upwards for some time. With the London prices firming, partly due to a rise in the dollar, and rumours about both companies' solid profit growth in the first half of the year, short-term prospects seem quite glossy, market sources say.</p>
<p>One trader said Pliva could benefit from a steady dollar rise even more than Zagrebacka, and added that the company was bound to make more money from a license agreement with U.S. pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc as the deal was in dollars.</p>
<p>Danijel Nevidal of Austria's CAIB, Credianstalt Investment Bank unit in Croatia, said the current bull run had continued to surprise market participants, who believed the activity would wind down in July.</p>
<p>It was brought on by the Zagreb bourse's decision some three weeks ago to renounce its commission for a month so as to spur trade during the holiday season.</p>
<p>The bourse's move attracted more interest from foreign investors, who are the biggest players on the Croatian market. As a result trade has flourished, boosting daily turnover to a high of 25.5 million kuna in July.</p>
<p>Some market participants foresaw a slight contraction across the board if buying subsides due to the summer break, but they don't expect this to be long-term.</p>
<p>"The majority of brokers are now on holiday. A lazier period may last at least until August 15," said Ratko Bajakic, director of the Investmentbank Austria's Croatian subsidiary.</p>
<p>However he too thought the lull would not be too protracted, with a steady growth cycle of the past few months likely to resume in the autumn.</p>
<p>It is expected to begin as early as September, when quoted companies -- Pliva, Zagrebacka, Varazdinska Banka and shipyard Viktor Lenac -- are due to release their first-half figures.</p>
