<p>European oil swaps fell on Thursday morning as expectations of an early resumption of Iraqi oil exports pressured futures prices.</p>
<p>Gasoline led the move lower, falling $7 a tonne to trade at $213 for August compared to levels around $220 on Wednesday. September dropped nearer $4.50 a tonne to $197 as the recently steep backwardation softened slightly.</p>
<p>Dealers said some of the downward pressure was due to falling Brent which lost 25 cents a barrel, although CFD swaps were little changed.</p>
<p>Next week's CFDs traded at 30 cents under October, unchanged from Wednesday. The following two weeks held at 30 cents under and 27 cents under respectively.</p>
<p>Naphtha slipped $2 a tonne to talk $193.50 for August and $198.50 for September. Dealers said the Asian market had slipped into contango undermining support for European prices and upping the chances of further losses over the next few days.</p>
<p>Gas oil swaps were steady with September EN590 bid at $6 a tonne above the IPE, October at $7 and November at $8.</p>
<p>Gas oil crack spreads against Brent were holding around $4.60 a barrel for both the fourth and first quarter.</p>
<p>Heavy fuel swaps eased $1 a tonne to talk $94 for August with September and October at $95 and $96 respectively.</p>
<p>Low sulphur held at $1 above barges for August, $3 over for September and $4.50 over in the fourth quarter.</p>
