<p>Hurricane Isidore became the fifth major hurricane of the Atlantic season Friday, with its winds reaching 115 mph (185 kph) as it moved across the ocean far from land, the National Hurricane Centre said.</p>
<p>At 5 p.m. (2100 GMT), the centre of Isidore was about 1,180 miles (1,900 km) west of Africa's Cape Verde islands at latitude 15.3 north and longitude 42.5 west.</p>
<p>The storm's maximum sustained winds had risen to near 115 mph (185 kph), making Isidore a major Category 3 hurricane. Forecasters said they expected some fluctuations in intensity over the next 24 hours, but said Isidore was expected to turn gradually north, a track that would keep it far from land.</p>
<p>Isidore was moving northwest near 15 mph (24 kph), with the gradually northward turn expected on Saturday, forecasters said.</p>
