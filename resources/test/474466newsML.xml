<p>Indian base metals remained steady in a narrow price band on the local market with low demand from industrial consumers offset by limited arrivals of imported metals which kept prices around previous levels.</p>
<p>Copper was steady at 13,500 rupees per quintal, as was zinc at 7750 rupees and lead at 4,550 rupees in limited activity.</p>
<p>Trading volumes were at low ebb as major players kept to the sidelines, busy with their books of account ahead of the end of fiscal year, which in India concludes on March 31.</p>
<p>Nickel was steady at the reduced level of 37,000 rupees per quintal after losing 100 rupees on Thursday while tin was quiet at 31,600 rupees, as was aluminium at 7,425 rupees.</p>
<p>"Narrow fluctuations and poor activity in world markets due to Good Friday and the upcoming Easter holidays also kept local markets quiet," said Sharad Parikh, president of Bombay Metal Exchange.</p>
