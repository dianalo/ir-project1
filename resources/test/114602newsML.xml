<p>The first half of 1996 saw a 16 percent rise to 59.5 billion marks in the amount invested in German equity-backed investment funds, Deutsche Bank AG's investment wing, DWS, said in a report.</p>
<p>"Capital investments within the private pension provision framework are set to become an increasingly important factor in the funds market," DWS said in a statement.</p>
<p>Overall, total capital investment in German investment funds, including Luxembourg, increased by four percent in the first half of 1996 to 347.3 billion marks, the DWS report said.</p>
<p>"Particularly interesting to investors were equity-backed funds with capital guarantees," the report said.</p>
<p>Levels of investment in bond-backed products actually fell in the six-month period.</p>
<p>The report said that market expectations of volatile returns in long-term investments fuelled the 1.9 percent decline in the amount invested in bond-backed funds to 111 billion marks.</p>
<p>Money market funds, legalised in the autumn of 1994, saw a decline of 3.2 percent in the half-year. Mixed funds, especially those with tax optimisation aspects, grew by 2.1 percent in the period.</p>
