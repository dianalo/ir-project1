<p>Syrian workers on construction sites in Beirut said on Tuesday they had not received orders to return home for mobilisation into the army.</p>
<p>Transport companies and Lebanese foremen at projects employing hundreds of Syrians also told Reuters they had no indication of exceptional movements among Syrian workers, who are estimated to total up to one million in Lebanon by some sources.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on a frontpage report in a Beirut newspaper that Syrian authorities had ordered an estimated 100,000 workers home from Lebanon for mobilisation, a Syrian construction worker told Reuters: "That's just newspaper talk."</p>
<p>"But it's quite normal that they call up a few of us every now and then for reserve service. Sometimes people go for 45 days and then they come back," he added.</p>
<p>The story in the conservative Beirut daily an-Nahar was based on a report by the Saudi-owned broadcasting company Middle East Broadcasting Corporation (MEBC) saying Syria had recalled 100,000 workers from Lebanon for army duty.</p>
<p>Lebanese security sources said they had heard reports in the past two days that some Syrian workers were being recalled by Damascus. However, they had no details.</p>
<p>Employees of two bus companies in Beirut transporting Syrian workers between Lebanon and Syria told Reuters there had been no recent increase in the number of Syrians going home.</p>
<p>"Every weekend, about 10 busloads go to Syria. Last Saturday we took about 500 workers and brought back almost the same number. This is very normal," said an employee at Karanak, the main bus company transporting Syrians between Syria and Lebanon.</p>
<p>An employee at Al-Ittihad Travel, which links Beirut and major Syrian cities by bus, said the number of passengers to Syria this week was almost unchanged from the previous weeks.</p>
<p>At a highway construction project at the southern entrance to Beirut, a Lebanese foreman told Reuters none of the 220 Syrian workers employed on the site was absent.</p>
