<p>The European Union's monetary committee of central bank and finance ministry officials on Tuesday agreed an outline for punishing countries which run excessive deficits under a single currency, EU sources said.</p>
<p>Several important details of a budget stability pact remained unresolved, but there was a common understanding that governments which failed to present a credible plan for curbing excess deficits should be penalised automatically, they said.</p>
<p>The agreement came after the committee, which seeks to agree EU policy before presenting it to finance ministers, spent two days discussing new currency arrangements to follow the third stage of economic and monetary union (EMU), the single EU currency.</p>
<p>"We made progress on the issue of automatic sanctions," one monetary source said. "It is now up to the ministers to decide." EU finance ministers and central bank governors are to meet in informal talks in Dublin on September 20 and 21.</p>
<p>Under the scenario envisaged by the committee, a country that ran a budget deficit in excess of 3 percent of Gross Domestic Product would have to present a plan to its partners for fixing the problem.</p>
<p>If the plan was deemed insufficient, automatic sanctions would kick in.</p>
