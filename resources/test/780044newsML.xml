<p>German shares shrugged off early losses on Wall Street and remained slightly bouyant in post-bourse IBIS computer dealings.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX, which reflects all-day computer trading, was up 17.10 marks at 4,319.60 points and above the DAX closing level at the end of bourse trade at 4,302.68 points.</p>
<p>The dollar seeking to reach 1.88 marks in late European dealings was a prime factor for the advance as export-driven shares found renewed strength. Banking sector shares were mixed as speculation about possible mergers also remained at the market forefront.  </p>
<p>The market downplayed comments from Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing, who said in a magazine interview released on Tuesday that foreign exchange rates were an important indicator for the German central bank.</p>
<p>Traders instead focused on the Bundesbank earlier on Tuesday deciding to leave monetary policy on hold by keeping the securities repurchase rate fixed at three percent.</p>
<p>Dealers had speculated the central bank might opt to switch to a variable-rate repo, which allows banks to bid for funds and would have likely caused the repo rate to rise, to help curb the dramatic rise in the dollar against the mark.  </p>
<p>Among the top gainers in post-bourse computer dealings were industrial group Daimler-Benz AG, which rose 2.35 marks to 148.90 marks and sportswear group Adidas AG, which rose 1.90 marks to 216.90 marks ahead of its six-month results due on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Banking shares were mixed as Deutsche Bank AG slipped 50 pfennigs to 117.50 marks and Dresdner Bank AG fell 1.92 marks to 78.78 marks.</p>
<p>But Commerzbank AG, considered a prime takeover or merger target, was up 1.09 marks at 62.40 marks.</p>
