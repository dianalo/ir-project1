<p>Singapore shares are likely to slip on Friday following an overnight fall on Wall Street and some bearish technical pointers, dealers said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Straits Times Industrials share Index ended 2.81 points higher at 2,067.17 on Thursday after trading in a narrow 30-point range in very thin volume all week.</p>
<p>Dealers said institutional buying interest was continuing but added that this tended to be focused on a few blue chip stocks.</p>
<p>Technical analysts said the Singapore stock market could drop in the short term to a low a little above 2,000 points.  </p>
<p>New York's Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 27.05 points overnight to 7,330.18.</p>
