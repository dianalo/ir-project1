<p>Reacting to a runway crash at Quincy, Illinois, air traffic controllers Thursday called for a review of non-controlled airports that handle scheduled commercial flights.</p>
<p>The National Air Traffic Controllers Association said the crash spotlighted the condition of uncontrolled flying at many smaller airports across the nation that should be investigated by the Federal Aviation Administration.</p>
<p>In the Tuesday accident, 14 people were killed when a 19-seat United Express turboprop Beech 1900 that was landing collided with the smaller twin-prop Beech King Air 200.</p>
<p>The airport, like many in smaller cities, has no air traffic control tower and pilots using it are to keep in contact with other planes by sight and radio.</p>
<p>Controller president Barry Krasner said that many small uncontrolled airports were designed to serve recreational pilots who flew on weekends and holidays but are increasingly being used by commuter planes.</p>
<p>"We can learn the lesson of Quincy," Krasner said. "It's time to take stock and see what we have out there."</p>
<p>He said his union's position was that the FAA was de-emphasising safety. "The FAA is contracting out vital air traffic control functions at the nation's smaller airports -- diminishing our link to aviation safety."</p>
<p>Krasner said he opposed this and believed that airports not controlled but serving scheduled flights should be given the same level of air control service as Chicago's O'Hare and New York's LaGuardia airports.</p>
