<p>India's troubled Kashmir region has taken a step towards an elusive peace with the first local elections since a separatist revolt erupted in 1990, analysts and diplomats said on Sunday.</p>
<p>But the return of normalcy to the Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir after almost seven years of insurgency ultimately will require India and Pakistan to put aside decades of bitter differences, they said.</p>
<p>Voters in Jammu and Kashmir cast ballots on Saturday on the first day of four-stage assembly polls. More voting is set for September 16, 21 and 30.</p>
<p>They are the first local polls since 1987. The assembly which emerged from those elections was dissolved in 1990 when the federal government clamped the state under direct rule in an effort to quell the insurgency.</p>
<p>Dozens of militant groups are fighting for independence or merger with Pakistan, which rules one-third of Kashmir, called Azad (Free) Kashmir, and has staked a claim over the rest.</p>
<p>Indian authorities said they were highly satisfied with Saturday's polling. Voter turnout of 50 to 53 percent was higher than 49 percent in general elections held in May.</p>
<p>At least four people were killed in scattered violence on Saturday. But the figure was less that the average daily death toll since 1990, and there was no violence at polling stations.</p>
<p>Polling was marred partly by claims that security officers had compelled some voters to participate.</p>
<p>Authorities denied the allegations.</p>
<p>Pran Chopra, an analyst with the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi, said coercion was regrettable but largely offset by the efforts of militants to prevent citizens voting.</p>
<p>"For all the election's flaws, this is a very good step forward," Chopra said.</p>
<p>"But elections are only the beginning. There are several more stages to go before India and Pakistan resolve their problems," he added.</p>
<p>Nearly 50 years after India and Pakistan gained independence from Britain, Kashmir remains the single biggest obstacle to closer ties between Islamabad and New Delhi.</p>
<p>A flare-up of cross-border firing between Indian and Pakistani troops on Saturday's polls was a reminder that the area remains a threat to regional peace.</p>
<p>"It was a war-like situation," a Pakistan army official told Reuters in Muzaffarabad, near the military control line.</p>
<p>Diplomats said there was no immediate threat that India and Pakistan would fight their fourth war since 1947.</p>
<p>But they said any long-term solution to Kashmir would probably require New Delhi and Islamabad to give up competing claims over territory controlled for decades by the rival side.</p>
<p>Farooq Abdullah, chairman of the regional National Conference party and tipped to become the state's next chief minister when poll results are announced in October, agrees.</p>
<p>"Pakistan and India have to talk. When the elections are over, I hope the prime minister of Pakistan and the prime minister of India will try to work out the problems," he told reporters last week.</p>
<p>"We cannot become part of Pakistan. We cannot become independent because we have very strong neighbours. We cannot defend ourselves against Pakistan and China.</p>
<p>"If we were independent, in hardly a few minutes they would walk into our land," he added, saying the line of control should become the border.</p>
<p>Diplomats and analysts say prospects for talks might be helped by an apparent slackening of militancy.</p>
<p>"It is very clear that militancy has shifted from a manifestation of genuine unhappiness on the part of Kashmiris to being largely sustained by foreign support," one diplomat said.</p>
<p>"They are having trouble recruiting Kashmiri youth. I think the Kashmiris are sick of it," the diplomat added.</p>
<p>Chopra said the challenge now lay in meeting Abdullah's demand for more autonomy for Jammu and Kashmir, and easing curbs on movement across the line of control.</p>
