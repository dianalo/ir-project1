<p>Leaflets urging the population of Zaire's capital Kinshasa to stay at home and display white flags to welcome Laurent Kabila's rebels have begun circulating in the teeming city, residents say.</p>
<p>The leaflets, purporting to come from Kabila's Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo-Zaire, urged the capital's residents to stage a "stay-at-home" protest from Wednesday to Friday, the residents added.</p>
<p>"The pro-Kabila armed forces are already there. They are going to liberate the heart of Congo very soon," one leaflet said. "Dear population, in order to avoid a bloodbath observe a 'stay-at-home' from Wednesday May 14 to Friday May 16."</p>
<p>The leaflets were photocopies of a typewritten sheet.</p>
<p>When the battle came, residents should stay home to avoid being hit by stray bullets or being considered looters, one said.</p>
<p>The armed forces, it added, should remain in their camps to be given a role by the rebel alliance and fly white flags as a sign of peace. Uniformed soldiers in the streets would be considered as opponents of the alliance.</p>
<p>It urged residents to avoid the city centre and the edges of the city and sing songs of joy as a sign of peace. They should also fly white flags from their homes, it said.</p>
<p>Embattled President Mobutu Sese Seko is due to meet rebel leader Laurent Kabila on Wednesday on a South African ship.</p>
<p>South Africa's deputy president, Thabo Mbeki, who is trying to avert a bloody battle for Kinshasa, said that Wednesday's meeting could be the last hope for a peaceful settlement.</p>
