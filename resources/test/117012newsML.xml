<p>Unemployment in Hong Kong, which hit a 10 year peak last year, shrank in the third quarter of 1996 and economists said they expect to see it ease further.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's Census and Statistics Department said the unemployment rate for July to September slipped to 2.6 percent from 2.8 percent in the June-to-August period.</p>
<p>Unemployment in Hong Kong -- where a labour shortage had until recently permitted workers to job hop at will -- hit a 10-year high of 3.6 percent in the August-October 1995 period.</p>
<p>Economists said they expect the trend to persist and estimated unemployment would hover around 2.3 to 2.5 percent by year end.</p>
<p>This would compare with 3.5 percent in the last quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>"I think the improvement was better than expected," said K.K. Chan, chief economist, at Nomura Research Institute.</p>
<p>"It will continue to fall, because Hong Kong's economy is bottoming out," he said.</p>
<p>Connie Leung, head of the Asian Research Group at HSBC Asset Management, said signs of an economic pick-up suggested the jobless rate would continue to ease.</p>
<p>"The economy has improved. The property market and consumption power have started to pick up a little," she said.</p>
