<p>A British minister advised the Czech Republic on Monday to reject a key part of the Maastricht Treaty when it negotiates membership of the European Union.</p>
<p>Speaking in Prague, junior Foreign Office Minister David Davis attacked the treaty's Social Chapter guaranteeing minimum EU working standards which Britain refused to accept when it signed the Maastricht Treaty on European integration in 1992.</p>
<p>Listing restrictive labour practices around EU countries, he said: "They are precisely the sort of legislation which might be attempted under the Social Chapter.</p>
<p>"So my advice to the Czech Republic is, when you join the European Union, this is the one part you should decline."</p>
<p>The Czech Republic applied to join the EU early this year and is tipped to be in the first wave of former East Bloc countries to join the union.</p>
<p>Davis told a conference organised by the Czech business-backed Bohemiae Foundation that the Social Chapter was not part of the "acquis communautaire", a mass of EU regulations which any new member has to accept.</p>
<p>"You may be told that it is part of the acquis communautaire and that you have no choice," he said. "In our view that is wrong. The Social Chapter is a side-deal outside the acquis."</p>
<p>Britain is the only country to have won an opt-out from the Social Chapter, arguing that labour market restrictions hinder efforts to create jobs and make Europe more competitive.</p>
<p>However, the opposition Labour Party, which is well ahead of the ruling Conservatives in opinion polls, says that it will sign up if it wins elections due by next spring.</p>
<p>Brussels has said the British opt-out was a one-off, although conservative Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus is also sceptical about the chapter.</p>
