<p>The combined assets of Taiwan's 65 offshore banking units grew 9.0 percent to a new high of US$36.59 billion at the end of December from a year earlier, the central bank said on Monday.</p>
<p>About 77 percent of the assets, held by 36 local banks and 29 foreign banks, came from Asia and the rest from Europe and America, the bank said in a statement.</p>
<p>The statement added that the bank had recently approved four more offshore banking unit applications by foreign banks and one more by a local bank.</p>
<p>In December, Taiwan's offshore banking units reported a monthly foreign exchange turnover of $3.742 billion, the statement said.</p>
<p>Of the derivatives operated by theese units, margin trading accounted for $403 million, options $282 million, financial futures accounted for $72 million, interest rate swaps took $51 million and forward interest rate agreements took $5 million.</p>
<p>The government has planned to expand the offshore banking unit business as part of its scheme to become a regional financial centre. This expansion would herald some tax burden for these units, although its size is still unspecified, officials have said.</p>
