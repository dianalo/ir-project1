<p>Hungary's forint closed firmer against the dollar on Wednesday, after tracking the movements of the dollar/mark cross all day, dealers said.</p>
<p>The forint finished at 179.79/84, compared with 179.87/93 at the opening and 179.68/70 at midday.</p>
<p>"(The forint) firmed due to the change in the dollar/mark," said Adam Szilagyi of Altalanos Ertekforgalmi Bank, adding that the market was dominated by speculation on the movements of the dollar/mark on the international markets.</p>
<p>The forint floats against a currency basket, made up 30 percent of the dollar and 70 percent of the mark, within the National Bank of Hungary's (NBH) 4.5 percent wide floating intervention range.</p>
<p>The forint remained pinned to the NBH's resistance level (bid) on Wednesday, and dealers said they did not see factors on the domestic stage easing the forint versus the NBH bid.</p>
<p>They said the forint was made attractive by relatively high domestic interest rates, supported by the NBH's recent 0.25 hike in the interest rate of its six-month deposit facility, a move aimed at protecting savings.</p>
<p>The NBH fixed the forint at 179.74 to one dollar on Wednesday, compared with 179.53 on Tuesday.</p>
