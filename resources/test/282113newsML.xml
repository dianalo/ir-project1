<p>Iraqi and Jordanian ministers are holding talks in Baghdad that are expected to lead to an agreement on slightly increased oil supplies, according to official reports.</p>
<p>The Iraqi News Agency INA said on Tuesday that Oil Minister Amir Muhammed Rasheed headed the Iraqi side while Jordan was represented by Energy and Mineral Resources Mininster Hashem Dabbas.</p>
<p>Dabbas, heading a high-ranking Jordanian delegation that includes Finance and Customs Minister Marwan Awad, said on Monday Jordan would buy 4.5 million tonnes of crude oil and refined products from Iraq in 1997.</p>
<p>This compares with 4.4 million tonnes in 1996.</p>
<p>"President Saddam Hussein has given his directives to meet all Jordan's needs of oil and its by-products," INA quoted Rasheed as telling the Jordanian officials.</p>
<p>Jordan, which is exempt from the U.N. trade sanctions that bar Iraq from freely exporting its oil following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, currently imports 75,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil from Iraq.</p>
<p>Jordanians also have their eyes set on an oil-for-food deal signed by Iraq and the United Nations. The deal, put into effect on December 10, allows Baghdad to sell $2 billion worth of oil every six months to buy food and medicine for Iraqis.</p>
<p>"Jordanian trade and industrial companies have signed contracts with Iraq worth $120 million dollars to supply it with foodstuffs, medicine and other goods under the deal signed by Iraq and the U.N.," Dabbas said, quoted by INA.</p>
<p>Baghdad has agreed to sell Amman $80 million worth of oil under the oil-for-food deal.</p>
<p>Jordan has been totally dependent on Iraq for its oil supplies since Saudi Arabia stopped the flow of an estimated 40,000 bpd of crude to punish it for its pro-Iraqi standpoint during the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>The 75,000 bpd Iraqi crude to Jordan is trucked by road. Amman pays market prices for 25,000 bpd and for another 25,000 bpd of products. The rest is at undisclosed concessionary terms.</p>
