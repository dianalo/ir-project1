<headline>Asian crude - Heavy crudes fall further.</headline>
<dateline>SINGAPORE 1997-08-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>Asia's heavy sweet crudes weakened on thin Japanese demand, traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>But trading remained focused on the Middle East crudes, which were supported by news of lower official prices.</p>
<p>Parcels of September Oman traded to majors on Friday around MPM -3/4 cents per barrel.</p>
<p>This was before the release of the July Oman official MPM price, which saw a narrowing of Oman's premium over Dubai to 11 cents, from 47 cents in June.  </p>
<p>Although traders were confident of a narrower premium, they expected it to be around 25 cents, and were pleasantly surprised.</p>
<p>This should keep Oman levels supported, but September Oman trading is almost finished, with only a western trader, a Chinese trader and a European major heard holding cargoes.</p>
<p>Around four cargoes of Abu Dhabi crudes are still on offer for September, with sellers looking at ADNOC +10 cents for Murban and ADNOC +15 for Lower Zakum.</p>
<p>A European major sold 650,000 barrels of Murban at ADNOC +80/90 c+f to Kenya, traders said.  </p>
<p>But ample supplies of September Masila were still available, with sellers heard offering OSP -25 cents, facing potential buyers at OSP -50.</p>
<p>In the Asian crude market, a western trader confirmed looking to sell a September cargo of Tapis, but was not showing any firm offer yet.</p>
<p>August heavy sweet Widuri was heard sold around ICP +20/25 by a shosha, a fall from early August trades at ICP +40.</p>
<p>Discussion for August Minas was also sharply lower at ICP +25, compared to the last trade heard done around ICP +40, and early August deals at +75.  </p>
