<p>Canadian T-bills opened weaker on Friday, softening with U.S. fixed-income markets, which traded lower on the release of key jobs data for May, traders said.</p>
<p>"We're moving in sympathy with the U.S., which is a direct result of the numbers that came out this morning," said Walter Posiewko, a money market trader with Royal Bank Investment Management Inc. "These numbers are suggesting increased odds for a Fed tightening in early July."</p>
<p>Canada's three-month when-issued T-bill softened to yield 3.0 percent from 2.97 percent at Thursday's close.  </p>
<p>Canadian and U.S. fixed-income markets weakened after the U.S. Labor Department reported that 138,000 jobs were created in May and that the unemployment rate fell to 4.8 percent.</p>
<p>While the number of new jobs was lower than expected, upward revisions to the jobs data for the previous two months worried many investors, as did the drop in the unemployment rate. The data increased concerns that the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates when its Open Market Committee meets in May.  </p>
<p>Dealers said there was good two-way flow in the Canadian market and the U.S. data did not prompt panic selling.</p>
<p>In other prices, the six-month when-issued T-bill softened to yield of 3.36 percent from 3.32 percent. The one-year T-bill softened to yield 3.85 percent from 3.82 percent.</p>
<p>The call loan or overnight lending rate traded at 2.90 percent, in the lower half of the Bank of Canada's 2.75-3.25 percent target range.</p>
