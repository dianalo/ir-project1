<p>The Latvian central depository said on Wednesday that pressure from Lithuanian brokers on their central depository was preventing a pan-Baltic equities market from being formed.</p>
<p>Latvia and Estonia signed a co-operation agreement earlier this year allowing investors to keep the other countries' shares in an account in their home country and carry out settlements in their home country as well.</p>
<p>Latvia and Estonia want to sign a similar agreement with Lithuania.</p>
<p>"The Lithuanian depository is holding back from joining (the two other Baltic states' agreement) following recommendations from their financial intermediaries," Martinsh Rikshe, president of the depositary, told a news conference.</p>
<p>"They are afraid of losing profit if Estonian or Latvian players enter the market," Rikshe added.</p>
<p>"The Lithuanian depository supports such a step in principle but is not ready because of the pressure from market members," Rikshe said.</p>
<p>This was preventing the creation of an infrastructure for a common Baltic equities market, he added.</p>
<p>"Many foreign institutions, which expressed their satisfaction about the Estonian and Latvian agreement, are now puzzled about the situation with Lithuania," Rikshe said.</p>
<p>Many foreign investors view the Baltic as a single unit and would like to have use one of the national bourses as gateway to the rest of the region's financial markets.</p>
