<title>NETHERLANDS: Dutch closing share market report.</title>

<p>Dutch shares ended slightly lower on Tuesday despite the market rallying early behind news that financial giant ING Groep had agreed its biggest ever purchase, a $2.2. billion buy of U.S. insurer Equitable Iowa.</p>
<p>The news dominated the day's activities, helping to turn the market around from a weaker start, but in the end profit-taking elsewhere in the index weighed on the overall trend.</p>
<p>But not before the AEX index had surged to a new intra-day record at 926.12 points, before slipping back. It finally closed at 918.04 points, 0.81 down on Monday's record close.</p>
<p>The AMX mid-cap index finished 4.17 points up at 1,381.87.  </p>
<p>An ING purchase in the U.S. life insurance sector had been widely expected by the Dutch market, but the news still caused the shares to jump, pushing them up sharply to a close at 101.90 guilders, up 6.30 or 6.6 percent.</p>
<p>The ING deal, the biggest in ING's history, will positively impact ING's earnings in the first year and roughly double its U.S. life insurance premium income to $4.3 billion, ING said.</p>
<p>The Dutch banking group described the deal as a perfect fit with its U.S. life insurance operations, which up until now were concentrated in the higher and lower segments of the market, whilst Equitable of Iowa was strong in the middle segment.  </p>
<p>ING had long been rumoured to be on the look out for a U.S. purchase and is estimated to have a war chest of between eight and 10 billion guilders for acquisitions. It will finance the offer through a mixture of ING shares and cash.</p>
<p>"It's very good strategic deal for ING. Their activites in the U.S. before this were a little weak and this gives them the clout that's needed," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the market was relatively quiet, with ABN AMRO one of the few other stocks to end with any gains.</p>
<p>Most others succumbed to hefty profit-taking, brought on by the market's recent relentless rise to fresh record finishes.  </p>
<p>Royal Dutch and Philips were among the index heavyweights that lost ground, the oil giant down 4.10 guilders to 109.90 and the electronics group slipping 2.40 to 143.30.</p>
<p>"We saw some selling in these stocks based on their parity in the United States but considering what the market has done in the past few weeks, it's wasn't surprising," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The AEX has gained almost 42 percent this year and put on 6.65 percent since the beginning of last week alone. Analysts now believe a larger correction would be healthy, pinning near-term chart support at around 911 points.</p>
