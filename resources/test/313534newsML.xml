<p>Australia discovered its labour market was stronger than thought on Thursday when the official statistician said a new survey technique had been depressing estimates of jobs growth.</p>
<p>"The defining characteristic of this downturn has been weakness in the labour market, and now we find it was overstated," said Access Economics analyst Chris Richardson.</p>
<p>The changeover has helped make the jobs market look very flat, but economists say it is now more likely to have a little strength.  </p>
<p>The distortion stems from the Australian Bureau of Statistics phasing in telephone interviews for its jobs survey.</p>
<p>Each month since August the bureau has replaced one of its eight panels of 8,000 respondents with a new group interviewed by telephone, and each monthly changeover has pushed down the jobs estimate by 6,000 to 9,000.</p>
<p>With Thursday's December data, five of the eight panels had shifted to telephone interviewing and the bureau said the changeover had depressed its workforce by 30,000 to 45,000.</p>
<p>These lower employment estimates must be reflected in higher unemployment, lower workforce participation or both.  </p>
<p>A bureau spokesman said early months of the changeover had found a higher unemployment rate -- as sources told Reuters last month -- but that effect had faded and the employment change was now more likely to show up in participation.</p>
<p>"Our analysis will probably show no statistically significant effect on the unemployment rate," a spokesman said.</p>
<p>"There is evidence emerging that the lower employment will be reflected in a compensating effect on the number of persons in the labour force and consequently on participation."</p>
<p>The issue is not the accuracy of employment levels, since no one knows whether the new method is more or less accurate.  </p>
<p>But because they produce different results, changing the methods temporarily changes the reported rates of growth.</p>
<p>Whereas economists and policymakers pay little attention to levels, the rates of change -- how quickly the figures are going up or down -- are crucial influences on economic policy.</p>
<p>The employment estimates as published show just 68,000 new jobs since June -- not enough to meet government forecasts. Adjusting for the changed methodology, employment growth would be 98,000 to 113,000, consistent with Canberra's targets.  </p>
<p>"We can now be far more confident that the labour market is, at the least, not deteriorating," Bankers Trust chief economist Chris Caton said in an analysis.</p>
<p>The case for a further interest rates cut, which would be the fourth since the Reserve Bank began easing in July, was now weaker than it had been before Thursday's figures, Caton said.</p>
<p>The bureau estimated the effect of telephone interviewing by comparing its results with those from the old face-to-face interviews during the phase-in period.  </p>
<p>In two more months (January and February) the phase-in will be over, the survey having reached the final configuration of seven telephone interview panels plus one done face-to-face to introduce each new set of respondents.</p>
<p>If the results to date persist until the end of the changeover, then the new method will have a final effect of depressing the jobs estimate by 42,000 to 63,000.</p>
<p>The spokesman expected a final estimate of the effect would be somewhere between those two levels.  </p>
<p>The bureau would eventually publish that estimate along with the corresponding effects on the unemployment rate and participation, he said.</p>
<p>But even then the bureau will be left with the problem of how to present the changeover effect in its data.</p>
<p>The spokesman said the solution would probably be to adjust all of the old face-to-face data to conform with the new method.</p>
<p>The alternative, hardly acceptable, was to put seven so-called trend breaks into the series at each of the phase-in months, warning readers not compare data before and after.</p>
