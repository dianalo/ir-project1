<headline>JGBs up by noon on public fund purchases.</headline>

<p>The cash and futures Japanese government bonds (JGBs) were up by Tokyo noon on Tuesday led by large lot purchases by public funds, namely the Postal Savings System, traders said.</p>
<p>"Postal Savings appeared to have bought the longer-end of the cash bond market, driving up futures too," said a European bank trader.</p>
<p>U.S. speculative accounts bought back JGB futures as they might have thought the yen debt yield curve has steepened a bit too much, traders said. The key September was at 124.55 at noon, up from 124.10 on Monday.  </p>
<p>The yield of the benchmark 182nd 10-year JGB was at 2.310 percent at 0220 GMT, down from 2.375 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>Helped by demand from institutional investors, the September easily broke above its near-term resistance at 124.40 and 124.50 by noon.</p>
<p>Local agricultural financial institutions were on the buy-side in the market, accentuating the JGB's advance.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance (MOF) said on Monday that it would reduce its bimonthly issue volume of four-year and six-year JGBs to 400 billion yen each from their 500 billion yen each.</p>
