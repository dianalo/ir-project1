<p>Hollinger International Inc said on Wednesday its fourth quarter financial results for 1996 were hurt by costs of a special direct, prepaid subscription plan in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Hollister's Telegraph newspaper for the first time offered prepaid subscriptions to its readers, who formerly dealt directly with independent news agents. To gain acceptance, the new plan initially was offered at a loss, but the company said prices will be increased to make the plan profitable by the end of the year.</p>
<p>A one-time charge of $32.3 million was recorded as a result. Net revenue per share, including the charge, was $0.25 for the quarter, compared to a loss of $0.13 for the same quarter in 1995.</p>
