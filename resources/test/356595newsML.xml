<p>Zaire reinforced on two fronts on Wednesday to block twin rebel thrusts in its mineral-rich southern province of Shaba and further north along a major road from the east, a senior defence ministry official said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, relief workers reported a mass exodus of 40,000 Hutu refugees from a camp at Shabunda, about 200 km (120 miles) west of Bukavu on the Rwandan border, following reports of fighting in the region.</p>
<p>In the capital Kinshasa, a campaign to enlist 26,000 teenagers to help fight the war in the east began slowly, with recruiting officers awaiting instructions on how to proceed.</p>
<p>"We are in the process of sending reinforcements to defend Moba (in Shaba) and also to push them out of Kalemie (also in Shaba but further north)," the defence ministry official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said troops and equipment had also been sent to Lubutu on the road from the rebel-held east to Kisangani, headquarters for the government counter-offensive launched on January 20.</p>
<p>Kalemie on Lake Tanganyika is a strategic commercial transit point with rail, air and lake connections to the entire region. The army acknowledged its falling to the rebels on Monday.</p>
<p>Rebel leader Laurent Kabila told Reuters in Goma on Wednesday that veteran President Mobutu Sese Seko had until February 21 to start negotiations on handing over power or face a major rebel offensive.</p>
<p>Mobutu aides say he is on his way back to Zaire after further medical tests in Europe following prostate surgery there in August. He spent Tuesday and Wednesday in Morocco, which sent troops to help Mobutu crush Shaba revolts in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Zaire has repeatedly ruled out talks with the rebels, describing them as puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, two neighbours it accuses of invading its territory.</p>
<p>The Tutsi-led rebels launched their revolt in October, accusing Zaire of denying them citizenship and seeking to return them to Rwanda, which their forebears left generations ago. The army counter-offensive has made little apparent headway.</p>
<p>The defence ministry official said mercenaries, many of them from former Yugoslavia, remained deployed with the army much further north at the airport serving the rebel-held town of Watsa.</p>
<p>A director of the Sizarail company told Reuters at its headquarters in Kinshasa that trains were getting no further than Nyunzu, 150 km (90 miles) west of Kalemie.</p>
<p>Shaba's capital Lubumbashi was calm. "Everybody is talking about the capture of Kalemie but because the events are still over a thousand km away, the situation is still relatively calm and there is no panic yet," one inhabitant said by telephone.</p>
<p>But in Shabunda refugees fled west into the forest following reports of rebel advances. "The refugees started panicking," Ariane Quentier of the U.N. refugee agency said in Kinshasa.</p>
<p>In Europe, metal traders remained calm in the face of the escalation of hostilities into Shaba, saying fighting was having no impact on production or exports from the main mining areas.</p>
<p>In Kinshasa, a teenage mobilisation drive began slowly. Officials, awaiting written instructions on enrolment, told seven young hopefuls who turned out to come back next week.</p>
