<headline>Reuters move may not slay cash cow - analysts.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-09-11</dateline>

<p>Reuters Holdings Plc's decision to return 613 million pounds to shareholders via a special dividend share issue is a "neatly-structured deal", but may not address the company's problem of a growing cash surplus that earns low returns, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It's a neatly structured deal, but the problem of generating too much cash isn't going to go away," said one analyst who declined to be named.</p>
<p>Reuters is issuing 19 new ordinary shares plus one special dividend share which will pay net dividends totalling 750p over three years in exchange for 20 existing shares.  </p>
<p>The special dividends will be listed in Britain and the ADSs in the United States with trading beginning October 10.</p>
<p>The international news and information organisation said when it released its half-year results that its cash balances had grown to 866 million stg and that it was actively seeking ways to return cash to shareholders.</p>
<p>"By the end of the year they will have one billion stg cash in the bag and they're talking about distributing two-thirds of that excess after dividends are paid," said Panmure Gordon media analyst Anthony de Larrinaga.  </p>
<p>"Therefore the issue remains of excess cash, although the problem has been eased for the next three years."</p>
<p>Analysts said Reuters could reduce its cash by increasing its spending on acquisitions, but they said the company took a traditionally conservative approach on this.</p>
<p>"It is dangerous to pressure a management that is successful in its business to diversify just to reduce cashflow," de Larrinaga said.</p>
<p>However, he added that it would be better if Reuters were to consider other means of finding a better return on capital.  </p>
<p>Several analysts who declined to be named said Reuters was limited in its scope by two chief constraints, British tax authorities' rules and also the problem of unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax.</p>
<p>"This (special dividend share issue) is the best thing they could have done in the circumstances, but at the end of the day it's not enough," said one analyst who declined to be named.</p>
<p>"The best thing they could do as far as the balance sheet goes is to make a five billion stg acquisition, but they're famously conservative on that front. It's a conundrum...they have become a victim of their own success."  </p>
<p>Reuters shares closed 15-1/2p higher at 765-1/2p after hitting a day's high of 787p and they ranked as the second most actively traded stock in London as more than 13 million shares changed hands.</p>
<p>Analysts said that, in the short-term, investors would concentrate on the tax implications of the dividend issue, with a two-way pull developing in the stock.</p>
<p>Gross funds are seen buying shares to get access to the special dividend, which should earn them tax credits, with net funds seen selling in advance of the October 8 deadline for the dividend.</p>
<p>Reuters has not received comprehensive tax clearance for the move, but a company spokesman said it had received advice that it would not create a tax disadvanage for shareholders.</p>
<p>"We have been buyers and remain so. At these levels the shares are more fairly valued...for the gross funds there may be an impetus to acquire shares before they go ex-dividend," de Larrinaga said.</p>
