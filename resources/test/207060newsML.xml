<p>French finance minister Jean Arthuis said all of the government's forecast 27 billion francs privatisation revenues for 1997 would be set aside for capital injections into troubled state companies.</p>
<p>"The difficult situation of public sector companies means they should benefit from all of the (privatisation) sale revenues expected in 1997," he told the Senate.</p>
<p>Among the companies to be helped, Arthuis said, were troubled bank Credit Lyonnais, arms company Giat Industries and property lender Comptoir des Entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>"It is not possible to be more precise about how the money will be allocated," he said.</p>
<p>"Never has there been such a big effort to help public enterprises," he added. "Including the money targeted for 1997, nearly 120 billion francs will have been and will be set aside for this purpose," he said. More than half of that sum will be spent in 1996 and 1997, he said.</p>
<p>The government has pledged to mount a third rescue for Credit Lyonnais to allow it to be privatised as soon as possible.</p>
