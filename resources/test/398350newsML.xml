<p>Petrobel, a joint venture between the Egyptian state and International Egyptian Oil Company (IEOC), started production this month at two new offshore gas fields in the Nile Delta, Italian energy group ENI said in a statement.</p>
<p>IEOC is a unit of ENI's Agip SpA.</p>
<p>The Wakar field is producing 1.2 million cubic metres of gas per day and 3,700 barrels per day of condensates while Baltim South produces 330,000 cubic metres of gas per day and 315 barrels of condensates.</p>
<p>Including the Port Fouad and Nidoco 9 fields, which started production last year, Petrobel produces in the area 4.35 million cubic metres of natural gas per day and 8,220 barrels per day of gas liquids.</p>
<p>Agip has said it intends to continue exploiting the Egyptian fields. In 1997 wildcats will be drilled in three new fields in the East Delta Deep Marina concession to a depth of around 450 metres and offshore drilling will continue in the Temsah concession.</p>
<p>The work will be carried by the Agip/IEOC joint venture and Amoco/Egypt Oil.</p>
