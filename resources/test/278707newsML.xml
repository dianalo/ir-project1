<p>Japanese amusement equipment maker Sega Enterprises Ltd said on Friday that it had lowered its earnings forecast for the year to March 31, 1997, because it would get rid of its inventory of products related to its 16-bit machines and erase accumulated losses at its U.S. unit.  </p>
<p>Sega said in a statement that it would dispose of 16-bit machine-related products, worth about seven billion yen worldwide.</p>
<p>The move is expected to hit the earnings of Sega's U.S. unit Sega of America, which in turn will result in a cut in Sega's group current and net profit forecasts, Sega said.</p>
<p>It now expects group current profits of 11 billion yen in 1996/97, down from its November forecast of 27 billion yen, and a group net profit of 5.3 billion yen, down from its previous forecast of 10 billion yen.</p>
<p>Sega also said that it will post an extraordinary loss of about 23 billion yen in parent earnings for 1996/97 in order for its U.S. unit to erase its accumulated losses.</p>
<p>Due to the planned special loss, Sega said it had lowered its parent net profit forecast to 5.31 billion yen from the November forecast of 16 billion yen.</p>
<p>Despite the downward revision, Sega said that it had maintained its forecast for a total dividend of 38 yen for 1996/97. It paid a 38 yen dividend for 1995/96.</p>
