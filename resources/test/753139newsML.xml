<p>The International Monetary Fund, giving Kenya a final warning to improve energy sector management and take action in other fields, said a three-year loan would lapse unless the government acted within a week.</p>
<p>An IMF spokesman said measures taken so far fell short of IMF expectations. "Under the circumstances the current annual ESAF (Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility) arrangement will be allowed to lapse on July 1," he said.</p>
<p>"It could still be possible to complete the review of the ESAF if the Kenyan government were to take strong measures within the next week," he added.  </p>
<p>The IMF delayed the release of a $36 million tranche of the $205 million loan for a month last month amid concern about the government's handling of a multi-million dollar financial scandal.</p>
<p>The spokesman said an IMF mission had visited Kenya from July 13-22 to assess whether things had changed.</p>
<p>"The inability of the government to make use of several extensions of the first annual ESAF arrangement and take decisive steps to ensure transparancy and accountability in the use of public funds and resolve outstanding energy sector reform issues has a direct bearing on the prospects for attaining the objectives of the ESAF support program," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said the IMF would only reconsider if government strengthens management in the energy sector and makes firm commitments within one week to act in other areas, including "establishing accountability in relation to regular budgetary payments".</p>
