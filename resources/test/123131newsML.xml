<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Thursday gave partial support to his interior minister in bitter infighting against security chief Alexander Lebed, but he dismissed talk of "mutinies and putsches".</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin had summoned his top security staff to discuss allegations on Wednesday by Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov that Lebed was planning to create a force of about 50,000 men to seize power while President Boris Yeltsin awaits heart surgery.</p>
<p>"I do not conceal my concern over the fact that a considerable part of what Minister Kulikov said corresponds with reality," Interfax news agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying.</p>
<p>But he added: "(I am) far from thinking about mutinies and putsches".</p>
<p>Kulikov said on Wednesday that Lebed's plans amounted to a "creeping coup" while President Boris Yeltsin awaits a heart bypass operation planned for mid-November. Lebed denied the accusations.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin, addressing a cabinet meeting which followed his talks with security officials, condemned the rivalries that have intensified ahead of Yeltsin's operation.</p>
<p>A presidential spokesman said on Tuesday that the president had called for an end to the squabbling.</p>
<p>"The irresponsibility and incompetence of home-grown Bonapartism is clearly over the top," Interfax quoted Chernomyrdin as saying on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said the situation was difficult in the armed forces, which are underfunded and demoralised, but added that he would not allow anyone to use this to their own ends.</p>
<p>Chermomyrdin confirmed on Thursday that an order had been given to step up security in "especially dangerous places" but he gave no details.</p>
<p>Kulikov said on Wednesday that he had ordered extra security measures to cope with what he said was a threat of attacks by rebels from the breakaway Chechnya region.</p>
<p>The minister had earlier said that about 1,500 Chechen rebels would support Lebed's planned new force. The rebels denied the charge.</p>
