<p>France's opposition Socialists, hoping for an upset victory in a parliamentary election, accused the governing centre-right on Monday of playing cynical games with voters to confuse them over its future plans.</p>
<p>Key members of the majority, meanwhile, appeared to tighten their ranks around unpopular Prime Minister Alain Juppe, saying he could be reappointed if the coalition holds on to power in the snap May 25-June 1 poll.</p>
<p>"If the current majority wins a big victory, you shouldn't degrade a general on the evening of his victory. This would appear incongruous," said Francois Leotard, who heads the Union for French Democracy, the coalition's junior partner.</p>
<p>Juppe has become one of the top issues in the campaign leading up to the May 25-June 1 National Assembly election.</p>
<p>The left accuses him of failed leadership and deceiving the French people and warns against five more years of the same man at the government's helm.</p>
<p>The centre-right has also been tough on Juppe, criticising him for his programme as well as lacklustre leadership of the government's campaign. A number of majority members have hinted that Chirac should name a new team if the right wins.</p>
<p>But Socialist leader Lionel Jospin charged that the right's criticism of Juppe was part of a plan to fool voters into thinking that conservative President Jacques Chirac would dump him if it held on to power.</p>
<p>"If the right wins the election, I am convinced that Alain Juppe will again be prime minister. That seems extremely clear to me," Jospin said on French television LCI.</p>
<p>He said the right's swipes at Juppe, combined with recent conflicting statements on key campaign issues, were part of "a tactical and cynical game" on the part of the majority to trick voters into renewing their support for it.</p>
<p>"There are too many contradictory positions. You cannot say, like (National Assembly Speaker Philippe) Seguin, that we must bolster the state's authority and also, like (free-market advocate Alain) Madelin, that we must reduce it.</p>
<p>"Or say, as does (Labour Minister Jacques) Barrot, that we must preserve all social entitlements while hearing (Senate speaker Rene) Monory say that we must eliminate the minimum wage," Jospin said.</p>
<p>Jospin's suspicions appeared to be borne out by Gaullist candidate Patrick Stefanini, a close ally of the unpopular Juppe, who said it would be logical for Juppe to remain prime minister until France shifted to a single European currency at the start of 1999.</p>
<p>"There would be a certain logic for him to remain prime minister until this matter is wrapped up," he told Radio J.</p>
<p>No more opinion poll results will be published before the conclusion of the May 25-June 1 election under an official ban which took effect at midnight on Saturday.</p>
<p>But the final polls made public before the ban showed the governing centre-right in the lead and the leftist alliance of France's Socialists, Communists and ecologists gaining ground in what could end up a neck-and-neck contest.</p>
<p>The polls also found a third or more of voters saying they might change their minds before Sunday's first round.</p>
<p>"I have the feeling we are getting what marathon runners call a second wind, which will carry us to victory," Socialist Julien Dray said.</p>
<p>A close aide to Chirac said the president was weighing a second intervention in the campaign but may wait until after the first round before addressing the nation.</p>
<p>Francois Baroin, a Chirac speech-writer and political adviser, told Europe 1 radio the president would make up his mind in the next few days.</p>
<p>Jospin has said he would demand a right of reply if Chirac broadcast to the nation just before the first round of voting.</p>
