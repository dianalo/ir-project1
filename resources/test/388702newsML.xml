<p>Ford Motor Co.  said Wednesday it agreed to sell its heavy truck business to German-owned Freightliner Corp. in a move that will free up more capacity for two more vehicles at a truck-making plant in Louisville, Ky.</p>
<p>No financial terms were released for the deal, which includes the Louisville/AeroMax (HN80) trucks, Ford's service parts business and all remaining tooling for the Ford L-Series trucks and Ford Cargo truck, which is being phased out of production.</p>
<p>Freightliner, the U.S. truck subsidiary of Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, is based in Portland, Ore. Freightliner, which Daimler acquired in 1981, said the Ford deal would push its annual revenues to more than $595 million.</p>
<p>The Ford vehicles, which fall into the Class 6, Class 7 and Class 8 heavy truck categories, are sold in the United States, Canada and Australia.</p>
<p>"We've completed a thorough, strategic review of our heavy-truck operations and concluded that Ford resources can be better focused on our light and medium trucks with higher volumes as a core business," Jim Donaldson, vice president of Ford's Truck Vehicle Centre, said in a statement.</p>
<p>No real estate or employees are involved in the sale, and there are no layoffs anticipated as a result of the deal, said Ford spokesman Mike Jarvis. About 1,900 people now work on the heavy truck line at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant, which has 3,900 hourly employees</p>
<p>Ford plans to use the capacity vacated by the heavy truck line for two new light and medium trucks that will go into production in 1998, Jarvis said. He declined to provide more details about the new trucks.</p>
<p>Ford entered the heavy truck business in 1958 and peaked in sales in 1988 and 1989 when it reached 20 percent share of the heavy duty market. Ford sold a total of 44,389 Class 6,7 and 8 trucks in 1996 for a 15.2 percent share of the market. In 1995, Ford sold 56,278 units, accounting for 17 percent.</p>
<p>Ford introduced a new AeroMax heavy duty truck last fall, its first in about 25 years. Jarvis said Freightliner plans to continue to build the vehicle, but will change its name.</p>
<p>Jarvis declined to say if the business is profitable for Ford, but added, "We wouldn't be doing this if we'd been satisfied with the returns."</p>
<p>For Freightliner, the deal would add a vocational heavy truck used for construction, fire trucks, oil delivery, tankers and snow ploughs, as well as a distribution system that sells products through 257 dealers in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>Freightliner expects to operate separate sales divisions with separate dealer organisations for itself and the products acquired from Ford.</p>
<p>Freightliner President and Chief Executive Officer Jim Hebe said the company sees strategic value in a second heavy-truck line.</p>
<p>Ford's stock slipped 12.5 cents to $33.125 on the New York Stock Exchange. Daimler's U.S. shares lost 62.5 cents to $72.625, also on the NYSE.</p>
