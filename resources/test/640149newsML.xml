<p>The U.S. Army's top enlisted soldier has asked for permission to retire to avoid the possibility of a court-martial on pending charges of adultery and assault, the Pentagon said on Thursday.</p>
<p>But Defence Department spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters that no decision had been made and that the Army would have to grant Sergeant Major of the Army Gene McKinney, 46, a special waiver in order for him to retire while facing such charges.</p>
<p>"He has submitted a request for retirement. Any member of the military has the option of doing that at any time even if an investigation is under way," Bacon said.</p>
<p>"As long as he is under investigation, approval of the retirement request would require a waiver from Army headquarters," Bacon said.</p>
<p>The Army last month charged McKinney with adultery and assault in a case involving four military women in an ongoing sexual harassment scandal that has rocked the service. He has denied the charges.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials, who asked not to be identified, said they doubted McKinney would be granted a waiver to leave under what Bacon said he believed was a request to do so with an honourable discharge.</p>
<p>The Army is now determining whether or not to court-martial McKinney, the only soldier who carries the venerated military title sergeant major of the Army as leading member of the service's highest enlisted rank.</p>
<p>An investigator will decide if the 22-year veteran will face court-martial on any of the 18 charges of sexual misconduct and obstruction of justice involving three Army women and a female sailor over a three-year period.</p>
<p>McKinney was suspended in February from his Pentagon job as the senior enlisted adviser to service leaders pending resolution of sex harassment allegations lodged against him by former Sgt. Maj. Brenda Hoster.</p>
<p>Hoster, who has retired after 22 years service of her own, alleged she resisted pressure from McKinney to have sex in a hotel room in Hawaii last year while his wife was in another room down the hall.</p>
<p>McKinney is assigned to administrative duties at nearby Fort Myer, Va. He has remained on that job pending a determination of whether any of the charges might be dismissed and whether he would be tried.</p>
<p>The charges against McKinney include four counts each of indecent assault and maltreatment of soldiers, two counts of assault, one count of adultery, two of communicating a threat, two of obstruction of justice and three of soliciting adultery.</p>
<p>The incidents allegedly occurred between October 1994 and March of this year.</p>
<p>Aside from the sexual harassment charges, conviction of adultery by itself may be punished by jail and dismissal from the Army under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.</p>
<p>That code also prohibits sexual relations or even dating between troops of different rank.</p>
