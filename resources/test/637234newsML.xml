<p>Voters in two Orange County, Calif., cities defeated local tax measures in Tuesday's election, city officials said.</p>
<p>San Clemente's 2.5 percent utility tax was rejected with nearly 59 percent of the vote opposed to the measure.</p>
<p>Voters also defeated Stanton's $16.88-a-month public safety charge, with 71.5 percent voting against the measure.</p>
<p>The two levies were placed on the ballot because of California's Proposition 218, which strengthened existing law to require that all new local taxes be submitted to voters for approval.</p>
