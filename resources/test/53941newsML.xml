<p>Supporters of northern soccer club Atalanta, declaring themselves citizens of Umberto Bossi's would-be state "Padania", have threatened violence against fans from Italian club Fiorentina at a game on Sunday.</p>
<p>Florence vice police chief Sergio Traviani said an anonymous letter postmarked "Bergamo, Padania" had been sent last month to his office and to Fiorentina, whose fans clashed with supporters from Atalanta during the Italian Cup final last May.</p>
<p>Some 70 fans were injured at the match, won by Fiorentina.</p>
<p>"Do not return to Bergamo, lest it become your grave," the type-written letter read, according to Italian news agencies.</p>
<p>"Here, among the brothers of the free land, you will pay for everything and pay a high price," it added.</p>
<p>Bossi intends to declare "independence" for "Padania" on Sunday evening in Venice at the end of a symbol-laden "March to the Sea" along the River Po, Italy's longest river.</p>
<p>"The 15th of September will go down in history as a day of mourning for Florence and her sons," the letter concluded.</p>
<p>Traviani said Florence police would escort some 10 buses of Fiorentina supporters to Sunday's match in Bergamo.</p>
<p>"We've received similar threats for other games," Traviani told reporters. "But we're taking this seriously because we know there's no love lost between these groups of fans."</p>
