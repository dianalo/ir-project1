<p>Circon Corp, which received its latest takeover bid from U.S. Surgical Corp Tuesday, could ultimately be pressured by its own shareholders consider U.S. Surgical Corp's proposals that could lead to a sale of the company, arbitrageurs and analysts said.</p>
<p>U.S. Surgical bid $16.50 per share, above its last $14.50 per share offer but below its original $18 bid, made just over a year ago.  </p>
<p>Circon said after the close on Tuesday that its board would review U.S. Surgical's latest bid. It said shareholders "need not take any action at this time."</p>
<p>Analysts and takeover experts speculated after the latest bid that Circon could be asked by its shareholders to conduct an annual meeting to allow them to vote on U.S. Surgical board nominees and run an auction sale of the company.</p>
<p>Analysts said any shareholder meeting would come amid growing momentum favoring a U.S. Surgical deal: a $14.50 per share limited tender offer for Circon stock that ended three weeks ago was oversubscribed by more than four times, U.S. Surgical said.</p>
<p>"Circon shareholders were happy to give it up at $14.50, that is how willing they are" to do a deal with U.S. Surgical, said Eva Snitkin, analyst at Montgomery Securities.  </p>
<p>A Circon spokeswoman said the company has no meeting planned currently, but expects to make an announcement on the annual meeting by next week. She declined to comment further.</p>
<p>Circon, a Delaware company, is subject to a state law that allows shareholders to call an annual meeting if a company fails to do so within 13 months. Circon's last annual meeting was July 12, 1996.</p>
<p>The Delaware division of corporations said shareholders can petition the Delaware Chancery Court to force an annual meeting if 13 months have passed since the previous gathering.  </p>
<p>U.S. Surgical, owner of 14.8 percent of Circon's common stock, has nominated two directors for election to Circon's board and has proposed a non-binding resolution calling for a prompt sale of Circon to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>"You have to have a meeting in 13 months or you could get a petition. But with Circon, the two board nominations would still be a minority (on the five-member Circon board)," said an arbitrageur who declined to be named.  </p>
<p>A second arb, who requested anonymity, said that even though the U.S. Surgical nominees would not represent a Circon board majority to advance a deal, Circon's other directors may consider U.S. Surgical possibly proposing yet another director slate for the 1998 annual meeting.</p>
<p>"What is weird is how little the company (Circon) has done to respond to the bid. They have done nothing for a year, like restructuring, cutting costs..." the second arb said.  </p>
<p>Circon, based in Santa Barbara, Calif., makes endoscopes and miniature color video systems for medical and industrial applications. Norwalk, Conn.-based U.S. Surgical makes surgical staplers, products for minimally invasive surgery and other medical products.</p>
<p>A U.S. Surgical spokesman declined to say if the company intends to ask the court to force an annual meeting. He emphasized, though, the wide appeal of the limited tender offer for 973,174 Circon shares.  </p>
<p>That offer was limited because if U.S. Surgical increased its stock holdings beyond the 14.8 percent, it would trigger Circon's "poison pill" anti-takeover provision, a defense U.S. Surgical is currently contesting in court.</p>
<p>The battle within the medical device market began August 2, 1996 when U.S. Surgical announced an $18-per-share unsolicited bid, later rejected by Circon.</p>
<p>When U.S. Surgical's first offer was announced, Circon shares shot above 19 from around 12, and hit the current intraday, year-high 19-1/2 several days later. U.S. Surgical argued $18 was an 83 percent premium above Circon's average closing price stock over the prior ten trading days.</p>
<p>The last December, U.S. Surgical cut the offer to $17 per share and two months ago, the bid again was reduced, to $14.50 per share for the limited tender because of Circon's poor first-quarter performance, U.S. Surgical then said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Circon shares added 5/8 to 15-1/2 on Nasdaq while U.S. Surgical slipped 1/4 to 36-1/2 on the NYSE.</p>
