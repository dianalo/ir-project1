<p>Emery Worldwide said it has begun wholly-owned company operations in Portugal with the opening of service centres in Lisbon and Oporto.</p>
<p>These mark Emery's first major presence in the country and are part of its strategic and long-term plans to strengthen its network of wholly owned European subsidiaries, it added in a statement.</p>
<p>The new general manager for Portugal is Paulo Jesus reporting to Sergio Urbinati, Emery's division general manager for Italy, Spain, Greece and Portugal, the statement said.</p>
<p>Emery president and chief executive officer, David Beatson said that that Portugese airfreight rose by 24 percent in 1996 and the move will enable Emery to participate in the country's growth.</p>
<p>Lisbon is the Portuguese centre for inbound traffic and Oporto the centre for outbound.</p>
<p>Emery last year opened wholly owned companies in Hungary and Finland as part of its European network and, since 1995, has expanded its company operations in Argentina, Chile, Venezuela. and Taiwan as part of its global expansion programme, the statement said. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax:5017</p>
