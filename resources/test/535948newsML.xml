<headline>Nasdaq shares flat as techs fail to ride IBM wave.</headline>

<p>Nasdaq shares finished virtually flat after technology stocks failed to benefit from the excitement surrounding International Business Machines Corp's better-than-expected first quarter results, traders said.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index gained 0.95 points or 0.08 percent to close unofficially at 1228.09. Declining issues and gaining issues were almost even at 2005 to 2073, respectively on volume of almost 599 million shares.</p>
<p>"Techs got a boost yesterday ahead of IBM's results. They had their gain then, so they weren't likely to get a double-benefit today. But most everyone managed to hold on to the gains," one trader said.</p>
<p>Large capitalization technology stocks Intel Corp, and Cisco Systems Inc softened only slightly, while Microsoft Corp dropped one to 114-1/8. Dell Computer Corp gained 1-7/8 to 81-1/4.</p>
<p>Avid Technology Inc and U.S. Robotics Corp both jumped after their quarterly results topped Wall Street expectations. MCI Communications Corp, however, dropped 1-3/8 to 37-3/8 after it posted flat first quarter earnings and warned that growth might slow.</p>
