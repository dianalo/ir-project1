<p>The Treasury Department said on Thursday a net $4.1 billion of government securities were reconstituted in November, compared with $413.7 million that were reconstituted in October.</p>
<p>The Strips, or Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities program, are created by separating the interest coupon from the principal payment. Securities can be reconstituted by rejoining the principal and coupon.</p>
<p>Treasury said $928.14 billion of securities were eligible for stripping in November. Of the total, $223.14 billion were held in stripped form on Nov 30, compared with $227.22 billion on Oct 31.</p>
