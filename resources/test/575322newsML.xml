<p>Bulgaria's second biggest oil refinery Plama, which was partially privatised last September, is working at one-third capacity while it awaits permission to import oil through the Black Sea port of Bourgas.</p>
<p>Atanas Kolarov, president of Bulgarian oil trader Euroenergy Holding, which bought 75 percent of the refinery, said his company needed an agreement to use the oil terminal at Bourgas owned by the state-owned Neftochim refinery.</p>
<p>"We have signed a long-term contract with France's Elf Aquitaine , which could start immediate crude supplies for the refinery," Kolarov told Reuters.</p>
<p>Under the contract Elf would sell 250,000 tonnes of Plama's diesel production on the international market by the end of the year, he said.</p>
<p>"State institutions are creating difficulties for the refinery and thus for the development of the private sector. We need a clear strategy from the state and no differentiation between local and foreign investors," Kolarov said.</p>
<p>Kolarov said once Plama started crude imports it would be able to return to full capacity of 80,000 tonnes per month. The refinery will also increase its employees from 2,200 now.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old refinery in the town of Pleven is currently working at one-third of its production capacity, producing lubricating oils for the domestic market, he said.</p>
<p>The government liberalised fuel prices last week. Plama's production can now compete with imported lubricants and the refinery has some prospect of paying off some of its debts and becoming a going concern.</p>
<p>Plama suspended production for several months in 1995 and 1996 due to a lack of cash to buy crude.</p>
<p>Euroenergy has paid more than $7 million of Plama's debts, Kolarov said, adding that the company had also started an investment programme aimed at technical repairs.</p>
<p>"We have asked the banks to reschedule Plama's debts and four of the 10 or 12 creditor banks have already agreed," Kolarov said.</p>
<p>The Plama privatisation, carried out under the previous Socialist government, attracted criticism because the price of 62 million levs (then about $300,000) was seen as low.</p>
<p>The refinery had debts of $100 million but part of the debt was to Euroenergy itself, which had been supplying the refinery with crude and selling its production. -- Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-91188</p>
