<p>U.S. multinational companies operating in Hong Kong will pay tax the same way to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) after July 1, according to a leading U.S. accounting firm.</p>
<p>The U.S. Internal Revenue Service issued a guideline that it will continue to treat Hong Kong and China as two seprate countries after July 1, said Coopers and Lybrand in its Daily Tax Report dated June 27.</p>
<p>Historically, Hong Kong has been treated as a separate country. Because of its low corporate tax rate at 16.5 percent, revenues from Hong Kong are subject to "subpart F" of the IRS tax code, which seeks to curb the inappropriate deferral of taxes.</p>
<p>Under the ruling, a U.S. multinational company with a subsidiary in Hong Kong would continue to declare most earnings of that subsidiary on the current basis, said Stanley Sherwood, an international tax expert at the firm.</p>
<p>If Hong Kong and China were to be treated as one country for U.S. tax purposes, some of the taxation from that subsidiary may have been eligible for deferral, he said. Many lobbying groups had rallied to obtain new tax treatment for Hong Kong, he added.  </p>
<p>"It is not a surprise," Sherwood said, referring to the eagerly awaited tax ruling that affirms the status quo. "But it is not an enlightened legal analysis."</p>
<p>To uphold the status quo, the IRS explained that Hong Kong historically has been treated as a separate country for purposes of the U.S. tax code.</p>
<p>As a "Special Administration Region" (SAR) of China, Hong Kong is no different from the SAR Shenzhen in the Guandong province, he said.</p>
<p>"The child is going back to the mother," Sherwood said. "It is one country."</p>
