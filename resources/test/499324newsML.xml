<headline>Slovak SAX index slips on losses to Nafta shares.</headline>

<p>The Slovak SAX index eased slightly in moderate trading on the Bratislava Stock Exchange on Thursday, pushed down by losses to shares of oil and gas storage company Nafta  NAFT.BV.</p>
<p>Nafta fell 60 crowns to 1,600, with its average price -- used for calculating the index -- slipping 4.4 percent as the SAX eased 0.86 points to 204.87.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected Nafta's share price to fall further. "The firm has a majority owner, which, combined with its bad image among investors, supports our expectation of a further price decline," Dusan Sykora of ING Barings said.</p>
<p>Steel maker VSZ was most active among listed issues with 3,060 shares changing hands, closing unchanged at 745 crowns.</p>
<p>Oil refiner Slovnaft closed down five crowns at 995, with brokers not expecting any significant moves with its price amid expectations over the company's dividend policy.</p>
<p>Overall volume fell to 181.416 shares, from 527,757 stocks traded on Wednesday, while turnover decreased to 70.52 million crowns from 340.74 million.</p>
