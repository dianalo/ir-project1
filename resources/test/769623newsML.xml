<title>USA: CBOT soybeans end sharply up on weather, exports.</title>
<headline>CBOT soybeans end sharply up on weather, exports.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-07-31</dateline>

<p>CBOT soybean futures posted double-digit gains on Thursday, powered by forecasts for continued dry weather in the U.S. Midwest and weekly export sales data that came in above expectations, traders said.</p>
<p>"It's more or less a weather dominated market," said Mario Balletto, oilseeds analyst with Merrill Lynch. "The outlook is drier for next week. The crop needs more rain and not enough rain is being forecast right now. The anticipation of yield losses is starting to develop."</p>
<p>Hot, dry weather can stress soybeans during blooming. USDA on Monday said 68 percent of the crop was blooming.</p>
<p>Forecasts called for temperatures to warm up this weekend with no significant precipitation expected for central Illinois in the next seven to 10 days, meteorologists said.</p>
<p>August also notched strong gains after the U.S. Agriculture Department said net export sales of old crop soy during the week ended July 24 totalled 125,300 tonnes, above expectations for 50,000 to 100,000 tonnes. New crop sales totalled 195,400 tonnes, below expectations.</p>
<p>Soybeans ended 24-1/2 to six cents per bushel higher with new crop November up 24-1/4 at $6.58 and August up 11-1/2 at $7.68.  </p>
<p>Traders said bullishly construed weather forecasts pushed new crop soybeans into technical buy areas. Chartists noted the November contract plowed through the 50-day moving average and also filled a gap above $6.47. That hole in the charts was left after the June 30 USDA acreage report put 1997 U.S. soybean plantings at a hefty 70.9 million acres.</p>
<p>As expected, there were no soybeans posted Thursday for delivery on the August contract. Thursday was first notice day for deliveries on the August soy complex futures.</p>
<p>Commercials were said to be both outright buyers of the nearbys and bull spreaders. Commercials were also buying call options, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Cargill Inc spread two million bushels August/November at $1.28 to $1.30, premium August. Continental Grain and Iowa Grain were also said to be bull spreaders.</p>
<p>Term Commodities bought 1,200 September $7.00 calls at 9-1/2 to 10 cents. Term also bought 700 November $7.00 calls at 14 cents and 200 September $6.75 calls at 19 cents.</p>
<p>Volatility in the November closed at 27-1/2 percent, up from 27 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Funds bought at least 20 million bushels of soybeans on the day, led by Refco Inc. Refco bought at least 10.5 million bushels November, Prudential Securities and Cargill Investor Services each bought three million November and Griffin Trading bought 3.5 million November.</p>
<p>Soybean futures volume was estimated by CBOT at 88,000 contracts, compared with Wednesday's actual volume of 60,570. Options volume was pegged at 23,000 contracts, against Wednesday's 20,587.</p>
