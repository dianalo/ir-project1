<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright left Russia on Friday after holding a second, unscheduled round of talks with Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov to try to narrow differences over NATO's planned eastward expansion.</p>
<p>Neither made any comment after the talks -- which had delayed Albright's departure from Moscow -- aimed at shaping a NATO-Russia security charter designed to calm Russian fears over the alliance's enlargement to include former East Bloc states.</p>
<p>Albright and Primakov met for two hours on Thursday and said later they had made progress but that tough issues remained to be resolved if a May 27 target date for signing the charter was to be met.</p>
<p>NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, who leads the talks for the alliance, is to see Primakov in Luxembourg on May 6.</p>
<p>Western officials say the charter would set up a joint council with the Russians which would give Moscow a voice in key decisions affecting its security interests in Europe.</p>
<p>But Russia is demanding binding guarantees from NATO that it will not move nuclear arms or conventional forces into the territory of new members.</p>
<p>NATO says it has no plans to do so, but is reluctant to be tied down legally.</p>
<p>The names of a first group of countries to be invited to join the alliance -- probably Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic -- are expected to be announced at a NATO summit in Madrid in July.</p>
<p>Also holding up the charter negotiations is the failure so far of 30-nation Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) talks in Vienna to agree on new force levels on Russia's borders in the new post-Cold War era.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Albright told an audience of Russian intellectuals and academics that NATO expansion would be in Russia's interests and painted a disastrous scenario of what would happen if it did not take place.</p>
<p>The prospect of joining NATO was already forcing eastern European countries to resolve old ethnic and border disputes, and their membership would give them confidence to pursue arms control and build closer ties with Russia, she said.</p>
<p>"It is precisely because NATO is taking in new members that we can now avert the threat of a major military build-up in central Europe," Albright said at the Carnegie Centre.</p>
<p>But if NATO did not enlarge, old dividing lines would re-emerge, confidence would disintegrate in eastern Europe "and a new destabilising scramble for security would result", causing relations to crumble between Russia and its neighbours.</p>
<p>Albright said NATO's CFE proposals would ensure that each state maintained only the military capabilities needed for its legitimate security needs, "so no NATO member, old or new, can become a staging ground for potential attack against Russia."</p>
