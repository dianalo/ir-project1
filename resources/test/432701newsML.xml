<p>South African chemical, oils and plastics group AECI Ltd said on Tuesday it expected real earnings growth in the year ahead.</p>
<p>Announcing its results for the year to December 31, which showed a 7.8 percent increase in earnings to 275 cents per share, the group said there was growing evidence of government's resolve to pursue policies which would lead to higher economic growth.</p>
<p>"Given steadfast implementation of this resolve and at least reasonable climatic conditions, the enhanced competitiveness and financial strength of the group make it well positioned to achieve real growth in earnings in 1997," it said.</p>
<p>The group reported turnover up 11.9 percent to 7.51 billion rand in the year, helped by a healthy improvement in earnings at fertilizer division Kynoch and higher export sales.</p>
<p>Managing director Mike Smith told Reuters that of the 34 percent rise in export earnings to 1.464 billion rand, around 19 percent accounted for the rand's depreciation against the dollar last year.</p>
<p>"If you translated everything into dollar terms it was about a 15 percent gain in volume and price," Smith said.</p>
<p>Finance costs rose to 242 million rand from 203 million rand the year before, although this was expected to be sharply reduced in the year ahead after the company reduced net short-term borrowings by 1.01 billion rand in the period.</p>
<p>Smith noted that while the proceeds of the realisation of AECI's investment in Afex had been the major contributor to the reduction in borrowings, improved cash flow was also a contributor.</p>
<p>Excluding the 864 million rand proceeds of the Afex realisation, net borrowings at year end were 120 million rand lower than at December 1995.</p>
<p>"This pleasing improvement in cash generation was the result of higher profits and lower capital expenditure, together with markedly better management of working capital costs across the group."</p>
<p>Smith said that the group's restructuring in recent years, when it had closed down operations, reduced costs and rid itself of non-core companies had left AECI's cost base in better shape, enabling it to compete both locally and internationally.</p>
<p>"I think the company is in good shape from a cost point of view and straight balance sheet point of view and we are reasonably confident about prospects for the year ahead," he said.</p>
