<p>Telecom Corp of New Zealand's share price may fall after investment house Salomon Brothers downgraded the stock to 'hold' from 'buy' on Tuesday, local brokers warned.</p>
<p>Salomon made its Telecom downgrade recommendation because it said it believed "the upturn in the company's business appears to be moving further into the future".</p>
<p>Dr Don Turkington, managing director of brokerage firm Cavill White Securities, said the market had historically paid close attention to Salomon's appraisal of Telecom.</p>
<p>"They were one of the first international firms to strongly recommend it as a buy some years ago, so their research on Telecom New Zealand is taken account of," he said.</p>
<p>Brokers said Telecom's gains in recent weeks, from NZ$6.62 on May 15 to NZ$6.99 at Tuesday's close, were primarily due to the company's ongoing share buyback programme.</p>
<p>This is taking place both in New Zealand and in the U.S. where Telecom's two largest owners Ameritech and Bell Atlantic are based.</p>
<p>Telecom aims to repurchase NZ$1 billion ($694 million) of its own shares this year in an effort to achieve greater leverage from its capital.</p>
<p>The second of four repurchase periods began shortly after Telecom announced its year profit result on May 14.</p>
<p>"The stock has performed brilliantly well since the buyback started and there's a real unwillingness by institutions to sell into a market when it's been rising do strongly," Turkington said.</p>
<p>"But having said that, it's risen from the low NZ$6.60s to nearly NZ$7.00 over this most recent buyback buyback programme -- there could well be some selling come in."</p>
<p>Both British and U.S. markets were closed on Monday for holidays and brokers said Telecom's recent strong gains, combined with the Salomon report, could trigger a bout of profit-taking when offshore investors return to their offices.</p>
<p>"It has run hard recently," said Tim Koller at Merrill Lynch. "You may well see some profit-taking, and the Salomon Brothers (view) could contribute to that."</p>
<p>Analysts' valuations of Telecom stock currently range from NZ$5.85 to NZ$7.30, another market observer noted. (US$=NZ$1.44)</p>
