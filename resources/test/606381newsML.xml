<p>The continued weakness in demand for UK manufactured goods has begun to affect manufacturers' output growth expectations, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The CBI said that export demand was at its lowest level since November 1993, but there was a glimmer of hope because of continued strength in home demand.</p>
<p>"Our survey shows that the strength of sterling is continuing to take its toll on manufacturers' ability to win export orders," said Sudhir Junankr, the CBI's associate director of economic analysis.</p>
<p>The latest CBI monthly trend survey for May shows that 27 percent of firms consider their total order books to be below normal, while 19 percent said they were above normal, leaving a negative balance of eight percent compared with negative balances of seven percent in April and one percent in March.</p>
<p>Overseas demand remained weak in May, with a balance of 24 percent of manufacturers reporting that export orders were below normal, compared with negative balances of 23 percent in April and 18 percent in March.</p>
<p>As a result of weak overseas demand, manufacturers said they were less optimistic about output expectations over the next four months, compared with March and April surveys. A positive balance of 17 percent of companies surveyed said they expected output to increase, compared with positive balances in April and March.</p>
<p>"However, there is a ray of hope as home demand is holding up. Maufacturers still expect to step up their production over the coming months, although their growth experctations have been scaled down in this survey," Junankar said.</p>
<p>"The outlook for output price inflation also remains highly promising and the modest price expectations are the same as those recorded this time last year," he said.</p>
<p>A positive balance of four percent of firms expect prices to rise of the next four months, the same as recorded this time last year, the survey showed. This compares with a balance of zero in April and of plus nine percent in March.</p>
