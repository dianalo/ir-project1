<p>IMC Global Inc said Wednesday it is temporarily reducing output at three of its potash mines in Saskatchewan by slightly extending Christmas shutdown schedules.</p>
<p>"While our overall inventories are in excellent shape, these measured cutbacks will further ensure that we enter the new year in a strong position that will support our marketing efforts," John Huber, president of IMC Kalium, the potash business unit, said in a statement. "We are committed to the ongoing supply-side management of our operations."  </p>
<p>Huber said that the extended production cutbacks will reduce IMC Kalium's potash output by about 200,000 tons, nearly double the normal tonnage reduction during this seasonal shutdown.</p>
<p>Mines affected by the cutback are the Esterhazy, K-1 mine, which was shut down December 16 and will remain closed until January 4; the K-2 mine, which will be shut from December 20 until January 2, and Central Canada Potash in Colonsay, which will be down from December 23 until January 2.</p>
<p>IMC is one of the world's leading producers and marketers of phosphate and potash crop nutrients and animal feed ingredients.</p>
