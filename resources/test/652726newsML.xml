<p>The Polish zloty held virtually flat against the basket of currencies on Wednesday with foreign investors remaining on the sidelines during the light session.</p>
<p>The zloty mirrored dollar/mark trends on world markets and remained around resistance at 1.5 percent above parity all day -- the level where the zloty was expected to stay for the next several days, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The zloty tracked dollar/mark with little other movements on the market. It seems likely to remain at 1.5 percent for the next few days," said Tomasz Nowakowski, forex dealer at Bank Handlowy SA.  </p>
<p>The zloty closed at 1.52/1.49 percent from the trading band centre, a touch down from Tuesday's close at 1.56/1.50 percent.</p>
<p>It closed at 3.2230/40 to the dollar, down from 3.2175/95 on Tuesday and at 1.8779/84 to the mark, up from 1.8795/05.</p>
<p>The central bank chief Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz said the bank was satisfied with the current level of the zloty and saw no inflationary pressure resulting from its recent weakening.</p>
<p>The zloty lost more than two percent late in May amid a foreign investor withdrawal from the region triggered by the Czech crown's slump before rebounding one percent to 1.5 percent from parity.  </p>
<p>The average yield of the 39-week T-bill increased 0.05 point to 21.48 percent at Wednesday's tender, while the 26-week yield rose 0.07 to 21.44 percent. The finance ministry sold 336 million zlotys of the bills at the 600 million zloty auction.</p>
<p>Overnight and tomorrow/next rates both fell about 30 basis points to close at 21.95/22.15 and 22.05/22.25 percent respectively as banks continued to have surpluses in monthly average reserve positions.</p>
