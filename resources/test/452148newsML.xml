<p>Duke Power Co said on Wednesday its proposed $7.7 billion merger with PanEnergy Corp had received approval by regulators in South Carolina.</p>
<p>Duke Power said it signed a stipulation containing certain conditions, including one in which it agreed not to raise retail rates to customers through the year 2000.</p>
<p>However, the company said it may adjust rates with regulatory approval to reflect a "substantial impact" on the company, such as action by the government affecting the industry or major catastrophes, such as a storm, that causes substantial financial damage.</p>
<p>It said the stipulation does not include Duke Power's annual fuel clause adjustment, by which regulators modify rates slightly to accurately reflect fuel costs incurred by the company.</p>
<p>Hearings are also being held in Raleigh, N.C. regarding the merger, Duke Power said.</p>
<p>Besides South and North Carolina, other approvals needed for the merger include the Feeral Energy Regulatory Commission and shareholders of both company, Duke Power said.</p>
