<p>South Korea's LG Group said on Friday it signed a contract to take over an unlisted unit of Jinro Ltd for two billion won.  </p>
<p>An LG Group spokesman said several units in the nation's third-biggest conglomerate would buy a 78 percent stake in Jinro Engineering Co. LG Construction will hold the biggest stake but he gave no further details.</p>
<p>The group is negotiating with Jinro's joint-venture partner, Fortifikasjon of Norway, to take over the rest.</p>
<p>"The takeover is aimed at reinforcing the underground building business into our construction fields," he said.</p>
<p>Jinro Engineering, capitalised at one billion won, posted 27.3 billion in sales last year. No comparative figures were given for 1995.  </p>
<p>The troubled Jinro Group said on Thursday it would sell 12 of its 18 affiliates and property to raise over 840 billion won by the end of this year to rescue six affiliates. The rescue plan was established to normalise business operations of the six Jinro Group affiliates designated in April for a bail out.</p>
<p>The LG Group spokesman said his group was still negotiating to buy a bus terminal site in Seoul owned by Jinro Group.</p>
<p>Jinro Group buckled under 3.2 trillion won in debt in April, mostly as a result of reckless expansion.</p>
