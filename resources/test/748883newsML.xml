<headline>Russian MinFins rise sharply on Greenspan's remark.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-07-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>Some tranches of Russian MinFin bonds touched all-time highs on Wednesday as dealers marked up prices while waiting for new funds after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>But dealers differed as to when new investment would flow in.</p>
<p>			tranche   July 23		 July 22 (close)</p>
<p>    1999 maturity   (3)     91.00-91.25	   90.50</p>
<p>    2003 maturity   (4)     68.65-68.85	   67.63</p>
<p>    2008 maturity   (5)     51.10-51.35	   50.13</p>
<p>    2006 maturity   (6)     57.00-57.25	   55.63</p>
<p>    2011 maturity   (7)     45.00-45.25	   44.00</p>
<p>"Greenspan's speech gave a powerful boost to the market," said Banco Santander dealer Dmitry Dorofeyev.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market took Greenspan's speech as proof there would be no hikes in U.S. interest rates in the near future and that they could pour new money into securities.</p>
<p>Moscow Business World Bank dealer Sergei Kovzharov said the market was waiting for New York's opening. He said U.S. orders could break the resistance level and ignite a rise for a few "Investment conditions are most favourable now," he said.</p>
<p>Dorofeyev said profit-taking might set in in the next few days. He said a sharp rise in the price of benchmark U.S. 30-year Treasuries after Greenspan's speech made investment in risky emerging debt more attractive.</p>
<p>But he said the rise was not yet backed by real money, but was based on market operators' speculation. "What is going on now is purely dealers' activity on expectation of clients' demand," he said. "It usually takes some time for investors to digest news and take decisions."</p>
