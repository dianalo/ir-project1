<p>*The Australian 10-year bond futures contract continued to edge away from the 1994 peak of 93.630 in SYCOM trade, touching another all-time of high of 93.680.</p>
<p>*Prices of U.S. Treasuries recovered from a volatile opening, ending higher for the fourth successive session.</p>
<p>The Australian 10-year bond futures contract continued to edge away from the 1994 peak of 93.630 in SYCOM trade, touching another all-time high of 93.680, and will look to press higher after Friday's likely consolidation.</p>
<p>The contract ended after hours trade at 93.660, up from Thursday's 93.625 open outcry close and after bouncing from a session low of 93.575.</p>
<p>Peter Pontikis, technical strategist at Westpac, said the contract is mirroring the positive trend of U.S. debt and to a lesser extent the short end of the local curve, and expects a move into the 93.700s after consolidating a 93.580/93.666 range.  </p>
<p>The contract had touched a peak of 93.675 on Thursday after weaker than expected monthly and quarterly retail trade data, although the market now falls into a data void with the next major release not due until next Thursday's labour force report.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries ended firm for the fourth straight day, recovering from a volatile opening amid a barrage of data and faces the key non-farm payrolls report later on Friday.</p>
<p>Second quarter U.S. GDP rose 2.2 percent, slightly above expectations, but the first quarter was revised down to 4.9 from 5.9 percent. Other data saw weekly jobless claims fall, while the Chicago purchasing manager's survey declined.</p>
