<p>Political tension mounted in Britain on Thursday ahead of a cabinet meeting at which Prime Minister John Major could name the day for an election that may spell the end of 18 years of Conservative rule.</p>
<p>With most politicians already expecting voting to take place on May 1, aides to Major dodged questions about whether the meeting, starting at 1030 GMT, would discuss overtly political issues, such as election tactics and timing.</p>
<p>Political observers see strong reasons for Major to make the polling date public this week, as this would enable him to use a speech he is due to deliver on Saturday to the annual meeting of his party's Central Council to launch his campaign.</p>
<p>Major, his Conservatives some 20 points behind the opposition Labour Party in the polls, must hold an election by May 22, but has said he regards May 1 as the latest realistic alternative.</p>
<p>If he does tell his cabinet colleagues the date, he could go immediately after the meeting to Buckingham Palace to ask Queen Elizabeth to approve arrangements for polling. Only after this would a public announcement be made.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, opposition leader Tony Blair warned his Labour Party against complacently assuming that its huge opinion poll lead means that it is certain to return to power for the first time since 1979.</p>
<p>He told party members at a London dinner: "Though many people may write off the Tories, and take the voters' verdict for granted, I for one do not. I remain the eternal warrior against complacency."</p>
<p>It is Blair's modernisation of his party, forcing it to cast off traditional socialist policies, that has combined with disunity among Conservatives, particularly over Europe, to give Labour its best chance of power for almost two decades.</p>
<p>In recent days, the Conservatives have unveiled a raft of policies designed to convince voters that they have not run out of steam and deserve a fifth successive election victory.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell on Wednesday annnounced plans to virtually end the role of local authorities in running homes for the elderly.</p>
<p>He said if the Conservatives retained power, they would bring in a law reserving the role for commercial organisations and voluntary bodies except where they could not provide services.</p>
<p>Other recent Conservative initiatives have included a plan to reduce the state's role in pension provision by letting workers use tax breaks to purchase provision for their old age.</p>
<p>However, Conservative efforts have been hit by a spate of controversies, notably over allegations that a failure to enforce inspection standards at abattoirs is putting meat-eating Britons at risk of exposure to lethal bacteria.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg was forced to make a statement to parliament on Wednesday to defend the actions of his ministry. He accused Labour of scaremongering and unveiled an eight-point plan to improve abattoir hygiene.</p>
