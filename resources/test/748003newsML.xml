<p>Mozambican farmers are slowly trying to revive the country's agricultural sector, but the government says it is still cheaper to import cereals.</p>
<p>"What we want to do is be self-sufficient, but it is still less expensive to bring in cereals from neighbouring countries," Eneias Comiche, Economic and Social Affairs Minister in the presidency, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Comiche said the movement of farm goods from rural to consumer areas was a major problem due to a lack of roads and suitable transport.</p>
<p>Development of the sector also lagged due to lack of credit facilities and support structures for farmers, many of whom produce by hand.</p>
<p>Mozambique exported maize last year for the first time in years, but Comiche said this year it faces a cereal deficit of 100,000 tonnes due to heavy floods in central and southern provinces and drought in the north.</p>
<p>The U.N.'s World Food Programme (WFP) said drought was possible again next year due to the El Nino weather phenomenon.</p>
<p>The cashew nut industry still dominates agriculture with output rising in 1996 to 65,000 tonnes from 33,423 the previous year. It is one of the country's biggest foreign exchange earners. Dom Scalpelli, WFP project officer, said a second minor crop in August will give a clearer idea of 1997 production.</p>
<p>Trade has boomed in Mozambique since the end of a 16-year civil war in 1992, followed by elections in 1994. Peace and economic liberalisation increased business confidence.</p>
<p>Farmers currently cultivate on average just over a hectare of land and Western aid officials, working in the countryside, say many are realising the impact of the new open market.</p>
<p>"People have never been encouraged to sell before, but they are now finding there is a market," one official said.</p>
<p>The WFP said, however, the increase in food production since last year was more due to favourable weather and political stability than to the impact of reforms in the sector.</p>
<p>Some aid officials say the arrival of the first 13 South African farmers who have been granted rights on a former state farm in the northern province of Niassa is also a key factor.</p>
<p>"What the country needs is the little push that the South African farmers will give the sector," one official said.</p>
<p>Data from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development shows total area planted increased by six percent in 1996-97 to 3,627,000 hectares, but heavy rains had damaged about 130,000 hectares of food crops, including 45,000 hectares of maize along the rivers in some central and southern provinces.</p>
<p>The agriculture sector employs over 80 percent of the labour force with employment in non-farms sectors very limited.</p>
<p>The issue of land tenure being debated in parliament, which will appropriate land to individuals, companies and communities, is seen as necessary to build confidence among farmers working on state land.</p>
<p>"Mozambique is very close to food sufficiency, which will allow people to survive, but it won't make them develop," one aid official said.</p>
