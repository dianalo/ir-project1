<p>Israeli shares closed slightly higher on Thursday in very quiet trading as investors waited for fresh news, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of top 100 shares rose 0.73 percent, or 1.87 points, to 257.69 on a low all-share turnover of 93 million shekels against 106 million shekels on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index closed 0.77 percent higher at 265.42.</p>
<p>"The session opened with a mild rise. During the day investors gained confidence and the market continued rising. Volume was low because investors did not want to take any risks before the weekend," said Yossi Weidelfeld at Eyal Securities.</p>
<p>He said that if nothing dramatic happened in New York over the weekend, the market would continue rising on Sunday.</p>
<p>"It seems now that the positive momentum has ended. The market continued rising but because of the thin volume it's meaningless," said Ronen Kaufman of Nesuah Trading and Investments.</p>
<p>"There is no reason for a further rise. The February CPI is expected to be around 1.2 percent, the Bank of Israel will not lower its key lending rate and share prices are less attractive," Kaufman added.</p>
<p>Tadiran, the main gainer on the Maof, surged 5.0 percent to 9,568 agorot. Tadiran said on Thursday it had signed a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. company Exide Corp to develop and produce lithium batteries.</p>
<p>The most active shares were Israel Chemicals, which gained 2.75 percent to 398 agorot on turnover of 6.0 million shekel; Bank Leumi, which rose 3.75 percent to 569 agorot on volume of 5.8 million shekels; and Koor Industries, which gained 1.75 percent to 32,319 agorot on volume of 4.1 million shekels.</p>
