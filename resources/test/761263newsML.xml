<p>Australia's money-losing pay-TV industry appears to be heading for another court battle following the announcement of a proposed merger between Australis Media Ltd and rival Foxtel.</p>
<p>Optus Vision, the other player in the industry, has already denounced the proposed tie-up, unveiled late on Friday.</p>
<p>Optus, owned by Optus Communications Pty Ltd, would not comment on Monday on whether it had started legal proceedings but analysts said legal action was likely and a formal announcement was expected later this week.  </p>
<p>The legal moves could potentially block the merger, which would create Australia's largest pay-TV group. Foxtel is equally owned by Rupert Murdoch's The News Corp Ltd and the Australian government's telecommunications carrier, Telstra.</p>
<p>Legal action would also complicate the proposed partial float of Telstra, scheduled for November, but analysts said a delay of the float seemed unlikely at this stage.</p>
<p>Media and telecommunications analysts said legal action was likely to be aimed at winning an agreement from Foxtel over programming and possibly infrastructure access.  </p>
<p>"Optus clearly does not want to be cut out totally and it probably has a plan up it sleeve already," said a Melbourne-based media industry analyst.</p>
<p>Optus has already said it will complain to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) about the merger on the basis that it would reduce competition in the industry.</p>
<p>Optus chief executive Peter Howell-Davies has previously called for one pay-TV content company.</p>
<p>Analysts said that if the merger went ahead, future talks between Optus and merged group would be on Murdoch's terms.  </p>
<p>Under terms of the proposed merger, Foxtel will take a 66.5 percent stake in Australis.</p>
<p>The merger would also give the enlarged group the biggest slice of subscribers to Australia's fledgling pay-TV market.</p>
<p>Foxtel currently has about 200,000 subscribers, Australis about 110,000 and Optus about 180,000.</p>
<p>This is the second attempt by Australis and Foxtel to merge.</p>
<p>The first deal was killed off by the ACCC in January 1996 on anti-competitive grounds. ACCC chairman Alan Fels said on Sunday that conditions had changed since then but he stopped short of saying the current proposal would be approved.  </p>
<p>Fels said the industry was now well established whereas it was in a startup stage with the first deal was vetoed.</p>
<p>Analysts said they would be surprised if the ACCC blocked the deal. "I can't really see why they would rule against it," said a Sydney-based telecommunications analyst.</p>
<p>Rationalisation in the industry has long been touted.</p>
<p>The three major players have lost a total of about A$2 billion since 1993 and profits are unlikely for a long time yet.</p>
<p>Analysts said the ACCC has had plenty of time to think about pay-TV merger issues and must have a response already.  </p>
<p>A successful merger could reduce Telstra's exposure to the pay-TV industry and smooth the path for its partial float.</p>
<p>However, this could be complicated by any legal moves by Optus, which is 49 percent owned by Cable &amp; Wireless Plc.</p>
<p>"As far as Optus is concerned, if they don't get their way they are quite happy to tie things up in the courtrooms for the next two years, and that is not going to be in the government's interest," the Melbourne analyst said.</p>
<p>The government plans to raise at least A$8 billion by selling a third of Telstra.  </p>
<p>Analysts said Telstra may eventually exit from the enlarged Foxtel group by selling out to Kerry Packer.</p>
<p>News Corp and Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd reached a deal in June that would give PBL the opportunity to equalise its interests in pay-TV with News Corp.</p>
<p>Australia's pay-TV sector has seen a spate of court room battles involving each industry player, many fought over programming and ownership issues.</p>
