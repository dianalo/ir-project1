<p>Reserve Bank of Australia governor Ian Macfarlane said on Thursday he believed any overstatement of inflation in Australia's official data was a fair bit less than the 1.1 percent estimated as the overstatement in the United States.</p>
<p>"There is a tiny little bit of overstatement, but I doubt that it has implications for monetary policy," he told a parliamentary committee when asked about the level of overstatement in Australia's consumer price index data.  </p>
<p>Macfarlane was asked by former Labor Treasurer Ralph Willis how large the overstatement was in Australia and if it had any implications for monetary policy.</p>
<p>Willis referred to the report on the overstatement of inflation in the United States by Stanford University economist Michael Boskin.</p>
<p>Boskin estimated that the U.S. CPI overstated inflation by 1.1 percent.</p>
<p>Macfarlane said Boskin's 1.1 percent estimate was controversial and many there estimated as lower.  </p>
<p>He said the situation in the United States was different from that in Australia because it did not change its basket of CPI goods as often as Australia.</p>
<p>Macfarlane said any overestimate of inflation would have more implications for fiscal policy, because many benefits are indexed to inflation through the CPI.</p>
