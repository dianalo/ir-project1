<p>Haitian election officials said on Tuesday they would not delay a runoff parliamentary vote, one day after the nation's prime minister resigned alleging vote fraud benefitted an opposition party.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Rosny Smarth announced his resignation on Monday, meaning President Rene Preval will have to name a new prime minister, who in turn will name a new cabinet.</p>
<p>In his resignation speech, Smarth accused the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of fraud in the first round election, on April 6. Only two out of nine Senate seats up for grabs were decided, both going to candidates from the opposition Fanmi Lavalas party of former president Jean-Bertrand Aristide. There are 27 seats in Haiti's Senate.</p>
<p>"It is my position that elections cannot take place with such violations of the law and other incorrect actions," Smarth said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Organisation of American States had also denounced the April 6 voting as flawed. Fewer than 5 percent of voters cast ballots and there were allegations that ballot boxes were stuffed in some districts.</p>
<p>Members of the ruling Lavalas Political Organisation have said they will boycott the runoff vote on Sunday, saying the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) is too sympathetic to Fanmi Lavalas.</p>
<p>"Materials are being distributed as we speak," an offficial of the CEP said on Tuesday, discussing plans to go ahead with Sunday's polling.</p>
<p>Smarth resigned on Monday after months of criticism of his government's failure to address Haiti's grinding poverty and bouts of unrest over government economic policies, notably a plan to privatise state run industries that Aristide opposes.</p>
<p>The privatisation plan was narrowly voted in by parliament last year, but the composition of the senate is important to its implementation. International financial officials say they fear a sweep of senate seats by Fanmi Lavalas would harm it.</p>
<p>Smarth's resignation was considered a success for parliamentarians and the grassroots organisations who have been demanding he quit.</p>
<p>"Those of us who have been fighting for a new political orientation will continue to fight for such reform. It is impossible to support a programme that doesn't correspond with the people's needs," said Deputy Joseph Jasmine.</p>
<p>Government officials said they did not yet know when Preval would name his new prime minister, and could not identify any likely candidates.</p>
