<headline>SOCCER-BALKAN STRIKE FORCE WIN OLD FIRM GAME FOR REAL.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1996-12-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Real Madrid's Balkan strike force of Davor Suker and Predrag Mijatovic shot their side to a 2-0 win over Barcelona in Spain's old firm game on Saturday.</p>
<p>The result leaves Real on 38 points after 16 games, four ahead of Barcelona. With just one league match scheduled before the New Year break, Real are also assured of spending Christmas ahead of their arch-rivals.</p>
<p>A mix-up in the Barcelona defence let Croatian international Suker in midway through the first half, and Montenegrin striker Mijatovic made it 2-0 after fine work by Clarence Seedorf just after the break.</p>
<p>Barcelona fought back strongly but were twice denied by the woodwork on an unusually quiet night for Brazilian striker Ronaldo.</p>
