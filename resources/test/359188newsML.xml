<p>Tokyo stocks ended the Wednesday session down, but well off their lows, as they were unable to recover completely from renewed rumours about the financial health of Nippon Credit Bank Ltd which made the bank sector drop with a thud in the morning, brokers said.</p>
<p>The 225-share Nikkei average finished 128.36 points or 0.70 percent lower at 18,185.97 after falling to a low of 17,901.48. Its March futures shed 160 points to land at 18,180.</p>
<p>"Nippon Credit shares fell below 200 yen to an all-time low which ignited a bank sector sell-off led by futures early in the morning and the sour mood continued throughout the day," said Akishige Ishikura, Dai-ichi Securities analyst.</p>
<p>Brokers added that there was some short-covering and bargain hunting which helped minimise losses whenever the Nikkei benchmark fell through the 18,000 threshold.</p>
