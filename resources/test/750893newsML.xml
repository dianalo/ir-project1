<p>---------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - July 23-----------------</p>
<p>Copper prices are expected to remain under pressure on Wednesday and are likely to head towards support levels if London Metal Exchange (LME) stocks show another sizeable rise, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Against a backdrop of uptrending chart signals and falling inventories, aluminium is expected to probe higher, possibly towards $1,640 a tonne resistance.  </p>
<p>COPPER - With LME inventories fast approaching a total of 200,000 tonnes, traders and analysts suggested that prices might slip further during trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A downside chart close on Tuesday was likely to generate more downside pressure. Harry Creates of Amalgamated Metal Trading was targeting $2,240, while brokers Brandeis pegged the first level of support at the 10-day moving average at around $2,286, followed by $2,250 and $2,226.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the premium of cash over three months eased to a bid of $80 before bouncing to around $100. Last week the spread hit a $270 backwardation.</p>
<p>Spread activity was expected to be a major influence on the forward market.</p>
<p>"If we see any more lending of the nearby spreads then the obvious reaction will be an easing in three month prices," one trader said. "The opposite will also apply," the trader added.</p>
<p>Other traders agreed, saying the market would remain nervous over spreads.</p>
<p>"Until some clear indication emerges on the medium-term movement in the spreads expect choppy and tense trading," another said.</p>
<p>On the upside Creates of AMT saw resistance up to $2,340, which had to be overcome first if trendline resistance at $2,390 was to be challenged.</p>
<p>At 0710 three months copper was indicated at $2,295/$2,300, versus Tuesday's late London close of $2,293/96, while the cash to three months backwardation was hovering around $85.</p>
<p>ALUMINIUM - An upside chart close on Tuesday was likely to aid a rise in aluminium, although any significant downturn in copper would dampen upside sentiment, traders and chartists said.</p>
<p>"With the technical indicators resuming their respective uptrends, look for further strength," Martin Squires of Rudolf Wolff said.</p>
<p>"A confirmed break of $1,620 is sought to target $1,630 and then $1,650," Squires added.</p>
<p>Brokers GNI said that if aluminium broke above resistance between $1,620 and $1,628 prices would target a move to $1,679.</p>
<p>Support was pegged at $1,596 and $1,579, according to Creates.</p>
<p>Brandeis noted that the 10-day moving average was moving higher and was looking to make a bullish cross through the 30-day moving indicator.</p>
<p>At 0710 three months aluminium was indicated at $1,620/22, unchanged.</p>
