<p>President Nursultan Nazarbayev said on Monday Russia should stop griping about a U.S. research plane operating in Kazakhstan because the project was helping to assess the damage caused by secret Soviet-era nuclear tests.</p>
<p>"The plane was invited by us specifically to assess how much land had been spoiled by the activity of the former Semipalatinsk nuclear testing ground," Russia's Interfax news agency quoted Nazarbayev as telling reporters.</p>
<p>"We would like to determine the degree of the catastrophe which has hit Kazakhstan through nuclear tests," he said in the capital Almaty.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan has stopped nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk and shipped to Russia the nuclear arms it had inherited from the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Last week, Russia's Foreign Ministry issued an angry statement saying the Orion P-3 scientific aircraft had spy equipment on board.</p>
<p>"A dangerous precedent of using the territory of one CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) state to spy on other states is being created. We expect that the flights of the U.S. Orion P-3 plane over the territory adjoining the Russian Federation will be stopped without delay," the statement said.</p>
<p>Nazarbayev said he was "amazed" by the Russian reaction and accused Russia of holding back information on Soviet-era nuclear tests in the ex-Soviet state.</p>
<p>"They (Moscow) have given us no information on this," the Kazakh leader said. "They kept it secret up until now and we ourselves do not know on which soil and what kind of economic activities we can carry out at the test sites."</p>
<p>He gave no further details on Russia's apparent reluctance to divulge information on Soviet nuclear tests in the Central Asia state. There was no immediate response from Moscow.</p>
<p>The U.S. embassy last week denied Russian accusations that the Orion would snoop on neighbouring Russian regions.</p>
<p>U.S. officials say the aircraft is carrying out geological research to assess existing resources and environmental damage caused by decades of nuclear tests.</p>
<p>In the 1950s and early 1960s, U.S. spy planes flew over Soviet territory. On May 1, 1960, the Soviets brought down a U.S. U2 spy plane, sparking one of the hottest moments of the Cold War era.</p>
<p>The Orion's scientific flights, which started on June 24, will continue until July 11. The geographical surveys are a joint project involving Kazakhstan's Ministry of Science, the U.S. Department of Energy and a number of U.S. research laboratories.</p>
<p>Nazarbayev, once one of the strongest proponents of the CIS grouping 12 out of 15 former Soviet republics, has been increasingly critical of Russia recently, saying it tries to dominate the CIS.</p>
