<p>Fifty percent discount signs were hung across Lebanon on Saturday signalling the start of a one-month shopping festival aimed at boosting the country's image as a Middle East tourist centre.</p>
<p>Hotels, airlines, restaurants and shops announced a wide range of discounts to run throughout February after the government began a promotional campaign two months ago.</p>
<p>"The idea is to attract as many tourists as possible and to reveal the civilised face of Lebanon and to highlight the return of stability to the country," Minister of Economy Yassin Jaber was quoted as saying in Lebanon's National News Agency.</p>
<p>Tourism flourished in Lebanon before the 1975-1990 civil war, contributing 20 percent of the nation's earnings.</p>
<p>The February "Shopping Month in Lebanon" is mainly expected to attract Gulf Arabs who flocked to Lebanon in pre-war days to enjoy its cool mountains and hot nightlife.</p>
<p>Lebanon's national air carrier Middle East Airlines reduced by up to 50 percent fares on most of its incomming flights.</p>
<p>Director of Sales at the Marriott Hotel Marinette Dorkhom said the festival was an encouraging initiative.</p>
<p>The five-star hotel, which opened last May, is offering the 50 percent discount on its $260, $240 and $380 rooms. The country's other major hotels are also cutting rates by half.</p>
<p>"Most people are coming from the Gulf. Some Europeans who had booked for meetings in other months rescheduled for February", she said.</p>
<p>Discounts offered by shops in Beirut's thoroughfares like Hamra, Mar Elias, Furn el-Shoubbak Zalka range between 30 percent and 50 percent.</p>
