<p>Lebanon's Constitutional Council on Tuesday cited electoral intimidation, bad organisation and cheating as its reasons for cancelling the election of four deputies to parliament last year.</p>
<p>The cancellations, unprecedented in Lebanon's parliamentary history, were hailed as "historic".</p>
<p>However, the court dismissed another 15 appeals against the election results without giving reasons, provoking a statement by one of the nine justices that it should have upheld at least another three appeals by prominent opposition figures defeated in the elections.</p>
<p>Judge Salim Azar was quoted by newspapers as saying the appeals of Maronite Christian nationalist Albert Moukheiber, leftist Habib Saadeq and Druze leftist Issam Naaman should have been sustained.</p>
<p>The Lebanese Association for the Democracy of Elections (LADE), an independent group which monitored last year's voting to the 128-member parliament, also said the appeals of the three opposition politicians should have been upheld.</p>
<p>LADE, which has called the elections the most corrupt in Lebanon's history, said the court's decisions were historic but it should have gone further.</p>
<p>"We consider the decisions an historic first which can be built on in the future....This gives the political class something to think about," LADE director Paul Salem told Reuters.</p>
<p>"On the other hand we regret that in at least three other cases it seems that political influence affected the result. We agree that in those and probably in other cases the results should also have been cancelled," he added.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri said on Monday the decisions bolstered Lebanon's credibility.</p>
<p>The four deposed deputies included Education Minister Fawzi Hobeish whose election was challenged by Maronite Christian opposition politician Mikhael Daher on grounds that Syrian intelligence agencies intervened in the northern Akkar region to intimidate voters in favour of Hobeish.</p>
<p>The other three were Khaled Daher of the Sunni Moslem fundamentalist Jamaa Islamiye movement, Henri Shdeid, a Maronite ally of the Shi'ite fundamentalist Hizbollah (Party of God) and Emile Nawfal, a Maronite independent.</p>
<p>Hobeish told a news conference the court's decisions were "flawed and unjust". He said he would not resign from the ministry and would run in a by-election to fill his vacant seat.</p>
<p>The court said it found "severe breaches" of the election law in three cases, particularly in vote counting procedures. Reports by polling station committees certifying results were unsigned or included unidentified votes, or even failed to give the number of votes, it said.</p>
<p>It criticised the interior ministry, which organised the elections, for "severe breaches and dangerous negligence in organising the electoral reports."</p>
<p>But in the case of Hobeish, the court said it found "extraordinary pressure" was exerted on voters in Akkar.</p>
<p>"Voting took place in a bad atmosphere caused by threats to voters and the arrest of many of them that affected the freedom of voters and their security in voting," the court said.</p>
<p>Daher, the candidate defeated by Hobeish, said in his appeal last September that "the information and security service" -- a coded phrase in Lebanon for Syrian intelligence -- pressured hundreds of local electoral figures to support Hobeish.</p>
<p>Daher, a former minister who ran for the presidency in 1988 and voted against the extension of President Elias Hrawi's mandate in 1995, said Syria issued a ban on his election last year at Hrawi's request.</p>
