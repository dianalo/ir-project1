<p>South Africa's Maize Board said on Wednesday that it would sell maize from its export pools back on to the domestic market at the terms dictated by this season's marketing scheme.</p>
<p>According to the 1995/1996 scheme, maize can be sold to any domestic buyer at a price of import parity price plus 20 rand, Leon du Plessis, the Board's general manager said in a statement.</p>
<p>"(The) Board may sell maize from its export pools on the domestic market, but only at a mimimum price of the landed cost of imported maize at the premises of the buyer concerned plus an additional payment of 20 rand a tonne," du Plessis said.</p>
<p>A maize trader said the import parity price of yellow maize at quayside on Wednesday was 715.17 rand a tonne.</p>
<p>The scheme dictates that all sales be conducted by tender or auction. Du Plessis invited domestic buyers to contact the Board about these options.</p>
<p>Sales from the Board's export pools comes at a time when South African traders are predicting a yellow maize shortfall this season of up to 700,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>The extent of the deficit may, however, be less depending on the how much maize from the Board's pools finds its way back on to the domestic market, traders said.</p>
<p>The Board did not detail the amount or type of maize currently in its pools. It was not immediately available for comment.</p>
