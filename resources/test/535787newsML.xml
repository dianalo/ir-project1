<p>COMSAT Corp said Thursday it is asking the U.S. Federal Communications Commission to remove certain regulations that limit the amount of profit it can make.</p>
<p>The company said it has petitioned to change its FCC status to "non-dominant," which means it would no longer have to abide by FCC regulations that apply to international communications carriers considered dominant players in the market.  The company said the last time the FCC reviewed its carrier status was 12 years ago, when it was the major U.S. provider of satellite communications services.</p>
<p>The company said the petition requests that COMSAT be allowed to change its rates and introduce new services over the INTELSAT system on one-day notice.</p>
<p>The company said the petition also requests that limits on its company's rate of return be removed.</p>
