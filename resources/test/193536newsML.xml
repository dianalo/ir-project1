<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets Friday were extremely slow, with light sales reported at $72.00 per cwt, steady with this week's busy trading, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Sales were reported on 100 slaughter steers and 300 heifers in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area following a weekly movement of 75,300 head, according to USDA.</p>
<p>No sales were reported in Kansas, but 89,000 head were confirmed for the week to date including 17,400 head or about 20 percent  previously contracted or formulated cattle.  </p>
<p>Most of this week's showlist sold including a large number of cattle on feed 85 to 100 days instead of the normal 110 to 120 days, the feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Prices were underpinned by a tight number of cattle on feedlots that graded choice because they have not been on feed long, market sources said.</p>
<p>Feedlot cattle prices also were supported by strong beef demand the past few weeks and expectations for continued strength next week, they said.</p>
