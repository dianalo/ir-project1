<text>
<p>Stock prices fell Monday in the face of rising long-term interest rates, growing fears about strong economic growth, and a case of the nerves ahead of key economic data.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 19.51 points at 8,011.71 after plunging 157 points, or nearly 2 percent Friday, as fresh worries about inflation sent investors running for cover.</p>
<p>In the broader market, declining issues led advances 14-11 on volume of 251 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury was off 9/32, or $2.81 on a $1,000 bond, raising its yield to 6.66 percent from 6.64 percent Friday. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index was down 16.65 points at 1,581.87.</p>
<p>Analysts said financial markets -- still trading at lofty and vulnerable levels despite the recent slide -- had become increasingly worried about vigorous third-quarter growth, which would spell inflation and higher interest rates.</p>
<p>Investors are awaiting July retail sales and price data, due later in the week, to either confirm or allay these jitters.</p>
<p>"People are concerned about the pace of growth in the third quarter," said Charles White, managing director of Avatar Associates. "We won't get any substantial evidence until the retail sales data on Wednesday. Until then, markets should drift with a bias towards heading lower."</p>
<p>July retail sales data, due Wednesday, were forecast to rise 0.7 percent after a 0.ent gain in June. The July producer price index is also set for release Wednesday and the consumer price index is due Thursday.</p>
<p>"The market is waiting for the midweek numbers," said Robert von Pentz, managing partner at Columbia Partners.</p>
<p>With the bond yields pointing to higher interest rates, the stocks of recent high-flying companies trading at rich valuations, such as some in the technology and the drug sectors, were susceptible to profit-taking, analysts said.</p>
<p>"The tech market is getting a bit rattled," said Peter Coolidge, senior equity trader at Brean Murray &amp; Co. "Because they are trading at such high P/Es (price-to-earnings ratios), they are subject to economic swings more than other groups."</p>
<p>He said the Nasdaq market was off more than the Dow because it had climbed faster before Friday's sell-off.</p>
<p>Bellwether technology stock Intel Corp. lost 2-10/16 to 95-3/16, while Microsoft Corp. fell 2-1/2 to 137-1/2.</p>
<p>Drug shares also fell after Morgan Stanley reduced its opinion of the sector. Dow component Merck &amp; Co. lost 3-7/16 to 95-3/8, Warner-Lambert Co. tumbled 6-3/4 to 129-3/8 and Eli Lilly &amp; Co. shed 4-8/16 to 108-5/16.</p>
<p>Ascend Communications Corp. fell 3-11/16 45-3/4, topping the list of most active issues on Nasdaq after Montgomery Securities said it estimated that Ascend's earnings for the first month of the third quarter appeared to be lower than expected.</p>
<p>Reader's Digest Association Inc. gained 3-3/16 to 28-1/16, after the company said its chairman and chief executive, James Schadt, had resigned.</p>
