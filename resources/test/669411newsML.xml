<p>European vegetable oils ended mixed but the palm oil sector firmed on the back of news of a forthcoming tender for palm oils by Egypt.</p>
<p>News that Egypt was to tender for 25,000 tonnes of Malaysian and/or Indonesian palm stearin and palm oil on June 25 for August delivery prompted short-covering.</p>
<p>At the close the palm oils were $5 to $7.50 above Tuesday's finish. During the afternoon palm olein traded Jun at $560 and Aug/Sep at $550.</p>
<p>Soft oils fell back from midday levels as early losses were noted on the Chicago soybean oil futures. At the close they stood mainly 0.25 to 0.75 guilders down.</p>
<p>No trade was reported for soy oil, but rape oil did attract the one trade at 103.25 guilders per 100 kilos for Aug/Oct.</p>
<p>Coconut ended $2.50 to $7.50 lower, with light business ranging from May/Jun at $640 per tonne to $635 for Jul/Aug.</p>
