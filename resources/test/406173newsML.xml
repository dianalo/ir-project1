<p>The Australian share market ended lower on Wednesday, weighed down by soft base metals prices and worries about possible Wall Street weakness later today.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index shed 17.7 points to 2,483.1.</p>
<p>Brokers said losses by the end of the day had extended across the board as investors began to doubt that Wall Street could make it three rises in a row.</p>
<p>"It's almost across the board. The market looks very, very sloppy and the feeling is that Wall Street will be off tonight," said dealer Peter Struk of brokerage Reynolds and Co.</p>
<p>Bellwether BHP was one of the worst hit after the copper price dived. Its shares ended 31 cents lower at A$17.55 (US$13.60).</p>
<p>"All the metals stocks are weaker," Struk said, adding that media giant News Corp had proved a highlight after recovering from some early profit-taking following Tuesday's 5.5 percent rise after announcing its EchoStar deal  DISH.O.</p>
<p>"News Corp actually held up reasonably well. The deal looks terrific and people are obviously responding on that basis."</p>
<p>News Corp shares ended a cent lower at A$7.08.</p>
<p>Others to feature included Perth casino owner-operator, Burswood Property Trust, which topped turnover with 42.28 million units traded, the bulk of it in lines crossed through BZW Australia before the market opened. Brokers said the units appeared to have gone to a range of institutional investors. Its units closed steady at A$1.57.</p>
<p>Other active stocks included brewing group, Foster's Brewing Group, with 20.65 million shares traded, the bulk of it in one line of 18.51 million shares through BT Securities at A$2.70 per share. Its shares closed two cents up at A$2.73 ahead of going ex-dividend five cents on Thursday.</p>
<p>Qantas Airways shares closed five cents lower at A$2.37 in active trade ahead of February series options expiry Thursday and going ex-dividend 6.5 cents today. Total volume was 11.88 million with most of it put through the market in options exercises before trading started.</p>
<p>Petroleum holding company Caltex Australia added 13 cents to A$4.40 on its 36 percent higher year net profit of A$57.7 million while base metals miner Pasminco shares lost a cent to A$2.32 after a steady first half net profit of A$20.2 million.</p>
<p>Falls outnumbered rises by a ratio fo about nine to eight, while about 29 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>(A$1=US$0.77)</p>
