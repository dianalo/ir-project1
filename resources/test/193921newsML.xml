<p>Germany will fail to meet one of the key goals for entry to the European single currency unless it cuts government spending further to reduce its budget deficits, an independent advisory panel warned on Friday.</p>
<p>The Council of Economic Advisers, known popularly as the "Five Wise Men," predicted the total public sector deficit would be 122.5 billion marks ($81.32 billion) in 1997, or about 3.3 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>The economy itself was forecast to expand by 2.5 percent next year, up from 1.5 percent this year.</p>
<p>"We assume there will be more efforts to shrink the deficit, but we don't know how successful they will be," panel chairman Herbert Hax told a news conference.</p>
<p>1997 is the key year for deciding what countries will participate in European economic and monetary union at the start, scheduled for January 1999. Those who wish to join must cut their deficits to three percent of GDP in that year.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the problems many countries were facing in meeting the economic targets for EMU, the panel said a delay in the start of EMU would be a possibility and that this would not spell the end of the project.</p>
<p>The Wise Men report was not the first to offer a gloomy assessment of Germany's ability to meet the targets in full.</p>
<p>The new study also endorsed Germany's call for a strict stability pact to ensure countries maintain prudent fiscal policies after the launch of a single currency.</p>
<p>The panel welcomed Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition's agreement on three billion marks in spending cuts this week, bringing the projected 1997 federal deficit down to 53.3 billion marks from 56.5 billion marks budgeted previously.</p>
<p>But Rolf Peffekoven, another panel member, said Germany would have to find another 11 billion to 12 billion marks in cuts at the federal, state and local levels.</p>
<p>The cuts agreed this week "go in the right direction, but have not yet reached the goal," Peffekoven said.</p>
<p>The panel agreed the deficit could be cut to 3.0 percent of GDP in time if more savings were agreed.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel responded to the report by saying Germany would meet the three percent of GDP deficit goal "with an ample margin of safety."</p>
<p>Waigel said the report, calling for drastic spending cuts and reform of the social welfare state, affirmed government policies and showed the wrongheadedness of the opposition.</p>
<p>But Social Democrat parliamentary economic spokesman Ernst Schwanhold said the panel's expectations for the expansion of trade and the world economy were overly optimistic. "Even at that, the panel is not forecasting a strong economic upturn," in Germany, Schwanhold said.</p>
<p>Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing said, "I rather see this as a warning that we need to continue to work hard." Meeting the deficit target would be a close call, he added.</p>
<p>The panel warned that Germany was caught in a vicious circle of rising state spending, spiralling tax and welfare costs and a shrinking tax base.</p>
<p>"Massive efforts to consolidate state budgets are necessary, to break rigid spending structures and dampen growth in spending," the report said.</p>
<p>"That can only be achieved through a medium-term programme which is firmly implemented, regardless of the economic situation," the report added.</p>
<p>State spending has hit a historic high at over half of GDP, and Germany's pay-as-you-go pension and social security systems will force spending up as the country's average age rises.</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition government has a goal of reducing state spending to 46 percent of GDP by the year 2000. The panel forecast state spending would fall next year to 49.5 percent of GDP from 50.5 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>The Federation of Chambers of Commerce (DIHT) also said the panel's report understated the risks facing the German economy.</p>
<p>The DIHT said the panel's forecast of 2.5 percent economic growth next year was merely a hope, as enterprises have yet to revise their investment plans upward.</p>
<p>The panel also predicted unemployment would remain high and inflation calm at about 1.75 percent. The unemployment rate is likely to average about 11.7 percent, up from an average 11.4 percent this year, it said.</p>
