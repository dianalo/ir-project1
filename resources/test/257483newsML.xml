<p>Malaysia will not incur any more debts to carry out development projects and will adopt a pragmatic approach by ensuring that only vital projects are implemented first, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Many countries had offered to provide loans to Malaysia but the government would not take up the offer because new debt would be a burden to the future generation, he was quoted as saying by the national Bernama news agency.</p>
<p>As such, he said, all matters related to development, especially in the rural areas, would be dealt with in stages.  </p>
<p>Anwar, who is also finance minister, said that just like household expenditure, the government would implement projects according to its financial means.</p>
<p>He added that in the management of the economy, not everything would work out as planned.</p>
<p>"Therefore, when we are criticised over any shortcomings, we will accept them...but they should not merely be to run us down," he said.</p>
<p>Malaysia expects its outstanding external debts to decline to 10.675 billion ringgit at the end of this year from 13.33 billion at end-1995.</p>
