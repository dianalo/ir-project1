<p>Pamplona's world-famous running of the bulls was suspended on Saturday in a show of solidarity for a Basque politician who was shot and seriously wounded by separatist rebels, officials said.</p>
<p>Organisers called off Saturday night's bullfights and the next bull run scheduled for Sunday morning and plan to meet to decide when to restart the festivities, state television said.</p>
<p>It is reported to be the first time since 1978 that the nine-day San Fermin festival has been interrupted.</p>
<p>The decision to suspend the running of the bulls came after 29-year-old Miguel Angel Blanco was found shot in the head near the Basque coastal city of San Sebastian.</p>
<p>The guerrilla group ETA had threatened to execute him by 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) unless the government agreed to change its policy on rebel prisoners.</p>
<p>With Blanco clinging to life, San Fermin organizers decided to halt the festival at least until 9 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Sunday, when they will "evaluate the situation," city officials said.</p>
<p>Announcing the decision from the balcony of Pamplona's city hall, Mayor Javier Chourraut said: "In the face of this criminal act, we have decided to show our sadness and the indignation of our entire society and suspend the scheduled festival activities."</p>
<p>The annual fiesta in Pamplona, which has a large Basque community, draws tens of thousands of bullfighting fans and tourists from across Spain and from around the world.</p>
<p>The most spectacular attraction is each morning's running of the bulls when for several hair-raising minutes hundreds of runners dash through narrow cobblestone streets ahead of six fighting bulls on a winding stretch from the corral to the bullring.</p>
<p>Runners are sometimes gored. The bulls are then killed in the evening's bullfights.</p>
