<text>
<p>NWE gas oil tumbled on Tuesday as falling futures combined with steady to weaker premiums.</p>
<p>March IPE gas oil closed $3.75 a tonne at $163.25 and the contango into April widened to $2 a tonne.</p>
<p>Interest was seen into Germany and France, but the buying demand failed to translate into deals, traders said.</p>
<p>Heating oil barge premiums were unchanged with a prompt Rotterdam refinery barge selling at March IPE flat and a second half barge selling at March IPE -25 cents. FOD cargo premiums were hard to pin down but were notionally pegged around March IPE +$1-2 cif NWE for second half, traders said.</p>
<p>DIN was attracting strong numbers, as high as March IPE +$4.50 cif Germany, but again nothing was heard done. Traders said there was also interest for diesel into Germany.</p>
<p>Diesel premiums were $1-2 easier with a March 20-30 cargo sold at April IPE +$13.75 cif Bordeaux.</p>
