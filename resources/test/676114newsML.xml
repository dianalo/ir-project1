<p>Attorneys representing four major tobacco companies in a lawsuit over secondhand smoke said Friday their clients do not expect the industrywide settlement being negotiated in Washington to wipe out the landmark class action.</p>
<p>David Hardy, an attorney representing Philip Morris Cos. Inc. and Lorillard Tobacco Co. , said Philip Morris had assured him there was nothing in the global settlement talks to stop the case. "I have been told that I am free to tell the court that this case is going forward," he said.</p>
<p>"I have no reason to have any different view of that than Mr. Hardy does," said attorney Hugh Whiting, who represents R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.</p>
<p>Hardy said he knew Lorillard's position was the same as Philip Morris's. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. lawyer Edward Moss said his client also would agree.</p>
<p>The attorneys made their statements as they prepared to resume jury selection in Norma Broin vs. Philip Morris Cos., a lawsuit filed on behalf of thousands of flight attendants who say they were sickened by breathing secondhand cigarette smoke on U.S.-based passenger jets.</p>
<p>The case, filed in 1991, is the first class action and the first secondhand smoke lawsuit to make it to trial. It has been overshadowed since news of the industrywide talks first leaked out in April by concerns that a settlement agreement would mean it would be thrown out of court.</p>
<p>Participants in the talks among tobacco companies, state officials and health care organisations said they hoped to announce an agreement Friday.</p>
<p>By midday Friday, the 12th day of jury selection, attorneys had placed 71 potential jurors in the pool from which they will select a panel of six jurors and 10 alternates. The pool is expected to eventually hold about 100 potential jurors.</p>
<p>The attorneys' statement about the impact of the settlement contradicted precedent set by Liggett Group Inc., a unit of Brooke Group Ltd., which sought a federal court order to shield it from litigation, including the Broin case, after it reached its own settlement with state attorneys general in March.</p>
<p>Liggett, though still listed as a Broin defendant, has maintained it should not be part of the case.</p>
<p>Stanley and Susan Rosenblatt, who say they represent up to 60,000 flight attendants in the class action, Friday repeated their request that Dade County Circuit Judge Rogert Kaye issue an order declaring that a settlement reached between tobacco companies and state officials not affect the Broin case.</p>
<p>The judge did not issue an order. He has previously expressed concerns about the constitutionality of a federal effort to impose an industrywide settlement on a state court. And on Friday he questioned whether he would have jurisdiction to make an order like the one requested.</p>
<p>"Authority is the issue. I just don't know what authority I would have," he said.</p>
<p>The Rosenblatts represent thousands of Florida smokers in another class action, Engle vs. R.J. Reynolds, scheduled to come to trial in September.</p>
<p>They maintain that their two class-action lawsuits are somehow being used by the negotiators involved in the Washington talks as leverage to win concessions from tobacco companies. And they insisted that they expect tobacco companies will seek a federal judge's order to stop the Broin case as soon as a settlement agreement came through, even before it were approved by Congress or the White House.</p>
<p>"What we are very concerned about on behalf of our flight attendant class is that there would be an order entered by a federal judge saying cease and desist," Stanley Rosenblatt said. "We will be in a much stronger position if there is an order entered even before a settlement is announced."</p>
<p>Rosenblatt also staunchly denied a contention raised by Hardy that the Broin and Engle cases are not factors in the tobacco settlement negotiations because the Rosenblatts refused to participate.</p>
<p>"The situation is not that we were invited and we refused," Rosenblatt said. "We were never invited."</p>
