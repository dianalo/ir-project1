<p>Counsel for key players in the Cook Islands Tax Inquiry on Wednesday said that New Zealand Treasurer Winston Peters should be held to account for his allegations of corruption surrounding the so called "winebox" documents.</p>
<p>Lawyers for merchant bank Fay Richwhite and investment company Brierley Investments Ltd told the Commission of Inquiry that action should be taken against Peters following statements to the inquiry by his counsel.</p>
<p>Peters' lawyer Brian Henry said on Tuesday  that the winebox documents contained no evidence that would suggest corruption by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or the Inland Revenue Department (IRD).</p>
<p>Peters had made the allegations in 1994 under parliamentary privilege, which give him immunity from legal action.</p>
<p>Peters, then an independent MP, alleged  that there was a "criminal conspiracy" including Sir Michael Fay and David Richwhite. He said the conspiracy involved secret agreements by IRD and the SFO not to prosecute European Pacific International, which was involved in Cook Island tax deals and in which Fay Richwhite had a stake.</p>
<p>The two-and-a-half-year-old inquiry was called at the insistence of Peters after he tabled leaked documents in the now fabled winebox.</p>
<p>Fay Richwhite's lawyer, Rhys Harrison, told the inquiry that Peters had made "the grossest of allegations".</p>
<p>"His allegations were a lie. Mr Peters must now be held accountable for his own corrupt conduct," Harrison said.</p>
<p>"The damage caused to all those involved, including Sir Michael Fay, David Richwhite and others, is immeasurable."</p>
<p>Peters, who was in Hong Kong for the handover to China, said it was unfortunate the issue had blown up while he was abroad.</p>
<p>However, he said the inquiry's terms of reference were too narrow and that commissioner Sir Ronald Davison himself had acknowledged that.</p>
<p>Davison has complained that the terms of reference only cover whether the SFO and the IRD acted properly on receiving documents contained in the winebox, nothing else.</p>
<p>But the commissioner said on Tuesday that it was time for the "shadow boxing" to end and for Henry to back up Peters' allegations.</p>
<p>"In your opening of Mr Peters' case, you did not give any clear indication whether alleged fraud, conspiracy, corruption, et cetera, existed," Davison said.</p>
<p>"But I'm left with the conclusion that your submissions are full of generalities listing numerous activities by various parties, but do not hone in on the specifics which are necessary if the commission is to reach decisions on issues before it."</p>
<p>The IRD's conclusion was that it could not find evidence of tax evasion, while the SFO said it did not investigate tax matters unless they were referred to it by the IRD.</p>
<p>Henry said the winebox documents contained evidence from which inferences of corruption could be drawn if combined with evidence not considered by the inquiry because it was outside the terms of reference.</p>
<p>However, there was not enough evidence in the winebox alone for the commission to draw that inference, he said.</p>
