<p>A vigorous economy lured a record number of Americans into the labour market last month and put them to work right away at higher pay, stirring visions of inflation and rising interest rates on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Although payroll growth slowed to a smaller-than-expected 175,000 non-farm jobs last month from a hefty 293,000 in February, the unemployment rate edged down to 5.2 percent from 5.3 percent and wages crept upward, the Labour Department said Friday in the government's first look at the economy in March.</p>
<p>"For American workers, it hasn't been this good in decades," said economist Allen Sinai of Boston-based Primark Decision Economics.</p>
<p>Average hourly wages rose 4 percent in the past year, including a 5-cent gain in March, to a seasonally adjusted $12.15, matching the biggest 12-month gain in nearly seven years, the department said.</p>
<p>"Wage inflation is clearly there," said Sinai. "What has not yet been seen is the effect of higher wage costs on consumer price inflation."</p>
<p>The economic numbers rattled inflation-wary financial markets, putting already battered blue chip-stocks on the defensive and sparking a sell-off in the bond market, where prices move in the opposite direction of interest rates.</p>
<p>But stocks rallied in late trading due to bargain-hunting, and the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 48.72 points at 6,526.07 after an initial sell-off drove the blue-chip index down more than 70 points to 6,404.84, below its 1997 start of 6,448.27.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the Treasury's key 30-year bond lost 20/32, or $6.25 on a $1,000 bond, sending its yield up to 7.14 percent from 7.07 percent Thursday.</p>
<p>The economic vitality and labour market tightness reflected in the report convinced many economists that Federal Reserve policymakers will raise short-term interest rates by another quarter percentage point at their next meeting on May 20 and again later, as they did last week.</p>
<p>"It's going to take something close to a tightening of a full percentage point to cool the economy down to a sustainable rate of growth," said economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. in New York.</p>
<p>Shortages of workers in many parts of the country are prompting employers to bid up wages faster than productivity gains, which will raise the price of goods, cut into corporate profit margins, or both, Jones said.</p>
<p>But White House economic adviser Janet Yellen said the past year's wage rise was consistent with productivity gains.</p>
<p>"Labor markets are tight and that bears watching, but I don't see any evidence in today's report of any inflationary pressure there," she said in a CNBC television interview.</p>
<p>President Clinton, vowing to press for a balanced budget agreement this year, said a jobless rate of 5 percent or less is possible without inflation "if we do it with discipline."</p>
<p>The department's household survey showed that people, including those who had previously given up looking for work, were swarming into the labour market and quickly finding jobs.</p>
<p>The civilian labour force, which includes all job holders and job seekers, rose by 685,000 to 136.3 million, while the number of job holders surged by 745,000 to 129.18 million. The number of unemployed workers fell by 61,000 to 7.14 million.</p>
<p>That raised the proportion of the non-institutionalized working age propulation with jobs to an all-time high 63.8 percent and the labour force participation rate to a record high 67.3 percent, the department said.</p>
<p>Economist Russell Sheldon of Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh said last year's welfare reform law may be helping to provide some of the new entrants into the labour force.</p>
<p>"Even that huge influx of people is not enough," he said. "We're probably getting close to the point where it's going to be hard to find 200,000 new workers a month."</p>
<p>The March payrolls increase, which lagged the 225,000 average rise of the past 12 months, was almost entirely in private service industries, which added 187,000 jobs, the department said.</p>
<p>Job growth included 58,000 in business services, including 25,000 temporary help jobs, as well as 22,000 in health services and 43,000 in retailing, it said. The number of government jobs fell by 19,000 last month.</p>
<p>The manufacturing sector added 16,000 jobs in March, bringing its growth since last September to 74,000, it said.</p>
<p>Factory overtime rose by 12 mintues to 4.9 hours per week, the highest level since recordkeeping began 41 years ago. The factory workweek also rose by 12 minutes to 42.1 hours.</p>
<p>The volatile construction industry, which added 108,000 jobs in February, lost 27,000 jobs last month, reflecting unusual winter weather patterns, according to Katharine Abraham, commissioner of the department's Bureau of Labour Statistics.</p>
