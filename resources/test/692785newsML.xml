<headline>India's PM urges separate air corridors for safety.</headline>
<dateline>NEW DELHI 1997-06-27</dateline>

<p>Indian Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral asked aviation officials to create separate corridors for ascending and descending aircraft at New Delhi airport to ease traffic, the Press Trust of India (PTI) said on Friday.</p>
<p>Gujral's decision followed flight safety concerns after last Sunday's near-miss between a Tarom Romanian airline Airbus 310 and a Gulf Air Boeing 767 some 44 nautical miles southwest of the Indian capital, PTI reported.</p>
<p>The two planes had about 370 passengers on board.</p>
<p>Indian authorities said it was the eleventh case of a near-miss over India since last November when a Saudi Arabia Airlines Boeing 747 and a Kazakh Ilyushin Il-76 freighter collided in mid-air near New Delhi, killing all 349 people aboard.</p>
<p>The world's worst mid-air collision had focused world attention on flight safety in India, where economic growth has spurred tourism, placing pressure on outdated air traffic systems.</p>
<p>Ten senior pilots on a safety panel had recommended two separate air lanes for climbing and descending aircraft. Delhi currently has only one corridor for all aircraft.</p>
<p>A multi-million dollar plan to modernise radar and communications systems at major airports has also fallen far behind schedule for technical reasons, officials say.</p>
<p>PTI said the new radar and communications system would be installed in the next couple of months.</p>
