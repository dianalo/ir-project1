<p>Would whoever invited retired Russian general Alexander Lebed to President Bill Clinton's inaugural swearing-in ceremony please step forward?</p>
<p>The tough-talking Lebed, rival to Russian President Boris Yeltsin, says he is coming to the inauguration on Monday at Clinton's invitation. "I am invited by the president," he told Russia's NTV commercial television.</p>
<p>But White House spokesman Mike McCurry said on Thursday: "I don't know how he got a ticket. He was not invited by the United States."</p>
<p>Lebed has been touting himself as a potential successor to the ailing Yeltsin, leading the pro-Yeltsin U.S. government to keep him at arms length.</p>
<p>McCurry suggested Lebed was a guest of the Joint Inaugural Committee, made up of leaders of Congress.</p>
<p>Not so, said committee spokesman Eric Ruff, who was hit with a flood of media phone calls about Lebed. He said it was unclear who invited Lebed.</p>
<p>"We didn't invite him," Ruff said. "The Joint Inaugural Committee didn't invite him. That doesn't preclude a member of Congress from giving him a ticket or a group of tickets to someone who might give a ticket to Mr. Lebed."</p>
<p>All 535 members of Congress are allotted tickets for Monday's inaugural ceremony.</p>
<p>"If he's been invited, as he apparently has been, it came from an allotment from an individual member of Congress," another White House spokesman, Barry Toiv, said.</p>
<p>What does the White House think about that?</p>
<p>"The president will not be embarrassed and would not be offended by Gen. Lebed's presence," McCurry said. "It would strike him as curious, but he is not in control of the people who are awarded tickets to the swearing-in ceremony."</p>
<p>He said Russia's official invited guest is Russia's ambassador to Washington, Yuli Vorontsov. But he said that since Lebed is a significant figure in Russian politics, the State Department might have some contact with him if he comes.</p>
