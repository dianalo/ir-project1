<headline>DM Grenfell cuts Mexico in LatAm stock portfolio.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- Deutsche Morgan Grenfell said on Thursday it had downgraded Mexico to short-term underweight from neutral in its model Latin American stock portfolio.</p>
<p>-- The downgrade was prompted by "politcal turbulence, the volatile fixed-income market and present valuations," the company said in a report.  </p>
<p>-- Mexico was reduced to 24 from 28 percent in the portfolio.  Brazil was raised by three percentage points and Argentina by one.</p>
<p>-- "While maintaining our fundamental recommendations, investors could take profits" in Coca-Cola FEMSA ; Far-Ben, or Bevides; and Grupo Continental, or Contal, it said.</p>
