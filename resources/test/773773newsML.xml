<p>Britain's leading share index has a lot to  swallow next week if it wants to crack 5,000 points for the first  time.</p>
<p>Topping the list are the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee  (MPC) meeting on Wednesday and Thursday and earnings results from  17 companies in the FTSE 100, a total weighting of 27 percent of the  index.</p>
<p>Sterling's perch above 3.0 German marks and a steep Wall Street sell-off  early on Friday, after robust U.S. employment data, may also dampen  investors' appetites, analysts said.</p>
<p>"I don't think we will get to 5,000 unless there is no rate hike from  the Bank of England, showing the concern is far more with the export  sector and a slowdown in economic growth this year and next," said  Robert Kerr, equities strategist at Nikko Europe.</p>
<p>A Reuters poll showed 16 of 23 London-based economists expected base  rates to rise by 25 basis points to 7.0 percent.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 on Friday closed 8.2 points lower at 4,899.3, up 36.7  points or 0.7 percent on the week. The index's all-time intra-day  best of 4,998.1 was hit July 18.</p>
<p>The Dow was down over 100 points or 1.3 percent  following the London  market close after the U.S. Labor Department said the jobless rate  fell to 4.8 percent in July and non-farm payrolls swelled by 316,000,  well above the consensus forecast of 193,000.</p>
<p>"I would suspect that in advance of the (UK monetary policy) meeting  the market would be a little bit hesitant," said Richard Jeffrey,  strategist at brokerage Charterhouse Tilney.</p>
<p>"There is a strong two-way pull on opinion as to where UK interest  rates are headed in the short term, though most agree that in the  long-term rates are going up."</p>
<p>Further evidence of slowing growth in Britain's sluggish manufacturing  sector, in stark contrast to the lively services sector, sharpened  the rate issue.</p>
<p>The July purchasing managers survey on Friday showed the manufacturing  economy expanded for the 14th month in succession, but the pace of  growth eased slightly as export orders fell for the first time since  January 1996.</p>
<p>The rampant pound, up around 25 percent on a trade-weighted basis  since last August, is punishing British manufacturers and engineering  firms.</p>
<p>Underlining that concern, analysts said GKN Plc, reporting next Wednesday,  is expected to receive a bigger sting from sterling than it has previously  estimated.</p>
<p>Bank stocks such as HSBC Holdings, which reports on Monday, and Lloyds  TSB, whose shares jumped 10 percent early Friday, will also set the  tone.</p>
<p>British Airways and Pearson Plc also report on Monday, followed by  BAA Plc and British Petroleum Plc on Tuesday. BP and Royal Dutch/Shell  Group, on Thursday, each have a 5.5 pct weighting in the FTSE 100.</p>
<p>Cushioning a FTSE 100 sell-off may be the investment institutions'  underweight positions in some of this year's top performing shares,  traders said.</p>
<p>British institutions would have to spend 40 billion stg to correct  that imbalance and avoid the risk of further underperformance in the  likes of HSBC and SmithKline Beecham Plc, Schroders said in a study  released on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The scale of buying required to neutralise this position is massive,"  the study said. "There is an argument that 'chasing' these stocks  after a period of outperformance is the wrong thing to do, although  having done fundamental work on why big stocks are outpacing smaller  stocks we would disagree."</p>
