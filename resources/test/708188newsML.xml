<headline>DASA upbeat on Eurofighter financing talks.</headline>

<p>Manfred Bischoff, chief executive of Daimer-Benz Aerospace AG (DASA), said on Friday that talks on completing financing for Germany's planned order of Eurofighter combat aircraft were going well.</p>
<p>Bischoff told Reuters the talks were "very constructive and positive" and that he was relatively optimistic of wrapping up a deal in the next few days.  </p>
<p>Bischoff declined to go into details of the talks, in which Finance Minister Theo Waigel is seeking to claw back early around one billion marks in prefinancing granted to DASA for its Airbus civilian aircraft operations.</p>
<p>Closing the gap would help Germany place the 23 billion mark order for the 180 Eurofighters it wants to modernise its airforce.</p>
<p>Bischoff said he was sure Bonn would make a firm commitment to the project, adding: "I can't imagine that Germany can take any other decision, bearing in mind the state of the technical devlopment and level of European involvement."</p>
<p>Germany's Eurofighter partners -- Britain, Spain and Italy -- have been concerned by the fact Bonn has not yet placed a firm order for the aircraft.</p>
<p>Both Waigel and Defence Minister Volker Ruehe have backed the project but have said they still need more talks to hammer out a deal on financing.</p>
<p>A final decision is expected to be taken by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet when they meet to agree on next year's defence budget on July 11.</p>
