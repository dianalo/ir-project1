<p>The European Court of Human Rights on Monday upheld a British ban on an erotic film about the visions of a 16th-century Spanish nun, rejecting charges that it violated the director's freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The judges ruled by seven to two that Britain's 1989 ban on the 18-minute "Visions of Ecstasy" about the Roman Catholic mystic Saint Teresa of Avila did not breach the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p>The court agreed such censorship was justified under blasphemy laws to avoid shocking Christians. The film's director, Nigel Wingrove, argued that the ban violated his freedom of expression.</p>
<p>The judges reached the decision after more than a year's deliberations, including viewing the film that includes sex scenes between the heroine and an actor representing Jesus Christ and a woman in a lesbian scene.</p>
<p>The ruling was a rare victory for Britain, which is often at odds with the court, a branch of the 40-nation Council of Europe in Strasbourg, eastern France.</p>
<p>The European Commission of Human Rights, which vets cases for the court, angered London in September by agreeing to take up the case of a British 12-year-old boy seeking to overturn British laws allowing his parents to smack him.</p>
<p>Last year the court condemned Britain for the killings of three unarmed Irish Republican Army bombers in Gibraltar in 1988. And this year it condemned Britain's system for jailing minors.</p>
<p>Monday's ruling differed from the Commission, whose experts voted by 14 to two in a non-binding opinion in 1995 that the ban on "Visions of Ecstasy" violated freedom of expression. Most court rulings match those by the commission.</p>
