<p>CBOT July soymeal futures ended limit down on Wednesday, pressured by confirmation that a U.S. firm is importing soybeans from Brazil, floor traders said.</p>
<p>"Cargill has contracted to import soybeans from Brazil for use in our processing plants in the southeastern United States, where the (soybean) shortage is particularly acute," the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The import news also caused limit-down losses in July soybeans and knocked soyoil futures to sharply lower closes, traders said.</p>
<p>The Brazilian processor Ceval Ailmentos also confirmed on Wednesday that it was in talks to sell 40,000 tonnes of soymeal to an unnamed buyer in the U.S.</p>
<p>Market sources said that the Brazilian meal was purchased by an East Coast hog producer.</p>
<p>The pool of unfilled sell orders in July soymeal was estimated at 150 to 300 lots, pit traders said.</p>
<p>CBOT soymeal futures ended $0.20 to $10.00 per ton lower, with July down $10.00 at $273.10 a ton. Soyoil settled 0.55 to 0.30 cent per lb lower, with July down 0.51 at 23.34 cents.</p>
