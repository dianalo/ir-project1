<p>The U.S. stock market could rise further near-term, with limited upside potential, before the economy loses its balance and causes stocks to pull back, two prominent Chicago economists said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's (S&amp;P) 500 index could rise to near 780 at the end of next year, only slightly above its current 745 level, James Annable, chief economist, First Chicago NBD Corp, told an investor relations group here.</p>
<p>The index, which he said in the last month has become "very, very frothy relative to fundamentals," is about 10 percent overvalued.  </p>
<p>Although that amount of overextension is not unusual, Annable said "you really don't want" the market to continue advancing at its recent clip.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Dow 30 Industrials reasonably could rise another 1,600 points to the 8,000 area before it becomes sorely overvalued, said Robert Dederick, economic consultant, Northern Trust Co.</p>
<p>"Now I'm saying that one of these days the Dow is going to break (above) 8,000 -- not right off, but one of these days," Dederick said. "It's not a great big overvalued market, but one of these days it will be."  </p>
<p>Both economists said the key to the stock market and corporate profits is whether the current "Goldilocks" economy -- "not too hot, not too cold" -- can persist.</p>
<p>"The key to what's happening today is inflation," said Annable. "Despite the low unemployment rate...inflation hasn't picked up. As long as we can hold on to that, then this Goldilocks economy can continue."</p>
<p>Dederick said the economy, which is walking a "tightrope," already is growing more slowly. But until the stock market draws in full-blown speculative buying that ignores signs of an economic deterioration, it still has some more upside.  </p>
<p>"The Goldilocks economy is going to turn out to be the stressed-out economy several years down the road," Dederick added.</p>
<p>Annable also said he saw a structural change in fundamentals that makes it harder to forecast performance but that explains why low unemployment, low inflation and high corporate profits have been able to co-exist for so long.</p>
<p>He noted that corporate downsizing has occurred in the last couple of years despite strong earnings -- unprecedented behavior that has made corporations more efficient.</p>
<p>"In the past what's happened is it's (downsizing) gone on when firms are in trouble," Annable said. "This is the first time in history that it's been going on on a broad scale when profits are strong." ((--Chicago Newsdesk (312) 408-8787))</p>
