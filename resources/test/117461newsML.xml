<p>Most of the U.S. Corn Belt should remain warm and dry through Thursday, before a system bringing colder and wetter weather settles in by Friday, private forecasters said.</p>
<p>"Today (Tuesday) and tomorrow (Wednesday) should be real nice days across most of the Corn Belt," said Craig Solberg with Weather Trades, Inc.</p>
<p>A weak front stretching from Wisconsin to Kansas was also seen bringing trace amounts of rain to some hard red winter wheat areas Tuesday and Wednesday, said Fred Gesser, chief meteorologist with Weather Express in Omaha, Nebraska.  </p>
<p>The system, seen bringing cooler, wetter weather was expected to move west to east and produce rainfall amounts ranging from 0.25 to 1.25 inch with 65 percent coverage of the Corn Belt, according to the latest forecast from Jon Davis, meteorologist with Smith Barney brokerage.</p>
<p>High temperatures by Friday could dip into the 50s (degrees Fahrenheit) and low temperatures could drop into the 20s and 30s F, forecasters said.</p>
<p>Next week, the Corn Belt is expected to see normal to below normal temperatures and normal to slightly below-normal precipitation, Solberg said.</p>
<p>"Overall, next week's forecasts aren't ones that should make harvest activity grind to a halt," Solberg said.</p>
