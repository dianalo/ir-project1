<p>COMEX copper futures were called to open lower Wednesday in line with LME copper prices.</p>
<p>Traders looked for more profit taking on the latest leg of a rally which took nearby copper to an eight-month high last week.</p>
<p>COMEX July copper was called down 0.20 to 0.50 cent from Tuesday's close of 117.10 cents a lb.</p>
<p>But July copper's five-day moving average remains above its 21- and 55-day averages, analysts noted, suggesting the long uptrend remained intact.</p>
<p>LME warehouse copper stocks rose just 50 tonnes to 132,550 tonnes in Wednesday's data, while COMEX copper stocks fell 237 short tons Tuesday to 42,395 short tons.</p>
<p>Since the start of May, LME copper stocks have fallen from 145,750 tonnes to 132,500 tonnes Tuesday, while COMEX inventories have dropped to 42,632 short tons Monday, from 49,520 at the beginning of May.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, workers at Inco Ltd in Ontario, Canada, remained on strike at the company's nickel and copper mine at Sudbury and the refinery in Port Colborne, but the company said customers would not be affected.</p>
<p>The Ontario division produces about 90,000 tonnes of copper, most of which is supplied to the U.S. North East market.</p>
