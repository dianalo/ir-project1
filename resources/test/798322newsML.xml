<p>Fleet Financial Group Inc has agreed to buy privately held mutual fund company Columbia Management for between $500 million and $600 million in cash, USA Today reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>Officials from both Fleet and Columbia Management, which is based in Portland, Ore, were not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>Both companies declined to comment Tuesday, USA Today reported.</p>
<p>The paper also said Fleet's board approved the deal -- which may be announced today -- earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Columbia has $22 billion in assets under management, the paper said, putting Fleet's purchase price just under 3 percent of those assets.</p>
<p>The acquisition would propel Fleet from 62nd to about 40th in the asset manegement industry, the paper said, citing Pensions &amp; Investments magazine. It would also double the size of the company's asset manegement arm -- Fleet Investment Advisors -- which oversees about $50 billion in assets.</p>
<p>The acquisition would also be in line with Fleet's plan to expand beyond its traditional core-lending business, the paper said.</p>
