<p>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co said Tuesday its net earnings for the second quarter were $0.74 per share, matching Wall Street expectations as worldwide pharmaceutical sales jumped 18 percent over the same period of 1996.</p>
<p>The second quarter earnings per share represented a 14 percent increase over the 1996 quarter on solid sales growth in key prescription drugs.  </p>
<p>Bristol-Myers cited net sales of $4.06 billion for the 1997 second quarter ending June 30, up 10 percent from the 1996 quarter including adjustments for a three-percent negative foreign exchange effect in the recent period.</p>
<p>Domestic sales increased 15 percent and international sales increased four percent including the foreign exchange drag -- with no changes ascribed to pricing activity.</p>
<p>"Our strong growth continued in the second quarter, with pharmaceutical, consumer medicines and beauty care sales volume increasing at robust double digit rates," said chief executive Charles Heimbold Jr.  </p>
<p>"These results demonstrate that we intend to be competitive in our core product categories," he said.</p>
<p>The New Jersey-based drugmaker said domestic pharmaceutical sales increased 26 percent and international sales increased nine percent, excluding foreign exchange, in the recent quarter.</p>
<p>Sales of anti-cholesterol drug Pravachol, the company's largest selling product, increased 21 percent to $307 million. And Taxol, its leading anti-cancer drug, saw sales grow 13 percent to $225 million, Bristol-Myers said.  </p>
<p>Sales of Glucophage for non-insulin dependent diabetes, vaulted 93 percent to $145 million during the 1997 quarter.</p>
<p>But in the consumer medicines group, sales growth of 12 percent was trimmed to three percent by the negative foreign exchange factor, the company said.</p>
<p>Analgesic products enjoyed volume growth of Excedrin, Efferalgan and Dafalgan, Bristol-Myers said.</p>
<p>Beauty care sales increased 17 percent, including the foreign exchange factor, during the 1997 quarter -- with hair care products increasing 25 percent due to performance of HerbalEssences and Infusium 23.  </p>
<p>For the second quarter, nutritional sales increased one percent and medical device sales decreased two percent, including foreign exhange factors.</p>
<p>For the six months of 1997, sales increased 10 percent to $8.1 billion with domestic sales increasing 13 percent and international sales increasing seven percent, adjusting for the currency effect.</p>
<p>The effective income tax rate on earnings before income taxes was 28.5 percent compared to 29 percent in the first half of 1996 as a result of higher earnings in lower tax jurisdictions, Bristol-Myers said.</p>
