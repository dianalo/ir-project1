<p>A "controlled delay" of European economic and monetary union (EMU) would be preferable to launching a weak single currency as planned in 1999, a German economic expert said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"It should not be necessary to have the euro rammed through without regard for the stability criteria," Adrian Ottnard, an economist at Bonn's Institute for Economy and Commerce (IWG), told German Radio in Berlin.</p>
<p>If the criteria outlined in the Maastricht Treaty cannot be met on time, Ottnard said he "would give preference to a controlled delay over a very soft and loose currency".</p>
<p>Ottnard's remarks followed a similar comments by Bavarian premier Edmund Stoiber, who earlier this week called for a controlled delay of EMU if strict fiscal criteria cannot be met.</p>
<p>Ottnard also said German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was wrong to maintain that a delay could damage the chances of ever launching a single currency.</p>
<p>If Germany and France fail to meet the fiscal requirements this year, it would also be possible to introduce the single currency later, he said. -- Bonn Newsroom, +49-228 26097150</p>
