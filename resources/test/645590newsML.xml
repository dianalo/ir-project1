<p>American Gigi Fernandez and Natasha Zvereva of Belarus claimed their fifth French Open doubles title in six years on Sunday, brushing aside Mary Joe Fernandez and Lisa Raymond 6-2 6-3.</p>
<p>Gigi Fernandez, who won Olympic gold in 1992 and 1996 for the United States with Mary Joe Fernandez, teamed up with long-time partner Zvereva, the world's top-ranked doubles player, to crush the fifth-seeded all-American pairing.</p>
<p>Mary Joe Fernandez, no relation, had ended Gigi and Zvereva's four-year reign when she and Lindsay Davenport steamrollered past the world's top ranked doubles team 6-2 6-1 in last year's final.</p>
<p>"I learned from last year," said Gigi Fernandez. "We got to the finals and played a team that we weren't expecting to get there.</p>
<p>"We were ready this time, we weren't going to make the same mistake."</p>
<p>One of the most successful doubles pairing of all time, having now won 11 grand slam titles together, Zvereva and Fernandez decided to take a break from each other at the end of last season.</p>
<p>Without her regular sidekick, Zvereva had already won four tournaments with three different partners before arriving at Roland Garros.</p>
<p>An injury to Meredith McGrath, who was to partner the Belarussian this season, brought the pair back together, probably for the remainder of the season.</p>
<p>There was an upset in the mixed doubles final on Saturday as 16th seeds Rika Hiraki of Japan and Mahesh Bhupathi of India beat top seeds Raymond and Patrick Galbraith of the United States 6-4 6-1.</p>
