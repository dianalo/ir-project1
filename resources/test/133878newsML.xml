<p>The District of Columbia told investors in a recent general obligation bond offering that an SEC probe launched in February 1995 of city bonds continues despite being groundless.</p>
<p>"The District does not believe that it violated the federal securities laws in connection with such offerings," the city said in the preliminary Official Statement for the $168.87 million of GO bonds sold October 3.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the investigation launched February 9, 1995 "is ongoing," the District said in the document.</p>
<p>"The District cannot, at this time, predict what action, if any, the SEC will take as a result of the investigation or what impact, if any, the investigation may have on the District or its securities," the POS says.</p>
<p>Daniel Rezneck, general counsel for District's five-member control board told D.C. lawyers October 9 that the SEC's probe continues and probably has been expanded to cover city financial statements for fiscal year 1995.</p>
<p>"The District sold a large amount of bonds in" late 1994, Rezneck said. "The result was an SEC investigation of the District which is still ongoing."</p>
<p>Rezneck added that D.C. auditor KPMG Peat Marwick in January highlighted deficiencies in D.C.'s financial statements for FY 1995. Thos recent findings are "undoubtedly part of SEC's investigation," Rezneck said.</p>
<p>D.C.'s lawyer Gerald Laporte, an attorney with the lawfirm Patton Boggs, said he had no comment on the investigation.</p>
<p>Washington sources say SEC is examining the quality of D.C.'s disclosure in the December 1994 notes sale, among other matters.</p>
<p>When the 1994 notes were sold through a syndicate led by Prudential Securities Inc. bond documents put D.C.'s budget deficit at $492 million. Six weeks later, however, city officials estimated it at roughly $722 million.</p>
<p>Rezneck told lawyers at the October 9 D.C. bar meeting that SEC probably would not be investigating the city as enthusiastically if D.C. were not at its doorstep.</p>
