<p>Dansk Olie og Naturgas (Dong) and Amerada Hess are considering connecting a Danish pipeline to the Europipe II trunkline to supply Norwegian gas to Danish customers, Statoil's Status Weekly newsletter said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Europipe II is due to cross the Danish continental shelf on its route from the gas treatment plant at Kaarstoe on the southwest coast of Norway to Emden in northern Germany.</p>
<p>"The Danish solution involves gathering production from several of the country's small discoveries at South Arne, southwest of Norway's Ekofisk field," Statoil said.</p>
<p>Dong and Amerada Hess were considering construction of a line able to carry about seven billion cubic metres per year of gas from South Arne to Nybro on the west coast of Jutland.</p>
<p>Denmark's remaining North Sea gas reserves will be insufficient to meet demand from Dong customers within three or four years. The company had therefore begun negotiations with Norwegian supplier, Statoil said.</p>
<p>As operator of Europipe II, Statoil has previously said it was considering piping gas to Denmark through the line. One option involves a T-junction on the trunkline for a spur to the city of Nybro in western Denmark. Another option is to lay the main line via Nybro.</p>
