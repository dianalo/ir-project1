<p>London Metal Exchange (LME) copper prices looked to establish a foothold above $2,000 a tonne by the close of business on Monday, though profit-taking and speculative selling was emerging to cap the move.</p>
<p>Benchmark three months copper was last at $2,012, down $3 from its high, but up on Friday's LME kerb close of $2,007.</p>
<p>Traders said the market continues to consolidate ahead of Tuesday's LME stocks which are expected to fall. Currently inventories stand at six-year lows of 113,400 tonnes.</p>
<p>On the charts resistance is pegged at $2,040, while support was expected to emerge at $1,985.  </p>
<p>Tight nearby spreads continued to buoy copper. The cash to three months backwardation was little changed at $75.</p>
<p>News that a strike at Chile's Candelaria copper mine had ended after six days failed to impact seriously on prices, as production at the 150,000 tonne facility had not been affected.</p>
<p>Aluminium after testing support below $1,450 snapped back to close at $1,448, though this was still $2 down on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said aluminium is now likely to trend sideways, though a stocks rise on Tuesday may prompt selling.</p>
<p>A 96,000 tonne fall in total IPAI stocks in September to four-year lows of 3.257 million tonnes failed to impact.  </p>
<p>Nickel, after an earlier chase lower with copper to $7,170, recovered some of its poise to end at $7,200, a loss of $60.</p>
<p>Zinc also recovered earlier lost ground following sell-stop activity down to $1,051. It was last at $1,060, down $4.</p>
<p>Lead was $3 lower at $732. Tin was indicated $5,915/25, versus $5,925.</p>
<p>Alloy settled at $1,295/98, against $1,300/05.</p>
