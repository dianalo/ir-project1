<text>
<p>-- Salomon Brothers said it upgraded Mazel Stores Inc to strong buy from buy after Mazel's announcement early today that it expected to miss first quarter estimates.</p>
<p>-- Kept 1997 earnings estimate at $1.05 per share.</p>
<p>-- In research note, analyst David Childe said there are "many reasons to believe Q1 results will be anomalous."</p>
<p>-- Said expects $15-16 per share price near-term, moving to low $20's further on "if comps continue strong and the wholesale business picks up in the next couple of months."</p>
<p>-- Shares rose one to 13-5/8. The shares fell sharply last Friday ahead of Mazel's conference call to discuss Q1 outlook.</p>
