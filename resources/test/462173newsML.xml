<p>Hong Kong stocks are languishing at their lowest levels this year following a period of consolidation from mid-January peaks but analysts said prices should regain lost ground before Hong Kong returns to China.</p>
<p>An average of eight forecasts collected in a Reuters survey showed the Hang Seng Index at a record high of 14,250 points by the time Britain hands Hong Kong back to China on midnight of June 30. The blue chip barometer hit an all-time intra-day high of 14,004.93 on January 16. It closed at 12,489.30 on Friday.</p>
<p>"The handover in itself will be perceived positively in terms of the evidence of a smooth transition becoming more plausible and more evident," said Andrew Fernow, director of research at Vickers Ballas.</p>
<p>"That coupled with the fact that the economic conditions in China and Hong Kong are improving and the earnings cycle has clearly swung up tells me that people are going to be bullish around that time of the year," he said.</p>
<p>There are just 100 days to go until the handover and investors generally expect the transition of power to be smooth.</p>
<p>Hong Kong should benefit from further economic integration with China and liquidity flows from the mainland into the Hong Kong property and stock markets, analysts said. "A steady pickup in the Chinese economy, accompanied by gradual loosening of credit, will have positive implications for Hong Kong," Goldman Sachs said in a March/April strategy report.</p>
<p>"We expect mainland entities to become more active and the market to enjoy a further upward rerating, which should bring the Hang Seng Index to near the 15,800 level in about 12 months," it added.</p>
<p>But Janice Wallace, executive director at Goldman Sachs, said the handover was only likely to have an impact during the second half of the year, and interest rate worries would push the Hang Seng Index down to 12,000 points by the end of June.</p>
<p>Concerns about higher interest rates and fears of a correction in Hong Kong's soaring property market have brought the index down from its highs. But analysts said once investors get a clearer picture of the interest rate outlook, the focus would return to positive local fundamentals.</p>
<p>Alex Tang, head of research at Yamaichi International, also said the Hong Kong government was unlikely to prompt a fall in property prices by intervening to cool down the market and those fears should subside. "I don't think the government is going to do anything now in this period of transition," he said.</p>
<p>With earnings growth of 15 percent expected this year from Hong Kong's blue chip companies, Dharmala Securities director of research Ben Kwong said stocks currently offered value.</p>
<p>"I think Hong Kong shares are really attractive. They are trading at about 12.5 times 1997 earnings," he said.</p>
<p>But after rising to new records, Kwong saw the Hang Seng Index declining during the second half of the year.</p>
<p>"I think 1997 will be a peak year for Hong Kong shares because the market is discounting that the Hong Kong and Chinese economies are going to pick up in momentum," he said.</p>
<p>Kwong said investors would then have to watch the interest rate trend and possible overheating of the Hong Kong and Chinese economies in 1998.</p>
<p>"After the handover, the market will cool down a bit," added Ricky Tam, research manager at Delta Asia Securities.</p>
<p>The following are analysts' forecasts for the Hang Seng at the end of June, the end of September and the end of 1997.</p>
