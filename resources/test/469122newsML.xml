<p>The Mexican peso could bear the brunt of the current U.S. interest rate moves, Morgan Stanley economist Ernest "Chip" Brown said in a report.</p>
<p>"The Mexican peso, strong again after weakening at the start of the month, will likely bear the brunt of the current move, and may yet make our 8 (pesos per dollar) end March forecast, although we won't be holding our breath waiting for it," Brown said.  </p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said, however, that circumstances differ widely from February 1994, when the U.S. Federal Reserve started a series of interest rate hikes that hit hard at Mexico and at other emerging markets.</p>
<p>In 1994, Mexican banks were gearing up for a year of new lending, and growing problem loan portfolios were going unrecognized. There was also a rebel uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, which stirred investors' unease.</p>
<p>"In 1997, another election year in which, once again nominal (interest) rates are expected to fall, there are major differences," Brown said.  </p>
<p>"Real rates are likely to remain unchanged, no significant loosening of credit by the central bank is likely, nor is seemingly priced into asset prices," he said.</p>
<p>Foreign ownership of local treasury bills is steady at no more than one-third of the total, compared to the case in 1994 when foreigners held nearly all treasury bills, known locally as Cetes, he noted.</p>
<p>The U.S. Federal Reserve raised the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 5.5 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley said it was concerned about whether investors understood this will be the start of a process that could lift the federal funds rate to 6.5 percent by year's end.</p>
<p>"If so, then Mexico's story is going to be dominated, as it should be, by the local (mid-term) election imponderables and the recovery of the macroeconomy, which (this year at least) should not be strongly helped by the local credit story, regardless fo what happens to U.S. rates," Brown said.</p>
<p>The lion's share of Mexico's mid-term elections will be held on July 6, when voters will choose all the members the lower house of Congress, part of the Senate as well as the mayor of Mexico City and several state governors.</p>
