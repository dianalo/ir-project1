<p>Kuwait told OPEC it produced 2.008 million barrels per day (bpd) in September, roughly in line with its 2.0 million bpd quota, the OPEC News Agency (OPECNA) said on Monday.</p>
<p>Kuwait did not provide a market supply figure. OPEC quotas are determined according to market supply and not wellhead production. Supply, as defined by OPEC, is calculated as domestic consumption, plus net export sales of crude and products, plus withdrawals of stocks held outside national boundaries.</p>
<p>Five OPEC members have so far submitted production data for September. Data received so far by the secretariat from member countries is as follows (in thousand bpd),</p>
<p>			PRODUCTION	   SUPPLY     OPEC QUOTA</p>
