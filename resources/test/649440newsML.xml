<p>Russia's economy continued to contract in May, according to official figures released on Tuesday which confirmed the gloomy predictions of ministers who have put off a forecast recovery to next year.</p>
<p>The State Statistics Committee said gross domestic product (GDP), the broadest measure of economic activity, in the first five months of this year was 0.2 percent lower than a year earlier. GDP in May was 0.4 percent lower than in May 1996.</p>
<p>Earlier this year officials hailed an upturn in year-on-year GDP as a sign the economy was recovering after seven years of contraction, but the figures proved to be a false dawn, and recent data suggest the economy is bumping along the bottom.</p>
<p>Ministers have now revised their forecast of up to two percent growth this year to a decline of up to two percent, and say the recovery will not set in in earnest until next year.</p>
<p>But there are already signs of recovery.</p>
<p>Industrial output in the first five months of this year was 0.5 percent higher than a year earlier, and unemployment at the end of May was seven million people or 6.9 percent of the workforce, unchanged from a month earlier.</p>
<p>Inflation has continued to slow, with the year-on-year rate hitting a record low 14.6 percent in May.</p>
<p>But wage arrears, part of a larger web of unpaid bills choking the economy, rose again to 53.92 trillion roubles ($9.36 billion) at the start of June, after edging down in April.</p>
<p>Russia continued to run a trade surplus, which widened to $6.8 billion in the first four months of this year from $5.5 billion a year earlier, but that reflected a large drop in imports as well as a modest pick-up in exports -- further evidence that the economy is still in the doldrums.</p>
<p>Other figures released by the Central Bank showed that Russia's deficit on the overall balance of payments -- the net outcome of all its trade and financial transactions with the rest of the world -- doubled to $22.6 billion in 1996.</p>
<p>That was largely due to Russian savers and investors continuing to shift resources out of the country, with households buying $8.5 billion in cash to hold at home and companies leaving $4.2 billion of export receipts abroad in foreign currency.</p>
<p>The government had to spend $2.8 billion of its currency reserves, borrow $3.8 billion from the International Monetary Fund and $4.7 billion from other international organisations and foreign governments to plug the deficit.</p>
<p>It also rescheduled or failed to pay $11 billion in debt payments, so that actual debt service on the $127 billion foreign debt was only $7.1 billion in 1996 instead of the $18.1 billion due.</p>
<p>The Russian European Centre for Economic Policy, an institute sponsored by the European Union, said Russia would have run a deficit on its current account -- the balance of its trade in goods and services with the rest of the world -- in 1996 of $1.7 billion instead of the $9.3 billion surplus it actually posted, if it had paid all the interest and debt due.</p>
<p>But if countries owing Russia money had also paid up, Russia would have had a current account surplus of nearly $8 billion.</p>
<p>The figures also showed an improvement in the balance of payments towards the end of 1996, as Russian and foreign investors became more reassured about political stability.</p>
<p>Direct investment in the Russian economy rose to $2.5 billion in 1996 from $2.0 billion in 1995, while portfolio investment -- purchases of shares and bonds -- rose to $7.5 billion, mostly in the last three months, from $100 million.</p>
