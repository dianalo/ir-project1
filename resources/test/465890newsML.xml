<p>Olga Jovanovic, a 67-year-old retired bank clerk, faces a stark choice between buying bread or medicine for her sick husband. She cannot afford both.</p>
<p>Waiting patiently in the queue to pay for the drugs, she said she could face anything but another period of hyperinflation.</p>
<p>"I will kill myself if 1993 repeats itself," she said, her eyes brimming with tears at the thought of the time when her pension lasted only a few days.</p>
<p>The younger generation is just as unreconciled with the deteriorating standard of living. Dragan, 42, employed in an idle Belgrade metalworks, is completely disillusioned, unable to contemplate that his life could improve in the near future.</p>
<p>"I am fed up with everything. I cannot offer anything else to my children but poor food," he said. "But when I look around and see expensive clothes, restaurants, cars I get angry. I am prepared to do anything -- go on the street, fight with someone -- just to secure a better life for my children.</p>
<p>"Obviously, this system provides everything for some priviliged groups and for others there is nothing," he said.</p>
<p>GROWING SOCIAL TENSIONS UNDERMINE STABILITY</p>
<p>Political analysts say that Yugoslavia, with four years of war and political upheaval behind it and a fresh bout of recession ahead, is suffering from growing social tensions which threaten its stability.</p>
<p>With a growing public spending deficit and without access to urgently needed foreign funds, Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and his socialist government must find a way to meet increasing demands for wages and benefits ahead of elections due later this year.</p>
<p>"The key problem is that Milosevic's government is spending more than the country can produce. State coffers are burnt to a frazzle. But the authorities are unwilling to adjust their spending and this will be paid with huge social unrest," one analyst, talking under condition of anonymity, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Some analysts estimate that around one million people, or 10 percent of the population, have good reason to be unhappy with their social position.</p>
<p>"The ruling authorities should be aware of this as any disturbances may cost Milosevic's socialists dearly," the analyst said.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT UNLIKELY TO TOLERATE UNREST</p>
<p>But one Western diplomat said it was unlikely Milosevic, already shaken by three-months of street protests and an opposition victory in local elections, would allow any social disturbances.</p>
<p>"Milosevic must find a way to stay intact and ready for the elections. The real economic shock therapy can only come after the polls," the diplomat said.</p>
<p>PRESSURE FOR DELAYED WAGES AND BENEFITS GROWING</p>
<p>Analysts foresee increasing demands for the payment of a backlog of wages and benefits, as well as calls for correcting deep social differences and discrimination.</p>
<p>The socialists, during their six-year rule, have failed to reform the state administration. It is old fashioned, inefficient and expensive, and consumes a lion's share of the diminishing gross domestic product, leaving very limited space for investments, experts say.</p>
<p>"The government must stop cushioning state-run monopolies that are the biggest loss makers and end its policy of making discretionary decisions," said Stojan Stamenkovic, chief analyst of the Belgrade-based Institute for Economic Sciences (IEN).</p>
<p>The Institute said public spending has not decreased in line with Yugoslavia's economic decline and now accounts for more than 50 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>It would account for another 4-5 percent of the GDP if overdue and unpaid pensions, salaries, child and maternity benefits were included.</p>
<p>The government has forecast 1997 public spending at 47.5 percent of GDP, which is expected to grow 13 percent this year to 103.28 billion dinars ($186.4 million).</p>
<p>The public spending deficit in January reached 10 percent of its annual amount because the government collected only 2.74 billion dollars in revenue, 1.1 billion less than the previous month and a two-year low.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia generates income from sales and income tax and customs duties.</p>
<p>"The (public) spending deficit surged due to a drastic fall in revenue. But to keep the budget balanced and to avoid printing money, the government keeps delaying payments," said Danica Popovic of the private CES-Mecon research institute.</p>
<p>DELAYS IN PAYMENTS RATHER THAN AMOUNT MAY TRIGGER UNREST</p>
<p>Analysts say delays in the payment of wages and benefits, rather than the meagre amount, as the cause of potential unrest.</p>
<p>One in five of the roughly two million people in employment has not been paid since December or January, they say.</p>
<p>In January some 1.2 million pensioners received only half their November pension. The state's outstanding debt to pensioners for the two first months this year totals 2.5 billion dinars.</p>
<p>The average wage in January fell 12 percent to 618 dinars against December. The real-term value dropped by 13.2 percent.</p>
<p>Only 3.9 percent of the workforce earns more than the standard consumer basket, worth 1,451 dinars in January.</p>
<p>"This shows that a large group of people are already on the verge of social tolerance. Their subsistence level is threatened and they simply cannot afford to pay their liabilities," said Milena Jovicic.</p>
<p>She predicted that pressure for payment would come from the textiles and metals sectors and the leather and rubber industry.</p>
<p>Pressure for a higher standard of living could also come from those employed in trade, education, healthcare and the construction industry, she said.</p>
<p>The government, in its latest statement issued by the Tanjug news agency, said public revenues in 1996 were 36.967 billion dinars and accounted for 45.5 percent of estimated Gross Domestic Product, two index points below plans.</p>
<p>It admitted the fall in public spending was not giving the real picture considering the state's outstanding liabilities to pensioners, healthcare and government employees.</p>
<p>The report gave no details. It said only that "public spending has been financed solely out of real sources."</p>
<p>In 1996, the state called for consolidated public spending of up to 47.5 percent of estimated GDP.</p>
