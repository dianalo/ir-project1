<p>---------------------MARKET COMMENT--------------------------</p>
<p>* Canada's dollar ended mostly unchanged on Thursday from Wednesday's close of C$1.3815 (US$0.7238) in moderate trading. * Dealers said the currency continued under pressure from broad-based selling interests intent on pushing the Bank of Canada toward another short-term interest rate hike this year.  </p>
<p>Traders said weakness in the German mark led to some support for Canada's dollar as the the U.S. dollar rallied to a six-year high against the German mark.</p>
<p>The mark slid after the Bundesbank said its council left the German discount and Lombard rates unchanged at its regular policy-making meeting. The central bank's main money market rate, the repo, was also held steady for the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Dealers said that while the Canadian dollar received support from the German decision, the move simply took the unit off overnight lows and did not provide the impetus for a major rally.  </p>
<p>They said the Canadian dollar would likely remain in a narrow range from 1.3790 to 1.3840 until some susbstantive economic or political news upset the market.</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada last hiked interest rates on June 26, the first such increase in more than two years. In raising the key bank rate to 3.5 percent, the central bank said it was attempting to offset weakness in the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>On the crosses, Canada's dollar rose against the German mark to 1.3258 marks from 1.3174 marks. The dollar also rose to 83.96 yen from 83.53 yen.</p>
