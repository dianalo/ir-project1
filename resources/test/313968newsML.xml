<p>Philips Electronics NV said on Thursday it had agreed in principle to establish a joint venture with Hewlett-Packard Co to develop, manufacture and market LED-based lighting products.</p>
<p>Financial terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The joint venture, subject to EC approval, will be 51 percent owned by Philips and 49 percent by Hewlett-Packard.</p>
<p>"The joint venture initially will focus on the integration of solid-state light-emitting diodes (LEDs) into lighting modules for coloured-lighting applications," Philips said.</p>
<p>Operating at arm's length from the parent companies, it will sell its products worldwide to original equipment makers for use in end products and systems, with first products expected to be available in the second half of 1998.</p>
