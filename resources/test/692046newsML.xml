<p>Demand for interbank deposits topped supply on the Bulgarian money market and depo rates were flat from Thursday despite a central bank decision to cut its main interest rate, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Rates stood flat as banks actively bid for funds on their own behalf and on behalf of clients to meet tax and salary payments due by end-month and end-quarter," said a bank dealer.</p>
<p>Overnight interbank depo rates were flat from Thursday's 11-12 percent annually while deposits for up to seven days were borrowed at an annual interest of 15-16 percent, also unchanged.</p>
<p>Traders expected depo rates to fall next week if demand for funds subsided to adjust to a cut in the central bank main interest rate to 10.12 percent simple annual or an effective annual 10.60 percent, to take effect on Monday.</p>
<p>The main interest rate is now set at an effective annual 16.30 percent.</p>
<p>The average annual interbank deposit rate was 13.71 percent on Thursday against 15.10 percent on Wednesday, a central bank official said. -- Dessislava Popova, Sofia Newsroom, (++359-2) 91188</p>
