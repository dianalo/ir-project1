<p>South Africa can no longer afford to delay drastic action aimed at beefing up its revenue collection services, the country's Auditor-General Henri Kleuver warned on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Despite promises 13 months ago that the new South African Revenue Service (SARS) would streamline and modernise inland revenue and customs collection, "we are still saying tomorrow is the day," he told the parliamentary public accounts committee.</p>
<p>"While we are sitting here talking, containers with contraband and illegal substances are coming in through Durban and cars stolen by syndicates are going out towards the north of the country...as far as I am concerned, it is a matter of desperate urgency," Kleuver said.</p>
<p>The amalgamation of South Africa's two revenue services, Inland Revenue and the Department of Customs and Excise into the SARS last year had been "a long litany of woes". Kleuver said he had been forced to withold an audit report on the completeness of revenue collection in South Africa.</p>
<p>Kleuver said he had no problem with the South African system of self-declaration of taxes due as long as adequate checks could be made to ensure that all possible revenue was coming in.</p>
<p>This was patently not the case and the state was "not in a position to collect all revenue" which affected  efficient delivery of services as well as important macro-economic variables, he said.</p>
<p>Making his first appearance before the committee, newly appointed SARS chief executive Piet Liebenberg said the SARS was being hampered by the fact that it still did not have the autonomy to appoint staff at market-related salaries.</p>
<p>"We are planning a very extensive programme of training, but there is no way that I would be prepared to spend those vast amounts of money knowing that those people will walk out of the front door the moment that we have trained them," he said.</p>
<p>It had been calculated that if an extra 120 people were trained, the state could collect an additional 350 million rand after two years, Liebenberg said.</p>
<p>Civil service salaries are limited by the Public Service and Administration Department through negotiations with unions.</p>
<p>Several committee members said they were "astounded" that revenue collection had been allowed to continue to deteriorate and urged speedy action to draft the necessary legislation to ensure the SARS' autonomy.</p>
