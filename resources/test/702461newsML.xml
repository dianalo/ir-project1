<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to maintain the yield at 9.0 percent at the fortnightly auction of 364-day treasury bills on Wednesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The RBI is deliberately keeping a low cut-off," the head of money markets at a Bombay bank said.</p>
<p>Many dealers said the response at the treasury bill auction is impacted by the prevailing overnight call money rates.</p>
<p>Call rates were quoted at 7.75-8.75 percent in latest trade, up from 7.5-8.5 percent opening, dealers said.</p>
<p>Because of the firm call rates, response at Wednesday's auction will be lukewarm, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The bank rate cut has no impact on treasury bill yields," said R. Narayan, assistant manager (treasury) at Bank of Nova Scotia. "Notwithstanding a cut in bank rate and deposit rate, there is no incentive to bid below nine percent."</p>
