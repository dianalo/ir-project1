<p>Shares in British Telecommunications Plc fell in heavy trade on Monday after weekend press reports said the company would definitely be hit by the new government's proposed windfall tax on privatised utilities.</p>
<p>The shares fell 5p to 446-1/2p. By 0827 GMT, volume had topped three million.  </p>
<p>The Observer newspaper said on Sunday that BT would definitely be among the companies subjected to the levy.</p>
<p>It cited the new Paymaster General, whom it described as an "architect" of the tax, as saying, "It's hard to see how (BT) could be left out. It's only a question of how much it will have to pay."</p>
<p>BT responded by saying "We do not believe that the windfall tax should apply to BT. We are not a monopoly."</p>
<p>Analyst Steve Scruton at Credit Lyonnais Laing said, "I am sure they will include BT within the tax legally but when it comes to setting up the formula, they could choose one that determines whether or not BT pay anything."  </p>
<p>"BT's executives haven't taken big pay rises, and investors that took up the last share issue did not make excess returns," Scruton said.</p>
<p>"BT is bigger than the entire water sector. Once it is merged with MCI, it will have a market cap of around 40 billion stg. It could absorb the whole of the windfall tax without necessarily changing my (hold) recommendation on the shares."</p>
<p>Scruton expects the company to escape the windfall levy or at worst face a charge no higher than one billion pounds.</p>
<p>Analysts forecast the company will report annual profits of around 3.196 billion stg on Thursday.</p>
