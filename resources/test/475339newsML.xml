<p>Palestinians on Saturday rejected Israel's conditions for resuming peace talks while protesters burned its prime minister in effigy during a 10th day of clashes spurred by Israeli settlement building in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>At least 10 Palestinians were wounded when Israeli troops fired rubber bullets at demonstrators stoning them at the outskirts of Bethlehem, Ramallah, and Bir Zeit in the West Bank.</p>
<p>At Bethlehem, protesters burned an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Later, they lobbed stones over a bus full of foreign tourists leaving the traditional birthplace of Jesus when it came between them and the Israeli troops.</p>
<p>The surge of violence did not bode well for Sunday's Easter celebrations when Christian pilgrims were expected to flock to sites sacred to them in the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat told reporters in Gaza on his return from Cairo: "Netanyahu's orders and decisions are escalating the situation in the whole area."</p>
<p>Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah said: "What is needed is the implementation of the agreements and the return to the negotiating table without any preconditions or restrictions.</p>
<p>"The new Israeli conditions are not acceptable."</p>
<p>Netanyahu said after meeting U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross on Friday that only a sustained Palestinian crackdown on "terrorism" -- not just a pledge to fight militants -- would salvage peacemaking.</p>
<p>He demanded Arafat arrest militants, dismantle guerrilla groups and tighten cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian security forces. He denied Ross asked Israel to make any reciprocal gesture.</p>
<p>Israeli Internal Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani told Israel Television that Israel should not rely on the Authority to provide it security.</p>
<p>"Generally, the feeling that we are dependent on them is an awful feeling for the State of Israel -- the great, the grand, the strong -- which has made many wars here," Kahalani said.</p>
<p>Arafat, asked by reporters if Ross in their meeting in Rabat on Thursday requested him to calm tensions in areas controlled by his Palestinian Authority that abut Israeli army positions where there have been clashes said:</p>
<p>"Yes, they are against the violence, especially the violence of settlement and the Judaization of Jerusalem."</p>
<p>Palestinian-Israeli peace moves plunged into crisis this month after Israel began the settlement at a hilltop in Arab East Jerusalem called Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic and Har Homa in Hebrew and after an Islamist suicide bombing in Tel Aviv that killed three Israelis.</p>
<p>Israel says Arafat gave militants the impression they had a green light for attacks. The Authority denies the charge.</p>
<p>Palestinians say settlement building in Jerusalem preempts negotiations that are to be held on its status in final peace talks which have yet to resume. They demand it be halted.</p>
<p>Europe's Middle East envoy, Miguel Angel Moratinos, speaking to reporters after meeting Arafat in Gaza, said political issues should be the top priority in peace talks.</p>
<p>"From the European point of view, the political issue is the first priority," he said.</p>
<p>"We have also to convey the security issue. President Arafat told me he is always condemning terrorism and violence...I'm going to bring this matter to Prime Minister Netanyahu," he said. Moratinos did not say when he would meet Netanyahu.</p>
<p>The White House said on Friday that Ross's two-day emergency mission to the region had been "constructive" but that more work was needed to salvage crumbling peace moves.</p>
<p>Thousands of Israeli police, backed by tanks and helicopters, remained on high alert ahead of warnings unrest would peak on Sunday -- the annual "Land Day" when Israeli Arabs stage protests against government confiscation of lands.</p>
