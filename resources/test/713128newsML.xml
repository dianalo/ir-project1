<p>Taiwan's money rates closed sharply higher on Tuesday, reflecting tightened liquidity in the banking system following the central bank's mop-up measure on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>The overnight interbank rate finished at 6.856 percent against Monday's 6.588 finish -- outside the central bank's 5.0-5.5 percent target zone but still far below the double-digit closes of late June.</p>
<p>The 30-day commercial paper rose to 7.25 percent against 6.50-6.75.  </p>
<p>The central bank on Monday issued T$11 billion negotiable certificates of deposit.</p>
<p>Dealers expected the overnight interbank rate to rise to around 7.00 percent on Wednesday as the island's sizzling stock market continued to siphon money out of the banking system.</p>
<p>The benchmark index eased slightly on Tuesday, closing 0.19 percent or 17.57 points lower at 9,305.27. But turnover remained heavy at T$175.79 billion.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the benchmark 10-year 86/4 bond yield was traded at 5.8970-5.9450 percent range.</p>
