<p>Testifying in court for the first time, O.J. Simpson looked directly into the eyes of the jury and proclaimed his innocence on Friday, saying it was "abolutely not true" that he killed his ex-wife and her friend.</p>
<p>In a dramatic, rapid-fire exchange that concluded Simpson's initial 4-1/2-hour stint on the witness stand in his civil trial, Daniel Petrocelli, the plaintiffs' lead attorney, lashed into the former football star with a series of harsh accusations.</p>
<p>Testifying in a loud, clear voice, his face sometimes showing the strain of the heated courtroom clash, Simpson refused to yield an inch to his interrogator.</p>
<p>Simpson -- who was acquitted of double-murder charges in October 1995 -- had declared his innocence many times before, but never in front of a jury and never so emphatically.</p>
<p>"You had gloves, you had a hat, you had a knife. And you used that Bronco to go to Nicole's condo, didn't you?" Petrocelli asked in a calm voice.</p>
<p>"That's absolutely not true," said Simpson, who is fighting a wrongful-death civil lawsuit brought by the victims' families.</p>
<p>"And you confronted Nicole Brown Simpson and you killed her, didn't you?" Petrocelli continued.</p>
<p>"That is absolutely not true," Simpson replied forcefully, looking directly at the jury.</p>
<p>"And you killed Ronald Goldman, did you or did you not?" Petrocelli asked.</p>
<p>"That's absolutely not true," Simpson shot back.</p>
<p>Glaring at Simpson from the lectern, Petrocelli then accused him of driving from the murder scene outside his ex- wife's Brentwood townhouse to his mansion two miles (three km) away. "You got onto your property and you bumped into a wall at 10:50 - 10:51," Petrocelli asserted.</p>
<p>"That's absolutely not true," Simpson said.</p>
<p>"You dropped one of the gloves there and you put your clothing in a bag and you put it behind (a car in the driveway)," the attorney stated.</p>
<p>"That's absolutely not true," Simpson repeated.</p>
<p>Petrocelli then claimed that Simpson bled "all over" the driveway of his estate. But Simpson continued his litany of denials, saying, "That is absolutely incorrect."</p>
<p>Asked whether "a single living human being" could vouch for his whereabouts between 9:35 and 10:55 p.m. on the night of the killings, Simpson acknowledged that no one saw or spoke to him. The various alibis he has given before are that he was chipping golf balls, walking his dog or taking a shower.</p>
<p>During the entire tense exchange, jurors listened intently, sometimes scribbling furiously in their notebooks.</p>
<p>Several legal analysts who attended Friday's session said the plaintiffs had succeeded in damaging Simpson's credibility, and attorneys for the families were elated over how things went.</p>
<p>"We got our point across to the jury," a source on the plaintiffs' side said. "His protestations of innocence weren't convincing at all."</p>
<p>Simpson was due to return to the witness stand Monday and may continue testifying Tuesday.</p>
<p>Simpson began his first full day of testimony denying that he had ever beaten Nicole Brown Simpson but claiming that she struck him "numerous times."</p>
<p>While jurors looked at photos of a bruised, battered Nicole Brown Simpson projected on a giant courtroom TV screen, Simpson said his ex-wife lied when she wrote in her journals and told others that he had abused her.</p>
<p>Instead, directly contradicting the testimony of witnesses in both trials, Simpson portrayed himself as the victim of an erratic and sometimes violent woman. He said that even after their 1992 divorce, she was the one who pursued him.</p>
<p>Attorneys for the families have contended that Simpson abused, stalked and threatened his ex-wife, finally killing her in June 1994 when he could no longer control her.</p>
<p>It was the first crucial confrontation between Simpson and opposing attorneys representing the victims' families, who are seeking to find him responsbile -- and financially "liable" -- for the murders. If he loses the case, he could be forced to pay millions of dollars in damages.</p>
<p>Testifying as a "hostile" witness, Simpson started off speaking calmly. But as the questioning turned combative, he at times became exasperated, sighing heavily and clenching his fists in front of him. Goldman's father, Fred, and sister, Kim, glared at Simpson from the spectators' gallery.</p>
<p>While Simpson chose not to testify at his criminal trial, the rules of civil procedure required him to either take the witness stand or forfeit the case.</p>
