Conversely, Southington shareholders will receive 0.764 HUBCO shares for each of their shares if HUBCO's stock price averages less than $27.50 in the period.</p>
<p>HUBCO said the Southington board has certain rights to cancel the deal if the median HUBCO stock price is below $22.00 in the preriod.  </p>
<p>HUBCO said it will merge Southington into its Connecticut subsidiary, Lafayette American Bank, which will have about $1.4 billion in assets and 30 offices after the merger. It added its other subsidiary, Hudson United Bank, has about $1.7 billion in assets and 57 offices.</p>
