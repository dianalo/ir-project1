<p>Poland's Kredyt Bank seeks about 100 million zlotys in subordinated loans to effect its planned merger with Polish Investment Bank (PBI), which could be completed by year-end, Kredyt's president said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Stanislaw Pacuk told Reuters that the loans, about which he gave no details, would be taken from three banks, one of them large state-owned bank PKO BP.</p>
<p>Pacuk said Kredyt Bank would also likely receive about 70 million zlotys in loans from the Banking Guarantee Fund (BFG), which would provide credit over the seven years necessary to refinance Prosper Bank, which Kredyt was required to buy with PBI.</p>
<p>Prosper has 161 million zlotys in accumulated losses.</p>
<p>"It (the purchase) is being financed through our own funds -- the loans are necessary to maintain our cash flow," he said.</p>
<p>Kredyt had 219.1 million zlotys in own funds at the end of 1996 and made a net profit that year of 23.2 million zlotys.</p>
<p>On Friday Kredyt agreed to buy from the central bank all of PBI and 92.36 percent of Prosper for 205 million zlotys and invest nearly another 290 million zlotys, forming Poland's ninth largest bank in terms of assets.</p>
<p>PBI made a 55.2-million-zloty net profit in 1996 and ended the year with a capital of 197.1 million zlotys.</p>
<p>At the end of last year Kredyt, PBI and Prosper had balance sheet totals of 1.07 billion, 4.56 billion and 557 million zlotys respectively.</p>
<p>Pacuk said Kredyt was mulling raising the price of its late-April, 10-million-share issue set at eight zlotys each.</p>
<p>He said the share price of the issue, proceeds of which would go to the bank purchases, would be at a discount to the market price shortly before the issue. Kredyt shares closed on Tuesday at 8.8 zlotys.</p>
<p>Kredyt is also offering 847,000 shares to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Pacuk said Kredyt was considering whether to conduct yet another share issue.</p>
<p>He said Arthur Andersen would advise on the merger.</p>
<p>Pacuk said Kredyt, which is forming a banking-insurance group with privatising Powszechny Bank Kredytowy SA (PBK), BPH, PBR and insurer Warta, sought about five percent of PBK in its sale due this month.</p>
<p>He said Kredyt would maintain its 4.5-percent stake in Warta and its roughly one-third stake in insurer  Agropolisa SA but could reduce its similar stake in insurer  Heros.</p>
<p>He said Kredyt would combine its 53 branches with the 151 of PBI, which also has clients doing business in Lithuania, Ukraine and Russia.</p>
<p>"We will have a greater number of clients doing business with the East and after the merger and the combining of our capital there will be greater opportunities," Pacuk said.</p>
