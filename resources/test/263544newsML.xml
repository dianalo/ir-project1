<p>The hostile bid from CE Electric for British regional electricity company (Rec) Northern Electric heated up in its closing stages on Wednesday as the U.S. firm criticised share buying by financial advisers.</p>
<p>"We believe this does represent frustrating action under the (Stock Exchange takeover) code and have taken appropriate action in this regard," a spokesman for the company said.</p>
<p>But Northern countered by saying the purchases of around 2.3 percent of the company showed BZW and Schroders "believe there is considerable opportunity in investing in Northern".</p>
<p>BZW is Northern's broker while Schroders is its financial adviser in the bid.</p>
<p>Advisers can buy up to 15 percent of a client's shares under takeover panel rules but such moves in the past have been criticised as they can help to swing the outcome of a bid.</p>
<p>Northern is fighting off CE Electric's 650 pence a share bid, which closes on December 20.</p>
<p>CE Electric, which is 70-percent owned by CalEnergy of the U.S., has already gained control of around 34 percent of the company.</p>
<p>No one was immediately available for comment at the Takeover Panel or Northern's advisers.</p>
