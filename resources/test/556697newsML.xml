<p>A group of armed assailants attacked the Istanbul office of Turkey's Flash TV television channel on Friday in apparent reaction to a programme on organised crime, causing damage but no casualties, the channel said.</p>
<p>"A group of 50 or 60 people came in and said they wanted to talk. They were smartly dressed, wearing suits and ties, and we went to shake their hands and they attacked," Flash TV Istanbul editor Yalcin Cakir said in a live broadcast from a delapidated studio.</p>
<p>The attackers split into groups and raided other studios, some breaking windows and shooting randomly. They shot at people who tried to reach for the telephones, Cakir said.</p>
<p>The attackers were shouting "who made this broadcast", "why did you do this" and "you will pay for this", he said.</p>
<p>Flash TV reporters said the attack may have been a retaliation to a recent live telephone interview with leading organised crime boss Alaattin Cakici in which he implicated several figures.</p>
<p>"It was really lucky that nobody was hurt by the bullets," Cakir said.</p>
