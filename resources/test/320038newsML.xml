<p>Indonesia on Monday released the provisional list of parliamentary candidates for the May 29 general elections, with four of President Suharto's children and a daughter-in-law running for the ruling Golkar party.</p>
<p>The list of 2,293 candidates for the three parties legally entitled to contest the elections also includes a singer, an actor, businessmen and government ministers.</p>
<p>There was no mention of ousted minority party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri or her supporters from the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI), which now is headed by deputy parliamentary speaker Surjadi with government backing.</p>
<p>Political analysts said the government supported last June's ouster of Megawati, daughter of Indonesia's first president Sukarno, because it feared she was becoming too popular.</p>
<p>The takeover of the PDI headquarters by Surjadi's supporters sparked the worst riots in Jakarta in more than two decades.</p>
<p>The candidates are vying for 425 seats in the 500-seat parliament. The remaining 75 seats are filled by the armed forces, whose members do not vote in the elections.</p>
<p>Candidates from among Suharto's six children include eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, also known as Tutut, second daughter Siti Hedijati, second son Bambang Trihadmodjo and youngest son Hutomo Mandala "Tommy" Putra.</p>
<p>His daughter-in-law Halimah Trihadmodjo, wife of Bambang, is also running. Siti Hedijati is the wife of Major-General Prabowo Subianto, commander of the Indonesian Special Forces (Kopassus).</p>
<p>Only Golkar, the Moslem-oriented United Development Party (PPP) and the Christian-Nationalist PDI are allowed to contest the concurrent national, regional and municipal elections.</p>
<p>Golkar won 68 percent of the vote in the last elections in 1992, the PPP 17 percent and the PDI 15 percent.</p>
<p>Golkar's lists contains 829 candidates, the PPP 720 and the PDI 744 for the general elections.</p>
<p>Golkar candidates include a television actor, a singer, an ethnic Chinese businesswoman and several other businessmen known to have close links with the government.</p>
<p>All the candidates have been cleared by the country's security apparatus to ensure none is a member of the banned communist party or has had any connections with it in the past.</p>
<p>Walujo, a deputy secretary-general of the election commission, said on Monday the list was provisional because the public was entitled to raise complaints or objections against candidates.</p>
<p>"We will consult with the respective political organisations regarding public objections," he told reporters. The objection period runs to February 18.</p>
<p>The official election campaign runs from April 29 to May 23, with the elections on May 29.</p>
