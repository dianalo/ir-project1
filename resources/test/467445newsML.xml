<p>Germany's DAG white-collar trade union said on Tuesday that it planned to meet German airline Lufthansa AG to seek an end to the pay dispute between the two parties.</p>
<p>DAG said that it and the OeTV public sector and transport union would meet Lufthansa together to find a solution to the continuing pay dispute.</p>
<p>DAG said that it accepted the OeTV agreement with Lufthansa made previously.  </p>
<p>"Any long-term presentation of employee interests to secure jobs requires a merging of our strengths as trade unions," the OeTV chief Herbert Mai and DAG head Roland Issen said in a joint statement.</p>
<p>Up until now both unions have negotiated separately. There were some areas of agreement still to be reached between the two unions, the joint statement ran, which would be discussed at a meeting on April 7.</p>
<p>On October 25 last year the OeTV union agreed a settlement with Lufthansa, which involved a one-off payment of up to 33 percent of monthly pay and a wage increase of 1.7 percent. The wage agreement runs until the end of 1998.</p>
