<p>Shanghai soybean futures ended mixed on Friday with investors liquidating positions in the May contract to avoid physical delivery, but they were reluctant to trade other contracts as uncertainties prevailed, traders said.</p>
<p>The most actively traded May 1997 contract ended at 3,318 yuan ($400) per tonne, losing 76 yuan. It opened at 3,300 yuan, hitting an intraday high of 3,398 and a low of 3,290.</p>
<p>July rose 15 yuan to 3,305, September four to 3,348, November rose seven to 3,385, the January 1998 contract fell four to 3,390 yuan per tonne.</p>
<p>Combined volume rose to 29,100 tonnes from 23,400 tonnes.  </p>
<p>"Most investors rushed to liquidate the May contract as the May 20 delivery date draws near," one trader said.</p>
<p>"Few investors were willing to trade in other contracts because they cannot predict short term market trend," he said.</p>
<p>Traders said investors would continue liquidating the May contract while other contracts were expected to move in a narrow range in the short term.</p>
