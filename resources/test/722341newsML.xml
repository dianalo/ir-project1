<p>Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz looks set to survive a confidence vote in his minority government on Saturday as more defections and resignations from the opposition strengthen his support in parliament.</p>
<p>The eve of the vote saw two MPs resign from a rival conservative party and a group of independents swear allegiance to Yilmaz's loose alliance of left and right-wing secularists.</p>
<p>Yilmaz was appointed prime minister two weeks ago to replace Necmettin Erbakan, who stepped down last month after a stormy year in office as Turkey's first Islamist leader.</p>
<p>"This government will be useful even if only to find a solution to lift Turkey from its trauma and deep division," conservative independent Emre Gonensay said ahead of the vote. Three other MPs not affiliated to parties said they would back Yilmaz.</p>
<p>The powerful generals, self-appointed guardians of Turkey's secularist order, had begun to hint of army intervention against the Islamists after months of public disputes over Erbakan's attempts to raise the profile of Islam in public life.</p>
<p>Yilmaz's majority on paper is around 15 votes over the combined opposition, led by Erbakan's Islam-based Welfare Party.</p>
<p>The margin could be widened by opposition conservatives staying away from parliament in quiet protest at their True Path Party leader Tansu Ciller's ties to the Islamists.</p>
<p>Yilmaz and his two government partners have 216 MPs. They also expect the support of 49 other left-wing deputies, two rightists and 17 of the independents in the 550-seat assembly.</p>
<p>Ranged against Yilmaz are 157 Islamists, eight far-rightists and 99 conservative True Path MPs, some of whom are suspected of sympathy for the government.</p>
<p>"The government will win the vote tomorrow by a wide margin," Zeki Cakan, a leading MP in conservative Yilmaz's Motherland Party, told a news conference on Friday.</p>
<p>Shares on Istanbul's stock market were boosted by hopes Yilmaz would win Saturday's vote. The IMKB National-100 closed on Friday at an all time high of 2,027, up 28 points, or 1.4 percent on the day.</p>
<p>Yilmaz has promised to introduce anti-Islamist legislation, particularly on education, before taking the country to early elections next year, well before polls are due in the year 2000.</p>
<p>Left-wing party leader Deniz Baykal, with 49 MPs crucial to the government, has said he wants earlier polls.</p>
<p>But Baykal promised to vote for the coalition to keep the previous Islamist-led government out of power, rather than out of support for Yilmaz.</p>
<p>Yilmaz has said changes in the voting law and a new electoral register are needed before elections can be held.</p>
<p>He has also promised to speed up privatisation, despite being in partnership with another left-wing party opposed in the past to selling state assets.</p>
<p>Yilmaz is strongly pushing Turkey's uphill bid to join the European Union, in contrast to the Islamists whose efforts to get closer to radical Moslem nations Iran and Libya annoyed Turkey's secularists and Western allies.</p>
<p>A True Path MP who quit on Friday called on the party to overthrow leader Ciller, a pro-Western former foreign minister who dismayed secularists by forming a coalition with the Islamists last year.</p>
<p>"I hope that the colleagues I have left behind will be able to achieve the resignation of the chairwoman," Demir Berberoglu said in his resignation letter.</p>
<p>Corruption accusations against Ciller, who became Turkey's first woman leader in 1993, have begun to resurface since she left office.</p>
