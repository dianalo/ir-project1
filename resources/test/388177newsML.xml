<p>MobileMedia Corp said on Wednesday that U.S. Bankruptcy Court has approved the company's debtor in possession facility.</p>
<p>The company previously announced that Chase Manhattan Bank, as agent, is providing up to $200 million in financing.  </p>
<p>Mobilemedia, a paging and personal communications service, said it has already used $48 million of the facility to pay key suppliers.</p>
<p>The court's approval gives the company access to an additional $30 million of the facility for a total of $100 million, Mobilemedia said.</p>
<p>The remaining $100 million will become available on May 1, 1997, if the company delivers a business plan by April 15, 1997 that is approved by the banks' financial advisor, Mobilemedia said.</p>
