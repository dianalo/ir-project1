<p>----------------- VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - June 18 -------------</p>
<p>* The emphasis on NYMEX oil prices is lower for the short term but most markets have good support still in place.</p>
<p>* Recent congestion around $19 a barrel is forming a bear flag pattern on spot charts which could eventually tip the market lower.</p>
<p>NYMEX crude and products futures are seen continuing to trade sideways, but analysts say the emphasis is toward the lower side for the short term even though most markets have good supports still in place.</p>
<p>"The technical backdrop remains quite supportive in the short term and this may help limit the downside," GNI Research said in its daily report.</p>
<p>However, analysts said recent congestion around $19 a barrel is forming a bearish flag pattern on the front-month continuation chart between the $19.85 high of June 6 and last Wednesday's low of $18.41, which could eventually tip the market lower.</p>
<p>The $18.41 level of last week was the market's lowest since mid-February last year when the market bounced up to a high of $25.60 a barrel. Trendline support down from the market's most recent peak at $26.74 in early January was held when the market broke up from last week's $18.41 low, but analysts say stiff upside resistance may halt further gains for a while.</p>
<p>Fenella Graham at MeesPierson said, "Preparation remains against the grain on WTI and is still negative. We therefore continue to sell the rallies looking for a buying extreme to take profits."</p>
<p>"Unlike elsewhere we can join the breaks lower, but we remain wary the rest of the market is neutral so if prices start to improve in other markets we must consider taking profits on shorts here," Graham added.</p>
<p>Unleaded gasoline futures are showing a similar bear flag pattern between the June 6 high at 60.15 cents and last week's 56-cent low, but the 56-cent level represents a supportive double bottom and doji candlesticks, a key reversal signal according to Japanese candlestick charting techniques.</p>
<p>"Preparation for gasoline is edging higher but still remains firmly in neutral for the time being," Graham said.</p>
<p>Heating oil too is becoming congested at the bottom of the fourth wave of a series of recent up-waves but with no bear flag showing.</p>
<p>However, the market has edged slightly higher recently taking it off last Wednesday's 51.20 low. The market showed a similar pattern of trade last year when after hitting 51.17 in late June it finally peaked at 76.75 in October.</p>
