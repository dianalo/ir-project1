<p>American champion Jon Drummond almost crashed out of the world men's 200 metres on Wednesday when he lost his balance in the final metres while leading his first round heat.</p>
<p>In what initially appeared premature victory celebrations, Drummond threw his right arm in the air, slowed dramatically and was lucky to finish in third place and win an automatic place in the second round.</p>
<p>Drummond said he had put his arm up to regain his balance because he was worried about stepping out of his lane.</p>
<p>"I twisted my torso and held up my arm to keep balance," he said.</p>
<p>"I looked up at the scoreboard and was worried that I would see a DNF (did not finish) or DQ (disqualified). When it said Q (qualified), I said 'Lord, thanks. I owe you one'."</p>
<p>Namibia's former world champion Frankie Fredericks suffered on a hard track which is supposed to be a sprinter's paradise when he began his campaign.</p>
<p>Fredericks, who just missed out on a medal in the 100 metres, had to work hard in the second half of the race to take second place in his first round heat behind Belgian winner Erik Wijmeersch who won in 20.71 seconds. The Namibian clocked 20.74.</p>
<p>The Athens track, similar to the one built for the Atlanta Olympics last year when Michael Johnson set an astonishing world record over 200 of 19.32, is supposed to be perfect for sprinters although it is regarded as being too hard for distance runners.</p>
<p>But Fredericks, who has been suffering with an injury to his right knee, said: "The race did not feel so easy. This injury has been with me all season and this hard track has made it worse. I'll just see how it feels and give it my all."</p>
<p>Ato Boldon, the bronze medallist at last year's Atlanta Olympics, had no problems moving through to the second round later in the day when he won his heat in a quick 20.48.</p>
<p>"I did not want to run that fast but they made me run," said Boldon who finished fifth in Sunday's 100 final. "If I had run a 21.00 flat I would not have qualified."</p>
