<p>A bullish morning on Wall Street ahead of U.S. election results and the apparently successful conclusion of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's heart surgery boosted German and French bourses on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The London Stock exchange was the exception, ignoring New York and closing down with sentiment dogged, among other things, by worries about rising British interest rates and the damage which might be done to exports by a strengthening pound.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average was up more than half a percentage point when European trading closed aided by a strong bond market and Wall Street's growing conviction that the Democrats would not take back control of Congress. A little later the Dow hit 6,092.37, a rise of 50.68 points, which activated the New York Stock Exchange's limits on program trading.</p>
<p>On the currency markets, the dollar was firmer in late Europe against the mark and yen but turnover was subdued as the market awaited the results of the U.S. presidential and congressional polls.</p>
<p>"We know Clinton will be the future U.S. president, but the key is who will control Congress," said a Geneva-based trader.</p>
<p>If Clinton's Democrats make gains in the race to control the U.S. Congress, the dollar and Treasuries are expected to ease slightly in the short term, a Reuters survey of economists showed.</p>
<p>The poll showed that a Democratic victory in either the Senate or the House of Representatives would have more of a negative effect than if Republicans retained control of both.</p>
<p>In Moscow, doctors involved in Yeltsin's bypass operation declared it a complete success and said he would be able to resume normal work.</p>
<p>While the dollar was unimpressed, Russian debt and equity traded overseas reacted positively to the news. The Swiss franc, a traditional safe-haven currency, had been boosted in early trade by nerves surrounding Yeltsin's heart surgery but pulled back later when it became clear the surgery was successful.</p>
<p>The pound sterling continued its sparkling bull run, hitting $1.6560 -- its best level since March 1995 -- and sizing up key chart resistance around $1.6575.</p>
<p>On the stock markets, the mood in Frankfurt and Paris contrasted strongly with that in London, Europe's biggest bourse. French shares closed sharply higher, but below the year's highs, on the back of a rally in bonds, market relief over Yeltsin's heart surgery and bullishness on Wall Street.</p>
<p>And in Frankfurt stocks also ended bourse trade at the day's high and bounded further ahead in post-bourse computer trading after New York's firm start. They finally closed post bourse trade with the 30-share IBIS DAX index up 37.43 points or 1.4 percent at 2,716.16.</p>
<p>Traders said the German market had been boosted not only by bullish New York but also by government bonds which raced to a new high on the reports that Yeltsin's operation was successful.</p>
<p>But in London leading stocks slipped to their lowest level in six weeks hit by weak futures prices and worries about interest rates and the U.S. elections.</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 share index ended the day at 3,921.1 points, down 7.0 points on the day and just 10 points off the day's low, as investors ignored firm gilts, the solid start on Wall Street and strong performances from bourses across much of Europe.</p>
<p>"People here are worked up into believing Wall Street is heading for a fall and this country is well aware how wrong opinion polls can be," one dealer said, referring to British Prime Minister John Major's surprise re-election in 1992.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1645 GMT The dollar was trading at 1.5188 marks and 114.05 yen compared with late Monday's 1.5142 marks and 113.93 yen.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS CLOSING PRICES</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares ended 7.0 points lower at 3,921.1.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index finished up 45.71 at 2,187.32.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt closed up 19.43 at 2,691.29.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold closed at $379.35 compared with $379.05 at the London close on Monday. Silver ended two cents higher at $4.84.</p>
