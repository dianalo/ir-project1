<p>Switzerland's Roman Catholic bishops asked Jews on Thursday to forgive their church for centuries of anti-Semitism that indirectly supported Hitler's efforts to wipe out European Jewry in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>"It is true that this plan was instigated by a regime that was hostile to Christianity and that persecuted Christians and churches," the Conference of Swiss Bishops said in a statement prompted by a national debate over Switzerland's wartime role.</p>
<p>"But we are aware that Christians and those in authority in our churches amassed guilt by isolating and persecuting Jews for centuries and that they promoted hostility to Jews. We must note with horror that religious motives played a role at that time in a way that is incomprehensible today."</p>
<p>It added: "On behalf of the churches of the past we admit the guilt that occurred then and ask the heirs of those affected for forgiveness, as Pope Johl Paul II has done in light of the upcoming year of reconciliation."</p>
<p>Christian churches in Switzerland had already expressed their regret about anti-Semitism when they issued a joint declaration marking the 50th anniversary of the end of World War Two, a conference spokesman said, but this statement was more far-reaching.</p>
<p>It comes amid Swiss soul-searching about their economic collaboration with Nazi Germany and their anti-Jewish wartime refugee policy that turned back thousands of Jews.</p>
<p>Swiss officials have acknowledged the country made moral compromises to ensure tiny, neutral Switzerland survived although surrounded by fascist powers.</p>
<p>The Pope has made many strong statements against anti-Semitism and about the need not to forget the victims of the Holocaust, in which the Nazis murdered six million Jews.</p>
