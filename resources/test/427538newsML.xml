<p>A Berlin court sentenced three former East German intelligence officers to two years' probation on Friday for sheltering ten of West Germany's most wanted guerrillas.</p>
<p>Harry Dahl, 67, chief of the counter-terrorism department in the once feared Ministry for State Security (Stasi), and two officers, Guenter Jaeckel, 62, and Gerd Zaumseil, 48, were convicted of preventing the course of justice.</p>
<p>The case was the latest to try to establish how far East Berlin supported international terrorism and punish those behind an "unholy alliance" between the Stasi and the leftist Red Army Faction (RAF), that struck fear into the West German establishment during the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>The court also issued formal reprimands to the three ex-Stasi officers and said they would be fined between 2,400 marks ($1,400) and 5,000 marks ($2,900) if they violated the terms of their probation.</p>
<p>Charges were dropped against a fourth former Stasi officer, Hans-Hermann Petzold, 52, on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The men were accused of allowing the guerrillas to enter East Germany, creating identities for them, and giving them flats and jobs to blend them into everyday life there from 1980 to 1990, thus helping them escape authorities in the West.</p>
<p>"It was illegal for East Germany to take in the RAF guerrillas," presiding judge Peter Faust said.</p>
<p>"As senior Stasi officers they must have known the terrorists were wanted in West Germany. Their guilt is small, though, because they confessed," Faust said in his judgment.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers for the men told the court they would appeal against the verdict.</p>
<p>Zaumseil's lawyer Ruediger Portius argued it was unjust to convict the former counter-terrorism officers when justice authorities had such difficulty in bringing former East German spies to book.</p>
<p>"The supreme court can make the final decision on this," Portius told the court.</p>
<p>Normally former East German citizens can only be tried for breaking the laws of the former communist country, but in this case they were tried according to current federal law which punishes prevention of justice with up to five years' jail.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers in the case argued their clients did not dispute helping the retired guerrillas start a new life, but denied the charges, saying their action helped ward off the greater evil of more potential guerrilla attacks.</p>
<p>But prosecutors, keen to nail the men who were once pitted against the West German authorities during the Cold War, argued that while the men's actions took place in former East Germany they had their effect in West Germany.</p>
<p>Some of the guerrillas were regarded as West Germany's most dangerous criminals.</p>
<p>Susanne Albrecht had been wanted for her part in the 1977 murder of banker Juergen Ponto, the chairman of Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt. Silke Maier-Witt and Monika Helbing were wanted in connection with the 1977 kidnapping and murder of Employers' Federation chief Hanns-Martin Schleyer.</p>
<p>The guerrillas were given refuge on orders from former Stasi chief Erich Mielke and witnesses testified that East German leader Erich Honecker knew of the operation.</p>
<p>The arrests of the ten guerrillas in summer 1990 shocked Germans on both sides of the Cold War divide.</p>
