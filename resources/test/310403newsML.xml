<p>Shenzhen's A and B share indices finished slightly higher in slow trading on Wednesday with light buying seen in counters likely to post solid results for last year, brokers said.</p>
<p>The B share index inched up 0.47 points or 0.33 percent to close at 142.45 on volume of 5.61 million shares worth HK$27.56 million compared with Tuesday's HK$52.12 million.</p>
<p>The A share index added 3.37 points or 1.00 percent to end at 341.88 as turnover shrank to 3.56 billion yuan from 4.36 billion yuan in the previous session.  </p>
<p>Despite the rises, most institutions remained on the sidelines waiting for fresh trading incentives, brokers said.</p>
<p>The indices are likely to continue to fluctuate in a narrow range this week, they added.</p>
<p>"Market sentiment was affected by rumours that Beijing was drafting measures to effectively prevent bank funds from flowing into the A share market," a trader said.</p>
<p>Property developer China Vanke was the biggest B share gainer and rose HK$0.14 or 2.63 percent to HK$5.46 on thin volume of 2,699 shares.  </p>
<p>Hotelier Dadonghai followed, jumping HK$0.09 or 2.54 percent to HK$3.64 on the session's second heaviest trade of 485,200 shares. Health Mineral Water rose HK$0.10 or 2.20 percent to HK$4.64 with 71,200 shares changing hands.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Properties, the worst performer, declined HK$0.05 or 1.28 percent to HK$3.85. Changan Automobile traded the most on volume of 573,000 shares and inched down HK$0.01 to HK$4.48.</p>
<p>On the A share market, power generator maker Mindong Electric surged 0.51 yuan or 8.43 percent to 6.56 yuan on speculative buying.  </p>
<p>Hainan Minyuan advanced 1.11 yuan or 5.36 percent to 21.80 yuan on the most active trade of 13.51 million shares due to investor optimism over the conglomerate's business results last year, brokers said.</p>
