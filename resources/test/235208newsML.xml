<p>The French government on Wednesday called off the controversial sale of electronics group Thomson SA in a major policy U-turn after weeks of staunchly defending its choice of buyer.</p>
<p>It was the second privatisation to be halted in less than a month after a decision to suspend the sale of state-owned bank CIC.</p>
<p>It comes at a time when Prime Minister Alain Juppe, at a record low in opinion polls, is anxious to avoid another labour revolt following last month's truckers stoppage.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry said in a statement the suspension of the proposed Thomson sell-off to Lagardere Groupe was due to objections to the planned sale of the company's consumer electronics unit to South Korea's Daewoo Electronics.</p>
<p>But the office of Prime Minister Alain Juppe said renewed talks about the sale could start soon.</p>
<p>"The government will launch consultations as rapidly as possible allowing the privatisation to take place on a basis that will be defined very quickly," Juppe was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>"The aim of privatising Thomson addresses the necessity for France to have an electronics and defence industry of global standing," he said.</p>
<p>Industry Minister Franck Borotra said in a statement the privatisation of Thomson remained essential</p>
<p>"The goal of privatisation of Thomson, and in particular TMM (Thomson Multimedia), remains essential for the future of the company," Borotra said.</p>
<p>"TMM needs to cuts its debt, enter new markets and improve its competitiveness in order to better exploit its technological and human resources," he added.</p>
<p>Several thousand workers of Thomson Multimedia marched in Paris and other cities on November 20 to protest against a sale to a booming Asian competitor, fearing for their jobs and working conditions.</p>
<p>Staff were also enraged by Juppe telling parliament in October their hi-tech company was worthless. The prime minister said the company was "worth not even a franc, it is worth 14 billion francs of debt."</p>
<p>The government said in October it had picked Lagardere because it was best for French defence interests and would sell the heavily indebted company for a symbolic one franc after a 10.8 billion franc ($2 billion) state capital injection.</p>
<p>Lagardere planned to merge Thomson's 58-percent owned defence electronics unit Thomson-CSF with its own Matra Defense Espace.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry's surprise suspension announcement came on the day the European Commission had been expected to give the green light to the deal.</p>
<p>The ministry said the Privatisation Commission "declared itself incapable of giving a favourable opinion to the Lagardere Groupe offer, because of the terms of Daewoo Electronics' purchase of Thomson Multimedia."</p>
<p>It added the companies could continue their discussions with the Privatisation Commission and the state would pursue talks with the European Commission about conditions for a capital increase, on which Brussels had expressed reservations.</p>
<p>Shares in Lagardere and Thomson-CSF were suspended, while those of Alcatel fell three percent with investors expecting the group to make a new bid that could create uncertainties about the financing and its own profit recovery.</p>
<p>Lagardere said in a statement it was still interested in taking over Thomson, which it said was of strategic importance. A spokesman for Alcatel Alsthom said only that the company "took note" of the decision.</p>
<p>"The chances (for Alcatel) have got to be increased by this, if they can come up with a different offer," said a Paris share broker, adding the decision was a blow to the government's standing. "It doesn't look good for the French government."</p>
<p>Alcatel chairman Serge Tchuruk recently said he was ready to make a new offer for Thomson, breaking weeks of silence after French newspapers suggested Chirac might have been influenced by a disputed report of British plans to take over the company.</p>
<p>Britain's GEC has said it is willing to talk about a cooperation deal with whoever wins Thomson.</p>
