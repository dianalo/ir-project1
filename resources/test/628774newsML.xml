<p>The jurors in the Oklahoma City bombing trial were set to begin their second day of deliberations on Saturday, weighing the strengths and weaknesses of the evidence against accused Timothy McVeigh.</p>
<p>The jury of seven men and five women put in nearly a full day of deliberations on Friday before Federal Judge Richard Matsch told them to put the case out of their minds for the evening and come back fresh in the morning.</p>
<p>There was no indication how long the jury would take to reach a verdict.</p>
<p>Jurors, who have heard 137 prosecution and 25 defence witnesses, were not allowed to take notes during the trial and will be working from memory. But evidence from the case was set up in an auxiliary courtroom so jurors could view it.</p>
<p>McVeigh is charged in the April 19, 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah federal building in Oklahoma City  which killed 168 people. If convicted he faces the death penalty.</p>
<p>Relatives of people who perished in the bombing were going through a tense period as they waited for the verdict.</p>
<p>Marsha Kight, who lost a 23-year-old daughter in the bombing, said she was on an "emotional rollercoaster" and felt powerless. "I wish I could crawl into their minds and see what they're thinking," Kight said of the jurors.</p>
<p>But when Matsch put the high-profile case in the hands of the jury, he reminded them: "The law does not permit jurors to be governed by sympathy, prejudice or public opinion. You're expected to carefully and impartially consider all the evidence, follow the law as stated by the court and reach a just verdict."</p>
<p>The prosecution portrayed the 29-year-old Gulf War veteran as a right-wing fanatic, driven to carry out the bombing by his hate for the government over the way federal agents handled a siege at the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993.</p>
<p>The defence has argued that authorities arrested the wrong man. The defence team, led by Stephen Jones, tried to discredit key prosecution witnesses, attack the reliability of the government's scientific evidence and undermine eyewitnesses who claimed McVeigh was the man who rented the Ryder truck the government says was used in the bombing.</p>
<p>The case moved along faster than anyone had expected, in part because Matsch kept firm control of the proceedings.</p>
<p>"He has been moving the trial along and insisting on decorum in the courtroom," said Andrew Cohen, a Denver attorney monitoring the case.</p>
<p>Jurors are sequestered and have been repeatedly admonished by Matsch to avoid all publicity on the case. On Friday he reminded them that "deliberations take place in the courthouse and nowhere else."</p>
