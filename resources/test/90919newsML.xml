<p>A record number of Brazilian congressmen, lured by swelling city budgets and dreams of furthering their political careers, are running for mayor in local elections on Thursday.</p>
<p>Hometown campaigning by 123 lawmakers, or 20 percent of Brazilian congressmen, has virtually shut down the capital of Brasilia in the past two months.</p>
<p>The unusual migration of Brazilian politicians from the national to the local political arena is due mostly to constitutional changes in 1988 that gave cities a bigger chunk of federal revenue.</p>
<p>Political analysts say the changes have raised the political stakes for controlling city hall, a fact that has not been overlooked by national leaders.</p>
<p>"Large budgets and prospects for even bigger budgets in 1997 and 1998 have definitely attracted congressmen" to the local races, said David Fleischer, a political analyst in Brasilia. "This route is increasingly making sense for young congressmen hoping to become state governor or return to Brasilia."</p>
<p>Taking control of hefty city budgets gives mayors the chance to build strategic local power bases which can then be used to relaunch themselves on to the national political scene.</p>
<p>Despite their high profile and fund-raising expertise, federal lawmakers are in no way guaranteed mayoral seats this week. In fact, at least half of the 115 lower house members and eight senators contesting local offices are expected to come up empty-handed on Thursday.</p>
<p>Even so, analysts say lawmakers have little to lose.</p>
<p>Congressmen retain their seats in Brasilia while carrying out local campaigns, so there is no risk of falling off the political stage. Also, running a local campaign puts congressmen back in touch with their constituencies and encourages them to explore new political alliances.</p>
<p>Brazil watchers say this has been the strategy of Rio de Janeiro congressmen Miro Teixeira -- a leading figure of the Brazilian left in the lower house -- who is contesting Rio's highly coveted mayoral seat even though his chances are slim.</p>
<p>Winners will take hold of ballooning municipal budgets that are expected to grow even further in 1997 when cities get a bigger slice of federal emergency funds.</p>
<p>The winner of the hotly contested race in the nation's sprawling metropolis of Sao Paulo, for example, will preside over a $6 billion annual budget.</p>
<p>Mayors elected this year also could benefit by two constitutional amendments on the drawing board in Brasilia. One would allow executive officer holders, from the president of the republic to small town mayors, to be re-elected.</p>
<p>The other would permit government to fire public workers. Slashing public payrolls, now about 90 percent of municipal expenditures, would make it easier for mayors to deliver on campaign promises by freeeing up more of the budget for pork barrel projects.</p>
