<p>A senior British member of the European Parliament defended Britain's handling of the health crisis over mad cow disease on Monday, saying Britain had not failed to mark cattle moving from one herd to another.</p>
<p>"I have been marking cows since I was in short trousers and I know that they mark the cattle in Britain," Lord Henry Plumb, a Conservative and European Parliament President from 1987 to 1989, told a key parliamentary committee of inquiry.</p>
<p>He said that Britain had had difficulty in reacting to the crisis, which exploded when the British government said bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) could be transmitted to humans.</p>
<p>But he said after a slow start the British government took all the necessary measures.</p>
<p>The committee gave deputies until next Monday to submit amendments to the committee's draft report, which has said the British government had failed to enforce properly a ban on animal-feed exports containing meat and bone-meal.</p>
<p>The report, commissioned after the crisis over BSE, which came to a head last year when the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports, also criticises the European Commission for delaying the release of data on BSE.</p>
<p>It said this helped to undermine public confidence and worsen the economic damage.</p>
<p>Even though the report does not recommend any sanctions againt the Commission, a number of deputies, including Green members, restated at Monday's committee meeting their demand for the Commission to be censored for its performance in the mad cow disease crisis if it did not change its ways.</p>
<p>European Commission President Jacques Santer will have a last chance on Wednesday to explain the executive's performance when he speaks before the committee of inquiry.</p>
<p>Commission officials have been unwilling to comment on the report, saying it may yet be amended. But the Commission has in the past denied allegations of mismanagement.</p>
<p>The report follows a four-month investigation by the 19-member cross-party committee of inquiry.</p>
