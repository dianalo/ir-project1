<p>More than 2.4 million Arab and Western tourists visited Syria in 1996, spending around $1 billion, Syrian tourism minister said.</p>
<p>Danhu Daoud told Reuters in an interview that Syria expected the number of tourists per year to reach three million in the near future and that it has started setting up plans and agreements to develop the industry.</p>
<p>"The number of tourists and visitors by the end of this year will be around 2.43 million which is a good increase of around eight percent from the 1995 figure of 2.25 million," Daoud said.</p>
<p>"Depending on this rate we expect the number of tourists to increase to three million in the near future."</p>
<p>Daoud said Syria was seeking to improve tourism through investment projects, festivals, exhibitions and bilateral cooperation agreements with Arab and foreign countries.</p>
<p>"We have given 37 licences for various touristic projects in different places in Syria and our projects in 1997 will be more than that," he said.</p>
<p>Syria signed in 1996 a tourism cooperation agreement with Algeria and an agreement with the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to prepare a study for a national plan to develop tourism until the year 2015.</p>
<p>JICA will provide the study as a technical aid by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>The study includes a general survey and evaluation of the touristic spots and a report setting priorities according to regional and international demands and to the investment possibilities.</p>
<p>JICA official in Damascus, Anwar Bariz, said Syria has "good touristic qualities...and the Middle East is heading towards an era of economic development so tourism should be improved to be a strong support to the countries' economic development".</p>
<p>"The study will be a start for a fruitful cooperation between JICA and the Syrian tourism ministry. The Japanese are keen to be the side that provides the study because that would help them set the basis for any possible future investments," he said.</p>
<p>Statistics of the tourism ministry showed that tourists from Arab Gulf countries, Lebanon and Jordan were over 1.4 million this year.</p>
<p>Tourists from France, Germany, Italy, Russia, Britain, Iran, Turkey and the United States were over 500,000 for the same period.</p>
<p>The statistics also showed that the number of tourists from the United States and Canada increased by 32 percent in 1996 in comparison with 1995 and British tourists by 37 percent.</p>
<p>Saudi tourists increased by 30 percent, the United Arab Emirates by 17 percent and Kuwait by seven percent.</p>
<p>Head of the exhibition department at the tourism ministry M'utaz Daghstani said Syria usually addreses the demands of Arab tourists before other tourists.</p>
<p>He said Syria in cooperation with JICA will study developing winter tourism in the mountains to attract Europeans in addition to the archeological, religious and summer attractions which are currently known in Syria.</p>
