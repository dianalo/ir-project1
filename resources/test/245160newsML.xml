<p>Indonesia's parliament on Monday passed the country's first broadcasting bill aimed at protecting the domestic industry and regulating broadcasts on all media, including the Internet.</p>
<p>"We did not have a broadcasting bill before. I expect this one to provide a better environment for the broadcasting community," Abu Hasana Sazili, chairman of the parliamentary committee on the broadcasting bill, told Reuters.</p>
<p>President Suharto must now sign the bill into law, but no date has been set.</p>
<p>Parliament, which had been expected to pass the bill in October, extended debate to take into account new technologies and media such as the Internet, cable television and other multi-media applications, Sazili said.</p>
<p>If the Internet were used as a broadcast medium, it would fall under the bill, he explained.</p>
<p>The draft bill, submitted to parliament by the government in March, had covered mainly radio, television and advertising.</p>
<p>Sazili said the new law would also allow the state-owned television station Televisi Republik Indonesia (TVRI) to carry selected advertising, such as public service advertising.</p>
<p>TVRI would not be allowed to carry product advertising and thus would not be in direct competition with the country's five privately owned television stations, he said.</p>
<p>Sazili denied earlier media reports that the government had bowed to pressure from privately owned stations not to allow TVRI to carry advertising.</p>
<p>Relatives of President Suharto control three of the privately owned stations, Rajawali Citra Televisi (RCTI), Televisi Pendidikan Indonesia (TPI) and Surya Citra Televisi (SCTV). Well-connected businessmen control the other two.</p>
<p>Sazili said the new law would provide stronger protection for the domestic broadcasting industry against foreign competitors because the local players were considered weaker in areas such as technology.</p>
<p>The bill stipulated that broadcast advertising should be produced by firms licensed by the government, using Indonesian locations, Indonesian artists and Indonesian production partners. Advertisements by foreign firms should follow the spirit of the bill, he said.</p>
<p>Indonesia's advertising market was likely to continue to its rapid growth in coming years, said a report by London-based Zenith Media in October.</p>
<p>About $668 million was spent on television advertising in 1995, a 29 percent increase from 1994. That should rise to $770 million in 1996 and $1.5 billion by 2001, at constant 1995 prices, it said.</p>
