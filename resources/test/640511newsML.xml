<p>Ireland's official external reserves fell by 1.13 billion punts to 4.74 billion punts in April, the central bank said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Foreign-exchange market intervention was the main factor affecting reserves combined with interest and principal payments on the exchequer foreign debt, the central bank said.</p>
<p>"These factors exceeded EU receipts and a write-up of 151 million in Irish pound value of the OER's (Official External Reserves), reflecting the change in value of the Irish pound," the central bank said.</p>
<p>It said Net External Liability (NEL)of all credit institutions fell by 1.87 billion punts and net forward sales of foreign currency by resident banks contributed substantially to this development.</p>
<p>The central bank said a money-market shortage rose in April due principally to the impact of foreign exchange market interventions.</p>
<p>"At end-April, the Bank was providing support of 1.34 billion, up from 199 million at end-March, it said. "Most of the increase in support was supplied through sale and repurchase agreements with a small amount provided through the Short Term Facility.  </p>
<p>The central bank said Irish pound credit to the government increased marginally, as an increase in holdings of government bonds by credit institutions was offset by reduced holdings of Exchequer notes.</p>
<p>Non-resident holdings of Irish government securities rose by 51 million in April, having fallen in the previous two months, it said.</p>
<p>The Bank said government domestic transactions broadly offset each other, but payments on the Exchequer foreign debt exceeded EU receipts.</p>
<p>"Reflecting these factors, government balances at the central bank fell by 98 million punts."</p>
