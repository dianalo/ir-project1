<p>A call from the BBC for Britons to pay more for its services received a frosty response on Saturday from politicans and media industry figures.</p>
<p>BBC Director-General John Birt said on Friday that the television licence fee should be increased above the level of inflation to protect what he called "the most successful cultural institution in the world".</p>
<p>Speaking at the Edinburgh International Television Festival, Birt said the first increase in real terms since 1985 was needed to help fund an expansion of services in the digital era.</p>
<p>But the ruling Conservative party and opposition Labour are reluctant to endorse a rise in the run-up to a general election due by next May.</p>
<p>"To ask for a big increase now is out of the question," The Times quoted a government source as saying. The newspaper said Conservative strategists believed a big rise would be political suicide.</p>
<p>Labour broadcasting spokesman Lewis Moonie said the BBC should seek to boost its revenue from commercial activities.</p>
<p>The annual fee, fixed by the government and payable by all owners of television sets, is 89.50 pounds. Licence income totals 1.8 billion pounds each year -- 95 percent of BBC revenue.</p>
<p>The fee funds the BBC's two television channels plus its five national and 38 local radio services.</p>
<p>The government is due to review the licence fee in the next few months but any increase would not take effect until April 1, 1997. The fee has been pegged to inflation since 1988.</p>
<p>BBC executives stress they are seeking a "modest" rise, in low percentage figures above the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>Patricia Hodgson, the BBC's Director of Policy and Planning, said that the timing of the review was awkward politically but said action was needed.</p>
<p>"It is not a good time to talk about the challenges of funding the BBC over the next 10 years," she said on Saturday.</p>
<p>"But we cannot reproduce the miracle of the past 10 years."</p>
<p>The BBC has cut 4,000 jobs over the past five years and now employs some 21,000 people.</p>
<p>It has committed itself to further cost savings and expansion of its commercial arm but says more money is needed to protect its status as "the touchstone of quality".</p>
<p>Digital television -- which will multiply the number of channels and allow the creation of interactive services such as home shopping -- is set to launch in Britain in 1997.</p>
<p>The BBC plans a new 24-hour news channel, additional programming and wide-screen transmission, all in digital form.</p>
<p>David Elstein, director of programming at satellite broadcaster BSkyB, questioned whether viewers would regard these services as justifying a higher licence fee.</p>
<p>He said that a compulsory licence fee would be outmoded when thousands of channels became available.</p>
<p>He argued that the licence fee should be made voluntary, with viewers given the option of not taking BBC services.</p>
