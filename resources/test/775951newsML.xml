<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-08-04</dateline>

<p>CME lumber futures were locked up the $10 per thousand board feet limit on the key September contract around midsession, boosted by commercial buying and light fund short covering, dealers said.</p>
<p>A Canadian holiday kept volume thin and limited selling interest.</p>
<p>"At least half the natural sellers are on holiday," one dealer said.</p>
<p>They noted R.B. and H. Financial Services were a featured buyer of September in what may have been commercial activity while Cargill Investor Services were a light buyer with their interest possibly fund related.</p>
<p>Cash trade was slow. Last week's Slocan Forest Products Ltd announcement it would close mills one week of downtime remained a background supportive influence.</p>
<p>At 1140 CDT September lumber futures were up the $10.00 per thousand board feet limit, bid at $356.90 per tbf. Other months were $8.50 to $3.80 higher.</p>
