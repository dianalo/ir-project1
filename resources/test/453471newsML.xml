<p>Global fish oil output is expected to remain steady over the next five years at about 1.20 million tonnes per annum, said Stuart Barlow, director general of the International Fishmeal &amp; Oil Manufacturers Assocation.</p>
<p>Demand should fall short of supply by the year 2001 at 1.16 million, he told the Lipidex 97 oilseeds conference.</p>
<p>"From the above scenario we are unlikely to see significant increases in fish oil price ratios against competing vegetable oils," Barlow said.</p>
<p>Origin countries such as Chile, Peru and Mexico would increase their traditional consumption of fish oil, he said.</p>
<p>This may or may not offset expected consumption falls from a shift in the key consuming European market towards vegetable based margarines rather than margarine using partially hydrogenated fish oil.</p>
<p>Consumption in this area had been hit by claims this solidifying process produces high levels of trans fatty acids, which are just as harmful in raising cholesterol levels as the saturated fats found in butter, lard and palm oil.</p>
<p>The industry was exploring alternative uses such as in technical-pharmaceutical applications and fish oil should remain favoured in bakery products where its creaming properties are desirable, Barlow said.</p>
<p>Unknown quantities were the future demand from the former Soviet Union and the expanding Chinese aquaculture industry.</p>
<p>On the supply side, Barlow said less fish should be available for fish meal and oil production because fish catches were expected to fall amid pressure to sustain stocks.</p>
<p>Currently, two thirds of all catches are for human consumption, leaving one third for oil and meal but relatively more fish would be demanded for direct consumption in future.</p>
<p>To make up for the loss, Ifoma had joined pressure groups calling for a ban on the growing practice by fishing fleets to discard fish at sea when they are already dead, rather than landing them on shore and processing them.</p>
<p>Barlow said the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) estimated the discards amounted to 27 million tonnes, about one third of total catches.</p>
