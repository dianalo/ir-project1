<p>Congressional negotiators have narrowed differences between House and Senate bills that deal with broadcasters' obligation to return analog television licenses after the transition to digital TV, a House aide said Thursday.</p>
<p>Negotiators from the House and Senate Commerce Committee were meeting Thursday evening to resolve the differences. Any compromise language is meant to be included in balanced-budget legislation hammered out by House and Senate lawmakers.  </p>
<p>"We've made substantial progress in resolving the issue of the analog giveback by broadcasters," said Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Rep. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R-La.). Tauzin chairs the House Subcommittee on Telecommunications.</p>
<p>"Neither the Senate language or the House language will emerge intact," said Johnson, adding that the negotiators were trying to meet on the "high road." He declined to give details.</p>
<p>Both chambers of Congress last month passed budget bills that critics charge would allow broadcaters to avoid key commitments they made in exchange for free digital licenses.  </p>
<p>The House legislation would let TV stations keep their current analog licenses beyond 2006 if 5 percent of their audience relies exclusively on existing over-the-air analog signals.</p>
<p>Recent Federal Communication Colmmission rules require the licenses to be returned by the year 2006. The licenses are supposed to be auctioned for other purposes in 2002.</p>
<p>The House bill would give the FCC the discretion to extend the 2006 deadline if the 5 percent figure is met.  </p>
<p>The Senate legislation would allow broadcasters to keep their analog licenses beyond 2006 -- but only in cities where less than 95 percent of the viewers have "access" to digital TV signals.</p>
<p>The measure was considered less favorable for broadcasters than the House language, because viewers could get access to digital signals through a variety of technologies -- such as cable TV, set-top converters or satellite TV.</p>
<p>In a letter this week to House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt voiced displeasure with both pieces of legislation.</p>
<p>He said that the term "access" needs to be better defined in the Senate language "so no one can later argue that this provision is ambiguous. Any ambiguity surrouding 'access' could tie up the analog spectrum indefinitely."</p>
<p>Hundt called the five-percent figure in the House language "unrealistic."</p>
<p>"If one looks at telephone penetration, telephones have been available for 120 years and yet six percent of the population still does not have a telephone," he wrote.</p>
