<title>JAPAN: Toyota suspends production due to fire.</title>

<p>A weekend fire at a car parts supplier forced Japanese car giant Toyota Motor Corp. to suspend most of its domestic production for Tuesday.</p>
<p>The accident cast a spotlight on Toyota's famous "just in time" production system, which in the best of times boosts production efficiency by notches.</p>
<p>Analysts said Monday that Toyota's strategy for parts makers to supply parts just prior to assembly instead of keeping them in storage backfired by causing a serious parts crunch.</p>
<p>A fire at Toyota group company Aisin Seiki Co. Ltd on Saturday halted output of brake parts supplied to Toyota, forcing it to announce the closure of all but one domestic plants for a full day on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Aisin, which ships about 90 percent of its products to Toyota, said it would be unable to supply some brake-related products because it had no alternative production facility.</p>
<p>Hideaki Aonuma, an industry analyst at Societe Generale Securities, said despite the crisis, Toyota was good at managing risks and would ask its other group companies to provide the necessary car parts.</p>
<p>Toyota, which usually produces about 14,000 cars per day at its 12 plants in Japan, closed one factory in Kyushu, southern Japan, on Monday. Its production plan after Tuesday will be decided later, a Toyota spokesman said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Toyota's overseas production would not be affected by the suspension.</p>
<p>Toyota officials declined to estimate any likely damage from the suspension, but private analysts believe Toyota's bottom line will not suffer any major ill effects.</p>
