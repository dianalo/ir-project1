<p>Bulgaria's Finance Ministry will offer on Friday an issue of 3-year, floated coupon T-notes with a par value of 35 billion levs, the central bank said.</p>
<p>The issue is offered with no minimum acceptable price set in advance.</p>
<p>The coupon of the issue equals the central bank's main interest rate for the period to maturity and changes every time the rate is changed.</p>
<p>The main interest rate is now set at 9.76 percent annually.</p>
<p>The central bank also said the finance ministry had cut the share of non-competitive bids to five percent of the total par value from 30 percent previously.</p>
<p>A Finance Ministry official said this would allow banks to place more funds through competitive orders, which are approved on the basis of the prices offered, unlike non-competitive bids approved according to the time they were placed.</p>
<p>The price of non-competitive bids is equal to the average price of the competitive bids approved.</p>
