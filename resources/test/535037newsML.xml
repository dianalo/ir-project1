<p>Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd said on Thursday it had no immediate plans to cut jobs at its Vaal Reefs Exploration and Mining Co unit.</p>
<p>"No retrenchments are immediately contemplated although some redeployment of employees at No 3 shaft is likely," Anglo said.</p>
<p>Earlier Vaal Reefs mine manager David Fisher had said the mine would have to make major job cuts.</p>
<p>"We will have to investigate compulsory retrenchments...we will have to make fairly significant reductions," Fisher said a presentation.</p>
<p>Anglo said that if productivity could be improved, retrenchment would not be necessary.</p>
<p>Vaal Reefs produced 16,022 kg of gold in the three months to end-March.</p>
