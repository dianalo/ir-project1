<p>Petrolite Corp said Wednesday its board of directors postponed the annual meeting scheduled for March 3, citing the ongoing process of exploring a possible sale or merger of the company.</p>
<p>Petrolite did not indicate when the meeting would be rescheduled.  It said a sale or merger of the company could require a vote of all stockholders.  </p>
<p>In November, the company said it formed a special committee last June to explore possible business combinations. It said there were concerns its largest shareholder, Wm. S. Barnickel &amp; Co was considering a sale or merger of the company and would go through with it without "regard to whether maximum shareholder value can be realized".</p>
<p>Petrolite, a specialty chemical company, said in November that it rejected two expressions of interest -- one that indicated a value of at least $40 a share and another in the range of $40 to $44 a share, calling the proposals "clearly inadequate".  </p>
<p>The company said it focused on the implementation of a strategic plan throughout 1996 to reverse disappointing results of recent years.</p>
<p>"(W)e believe we have enhanced the outlook for future performance gains," Paul Hatfield, Petrolite chairman, said in a statement. "Improvements to date have been significant."</p>
<p>Petrolite said it projected 1997 fiscal first quarter earnings would improve 20 percent or more compared with the fourth quarter of 1996. The company reported earnings for the fourth quarter ended October 31 of $0.54 a share versus a loss of $0.60 a share the previous year.</p>
<p>"We are confident we will exceed this earlier indication as the company's year-to-year improvement continues to be solid," Hatfield said.</p>
<p>Shares of Petrolite traded up 3/4 at 47-1/4.</p>
