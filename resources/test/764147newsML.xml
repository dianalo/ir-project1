<p>European bunker prices firmed on Tuesday with substantial buying in the Mediterranean, dealers said.</p>
<p>Rotterdam bunkers were around $92/$93 fob as the barge market pushed up to as high as $92 ex wharf. Some traders said the strength resulted from product shortages.</p>
<p>Trading volume was low. One large enquiry for 10,000 tonnes emerged in the morning, but suppliers said the buyer only took 4,000 tonnes by the close of business.</p>
<p>Total ARA volume was around 10,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices were steady after sharp increases last week. Some short-term tightness persisted.</p>
<p>Mediterranean fuel oil prices mostly firmed by $1 and gas oil by $2 a tonne. Suppliers in all ports reported healthy business.</p>
<p>Greek supply was again hit, this time by problems at a refinery in the north of the country. Earlier this month, bunker fuel shortages were caused by maintenance at a refinery further south.</p>
<p>"We can only get it drop by drop," one supplier said.</p>
