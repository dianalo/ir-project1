<p>Eight Egyptians and two Sudanese went on trial in a military court in the southern city of Assiut on Saturday on charges of smuggling weapons and ammunition from Sudan, security sources said.</p>
<p>They said five of the men, including the two Sudanese, are being tried in absentia. The army says the men had planned to sell the arms in Egypt.</p>
<p>The sources said the men smuggled 46 Kalashkinov rifles and more than five thousands rounds across the border earlier this year.</p>
<p>Armed forces border guards seized the cache in August in Qena province, further south.</p>
<p>The sources said the men were weapons smugglers and not members of Moslem militant groups that are waging a low-level guerrilla war against Egyptian authorities in southern Egypt.</p>
<p>The men are being tried in a military court because they were arrested by the military's border guards.</p>
<p>Military courts have over the past few years been used to try civilians who were charged with belonging to militant groups trying to overthrow the Egyptian government.</p>
