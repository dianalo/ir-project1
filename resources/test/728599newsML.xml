<title>CROATIA: Croatian stocks close mixed, Pliva in demand.</title>
<headline>Croatian stocks close mixed, Pliva in demand.</headline>
<dateline>ZAGREB 1997-07-15</dateline>
<text>
<p>Croatian stocks closed mixed with drugs firm Pliva playing a starring role amid very strong market activity on Tuesday and traders said the company's shares could be in demand throughout the summer.</p>
<p>Pliva sold 25,005 shares on Tuesday -- the biggest volume recorded this year. It closed at 512 kuna, up 28 from last Thursday when it last traded.</p>
<p>"I suspect that good results for the first six months have been leaked and that there are some good expectations for the firm's future," said Nenad Pavletic of Auctor brokerage.</p>
<p>"I think that summer will not affect either Pliva's price or the volume of trading," he said.</p>
<p>Other traders said Pliva's strong performance in Zagreb was influenced by the rise of its Global Depository Receipts (GDRs) in London. They fetched $16.325 by Tuesday afternoon, after opening at $16.1.</p>
<p>Total volume was ten times higher at 37,037 shares, and turnover rose to 18.8 million kuna from Friday's meagre 1.5 million.</p>
<p>However Pliva's strong performance failed to pull the rest of the market up and out of 18 active issues four rose, eight fell and six were flat.</p>
<p>Traders speculated the heavy trading might not last long and expect the summer lull to set in toward the end of July.</p>
<p>However, Pavletic said some liquid stocks, such as brewery Karlovacka Pivovara and Zagrebacka Banka could rise slightly in the days ahead.</p>
<p>Zagrebacka fell on Tuesday, shedding 44.90 kuna to 1,970.10, with 1,310 shares traded. Karlovacka brewery, which was the market's darling some two weeks ago, rose 10 kuna to 540 on volume of 526 shares.</p>
<p>Ship repair company Viktor Lenac, which listed its shares on the Zagreb bourse on Tuesday becoming the fourth fully-listed company, did not trade at all.</p>
<p>Top gainer cement factory Nasicecement added 55 kuna or 14.1 percent to 445 kuna on volume of 3,820 shares. The stock made its market debut in early July when it last traded and traders said it could be poised for further growth.</p>
<p>The biggest decliner shipper Atlantska Plovidba lost 10 kuna or 5.9 percent to 160, selling 186 shares.</p>
<p>Food processor Podravka edged down six kuna to 250 kuna, with 2,700 units changing hands.</p>
