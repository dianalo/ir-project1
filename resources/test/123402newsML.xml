<p>Mexico's same-day peso closed five centavos firmer at 7.7420/7.7500 on Thursday due to pre-weekend swaps and dollars flowing back into a calmer market, traders said.</p>
<p>"It's a lot calmer today...it seems that the hurricane has finally died down," said a trader. "Dealers felt like selling (dollars) when they saw the market was calmer."</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso and the 24-hour contract reversed their early weakness to meanwhile stand 1.5 and 2.9 centavos firmer, respectively, at 7.7625/7.7700 and 7.7475/7.7550 per dollar.</p>
