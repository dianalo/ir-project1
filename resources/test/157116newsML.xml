<headline>German stocks close bourse down at four-week low.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-10-31</dateline>

<p>The German DAX index of 30 leading shares on Thursday ended thin-volume bourse trade at its lowest level in four weeks as the possibility of further German interest rate cuts faded and Wall Street closed lower.</p>
<p>German rate cut hopes were knocked on Wednesday, when Britain announced a rise in its base interest rate, but the move came just before the close of floor dealings and the market did not have time to react fully.</p>
<p>The DAX index closed floor dealings down 19.48 points, or 0.73 percent, at 2,659.25.</p>
<p>But in post-bourse computer dealings, the IBIS DAX recovered some ground after Wall Street opened slightly firmer and U.S. Treasuries were encouraged by data showing higher-than-expected jobless claims.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX ended up 6.68 points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,671.40.</p>
<p>Overall, dealers said the market tone was mixed, with interest mainly focused on individual stocks. They said volumes on Friday were likely to be thin, because of a public holiday in several German states.</p>
<p>The banking sector was the day's main centre of attention as nine month results were released.</p>
<p>Dresdner Bank, which had risen in early IBIS dealings after it said its operating profits rose 29.7 percent to 1.89 billion marks for the first nine months of the year, ended computer trade down 19 pfennigs at 40.50 marks.</p>
<p>Shares in business software company SAP AG fell on continued worries about the firm, after it issued a profit warning last week. Preference shares in the company ended IBIS down 6.20 marks, or three percent, at 198.70 marks.</p>
<p>Dealers said SAP could continue to attract attention as analysts downgraded expectations for the company.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some dealers said German carmaker Volkswagen had stepped into SAP's former position as market favourite, with several investment banks upgrading their forecasts for the company, following upbeat nine month results last week.</p>
<p>VW shares rose 8.40 marks, or over one percent, to 606.40 marks in IBIS trade, after investment bank Merrill Lynch named the company its "Global Focus One" stock.</p>
