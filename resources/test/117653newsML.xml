<p>The head of India's new divestment commission said on Tuesday that foreign lead managers were pushing for the quick sale of partial stakes in state-owned companies, but it was first necessary to overhaul the firms.</p>
<p>Disinvestment Commission Chairman G.V. Ramakrishna told Reuters in an interview that foreign lead managers were interested in earning fees from the sale of partial stakes.</p>
<p>"They are taking a narrow view of the matter. They want quick disinvestment," he said, adding that foreign lead managers were not concerned over the price at which the shares were sold.</p>
<p>Ramakrishna said the government would fetch a higher price if the financial viability, management skills and technological capability of the state-owned firms were strengthened before any sell-off.</p>
<p>"You should prepare the public sector undertakings properly before selling off the shares," he said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's centre-left government established the Disinvestment Commission, part of the Industry Ministry, in August to oversee the partial privatisation, or disinvestment, of state units.</p>
<p>India aims to raise 50 billion rupees from disinvestment in 1996/97 (April-March).</p>
<p>Last week the commission held discussions with merchant bankers, financial institutions, academics and domestic and foreign credit rating agencies over the pricing of shares.</p>
<p>"To enhance the value of the shares you should prepare the value of the undertakings properly. Give them good corporate governance, look at their technical strength and improve their marketing capability," he said.</p>
<p>He said about the government had invested some $75 billion in about 245 state-owned units and it must get find ways to obtain a fair return on the sale of any shares.</p>
<p>Last month the government announced that it planned to sell a seven pct stake in Videsh Sanchar Nigam Limited (VSNL), and a five percent stake in the Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).</p>
<p>The exact dates of the first round of divestment have not yet been announced. A second round is expected to follow soon after the IOC and VSNL stakes are sold.</p>
<p>The Disinvestment Commission is not responsible for the first two rounds, but will take charge starting with an eventual third tranche.</p>
<p>Currently the panel is analysing 40 state-owned units for a third round of asset sales, expected to get underway next February.</p>
<p>Ramakrishna said that if the domestic stock market continued to be depressed, it would tap the global markets.</p>
