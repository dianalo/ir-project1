<p>A lone freighter searched for a Canadian yachtsman missing in rough seas on the fringes of Antarctica on Friday as Australia revelled in the dramatic rescue of two other round-the-world sailors.</p>
<p>The rescue of the pair -- Briton Tony Bullimore and Frenchman Thierry Dubois -- brought praise from Britain and an opportunity to smooth recent choppy relations with France.</p>
<p>However, as an Australian frigate headed back to port with Bullimore and Dubois aboard, French race organisers were coordinating a search for Canadian Gerry Roufs who is feared in trouble somewhere between South America and New Zealand.</p>
<p>In Paris, race officials said French solo sailor Isabelle Autissier, who had been directed to turn back to search for Roufs, had been told to give up the attempt after capsizing five times. Autissier was rescued two years ago by the Australian navy after her yacht capsized in a round-the-world race.</p>
<p>The Panamanian freighter Mas Enterprise, with a British skipper, was the only vessel searching the area, 2,300 nautical miles from any inhabited land and out of the range of rescue planes.</p>
<p>Bullimore and Dubois, having weathered the mountainous seas and gales of the Southern Ocean, now appear set to encounter a media storm when they arrive in Perth on Monday.</p>
<p>British media reports said Bullimore's family had employed an agent to help negotiate rival bids for rights to his story and there was talk of a possible movie deal.</p>
<p>"This is a great story in the annals of sailing," acting prime minister Tim Fischer said on Australian radio.</p>
<p>"I think it has been an Australian privilege to fulfil the role it has been obliged to fulfil," he said.</p>
<p>The successful four-day rescue operation is seen by some as a chance to improve Australia's sometimes squally relationship with France after rows over nuclear testing in the Pacific.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac praised Australia's efforts, singling out Australian ambassador John Spender at his New Year reception at the Elysee Palace. Prime Minister Alain Juppe voiced admiration for the courage and efficiency of Australian rescuers and said the French people would not forget.</p>
<p>British Prime Minister John Major, on a trip to India, offered his thanks to the Australian rescuers while Queen Elizabeth -- whom many Australians want to dump as the country's titular head of state -- also sent congratulations.</p>
<p>Dubois was plucked from a life raft by helicopter on Thursday. Bullimore, whose fate was unknown for five days, swam into the arms of rescuers from beneath his upturned yacht.</p>
<p>Both men ran into a storm on Sunday, capsizing in heavy seas about 60 miles apart some 1,400 miles southwest of the Australian coast.</p>
<p>The frigate Adelaide is due to return to Perth on Monday morning after refuelling at sea on Saturday. Members of Bullimore's family plan to fly out to meet him.</p>
<p>The 56-year-old survived in a small space in the upturned hull of his yacht Global Exide Challenger as search aircraft dropped microphones and noise-emitting devices into the water around his yacht to reassure him of their presence.</p>
<p>The former Royal Marine, who was treated for hypothermia and dehydration, has said he feels "born all over again" after his ordeal, an Australian newspaper reported on Friday.</p>
<p>"I've become more human. In these last six days I'm a different person," he was quoted as telling The Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>"I won't be so rude to people, not that I was, but I'll be much more of a gentleman and, equally, I'll listen to people a lot more," he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>"It was an incredible rescue, and I think it will probably go down in history," he said.</p>
<p>Dubois told France 2 television by radio he had been certain of dying but clung to life because he had not seen enough of it.</p>
<p>"I really tried to hang in there. I am only 29 and I felt it was a pity to call it a day without having seen much of life."</p>
