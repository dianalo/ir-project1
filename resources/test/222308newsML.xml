<p>London freight fixtures had a quiet day on Thursday with the U.S. market closed for Thanksgiving. But rates were showing fresh signs of weakening in the Atlantic and the Pacific.</p>
<p>The Baltic Freight Index (BFI) drifted down five points to 1,423 points.</p>
<p>There were no new US Gulf/Japan fixtures after recent trades done at $23 per tonne no combination, but traders said the key route could strengthen slightly early next week.</p>
<p>"We are expecting a 50 cents rise next week," said one.</p>
<p>Timecharter rates were disappointing for owners. Oinoussian Sky fixed at $12,500 and $240,000 bonus for the Far East by Goldbeam said to be for a USGulf/Japan trip.</p>
<p>Rates were previously in the $14-15 range, brokers said.</p>
<p>A few grain houses were looking for timecharter on US Gulf/Continent but otherwise the market was quiet. Demand was also shallow in US Gulf/Far East with not many Korean buyers around for mid-December.</p>
<p>"There are quite a lot of ships there chasing a few cargoes," said one.</p>
<p>Brokers said rates were generally steady in the Pacific but edging down in the Atlantic, except the USGulf/Japan.</p>
<p>On capers, a 120,000 dwt Sol was fixed for a Transatlantic voyage delivery Skaw Passero in December at $8,000 daily to Deiulemar which traders said confirmed the softer tone of prices. Searadiance was fixed at $13.50 from Roberts Bank to Lisbon.</p>
<p>Other reported Caper fixtures were BHP with Hay Port Rotterdam for mid-December at $12.95.</p>
<p>The Baltic Freight Exchange amended details of Hajin's fixture of the 1995 built Maria Bottiglieri 75,265 dwt which has been booked for Dec 14/22 delivery USGulf redelivery Far East at $14,000 daily plus $270,000 bonus.</p>
