<p>Taiwan's central bank said on Tuesday it would issue T$5 billion in two-month negotiable certificates of deposit later in the day.</p>
<p>Bids would close at 15.00 local time (0700 GMT), a central bank official said.</p>
<p>During a sustained stock rally in March and April, the central bank repeatedly issued NCDs, a move seen as aiming to keep a lid on the loose liquidity that many experts said had been fuelling what then was a sizzling stock market.</p>
