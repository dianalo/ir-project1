<p>The Bucharest stock exchange</p>

<p>renewed interest at lower-priced stocks. Most average prices,</p>
<p>volume and turnover drifted higher.</p>
<p>"After the price falls of the last sessions, investors</p>
<p>ended their waiting game and started buying," a trader said.</p>
<p>Gainers in average prices led decliners 15 to 11, with one</p>
<p>stock remaining unchanged. Some stocks also closed higher,</p>
<p>helped by deals made in late trading, brokers said.</p>
<p>Two unofficial indices, the VAB and the BIG, jumped by 2.7</p>
<p>and respectively 2.78 percent from the previous session. BIG</p>
<p>first-tier index was 3.13 percent at 2,666.88 points.</p>

<p>2.3 million and helped turnover rise by around two billion lei</p>
<p>to 6.7 billion.</p>
<p>Traders said they expected the market to extend its</p>
<p>recovery on Friday.</p>
<p>The first tier continued to attract strong interest, taking</p>
<p>82 percent of turnover and trading around two million shares.</p>
<p>Two high-caps gained on both average and closing quotes,</p>
<p>while the other two first-tier listings lost ground.</p>

<p>lei to close at 4,300 and fertiliser maker Azomures </p>
<p>ended 400 lei stronger at 2,500.</p>
<p>Chemical plant Oltchim and Terapia </p>
<p>pharmaceuticals shed 150 lei each to end at 2,250 and</p>
<p>respectively 5,350.</p>
<p>On the second tier, Policolor dye maker stayed in</p>
<p>demand. It traded more than 187,000 shares on turnover of 912.8</p>
<p>million lei, including a special deal. But it closed 600 lei</p>
<p>weaker at 4,500 in heavy supply. The special deal involved</p>
<p>53,823 shares worth a total 242.2 million lei.</p>
<p>Trading on the second tier was otherwise thin, with nine</p>
<p>stocks having no deal and two suspended.</p>
