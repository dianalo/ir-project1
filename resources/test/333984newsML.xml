<p>NYCE cotton futures recouped earlier losses and settled higher, lifted by mixed and steady buying throughout the afternoon, floor sources said.</p>
<p>Once the locals broke through stops around 75.00 cents a lb in March delivery, trade and light speculative buying emerged to carry the spot month to the day's highs.</p>
<p>Technical resistance at 75.30 and price fixing at the day's highs capped the rally. Traders pegged the next level of resistance at 75.50 cents for March cotton.</p>
<p>They said the market is likely to retrace gains Tuesday if there is no follow-through on the open.</p>
<p>Steady export business would support prices in the longer term, analysts said.</p>
<p>March ended up 0.66 at 75.26, traded 75.30 to 74.30. The back months settled 0.53 higher to 0.20 lower.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 7,500 lots.</p>
