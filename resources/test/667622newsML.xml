<title>GERMANY: No convictions in biggest German child sex trial.</title>
<headline>No convictions in biggest German child sex trial.</headline>

<p>The largest child sex abuse trial in German criminal history ended on Tuesday without a single conviction and the presiding judge accused a children's protection group of generating misleading information for the case.</p>
<p>The court in the central city of Mainz dismissed prosecution accusations of widespread abuse by 11 suspects in the last of three interrelated trials which began three years ago.</p>
<p>The verdict meant that all 24 adults originally charged with abusing 16 children between six months and eight years old in the town of Worms in the early 1990s had been cleared.</p>
<p>"Mass abuse in Worms never took place. That is the clear conclusion," Judge Hans Lorenz told the court.</p>
<p>He attacked one of the members of a child protection group which gathered evidence for the case, saying her questioning of the children had been highly suggestive.</p>
<p>"The children could say what they liked. Everything contributed to hardening the suspicion that they had been sexually abused," Lorenz said, adding that such groups were out of their depth when it came to criminal investigations.</p>
<p>"There is no question that these children are victims. They are victims of this trial and they are victims of those who meant well but acted badly," he said.</p>
<p>Lorenz said it was clear the children had not been abused by outsiders but he could not rule out that six of them had been abused within their own families, although this could not be proven.</p>
<p>All the suspects -- who were accused of abuse, organising child prostitution and filming their crimes -- were acquitted either because their innocence was conclusively proved or because there was insufficient evidence for a conviction.</p>
<p>The marathon series of trials, centring on two families and their friends, attracted widespread media attention in Germany.</p>
<p>In addition to the shocking nature of the alleged crimes, the case drew more headlines when the court became the first in Germany to allow a witness -- one of the children -- to testify by video from outside the courtroom.</p>
<p>The boy gave evidence while sitting at a table covered with a tablecloth decorated with fairy-tale characters in a room next to the court. His testimony was relayed on a large screen.</p>
