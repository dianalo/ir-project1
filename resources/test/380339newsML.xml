<p>Swiss police have seized 12 million Swiss francs ($8.2 million) in counterfeit notes, the country's biggest ever case of forged cash, prosecutors said on Friday.</p>
<p>The federal prosecutor's office announced the seizure but declined to give details before a news conference later in the day (1400 GMT) at which some of the fake notes will be presented.</p>
<p>"This is the biggest case of counterfeit money we have had so far," said a police official. The seizure was made by federal prosecutors and police from Zurich and two other cantons, or states.</p>
<p>Police said the fakes were 1,000 Swiss franc notes.</p>
<p>"The quality of the counterfeit money is very good," another official said. ($ = 1.455 Swiss Francs)</p>
