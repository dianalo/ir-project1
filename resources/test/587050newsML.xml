<p>Pakistan stocks were little changed at noon on Thursday in lacklustre trading as the country's weak economic fundamentals deterred investors and dealers said the index would be range-bound in the near-term.</p>
<p>"There is no action today. It is a dull and stagnant market," dealer Dawar Hasan said. "Investors are on the sidelines because of concerns about Pakistan's economy."</p>
<p>The index fell 0.74 points, or 0.05 percent, to 1,541.15 at noon. Losers led gainers 161 to 71. PTCL rose 0.25 rupee to 25.</p>
