<p>Madrid stocks jumped nearly two percent to close near record highs on Monday, buoyed by an EU stability pact, lower Spanish interest rates and good November inflation data, dealers said.</p>
<p>The general index rose 7.84 points or 1.94 percent to 410.97. The Ibex-35 was up 99.40 points or 2.14 percent to 4,750.39. Telefonica shares gained 60 pesetas to 2,935.</p>
<p>Dealers said a slight correction on Tuesday was possible although the medium-term outlook was still positive.</p>
<p>"The market has reacted to Friday's data, but the rise is somewhat exaggerated and it is not clear that we can go much higher in the short term," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said unusually heavy volume of 78 billion pesetas showed the rally was amply supported.</p>
