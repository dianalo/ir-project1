<p>South African Breweries Ltd, the world's fourth largest brewer, posted a 14 percent jump in half year profits on Wednesday, buoyed by its fast-growing international interests.</p>
<p>Earnings per share in the six months to end-September rose to 185.2 cents from 162.5 a year ago, beating analysts' forecasts of 167-182 cents.</p>
<p>The dividend was also increased 14 percent to 65 cents while group turnover was ahead 16 percent at 17.16 billion rand ($3.67 billion), as was attributable income at 553 million rand.</p>
<p>The firm's fast developing international beer division -- which extends across southern Africa, central and eastern Europe and China -- saw earnings up 26 percent.</p>
<p>However the company painted a gloomy picture of domestic market conditions, saying high interest rates would continue to undermine consumer confidence and strain disposable income. But it added it should still see real growth in earnings and dividends for the year as a whole.</p>
<p>The firm said an unusually cold winter had not prevented growth in the firm's beer operations which saw earnings rise 17 percent on a modest increase in sales.</p>
<p>Analysts had been nervous about the results as some of SAB's operations outside its beer businesses had been showing signs of faltering.</p>
<p>Lower-than-expected interim earnings reports from retailer Edgars Stores, Coca-Cola bottler ABI and glass-maker Plate Glass and Shatterprufe Industries Ltd were all seen cutting into SAB's bottom line.</p>
<p>SAB said a weakening in the South African economy over the period had seen private consumption spending fall and hit consumer-oriented businesses.</p>
<p>Deputy chairman Selwyn MacFarlane told Reuters that the firm might consider reshuffling its non-beer investments if units did not manage to compete on international terms.</p>
<p>"In any portfolio, especially one as big as ours, there are always ones (investments) that come in and go out," he said.</p>
<p>The group's competitive markets saw margins fall across the group, but the firm said it benefited from tight cost control and a fall in its effective tax rate.</p>
<p>Outside South Africa SAB has extensive beer interests and recently launched a $413 million international share issue to raise funds for its overseas expansion.</p>
<p>It is expanding export operations into places like Russia and Latin America, which is now its biggest export market outside Africa.</p>
<p>SAB is also the largest brewer in Poland, Hungary and Romania and is seeking out further buying opportunities in other privatising economies in the region, such as Bulgaria.</p>
<p>"We constantly look at these places," MacFarlane said, but added that no specific talks had begun.</p>
<p>The group is also looking to spread into more African countries outside its current interests of Zambia, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Mozambique.</p>
<p>The focus of the hunt is on East Africa, as the West African market is seen as already well served by French-dominated brewing concerns. "We are exploring other countries on the east coast (of Africa)," MacFarlane said.</p>
