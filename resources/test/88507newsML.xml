<p>A 12-year-old Missouri boy may have killed his mother and himself in a dispute over Internet-related telephone bills, police said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The bodies of Ann Hoffman, 42, and her son Brad were found in their California, Missouri, home last week. She had been shot six times and the boy died of one shot to his head. A gun was found near his body.</p>
<p>The Moniteau County Sheriff's Office near where the family lived in central Missouri said the boy's telephone bills from an online provider service ran into hundreds of dollars a month. It said the boy's father, who was divorced from Hoffman, had met with his son and ex-wife last week to discuss the bills.</p>
<p>Sheriff Kenny Jones also said he was investigating a report that the boy had chatted over the Internet with a girl in Mexico last month telling her that he was contemplating suicide.</p>
