<p>Phar-Mor Inc said it plans to open two new stores and remodel 13 stores during the next year.</p>
<p>It said it will incorporate its "Warehouse District" format in these remodels and new stores wherever possible. The Warehouse District format expands Phar-Mor stores' existing grocery offering and adds frozen and refrigerated food.</p>
<p>Earlier, the company reported a fourth quarter profit, after reporting a loss for the comparable quarter a year ago. However, Phar-Mor reported a loss for its fiscal 1997 year, due to expenses associated with its proposed business combination with ShopKo Stores.</p>
<p>The company said it opened its 104th store in Moorestown, N.J. in July.</p>
