<p>Speculators will undoubtedly be taking a close look at the Hong Kong dollar this week after their successful assaults on other Asian currencies, but this time they will hit a brick wall, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong currency, linked to the U.S. dollar since 1983 after a speculative attack, is basically the last pegged currency in the region and an obvious target, the analysts said.</p>
<p>But short of the authorities deciding that now is the time to do away with it, it will stay pegged, they added.</p>
<p>"Those running the Hong Kong dollar don't really understand how different the system is from the fixed exchange rate systems that Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia had," said Chi Lo, regional economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in Singapore.</p>
<p>Other fixed exchange rate systems, have suffered because the central bank, while trying to manage the exchange rate, finds that policy conflicts with its monetary stance.</p>
<p>If interest rates have to be kept high to bolster the currency at a time when a sagging economy is crying out for easier policy, pressure starts to build and something has to give. And that, more often that not, is the currency.</p>
<p>It is not just a Southeast Asian phenomena, exactly this happened to sterling in 1992, when soaring unemployment and falling output were sharply at odds with the high level of interest rates needed to maintain sterling in Europe's exchange rate mechanism (ERM).</p>
<p>The result was sterling crashing out of the system and effectively devaluing by 15 percent.</p>
<p>So Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines need not feel hard done by, they have simply gone the way of others before them.</p>
<p>But the Hong Kong system is different because of the currency board system which is an extremely rigid system requiring, by law, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) to hold the peg and take no account of the economy when they defend the dollar.</p>
<p>"The Hong Kong dollar is not just a peg: it's a link, in the sense that every Hong Kong dollar they issue is backed by an equivalent amount of U.S. dollars according to the peg," said Chai Woon Khien, Head of Asian Research at Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken in Singapore.</p>
<p>"In the case of a peg, the printing mechanism is not controlled by the exchange rate peg so it's less firm and committed than a currency link."</p>
<p>Under the peg the Exchange Fund buys or sells U.S. dollars at a fixed parity of HK$7.80.</p>
<p>As note-issuing banks buy or sell Hong Kong dollars to the public they are bound to undertake a reverse transaction by selling or buying Hong Kong dollars from the Exchange Fund.</p>
<p>This drains, or injects, liquidity in to the monetary system so pressures for a strong Hong Kong dollar will lower interest rates and vice-versa.</p>
<p>On top of all this the HKMA has enormous reserves at its disposal - close to $200 billion including those of China -- and its economic backdrop is solid.</p>
<p>While the merchandise trade deficit is growing, the services trade surplus is enough to cover the gap and while there are no official figures, the capital account has seen net inflows, analysts said.</p>
<p>So abandoning the peg would take a change in the law and analysts see that as highly unlikely because it would severely damage the credibility of the "one country-two systems" policy that preserves Hong Kong's capitalist freedoms.</p>
<p>"More importantly, keeping the peg is a political, not economic, decision," said Joe Zhang, economist at Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"Both Beijing and the Hong Kong government want to keep it for the foreseeable future. In recent years, both have gone out of their way to justify the importance of maintaining the peg."</p>
<p>"I firmly believe that the Hong Kong dollar will survive the current turmoil unscathed."</p>
