<p>Stock analysts saw little respite ahead for the fragile Thai stock market after it plummetted on Monday to its lowest level in over three years as foreign investors dumped mainly banking shares.</p>
<p>Investors sold banks heavily as they were spooked by the possible financial impact on banks of new government rules limiting foreign loans, analysts told Reuters.</p>
<p>Sentiment was also dampened on a belief that banks' profits growth this year might be stunted by dimming prospects for lower interest rates, they added.</p>
<p>The stock index tumbled 6.0 percent, or 60.26 points, to 944.63 points at the close, the lowest level since August 3, 1993, when the market ended at 938.24 points.</p>
<p>"Today's fall was one of the heaviest in the Thai bourse's history, when foreign firms joined hands and sold stocks," said Thanadech Mahapokai of Book Club Finance and Securities.</p>
<p>The Thai market, which has been falling steadily since last Tuesday, bucked the trend of most other Asian markets on Monday, which were robust after U.S. stocks rallied on Friday.</p>
<p>"We will see a bit more pressure on the market this week. But some stocks are relatively reasonably priced and we might see some bargain-hunting set in," said James Marshall, head of research at Capital Nomura Securities.</p>
<p>"What we are seeing is a realignment of recent overweighting in Thai bank stocks by foreign investors and the money going into other stock markets in the region," he added.</p>
<p>Last Friday, the central bank announced it planned to curb foreign fund inflows, including limits on short-term loans offshore banking units can bring into Thailand.</p>
<p>"Investors were worried that this news will affect the profitability of banks and they sold," said an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>"Jardine Fleming and Credit Lyonnais were the biggest foreign sellers in the market this morning. But I think what happened today was a bit of an overreaction...it was overdone," said an analyst at SCB Securities.</p>
<p>Several research houses have predicted that Thai banks' profits growth this year would be much lower than last year's growth of 15.6 percent.</p>
<p>Large banks such as Bangkok Bank, Thai Farmers Bank BK, Siam City Bank and Krung Thai Bank and a host of finance companies, including Finance One were among the key losers.</p>
<p>Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest, lost 17 baht to 187 while Thai Farmers was down 16 at 146.</p>
<p>Bangkok Bank Plc said last Friday it planned to raise its rates for fixed deposits, and speculation that others might follow dampened sentiment, they added.</p>
<p>Expectations earlier were for cuts of up to 50 basis points by the end of this year, but with pressure up on bank profits, an easing trend was seen unlikely, analysts said.</p>
<p>Foreigners were also worried about the slowing Thai economy, brokers said.</p>
<p>Thailand is ruled by a caretaker government led by Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa until elections are held on November 17 and a new government is formed.</p>
<p>Investors fear the authorities might not take serious measures in the interim to combat the economic sluggishness. They were also concerned about the quality of the government that would emerge after the polls, brokers said.</p>
