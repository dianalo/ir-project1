<p>South Korean base metals demand remains depressed on a combination of financial woes at companies such as Kia and the Jinro group, low seasonal summer demand and high world prices, dealers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"There has been no spot aluminium business since three-month prices broke the $1,600 a tonne level and this has combined with the financial troubles of several big domestic groups," a dealer at a major trading house said.  </p>
<p>He said domestic buyers were asking for aluminium at lower than current market prices and they were locked in a stand-off with sellers.</p>
<p>Local dealers widely expect international aluminium prices to rise further next week.</p>
<p>Aluminium import premiums for spot delivery fell to between $90-$95 a tonne CIF Pusan over LME cash prices from $95-$100 a week ago, traders said.</p>
<p>Domestic aluminium prices rose to 1,560,000 won a tonne from 1,540,000 won a week earlier in line with recent gains on the LME, they said.  </p>
<p>Copper and zinc prices were unchanged at 2,553,000 won and 1,386,000 won a tonne respectively from the previous week.</p>
<p>"We don't know the current import premiums for copper spot delivery since there have been no purchases for spot delivery from overseas but only exports," one copper trader said.</p>
<p>Domestic lead prices were also flat at 678,000 won a tonne over the past week.</p>
<p>Several Korean traders said some Chinese zinc smelters are facing delivery problems due to the low quality of their zinc products.  </p>
<p>"We heard that the quality problems would cost the Chinese, an additional $100 a tonne to meet London Metal Exchange (LME) standards," a trader with a brokerage firm said.</p>
<p>The trader said the quality problems had forced the Chinese smelters to borrow their existing loss-bearing short positions for the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p>He said the Chinese seem to have also rolled over their nearby positions to earn more time to prepare physical delivery against their shorts.</p>
