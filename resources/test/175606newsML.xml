<p>Fund managers are starting to grow restive over Brazil, saying ugly looking trade numbers and the persistently shaky state of its government finances are translating into heightened risk.</p>
<p>That impression has taken shape over the past two weeks after the country launched a $750 million global bond, only to see its spread widen by about 30 basis points over US Treasuries -- indicating a shift for the worse in investor perception of Brazilian risk.</p>
<p>While the spread has edged back in over recent days, investors are taking note of the increased downside, particulaly in the light of a trade deficit growing alarmingly fast against only moderate economic growth.</p>
<p>"The change in perception has been a result of the trade and fiscal deficits showing a worse than expected performance recently," Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets said.</p>
<p>"(The widening in the spread of) the sovereign bond issue... demonstrates an increase in the risk associated with Brazil."</p>
<p>Brazil posted a surprisingly $655 million trade deficit in September and economists say it could widen another $1.0 billion in October, taking the year end level to $4.0 billion after the government originally forecast equilibrium.</p>
<p>Debt market investors in particular are sceptical.</p>
<p>"Downward momentum, a poor Eurobond issue and lack of fundamental news (is weighing) on the assets," ING Barings said in a weekly report released at the start of November. "We expect that Brazil will continue to underperform."</p>
<p>But other fund managers dismiss these fears, pointing to Brazil's outstanding performance both on the debt and stock markets for almost all this year.</p>
<p>Brazil is up nearly 25 percent over the year to date on the IFC's index of emerging market equities, compared with 13 percent for Mexico and 8.1 percent for Argentina. And it is up over 30 percent on JP Morgan's composite bond index compared to 19 percent for Argentina and 19.5 percent for Mexico.</p>
<p>While the trade and fiscal deficits are indeed a worry, fund managers say help is already materialising on the trade front as the currency starts to ease.</p>
<p>"Those fears are right," said Keith Swabe, fixed income manager of West Merchant Bank's Plus 500 High Yield Fund. "But I'm more sanguine, purely on the back of my faith in the ability of the economic team to micro manage."</p>
<p>He took heart from recent foreign exchange news showing a softening real -- it ended 0.9 percent lower, at 1.0285 to the dollar, on the commercial exchange market on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said restructured Brazilian debt, or Brady bonds, were now trading at historically tight levels -- through Argentine debt and tight to Mexico -- but added that could be difficult to maintain looking ahead.</p>
<p>"If Brazil continues with the reform proces then there is room for further growth. If it stumbles or is just not progressing at the speed the market requires, then that spread contraction will be difficut to maintain," he said.</p>
<p>The central bank released data at the end of October putting Brazil's net public sector debt at 35 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>But Philip Ehrmann, head of global emerging markets at Gartmore Investment Management, dismissed the critical perceptions as a negative short-term view.</p>
<p>Gartmore is overweight on Brazilian equities in a Latin American portfolio and remains bullish looking ahead.</p>
<p>"We are looking forward to earnings growth of 15 to 20 percent next year," he said, adding he agreed with Brazil's call for a review of its rating by the major credit rating agencies after they awarded Russia levels two notches above Brazil.</p>
<p>"It's not exactly a heavily indebted country," he said. "I think the risks in Brazil are considerably less than they are in Russia."</p>
