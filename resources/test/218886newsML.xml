<p>Indonesian Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said on Tuesday the widening of the central bank's dollar-rupiah trading band was positive for foreign debt payments.</p>
<p>"The strengthening of the rupiah does not put a burden on our principal and interest debt payments. The effect was instead positive because we only need less rupiah to repay debts," Mar'ie told parliament.</p>
<p>Indonesia widened its dollar-rupiah trading band, or so-called intervention band, to eight percent in September from five percent. This band allows the central bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market if the rate falls outside its limits.</p>
<p>The band widening had caused the rupiah to strengthen sharply against the dollar in the past.</p>
<p>The World Bank has previously said Indonesia's foreign debt stands at about $100 billion.</p>
