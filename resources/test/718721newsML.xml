<p>The leader of Canada's official opposition on Thursday accused Prime Minister Jean Chretien of hurting Canada's relations with the United States through disparaging comments he made at the NATO summit in Madrid.</p>
<p>"Mr. Chretien has managed to insult the American political process, the president, the congress, state and municipal leaders and the U.S. public service," Reform Party leader Preston Manning said in a statement.</p>
<p>In unguarded remarks to Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene on Wednesday, Chretien was overheard criticizing (U.S.) President (Bill) Clinton for approving only three new NATO members and not five, as Canada and others had hoped.</p>
<p>"It's not for reasons of security," Chretien was reported to have said. "It's all done for short-term political reasons to win elections."</p>
<p>Chretien's comments, made in French, were picked up by a live microphone left on inadvertantly near the two prime ministers, who were unaware their conversation was being recorded.</p>
<p>Commenting on the U.S. political system, Chretien told Dehaene: "In your country or my country, all the politicians would be in prison because they (Americans) sell their votes.</p>
<p>"(They say): 'If you want me to vote for NATO, then you have to build a bridge for me in my electoral district...'" Chretien added to the chuckling Belgian premier.</p>
<p>Chretien's comments were widely reported in Canadian newspapers and in broadcast media on Thursday.</p>
<p>He was said to have boasted about standing up to the Americans over the issue of trade with Cuba and to have spoken critically about patronage in the U.S. voting system.</p>
<p>Manning said Chretien's remarks were damaging to Canada's relations with the United States. The two countries are close allies and form the world's biggest trading partnership.</p>
<p>"What's worse, he now appears to be unwilling to repair the damage he may have caused," Manning added.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Canada's Foreign Ministry said there had been no international repercussions from Chretien's comments.</p>
