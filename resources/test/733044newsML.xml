<p>India will set up an independent agency to coordinate exploration for coal and lignite, Coal Minister Kanti Singh said.</p>
<p>The agency would also have responsibility for allocating the new exploration blocks through competitive bidding, a Coal Ministry statement quoted Singh as telling a meeting of parliamentary deputies on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The creation of an independent agency follows the recommendation of a committee on integrated coal policy, the statement said.</p>
<p>India in February opened up the domestic coal industry allowing private companies to bid for coal and lignite blocks with or without foreign participation.</p>
<p>Singh said that a regulatory body would also be set up to resolve price disputes between coal producers and consumers.</p>
<p>Outstanding debt owed by consumers to coal companies stood at 39.42 billion rupees out of which power firms owe 32.55 billion rupees, she said.</p>
<p>Coal output during the first quarter of 1997-98 (April-March) rose to 57.78 million tonnes, up 7.0 per cent from 54.01 million in the corresponding period in the previous year.</p>
