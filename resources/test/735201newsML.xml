<p>The small car sector is set to show a boom in production over the next five years, with world-wide output seen surging by 36 percent between 1996 and 2002, according to the latest Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) survey.</p>
<p>Vehicles like the Rover Mini and Ford Motor Co's Ka are set to fuel explosive growth in capacity in the so-called A and sub-B segments.</p>
<p>The forecast of a 36 percent hike in smaller car production compares with overall passenger car output growing by just over 12 percent between 1996 and 2002, fuelled by emerging and developing market demand.</p>
<p>The sports utility vehicle (SUV) market growth is seen second only to the small car segment, with SUVs forecast to notch up 19 percent growth by 2002.</p>
<p>Multi-purpose vehicles (MPV) are expected to push ahead in developed markets but this "will be offset by low penetration in fast-growing developing markets" said the EIU's "World Production Forecasts" survey.</p>
<p>Segment B cars, vehicles which include the Vauxhall Astra and Ford Escort models, are seen growing production by 13.9 percent over the period. "Although this segment will benefit from a shift towards smaller cars, particularly in Europe and Japan, its potential will be reduced by the expansion of the sub-B segments," said the EIU.</p>
<p>The Escort-sized C segment of vehicles and the MPVs are seen delivering growth of 12 percent each, with the C category continuing to dominate world sales.</p>
<p>The next vehicle-size up, the D segment, is seen achieving below-average growth of six percent and the luxury and executive car segments E and F will be even lower, seeing production grow by just five percent through to 2002.</p>
