<p>Talbots Inc Thursday reported sales for the five and 35 week periods ended October 5 saying it experienced weaker than expected customer traffic during the latest month.</p>

<p>"As expected, our sales performance in September was impacted by the shift in our midseason sale one week later versus the comparable period last year, similar to that of our semiannual sale held this past June, Talbots said. "In addition to the timing shift, we also experienced weaker than expected customer traffic in our stores during the month."</p>
<p>It said "We are now increasing our efforts to drive store traffic and continuing to develop effective and focused marketing programs that broaden our brand awareness and communicate the changes in our merchandise assortments."</p>
<p>The company also said "we are pleased with our (catalog business) performance to date and believe the strong results of all of our fall catalogs since July gives us an indication that our merchandise changes are being accepted by customers."</p>
