<p>The Malaysian government said on Wednesday that independent power producers must be involved in providing electricity to rural areas, but has not decided on how this will be done.</p>
<p>Energy, Telecommunications and Posts Minister Leo Moggie said that the power producers may have to offer reduction on the sale price of power they were selling to state-controlled utility Tenaga Nasional Bhd. Another possibility is for the power firms to contribute to an energy fund which will be used to provide electricity to the rural areas.  </p>
<p>Moggie told reporters after a Tenaga function that the government would not cancel power purchase agreement contracts with these companies in order to get them to be involved in rural electrification projects.</p>
<p>"We would like to see everbody being involved in rural and social obligation," Moggie said.</p>
<p>He added that at the moment rural electricity projects are completely handled by Tenaga.</p>
<p>"It is imposing quite a bit of strain on Tenaga, particularly on its financial position," he said.</p>
<p>Moggie said the government is trying to fix a date to meet the five independent power producers in the country to discuss their involvement. He stressed that the government has no intention of changing its power purchase contracts with these companies.</p>
<p>Moggie said Tenaga is likely to continue the physical work of building up electricity facilities in the rural areas.</p>
<p>"The physical work may still be done by Tenaga. It may be a bit cumbersome if every company is to physically come in," he said.</p>
