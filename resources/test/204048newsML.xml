<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, accusing Israel of violating its 1994 economic agreement with the PLO, demanded on Wednesday that it be rewritten.</p>
<p>Arafat told a Paris World Bank donors' meeting on the West Bank and Gaza that the autonomous Palestinian areas were losing $7 million a day because of Israel's decision to close them off last February after bomb attacks by Moslem fundamentalists.</p>
<p>"The peace process is at a crossroads and I fear that it may even go into reverse, to the benefit of tensions and instability," he said in a speech released by his staff.</p>
<p>"The unjust siege threatens the peace process and raises a shadow over the hopes and ambitions of the Palestinian people," he added.</p>
<p>Output was down this year by 20 percent compared to the past two years, the agriculture sector was "disastrously" hit, unemployment had jumped to a "dangerous" rate of 63 percent and investment projects were down.</p>
<p>The economic agreement signed with Israel in Paris, Arafat said, was based on two principles -- a Palestinian workforce in Israel that was 90,000 strong in 1993, and freedom of movement for individuals and goods to and from Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p>"For the last 30 months, Israel has violated this accord through deliberate methods, procedural devices and decisions that strip the accord of its meaning, form and content.</p>
<p>"That is why we demand that the accord be rewritten in line with our joint commitments which provide for the right to revise the accord since May 4, 1995, something which Israel has always evaded," Arafat said.</p>
<p>Israel denied the charges, saying it would demand its own changes in response to his request to rewrite the agreement.</p>
<p>"Israel did not violate the agreement but if the Palestinians want to change the agreement Israel will ask to introduce changes and it's not certain the Palestinians will want these proposed changes," a government official said.</p>
<p>Arafat urged a revised accord which must force Israel to lift restrictions and quotas on direct imports by the Palestinians, transfer sales tax revenue collected by the Israeli treasury and recognise Palestinian technical standards.</p>
<p>In a drive to boost aid for the West Bank and Gaza, Arafat outlined an $845 million investment programme for 1997 which he said aimed to consolidate essential infrastructure, encourage investment in the social sector, create jobs and strengthen the private sector.</p>
<p>The Bank's Consultative Group has so far pledged some $2.9 billion in assistance to the areas for 1994-98, but Palestinian leaders are keen to ensure that pledges are fulfilled.</p>
<p>"We hope there will be a financial commitment this afternoon," Arafat told reporters after meeting French Prime Minister Alain Juppe.</p>
<p>Arafat, who will hold a news conference at 1630 GMT, said there was no progress in talks on the Israeli redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron. "The Israelis want to change the accord, I don't want to change the accord," he said.</p>
<p>The World Bank says the political situation has resulted in projections of a five percent decline of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 1996 in the autonomous Palestinian areas.</p>
<p>A main hope for improvement is the expected opening in about two months of the al-Muntar industrial park on the Palestinian side of the Israel-Gaza Strip border, World Bank officials said.</p>
<p>At best, the project will employ 17,000 people directly, mostly in textiles, and 35,000 indirectly by early 1998.</p>
<p>Kemal Dervis, World Bank vice-president for the Middle East and North Africa, said barring new political upheavals "there is no reason that the Palestinian economy cannot do well".</p>
<p>"The bad situation is due to political and security constraints as well as uncertainty in the minds of potential investors. But this is not a situation that is so bad it cannot work. Things can and do advance," he said.</p>
