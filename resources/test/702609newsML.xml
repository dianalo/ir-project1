<p>EqualNet Holding Corp said Wednesday it had entered into a letter of intent to merge with Cherry Communications Inc, a privately-held, switch-based long distance provider.</p>
<p>Under the terms of an eventual agreement, Cherry shareholders would own about 91 percent of the combined company, while EqualNet holders would have the remaining nine percent.</p>
<p>EqualNet, a telecommunications company offering discounted long-distance services, said it still had to negotiate a definitive agreement with Cherry.</p>
<p>It said it expected to complete a deal in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>The new company would be called Cherry Holding Corp, it added.</p>
<p>EqualNet serves small business customers, while Cherry serves wholesale and commercial customers.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq halted trading in EqualNet's stock in light of the news with the last sale at 2-1/4.</p>
