<p>British house prices rose by a seasonally adjusted 1.0 percent in May, following a revised 0.4 percent rise in April, Halifax Plc said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Halifax house price index is now 6.6 percent higher than in May last year, while the index has risen to 221.0 from 218.9 in April.</p>
<p>Halifax, which floated on the stock exchange on Monday, when it converted into a bank, said the latest figures showed the housing market is continuing to recover at a moderate pace, with prices now just under three percent below their 1989 peak.</p>
<p>Britain's newest bank and still the country's largest mortgage lender said house price inflation is forecast at seven percent in the fourth quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Last week, the Nationwide Building Society, which in contrast is determined to hang on to its mutual status, said house prices rose a seasonally adjusted 1.2 percent last month.</p>
<p>It said prices were 10 percent higher on an annual basis.</p>
<p>The Halifax said prices paid by first-time buyers rose by 1.7 percent in May, up from 1.0 percent last month. The average price paid was 50,371 stg, reflecting an annual rate of inflation in this sector of 7.3 percent.</p>
<p>Prices of new houses dropped 1.5 percent last month, the Halifax said, and are now close to the level at the end of last year and down a little year-on-year.</p>
<p>On Friday, Nationwide's head of research Paul Sanderson said the housing market was not racing away and remained quite subdued in patches, particularly in the north of the country.</p>
<p>As a result, he urged Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown not to cut or abolish tax relief on home loan payments in his July 2 budget -- a move many economists expect.</p>
<p>"The timing of such a move might be questionable...given the limited strength of the recovery, prospects of a further increase in interest rates and the disproportionate regional impact of reductions in tax relief, he said.</p>
<p>Britain's new Monetary Policy Committee, granted power to set interest rates by Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown, meets for the first time on Thursday and Friday.</p>
