<p>Wimbledon striker Dean Holdsworth will miss his team's next two matches after being given compassionate leave by manager Joe Kinnear who has told him to "sort your life out".</p>
<p>Holdsworth, 28,  married with two young sons, is at the centre of kiss-and-tell scandal with a busty, teenage soft-porn model. Another teenager has also said she was involved with the player.</p>
<p>And it emerged on Wednesday that Holdsworth was warned about drunkenness by police after being arrested at his home last Sunday.</p>
<p>Holdsworth was arrested for being "drunk and incapable" and for breach of the peace but was released after being given the warning, a police spokesman said.</p>
<p>Holdsworth's wife, Samantha, 28, was awarded a non-molestation order against him at the High Court on Tuesday following the incident, which happened at the family home.</p>
<p>The row came after lurid tabloid allegations that the 5.0 million pounds ($8.5 million) rated player had been having an affair with porn model Linsey Dawn McKenzie and that they had had sex in his wife's car.</p>
<p>A second teenager later said that she had also been romanced by the footballer.</p>
<p>Kinnear said on Wednesday: "Dean's family is more important than football. When I spoke to him it was clear his mind was in turmoil. I have told him to take the time he needs."</p>
<p>Holdsworth has been pulled from the squad for Wednesday night's League Cup quarter-final at Bolton and will also miss Saturday's home league match against Derby.</p>
<p>Holdsworth has been in and out of the Wimbledon side this season and has not started a match since September, although he has been used regularly as a substitute.</p>
<p>Kinnear added: "He asked me if he could have time off to sort out his family life so I've given him a week off. I could have been hard and told him he had to come with us (to Bolton) but I'm showing the boy some compassion.</p>
<p>"He's had a bit of a trauma at the moment and he is very upset. His head is not on football at this time, he's mentally not tuned in. "</p>
