<p>* Market seen remaining liquid</p>

<p>Philippine inter-bank call loan rates were flat at an average of 10.53125 percent on Tuesday despite huge tax payments made by banks, traders said.</p>
<p>A foreign bank dealer estimated some 11 billion pesos were turned over to the government yesterday.</p>
<p>"There's so much liquidity," he said, due to maturing reverse repos. Banks have been reluctant to invest back in these bills because of the new 20 percent tax.  </p>
<p>Volume in the inter-bank market narrowed to 4.930 billion from 8.7 billion pesos. Of 33 participating financial institutions, 19 were lenders.</p>
<p>Some 5.0 billion pesos were expected to be drained from banks this week due to the sale of ten-year bonds today, traders said.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the market will remain liquid, traders said. "My guess is flat," one said, referring to the rates.</p>
<p>In the secondary market for T-bills, there was little activity since interest rates are expected to remain at current levels, a trader said.  </p>
<p>"There is no indication interest rates would go up," the trader said, citing the liquid market.</p>
<p>Market attention was also focused on the auction of ten-year bonds later today where the coupon rate is expected at 14.5 to 14.75 percent versus 16.0 in the previous auction in September.</p>
<p>Dealers said banks were just buying short-term bills to meet clients' requirements.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of eight instituions showed bid rates for three months ranged from 10.60 to 10.70; six months, 10.90 to 11.20; and one year, 11.40 to 11.60.</p>
