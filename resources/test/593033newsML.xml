<p>The United States on Saturday welcomed what it called a relatively smooth transfer of power in Zaire and called on the new leadership to establish an inclusive transitional government leading to elections.</p>
<p>"The United States welcomes reports that the transfer of power in Kinshasa is occurring with only minimal disorder and unrest," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said in a statement.</p>
<p>"This is an historic opportunity to shape the future of the country. We call on the new leadership to establish an inclusive transitional government leading to elections, and to ensure full respect for human rights throughout the country," he said.</p>
<p>Rebel leader Laurent Kabila proclaimed himself in charge of the country on Saturday as his forces entered the capital Kinshasa and departed President Mobutu Sese Seko's rag-tag army switched sides or fled.</p>
<p>Kabila, who has opposed Mobutu for more than 30 years, said he would set up a transitional government of public salvation within 72 hours and told Mobutu's army to lay down its arms. He also pledged a constituent assembly within 60 days to work out a new transitional constitution.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration has been saying for weeks that the Mobutu era is over, making clear it has withdrawn support for the autocratic leader.</p>
<p>The State Department on Saturday also said it had no immediate plans to evacuate the 25 personnel at the U.S. embassy and 310 private Americans still in the country.</p>
<p>"We're not expecting to do that as of now," said spokeswoman Sharon Bowman.</p>
