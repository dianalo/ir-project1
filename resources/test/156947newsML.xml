<p>Midwest direct cash hogs were expected to trade mostly steady to lower Friday as some meat packing plants have cancelled plans to slaughter hogs Saturday, cash livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>In addition to cancelling Saturday's slaughter, some packer buyers in Iowa and Minnesota said enough hogs were bought Thursday to satisfy Friday's slaughter needs and part of Monday's.</p>
<p>Illinois dealers expect steady hog prices Friday because of light marketings there this week. Farmers are concentrating on the corn harvest rather than selling of hogs, they said.  </p>
<p>However, Ohio sources said light hog marketings there this week should prompt at least $0.50 higher bids Friday.</p>
<p>USDA reported Thursday's hog slaughter at 368,000 head versus 371,000 a week ago and 364,000 a year ago.</p>
