<p>Russia's U.N. envoy said on Friday that Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali should be able to establish quite soon whether conditions in northern Iraq were safe enough to begin implementing a delayed "oil-for-food" plan.</p>
<p>But Boutros-Ghali, in an interview with Reuters, was more cautious, saying that the situation in northern Iraq was still not clear and that technical problems remained.</p>
<p>Asked repeatedly when he thought the programme might be implemented, the secretary-general said he did not know if it would be next month or before the end of the year.</p>
<p>"We still have not a clear assessment of the situation," he said. "We still have difficulties to implement this."</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali put the plan on hold after Iraqi troops recently entered the Kurdish-inhabited northern region of Iraq, delaying deployment through the country of U.N. personnel required to carry out the programme.</p>
<p>But Russia's ambassador Sergei Lavrov, in a separate briefing for journalists, said: "I believe that the secretary-general is well in a position to establish quite soon whether safe conditions exist in northern Iraq."</p>
<p>He said Security Council members, at a monthly lunch with Boutros-Ghali, had discussed the "oil-for-food" plan under which Iraq would be allowed to buy $2 billion of oil over six months to buy food, medicine and other necessities to offset the effects of U.N. trade sanctions in force since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Lavrov said there were still reports of "isolated fighting in villages" in northern Iraq, but "the personnel which is required and the deployment of which has been delayed, we were assured could be there in a matter of a few days."</p>
<p>"The implementation process is under way, as the secretary-general assured us," he said, adding that some technical procedures still had to be completed.</p>
<p>Boutros-Ghali said he had received a long letter from Iraq's Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf saying he wanted "to send a delegation to discuss how we can accelerate the process." He gave no date but said he was open to discussions with any group Iraq might send.</p>
<p>The U.N. chief pointed to the departure of foreign relief workers from the Kurdish north since the crisis, as well as so-called technical hold-ups in approving an escrow account for the the proceeds of oil sales and an oil-pricing formula.</p>
<p>"It is the continuation of what we have seen," he said in reference to delays that have plagued the talks since an agreement between Iraq and the United Nations was signed on May 20 following four months of negotiations.</p>
<p>Most diplomats believe there is little chance the plan would be implemented before the November 5 U.S. elections, with U.S. officials saying pointedly that conditions in Iraq made it difficult to proceed with the programme at this time.</p>
<p>A final decision is up to Boutros-Ghali, not the Security Council. But the United States can delay procedures and contracts through the council's sanctions committee and has done so on nearly every technical issue to date.</p>
<p>Last week the United States said it needed more time to study a formula for setting the price of oil, which had been worked out between Iraq and outside oil experts and approved by the other 14 members of the sanctions committee.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department also has not yet given its approval for an escrow account to receive the oil revenues set up at the New York branch of the French-based Banque Nationale de Paris. The United States has to grant an exemption for Iraqi funds because of the trade sanctions imposed on Baghdad in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.</p>
