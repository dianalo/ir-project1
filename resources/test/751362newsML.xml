<p>China's Shenzhen Development Bank Ltd's board of directors have formally appointed Zhou Lin as the bank's new president, the company said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The announcement comes one month after securities regulators dismissed He Yun, former president of the bank, over the bank's illegal trading of its own shares.</p>
<p>Authorities also confiscated illicit profits of 90.34 million yuan from the trading, and barred He from the financial sector for five years.</p>
<p>Zhou was previously the president of the Shenzhen branch of the Guangdong Development Bank said the company statement, which was published in the Shenzhen-based Securities Times.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, shareholders of the Shenzhen-listed domestic currency A share company approved a five-for-10 bonus issue plus a pre-tax cash payout of 0.2 yuan per share as a dividend for 1996.</p>
<p>Investors had feared the bank would change the dividend plan, which was drafted before the stock scandal, due to the cash seizure.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Development Bank is considered the leader of Shenzhen's A share market in light of its large capitalisation and strong earnings record.</p>
<p>Trading in the bank's A shares was suspended on Tuesday and Wednesday morning and would resume on Wednesday afternoon, the Shenzhen Stock Exchange has said.</p>
<p>The bank's move to leave the dividend plan intact helped boost the Shenzhen A share market in early trading on Wednesday morning, brokers said.</p>
