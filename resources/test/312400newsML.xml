<p>German analysts on Thursday said they regretted the resignation of Mercedes chairman Helmut Werner from the Daimler-Benz group but said the move paved the way for a key revamp of the industrial group.</p>
<p>In a long-expected move, Werner on Thursday handed in his resignation to Daimler's presidium, explaining that he believed the restructured group had no place for his expertise.</p>
<p>Under the restructuring plan for the parent group, Mercedes' management will be integrated into Daimler. Analysts believe this will bring huge benefits in cost-savings, allowing the parent group to streamline its middle management structure.</p>
<p>Peter Schmidt at Automotive Industry Data, U.K., said that although Werner had no doubt made a very significant contribution to turning Mercedes around, his contribution to the modern-day company was no longer quite so essential.</p>
<p>"This is a good move for Daimler and a good move for Mercedes shareholders. It is not surprising, you don't need me to tell you that there has been a power struggle between Werner and Schrempp," Schmidt said, referring to the Daimler-Benz chairman Juergen Schremmp, who took office in May 1995.</p>
<p>"There wasn't room for Werner and Schrempp in the one company. Schrempp had to get clear and undisputed control," he added.</p>
<p>"Werner is a very capable guy but he ran Mercedes as though it was his own company and an autonomous group and this just is not the case. In this day and age this is not the way any large multinational can go", Schmidt argued.</p>
<p>A London-based auto analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed that Mercedes and Daimler would not see any negative impact from Werner's departure.</p>
<p>"I think there will be very little change. The general direction has already been sketched out," the analyst said.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day I think first of all that it is unfortunate to lose Werner," he continued.</p>
<p>But he added that the action Schrempp had taken to reshape Daimler, with sell-offs of difficult operations, the new slimmed-down company was relatively straightforward for the chairman to oversee himself.</p>
<p>"The thing is that Schrempp had time on his hands. Once they got rid of Fokker and the other problem children, they basically have Airbus and Mercedes left," he said.</p>
<p>"There is not much active management and the key driver will be Mercedes. Schrempp wants power and more power."</p>
<p>But a third analyst was more sceptical about the move. The German auto industry analyst, also speaking on condition of anonymity said, "A good man has been driven out of the business."</p>
<p>She warned that Daimler's overall management could run into problems trying to manage the more specialised cars unit.</p>
<p>"The question is still whether Daimler should meddle with Mercedes," she said. But she added, "the decisions have already been taken and we will not see the impact of Werner's departure for some time."</p>
