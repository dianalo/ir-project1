<p>A U.S. company is testing a drug that potentially could help obese people lose weight by raising their metabolism, a researcher said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Dow, principal research investigator with pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc, said obesity could be treated either by limiting food intake or by increasing energy use.</p>
<p>That is usually done through exercise. But Pfizer has developed compounds that in animal trials boosted metabolic rates to mimic the "exercise effect" of increased calorie burning without exercise. The tests showed a 10 to 30 percent jump in metabolic rate.</p>
<p>A higher metabolic rate leads the body to slowly burn extra fat.</p>
<p>"If you have a 10 percent increase in energy expenditure, you're potentially looking at about a half pound (230 grams) a week drop in weight," Dow said in a statement from the American Chemical Society. Dow presented his findings on Wednesday at the society's meeting in San Francisco.</p>
<p>In animal trials of the new compound, Dow said researchers had seen no increase in food intake to match the higher metabolism.</p>
<p>"If I go out and ski all day and I come in, I'm ravenous and I eat more," Dow said. "But that sort of compensation has not been seen in the animal tests with these compounds."</p>
<p>The compounds are hormone mimics that act on the beta-adrenergic system, which has three types of receptors in cells in the body.</p>
<p>Some previous similar compounds passed through animal trials with flying colors but failed in human clinical trials, Dow said. Dow expects the new compounds to perform better in human trials than their predecessors did.</p>
<p>If human clinical trials are successful, the compounds could be available within five to 10 years, Dow said.</p>
<p>But in an interview with San Francisco's KCBS radio station, Dow stressed it would not be a miracle pill.</p>
<p>"Our ultimate clinical goal as we envision it now would be to increase energy expenditure around 10 percent and that would turn into approximately half a pound (230 grams) a week weight loss if it were successful...So you aren't going to be losing 50 pounds (23 kgs) over a short period of time," he said.</p>
