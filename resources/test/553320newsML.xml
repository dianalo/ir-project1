<p>Kenya's opposition leaders used the funeral of the father of dissident Koigi wa Wamwere on Thursday to trumpet a need for unity ahead of general elections this year.</p>
<p>Joseph Wamwere died three years ago but the family refused to bury him because Koigi was in prison at the time awaiting trial for robbery and raiding a police post. He was jailed for four years for robbery last year.</p>
<p>But Koigi is free on bail pending a high court appeal. The leading Kenyan dissident was also held between 1990 and 1992 accused of treason but the charges were withdrawn.</p>
<p>About 2,000 people packed Saint Peter's Roman Catholic cathedral in Lanet, 160 km (100 miles) northwest of Nairobi, for the funeral service before Joseph Wamwere was to be buried at his farm to the west.</p>
<p>The leader of Kenya's official opposition in parliament Michael Kijana Wamalwa was joined by opposition figures Mwai Kibaki, Paul Muite, Raila Odinga and presidential hopeful Charity Kaluki Ngilu for the funeral.</p>
<p>Wamalwa said of Koigi: "You could see that this man had a special courage and a special fortitude that only belongs to someone who believes in total freedom. I regard him as one of the greatest leaders of our times."</p>
<p>The human rights group Amnesty International has adopted Koigi as a prisoner of conscience and says evidence that led to his conviction on robbery charges was fabricated.</p>
<p>Koigi, a former parliament member for a constituency that included President Daniel arap Moi's rural Kabarak home in the Rift Valley, was jailed with his younger brother Charles and a friend. A fourth man was freed for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>Opposition legislator Njehu Gatabaki said Koigi had demonstrated rare courage and had suffered for Kenyans.</p>
<p>"We are here for the burial of your father; but we are also here to revive the freedom struggle and to plant a seed for the removal of President Daniel arap Moi," Gatabaki said.</p>
<p>There was no trouble at the funeral. Witnesses said police controlled traffic when Joseph Wamwere's body was brought for the church service. A few policemen followed the cortege.</p>
<p>Koigi told Reuters at the cathedral that he planned to stand for parliament if minimal constitutional changes were made. But he added he would campaign for a boycott if the changes were not made. He gave no details of the reforms he wanted.</p>
<p>Kenya's opposition has been deeply divided and Moi and his ruling party is widely expected to win the elections this year.</p>
