<p>North American paper producers, complaining they are at a competitive disadvantage compared with their European rivals, are pressing for action to speed up the elimination of tariffs on newsprint and other paper products.</p>
<p>The American Forest &amp; Paper Association (AF&amp;PA) and the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association are pushing for action to accelerate tariff cuts at the first ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation in Singapore on December 9-13.</p>
<p>"We want to see effort made to advance the demise of the paper tariffs that are in the Uruguay Round, to have them end on January 1, 1998," AF&amp;PA president Henson Moore told reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>This would be six years earlier than was agreed in the Uruguay Round trade pact in 1994.</p>
<p>The AF&amp;PA says that European tariffs on paper products are much higher than in the United States, Canada or Japan.</p>
<p>"It is an irritant...the idea is to create a level playing field in international trade," Moore said.</p>
<p>An EU official said Europe favoured further tariff cuts across the board but that any product must be taken in the context of a balanced package. He noted that the United States for example had high textiles tariffs.</p>
<p>The Singapore conference is expected to review the Uruguay Round and set the pace for new trade talks due to begin in 1999.</p>
<p>"Singapore probably won't have a tariff cutting package. It might allude to a tariff cutting package in the future," the EU official told Reuters.</p>
<p>Moore, participating in the general assembly meeting of the Confederation of European Paper Industries in Brussels, said the Canadian government had proposed faster elimination of tariffs.</p>
<p>"We have the belief that our government is going to support it very strongly," he said.</p>
<p>"This needs to be finished off. We see no value in those tariffs, no need for them except it gives an unfair competitive advantage," he added.</p>
<p>According to AF&amp;PA, some European tariffs are still at seven percent while most paper products enter the United States duty free. This has caused rising European paper exports to the United States.</p>
<p>In 1995, AF&amp;PA said, EU producers shipped 2.2 million tonnes worth $2.5 billion to the North American market.</p>
<p>In a statement it said tariff cuts would "directly benfit paper users, such as newspapers and magazine publishers, commercial printers and the packaging industry. Acclerating the cuts will provide these benefits sooner."</p>
