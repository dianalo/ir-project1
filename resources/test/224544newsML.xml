<p>U.S. tennis star Andre Agassi is likely drop out of the world's top 10 after deciding not to play next year's Australian Open grand slam event, Australian tennis officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>Agassi, who won the tournament in 1995, has decided he needs a break from tennis and will begin his 1997 campaign after the January 13-26 Australia Open, tournament director Paul McNamee said in a statement.</p>
<p>World number eight Agassi will however play in the International Tennis Federation's US$6.0 million Gand Slam Cup in Munich from December 2-8.</p>
<p>Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) spokesman Steve Casey told reporters he thought Agassi would probably drop out of the top 10 after missing the Australian Open but warned the 26-year-old from Las Vegas would bounce back quickly.</p>
<p>"When his confidence drops off so does his form, but I'm sure he'll be back," Casey said. "It's a pattern in his career that, whenever he has poor form, he comes back and is absolutely unbeatable."</p>
<p>Agassi, the gold medallist at this year's Atlanta Olympic Games, has won just two matches since losing to compatriot Michael Chang in the semifinals of the U.S. Open in August.</p>
<p>Last week he withdrew midway through the ATP's year-ending World Championship in Hanover with a stomach upset and cold.</p>
<p>He had earlier been fined US$50,000 for failing to attend two pre-event functions and was booed off the court after his straight sets loss to world number one Pete Sampras in the opening match of the tournament.</p>
<p>McNamee later told reporters he thought Agassi would have agonised over his decision not to come to Australia and play in the season's opening grand slam tournament.</p>
<p>"For Andre, the last thing he wanted (was) to miss a grand slam tournament but, if you look at his results, he has been struggling since the U.S. Open," McNamee said.</p>
<p>"There are certain times in a player's career where he has to bite the bullet. Obviously he wants to take a break to get his game back together," he said.</p>
<p>"I'm encouraged that Andre considers this to be one-off and intends to be back in 1998," he said.</p>
<p>Agassi has played in only two Australian Opens. After winning the tournament in his first appearance in 1995, Agassi was beaten by Chang in the semifinals this year.</p>
<p>Germany's Boris Becker and Monica Seles of the U.S. have both said they will return in 1997 to to defend their titles.</p>
