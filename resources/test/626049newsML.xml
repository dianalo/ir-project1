<p>Transco, the pipeline and transport arm of BG Plc, is to issue a tender to sell around 2.4 Terawatt hours (around 82 million therms) of gas in a phased disposal over this summer.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Transco said the tender would be issued in the next two to three weeks.</p>
<p>The company had originally announced in April that it was looking to sell up to 3 Terawatt hours (around 102 million therms) of balancing margins gas, or gas in storage during the winter as a reserve in case other mechanisms for balancing the pipeline system failed.</p>
<p>It then proposed a modification to the Network Code, the rules governing use of the pipeline system between Transco and gas shippers, to allow this to be done before September 30.</p>
<p>But Transco has now withdrawn this modification, number 142, and will instead sell the gas by tender in stages over the summer. A spokesman said the quantities and timings have not yet been set as the tender document is still being written, but he expects around 2.4 Terawatt hours to be offered in the next two to three weeks.</p>
