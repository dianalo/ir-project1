<p>German President Roman Herzog hit out at politicians at the weekend for failing to tackle desperately needed domestic reforms while competitor nations looked confidently to the future.</p>
<p>In a blunt speech in Berlin on Saturday night aimed squarely at both Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the opposition, Herzog said it was time to stop playing politics and foster a culture of flexibility and self-reliance. He also told his compatriots to stop moaning and take charge of their own lives.</p>
<p>Germany's president has no executive power, but with his prerogative as "conscience of the nation" can use well-timed words to shift the tone of a political debate.</p>
<p>Herzog's move was impeccably timed to capture popular frustration with political gridlock in Bonn at a time when unemployment is soaring and Germany's competitors are leaving it far behind.</p>
<p>"We are letting ourselves behave as if we had all the time in the world for change. Whether it's taxes, pensions, health, education or (European) monetary union, all you hear are the voices of the lobby groups and the doubters," he said.</p>
<p>"I warn all concerned against delaying or thwarting any of these reforms for tactical reasons. We cannot afford to have our political institutions blockading themselves."</p>
<p>It was no coincidence that Herzog spoke three days after the collapse of talks between Kohl and opposition Social Democrats (SPD), intended to get the SPD on board for a big tax reform which it can otherwise block with its Upper House majority.</p>
<p>Attempts to reform Germany's creaking social security and pensions systems to cut labour costs and boost job creation have also run into trouble, from both the opposition and the centre-right coalition, as politicians have already turned their attention to the general election late next year.</p>
<p>Ordinary Germans have been unimpressed. In a poll for Monday's edition of the weekly Der Spiegel, 56 percent of respondents said they were pessimistic about the future and 42 percent believed neither the SPD nor Kohl's Christian Democrats could solve the unemployment problem.</p>
<p>Herzog, formerly Germany's top judge, pointed to a "loss of economic dynamism, social paralysis and unbelievable mental depression" in Germany which he compared unfavourably to the optimism and dynamism of southeast Asian countries.</p>
<p>He urged the politicians to find a vision and promote confidence in the future which would stop Germans clinging desperately to the achievements of their post-World War Two economic miracle and obstructing change.</p>
<p>But he also told Germans themselves to become more flexible and self-reliant, be prepared to change careers several times, stop looking to the state to solve all their problems and have the courage to look to the future.</p>
<p>And he came close to intervening in day-to-day politics, making a list of concrete suggestions including dismantling subsidies, focusing health reform more closely on need and considering paying employers to take on the long-term jobless.</p>
<p>Discontent with Kohl's failure to advance reforms in his record 14 years in office resurfaced at the weekend with news of efforts by party rival and Saxony state premier Kurt Biedenkopf to question his decision to run for office again next year.</p>
<p>The mass-circulation weekly Bild am Sonntag said Biedenkopf had hit the nail on the head, but that in Germany's current state there was little prospect of change, and that opposition leader Oskar Lafontaine was little better.</p>
<p>"Both represent the incapacity to solve the large problems facing the country. Neither will bring voters flocking to the polls in 1998. Neither stands for what the president is urging. What a shame Herzog isn't standing for election."</p>
