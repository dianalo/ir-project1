<p>The European Union's monetary committee began a regularly scheduled meeting on Tuesday to resolve outstanding issues on a budget pact for countries joining a single currency.</p>
<p>However, given the contentious nature of the issues involved, there was little hope of a final accord on a budget stability pact ahead of a summit of EU leaders next month in Dublin.</p>
<p>EU monetary officials on Monday said the most likely outcome would be a progress report on the work completed so far, with negotiations continuing into next year.</p>
<p>Tough German demands have so far blocked an accord on a pact that penalises governments running excessive deficits within a monetary union. It is considered by many to be an essential element of economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>Perhaps the toughest hurdle is agreement on a precise definition of a severe economic downturn which would let governments with deficits above three percent of gross domestic product avoid sanctions.</p>
<p>Germany very much wants a quantitative definition of what constitutes so-called "temporary and exceptional" circumstances. But others say a narrow definition of an economic recession is unrealistic given obvious differences among EU economies.</p>
<p>As a possible compromise officials say the idea of a range, specifying the magnitude of negative growth a country must suffer if it is to avoid penalties, is being considered.</p>
<p>While the parameters are still unclear, the objective would be as follows: if the decline in a country's total output fell within the specified range, a vote among EU finance ministers would be taken to determine whether it was an exceptional situation.</p>
<p>A majority would be needed for such a verdict which would then allow the country to avoid fines. If the decline in GDP was beyond the range, no vote would be needed.</p>
<p>Several other items also need to be resolved.</p>
<p>For example, the initial or fixed portion of a fine and whether there should be a maximum amount.</p>
<p>The European Commission proposed in October that there should be both a fixed and variable component to sanctions, with the fixed portion being 0.2 percent of GDP. They also argued for a maximum of 0.5 percent of total output.</p>
<p>On both counts, officials say there is still debate, with Germany resisting the idea of a ceiling.</p>
<p>Apart from negotiations on the details of the stability pact, monetary officials say the EU's legislative process alone precludes the possiblity of an accord this year.</p>
<p>The deliberations of the monetary committee, comprised of national treasury and central bank officials, will form the basis of talks by EU finance ministers on December 2.</p>
