<p>IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said on Wednesday it had raised Daiwa Bank's long-term rating to BBB plus from BBB and its individual rating to D from D/E.</p>
<p>The short-term rating of A2 and legal rating of 2 are unchanged, IBCA said in a statement.  </p>
<p>"The revised ratings reflect more fully the bank's underlying financial condition, although a question mark remains over the longer-term effects of losing its U.S. business and the damage to its reputation," IBCA said.</p>
<p>In November 1995, IBCA lowered Daiwa's long-term and individual ratings following the U.S. regulatory authorities' order to close the bank's operation in the U.S. and the instigation of lawsuits in response to its fraud-related incident at its New York branch.  </p>
<p>"This was an unprecedented crisis for Daiwa and led it into merger talks with Sumitomo Bank. The bank also received a Japan, requiring it to reorganise its operations and management systems," IBCA said.</p>
<p>"Since the beginning of this year, there have been important developments: Daiwa's withdrawal from the U.S. was completed by selling its operations to Sumitomo Bank, while the lawsuits were settled through agreement with U.S. prosecutors in February," said IBCA.  </p>
<p>"This removed the largest immediate threat of further heavy costs to the bank and Daiwa appears to have survived the period of immediate crisis. Results for financial year 1995/96 indicate its core business," the agency said.</p>
<p>"We understand that the merger talks with Sumitomo have ended and the bank is planning its independent future," IBCA said.</p>
