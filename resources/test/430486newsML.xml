<headline>Dollar falls amid doubts about europe's single currency.</headline>

<p>NEW YORK, March 10 -  The dollar fell on Monday against the mark as remarks by German and Italian officials fuelled growing doubts that a single European currency will be launched as planned in 1999.</p>
<p>The dollar also weakened slightly versus the British pound despite fading hopes for higher official interest rates in Britain.</p>
<p>In an interview this weekend with the German weekly newspaper Bild am Sonntag, the German government's top independent economic adviser, Herbert Hax, urged Germany to put off joining the single currency until Germany's own finances were in order. Hax said Germany would likely miss the entry rules on budget deficits and national debt this year.</p>
<p>By contrast, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told delegates to a tourism fair in Berlin on Saturday that Germany would fulfil the criteria and the single currency would start on time.</p>
<p>Under the tough entry standards for European Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU, nations must cut their budget deficits to 3.0 percent of gross domestic product or GDP and public debt to 60 percent of GDP in 1997.</p>
<p>The German government forecast calls for a budget deficit of 2.9 percent this year. Yet, in a speech on Monday, Bundesbank council member Klaus-Dieter Kuehbacher doubted the government would reach its goal, but he did not suggest the single currency should be delayed.</p>
<p>Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini added to the pessimism when he told reporters this weekend that he did not rule out a delay to the decision on who should qualify.</p>
<p>The single currency to be called the euro is due to be launched on January 1, 1999. A decision on which nations will be included as founding members is scheduled to be made early next year.</p>
<p>The mark gained on Monday as scepticism about plans for the euro often enhances its appeal as a safe haven currency. The mark climbed against some European currencies as well as the dollar.</p>
<p>That has been one of the factors that has allowed the mark to strengthen against the dollar in the last 24 hours, said Frank Pusateri, a vice president of corporate foreign exchange at Mellon Bank in Boston.</p>
<p>Pusateri said, "It almost sounds like the more adamant Chancellor Kohl speaks about how there will be no divergence from the timetable or criteria ... the more it's obvious that Germany is not going to make it and they're going to have to delay the entry."</p>
<p>In late New York trading on Monday, the dollar settled at 1.7015 marks, down from 1.7140 marks on Friday. The dollar fell to 121.63 Japanese yen from 121.90 yen.</p>
<p>A British government report released on Monday showed Britain's factory output prices rose in February at their slowest rate for over a decade. The data underscored Bank of England Governor Eddie George's comments earlier in the day that Britain's 2.5 percent inflation goal was within reach.</p>
<p>Initially, the British pound slid as low as $1.5948 in Europe before erasing its losses to trade as high as $1.6059 in New York. In late trading, the pound cost $1.6037, up from $1.6030 on Friday.</p>
<p>The pound weakened because of the good inflation numbers and the further curtailing of expectations regarding interest rate hikes in the United Kingdom, said Ben Strauss, assistant vice president of foreign exchange at Bank Julius Baer and Co.</p>
<p>However, the pound rebounded after some traders who previously had sold the currency rushed to buy it back, while others thought the pound represented a good buy once it traded below $1.60, dealers said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the dollar fell to 1.4715 Swiss francs on Monday from 1.4800 francs on Friday, but rose to Canadian $1.3713 from Canadian $1.3693.</p>
