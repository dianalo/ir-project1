<p>Legislation introduced in the Michigan Legislature this week would allow the state to take over "educationally bankrupt" school districts.</p>
<p>The five-bill package introduced by State Sen. Dan DeGrow, R-Port Huron, would create a mechanism for state intervention in school districts that fail to meet minimum standards for educating students.</p>
<p>The legislation, which is supported by Gov. John Engler, gives the governor the power to declare a school district educationally bankrupt if 50 percent or more of students continuously score low on proficiency tests.</p>
<p>Once the declaration is made, the governor would then appoint a trustee to develop and implement a plan, make decisions over school spending and personnel and have authority to change or repeal district rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the powers and duties of the school board and administration would be suspended under the legislation.</p>
