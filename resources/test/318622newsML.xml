<p>Cuba asked a part of the Cuban exile community on Sunday to join its crusade against the Helms-Burton law which has toughened the longstanding U.S. economic embargo against Havana.</p>
<p>"There are no third positions on this law of the empire," Communist Party Politburo member Jose Ramon Balaguer told the close of a two-day conference with some 130 representatives of the moderate exile community.</p>
<p>"You either oppose it or you agree with it," Balaguer told the meeting, aimed at condemning Helms-Burton.</p>
<p>Balaguer said Cuba hoped this would be the start of more opposition to Helms-Burton among the some one million Cubans living abroad, most of them in the United States.</p>
<p>"The law obliges us all, wherever we are, to make a worthy reply in the face of this clear sign of imposing by law its (Washington's) world hegemony," he said.</p>
<p>The law was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Bill Clinton in March after Cuba shot down two small aircraft, killing four Cuban-Americans on board.</p>
<p>Clinton approved the act with the proviso that he had until July 16 to waive "Title III."</p>
<p>This section would allow naturalized Americans to sue, in U.S. courts, foreign companies deemed to have profited from property confiscated by Havana since the Cuban revolution of 1959.</p>
<p>In July, he suspended the possibility of court action until after the U.S. presidential election in November, which he won.</p>
<p>The law is named after its Republican authors, arch-conservative Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms of North Carolina and Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana.</p>
<p>-- Title I among other things codifies the existing U.S. economic embargo of Cuba, which means that the embargo cannot be lifted by a president without the approval of Congress.</p>
<p>-- Title II authorizes the president to end the embargo only when a "democratic" government is in power on the communist-ruled island and instructs him to draft a plan to provide U.S. assistance to democratic administration.</p>
<p>-- Title III allows lawsuits to be filed in U.S. courts against foreign firms that own or operate the properties of U.S. citizens seized by the government of Cuban President Fidel Castro after the 1959 Cuban revolution.</p>
<p>-- Title IV is the section of the law which allows the United States to bar foreign nationals from entering the U.S. if they are found to be "trafficking" in Cuban property confiscated from U.S. citizens.</p>
<p>Because of this it has drawn criticism from U.S. allies including Canada, Mexico and the European Union.</p>
<p>Havana also objects strongly to other parts of the law, which codify the 35-year-old embargo and demand a radical political overhaul on the communist-ruled island as a condition for better relations between Washington and Havana.</p>
<p>Referring to stated hopes by U.S. officials that Cuba should return to the community of nations, Balaguer said that seeing opposition to Helms-Burton "one has a right to ask oneself if it is not the United States that should return to the community of nations".</p>
<p>The conference also heard several lawyers from Spain and the United States explain why they believe Helms-Burton is contrary to international law.</p>
