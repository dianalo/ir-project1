<p>Western Digital Corp said Tuesday it is comfortable with Wall Street analyst's earnings forecasts for its fourth quarter, ending in June, of $1.85 a share to $1.95 a share.</p>
<p>The consensus among analysts is for fourth quarter earnings of $1.92 a share, according to First Call survey.</p>
<p>Speaking in an interview with CNBC television Chairman, President and Chief Executive Chuck Haggerty said he expects revenue and profits will be up in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, ended in March.  </p>
<p>"As expected, the June quarter has been a more competitive environment in our industry -- albeit nothing extraordinary -- as we head into the seasonally slower summer season," he said.</p>
<p>"However, we remain on plan for sequentially higher unit shipments, revenue and profitability from the March quarter, based on good demand for our Caviar desktop drives, which represent the vast majority of our mix, and a continuation of the ramp-up of our new Enterprise storage business targeted at the server market," he said.  </p>
<p>Haggerty's comments followed a statement on Monday from rival disk drive maker Seagate Technology Inc that its fiscal fourth quarter results would be below expectations due to weak demand for its high-performance computer disk drive products.</p>
<p>Seagate said revenues for the three months ended in June are expected to be between six percent and 10 percent below the $2.5 billion reported for the third quarter ended in March. The company also said earnings before one-time charges could fall short of the third quarter's profit of $1.01 a share.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts had expected the company to earn $1.06 a share in its fiscal fourth quarter, according to the First Call service.</p>
<p>Seagate said the weakness in demand was restricted to the high-end of the market for file servers, where it is losing market share to new entrants such as Western Digital, International Business Machines Corp and Quantum Corp. Seagate said demand for disk drives in the personal computer market remained robust with demand still outstripping supply.  Technology stocks have been volatile in recent weeks on concerns that demand for personal computers is slowing.</p>
