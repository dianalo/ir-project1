<p>The supervisory board of Czech bank IPB a.s. said on Tuesday that it had found no violations by officials of the bank despite confirmation by investigators that two senior officials of IPB had been charged with fraud.</p>
<p>In a statement IPB said that the supervisory board had discussed reports that two unnamed senior officials had been charged but said it "considered the whole matter to be a misunderstanding, about which it is convinced an explanation will be soon forthcoming."  </p>
<p>Zdenek Pichlik, deputy director of the Prague Investigation Office, told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that two senior officials at the bank had been charged but he refused to name them.</p>
<p>"Two leading members of IPB are subject to prosecution," he said adding that the two were formally charged on Tuesday.</p>
<p>IPB press spokesman Jan Rezek also refused to name the officials or comment further on the IPB statement.</p>
<p>Pichlik refused to give details of the charges but said police were not at present considering charging any other individuals.</p>
