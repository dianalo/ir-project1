<headline>CSCE world sugar ends barely up before New Year.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE world sugar futures closed an abbreviated session barely higher, but gains were enough to lift the most-active March contract through key psychological resistance at 11.00 cents.</p>
<p>Fund short-covering carried the contract to a high of 11.02 during the session, where steady trade scale-up selling limited gains, dealers said.</p>
<p>Local traders were mixed in their activity.</p>
<p>One floor source cited sell stops above 11.05 in March and then over 11.10.</p>
<p>The March contract closed at 11.00, up 0.01, while the back months settled 0.01 higher to down 0.02.</p>
<p>Volume was brisk for a short session, estimated at 9,876 lots.</p>
<p>Support remained at the recent low of 10.63 cents made Dec 19, basis the March contract.</p>
<p>The CSCE will reopen Thursday.</p>
