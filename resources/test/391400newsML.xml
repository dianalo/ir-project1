<p>FCOJ futures continued to climb higher on mostly commission house buying despite technical and fundamental signals that point to lower prices, dealers said.</p>
<p>Trade scale-up selling limited gains, they added.</p>
<p>Players await the weekly movement figures from the Florida Citrus Processors Association, released later today. Movement has been consistently weak while Florida is still expected to produce a record 220 million 90-lb boxes.</p>
<p>Technically, resistance was seen between present levels and 87.00 cents in the most-active May contract.</p>
<p>Firm support in May was seen the recent low of 77.50.</p>
<p>May ended up 1.30 cents at 83.80 cents per pound, traded 85.20 to 82.90. Spot March closed 1.35 higher at 81.15 cents.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at 3,750 lots compared with Wednesday's official volume of 3,464 lots.</p>
<p>The last trading day for the spot month is March 10.</p>
<p>Warm weather in Florida's citrus belt is expected to continue through the weekend, forecasters said.</p>
