<p>U.S. spot gas prices, pummeled after rallying to near-record highs last winter, rebounded this spring, and analysts said they expected a fairly tight supply-demand balance to underpin values for most of the year.</p>
<p>While no one was predicting a repeat of last year's surge to $4 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) at Henry Hub, the NYMEX delivery point in Louisiana, most expected prices to steadily inch higher.</p>
<p>"I think we're looking at a fairly supportive price scenario heading into summer," said Susan Bertsch, an analyst at Houston-based consultants Bonner and Moore.</p>
<p>Bertsch said heating demand during a cool spring helped trim bloated stocks left over from a mild winter and set the stage for firmer prices, particularly with a number of nuclear plants likely to remain off line for much of the year.</p>
<p>Since diving to below $1.80 in March, Hub prices have rebounded almost 25 percent to about the $2.20 level.</p>
<p>"The price recovery was not unexpected but the magnitude was. What's driving us now are the nuclear outages," she said.</p>
<p>According to a Reuter report, outages at U.S. nuclear generating plants last week totaled 30,929 megawatts (MW), up 55 percent from a year ago and about 31 percent of the country's overall 99,657 MW nuclear power capacity.</p>
<p>Bertsch said she expected summer prices at Henry Hub to climb to the mid-$2.20s, with 1997 averaging $2.36.</p>
<p>"It pales in comparison to last year's $2.76 average, but it's not bad when you look back over the last few years."</p>
<p>Greg McMichael, senior vice president at Denver-based brokers Hanifen Imhoff, agreed the balance looked delicate.</p>
<p>"The price outlook looks pretty strong for summer months, particularly if we get some normal weather. It doesn't seem like there's much incremental gas," he said.</p>
<p>McMichael said a slump in drilling new natural gas wells were one factor keeping supply and demand tight.</p>
<p>"Until we get well completions at 9,000 or higher for 12 months, you won't see any significant increase in production," he said, noting there were about 8,850 completions last year.</p>
<p>In the first quarter, McMichael said completions were running at an 8,800 pace.</p>
<p>He said U.S. gas production this year would likely rise 2.6 percent to about 19.5 trillion cubic feet (tcf), while imports in 1997 would be 0.6 percent higher at 2.9 tcf.</p>
<p>But with demand also expected to be up two percent this year to 22.5 tcf, McMichael saw a slight shortfall which could push his Midcontinent-Gulf Coast price average to $2.15 this summer and to $2.45 by the fourth quarter, up from a Q2 1997 estimate of $1.95.</p>
<p>And with gas inventories lagging the three-year average, analysts said steady stock building was another factor likely to lend support, noting daily injections of 10.5 billion cubic feet through October were needed to rebuild storage to 2.8 trillion cubic feet by the peak-demand winter heating season.</p>
<p>"We're not in bad shape on storage, but we should see a fairly bullish pace of injections this year," Bertsch said.</p>
<p>Dave Gipson, an analyst at Pace Consultants in Houston, also saw a supportive scenario ahead.</p>
<p>"I think the balance (between supply and demand) has improved over the last couple of years. Things are looking pretty good coming into summer," he said, adding summer gas at the Hub could climb to the $2.50s with hot weather.</p>
<p>For 1997, Gipson expected the Hub to average about $2.30.</p>
<p>But analysts agreed weather remains the wild card, and another mild summer like last year's would mean all bets are off.</p>
