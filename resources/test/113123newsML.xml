<p>Anti-Baghdad Kurdish rebels retook the Kurdish stronghold of Sulaimaniya on Sunday from a faction aligned with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, which accused Iran of intervening in the conflict in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>"Early this morning the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) took over Sulaimaniya from the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) of Massoud Barzani," a source at the U.N. coordinator's headquarters in Baghdad told Reuters.</p>
<p>Barzani accused Iranian forces of helping the PUK retake the key city and called for international aid against "Iran's brutal invasion", Turkey's Anatolian news agency said.</p>
<p>"Since October 10, Iran has started a major invasion of Sulaimaniya province in collaboration with Jalal Talabani," Barzani said in a statement.</p>
<p>But Talabani's PUK denied being aided by Tehran. "We would like to emphatically point out that there is no Iranian involvement or support for our forces in this heroic war of liberation," it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Baghdad urged the rival Kurdish groups to stay away from outside powers, in an apparent reference to Iran.</p>
<p>Saddam chaired a meeting of the Revolutionary Command Council and leaders of the ruling Baath Party to discuss developments in Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>
<p>The official Iraqi News Agency (INA), quoting a spokesman for the meeting, said Iraqi leaders urged the warring Kurdish factions to halt fighting and resume peace talks with Baghdad.</p>
<p>"We call on the parties which have resumed fighting to keep away the foreign powers and not deal with them. We also call on them to start talks between themselves.</p>
<p>"The leadership is ready to extend an invitation to all parties regardless of their background and our opinion or evaluation of this faction or the other, for dialogue in Baghdad, under the sponsorship of the state," INA said.</p>
<p>In Damascus, Bayan Jabr, representative of the Shi'ite Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq which is aligned with the PUK, said in a statement the Kurdish group planned to retake the city of Arbil also.</p>
<p>The U.N. source said forces of PUK leader Talabani had also regained control of Chamchamal to the south and Darbandikhan to the east.</p>
<p>"The area from the Iranian border deep into Iraqi Kurdistan is now in Talabani's hands," the source said. He said all U.N. staff in Sulaimaniya were safe and the city was calm. He said it apparently fell without any armed struggle.</p>
<p>"It is just a new day. KDP is out and PUK is in. Yesterday we had yellow flags today we have green ones," the source said.</p>
<p>Iraqi forces intervened on the side of KDP guerrillas led by Barzani late in August and helped them oust the PUK from Arbil, Iraqi Kurdistan's administrative centre.</p>
<p>Washington, which opposes any military involvement in the area by Saddam, then launched punitive missile strikes against Iraqi air defence targets in southern Iraq.</p>
<p>Reports reaching the U.N. office in Baghdad said KDP rebels had abandoned the city hours before the arrival of Talabani rebels. One source said he did not rule out a deal between the sides: "We have not seen the last act of this drama."</p>
<p>Iraq had accused Talabani of receiving Iranian aid in its battle with KDP rivals and the central government. After Barzani won control of Arbil and Sulaimaniya, Saddam lifted restrictions on movement of people and trade to the Kurdish region.</p>
<p>The fighting a month ago halted plans to implement an oil-for-food agreement between Baghdad and the United Nations because U.N. personnel overseeing the distribution in the north might not be safe.</p>
