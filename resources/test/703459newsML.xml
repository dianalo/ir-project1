<p>Shares in Land Securities Plc and other leading property stocks rose in early trade on Wednesday, as fears eased over possible measures in the budget and buyers came in after recent underperformance, dealers said.</p>
<p>Land Securities shares were squeezed up 17p to 884-1/2 by 0749 GMT in thin volume of 40,393.  </p>
<p>Other property stocks also rose, with British Land Plc up 8-1/2p at 587-1/2 in trade of 304,011 shares, MEPC Plc up 9p at 501 in volume of 1,500, Hammerson Plc up 7-1/2p at 476 in trade of just over 50,000 and Slough Estates Plc up 7p at 295-1/2 in volume of 62,606.</p>
<p>Dealers pointed out that Land Securities and other property stocks had recently underperformed the rest of the UK equity market and that it did not take much buying interest to spark substantial gains in the relatively illiquid sector.</p>
<p>"Anytime there are some buy orders in the system they will get squeezed higher," said one senior dealer.</p>
