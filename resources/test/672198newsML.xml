<p>Here is how major stock markets outside the United States ended on Thursday.</p>
<p>LONDON - Britain's FTSE 100 share index clawed back most of its early losses but failed to clamber into positive territory, suffering its fourth fall in a row with a modest drop of 3.3 points to 4,653.7. The FTSE 100 closed at 4653.7, down 3.3 points, or 0.07 percent.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - Germany's IBIS DAX index rose to within a whisker of the magic 3,800 point level in late trade on Wednesday, with renewed record gains driven by derivatives and with few fundamental reasons for the advance. The DAX-30 index closed at 3749.27, up 19.00 points, or 0.51 percent. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index ended at 3777.56, up 47.00 points, or 1.26 percent.</p>
<p>PARIS - French shares finished down but well above their lows after Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin outlined his government's programme to parliament. The CAC-40 index closed at 2739.69, down 12.05 points, or 0.44 percent.</p>
<p>ZURICH - Swiss shares jumped two percent, driven by massive gains in index-heavyweight Novartis and derivatives-linked buying. The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) ended above 5,500 points for the first time. The Swiss market index closed at 5510.3, up 105.3 points, or 1.95 percent.</p>
<p>MILAN - Italian shares ended firm but slipped back from higher levels in late trade, in the wake of a correction in Btp bond futures, with profit-taking seen on selected major stocks after both the Mib30 blue chip index and the Fib30 futures index had again touched new highs, dealers said. The All Share Mibtel index closed at 13058, up 128 points, or 0.99 percent.</p>
<p>AMSTERDAM - Dutch blue chips swept to a new record close as Wall Street's opening surge gave added support to the AEX, already buoyed by gains in several major component stocks. The AEX index closed at 856.59, up 7.46 points, or 0.88 percent.</p>
<p>HONG KONG - Hong Kong stocks surged, with the blue-chip Hang Seng Index closing above the 14,500 mark on a strong rebound by property and bank stocks, brokers said. The Hang Seng index closed at 14,506.49, up 302.60 points, or 2.13 percent.</p>
<p>SYDNEY - Australian stocks limped through early trade but recovered to reach full stride late in the day and end on their fifth record close in a week. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2693.3, up 19.9 points, or 0.74 percent.</p>
<p>JOHANNESBURG - South African gold shares tumbled to new lows as renewed woes on the international bullion price launched a fresh assault on the already bombed-out index, dealers said. The All-share index closed at 7,209.1, down 9.0 points, or 0.12 percent. The All Gold index closed at 1061.3, down 35.4 points, or 0.02 percent, while the Industrial index closed at 8,433.8, up 1.9 points, or 3.23 percent.</p>
<p>TOKYO - Tokyo stocks ended flat in the Thursday session as most investors retreated to the sidelines ahead of the G7 summit which starts later this week, brokers said.</p>
<p>They added that bargain-hunting was particularly brisk, preventing the Nikkei average from falling too heavily.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 ended 10 points or 0.05 percent higher at 20,507.85.</p>
