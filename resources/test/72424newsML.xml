<p>The president elect of the Bosnian Serb Republic complained to the OSCE on Tuesday over irregularities during September 14 elections and threatened to declare the result invalid unless they were cleared up.</p>
<p>Biljana Plavsic, who swept the poll for president of the Serb entity in Bosnia, wrote to OSCE mission chief Robert Frowick protesting over "Preliminary Final Results" issued on Monday, saying they were based on ballots that arrived days after the polls closed.</p>
<p>"I must inform you that these figures have confirmed our worst fears -- that the election figures are being adjusted to suit someone's political needs, and that this adjustment is being accomplished by way of illegitimate ballots...," she wrote in the letter, which was faxed to Reuters.</p>
<p>She said thousands of ballots had arrived without proper documentation.</p>
<p>"Republika Srpska (Bosnian Serb Republic) cannot accept the subsequent revisions of the election figures, on the basis of mysterious, illegimate voting ballots that kept arriving for days aftger the polls closed," she added.</p>
<p>She warned that if the preliminary figures issued by the OSCE became final, the Serb republic would consider witholding its recognition of the result.</p>
<p>The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which organised the vote, was forced to recount a large part of the vote after detecting major errors by locally-staffed counting houses, but said the recount confirmed the original results putting nationalist parties back in power.</p>
