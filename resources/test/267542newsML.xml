<p>Jean-Pierre Levy, head of one of the largest groups in France's wartime anti-Nazi Resistance movement, has died aged 85, friends said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Levy, who died in Paris on Monday, created and led the Franc-Tireur (Irregular) organisation, one of several large domestic Resistance groups united in 1943 under the command of the London headquarters of General Charles de Gaulle's Free French movement.</p>
<p>Franc-Tireur, armed at first by British intelligence, was active in attacks against German forces and their Vichy French auxiliaries as well as in sabotage activities across France to prevent industrial production from being used in the German war effort.</p>
<p>Levy, who travelled secretly to Britain to meet de Gaulle, was arrested in January 1944 but the Resistance organised his escape from a Paris area prison six months later.</p>
<p>He held top government administrative jobs after the war but stayed largely out of public view except for activities in favour of keeping alive the memory of the Resistance's action.</p>
