<p>Brown Group Inc said Thursday its Famous Footwear division's same-store sales in August rose 10.4 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Total sales for Famous Footwear in August were $95.8 million, up 16.7 percent.</p>
<p>Brown Group said its Naturalizer retail division's total sales increased 2.4 percent in August to $8.6 million. Same-store sales were up 4.2 percent.</p>
<p>"Famous Footwear's 10.4 percent August same-store sales increase confirmed a very encouraging back-to-school season and was substantially higher than planned levels," Harry Rich, chief financial officer, said in a statement. "Following a nine percent increase in July, the double-digit gain reflected particularly strong seasonal branded athletic shoe sales."</p>
