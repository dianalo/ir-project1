<p>A group of U.S. airlines, cities, airports and tourism interests said on Wednesday they had urged the new Transportation Secretary to call for an early resumption of talks to open Japan's closed aviation market.</p>
<p>The group, ACCESS U.S.-Japan, called on Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater during his first week on the job to try to resume talks quickly. The last round was in January.</p>
<p>A U.S. official said then that a new round could be held in February, but no date was set.  </p>
<p>The group, which includes several major U.S. airlines, said a new agreement should authorize more flight to more cities by more airlines between the United States and Japan, with the right to fly to countries beyond.</p>
<p>"It is time for progress in the negotiations," it said.</p>
<p>The current agreement limits U.S. services to Japan and beyond to United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp, and Northwest Airlines Corp.</p>
<p>Members of the ACCESS coalition include American Airlines, a unit of AMR Corp, Delta Air Lines Inc, Continental Airlines Inc, and Trans World Airlines Inc, and airports including those at Miami and Dallas.</p>
