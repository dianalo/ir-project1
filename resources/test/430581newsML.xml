<p>The Clinton administration remains committed to using conservative, credible economic assumptions for budgetary purposes, Janet Yellen, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Adivsers, said in a statement on Monday.</p>
<p>She said that release of the private sector forecasts from the Blue Chip Economic Indicators, showing more buoyant activity than the administration forecast, was further evidence that President Clinton was staying away from rosy scenarios of the past.</p>
<p>"Today's Blue Chip release for real Gross Domestic Product for the next five years is higher than the administration's," Yellen said.</p>
<p>The Blue Chip forecast sees 2.3 percent growth per year over the next five years, compared with 2.2 percent forecast by the administration.</p>
<p>She said the administration's forecast for nominal GDP is similarly conservative, showing 4.9 percnet over the next five years compared with the Blue Chip forecast of 5.0 percent.</p>
<p>"We have submitted a budget that balances by 2002 under our conservative economic assumptions," she said. "The administration looks forward to working with Congressional leaders to reach agreement on balancing the budget by 2002," she added.</p>
