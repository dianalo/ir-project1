<p>Shares in retailer Burton Group Plc fell on Friday after a report in the Independent newspaper said sales were slowing and chief executive John Hoerner was set to step down.</p>
<p>The shares were two pence weaker at 122-1/4 by 0810 GMT.  </p>
<p>"There was a very bearish report in the Independent and that's knocked their share price today," one market-maker said.</p>
<p>The newspaper said Hoerner was a popular figure in the City of London and his departure would be seen as a surprise.</p>
<p>It said his replacement was expected to be Stuart Rose, chief executive of Burton Menswear, Dorothy Perkins, Evans and Principles.</p>
<p>Dealers said the shares had also not been helped by news this week the company would drop out of the FTSE 100 share index from June 23.</p>
