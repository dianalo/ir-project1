<p>Argentina beat the</p>
<p>United States 29-26 in an action-packed thriller, while Canada</p>
<p>downed Uruguay 24-18 in a sluggish match in the opening games</p>
<p>of the four-nation Pan American rugby tournament.</p>
<p>The first game of the double-header ended in heartbreak</p>
<p>for the Americans as Gonzalo Quesada scored a penalty with</p>
<p>less than a minute to go to put his team into a 29-26 lead.</p>
<p>Then, with the final whistle about to go, the Americans</p>
<p>were awarded a penalty -- all they needed to tie the game.</p>
<p>But Matt Alexander, who had already scored four penalties</p>
<p>and two conversions, missed when his skill was most critically</p>
<p>needed.</p>
<p>The second game saw an inexperienced Canada, playing with</p>
<p>seven first-time internationals, against an out-of-shape</p>
<p>Uruguay.</p>
<p>Uruguay went into an early lead with a try by Antonio</p>
<p>Dabbo, but two Bob Ross penalties and a try by Kevin</p>
<p>Wirachowski put the Canadians into an 11-5 lead, an advantage</p>
<p>they would never concede.</p>
<p>The Uruguayans failed to score again in the first half. A</p>
<p>drop goal by Canadian substitute Jason Penaluna and a</p>
<p>conversion by Ross gave the Canadians a halftime lead of 18-5.</p>
<p>Although Uruguay was more aggressive in the second half,</p>
<p>it was too little too late and Canada easily held on to win.</p>
<p>The next double-header is scheduled for Wednesday at</p>
<p>Hamilton, Ontario. The tournament ends with a final</p>
<p>double-header next Saturday in Markham, Ontario.</p>
<p>Canada and Argentina lead after the first day with four</p>
<p>points each for a win, while both Uruguay and Argentina picked</p>
<p>up one consolation point for losing by seven points or less.</p>
