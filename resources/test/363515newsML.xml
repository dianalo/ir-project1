<p>The dollar extended its rally to its highest levels against the German mark and Japanese yen in years on Friday, amid expectations that major industrialised nations would approve of a stronger U.S. currency.</p>
<p>News of a surprisingly weak jobs market failed to curtail the dollar's rally, even though it bolstered expectations that the Federal Reserve will keep interest rates steady for now.</p>
<p>A rate hike would make U.S. assets more attractive to investors by raising their yields.</p>
<p>The U.S. Labour Department said U.S. non-farm payrolls rose to 271,000 in January after gaining a revised 261,000 in December. The jobless rate unexpectedly rose to 5.4 percent from 5.3 percent and January hourly earnings inched up to $12.06 from $12.05 in December.</p>
<p>"It's not something that I think is going to suggest that a rate hike is imminent by any means," said Paul Park, a trader and vice president at Mellon Bank N.A.</p>
<p>Park noted that the dollar had not backed off significantly. "So, you can make a point that the dollar continues to be well bid."</p>
<p>The dollar opened at 1.6673 marks, its highest since June 1994, and well above the 1.6525 mark level set late Thursday, before fetching 1.6720 marks at mid-morning in New York.</p>
<p>Against the yen, the dollar rocketed to 124.56 yen, a fresh four-year high, vs. 123.75 yen late Thursday.</p>
<p>Dealers stressed that the dollar's bullish prospects remained firmly in place.</p>
<p>"(There is) very positive dollar sentiment and that's not going to disappear overnight," said Diego Giurleo, at Royal Bank of Canada. "What set the stage this week was the very weak numbers coming out of the employment sector in Germany," he added.</p>
<p>German jobs data contrasted sharply with the U.S. report.</p>
<p>January unemployment in Germany surged by more than half a million to a new post-war record of 4.66 million. January's jobless rate hit 12.2 percent versus December's 10.8 percent.</p>
<p>With U.S. employment data behind it, the market next faces the meeting of financial leaders of the Group of Seven major industrial powers in Berlin on Saturday. The G7 played a key role in helping the dollar recover after it tumbled to post-World War II lows of 1.3438 marks and 79.75 yen in 1995.</p>
<p>Since then, the dollar has risen more than 55 percent against the yen and nearly 24 percent vs. the mark.</p>
<p>"If you look at what the market's been doing, it's behaving as though they expect the G7 not to do anything to attempt to reverse the dollar's gains," said Bob Lynch, a senior currency analyst at MMS International.</p>
<p>Lynch said the G7 may press for stability in exchange rates. "That's the ultimate objective to reduce the volatility in the market," he said.</p>
<p>Shoichiro Toyoda, chairman of Toyota Motor Corp., said on Friday that for manufacturers, sudden, dramatic fluctuations in the dollar/yen rate are not desirable. He also said a "reasonable range" would be between 100 yen to 120 yen to the dollar.</p>
<p>"Clearly they would be comfortable if the dollar moved down 10 percent," said Thomas Arnold, a vice president and chief dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank.</p>
<p>In other trading, the British pound fell to $1.6245 from $1.6340 late Thursday. The dollar rose to 1.4425 Swiss francs from 1.4260 and slid to Canadian $1.3483 from $1.3499.</p>
