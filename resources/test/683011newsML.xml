<p>Misinterpretation by U.S. politicians and journalists of the return of Hong Kong to China is fuelling Chinese suspicions and threatening Sino-U.S. ties, U.S. analyst Kenneth Lieberthal said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Public comment on China and on the end of British rule in Hong Kong, which reverts to Beijing on July 1, was being turned to domestic political ends, said Lieberthal, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>"I think that our debate over China in the U.S. has become not only ugly, but really almost surreal; surreal in its detachment both from U.S. interests and from the real complexities of life in Asia," Lieberthal told a meeting of the Foreign Correspondents Club of China in Beijing.</p>
<p>"China has become symbol not reality, and there seems to be almost a determination, in many instances, to keep it that way: to keep it simple, to keep it evil, to keep it vivid and then to trash it and use it as a tool in American politics," he said.</p>
<p>The White House was correct in seeing the end of British rule in Hong Kong as an chance to measure Beijing's will to live up to its international responsibilities, but many Congress members and the media took a less reasoned approach, he said.</p>
<p>Far too much U.S. attention was focused on a minority of activists such as pro-democracy campaigner Martin Lee, although they only represented one section of Hong Kong public opinion, Lieberthal said.</p>
<p>"If you look at both our media treatment and our congressional discussion of Hong Kong, effectively we have substituted Martin Lee for the entire population of Hong Kong," he said.</p>
<p>By contrast, future Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa was being wrongly treated as a tool of the Chinese politicians who approved his appointment, when he should be seen as an important voice for the territory in Beijing, Lieberthal said.</p>
<p>Both Chinese and U.S. analysts say Hong Kong is becoming a key issue in sensitive Sino-U.S. relations, which have long been buffeted by disputes over trade, human rights and Taiwan.</p>
<p>U.S. concerns have been raised by moves by future leader Tung to roll back civil and political liberties after the midnight June 30 handover and by China's decision to scrap Hong Kong's current elected legislature.</p>
<p>Beijing rejects all foreign intervention on such issues as interference in its internal affairs.</p>
<p>China was determined to ensure Hong Kong's future prosperity, although it was not yet sure about how to do so, but many in the United States believed Beijing was eager to impose authoritarian rule, Lieberthal said.</p>
<p>Such misguided views and the mistaken belief that Hong Kong had long been a democratic haven were fuelling suspicions in China, which was already saw ulterior motives in the actions of the departing British administration, he said.</p>
<p>"I think our almost constant articulation of this in our media and (in Congress) has made the Chinese begin to wonder what are our real intentions on Hong Kong, and whether they should distrust us as much as they distrust the British," he said.</p>
<p>China's poor public image made it hard for President Bill Clinton to build a constructive policy toward Beijing, and thousands of often poorly informed journalists in Hong Kong for the handover were likely to make things worse, Lieberthal said.</p>
<p>"If Hong Kong reversion goes very smoothly, the press in the U.S. will be very bad. If it goes badly, the press in the U.S. will be disastrous," Lieberthal said.</p>
