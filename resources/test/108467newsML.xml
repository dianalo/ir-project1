<p>Enron Corp. said Thursday its profits grew by 22 percent in the third quarter on strong earnings growth by its natural gas marketing and pipeline service operations.</p>
<p>Enron, one of the world's largest integrated natural gas and electricity companies, said its net income in the three months ended Sept. 30 expanded to $122.9 million, or 48 cents a share, from $100.6 million, or 40 cents a share.</p>
<p>The Houston-based company said its third-quarter revenues soared to $3.2 billion from $2.2 billion on strong increases in volume sales of natural gas and electricity.</p>
<p>"As natural gas and electricity markets converge, (our) unique ability to tailor broad based commodity solutions to meet customer needs has been extremely successful," Chairman Kenneth L. Lay said in a statement.</p>
<p>Enron operates the largest natural gas transmission system in the Western Hemisphere and the second-largest in the world. It also produces and markets natural gas liquids worldwide.</p>
<p>For the first nine months, Enron said net income grew by 16 percent to $452.4 million, or $1.79 a share, from $389.6 million, or $1.55 a share.</p>
<p>Revenues for the nine months ballooned to $9.2 billion from $6.6 billion.</p>
<p>The company also said it expected to resume full-scale construction on its power project in Dabhol, India, in the very near future, after resolution of the only remaining lawsuit related to the once-controversial project</p>
<p>It also said it had completed financing on a power project in Turkey and construction had begun.</p>
<p>Enron's stock lost 25 cents to $41.125 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
