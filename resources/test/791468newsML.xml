<p>Boeing Co. has invested $11 million for a 9.1 percent stake in a China-based venture that maintains and repairs jets for several Asian airlines, officials of the aerospace giant said Monday.</p>
<p>Boeing officials said they hoped the investment in Taikoo (Xiamen) Aircraft Engineering Co. Ltd., would help meet growing demand for repair and maintenance of its planes in China, which has been rapidly expanding its commercial fleet.</p>
<p>In addition, the venture could strengthen Boeing's relationships with Cathay Pacific Airways, Singapore Airlines, Japan Airlines and China's Civil Aviation Administration, which also own stakes.</p>
<p>The aircraft maintenance group, known as TAECO, is managed by Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co. Ltd., its largest shareholder and a unit of Swire Pacific of Hong Kong, which also owns Cathay Pacific.</p>
<p>In addition to maintaining and repairing Boeing 747, 737 and 757 jets, TAECO, based in China's Fujian province, will have the capability of modifying up to three older 747 jumbo jets annually from passenger to all-cargo configuration, the companies said in a statement.</p>
<p>Boeing has done 75 conversions of Boeing 747-200s since 1989 at its facilities in Wichita, Kan. Boeing workers from Wichita would travel to China to oversee any conversions there.</p>
<p>The investment is the latest move by Boeing to expand through joint ventures into areas related to its core business of manufacturing commercial jets.</p>
<p>Boeing Enterprises, a unit of the Boeing's commercial airplane group, was established this year to explore such opportunities and has completed several deals, including a $200 million joint training venture with FlightSafety International.</p>
<p>In April, Boeing Enterprises President Larry Clarkson said the unit was planning an aircraft maintenance venture, but he denied reports that Boeing was moving rapidly to take over the heavy maintenance operations of one or more major carriers.</p>
