<p>Cameroon's national assembly approved the 1997/98 budget on Tuesday despite a walkout by the main opposition Social Democratic Front (SDF), which described it as unlawful and unrealistic.</p>
<p>President Paul Biya's Cameroon People's Democratic Rally (RDPC) holds 109 of the Central African nation's 180 national assembly seats.</p>
<p>"This budget was conceived with a purely propaganda objective, to give the illusion of the announced five percent economic growth by President Paul Biya which doesn't exist," SDF's finance commission vice-chairman Fopoussi Fotso said.</p>
<p>"This is simply an acrobatic budget where the government budgets only through hypothetical external loans," he said, adding the government had been unable to say whether it had received such projected funds in the 1996/97 year.</p>
<p>Economic analysts say expected contributions from donors did not materialise. The 1996/97 budget was supposed to balance at 1,113 billion CFA francs.</p>
<p>SDF parliamentary group leader Mbah Ndam accused the government of flouting parliamentary procedure.</p>
<p>The budget targets Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth of 5.5 percent in the coming budget year with inflation of just three percent.</p>
<p>GDP growth in the 1996 calendar year, the latest for which official figures are available, was five percent, while inflation was eight percent.</p>
<p>The budget, presented by Prime Minister Peter Musonge Mafany on July 4, envisages a 13 percent increase in spending on the 1996/97 (ended June 30) budget year -- which Biya extended by one month by decree.</p>
<p>The prime minister said that the government aimed to balance the budget at 1,256.75 billion CFA francs with receipts matching spending.</p>
<p>Education gets the lion's share of spending -- up to 95 billion CFA from 55 billion. Defence followed, up from 57 billion CFA to 73.5 billion CFA.</p>
<p>Biya, who took over from independence president Ahmadou Ahidjo in 1982, seeks reelection in October. He narrowly defeated SDF leader John Fru Ndi in a 1992 election, which the opposition says was rigged.</p>
<p>Biya's party won a crushing majority in a May 17 parliamentary election, which the opposition says was also rigged.</p>
<p>Fru Ndi's SDF won 43 seats, the remainder are divided among five other parties.</p>
<p>SDF national assembly members initially spoke of boycotting parliament but took their seats on the advice of Western diplomats.</p>
<p>State radio reported on June 28 that the budget year extension would run from July 1 to 31 with a budget of one twelfth of the 1996/97 allocation.</p>
<p>Officials attributed the delay in the budget debate to postponement of the parliamentary election from March to May.</p>
<p>Cameroon's new parliament did not hold its inaugural session until June 17.</p>
