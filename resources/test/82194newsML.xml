<p>Israeli security forces stormed Jerusalem's Temple Mount during protests after Moslem prayers on Friday, killing at least one Palestinian, witnesses and hospital sources said.</p>
<p>Palestinians threw stones injuring five Israeli policemen, witnesses said.  </p>
<p>Witnesses said many Palestinians were injured. Women retreated into the Dome of the Rock after being beaten. Makassed hospital officials in East Jerusalem confirmed one Palestinian was killed.</p>
<p>Police fired rubber bullets and tear gas.</p>
<p>The violence was triggered by Israel's decision to open a tunnel for tourists adjacent to the Temple Mount, Islam's third holiest site.</p>
<p>Israeli cabinet secretary Danny Naveh said after the cabinet met on Friday that police had closed the tunnel temporarily for security reasons but he said the tunnel would not be permanently shut.</p>
