<headline>Madrid stocks close up strongly, recoup ground.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-03-25</dateline>

<p>Madrid stocks ended strongly higher on Tuesday recouping ground lost in recent sessions' weakness, inspired by gains abroad, dealers said.</p>
<p>Most buying was technically-based, and influenced by end-quarter position-adjusting. But many awaited the outcome of the FOMC, with the consensus pointing to a U.S. rate hike.</p>
<p>The general index added 7.34 points, 1.57 percent, to 474.30 and the Ibex rose 89.4 points, 1.67 percent, to 5,438.76.</p>
<p>Telefonica added 70 pesetas to 3,450 pesetas, recovering after recent weakness, and helped in part by unconfirmed reports of a favourable tariff adjustment, dealers said.</p>
<p>Energy group Repsol added 100 pesetas to 5,900, ahead of the sale of the State's last 10 percent stake, due after Easter.</p>
<p>Trade was heavy, but concentrated in fewer dealers than usual as many had already started Easter holidays. Interest from both traders and final investors was directed mainly to key stocks Repsol and Telefonica, dealers said.</p>
<p>All eyes are on the U.S. Federal Reserve, with the market widely anticipating a 25 basis point hike in the Fed Funds rate.</p>
<p>Some say this is already factored into prices, but in any case investors will be on the alert for any surprises.</p>
