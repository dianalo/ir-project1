<p>China's giant Three Gorges dam project has absorbed 19.2 billion yuan ($2.31 billion) in investment since 1993, the Xinhua news agency said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The project to build a 175-metre-high (570 ft) dam across the mighty Yangtze River would cost at least 90 billion yuan, the official agency said.</p>
<p>It gave no further details of the investment already spent on the project, which officials will cost at least 240 billion yuan by the time it is completed in 2009 if interest and inflation are taken into account.</p>
<p>Contractors preparing the ground for what will be the world's biggest water control project had already moved 178 million cubic metres (237 cubic yards) of earth and stone, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>Officials of the China Three Gorges Project Development Corp said last year they faced a funding shortage of one-sixth of the dam's multi-billion dollar price tag, but have vowed to complete it even if sought-after foreign funding fails to materialise.</p>
