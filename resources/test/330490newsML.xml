<p>Meredith Corp said its pending acquisition of four television stations from First Media Television L.P. is expected to be dilutive to earnings by about $0.30 to $0.35 a share in fiscal 1998.</p>
<p>"We'll reduce that number by approximately half in fiscal 1999, and we expect to be in the black (or accretive to earnings) in fiscal 2000," chief financial officer Larry Hartsook told analysts in a teleconference, the company said.</p>
<p>Hartsook  said all of the dilution will be from amortization of goodwill and other intangibles.  </p>
<p>Meredith, a media company involved in broadcasting and magazine publishing, said earlier Friday, pending regulatory approval, it will acquire all of the television stations of First Media for $435 million, or about 13.5 times estimated calendar 1997 broadcast cash flow.</p>
<p>The First Media stations are WCPX (CBS), Orlando, Fla.; KPDX (FOX), Portland, Ore.; KFXO (FOX), Bend, Ore., and WHNS (FOX), Greenvilkle, S.C.-Asheville, N.C.</p>
