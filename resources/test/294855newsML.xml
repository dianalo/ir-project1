<p>Richard Branson's hopes of becoming the first person to circle the globe in a balloon were threatened on Wednesday by a technical problem which looks set to force him to land in North Africa, mission officials said.</p>
<p>Britain's Press Association news agency quoted the officials as saying the British tycoon's balloon was likely to make a forced landing within the next few hours.</p>
<p>The balloon was expected to land at 0600 GMT in Algeria, about 50-70 miles (80-110 km) east of the border with Morocco, project director Mike Kendrick told the agency in London.</p>
<p>"We have no reason to believe it will not be a normal and successful landing," Kendrick added.</p>
<p>The Press Association said it meant Branson's hopes of breaking "the last great aviation record left on earth" looked set to end in failure. Mission officials said rescue services in Algeria had already been alerted.</p>
<p>Kendrick said Branson had contacted him by radio telephone from the balloon about the technical problem. "Richard said, typically: 'I am sorry to disappoint you, Mike, we are having to land. We have got a duration problem. Please say sorry to everybody, and we will talk to you later'."</p>
<p>Branson and co-pilots Per Lindstrand and Alex Ritchie lifted off from an air base near the Moroccan city of Marrakesh on Tuesday in what is believed to be the world's biggest balloon.</p>
<p>"This is one of the most magnificent adventures that anyone could have in their lifetime," Branson told reporters before lift-off.</p>
<p>At his mission control centre in London, a spokeswoman said the team had spent their first few hours aloft getting to know how to handle their balloon, the Virgin Global Challenger.</p>
<p>They then headed up into the jetstream they hoped would carry them across North Africa, Saudi Arabia, India, the South China Sea, the Pacific and the United States before landing in Britain after a 24,000-mile (38,600 km) trip expected to take between 14 and 21 days.</p>
<p>Speaking from aboard the the 1.1 million cubic feet (30,000 cubic metres) balloon, filled with hot air and helium, Branson said they had reached 38,000 feet (11,500 metres).</p>
<p>"We're on our way," he said, heading over the Algerian border.</p>
<p>He said the flight had got off to a shaky start, but the venture was back on course.</p>
<p>"It was a little bit of a hairy launch. The balloon went up a little bit faster than we thought, about 2,000 feet a minute, and started spewing helium. We seemed to head off in the wrong direction, but all was well in the end."</p>
<p>Branson has been racing against American balloonist Steve Fosset who is planning a similar round-the-world attempt, launched from Switzerland.</p>
<p>Ritchie replaced Rory McCarthy as a co-pilot at the last minute after McCarthy suffered a sudden attack of bronchitis which doctors feared could turn into pneumonia.</p>
<p>Branson, flamboyant 46-year-old head of the Virgin group of companies, has launched an airline and products ranging from condoms to cola and pensions.</p>
<p>His planned dawn takeoff was delayed by the complexities of inflating the giant balloon, a task taking over 12 hours.</p>
<p>He had to cancel a previous attempt to fly round the globe from Marrakesh last January because of bad weather. He has already crossed the Atlantic and Pacific by balloon.</p>
<p>The record for the furthest flown by a manned balloon is 8,382 km (5,208 miles) from Japan to California, set by American Ben Abruzzo and three co-pilots in 1981.</p>
