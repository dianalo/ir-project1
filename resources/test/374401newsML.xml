<p>-- Fator Securities said in a report it was downgrading Sao Paulo state-owned power utility Eletropaulo to hold from buy.  </p>
<p>-- It said Eletropaulo shares have reached a fair value, noting the stock would have a restricted outlook following its 53.1 percent rise in the year.</p>
<p>-- "However, we would stress that our forecasts are not taking into consideration significant operational changes which should come about only after privatization," it added.</p>
<p>-- Eletropaulo preferred B shares were trading at 234.01 reais, down 0.42 percent.</p>
