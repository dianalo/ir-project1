<p>The Maritime Union of Australia said on Wednesday it had imposed bans on Indonesian cargo and shipping in protest against the arrest of two Indonesian independent labour leaders.  </p>
<p>"The bans are to protest against the recent arrests of independent labour leaders Muchtar Pakpahan and Dita Sari and the continuing repression following the July riots in Jakarta," the union said in a statement.</p>
<p>The first ship to be hit by the irregular bans will be the Bogasari Empat, due to arrive in Fremantle on the Western Australia coast on Wednesday to load wheat, it said.</p>
<p>The bans are also a response to Australian Prime Minister John Howard's failure in Jakarta this week to press Indonesia on the issue of human rights and democracy, the union said.</p>
<p>Pakpahan has been charged with subversion in connection with riots that rocked the Indonesian capital on July 27. The crime of subversion is punishable by death. Five people died and 149 were injured in the riots, Indonesia's official Human Rights Commission has said.</p>
