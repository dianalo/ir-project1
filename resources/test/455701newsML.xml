<p>U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Thursday praised South Africa's spirit of reconciliation in the post-apartheid period, saying the country is "too busy to hate".</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton's wife, in an appearance at the University of Cape Town, also predicted that the United States would elect a woman president within the next 20 years.</p>
<p>Speaking 31 years after U.S. Senator Robert Kennedy delivered a landmark address in South Africa on racial inequality, Mrs Clinton said Americans found inspiration in the work going on in the country to put the past behind it.</p>
<p>"We have an old saying in America that idle hands are the devil's work. From what I have seen in just a few short days, the devil will have no help here. South Africa is a country that is too busy to hate," she said.</p>
<p>She was to join President Nelson Mandela later on Thursday on a tour of Robben Island where he spent 18 of his 27 years as a political prisoner.</p>
<p>In a question-and-answer session, Mrs Clinton was asked whether she believed the United States would soon elect a woman as president.</p>
<p>She produced chuckles among the audience of students and representatives of women's groups when she replied: "I have thought a lot about this."</p>
<p>She said it was difficult in the United States to overcome preconceived notions and stereotypes about political leaders, and this made it hard for a woman to rise to the highest level of government.</p>
<p>"Having said that, I do hope and believe that sometime within the next 20 years we will have a woman president," she said.</p>
<p>She said it was possible some women might run in presidential elections in the year 2000, adding there were many well-qualified women who could undertake such a campaign.</p>
<p>In her address, she also hailed a trend towards democracy in Africa, mentioning Uganda, Eritrea and Mozambique.</p>
<p>"Yet nowhere has the triumph of the human spirit -- the power of love to conquer hate -- been greater than in South Africa," she said.</p>
<p>"Here the spirit of reconciliation has enabled a nation of diverse peoples to overcome 40 stubborn and violent years of apartheid and begin the difficult journey to democracy."</p>
<p>The success of democracy in South Africa would not depend solely on free elections, an open market, government policies nor foreign investment, she said.</p>
<p>"It will depend ultimately on the internalisation of democratic values in people's hearts, minds and everyday lives."</p>
<p>Mrs Clinton also announced that the United States was expanding support for a campaign to eradicate polio in Africa by the year 2000. She said the United States would commit a further $16 million to the effort.</p>
