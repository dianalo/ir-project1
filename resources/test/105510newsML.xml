<p>The FBI has arrested three men suspected of taking part in a series of bombings and bank robberies in the Spokane area this year, officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The three men, arrested at a convenience store by federal and state agents near the central Washington city of Yakima Tuesday, were scheduled to be arraigned in U.S. District Court in Spokane, a court clerk said.</p>
<p>The men are expected to be charged with attempted bank robbery and explosives possession in two robberies in four months at the same bank branch, both of which were preceded by diversionary bombings.</p>
<p>FBI officials had no immediate comment but said they planned a news conference later in the day.</p>
<p>In April a suburban Spokane newspaper branch office was bombed, and less than 30 minutes later masked gunmen dressed in camouflage fatigues stormed into a nearby U.S. Bank branch, got away with an undisclosed amount of cash and set off another explosive device.</p>
<p>In July a bomb was tossed through the plate-glass door of a Planned Parenthood office shortly before the same bank branch was robbed by three masked men.</p>
<p>There were no injuries and only minor damage in the attacks.</p>
<p>Federal authorities said the attacks appeared to be the work of the same people. In the April attacks, notes were left on behalf of the white supremacist Phineas Priesthood, and one gunman shouted words of support for the anti-government Freemen then holed up on ranch in Montana.</p>
<p>But FBI agents said they were not certain whether the crimes were simple bank robberies or politically motivated.</p>
<p>On Tuesday FBI agents converged on a convenience store in Union Gap, Washington, backed by authorities from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, the Washington State Patrol, local police and a nearby Army base and arrested the three men, who had stopped for gas.</p>
<p>The agents reportedly had followed the suspects from Portland after getting tipped off about a possible bank robbery at a U.S. Bank branch there. The robbery was foiled when FBI agents called bank executives and warned them to close the branch, the Spokane Spokesman-Review said.</p>
<p>"When the robbers walked up to the bank, the doors were locked, so they just left," an unidentified law enforcement source told the newspaper.</p>
<p>Bank officials declined to comment.</p>
