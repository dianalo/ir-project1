<p>Dow Jones &amp; Co stock tumbled Monday amid news the company planned to spend $650 million to expand and revitalize its Telerate financial information services unit.</p>
<p>Several analysts, who were briefed by company executives in the morning, said they were taken aback by the amount of money needed to turn around the unit.</p>
<p>The company's stock fell 4-1/2 points. to 36-3/8, by early afternoon.  </p>
<p>"Wall Street is a little shocked at the expenditures to fix Telerate," Oppenheimer &amp; Co analyst Edward Atorino said.</p>
<p>Dow Jones said it would invest the $650 million over the next 36 to 48 months. Dow Jones also reported earnings Monday of $1.96 per share for 1996, flat with the year-earlier level.</p>
<p>Company executives in a conference call with analysts said the investment would hurt its earnings in 1997 and 1998.</p>
<p>Dow Jones projected 1997 earnings per share could be in the $1.20 to $1.40 per share range after Telerate investment costs.  </p>
<p>But the company expects its earnings to rebound in 1999 with Dow Jones likely reaching record levels of cash flow and revenues by 2000, Chairman and Chief Executive Peter Kann said during the conference.</p>
<p>"We recognize we have slipped some in this business recently relative to our competitors," he said. "We intend to reverse that situation."</p>
<p>He also addressed the cost of the investment in Telerate. "Make no mistake. It will be a costly program," Kann said during the call.  </p>
<p>Several analysts also said that part of the drop in the stock price can be pegged to a market correction. Last week, Dow Jones's stock gained 3-1/8, to 38-7/8, after a Fortune magazine article detailed efforts among younger members of the family who control the media company to push management to improve shareholder value.</p>
<p>"It went up for a strange reason," Oppenheimer's Attorino said.</p>
<p>Offered Smith Barney analyst Steven Barlow, The market has "taken all (of the gain) back and rightfully so."  </p>
<p>Barlow said analysts had been curious since October what Dow Jones planned to do with Telerate and how much it would be willing to invest in the unit.</p>
<p>"I didn't think it would be this high a number," Barlow said. "It obviously hurts earnings two years in the short term."</p>
<p>Whether the investment will succeed is uncertain, he said.</p>
<p>"They've got a lot of rowing ahead," Barlow said.</p>
<p>Dow Jones competes with Reuters Holdings PLC and Bloomberg LP in major financial markets. Reuters ADRS were off 1-1/8 to 66-3/8 in afternoon trading.</p>
