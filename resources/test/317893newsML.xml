<p>Halliburton Energy Services Inc said it agreed to provide the capital and project management to develop Mobil Corp's Parks Devonian Field in the Permian Basin.</p>
<p>The Halliburton Co subsidiary said it will be compensated from its undisclosed interest in the production from the wells drilled.  It said the agreement allows Mobil to speed its cash flow from the discovery while focusing its capital resources in other areas.</p>
<p>Halliburton said the initial agreement includes five horizontal wells to be completed in 1997.  </p>
<p>It said the agreement will potentially lead to full development of the field with 15 horizontal wells.</p>
<p>"This agreement is indicative of Halliburton's willingness to move beyond the traditional provision of its products and services to the broader role of solutions provider and development partner," the company said.</p>
<p>It quoted Mobil Exploration and Production U.S. Inc busines unit leader J.S. Byth as saying the agreement "allows Mobil to develop the Parks field and at the same time focus our capital and resources elsewhere."</p>
<p>Halliburton said the agreement brings together its horzontal drilling and completion technology and experience with Mobil's specific expertise in the Parks Devonian.</p>
<p>Halliburton said it will be the project manager and lead contractor with Mobil providing wellsite supervision and wellbore construction engineering.</p>
<p>Halliburton said it will also provide the drilling and completion rigs, wellsite facilities, subsurface products and services, and all third party services necessary to complete the project.   ((-- Jim Brumm 212-859-1710.))</p>
