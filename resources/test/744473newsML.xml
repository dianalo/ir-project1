<p>Swedish drugs company Astra is planning to open a research centre in Australia as part of an expansion programme, a Swedish newspaper said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Astra plans to take on 700 new research staff in Sweden and overseas as it reshapes its research programme over the next three years, Svenska Dagbladet said.</p>
<p>Currently Astra has about 750 reseachers in Sweden and 250 overseas and an annual research budget of about eight billion crowns, the paper said.</p>
<p>But Astra intends to take on a further 400 researchers in Sweden and 300 elsewhere, concentrating its work in six centres, of which five will be in Sweden and one in Australia, the paper said.</p>
<p>"My aim is to make Astra the best in the world in pre-clinical research," Jan Lundberg, head of the Astra's pre-clinical division, told the paper.</p>
<p>He said half of Astra's annual research budget is spent testing new drugs, while a large part of its resources go towards getting approval for new treatments.</p>
<p>About two billion crowns a year is spent on further research on drugs that have already been approved.</p>
