<p>CBOT old crop soyoil and soymeal futures were called to open higher on Monday while new crop months were seen lower following expected moves in soybeans, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Trade was expected to be volatile after the U.S. Agriculture Department on Monday pegged 1997 U.S. soybean acreage at 70.85 million acres, the highest since 1982 and above trade expectations for 68.4 million.</p>
<p>But USDA's quarterly stocks data was construed as bullish for old crop months. USDA put June 1 stocks of soybeans at 499 million bushels.</p>
<p>That was the lowest since 1989 and below trade expectation for 516 million bushels.</p>
<p>In Project A overnight trade, soymeal was down $1.90 to $0.20 per ton while soyoil was off 0.20 to 0.14 cent per lb.</p>
