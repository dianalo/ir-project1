<p>The Philippines' powerful Roman Catholic church, which was instrumental in the ouster of strongman Ferdinand Marcos more than a decade ago, has vowed to oppose a second term for President Fidel Ramos.</p>
<p>"We will be there to stop it. We will be calling on the real people power to object," church spokesman Monsignor Hernando Coronel said on Wednesday evening, referring to the church-backed "people power" revolt in 1986 that led to Marcos's downfall.</p>
<p>Coronel squabbled with organisers of the campaign to give Ramos another term during a heated television debate.</p>
<p>The discussion dramatised the deep divisions provoked by calls to amend the constitution to allow Ramos to run again after his six-year term expires in June 1998.</p>
<p>The current constitution, adopted following Marcos's ouster after 21 years in power, limits the president to a single six-year term and other elected officials to no more than two terms.</p>
<p>A small group of army rebels sparked the 1986 uprising by breaking away from Marcos and lending their support to opposition leader and future president Corazon Aquino. One of the rebels was Ramos himself, who was Marcos's national police chief at the time.</p>
<p>The country's top clergyman, Manila Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin, played a key role in the uprising by calling on Filipinos to take to the streets to protect the rebels against advancing Marcos tanks.</p>
<p>Crowds of ordinary citizens estimated at more than one million responded to Sin's call, later forcing Marcos to flee to Hawaii and catapulting Aquino to the presidency.</p>
<p>She gave way to Ramos at the time of the 1992 presidential elections.</p>
<p>Coronel said during the television debate that removing term limits could lead to "totalitarianism, warlordism and political dynasties... We are opening the gates to Marcosian dictatorship."</p>
<p>"That's complete nonsense," Carmen Pedrosa, a leader of the re-elect Ramos campaign, retorted.</p>
<p>The campaign for another Ramos term was launched last week by a previously unknown group called the People's Initiative for Reform, Modernisation and Action (PIRMA), which aims to gather five million signatures in support of term-limit extensions.</p>
<p>The group recently took out advertisements in national newspapers voicing concern that economic reform programmes launched by Ramos might not survive him if he leaves in 1998.</p>
<p>Experts have credited Ramos's liberalisation programme for the country's robust economic growth in recent years.</p>
<p>Ramos on Wednesday reiterated he had no plans to run for a second term but rejected opposition calls that he put his pledge in writing, saying that to do so would be unbecoming of a president.</p>
<p>Sin, addressing civic leaders, said unlimited terms for politicians in the past had resulted in the rise of dynasties and "effectively killed democracy".</p>
<p>"We must not forget the darkness of the past," Sin said.</p>
<p>Aquino on Wednesday joined in against amending the constitution, saying: "It will be very divisive."</p>
<p>She said that despite moves by some groups to endorse a Ramos re-election, "I believe that President Ramos means it when he says that he would step down in 1998."</p>
