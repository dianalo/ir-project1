<p>Poland flaunted its charms to East Asian businesses and officials meeting in Warsaw on Monday, in hopes of boosting its low trade with the booming region, correcting its deficit and luring investment.</p>
<p>"We should target a realistic aim of increasing Asia's share in Poland's exports from the present 2.5 percent to five percent...in the first decade of the next century," Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz told the start of the two-day First Poland-South East Asia Economic Forum.</p>
<p>Poland has modelled its rapid transformation after the 1989 fall of communism partly on the Asian Tiger economies -- though Polish Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko told the delegates: "We call our economy the soaring Eagle of Europe."</p>
<p>But its growing trade with the region remains small and Poland feels that it is not luring its share of Asian capital.</p>
<p>In 1995 Poland's trade with East Asia was $2.6 billion representing only four to five percent of its total, compared with Western Europe which accounts for about 70 percent of turnover, foreign trade ministry figures show.</p>
<p>The region accounted for 6.9 percent or $2 billion of Poland's imports and 2.4 percent of exports -- $568 million.</p>
<p>"Economic and trade relations are only beginning, but they are growing rapidly," said Mauricio de Maria y Campos, Director General of the United Nations Development Organisation (UNIDO) which helped to organise the conference.</p>
<p>In 1989-1994 trade between Poland and the region grew by 70 percent, and from 1994 to 1995 by over 25 percent, he said.</p>
<p>In terms of investment in Poland, Asia accounts for less than two percent.</p>
<p>South Korea leads with $139.5 million invested, mostly for cars and truck production, and a further 1.2 billion pledged, Polish Foreign Investment Agency (PAIZ) figures show.</p>
<p>It is followed by Hong Kong, Singapore, China and only then Japan, though Polish officials hope this economic giant, so far preoccupied with Asia, is now turning to their own region.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Kolodko stressed to potential Asian investors that Poland, bound for European Union membership, could be a springboard to other West and East European markets.</p>
<p>Arief Adang, responsible for European trade at Indonesia's Ministry of Industry and Trade, agreed that Poland could be a bridge into a difficult European market.</p>
<p>"If Poland becomes a member of the EU and Indonesia can establish a link with Poland beforehand, we hope we can expand on the European market," he told Reuters, adding that Indonesia was considering direct investment in Poland's textiles.</p>
<p>Ministers or officials from Hong Kong, Vietnam, Malaysia, Laos, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand are among delegates from 15 Southeast Asian countries in Warsaw.</p>
<p>There are senior observers from China, Japan and South Korea, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia -- Poland's partners in the Central European Free Trade Agreement who share its yearnings for Asian business.</p>
<p>The forum gathers about 180 Polish and 70 foreign firms, studying 141 concrete trade proposals and 64 for investment.</p>
