<p>The head of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) began a three-day visit to Russia on Monday to discuss ways of strengthening security on the continent, Itar-Tass news agency said.</p>
<p>Tass quoted Russian foreign ministry spokesman Vladimir Andreyev as saying OSCE Secretary-General Giancarlo Aragona would meet Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov, parliamentary leaders and members of the presidential administration.</p>
<p>"This is the first visit by the secretary-general of the organisation, to which we assign a central role in ensuring European security and stability," Andreyev said.</p>
<p>"During the talks it is planned to discuss a wide range of issues on strengthening the OSCE and increasing its efficiency."</p>
<p>Moscow has proposed making OSCE a more powerful security body to act as a counterweight to NATO, but its efforts have been rebuffed.</p>
<p>The Viennna-based OSCE seeks to prevent conflicts and ease tensions while promoting democracy, arms control and human rights in Europe.</p>
<p>The OSCE has a delegation in the rebel region of Chechnya, where the organisation mediated in the nearly two-year conflict between Russian troops and separatist guerrillas. Tass did not say whether the delegation's role would be discussed.</p>
