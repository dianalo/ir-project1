<p>PolyGram NV, announcing that full-year 1996 operating profit would be flat or slightly lower than in 1995 and that it would additionally take a $90 million restructuring charge in 1996, said it had been affected by sluggish music markets but also by issues specific to PolyGram.</p>
<p>It said its plans to address these problems would include the following steps:</p>
<p>* Restructuring Motown's operations including management changes, the high cost of the A&amp;R overhaul to revitalise the artist roster and expenses associated with moving Motown's headquarters to New York from Los Angeles;</p>
<p>* Reorganising Europe's music distribution and marketing operations in response to a flat market;</p>
<p>* Restructuring the classical music division.</p>
<p>PolyGram said that at present its film business was expected to proceed according to plan.</p>
<p>The company, majority owned by Philips Electronics NV , is due to announce its 1996 results on February 12, 1997.</p>
