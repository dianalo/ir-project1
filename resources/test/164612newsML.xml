<p>Jordanian shares fell for a seventh consecutive trading day on Monday in the quietest business since January as investors shunned Amman's becalmed bourse.</p>
<p>The Amman Financial Market 60-share index fell 0.13 percent to 147.74 points after shares worth a paltry 202,000 dinars ($285,000) changed hands.</p>
<p>"There's no outside interest. All the business today was between floor traders," said one broker.</p>
<p>Only six companies registered a turnover of more than 10,000 dinars. Arab Bank Group, which accounts for one third of capitalisation on the exchange, led the way with 24,000 dinars worth of trade. It fell 0.50 dinars to 246.50 dinars.</p>
<p>Falling shares outnumbered risers by 19 to seven. Twelve shares traded but closed unchanged.</p>
<p>"In spite of the attractive prices of many stocks to buy, local institutional investors are still cautious of getting heavily involved in the market," financial group Pearl Consulting said in a market report.</p>
<p>Brokers said there was little chance this week of a reverse in the declining trend.</p>
<p>Only General Investment bucked the trend, rising five percent for the third day in a row to close at 3.34 dinars. But brokers said the rarely traded stock was being pushed higher by low-volume transactions between major shareholders.</p>
<p>The official AFM index has been little changed since early October, trading between 146.5 and 149 points. Fears over stalled Palestinian-Israeli negotiations and neighbouring Iraq's continued absence from international oil markets have combined with domestic pessimism to cramp bourse activity.</p>
