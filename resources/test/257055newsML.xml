<p>Despite recent volatility in the stock market, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said on Saturday that stock prices over the long run will reflect the health and future prospects for the economy, which he said were good.</p>
<p>Rubin said Clinton administration economic policymakers were not monitoring financial markets any more than usual even though stock prices took a roller coaster ride last week.</p>
<p>"What we're focused on is doing what we think is right for the long-term economic growth of this country," Rubin said in an interview on CNN's "Evans and Novak" program. "While the markets undoubtedly will fluctuate around ... I think that on balance the economic outlook is very good."</p>
<p>After gaining more than 91 points in the first two days of the week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled sharply in the next two and then gyrated wildly within a 93-point range on Friday. On balance, it lost a net 77 points in the week.</p>
<p>Rubin attributed much of the economy's recent strength to "fiscal discipline," and said the Clinton administration was committed to balancing the federal budget.</p>
<p>He echoed President Bill Clinton's view that any constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget must be flexible enough to accommodate changes in the economy, but added he could not imagine any way of accomplishing that.</p>
<p>"I don't think that you can draft something that will adequately protect you against the dangers of a balanced budget amendment," he said.</p>
<p>"The commitment we have is to a balanced budget," he added. "I do not believe we should put any form of a balanced budget amendment in place."</p>
<p>A balanced budget amendment failed to make it through the Senate last year by one vote. With Republicans having added to their Senate majority in last month's elections, the measure may have enough support to pass Congress.</p>
<p>House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich told "John McLaughlin's One on One" television program a vote on the balanced budget amendment would be "close. But I think at the end of the day we will have enough votes to do it this time."</p>
<p>Rubin held out the possibility that the administration may accept Republican proposals to cut capital gains taxes.</p>
<p>Kasich said he was fairly confident a capital gains tax cut would be agreed, according to excerpts of the program, which airs Sunday.</p>
<p>When the administration begins talks with congressional leaders over how to balance the budget, Republicans will likely put capital gains tax cuts on the bargaining table, while the administration will put its targeted middle class tax cuts and welfare reform adjustments on the table, he said.</p>
<p>"In that full give and take I think we will have a real opportunity to, on our side, try to accomplish the kind of fixes the president wants to in the welfare reform bill," he said.</p>
<p>Rubin took a wait-and-see approach on a recently issued report that concluded the Consumer Price Index was overstating inflation, causing the government to pay out more to retirees and receive less from taxpayers than if a more accurate inflation gauge were used.</p>
<p>"I think the responsible thing to do is not to jump to conclusions, but rather to see what kind of broad-based agreement develops so that you have a technical foundation for any changes that may be advocated or take place, if any are going to take place," he said.</p>
