<headline>Dec S&amp;P 500 futures rally late, close higher.</headline>

<p>December Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index futures rallied in the afternoon to reverse early losses and close sharply higher on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>"I think there's a little sense of panic out there by investors thinking they're missing this thing," said Bob Dickey, a managing director of Dain Bosworth Inc.</p>
<p>December S&amp;P futures touched an all-time high of 734.50 in late trade before rowing back a little to settle at 734.25, up 3.30 points on the day. Earlier in the session, it fell as low as 727.90 after several large dealers sold off at the opening.  </p>
<p>The market was boosted off the lows by apparent institutional buying in mid-afternoon.</p>
<p>One trader on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor noted that open interest had risen significantly every day this week, a sign of major institutional buying.</p>
<p>"Mutual funds were holding back cash on concerns that there would be massive redemptions at the end of October," he said, referring to the large amount of cash that was available.</p>
<p>Open interest in December futures rose 1,884 contacts and that in March climbed 434 on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Most traders expected some follow-through buying in the early part of next week after today's strong close. December S&amp;P futures gained 27.75 points on the week.</p>
<p>But Dickey at Dain Bosworth urged caution.</p>
<p>"We're very close to a top," he said. He saw pivotal support for December S&amp;Ps in the 705 area and possibility of a steep pullback to around 675, noting that a lot of individual stocks were blowing off to new highs and looked overextended.</p>
<p>Dickey said the most vulnerable sector would be the blue chips, particularly the high-tech blue chip stocks, even though they could be good investments in the long term.  </p>
<p>Some traders noted signs that the stock market was decoupling from the bullish bond market.</p>
<p>A brokerage trader said the stock market was unable to catch up with bonds in late morning, when Treasury bonds bounced their off lows. T-bond futures on Chicago Board of Trade ended early today ahead of Monday's Veterans Day holiday.</p>
<p>"I would expect the Fed (Federal Reserve) to maintain their posture and not raise or lower interest rates in the near term, so I think bonds will be relatively stable while stocks have more risk," Dickey said.  </p>
<p>Elsewhere, December S&amp;P Midcap 400 futures closed 1.40 points higher at 250.80 and December Nasdaq 100 futures gained 3.75 to 803.50.</p>
<p>CME's Nikkei 225 futures rose 310.0 to 21,200 after the underlying stock index soared 429.93 to 21,201.04 overnight.</p>
<p>Kansas City Board of Trade's Value Line index futures were up 2.20 to 661.90.</p>
