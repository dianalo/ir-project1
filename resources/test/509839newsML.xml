<p>U S West Communications Group said Tuesday it would ask a U.S. District Court to review portions of orders issued by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission regarding access to its local telephone service market.</p>
<p>At issue are commission decisions on the price and terms under which U S West will give other companies access to its local telephone lines. U S West said AT&amp;T Corp and MCI Communications Co want to provide local service in Minnesota.</p>
<p>U S West said the orders mandate the company provide competitors access to lines for $12.03 per line per month, which it said is substantially below what it costs U S West.</p>
<p>U S West said failed to base pricing decisions on the company's costs.</p>
<p>U S West asserts the commission went beyond the scope of its authority under the federal Telecommunications Act and Minnesota state law.</p>
