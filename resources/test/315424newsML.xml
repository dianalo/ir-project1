<p>Dayton Hudson Corp said Friday it will take a one-time pretax charge against fourth quarter 1996 earnings of $134 million, or $0.35 a share, for the writedown of real estate and store closing costs.</p>
<p>Dayton said it is undertaking a real estate repositioning plan, which includes its Mervyn's division exiting from the Florida and Georgia markets. It also will sell or close about 10 Mervyn's stores in various other markets.  </p>
<p>Dayton said it also plans to renovate its Marshall Field's downtown Milwaukee store.</p>
<p>The charge also includes the effect of the previously announced Marshall Field's dispositions in Texas and the closure of the Marshall Field's Park Forest, Ill., store.</p>
<p>As a result of this series of real estate transactions, Dayton said it expects to generate about $350 million in cash, which will be used to reduce debt and enhance its growth opportunities.</p>
<p>The new impact of these actions at Mervyn's will be to reduce annual revenue by about $375 million, based on 1996 performance.</p>
<p>As previously disclosed, the Marshall Field's dispositions in Texas and the closing of the Marshall Field's Park Forest store will reduce annual revenue by about $130 million. Marshall Field's is part of Dayton's Department Store Division. Mervyn's is a stand-alone division.</p>
<p>In the future, interest savings are expected to substantially offset the impact of these actions on operating profit at both Mervyn's and the Department Store Division.</p>
