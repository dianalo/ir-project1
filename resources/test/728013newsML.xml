<headline>US stock index futures rebound on mid-month buying.</headline>

<p>U.S. stock index futures bounced back in the afternoon on a combination of mid-month portfolio rebalancing and strength in the technology sector, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Late in the session, market participants were preparing for the release of Intel Corp earnings due out after the close.</p>
<p>According to First Call, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based semiconductor maker was expected to report split-adjusted second quarter earnings per share of $0.90, compared with a split-adjusted $0.59 in the year-ago period.  </p>
<p>Shortly after the close, the company reported sharply higher net income of $0.92 per share in the second quarter. It also projected third quarter revenues would be flat to slightly higher than the second quarter's $6.0 billion.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index soared to its ninth consecutive record high as Intel shares advanced before the earnings release.</p>
<p>"The feel-good technology syndrome is continuing," said Jeff Feeney, research analyst for Smith Barney Inc.</p>
<p>He said Texas Instruments' stronger than expected second quarter results this morning set the stage for the rally.  </p>
<p>Texas Instruments Inc reported second quarter net income of $1.26 a share, up from $0.39 in the year ago period.</p>
<p>Earnings so far this season have been generally positive for the market, analysts said, with Merrill Lynch and Citicorp also reporting favorable results today.</p>
<p>Thursday's release of Microsoft earnings will be another key event for the market, Feeney noted.</p>
<p>September S&amp;P 500 futures posted a new record high of 934.00 on the day, surpassing the previous all-time peak of 932.25 set set last week. The contract also registered a new record high settlement of 931.75.  </p>
<p>Mid-month portfolio rebalancing helped propel stock futures upward in the afternoon as investment managers added to their holdings, one S&amp;P floor analyst said. September S&amp;Ps' midsession selloff gave them a buying opportunity, he said.</p>
<p>Futures turned lower around midday on heavy dealer selling, dropping as low as 920.80 before regrouping for the final surge, traders said.</p>
<p>The analyst forecast September S&amp;Ps could see 942.00 to 944.00 in the very near term. "I think a lot of people are figuring the market is on a roll, why stand in the way?" he said.  </p>
<p>This morning's 0.5 percent rise in U.S. June retail sales was largely overshadowed in the market by earnings-related positioning, the traders said.</p>
<p>The U.S. consumer price index for June will be released Wednesday morning. CPI is forecast to rise 0.2 percent, with the core index excluding food and energy also seen up 0.2 percent.</p>
<p>S&amp;P 500 futures ended up 4.90 points at 931.75, Nasdaq 100s rose 14.00 to 1068.25, Russell 2000s were up 2.60 points at 411.05, Nikkei 225 index futures fell 150.0 to 20,175.0 and Midcap 400s rose 1.30 points to 304.80.</p>
