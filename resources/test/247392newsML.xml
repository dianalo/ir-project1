<p>The European Parliament approved on Tuesday a deal reached with the Council after conciliation talks on a four-year action programme to combat drug dependence.</p>
<p>The 27-million-Ecu programme (1996-2000) is designed to raise public awareness about drug abuse and improve cooperation between the European Union member states to tackle it.</p>
<p>When the Parliament gave the proposed action plan  -- COM(94)223 -- a second reading in April, it demanded the reinstatement of a series of amendments to widen its scope.</p>
<p>The Euro-MPs complained that the Council's common position had cut the heart out of the programme by insisting that it concentrate solely on information campaigns, data and research.</p>
<p>Under the compromise reached on October 1, Council accepted the Parliament's argument that drug abuse was a social problem which had to be tackled by prevention, through education and the threat of penalties.</p>
<p>Council agreed the programme should include training for former drug users and street-corner action.</p>
<p>But ministers refused to incorporate therapy for addicts into the programme, saying this went beyond its legal scope.</p>
<p>In a side-swipe at the Netherlands, the joint deal rejects the idea that soft and hard drugs can be treated differently from the point of view of prevention.</p>
<p>It recognises that drug abuse in prisons is a serious problem and can in fact turn non-users into addicts.</p>
