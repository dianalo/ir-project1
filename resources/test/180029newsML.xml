<p>Leaders from Latin America, Spain and Portugal on Monday condemned the U.S. law tightening an economic embargo on Cuba but also said pointedly that democracy must include free and fair elections.</p>
<p>The final declaration of the annual Ibero-American Summit urged the United States to reconsider the Helms-Burton law enacted in March because it "ignores the fundamental principle of respect for the sovereignty of states."</p>
<p>The law named for its Republican sponsors seeks democratic change in Cuba by discouraging investment by other countries. In a thinly veiled reference to communist-ruled Cuba, the one exception in a democratic hemisphere, the 21-nation summit said free elections were necessary for democracy.</p>
<p>"Freedom of expression, association and assembly, full access to information, free, periodic and transparent elections are essential elements of democracy," the 37-page document said. It also cited the "essential role in democratic development" played by political parties and called for "open and transparent debate in public life."</p>
<p>Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina denied speculation that President Fidel Castro -- the only non-elected head of state at the summit other than Spanish King Juan Carlos -- would not sign the statement. "This document is the fruit of all the work we've done and of course Cuba will sign it," Robaina told reporters.</p>
<p>By insisting on elections and free political activity as a condition for democracy, the leaders made clear they did not think Cuba qualified as a democracy, diplomats said.</p>
<p>The Ibero-American summit, the sixth since 1991, moved from Santiago to the seaside city of Vina del Mar on Monday for its third and final day of talks.</p>
<p>Castro, who has worn a conservative blue suit rather than his usual battle fatigues at the summit, livened up the meeting on Sunday with an impassioned speech attacking free market economics, big capital and the U.S. mass media.</p>
<p>But he heard steady calls for reforms to Cuba's one-party political system. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar offered to help Cuba through its economic crisis if there were reforms, while the widow of late Chilean Socialist President Salvador Allende urged Castro to call elections.</p>
<p>"If Cuba decides to move toward economic modernisation, democracy and human rights, Spain will also make a move," Aznar told a news conference, adding that Spain would ask the European Union to aid Cuba in exchange.</p>
<p>In a new diplomatic victory for Castro against the 34-year U.S. embargo, however, the summit lambasted the Helms-Burton measure for violating international law and the U.N. Charter.</p>
<p>The law punishes companies that do business with Cuba by denying executives visas to the United States and allowing law suits by U.S. citizens, including Cuban exiles, who had property confiscated after the 1959 revolution led by Castro.</p>
<p>The measure has been hotly opposed by Canada, Mexico and European governments.</p>
<p>"We urge the government of the United States to reconsider the putting into practice of this law, which strikes a blow against the principles of international co-existence," the final declaration said.</p>
<p>Some kind of condemnation of the Helms-Burton law had been expected, but the document used clearer language than many diplomats had suggested in calling for free elections.</p>
<p>The statement also said that the Ibero-American summit in 1999 will be held in Cuba -- after Venezuela next year and Portugal in 1998.</p>
