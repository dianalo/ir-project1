<p>The U.S. military, struggling to maintain a polished image and a bravo mission after the Cold War, has blundered off the trail and into a bruising battle that it does not want.</p>
<p>The battle of the sexes.</p>
<p>Recent tawdry cases tumbling one on another, from news of marital cheating by officers to rape of women recruits by army drill sergeants, have sparked a media frenzy that is pushing aside for now the debate over budgets and high-tech arms.</p>
<p>The scandal has sparked charges from Congress that the military is still a macho bastion that treats men better than women and coddles randy generals and admirals while hauling lower ranks into court for similar wrongs.</p>
<p>"The public's perception about much of this is wrong. But unless cool heads iron it out in a hurry, the military will suffer," said analyst Douglas Johnston of the private Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.</p>
<p>"The rules about discipline and order in the military have to be equal across all the services and, perhaps more importantly, the public has to understand them. Otherwise it's a losing proposition," added Johnston, a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy who served on nuclear submarines.</p>
<p>Defence Secretary William Cohen denies the problem is epidemic, but he and others at the Pentagon worry that the military has gone too far in its zeal to find rule-breakers, sparking wild charges on telephone hotlines and perhaps making matters worse.</p>
<p>Cohen on Saturday announced he would set up panels to review military training practices, privacy issues and enforcement of laws against adultery.</p>
<p>Analysts and Pentagon officials noted that while U.S. Marine helicopters were rescuing hundreds of foreigners from Sierra Leone last week, newspapers and television were blaring about the sex lives of officers such as Kelly Flinn and Joseph Ralston.</p>
<p>Those separate (and some say unequal) cases involving Air Force Lt. Kelly Flinn, 26, and Air Force Gen. Joseph Ralston, 56, go to the heart of the problem.</p>
<p>Ralston, a potential nominee for chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was widely expected by Pentagon officials to withdraw his name from consideration after meeting with Cohen Monday.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, after backing strict military rules against adultery and sexual harassment for weeks, Cohen has defended his consideration of Ralston to become the nation's top military officer despite Ralston's admission that he had an adulterous affair while separated from his first wife 13 years ago.</p>
<p>But why, ask critics, should Ralston, 56, become chairman of the joint Chiefs of Staff when the Air Force forced Flinn, 26, to resign last month to avoid court-martial on adultery and other charges?</p>
<p>The Pentagon responded that the case against Flinn, the first woman B-52 bomber pilot, involved much more serious charges of fraternisation (having sex with a lower-ranking serviceman), lying and disobeying orders, and that the Ralston case did not involve a threat "to good order and discipline."</p>
<p>But many in Congress, especially women, don't see much of a difference. They suggest that if President Bill Clinton nominates Ralston for the joint chiefs' post, he will have a fight getting the general confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine said the military needs to convince her that it treats men and women or those of different rank equally.</p>
<p>"I think that the military has to make determinations what are the standards with respect to upholding good order and discipline," she said in an interview on the NBC "Today" show.</p>
<p>"The issue here is how we apply these standards and whether or not they're applied uniformly."</p>
<p>Democratic Representative Nita Lowery of New York put it more bluntly at a news conference: "The same good old boys network that has given General Ralston a pat on the back gave Kelly Flinn the back of its hand."</p>
<p>To make matters more complicated, Ralston, who is now vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stripped another lower-ranking general of his command and forced him to resign two years ago for having an adulterous affair.</p>
<p>Cohen, who as a former senator from Maine and knows how these things go, was deciding whether to press Clinton to nominate Ralston or put forward another candidate.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pentagon was busily examining how it might standardise its rules against "fraternization" (social contact between higher and lower ranks) among all services and how to better explain its rules on when adultery is a criminal offence and when it warrants a mild slap on the wrist.</p>
