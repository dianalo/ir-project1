<p>Finland and Ireland, the "nearly men" skirting the core of countries set to usher in a European single currency, are backed by strong economic performances, a Reuter survey of analysts showed on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Both countries will meet the budget deficit-to-gross domestic product (GDP) criterion of three percent or less, and their inflation and interest rates are expected to be well within the ranges stipulated in the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>Analysts said strong economic growth and a low inflation environment put Finland within a whisker of meeting all targets for monetary union.</p>
<p>The median of predictions from 22 economists across Europe showed that the Finnish debt-to-GDP ratio forecast of 61 percent would just miss the 60 percent yardstick.</p>
<p>And while the median prediction from 22 economists forecast Ireland's total debt at 72 percent in 1997, it is falling fast enough to satisfy EMU planners.</p>
<p>"I do not consider it (debt-to-GDP ratio) to be a problem whatsoever," said Brian Venables, senior bond strategist at ABN AMRO in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>"It's not so long ago since it was at 120 percent of GDP so the EU Commission has stated that Ireland's debt-to-GDP ratio does fall within the criterion of approaching 60 percent".</p>
<p>The survey was carried out between February 5 and 10. A separate poll published on Friday showed 93 percent of those taking part thought Ireland would be part of a single currency at its planned 1999 start, while 80 percent backed Finland.</p>
<p>Political will for the project is strong as both countries are set to benefit from lower interest rates if they join monetary union at its inception.</p>
<p>But while the economies are sending out all the right signals, Ireland's proximity to Britain and Finland's ties with neighbouring Sweden have cast a cloud over their chance of entry.</p>
<p>Britain has adopted a "wait-and-see" attitude to EMU ahead of a general election which must be held within three-and-a-half months, while Sweden's government is still undecided.</p>
<p>"The U.K. is Ireland's single largest trading partner," said Dan McLaughlin, chief economist at Riada Stockbrokers in Dublin. "If Ireland is in and the U.K. is out, Ireland is open to big swings in its competitiveness vis a vis the U.K.," he added.</p>
<p>"Sweden is a very important competitor and market area for Finnish firms, but leading politicians think that Finland must make its own decision," said Heiggi Kirves, economist at Merita Bank in Finland.</p>
<p>While economists said Ireland may benefit from holding back to see if Britain's opposition Labour party, hot favourites to win the election, treats Europe more favourably, Finland could well decide to take the plunge alone.</p>
<p>"Our economic history is not so good and we will get more advantage from low and stable interest rates," Kirves said, adding: "EMU will be the strongest part of the European Union so it is better to be in with these countries".</p>
