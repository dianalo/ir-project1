<p>SIMEX Nikkei futures ended weak but off their lows on Monday after opening sharply down following the Dow's second-biggest point drop in history.</p>
<p>Dealers said the Nikkei showed scope for a technical rebound but any rises were likely to be limited in size and duration.</p>
<p>"There was some buying in the last half hour after the follow-through selling from the Dow. But generally sentiment for the Nikkei is still weak," a trader at a U.S. institution said.</p>
<p>The lead Nikkei 225 September contract lost 380 points to end at 19,050 after falling as low as 18,800.  </p>
<p>"We should have a technical rebound to maybe 19,200 tomorrow and then it'll come off again," a senior dealer at a Japanese institution said.</p>
<p>He said the 18,800 level could provide short-term support but the September Nikkei was likely to target a low of 18,500.</p>
<p>The Dow lost 247 points to 7,695 on Friday as the dollar's weakness and concerns about U.S. corporate earnings spurred heavy sales of U.S. stocks.</p>
<p>Taiwan stock index futures were not traded as Taipei markets were closed due to a typhoon.</p>
