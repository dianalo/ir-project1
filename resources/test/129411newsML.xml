<p>Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina travels to the United States next week to speak at the U.N. General Assembly, and officials say she will use the opportunity to project a positive image of Bangladesh to American investors.</p>
<p>"A large part of the prime minister's visit will be dedicated to meeting potential U.S. investors," said one official with the Board of Investment (BOI).</p>
<p>He said Hasina would meet chief executives of big energy firms Unocal Corp, Halliburton, American International Group (AIG) and Exxon during her October 22-28 visit.</p>
<p>Halliburton, whose chief, former U.S. defence secretary Dick Cheney, visited Bangladesh last month, wants to team up with British Cairn Energy Plc for gas exploration in the Bay of Bengal.</p>
<p>Unocal has already signed a memorandum of understading with the Bangladesh government for an integrated project comprising gas, power and cement plants along with Canadian firm Geopetrol International (1993) Ltd.</p>
<p>BOI executive chairman Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury said the prime minister would urge the U.S. firms to invest in Bangladesh's infrastructure, such as power and gas.</p>
<p>Hasina will also meet American bankers and Wall Street fund managers.</p>
<p>Chowdhury said Hasina would explain her government's latest initiatives to attract foreign investors.</p>
<p>He said the government, which took over in June following an election won by Hasina's Awami League party, had taken some major steps to woo private investment.</p>
<p>The BOI chief said the government had set up a law reform commission with the aim of protecting the interests of investors.</p>
<p>"An appropriate and flexible legal framework is of concern to all investors to meet the changing needs of the modern and competitive business world," he told Reuters on Saturday.</p>
<p>"This is an effort to make things more globalised. It will also aim at speedy dispute resolution," he added.</p>
<p>Once the reforms were in place, it would hopefully separate the legislative process from "unwanted interference and foot-dragging by the executive arm of the government", Chowdhury said.</p>
<p>Hasina would also highlight other investment-friendly measures such as the recently enacted law allowing foreigners to have exclusive industrial zones in Bangladesh, he said.</p>
<p>"The law has now allowed build-operate-own export processing zones by the private sector," Chowdhury said, adding that few other countries had similar legislation.</p>
<p>"This a clear indication of the character of the government's economic management," he said.</p>
<p>Chowdhury said Bangladesh was expected to receive up to $300 million from the World Bank, other agencies and donors to create a "private sector infrastructure fund" to encourage investment in the power sector.</p>
<p>Bangladesh last week approved a draft power policy aimed at opening up the sector for private investment.</p>
<p>It also waived value added tax (VAT), which is currently at 15 percent, and import duties on imported materials for setting up projects. Any company investing in power production will also be granted a tax holiday.</p>
