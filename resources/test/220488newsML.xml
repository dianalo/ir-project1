<p>European Parliament President Klaus Haensch recommended on Wednesday specific reforms to the system of Euro-MPs allowances, the butt of stinging criticism from inside and outside the assembly.</p>
<p>In a letter circulated to the parliament's vice-presidents and political group leaders (the Bureau), Haensch said Euro-MPs should be obliged to produce proof of travel to claim expenses and said a statute for Euro-deputies must be drafted early next year.</p>
<p>The Bureau agreed to set up a working party in January to draw up new rules based on Haensch's recommendations.</p>
<p>The move responds to allegations that some Euro-MPs, who are paid by national governments at widely differing rates, have been abusing the system.</p>
<p>"There are problems because some people compensate for having a low salary from travel expenses," a parliament official told Reuters.</p>
<p>"If we had a single statute -- and therefore a common salary scale -- it would get rid of a lot of the problems," he said, adding that Haensch's recommendations had been very well received.</p>
<p>A copy of Haensch's letter, obtained by Reuters, says there should be more control over travel expense claims.</p>
<p>At present Euro-MPs are not obliged to produce proof of travel. This must change, the letter says.</p>
<p>Members of Parliament should also have to produce proof, if asked, that their general expense allowance has been used in accordance with the assembly's rules.</p>
<p>To claim their daily allowance for attending plenary sessions in Strasbourg, they should have to take part in roll-call (named) votes on at least Tuesday to Thursday and sign the register on the other days, Haensch recommends.</p>
<p>The EP President suggested the working party should finish drafting the single statute for Euro-MPs within six months so European Union ministers, who have the final say, can approve it before the next European Parliament elections in 1999.</p>
<p>"There has to be greater transparency about what MEPs receive, what they can receive and what they can't," Haensch told reporters earlier in November, saying this was to protect "the vast majority of collegues who have always behaved absolutely correctly".</p>
<p>Discussions are expected to continue on the Haensch reforms when the new Bureau is elected in January.</p>
