<p>The IMF sees Argentina meeting its fiscal targets in the first half of 1997 but warned it to keep spending under control in an election year, Economy Minister Roque Fernandez said Thursday.</p>
<p>"They were pleased to note that the first quarter looks solid in terms of meeting fiscal targets," Fernandez told reporters after talks with a visiting International Monetary Fund team.</p>
<p>"They also see a quite solid second quarter, although they requested that finances be kept under control in this election year."  </p>
<p>Fernandez said he gave IMF envoys assurances that the government will not overspend in a bid to win the key Congressional election in October, widely considered as a first battle for the presidency in 1999.</p>
<p>The minister also said the Fund and the government agreed Argentina should aim at having a balanced budget in the year 2000. "We believe that we must do more in terms of fiscal reform and eliminate the deficit," he said.</p>
<p>The government, which has beaten its first quarter's shortfall target, expects to post a $3.0 billion fiscal deficit this year.  </p>
<p>Fernandez said the IMF officials shared his concerns over the effects any financial problems in neighboring Brazil could have on Argentina. But he stressed he was not predicting any problems in Brazil, just voicing concern at its likely consequences.</p>
<p>Finance Secretary Pablo Guidotti later said the government is planning to issue a decree raising import duties by half a percentage point. But the full scope of the mesaure was not immediately clear.</p>
