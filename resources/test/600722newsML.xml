<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Finance Minister Dan Meridor again failed to reach an agreement on further cuts to the 1997 budget, the Treasury said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The two met to discuss a Treasury plan to reduce spending by 700-800 million shekels this year on top of the seven billion shekels in reductions contained in the original budget.</p>
<p>A source in the prime minister's office said the two would resume talks next week in the hope of agreeing a package to present to the weekly cabinet meeting on May 30.</p>
<p>The Treasury has not released any details about where it is recommending cuts, which are aimed at preserving the government's deficit target of 2.8 percent of gross domestic target.</p>
<p>Meridor promised to make further budget cuts after the deficit in the first quarter ran ahead of the target. He and Netanyahu have been discussing the cuts since the start of April.</p>
