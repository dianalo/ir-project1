<headline>UK Labour to hold Wirral at general election -poll.</headline>

<p>Voters in the northern England constituency of Wirral South, who turned their backs on the ruling Conservatives in droves last week, will not change their minds at the general election, a poll out on Monday showed.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted by MORI for the Sun newspaper, canvassed nearly 800 voters in the affluent constituency over the weekend. A majority, 54 percent, said they would vote Labour at the general election. Only 38 percent backed the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>The Wirral South by-election, held last Thursday following the death of Conservative MP Barry Porter, saw a 17 percent swing to the opposition Labour Party.</p>
<p>That gave Labour candidate Ben Chapman a majority of 7,888 votes compared with Porter's 8,183 majority. To put that in context, Labour would need only a 4.3 percent swing in the national vote to win the general election, due within 60 days.</p>
<p>MORI had surveyed the same 795 people before the by-election and accurately forecast the scale of Labour's win. If the same swing was translated across the country, Labour would enjoy a landslide victory.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major's government trails by up to 20 percent in national opinion polls. The Wirral obviously offered him few crumbs of comfort.</p>
<p>Not only was the by-election won handsomely by Labour but 73 percent of the voting population turned out to have their say. That makes it difficult for the government to argue that the Conservative vote simply stayed at home.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the prosperous constituency had never before voted in a Labour candidate.</p>
<p>Conservative ministers desperately insisted that this was simply another by-election protest vote and one that would be reversed come the general election.</p>
<p>History is on their side to an extent. During the 1987-1992 Conservative administration, the government did not win one by-election but recaptured all the seats they lost at the general election.</p>
<p>Major said the by-election marked the end of the phoney war. "Next time, a cross in the wrong box could mean Britain takes a wrong turning," he said. But even he had to admit, on ITN television, that if opinion did not change "then we are going to have a Labour government."</p>
<p>Certainly, the Sun/MORI poll suggests they won't recapture Wirral South this time. Of the people who had voted Tory at the 1992 election, 55 percent said that they were variously generally dissatisfied with the government, felt it was time for a change or had no faith in them.</p>
<p>And with the poll suggesting Labour's Chapman will command a 16 percentage point majority at the general election, his buffer of nearly 8,000 votes will hardly be eroded at all.</p>
