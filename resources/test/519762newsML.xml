<p>Stuart Cage of Britain continued his bid for a maiden European Tour victory when he took the second round lead in the Cannes Open at Royal Mougins on Friday.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old Englishman, who missed several weeks of play after catching a stomach bug in South Africa in February, posted a second round four-under-par 67 to move a shot clear of Spain's Santiago Luna and two ahead of compatriot Paul Eales.</p>
<p>Cage is on seven under par. Another Englishman, Paul Broadhurst, is fourth on four under, one ahead of overnight leader Stephen Scahill of New Zealand and Europe's 1996 Rookie of the Year Thomas Bjorn of Denmark.</p>
<p>Cage, joint runner-up spot in the 1995 Irish Open after a playoff, went to the top with three back-nine birdies.</p>
<p>"Things are starting to happen for me again after the illness," said Cage. "The game's been there and I've just been waiting for something to happen. It has and I hope it continues."</p>
<p>While Cage seized the lead, though, it was former Ryder Cup Swede Joakim Haeggman who captured the imagination, storming back from an opening 83 with a 20-shot improvement in an eight-under-par 63.</p>
<p>He came within a stroke of the course record and made the cut by a stroke in the process though he is still four over par.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old Swede, winner of his singles in the 1993 Ryder Cup, would have equalled the 62 set by England's David Carter last year but for a three-putt bogey on the 16th.</p>
<p>Despite nine birdies he was not satisfied. "I could have been 11 under, even set a European record 59," he said. "This round could have been anything.</p>
<p>"I was six under after 10 and actually kicked my bag in frustration at that stage because I knew it could have been at least four better because I had golden chances at the other four holes and horseshoed out of the cup three times.</p>
<p>"I know it's unusual to shoot 63 but it's unusual to shoot 83 as well! I was determined not to let the course beat me," Haeggman added. "I've got a bit of a history of bouncing back. I remember shooting 77 and then 66 one year."</p>
<p>Carter, meanwhile, dropped back in his comeback event after life-saving brain surgery at the Desert Classic seven weeks ago by firing a three-over-par 74. He is on level par.</p>
<p>Earlier, Italian Massimo Florioli became the second European Tour player to be penalised a shot for slow play and the first this year.</p>
<p>He was penalised under rules stiffened this year when he breached pace-of-play rules for the second time at the 16th hole.</p>
