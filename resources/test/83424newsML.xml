<p>U.S. and European Union trade chiefs on Saturday removed a major roadblock to an agreement to scrap tariffs on information technology -- potentially freeing up billions of dollars worth of trade for themselves, Japan and Canada.</p>
<p>The two sides hope to launch the agreement at a high level meeting of World Trade Organisation members later this year.</p>
<p>A deal addressing EU concerns about a U.S.-Japan computer chip arrangement, which was renewed in July, clears the way for negotiations to begin next week on a wider information technology agreement (ITA).</p>
<p>The ITA would eliminate duties on a number of electronic products, including computers, software, computer chips and telecommunications equipment by 2000.</p>
<p>Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and EU Trade Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan resolved their differences on the issue during a two-day meeting of so-called Quadrilateral (Quad) ministers which also included Shunpei Tsukahara of Japan and Arthur Eggleton of Canada.</p>
<p>"This (ITA) is a market access agreement worth tens of billions of dollars to the Quad countries alone," Barshefsky said at a news conference at the conclusion of the meeting.</p>
<p>The deal postpones a January meeting of a U.S.-Japan semiconductor industry group until March to allow time for countries to agree to the wider technology pact. EU trade officials have expressed concern that the U.S.-Japan council would block European access to Japan's computer chip market.</p>
<p>"We are now able to go forward with negotiation of the ITA," Brittan said. "I believe this Quad can be described as the logjam-breaking Quad," he added.</p>
<p>Barshefsky and Brittan also said they decided to try to break another logjam on negotiations for a global deal to open telecommunications markets by improving their offers. The hope is to reach global agreement by February 15.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have said the ITA and the global telecommunications market accord would be two tangible outcomes of the WTO trade ministers meeting in Singapore in December that could demonstrate to average Americans the effectiveness of the global trading body in opening markets.</p>
<p>One U.S. trade official said the ITA agreement would set a precedent for eliminating tariffs in other business sectors.</p>
<p>The trade ministers also agreed to try to resume stalled global negotiations on financial services in early 1997.</p>
