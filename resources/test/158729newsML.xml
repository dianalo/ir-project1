<p>The coupon for China's first seven-year treasury bond whose issue starts on Thursday was set at 8.56 percent, the Liberation Daily said. The issue amount is 20 billion yuan, it said.  </p>
<p>The coupon was worked out by the Finance Ministry on the basis of a public tender for underwriting rights held in Shenzhen on Wednesday in which state-run banks and other major financial institutions including securities houses and brokerages took part, the Liberation Daily said.</p>
<p>Of the total 20 billion yuan worth of bonds to be issued, 14.25 billion was open for bidding by the participants and the rest will be allocated to major underwriters according to the amount they bid for, the Shanghai Securities News said.  </p>
<p>Interest for the new bond will be calculated as from November 1 and will be paid on an annual basis instead of at maturity, the Liberation Daily said.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry said earlier the issue will end on November 20, after which the bond will be listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.</p>
<p>This is the first time that China has issued seven-year T-bonds and Shanghai securities analysts said the period was designed to suit China's economic development cycle.</p>
<p>The coupon is 1.09 percentage points higher than the annual rate of 7.47 percent for one-year bank deposits, the Liberation Daily said.</p>
<p>Analysts believe the bond will be snapped up because of its high returns and China's surging individual bank deposits of more than three trillion yuan at present.</p>
