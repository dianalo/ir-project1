<p>French producers of alcohol ranging from Cognac to Chartreuse won a battle on Tuesday when the government scaled back proposed tax hikes for spirits from 1997.</p>
<p>Social Affairs Minister Jacques Barrot, under fire from spirit producers already reeling from falling demand, agreed to cut proposed tax hikes in the 1997 budget from 17.1 percent to 4.97 percent.</p>
<p>"Strong alcohol will be taxed less than planned," said Bruno Bourg-Broc, head of the cultural and social commission of the National Assembly after hammering out a compromise with Barrot.</p>
<p>But the deal meant bad news for beer producers, who were originally due to escape higher taxes. Bourg-Broc said beers would be taxed nine centimes (0.17 cents) per 1/3 litre bottle.</p>
<p>"Wines will escape taxation," he told reporters.</p>
<p>On Monday, about 200 Cognac producers and local mayors had demonstrated in the southwestern French town of Angouleme against the planned tax rise.</p>
<p>They said that Cognac sales worldwide have fallen 60 percent in the last 15 years and employment in trading houses slid 10 percent in the last decade.</p>
