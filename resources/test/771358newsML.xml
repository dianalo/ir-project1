<p>Jakarta stocks are seen firm on Thursday, with continuing keen interest likely in the cement sector and stability in the currency market, brokers said.</p>
<p>"Cement stocks such as Indocement and Semen Cibinong are likely to continue to attract market attention as each of them has positive news," a broker with a local firm said.</p>
<p>He added that potential upside for Indocement was high after Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Production and Distribution Hartarto said on Wednesday that the government supported a restructuring plan proposed by the firm.  </p>
<p>Brokers said the stable rupiah coupled with sharp rises in the Dow Jones Industrial index overnight are likely to further boost overall market sentiment.</p>
<p>They also expected that trading would be more active today following the debut of medium-sized Bank Arya.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Jakarta Composite Index closed up 5.62 points, or 0.79 percent, at 721.98 points.</p>
<p>Arya rose to a high of 1,200 rupiah, compared with an offer price of 975 rupiah, before easing slightly to 1,175 rupiah in early morning trade.</p>
<p>The bank, which floated 98 million shares,  posted a net profit of 8.83 billion rupiah in 1996, against 4.86 billion rupiah in 1995.</p>
<p>At an initial offer price of 975 rupiah per share, the price earnings ratio was 8.51 times based on expected 1997 net profit of 37.4 billion rupiah in 1997, the bank said.  </p>
<p>Bank Danamon remained under selling pressure due to worries over the bank's expansion strategy in terms of loans and its branch network, brokers said.</p>
<p>Danamon fell 25 rupiah to 1,025 rupiah after touching a year low of 1,000 rupiah, with around two million shares traded.</p>
