<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle markets early Monday were quiet, with no reported bids or sales, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Cattle were priced at $70.00 per cwt, up $1.00 from the majority of last week's sales.</p>
<p>"We've had a few buyers tell us they might bid $67.00 or $68.00, but we don't have anything firm, yet," one Texas Panhandle feedyard manager said of the lack of bids.</p>
<p>Fed cattle prices were seen underpinned this week by active sales the past three weeks, which kept feedlots current.  </p>
<p>This week's showlists were expected steady to smaller than last week following active sales, which resulted in the pulling forward of cattle two to three weeks ahead of scheduled marketings, feedyard sources said.</p>
<p>Lower cattle weights last week were tied to the brisk sales, with average weights the week ended May 10 pegged at 1,156 lbs, compared with an estimated 1,160 the previous week and actual of 1,160 last year, USDA reported on Friday.</p>
<p>But expected strength from the smaller numbers could be tempered if beef demand continues to slow as retailers finish booking orders for Memorial Day and month-end features.</p>
