<p>Crown Prince Felipe of Spain began a four-day visit to France on Monday, making his first official call on a major power.</p>
<p>The son of King Juan Carlos, Felipe de Borbon has made previous official visits as heir to the Spanish throne to Portugal and Latin American countries.</p>
<p>He visited on Monday the Pasteur Institute of medical research and the Louvre Museum. He was due to have talks with Prime Minister Alain Juppe on Tuesday and President Jacques Chirac on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A pilot himself, the prince will visit aircraft-maker Aerospatiale on Thursday.</p>
<p>Neighbours France and Spain enjoy close relations. Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar called on Chirac last May on his first visit to a European Union partner after taking power.</p>
<p>The two leaders agreed to step up collaboration in cracking down on ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) separatist guerrillas who fight in Spain for a separate Basque state and often hide across the border in France.</p>
