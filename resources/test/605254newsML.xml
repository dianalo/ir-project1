<p>Japan's Ministry of Finance (MOF) plans to allow commercial banks to issue straight bonds starting as early as the year from next April 1, a Japanese business daily said on Friday.</p>
<p>The move follows a decision by an advisory panel to the finance minister on Thursday that banks should be allowed to issue straight bonds, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said.</p>
<p>The panel also recommended that bank debentures, which are now issued only by a limited number of financial institutions, including long-term credit banks, should be abolished in the future, the paper said.</p>
<p>Currently, commercial banks are not allowed to issue straight bonds and only the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd is allowed to issue debentures. Commercial banks are nationwide city banks and regional banks.</p>
<p>Neither MOF nor the panel were immediately available for comment.</p>
