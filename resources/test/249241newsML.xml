<p>Israeli envoy Dore Gold arrived in Cairo on Wednesday for talks with Egyptian officials on the Middle East peace process, airport officials said.</p>
<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent Gold to prepare for a visit by Foreign Minister Amr Moussa to Israel and Palestinian self-rule areas but a senior Israeli official who refused to be named has said Gold was trying to stop this visit.</p>
<p>The Israeli envoy's schedule is not yet known.</p>
<p>Israeli officials accuse Egypt of being biased towards the Palestinians and say it has complicated PLO-Israeli negotiations on a long-delayed troop withdrawal from the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>Israel wants to change the terms of the withdrawal to guarantee the security of 400 Jewish settlers living in Hebron among 100,000 Palestinians. The PLO, backed by most Arabs, refuses any changes to the original deal.</p>
