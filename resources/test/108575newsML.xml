<headline>German chemical union demands talks on sick pay.</headline>

<p>German chemical union IG Chemie on Thursday urged employers to enter into immediate talks on controversial plans by German companies, including BASF AG,  to implement cuts in sick payments.</p>
<p>After a meeting of the union's wages committee, IG Chemie wage expert Hans Terbrack said delaying tactics by employers would make the stand-off with workers even worse.</p>
<p>"Employers would be well advised not to let much more time slip by. The annoyance in companies is growing, as the many actions show. We want to negotiate -- and will fight if we have to," Terbrack said in a statement.</p>
<p>The demand comes after 13,000 BASF workers walked off the job on Wednesday after the chemical group said it would cut sick pay to 80 percent of normal wages as of November 1 from 100 percent currently.</p>
<p>BASF announced its plans to implement a new law allowing the cuts just one day after union outrage prompted several car firms to reverse a decision to take the same action.</p>
<p>Terbrack said the German chemical employers' group BAVC had said it would meet with unions two weeks from now and urged its member companies to implement the sick pay cuts.</p>
<p>Terbrack described this move as unhelpful but also indicated a willingness to compromise. He said IG Chemie had already indicated in January that it could envisage a new way of calculating sick payments.</p>
<p>Imagination and creativity were needed to resolve the situation, Terbrack said.</p>
<p>BASF chief executive Juergen Strube, also president of the VCI German Industry Association, said on Thursday the VCI welcomed the new sick pay law and said its implementation would not breach current wage contracts.</p>
