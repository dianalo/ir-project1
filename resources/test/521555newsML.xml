<p>A rally in high technology issues on better-than-forecast Microsoft Corp earnings is expected to lead Wall Street stocks higher at the start of trading on Friday.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials slipped to a modest loss yesterday as a powerful three-day rally in blue chips appeared to have run out of steam, at least for the time being.</p>
<p>"There isn't any economic news out today, but there's good news concerning Microsoft.  It should take techs up again," said Westfalia Investments chief strategist Peter Cardillo.  </p>
<p>"I suspect that we will probably have a positive session for most of the day, with some selling possible later," Cardillo said.  "Earnings reports are positive and there is no economic data.  A stable bond market should give us some support in early trading."</p>
<p>Larry Wachtel, analyst at Prudential Securities, said that high techs will remain a vital part of the market, but that strength will be selective.</p>
<p>"Networkers are in a downward phase and chipmakers are in an upward phase.  The techs got pretty beat up and will probably be helped by Microsoft today," he said.  </p>
<p>In Tokyo, the Nikkei Average climbed 258.73 points, or 1.43 percent, to end at 18,352.14.  Raw material issues such as steel and chemicals backed by firm earnings continued to attract investors.  A rebound in long-strapped financial issues also helped the index.</p>
<p>In London, the FTSE 100 index fell 2.8 to 4296.1.</p>
<p>Microsoft Corp was the standout in London trading of U.S. stocks after the software giant reported better-than-expected earnings following the market close Thursday.  Microsoft was trading at 103-1/4, up from 100 in after-hours trading and up 5-1/8 from its New York close.  </p>
<p>International Business Machines Corp was up 1/2 at 137-5/8, Texas Instruments Inc was up 1/2 at 58-1/4 and Digital Equipment Corp was up 1/2 at 27-3/4.</p>
<p>The dollar pared early losses against the yen in Tokyo and drifted against the mark and yen in Europe.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries were mixed, with the long bond down 5/32 to yield 7.08 percent.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street writes that cellular-phone pioneer Craig McCaw is boosting his stake in Nextel Communications.  The paper asks if investors should start dialing in as well.  </p>
<p>The New York Times Market Place writes that Bankers Trust New York Corp head Fred Newman is guiding a surprising turnaround of the company.</p>
