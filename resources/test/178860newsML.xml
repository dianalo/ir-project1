<p>The world's largest reinsurance company, Munich Reinsurance AG, said Monday it expected to complete its takeover of American Reinsurance Co. by the end of the month.</p>
<p>The German company, known as Munich Re, announced plans in August to take over the third-ranked U.S. reinsurer for $3.3 billion.</p>
<p>"We hope that we can complete the acquisition of American Re this month," Munich Re management board chairman Hans-Juergen Schinzler told a news conference. "The unavoidable official process is running so far without any obstacles."</p>
<p>However, Munich Re will not consolidate American Re until the 1997-1998 business year.</p>
<p>Princeton, N.J.-based American Re will merge with Munich Re's Munich American Reinsurance Co. but retain its name.</p>
<p>Reinsurers spread the risk of insurance companies among other investors.</p>
