<p>Rubber futures slipped by midday on Friday in line with soft Japanese prices and a lack of fresh buying in the local market ahead of the weekend, dealers said.</p>
<p>"It's very quiet and followed the lead of the Japanese market this morning. There were no trades done and the ring sessions were zero again," a local rubber trader said.</p>
<p>Tokyo's benchmark March contract skidded 2.2 yen to reach 132.3 while Kobe's March contract shed 1.3 yen to reach 133.0 in the first afternoon session.</p>
<p>"The market was soft all around. There were some inquiries for RSS3 rubber, but that was it," another trader said.  </p>
<p>At around 0445 GMT, November RSS3 was indicated at 122.00-123.00 U.S. cents a kg from 123.50 cents.</p>
<p>November RSS1 was indicated at 174.50-175.50 Singapore cents (US$1.23-$1.24) a kg from yesterday's settlement of 175.50 cents.</p>
<p>November TSR20 was indicated at 170.50-172.50 Singapore cents (US$1.21-$1.22) a kg against the previous 172.75 cents.</p>
