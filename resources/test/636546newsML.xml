<p>China's National Petroleum Corp notched up a second Venezuelan oil contract on Wednesday and expected to join in more investment in the country in the future, a company official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>CNPC would continue bidding for fields in Venezuela's third round of operating agreements, but Shaoxian declined to say how much more cash would go on the table: "According to the final tender protocol, China's company has the chance to win five areas," she said.</p>
<p>CNPC has spent $358 million just to obtain two 20-year contracts from Venezuela's state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela, and will require much more investments to increase production.</p>
<p>Shaoxian said CNPC now had one operating contract offshore in western Venezuela, one on land in western Venezuela and a feasibility study in Venezuela's bitumen-based boiler fuel orimulsion.</p>
<p>"In the faja maybe we have more opportunity," she said, referring to a possible joint-venture to exploit the vast bitumen deposits in the Orinoco Oil Belt, known as the "faja".</p>
<p>Nelson Vasquez, CNPC's assessor in Venezuela, said he expected to pump 50-60,000 barrels per day (bpd) from Caracoles which was currently producing 5,000-6,000 bpd.</p>
<p>The area contained about 160 million barrels of proven reserves, but it had a "very big exploration potential", Shaoxian said.</p>
<p>CNPC beat Argentina's Perez Companc to the Caracoles contract by only $18 million, while in its bid for the Intercampo field on Tuesday, it offered more than twice its nearest competitor.</p>
