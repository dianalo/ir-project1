<p>Japanese shares plummeted to new depths on Friday, marking a 17-month closing low and capping a week of furious selling which analysts said was showing no signs of abating.</p>
<p>"It is beginning to look like a bottomless pit," one broker said. "Market participants are afraid to step in to buy and are retreating to watch the index fall lower and lower."</p>
<p>The key Nikkei average of 225 leading shares tumbled 770.22 points or 4.26 percent to close at 17,303.65, the lowest close since August 1995.</p>
<p>Its March futures crashed 1,000 points to its maximum single-day point loss possible, finishing at 17,150.</p>
<p>Friday's fall was the largest single-day drop since the Nikkei average posted a loss of 1,054.72 points -- or 5.6 percent -- on January 23, 1995, when investors dumped Japanese shares on fears that the January 17 Kobe earthquake would take a heavy toll on the economy.</p>
<p>Friday's drop took the Nikkei's cumulative losses for the first week of the new year to 2,057.7 points, or a whopping 10.6 percent, sparking hopes that a rebound might ensue. But many brokers said the market environment was still riddled with too much uncertainty.</p>
<p>The dollar tumbled below 116 yen in late Tokyo trade, partly on the perception that the stock freefall may prompt a repatriation of Japanese funds to cover the share losses.</p>
<p>Although weak stocks usually put their home currency under pressure, dealers said Friday's fall was so extreme that it may have caused Japanese investors to start selling off some of their foreign assets to cover their losses in stocks.</p>
<p>Benchmark March Japanese government bond futures rallied on the other hand, as the market drew hope from the stock drop that the current low interest rates will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Analysts said there was no end in sight to the stock meltdown, adding that no bargain-hunters were spotted in the market as the shares tumbled.</p>
<p>"The market's slide doesn't appear to be stopping anytime soon," said Tadahiro Kamogawa, a senior analyst at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>An early afternoon bout of short-covering of bank shares, which led a morning Nikkei drop of over 500 points, temporarily shrank the losses but soon gave way to an avalanche of selling.</p>
<p>"Turnover was quite large today, even without the January option settlements," said Yasuo Ueki, general manager at Nikko Securities. "Today may have been the selling climax."</p>
<p>Traders said the selling frenzy was fed by concerns about the Japanese economy as it faces higher sales taxes from April, and the lack of government plans to help stimulate growth with any new spending programmes as well as implement administrative and financial reforms.</p>
<p>The market ignored various attempts by government leaders on Friday to soothe the pessimism.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said the government is still committed to carrying out planned reform measures. "We are determined to carry out the reforms steadily and without fail," he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Economic Planning Agency Minister Taro Aso, meanwhile, said the market must be allowed to move freely. "It's not for the government to intervene," he told a news conference.</p>
<p>The decline in shares has been led by the banking industry, which is still trying to get out from under a virtual mountain of bad debts left over from the collapse of real estate values in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>The top 20 Japanese banks could see their unrealised stock profits wiped out if the key Nikkei average falls to around the 15,000 level, a report by Goldman Sachs (Japan) said.</p>
