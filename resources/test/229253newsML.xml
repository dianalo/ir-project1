<headline>BTG rises sharply after share split plan.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-12-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Shares in BTG Plc, owner of a number of potentially lucrative patents, rose on Monday after the company said it would seek shareholder approval to split each of its 50p shares into five ordinary shares of 10p each.</p>
<p>At 1015 GMT, the shares -- which have risen sharply in recent months on the back of hopes for its automotive and pharmaceutical products -- were up 37-1/2p at 25.50 stg.</p>
<p>BTG, which announced a return to profitability in the six months to September 30, said it remained cautious on profits for the whole year but said the split would improve marketability of the shares.  </p>
<p>BTG shares have been among the top performing UK stocks in recent months, having leapt from below 300p at the end of September 1995.</p>
