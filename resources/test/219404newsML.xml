<p>Raytheon Co said Frank Kendall, vice president of engineering, has been fired. (Corrects to clarify that Kendall was vice president of engineering, not vice president of the engineering and construction division)</p>
<p>"I can confirm that Frank Kendall...is no longer with the company," said spokesman Robert McWade.</p>
<p>McWade declined to say why Kendall was dismissed.</p>
<p>Kendall joined Raytheon in December 1994 after serving as assistant deputy undersecretary of defense for strategic defensive systems and as director of tactical warfare programs at the Pentagon, McWade said.</p>
<p>McWade also said Elizabeth Allen, senior vice president of corporate communications, has taken a paid leave of absence.</p>
<p>At Raytheon's annual meeting earlier this year, Chief Exeuctive Dennis Picard used Allen as an example of the company's dedication to promoting women. However, in recent months, her responsibilities have changed, leading to speculation she was being pushed aside.</p>
