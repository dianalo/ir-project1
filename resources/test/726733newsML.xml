<p>Sugar prices jumped up on the local market on Monday despite slow consumer buying as the virtual absence of fresh arrivals combined with the shortage of ready stock dragged prices upward, dealers said.</p>
<p>In the ready delivery sugar S-30 rose by 10/15 rupees at 1,465/1,490 rupees per quintal while M-30 moved up by 16/20 rupees at 1,500/1,540 rupees per quintal.</p>
<p>"There is virtual absence of arrivals of sugar from mills to the market due to disruption in transportation following deteriorated law and order situation in city and nearby suburbs," one broker said.</p>
<p>"Law and order has deteriorated following the strike called by the local political parties since last 3/4 days," he said.</p>
<p>Consumer demand remained dull and trading volume was also low due to poor attendance by traders in the market.</p>
<p>Sugar mill delivery remained unquoted as local millers have sold out most of the quantity of free sale quota allotted to them for the first half of current month. The free sale quota for July is 750,000 tonnes, compared to 800,000 tonnes last month.</p>
