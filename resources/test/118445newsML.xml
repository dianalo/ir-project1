<p>A move by the Australian Greens to disallow new export regulations for woodchips failed in the Australian parliament's upper house, the Senate, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Labor opposition and minor Australian Democrats supported the motion by the two Greens senators but the two Independents voted with the conservative Liberal-National coalition government.</p>
<p>For the motion to pass it required the support of all non-government senators.  </p>
<p>Primary Industries Minister John Anderson said the government would maintain the former Labor government's 5.251 million tonne national export quota applying to all woodchips.</p>
<p>But the government said in July that under special export provisions exporters would have access to an additional one million tonnes of woodchips sourced exclusively from sawmill residues in 1996.</p>
<p>It also said additional exports could be sourced on a case-by-case basis from degraded private forests being cleared for hardwood plantations.  </p>
<p>Australian Democrats environment spokeswoman Meg Lees said under the woodchip regulations there was no ceiling on woodchips for export as they allowed unlimited tonnage under degraded forest licences on private land.</p>
<p>The Labor opposition said it was extraordinary that there was no definition of degraded forests and that the Environment Minister Robert Hill would have no influence over the decision to permit clearing of forests on private land.</p>
<p>The system of first and second-stage licences would be abolished with three-year licences available from 1997.  </p>
<p>The government last week used a regulatory power to approve five more export licences for 1996, putting the policy of increased exports into effect.</p>
<p>But regulatory power can be overruled by either house of parliament, which is what the Greens tried and failed to do with Tuesday's motion.</p>
<p>Japan is the main destination of Australia's qwoodchips, used in the manufacture of paper.</p>
