<p>- Yugoslavia's proposal presented on Tuesday to restructure roughly $2.4 billion of debt with commercial bank creditors is no basis for negotiations, said a banking source close to the talks. "It takes two sides to tango. From the banks who were in the meeting it is not a basis for any negotiation," the source said.  </p>
<p>According to a document obtained by Reuters earlier today, Yugoslavia is looking for 80 percent debt forgiveness both on interest and principal.</p>
<p>It proposed to issue $481 million via a syndicated loan with a 25-year maturity and a nine-year grace period.  </p>
<p>The banking source said no date was set for further talks but added the committee could meet in July if full consent was reached by the International Coordination Committee (ICC).</p>
<p>"The banks would always hope to continue discussions and we may meet them in July if the full committee agrees and if there is further economic and financial data," the source said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Yugoslavia's deputy prime minister Danko Djunic said he had extended an invitation to the banks to host further talks in Belgrade in July.  </p>
<p>Commenting on the current proposal by Yugoslavia, the banking source said: "This is an education process and both sides have to understand what works and what does not work."</p>
