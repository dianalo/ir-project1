<headline>Fund buying propels CSCE cocoa to new 8-year high.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-23</dateline>
<text>
<p>CSCE cocoa futures rocketed to new eight-year highs on Monday, as commodity funds bought heavy amid bullish technical indicators and a supportive long-term fundamental outlook, dealers said.</p>
<p>"It penetrated long-term technical resistance areas," said Dean Witter analyst Corey Bell. "I have not seen any new fundamental developments, but the market is underpinned by recent reports of reduced crops next year.</p>
<p>"Also adding fuel to the rally is the idea of a deficit this year and concerns that stocks could be drawn next year," he added. "Everything looks positive."</p>
<p>Benchmark September shot-up to a new life-of-contract high of $1,699 a tonne shortly ahead of the close, before finishing at $1,696, up a hefty $83 -- or about five percent -- on the day.</p>
<p>Spot July soared $97, to close at a fresh contract high of $1,663, the highest nearby level on the continuous weekly charts since 1989. The back months -- which also set lifetime highs -- rose $72 to $80.</p>
<p>Cocoa prices rose at the outset, bolstered by commercial buying in the back months. Upward momentum accelerated after the September contract broke through chart resistance at $1,640, and then its previous contract high of $1,655, triggering a wave of speculative buying, traders said.</p>
<p>"New contract high brought in new spec buying," said one trader. "It's a snowball thing. They are fearful they may miss an opportunity."</p>
<p>A smaller-than-expected increase in net speculative long positions as of June 17 buoyed sentiment, they said.</p>
<p>The CFTC Commitment of Traders report, released late Friday, showed speculators (non-commercials and nonreportables) were net long some 25,000 lots, which was below most traders' expectations of a 30,000-lot speculative net long position.</p>
<p>Weakness in the U.S. dollar against the British pound also gave the New York market a boost today, as arbitrage bought cheaper dollar-denominated CSCE cocoa, traders said.</p>
<p>In the longer term, traders said the fundamental picture continued to underpin the market. Preliminary forecasts from the Ivory Coast pointed to a reduced cocoa harvest in 1997/98, they noted, and talk of harvests being hit by dry weather in late 1997 from the El Nino continued to cause concern.</p>
<p>"Weather is still in the back of everybody's head," noted one trader.</p>
<p>Traders said the upswing was exacerbated by a lack of selling, particularly by producers, who are believed to be generally well hedged.</p>
<p>"There is no one to take any kind of initiative to force this market down," said a trader. "The thinking is that origin don't have the ammunition to knock it down."</p>
<p>Some traders said the market may be ahead of itself in view of the current abundent supply of cocoa and could run into some profit-taking on Tuesday, while other traders expected to see some follow-through buying after the market's strong finish. Based on New York's strong finish, they said London cocoa was due 17 stg higher.</p>
<p>Technically, strong resistance in the September contract was pegged near $1,732, with a long-term chart objective seen at $1,817, traders said.</p>
<p>Volume reached an estimated 14,838 lots.</p>
