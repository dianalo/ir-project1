<p>Russian officials warned Chechen separatist leaders on Sunday that the capture of 22 Russian soldiers could halt Moscow's military withdrawal from the region, news agencies said.</p>
<p>About 65 Chechen fighters seized the Russians on Saturday near the Dagestan-Chechnya border, RIA news agency quoted Anatoly Shirko, commander of the Russian interior ministry forces, as saying.</p>
<p>This latest hostage taking "has seriously complicated the withdrawal of Russian troops" from Chechnya, Shirko said.</p>
<p>Two years after it launched a full-scale military assault on Chechnya to quash the region's moves towards independence, Russia last month agreed to pull out its remaining troops from the region.</p>
<p>Three top Russian officials in the region overseeing Chechen policy sent Chechnya's president a memorandum warning a continuation of the hostage situation could halt the troop withdrawal, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>"These provocations could have irreparable consequences that could lead up to stopping the withdrawal of federal forces and the peace process in Chechnya as a whole," the agency quoted the document as saying.</p>
<p>Chechen leaders, anxious to secure that Russian troops leave the region before a general election scheduled for January 27, have denounced similar incidents in the past and moved to resolve them quickly.</p>
<p>A top Chechen official said he hoped the Russian interior ministry soldiers would be released on Sunday.</p>
<p>"As far as I know, nothing threatens the lives of these policemen, our government officials are there," First Deputy Prime Minister Movladi Udugov told Russian Television.</p>
<p>"I think we'll sort out the situation today and the problem will be solved."</p>
<p>The 22 Russian interior ministry troops were seized after the Chechens arrived at the Chechen-Dagestan border with a group of women and children, Shirko told RIA.</p>
<p>The Chechens "sent the women, old people, and children ahead of them, who mingled with the militiamen and thus prevented them from opening fire," he said.</p>
<p>The Chechens then disarmed the Russians and took them to Chechnya.</p>
<p>Russia sent soldiers into Chechnya in December 1994 to crush a three-year independence bid, but the military, has failed to win firm control of the region and were humiliated in a series of attacks by determined Chechen fighters.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people, most of them civilians, were killed in 21 months of fighting.</p>
