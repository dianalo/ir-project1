<p>Autocam Corp said Friday it expects lower than anticipated results for the third quarter ended March 31 of $0.18 to $0.20 a share.</p>
<p>The company said the results were hurt by start-up costs associated with new fuel system programs.</p>
<p>Autocom, which makes precision-machined parts, did not specify the current estimate for the third quarter.  According to First Call, the current mean estimate of analysts' estimates is $0.29 a share.  </p>
<p>"Although it is common for margins to be lower on new program start-ups, third quarter margins were adversely effected by machine tools which were not only delivered late, but have not performed as expected," Autocam President John Kennedy said.</p>
<p>Kennedy added the company has seen margin improvement within these programs during the quarter and expects margins approaching those of the company's other programs within six months.</p>
