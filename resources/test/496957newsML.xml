<headline>NYC says Europe's bids for taxable debt were worst.</headline>

<p>New York City, which Wednesday morning sold $50 million of floating-rate, taxable debt in Europe, got a dim reception when it later offered that market a chance to buy a bigger amount of fixed-rate debt.</p>
<p>"The two bids from Europe were the worst, the worst from our point of view," said a New York City official, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>The variable rate debt was awarded to Goldman Sachs &amp; Co at the same 28 basis point spread over the London Interbank Offered Rate as similar notes sold by the city in January, even though rates have risen several basis points since then, New York City said, in a prepared release.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of interest in Europe, the city's $120 million taxable offering met with considerable demand in the U.S., as a total of 10 firms bid for the debt, which was awarded to Morgan Stanley at a true interest cost of 7.349221 percent.</p>
<p>The two, separate sales of taxable debt were part of a $900 million sale of tax-exempt bonds sold to U.S. investors, which were priced at a top yield of 6.38 percent in 2027.</p>
<p>The two firms that wanted to sell the debt in Europe were Commerzebank, which bid 7.571182 percent, and Citicorp, which wanted to buy it at 7.643612 percent.</p>
<p>The marked preference Europe's markets have for floating-rate debt was seen as the main reason limiting their interest. "It's a very risk-averse market," said another city official, who also asked not to be named.</p>
<p>Despite the cold shoulder shown by Europe for the city's fixed-rate, taxable debt, city officials said the sale of $50 million drew widespread interest from overseas buyers. "About half of the buyers were new, according to Goldman Sachs," said a city official, referring to the underwriter. "They were pleased by the variety of purchasers, Swiss, German, Japanese," he added.</p>
<p>A Goldman Sachs official was not immediately available to comment.</p>
<p>In prepared remarks, the city comtproller, Alan Hevesi, said the Euronotes were placed with a more diverse group of European investors.</p>
