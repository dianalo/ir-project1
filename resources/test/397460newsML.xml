<p>Ethiopia appealed to 10 Nile basin countries on Monday to work out a framework for a fair distribution of water from the world's longest river.</p>
<p>Failure to divide up Nile water resources fairly could lead to conflict and competition, Ethiopia's Minister of Water Resources Shiferaw Jarso told the opening of a four-day conference on the use of the Nile waters.</p>
<p>"Unless the countries of the Nile coordinate their efforts in the optimum utilisation of their shared water resources... they are bound to enter into competitive and often conflicting uses," Shiferaw said.</p>
<p>The annual conference, first held in 1993 and set to run until 2002, is attended by government representatives from Burundi, Egypt, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire.</p>
<p>Up to 250 million people depend on water from the Nile's four main systems and competition for the water feeds disputes involving Sudan, Egypt and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>In January Sudanese opposition forces of the National Democratic Alliance seized much of Sudan's Blue Nile province in a push towards the Roseires Dam which serves Khartoum.</p>
<p>Sudan accused Ethiopia last year of sponsoring attacks by Sudanese opposition forces as part of a plot to dam the Blue Nile in Ethiopia, thus depriving Egypt and Sudan of water. Ethiopia denied the charge.</p>
<p>Egypt and Sudan agreed in 1959 to divide the right to use the Nile waters between themselves which Shiferaw said was an unfair utilisation of Nile water by the two downstream riparian states at the expense of neighbours upstream.</p>
<p>Shiferaw said Egypt and Sudan have made constant and vigorous claims to the effect that they have acquired rights over the Nile waters and have attempted to bolster such claims by entering into bilateral agreements apportioning the whole flow of the Nile basin between themselves.</p>
<p>"This inequitable state of affairs cannot continue since the upstream Nile riparian countries including Ethiopia will definitely need the Nile waters to meet the various demands of their population," he said.</p>
<p>Ethiopia, which suffers recurrent droughts due to inadequate rainfall, deforestation and soil erosion, must develop its available water resources to attain food security and promote growth, he said.</p>
<p>Ethiopia would exercise its right to utilise its own water supply, "but it has no intention to cause harm to other riparian states."</p>
<p>"In this connection we are prepared and open to sit and engage in fruitful discussions with other riparian states to determine their equitable share of the water of the Nile," Shiferaw said.</p>
<p>"The Nile river provides a unique opportunity for the countries of the region to create a framework for effective cooperation, yet the record shows dismal performance with little or no cooperation among themselves," he added.</p>
<p>Around 27 Ethiopian and international experts as well as delegates are due to present proposals to the conference.</p>
<p>The 4,160-mile (2,600 km) long Nile river drains into the Mediterranean. Its head waters are above Lake Victoria and Lake Albert and the Nile basin area is estimated at three million square kilometres.</p>
