<title>USA: Fish concerns curb U.S. Northwest hydropower.</title>

<p>Some Northwest hydropower dam flows are being curbed amid concerns over whether there will be enough water in April for the annual migration of endangered fish species, industry sources said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"It is sort of political. The fish interests seem to think we need to save a lot of water for April," said a trade source at the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA).</p>
<p>The concerns center around the possibility that cooler-than-normal weather this spring would slow down the runoff, which is still expected to reach near record levels based on snowpack measurements.</p>
<p>As a result, the Grand Coulee reservoir in Washington has been allowed to refill, a situation that will be re-evaluated on Friday.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which operates most federal hydropower projects in the Northwest, said weekly monitoring of the system will begin later this month, but some preliminary measures related to fish management already have been implemented.</p>
<p>BPA said most of the drafting was conducted over the weekend, when flows from the Chief Joseph dam - just downstream of Coulee - dropped as low as 70,000 cubic feet per second (cfs).</p>
<p>Flows from Chief Joseph were 105,000 cfs on Monday and were expected to rise to 115,000 cfs on Tuesday.</p>
<p>BPA said the it has been able to shape flows to meet peak demand needs by implementing most of the cutback during off-peak hours.</p>
<p>Maintenance and upgrade work on several Northwest hydroelectric projects was also cited as limiting generation capacity.</p>
<p>"They are rushing to have fish screens in place before April 1," said another Northwest industry source. The screens are used to direct fish away from turbines toward fish ladders or barges that can safely carry them past the dam.</p>
<p>BPA said turbines equivalant to some 2,000 megawatts, or about 10 percent, of system capacity is currently out of service.</p>
<p>Although maintenance outages are typical at this time of year, the situation has been complicated by this year's heavy snowpack and expected high runoff levels.</p>
<p>Last year, similar high flows and dam spills created problems with dissolved gas levels, which are harmful to fish and more construction work is now underway to limit the problem.</p>
