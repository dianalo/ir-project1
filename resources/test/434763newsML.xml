<p>Pressures that have put hundreds of Japanese gasoline service stations out of business could be easing with lower crude prices and a more stable yen exchange rate, analysts said.</p>
<p>But the sector is expected to continue shrinking amid growing competition, including that from foreign companies.</p>
<p>"Gasoline margins are expected to deteriorate further as retail prices continue to ease," said Jiro Izumi, analyst with Yamaichi Research Institute of Securities and Economics.</p>
<p>"However, positive factors such as lower crude prices and a relatively stable yen against the dollar are emerging, and are likely to put a brake on the fall," Izumi said.</p>
<p>Gasoline was the most profitable product for refiners before oil product imports were deregulated in April 1996, accelerating a decline in retail prices that was already underway.</p>
<p>The gross gasoline margin dropped 40 percent to 33 yen per litre in December 1996, from 55 yen per litre in April 1994, Yamaichi Research Institute said.</p>
<p>The average retail price of gasoline fell to a historic low of 105 yen late last year amid the competition, some 13 percent down since April 1994.  </p>
<p>During the same period the yen fell to a historic low of about 80 to one dollar. It was only late last year that the yen climbed above its 1994 levels. But at the same time crude oil was rising to its highest level since the 1990/1991 Gulf War, largely negating the climb in the yen.</p>
<p>The ever tightening margins on retail gasoline sales -- the difference between retail prices and the yen-based price of crude -- has weighed heavily on oil company results in the past two years.</p>
<p>Yamaichi's Izumi said the narrowing margins would hit oil firms operating profits this year. He forecast the seven leading oil firms would produce 56.6 billion yen in fiscal 1996/97 ending March 31, from the 1993/94 peak of 255.8 billion yen.</p>
<p>The seven firms are Nippon Oil Co Ltd, Showa Shell Sekiyu KK, Mitsubishi Oil Co Ltd, Tonen Corp, Cosmo Oil Co Ltd, General Sekiyu KK and Japan Energy Corp.</p>
<p>Japanese gasoline prices are no longer falling so steeply, but they are low and competition remains fierce in what, by international standards, is an overcrowded market.  </p>
<p>The number of gasoline stations in Japan shrank by 431 to 59,990 in the year to March 1996, marking the first decline in the market in six years.</p>
<p>Yamaichi's Izumi expects the number of outlets to drop sharply to 38,000 by 2005.</p>
<p>On average, Japanese filling station sell 74 kilolitres of gasoline a month, as little as a third of their counter parts in in Europe and the U.S..</p>
<p>"Competition in the retail market is severe," Toshinori Itoh, senior analyst with Daiwa Institute of Research said.</p>
<p>"To cope with the weak retail market, oil firms need to bring forward their cost cutting plans and take more drastic steps to rationalise operations," he said.</p>
<p>The deregulation has already sparked a wave of cooperative pacts in the industry, covering distribution and sharing storage facilities. Showa Shell and Mitsubishi Oil are considering a refining and distribution merger.</p>
<p>In addition, U.S. branded stations are gaining market share. The volume of gasoline sales by Exxon Corp and Mobil Corp stations is well above the national average.</p>
