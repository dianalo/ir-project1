<p>Slovenian shares fell 2.95 percent on Monday extending their losses to a total 6.7 percent since the United States said on Thursday they would not back Slovenia's candidacy to join NATO in 1999.</p>
<p>"Remaining outside of NATO means that international capital will stay away from Slovenia for a longer period than it would otherwise therefore liquidity will remain poor and will thus push prices down," a trader said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the index could fall another 10 percent by the end of August as market liquidity usually dries up during the summer.</p>
<p>* The blue-chip SBI index fell 36.44 points to 1,199.16.</p>
<p>* Petrol trader Petrol was the most actively traded, closing 0.63 percent higher at 16,100 tolars on volume of 913 shares. Traders attributed the rise to a technical rebound after Petrol fell 4.5 percent last week. -- Ljubljana newsroom, 386-61-125-8439</p>
