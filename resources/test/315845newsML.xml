<headline>Spain's Telefonica announces telephone rate cuts.</headline>

<p>Spanish telecoms operator Telefonica told an unscheduled news conference on Friday that it was proposing rate cuts this year for calls internationally and long distance within Spain, local media said.</p>
<p>Telefonica de Espana said it would suggest trimming international rates by 16 percent and domestic long distance rates by 10 percent in two phases, one on February 1 and the other after the summer.  </p>
<p>Telefonica was not immediately available to confirm the reports.</p>
<p>The proposal, which would need government approval, was announced in Barcelona by Telefonica's chairman Juan Villalonga.</p>
<p>Local phone rates and those between cities within a province would remain steady in 1997, but would go up after 1998.</p>
<p>Villalonga said Telefonica would lower international rates by nine percent and interprovincial ones by five percent in the first phase if the government accepted the proposal. The second phase would be implemented in the third or fourth quarter.</p>
<p>He said the rate cuts were being made in conjunction with the full privatisation of the company and would help make it more competitive.</p>
<p>The state plans to sell off its remaining 20.9 percent in the telecoms operator on February 18.</p>
<p>Telefonica last reduced international rates on July 17, trimming an average 13.3 percent off the price of a call overseas. The other rates have been frozen since 1994.</p>
