<p>U.S. cash crude grades moved closer to the end of March dealings on an uneven course, with sweet and sour barrels trading hands at divergent levels.</p>
<p>Traders said the deadline for pipeline scheduling obligations for March has brought the normal amount of choppiness to a relatively modest market.</p>
<p>"The story is the March/April WTI (West Texas Intermediate/Cushing) losing so much ground," said a trader.</p>
<p>The narrowing of the Mar/Apr roll was expected on Monday, but never materialized, according to some dealers. But, the roll has moved down some 25 cents to the even level today.  </p>
<p>Outright cash crude gained sharply on technical short covering and news-related buying. Reports Nigerian oil workers threatened to go on strike this Friday pushed prices, traders said. Considering the Mar/Apr roll, the Mar WTI/Cushing was 30 cts higher from late Monday at $21.20-30 a barrel, against April gains of more than 50 cts.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, the grade session has brought no relief to the suffering sour crude differentials. Traders said Iraqi crude on offer to the U.S. Gulf for middle April met with the same disinterest seen last week for March and early April offerings.</p>
<p>Trades for Mar West Texas Sour/Midland leaned to the weaker side of the two extremes. A pair of deals were confirmed, one at a $2.75 discount to the WTI/Cushing and a second at a $2.57 differential.</p>
<p>Other March deals saw Eugene Island move at a $2.20 discount, withing the wide levels talked late Monday.</p>
<p>Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James was done at a firm 57 cts advantage to the WTI/Cushing, 12 cts higher than mid-range trades yesterday for March business.</p>
<p>Midland/WTI sold at 55 cts under the WTI/Cushing, 5-10 cts lower than Monday.</p>
<p>Postings-Plus deals were talked at very wide marks for March, and around the $2.00-10 levels in the April.</p>
