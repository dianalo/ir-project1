<p>Albania on Sunday approved the quick deployment of an Italian-led multinational security force in the lawless Balkan country while deep divisions emerged in the fragile national unity government set up this month.</p>
<p>Parliament, dominated by President Sali Berisha's rightist Democratic Party, voted 97 to 1 to accept the foreign security force, expected to number about 2,500 troops and police units.</p>
<p>Italy, trying to head off a new wave of illegal Albanian immigrants, wants to deploy the force as soon as possible and diplomats said advance units could arrive this week.</p>
<p>The force will secure the Adriatic ports of Durres and Vlore, where anti-Berisha rebels are in control, and Tirana airport as well as escorting humanitarian relief convoys.</p>
<p>Among the countries expected to join in the operation are Italy, France, Greece, Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Arjan Starova told parliament that the Italian-led force would confine itself to protecting relief operations and would not be involved in trying to reestablish order in the strife-torn country.</p>
<p>"It's a military force which will secure food and medical distribution," he told parliament. "Order must be restored by ourselves."</p>
<p>Albania has been swept by violence since January when a string of popular, but bogus, investment schemes failed and wiped out millions of dollars in savings. Berisha is widely blamed for having let the unregulated schemes flourish.</p>
<p>A popular uprising then swept the country in March, with army depots looted and thousands of automatic weapons seized. Much of southern Albania remains outside of government control.</p>
<p>Starova said the multinational force was essential because it would prevent a food crisis, which would plunge the country further into chaos. It would also allow police to concentrate on reining in the outlaw gangs.</p>
<p>While rebels control main towns and villages in the south, scores of armed gangs have terrorised the countryside, robbing, looting and pillaging. There are daily reports of killing.</p>
<p>Albania's police and army have been in disarray since the March uprising and have been unable to stop the bandit gangs.</p>
<p>Italy and Greece are deeply concerned the Albanian crisis on their borders could trigger another massive wave of illegal immigration, as happened in 1991 and 1992 after the ruthless Stalinist government which ruled for 45 years collapsed.</p>
<p>More than 13,000 Albanians have risked the hazardous trip across the Adriatic since March 13.</p>
<p>Italy and Greece also hope the protection force will help to reassure the 3.4 million population and clear the way for planned early elections in June.</p>
<p>Deployment of the Italian-led force has been marred by a row between Rome and Tirana over the sinking of a refugee boat on Friday. An Italian navy corvette was trying to chase it off.</p>
<p>Starova said 79 people were missing after the Albanian refugee boat collided with the corvette and sank. Four bodies have been found and 34 survivors rescued.</p>
<p>"Sadly they are mostly women and children. This is a national tragedy which must be debated later and we will consider a day of national mourning," Starova told parliament.</p>
<p>Many people on the boat came from Vlore, where part of the Italian-led force will be deployed. Albanian politicians and the public have been outraged by the sinking of the boat.</p>
<p>The multinational force commanders could find themselves facing other problems as well with deep divisions emerging in the all-party crisis government set up earlier this month.</p>
<p>Faced with a popular revolt, Berisha was forced to appoint the all-party government, with opposition socialist Bashkim Fino as prime minister, and to agree to national elections three years ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>But he has been outraged by an agreement last week in Vlore between opposition parties, including Fino's Socialists, and the self-proclaimed committees of national salvation set up in rebel held towns around the country.</p>
<p>Berisha's spokesman Genc Pollo told reporters at parliament that the national unity government set up on March 11 was "in a new situation".</p>
<p>"Each party has certain public responsibilities and must decide either to be on the side of the legitimate government or on the side of the communist rebels that want to overthrow the government by force of arms," he said.</p>
