<p>Italian financial holding group Gemina rose around four percent on the Milan bourse, after gaining over two percent on Wednesday, in volume of over 19 million shares, double yesterday's volume.</p>
<p>Traders said the renewed interest in the group stemmed from expectations of news out of a meeting with analysts due to have taken place on Wednesday but then put off.</p>
<p>"The postponement has made operators think Gemina might be about to make an announcement of some operation, perhaps a sale, as part of its streamlining programme and so are punting on the stock," one trader said.</p>
<p>There was press speculation Gemina might hold a board meeting on Friday but no one at the group was immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>At 1030 GMT, Gemina was quoted 3.45 percent up at 738 lire, off a session high of 745 lire.</p>
