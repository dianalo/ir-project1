<p>Bank of France monetary policy council member Paul Marchelli said on Friday the council's new make-up might allow faster cuts in interest rates but played down talk of a sudden change in policy at the central bank.</p>
<p>"There will be no revolution at the monetary policy council," Marchelli told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>"What we can do, and perhaps the new nominations will allow this, is to accelerate the reduction of official rates."</p>
<p>The French government earlier appointed Pierre Guillen and Jean-Rene Bernard to the nine-member council, replacing Jean Boissonnat and Bruno de Maulde whose mandates expire next week.</p>
<p>The move was seen by economists as potentially tipping the balance in favour of a softer monetary policy than the cautious rate cuts previously adopted by the council under the hawkish guidance of Bank of France governor Jean-Claude Trichet.</p>
<p>Marchelli, who earlier on Friday reiterated his support for rate cuts as long as they were done with care, said the council would be "more balanced" as a result of the nominations.</p>
<p>But that should not encourage outsiders to jump to political conclusions about where monetary policy was heading.</p>
<p>"The men and women appointed to the monetary policy council (CPM) strive to work in the most objective manner, without looking at external pressures," he said.</p>
<p>"The council is not a place for politicking," he said.</p>
<p>Nor was it right to assume the council was divided into separate factions on monetary policy.</p>
<p>"You shouldn't believe that the CPM is split into two camps," he said.</p>
<p>Sources close to the independent central bank have said the two new appointments are likely to create a new balance of power in the council, which until now had a six to three majority in favour of the existing cautious rate policy.</p>
<p>A main feature of that policy has been the practice of keeping French rates slightly above equivalent German rates in order to buttress the stability of the franc against the mark.</p>
<p>Marchelli said that as a personal view he thought France could afford to cut its floor rate below the German repo rate. But he added he was not sure it was right to do so now.</p>
<p>He said last month that the Bank of France might be able to cut interest rates by as much as 50 basis points in the coming months. The Bank's intervention rate was then 3.20 percent.</p>
<p>The Bank of France's key intervention rate, which sets the floor on money market rates, is now at 3.15 percent, compared to the German repo rate of three percent.</p>
<p>But he stressed that individuals on the Bank of France council made their own decisions on monetary policy depending on circumstances.</p>
<p>He also said earlier that it would be unthinkable to see a majority emerge at the Bank of France in favour of weakening the franc.</p>
<p>"Monetary policy is not made according to the will of the president (Chirac), nor the will of the governor (Trichet). It is made by the majority," he said.</p>
<p>He also noted that according to the law which made the Bank independent in 1994, Trichet held the casting vote in the event of a tie. But even Trichet was capable of modifying his position when this appeared appropriate, he said. "He took part in the (recent) reduction in interest rates."</p>
