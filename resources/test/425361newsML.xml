<p>Indonesia will soon start building a $2.2 billion subway linking two business districts in an effort to end crippling traffic congestion in the capital Jakarta, the official Antara news agency reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The agency quoted businessman Aburizal Bakrie, who heads a consortium of Indonesian, Japanese and European companies, as saying on Wednesday the construction of the 14.5-km (nine mile) subway would start in June.</p>
<p>The subway which links Blok M in south Jakarta and the historic Kota area in the north is expected to be completed by August 17, 2001 to coincide with the country's 56th anniversary of independence.</p>
<p>Bustling Jakarta is home to nearly 10 million people and already faces chronic traffic jams, especially in the morning and afternoon peak hours.</p>
<p>Bakrie said the government had given the investors approval to use private loans to fund the project, adding that a number of foreign countries had also agreed to fund the project.</p>
<p>"Informally, they have given their agreement," Bakrie said without elaborating.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Post newspaper reported on Thursday the city administration had initially planned to raise $25 million per year for five years as its equity in the project, and another $35 million a year for 25 years to pay back loans. It gave no further details.</p>
<p>A conglomerate controlled by President Suharto's eldest daughter Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana will also start building a $2.45 billion road-rail link in Jakarta in April.</p>
<p>PT Citra Lamtoro Gung Persada will construct the multi-deck structure which consists of a 23.55 km (14.7 mile) toll road, a 21.25 km (13.2 mile) railway and a public road to link south Jakarta with downtown Kota in the north.</p>
<p>The flyover is due to start operations in 2001.</p>
