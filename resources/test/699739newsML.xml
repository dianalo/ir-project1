<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown will issue a new pocket guide to the UK budget through a Freepost service, in a bid to make it comprehensible to all, he announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I want to be more open with the British people. I want them to understand more about the way in which they are taxed and how the money is spent," Brown said, at a photocall.</p>
<p>"Just as there should be no taxation without representation, there should be no taxation without information."</p>
<p>Copies of the 12-page guide, along with posters advertising the Freepost service, will be despatched to libraries and job centres straight after Wednesday's budget.</p>
<p>Members of the public wanting a copy can simply send their name address to FREEPOST BUDGET 97.</p>
<p>The initial print run is 250,000, with an estimated budget for the guides of 100,000 stg. But the Treasury says it has no way of knowing how high demand is likely to be.</p>
<p>The Treasury will also be putting the whole budget together with the supplementary documents on the Internet. Last year the whole budget was on the Internet within 13 minutes of the end of the speech. The budget is due to begin at 1430 GMT. The website address is http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk .</p>
<p>Brown refused to comment on whether his budget, which will be the first by a Labour government since 1978, would increase taxes but said it would prepare Britain for the long term.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow's will be a budget for the long term. It will equip the country for the future and will meet the people's priorities," he told reporters. The centrepiece of the budget will be a "welfare-to-work" programme to create jobs for 250,000 young people, which will be financed by a "windfall" levy on the profits of privatised utilities.</p>
<p>Many economists also expect him to raise other taxes on the corporate sector and to impose some fiscal tightening on the personal sector to rein in soaring consumer demand.</p>
