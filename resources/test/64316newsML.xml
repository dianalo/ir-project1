<p>Eight of the 12 district banks in the Federal Reserve System have requested a hike in the discount rate amid mounting evidence the pace of economic expansion is likely to remain brisk in the second half of 1996, a senior Fed official said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Eight (Fed) banks have requested a discount rate hike and (of those) three have requested a 50-basis-point (one-half percentage point) discount rate hike," the source told Reuters.</p>
<p>The discount rate, at which the Fed lends funds to member banks, is currently at 5.0 percent. The discount rate serves as a benchmark for loan rates in general and an increase would likely prompt banks to raise the prime rates they charge their best customers, affecting everything from credit card rates to auto loans.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Board discusses discount rate changes every Monday, and its policy-making Federal Open Market Committee meets next Tuesday, on Sept. 24.</p>
<p>That meeting could see the Fed board and the FOMC simultaneously announcing a one-quarter percentage point hike in both the discount rate and the 5.25-percent federal funds rate at which banks lend each other short-term funds, the source said.</p>
<p>"There is a consensus emerging around a 25-basis-point increase in the funds rate," the source said.</p>
<p>The comments roiled the Treasury market, and the inflation-sensitive 30-year bond slid more than half a point, boosting its yield to 7.0 percent from 6.95 percent Monday. Blue-chip stocks also weakened, and the Dow Jones industrial average was off 15 points from Monday's record close at 5,874 in early afternoon trading.</p>
<p>The source said the requests for a discount rate hike have been submitted by banks in Fed districts that are experiencing rapid growth and tight labour markets or that have a "hawkish" anti-inflation tradition.</p>
<p>The three district banks calling for a half-point discount rate hike are in Minneapolis, Richmond, Va., and San Francisco, according to the source.</p>
<p>"There has been a shift, recently, at the Fed," the source said, noting that a widely expected second-half economic slowdown is not materialising as quickly as Fed economists had expected.</p>
<p>The source said the August employment report -- though its strength may have been exaggerated by special factors -- "gave the hawks fresh ammunition and raised questions about how far the (non-inflationary growth threshold) experiment can go."</p>
<p>The jobless rate fell dropped to a seven-year-plus low of 5.1 percent in Auguest.</p>
<p>The source added that some of the Fed governors known for their moderate views on monetary policy -- such as Laurence Meyer -- were sympathetic to the bank presidents' concern that the economy may be overheating.</p>
<p>"We are not going to see another 4.0-percent-plus GDP (Gross Domestic Product growth) in the third quarter, but it's likely to be still above trend," the source said.</p>
<p>The Fed's last interest rate move came on Jan. 31, when the central bank lowered the discount and funds rates by one-quarter percentage point each. Those reductions came amid concern the economic expansion was weakening after anaemic growth in the fourth quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>That easing -- dubbed at the time an insurance policy -- is now regarded at the Fed as "a mistake," the source said.</p>
<p>The source also said the Fed was pleased with the absence of pressure in broad price measures -- but totally committed to holding its ground on the inflation front.</p>
<p>"Every measure of the wage component in labour costs points in the same direction. It's rising," the source said.</p>
<p>The votes favouring a higher discount rate were taken at various regional Fed board meetings in recent weeks. Bank board meetings are held on regular dates, but the schedules differ from bank to bank.</p>
