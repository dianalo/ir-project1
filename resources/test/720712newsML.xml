<p>There will not be much time for Paris share traders to watch the Tour de France cycling race this year.</p>
<p>Two large share placements on Wednesday and two big block trades on the same day disturbed the usual summer lull and showed that big investors are willing to use the current price levels to sell large stakes.</p>
<p>"For sellers this is an excellent time," said the head of syndication at a London-based investment bank.</p>
<p>"The French market and other European markets are near their all-time highs. Buyers are selective but they have a lot of liquidity and are looking for good projects," he said.</p>
<p>"I expect a few more deals before the end of the month. In August it will be quiet again," he added.</p>
<p>JP Morgan and Societe Generale on Wednesday placed a 14 percent stake, or 8.6 million shares, in software engineering group Cap Gemini.</p>
<p>The banks bought the stake at 340 francs per share from holding company Cie Gnrale d'Industrie et de Participations and sold at 344 francs.</p>
<p>In Belgium, Societe Generale de Belgique (SGB) -- owned by Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux -- sold a 24 percent stake in Union Miniere on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The same day, there was a placement of 400,000 shares in media group Havas and 300,000 shares in pay-television group Canal Plus.</p>
<p>On top of that there is a rumour of a placement in electronic engineering and telecoms group Alcatel Alsthom.</p>
<p>"There is a good market for placements at the moment," said the head of syndication at a big French bank. "There is a lot of liquidity around."</p>
<p>The French share market posted an all-time high of 2,986.09 on July 2, boosted by a liquidity bubble, an initial positive reaction to the Socialist-led government and a catch-up with Wall Street and London after the parliamentary election kept prices depressed.</p>
<p>While stock analysts say it is possible the main index could rise to above 3,000, the chances of the market falling have become greater than a further rise.</p>
<p>A sharp 1.51 percent fall on Wall Street on Wednesday was seen by traders as an example of how jitterish investors had become at the current high levels.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons behind the liquidity in the French stock market, estimated by some at up to 100 billion francs.</p>
<p>First there is the traditional buying spree by fund managers after their first-half accounts were closed at June 30. Second, there is an inflow of money out of dividend payments with many French companies having abandoned an option to pay in shares instead of cash.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the French government is set to return some 91 billion francs to investors on July 16 when the so-called Balladur bonds expire. They are special bonds issued by Prime Minister Edouard Balladur in June 1993 to help finance an economic recovery programme.</p>
<p>The Balladur bonds could be used in the past to buy shares in companies that were being privatised and the July payment could have gone to the first tranche of France Telecom if the previous government had remained in power.</p>
<p>The current Socialist-led government, while still weighing its options on some partial privatisations such as France Telecom, is very unlikely to announce a sale this month.</p>
<p>The government has, however, taken a position on another idea from the previous conservative team which could have boosted the share market in the future -- Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn has said he wants to change the pension fund law passed earlier this year which would have allowed the creation of private pension funds investing in shares.</p>
<p>Strauss-Kahn said he wanted to study whether complementary savings schemes could have a place in France without putting the current universal schemes in danger.</p>
