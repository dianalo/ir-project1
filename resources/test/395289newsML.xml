<p>Central European Media Enterprises (CME), the brainchild of American cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder, has been building a media empire on an odd legacy of the communist era -- an abundance of televisions even in countries with few telephones.</p>
<p>"The governments wanted to make sure everyone could hear the message," said Leonard Fertig, chief executive of London-based CME. "And it's no coincidence that there's a lot more televisions than refrigerators and telephones."</p>
<p>For CME all those television sets were part of a strategic equation that added up to building free-to-air, commercial television stations.</p>
<p>CME is not the only company to recognise the potential of the central and eastern European media market. Major media companies such as Luxembourg's CLT and France's Canal Plus are also competing.</p>
<p>But CME, the first to start developing major, commercial television stations in the area, remains the largest player in a market that still has enormous growth potential.</p>
<p>"The game really hasn't started yet," said David Murrell, chief executive of KPMG's international media practice. "This is like UK television before Channel 4. The market won't run out of steam for the next 10 years."</p>
<p>CME has maintained a fierce, single-minded focus on being the first to develop major, commercial television stations in emerging markets.</p>
<p>"We recognise that the first opportunity in these countries is commercially supported, over-the-air television," Fertig told Reuters at CME's London headquarters.</p>
<p>Fertig previously worked in U.S. pay-television operations before linking up with Lauder to run CME.</p>
<p>In many of the post-communist countries cable and satellite television were only available to about 25 percent of the populations -- not enough to attract large advertisers wanting to reach the mass market.</p>
<p>"On a purely commercial basis, if you want to collect advertising revenues the way to do it is to be in everyone's home, not in 25 percent," said Fertig.</p>
<p>The European market was in sharp contrast to many Asian countries. "In India only 30-odd percent of homes have TV," noted Brian Sturgess, a media analyst with ING Barings. "But in Europe the infrastructure is there. Everybody is waiting to be switched on."</p>
<p>Being the first commercial broadcaster in each market is key to CME's success because in most countries only two or three national television frequencies are available.</p>
<p>"They're scarce resources," said Fertig. "So when you win that there isn't much left for the next person."</p>
<p>The strategy has paid off handsomely in revenue growth since CME launched TV Nova in the Czech Republic in February 1994. CME, in conjunction with local partners, now operates national stations in the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Ukraine.</p>
<p>It operates regional stations in Poland, where it is due to launch a national station next October, and is bidding for a national TV licence in Hungary. It also operates regional stations in Germany, its first business, started in 1993.</p>
<p>For the first nine months of 1996, CME's most recently reported period, the company had revenues of $84.2 million.</p>
<p>Profits have yet to follow. TV Nova was CME's only profitable station, although the Slovenian and Romanian stations, both launched in December 1995, were profitable in the 1996 fourth quarter. "But in the first quarter (of 1997) I doubt that's going to be true," Fertig said.</p>
<p>CME was continuing to scout for new markets. Fertig rattled off the Baltics, the Balkans and the former Soviet Union as possibilities.</p>
<p>The company's rapid expansion was the one move media analysts said could lead to problems, but Fertig insisted the company was acting prudently.</p>
<p>"Managing the growth is the hardest thing that we have to do," said Fertig. But CME's practice of working with local partners, and hiring and training employees locally keeps it on track, he said.</p>
<p>Financing was not an issue, he said. The company has raised about $300 million in three separate equities offerings since floating on the Nasdaq market in the United States in late 1994.</p>
<p>Future financing, Fertig said, would include joint ventures, more financing in various public markets and possible deals with international partners.</p>
<p>"CME's business strategy is to become a significant media player in these countries in the post-communist world and then ride the growth of the economies."</p>
