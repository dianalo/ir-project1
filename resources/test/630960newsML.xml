<p>LSI Logic Corp. and Micron Technology, Inc. said Monday they have agreed to jointly develop and manufacture specialised microprocessors for a variety of consumer electronics.</p>
<p>The companies will design a logic chip that includes embedded memory, a design that will replace several chips with a single one, reducing manufacturing costs, they said.</p>
<p>Both companies will have the right to develop customised and standard products based on this technology, and market them to their customers.</p>
<p>"This could be a $3 billion to $5 billion market in three to five years," said Micron Chairman Steve Appleton.</p>
<p>Currently, logic chips that control the basic functions of consumer electronics -- everything from toys to stereos to cameras -- do not have memory. Manufacturers have to buy and install separate memory chips in their products, increasing material costs and manufacturing expense.</p>
<p>Milpitas, Calif.-based LSI, which specialises in making custom logic chips, and Micron, which specialises in memory chips, will combine their expertise to design the new chips. Each company will fund its own research, they said.</p>
<p>Depending on the customer and size of the order, the chips will be made either in LSI's Gresham, Ore., chip factory, or Micron's Boise, Idaho, facility, the companies said.</p>
<p>The chips are expected to be developed by the middle of 1998. The companies will split revenues for each order, they said.</p>
<p>LSI's stock rose 87.5 cents to $42.875 in consolidated afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Micron, based in Boise, Idaho, gained $1.375 to $43.625, also on the NYSE, where it was among the most active issues.</p>
