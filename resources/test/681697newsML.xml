<p>Some rivals may be greeting the scandal at Nomura Securities with secret glee, but others worry that damage to the giant firm will dent the overall credibility of the Japanese market and the brokerage industry.</p>
<p>"Naturally, there is the aspect that other brokerages will temporarily win business that ordinarily would have gone to Nomura," said one Japanese brokerage source.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, the fact that Japan's leading brokerage is involved in such an affair could lead to a decline in confidence in Japan's securities market," the source added.</p>
<p>The high-profile scandal took another twist last week when Tokyo prosecutors served new arrest warrants on former Nomura president Hideo Sakamaki and two other former Nomura executives, alleging that the three conspired in March 1995 to pay 320 million yen ($2.78 million) to Ryuichi Koike, the corporate racketeer at the heart of the affair.</p>
<p>The scandal has already led to more than a dozen arrests including executives from Nomura and one of Japan's biggest banks, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd (DKB), and worries persist that other financial firms will be entangled.</p>
<p>News of the fresh allegations, which came the same day prosecutors charged Sakamaki with violating the Commercial Code by paying Koike 49.73 million yen ($432,000) between January 31 and June 15, 1995, sparked concern that the resolution of the scandal would be delayed as prosecutors continue their probe.</p>
<p>Experts had expected authorities to decide administrative punishment for Nomura, which could include suspension of some business, including dealing on its own account, for up to six months by the end of this month. Now, however, no move is thought likely until at least late July.</p>
<p>Some rival domestic brokerages including second-ranked Daiwa Securities Co Ltd have been actively wooing clients who are shunning Nomura because of the scandal, and some foreign firms have also benefitted a bit, industry sources said.</p>
<p>But some rivals fear the short-term gains of added business could pale in contrast to the blow to the market should industry-leader Nomura be seriously and permanently damaged.</p>
<p>"Nomura has dominated this market and I believe all the others have tried to catch up. We need somebody (to chase). It doesn't have to be Nomura...but Nomura's resources in terms of technology and numbers and quality of manpower are extraordinarily high," another industry source said.</p>
<p>"People talk about the 'Big Four' (Nomura, Daiwa, Nikko Securities Co Ltd and Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd), but it's really one plus three," the source added.</p>
<p>However the saga plays out, many experts say the present pain being felt by Nomura and DKB is a necessary prelude to bringing industry ethics in line with global standards as Japan implements its "Big Bang" reforms, which are aimed at boosting competition in its long-sheltered financial sector.</p>
<p>"The reforms are aimed at creating fair and transparent markets," the first source said. "It may be painful, but what is happening now is a necessary development to move to the new era." ($1=115 yen)</p>
