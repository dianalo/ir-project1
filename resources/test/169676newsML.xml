<p>Iranian state radio said on Wednesday President Bill Clinton's re-election meant the United States would maintain its "interventionist and arrogant" policies.</p>
<p>"The status quo is preserved and, given the relations of power between the (U.S.) legislative and executive bodies, no major change can be foreseen in America's foreign and domestic policies," state-run Tehran radio said in a commentary.</p>
<p>"The cold war between the legislative and executive powers will continue...and Republicans will prove a major stumbling block for the White House by following up accusations of financial and moral corruption against Clinton," it added.</p>
<p>The radio said Clinton might reshuffle his administration and change some policies to improve what it said was Washington's image as a "grim-faced and militaristic" power.</p>
<p>"But replacing some players does not necessarily lead to an essential change in the interventionist and arrogant policies of the White House, unless Washington's political leaders officially announce such changes along with a new strategy," the radio added. It did not say what such a new strategy would be.</p>
<p>Iranian radio earlier reported the results of Tuesday's election, highlighting a low voter turnout.</p>
<p>Iran said last month it had no favourites in the elections, blasting both U.S. parties as hostile to the Islamic republic.</p>
<p>The United States imposed a trade and investment ban on Iran in June 1995, accusing it of sponsoring terrorism and seeking to develop nuclear weapons. Iran denies the charges and says the United States is bent on destroying the Islamic government.</p>
<p>A U.S. law in effect since August tightened the sanctions to include non-U.S. firms.</p>
