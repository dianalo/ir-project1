<p>Italian state-controlled telecoms group STET said on Monday it had agreed a co-operation telecoms deal with Spanish electricity group Endesa and Union Fenosa.</p>
<p>A joint statement added that STET, Endesa and Union Fenosa will also take part in a privatisation bid for Spanish television company Retevision.  </p>
<p>The telecoms accord will set up a long-term partnership between the three companies with the object of becoming the number two telecoms operator in Spain after Telefonica de Espana .</p>
<p>The agreement will set up a partnership owned 50.55 percent by Endesa, 30 percent by STET, and 19.45 percent by Union Fenosa. The Spanish group will contribute their fibre optic network of 10,000 kilometres for immediate use as an alternative telecoms network to Telefonica.</p>
<p>The accord also envisages co-operation outside Spain as both electricity groups and STET have important interests in Latin America and other Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p>The three groups will also take part in the privatisation of Retevision, which operates the transmission of television in Spain, and also holds the second telecommunications licence for Spanish natural coverage.</p>
