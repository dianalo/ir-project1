<title>TURKEY: Iraqi oil flows to Turkey in earnest.</title>

<p>The flow of the first Iraqi oil to world markets for six years began in earnest on Wednesday under the U.N. "oil-for-food" deal.</p>
<p>A Turkish pipeline official said oil began flowing around midday local time (1000 GMT) and he expected around 350,000 barrels per day to be pumped to Turkey's Ceyhan port from the Iraqi oil city of Kirkuk.</p>
<p>Turkish oil officials said the first oil would probably leave Ceyhan at the weekend.</p>
<p>The full flow of oil shipments followed a delay while Iraq apparently awaited the schedule of the first tanker. Iraq said an earlier technical problem that disrupted shipments on Tuesday had been quickly solved.</p>
<p>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Tuesday pushed the button to release the first of $2 billion worth of oil Baghdad is allowed to sell in the next six months. But only a negligible amount had trickled into Turkey until Wednesday.</p>
<p>In Baghdad, an official at Iraq's oil ministry said a technical problem had held up the flow of crude for a short time but Iraqi technicians solved it quickly.</p>
<p>Most revenues from the U.N.-approved scheme are to go toward humanitarian aid for Iraqis suffering under economic sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait.</p>
<p>Iraq's Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed said the flow of Iraqi oil to Turkey was now not facing any political or technical problems.</p>
<p>"Iraq's oil minister denied the existence of any obstructions, whether political or technical, facing the flow of Iraqi oil to the Turkish terminal of Ceyhan," the official Iraqi news agency INA reported.</p>
<p>The minister blamed earlier reports that Iraqi oil shipments were stalled on those "whose aim was to undermine the gains of the Iraqi people."</p>
<p>In Turkey, an official from the state-owned pipeline company Botas said no oil had been pumped earlier on Wednesday because Ceyhan's tanks had enough crude stored for a first tanker.</p>
<p>Turkish refiner Tupras said the United Nations had approved its contract to buy 75,000 bpd from Iraq. A ship was on the way to Ceyhan, it said.</p>
<p>Turkey is planning a ceremony to mark the resumption of oil flow from Ceyhan on December 16. A Turkish oil official has predicted the loading of the first tanker could be on December 12-13.</p>
<p>The Botas official said the first load would come from Ceyhan's 12 storage tanks, each with a capacity of 135,000 cubic metres (850,000 barrels).</p>
<p>The tanks contain both crude from before the U.N. embargo six years ago and new oil pumped during recent testing, stored in around eight tanks, he said.</p>
<p>"There is no difference in the quality between the new and old," he said. "Three or four (of the tanks) have a mixture."</p>
