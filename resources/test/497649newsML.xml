<p>The tough spending plans of the current British Conservative government and the opposition Labour Party will be very difficult to achieve without shrinking the size of the welfare state, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Either the current shape of the welfare state will be maintained and the next government will have to spend -- and tax -- more than planned, or the welfare state will shrink and provide fewer services to fewer people," it said in a report.</p>
<p>The Conservative government has announced it plans to increase spending by just 0.4 percent a year for the next three years and Labour, the main opposition party, has said it will stick to these proposals if it wins the May 1 election.</p>
<p>The IFS said that spending increases this low have never been achieved and the average annual increase in spending over the past 18 years has been 1.9 percent.</p>
<p>A particular area of concern is the health budget.</p>
<p>Both parties have made explicit promises to increase the real level of resources going into the National Health Service each year, but the spending plans for health did not reflect this in any year apart from the current one, the IFS said.</p>
<p>Past history suggests that extra resources will have to be channelled towards health next year and thereafter, but the unusually small reserve contained within the spending plans for future years means there is considerably less flexibility to allow for this without breaching the overall spending limits, the IFS said.</p>
<p>It suggested that funding of public sector pay settlements was another likley pressure point.</p>
<p>"Although the settlements from the pay review bodies, covering 1.3 million public sector workers, should not prove more difficult to fund this year than last, there are signs that average earnings growth is starting to pick up," the IFS said.</p>
<p>"This could put some upward pressure on public pay settlements in the future."</p>
<p>If the ruling Conservative Party is to achieve its aim of cutting public spending as a proportion of GDP, serious choices have to be made about the public sector's role in the finance and provision of these key areas.</p>
<p>The opposition Labour Party has said it will finance its welfare-to-work programme from a windfall levy on privatised utilities' profits, and the cost has been estimated at 3.0 billion stg. Some of this will go on tax rebates to employers rather than additional spending.</p>
<p>It is unclear how Labour's proposals to allow local authorities to use around 7.5 billion stg from the sale of council houses will affect the spending totals, in part because the timing of the phased release of these funds is uncertain. -- Cheryl Juckes + 44 171 542 7715</p>
