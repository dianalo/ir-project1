<p>Hillary Clinton was at the centre of a new controversy on Monday after she suggested she wanted a "formal role" in shaping policy on U.S. welfare reform.</p>
<p>The comments in a Time Magazine interview recalled her policymaking involvement in health care reform -- the biggest disaster of President Bill Clinton's first term in office -- and triggered a flurry of White House damage control.</p>
<p>"I'm not aware that there is any formal role planned for the First Lady other than she will continue a lifetime of work on behalf of the children of America," White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.</p>
<p>"People are stretching here to create something that's not there," he said after the interview caused a stir among the media with President Clinton at the annual meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.</p>
<p>Her comments were vague but, underlining her political lightning-rod status, were read by some as a sign that she was seeking a new power base after her husband's re-election.</p>
<p>"I intend to speak out about welfare reform and write about it ...If there's a formal role that would make sense in terms of reporting to the president...(to) go out, listen to the people. maybe write him some memoranda...I want to travel around and talk to people about what is happening on the ground," she said.</p>
<p>Her past leadership of a policy task force on health care reform was regarded by some as a power grab.</p>
<p>It helped make her an unpopular U.S. first lady, placing her in a pantheon of pilloried presidential spouses that started with Abigail Adams, wife of second U.S. President John Adams, and includes Mary Todd Lincoln and Eleanor Roosevelt (corrects first name from Evelyn).</p>
<p>McCurry said Mrs Clinton already had a formal role as First Lady and was not in line for a policy assignment. The first lady was in Thailand as the tempest erupted, having preceded her husband there from the Philippines to inspect some of Bangkok's efforts to improve the lives of women and children.</p>
<p>"The policy has been made already. The question now is implementing the policy," McCurry said.</p>
<p>A draconian welfare reform measure passed by the Republican Congress and signed into law by Clinton at the height of the U.S. presidential campaign in October ends a 60-year guarantee of federal aid to the poor.</p>
<p>It is expected to deprive at least a million people of public assistance over the next few years. Clinton has said that moving these people into the U.S. workforce, and combatting out-of-wedlock pregnancy and other social problems behind welfare dependency will be one of his toughest second-term challenges.</p>
<p>Mrs Clinton, author of a book on child-rearing called "It Takes A Village", will be "travelling around the country. She'll be in a position to see how welfare reform is being implemented. She'll be in a position to convey that to the president and others in the administration, and that is all consistent with a lifetime of advocacy on behalf of the children of America," McCurry said.</p>
