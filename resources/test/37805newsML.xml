<p>Stock brokers and traders in Indian commercial hub of Bombay were disappointed by the measly incentives announced by the finance minister on Friday.</p>
<p>"If these are the only incentives, the market will take a dive next week," said broker Ramesh Damani, a member of the Bombay Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram told parliament that investments in mutual funds will be exempted from capital gains tax and foreign funds can float dedicated debt funds.</p>
<p>"The pace is slow, terribly slow but the direction is right," said an analyst at a foreign brokerage.</p>
<p>"He's taken some policy decisions which are positive," the analyst said, adding that international investors would be encouraged to invest in India's fledgling debt market.</p>
<p>Chidambaram said the ceiling on bank loans against shares would be doubled to 1.0 million rupees.</p>
<p>He also raised the ceiling on tax spared dividend and interest incomes to 15,000 rupees from 13,000 rupees.</p>
<p>Analysts said the statement had nothing to boost the sluggish stock markets.</p>
<p>"There's nothing to jump start the markets in the short-term," one analyst at a foreign broking firm said.</p>
<p>He said the sops would give domestic mutual funds a "level playing field".</p>
<p>Currently, foreign mutual funds based in Mauritius are exempted from the taxes, one analyst said.</p>
<p>Other traders said the exemption will have no immediate impact on the market because many mutual funds were quoted at huge discounts to their face value.</p>
<p>Chidambaram will make a more detailed statement next week when he will address tax proposals before the finance bill is passed by parliament.</p>
<p>Some analysts are expecting the dilution of a controversial 12.9 percent minimum alternate tax (MAT) on company profits but many brokers feel Chidambaram is unlikely to tamper with the tax proposals announced in July's budget.</p>
