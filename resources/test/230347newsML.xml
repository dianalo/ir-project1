<p>Norstan Inc said on Tuesday that a surge in integration services business paced the rise in revenues and total bookings during the second quarter, contributing to the company's strongest operating profitability in nearly five years.</p>
<p>"We are also very encouraged by the growth of our integration services business -- bookings were up more than 100 percent from a year ago and it is becoming a substantial part of our total revenues," said co-chairman and chief executive officer Paul Baszucki, in an earnings statement.</p>
<p>The company earlier reported record results for its fiscal second quarter to November 2, with net income up 25 pct to $2.7 million, from $2.1 million in the year-ago period. Net income per share rose 17 percent to $0.28 from $0.24 a year earlier.</p>
<p>Total bookings for the first six months rose to a record $185.5 million from $154.7 million in the year-ago period, it said. Growth in integration services stemmed mainly from added bookings from Connect Computer and "continued strength" in cabling and Norstan Integration Services.</p>
<p>Norstan provides integrated voice, video and data technology solutions. It shares rose one to 16-3/4.</p>
