<p>U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on Monday declined to comment on interest rates or currencies in remarks to the Federation of Bankers Associations of Japan.</p>
<p>Greenspan is in Tokyo for meetings with Japanese financial and monetary authorities.  </p>
<p>"The answer to that sort of question I usually do behind closed doors and make certain there are three locks on each door," Greenspan said in response to a question about a possible "triple depreciation" of a drop in U.S. stocks, bonds, and currency.</p>
<p>"I apologise, I'm just really not able to respond to markets, interest rates and all related types of issues because I've been taught by previous central bankers to be terribly cryptic, and when addressing such issues to be utterly incomprehensible."</p>
<p>Greenspan also declined to comment on currencies.</p>
