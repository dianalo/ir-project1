<p>The French government will not impose a new austerity plan to curb the budget deficit to qualify for a single European currency but has taken no final decision on how to tackle this year's expected shortfall, a government spokeswoman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"We have not made any decisions," spokeswoman Catherine Trautmann said after a ministerial meeting to discuss new budget measures ahead of the release of an audit on Monday on the state of public finances.</p>
<p>Trautmann told reporters that decisions would be taken after the submission of the audit, which government sources say is likely to show the deficit running at more than 3.5 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Asked whether the government was considering a new austerity plan to bring down the deficit, Trautmann said, "No, it is out of the question".</p>
<p>France's new Socialist-led government has said it will take action to curb the budget deficit if needed but has ruled out new austerity just to meet a strict interpretation of Maastricht treaty criteria on monetary union.</p>
<p>It is expected to use a mix of tax increases on companies and the rich and savings to bring down the deficit.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday Education Minister Claude Allegre told French radio that the government would impose a one-off charge on profitable businesses to raise cash if needed.</p>
<p>"If necessary, it will be a question of one-off charges on companies which make big profits," Allegre told RMC radio.</p>
<p>"It's normal that those who make big profits in a difficult situation should contribute more than others. But there is no question of raising taxes," he said.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn has said any measures to curb the budget deficit could affect companies and well-off households, and involve budget savings.</p>
<p>He has also said any measures affecting companies would be set up in such a way as to avoid damaging business investment.</p>
<p>The government is expected to try to bring down the budget deficit by a few percentage points, to around 3.3 percent of GDP from around 3.6 percent of GDP, to reach a level acceptable for monetary union.</p>
<p>A reduction of 0.3 percentage points would be the equivalent of roughly 25 billion francs ($4.1 billion) in higher taxes or spending cuts. $ = 6.065 French Francs)</p>
