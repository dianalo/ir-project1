<p>Ecuador's President Fabian Alarcon said Wednesday Energy Minister Raul Baca will remain at his post in the cabinet reshuffle the president has been carrying out since Sunday's referendum.</p>
<p>Asked if Baca would be leaving his post, Alarcon said: "No, Minister Baca is not going."</p>
<p>The president made his remarks at a briefing for foreign correspondents.  </p>
<p>"There will only be two or three changes in the cabinet, recognizing the great job that all ministers have carried out," Alarcon said.</p>
<p>The president refused to give any further details of who will stay or go, preferring to come with one big announcement Monday.</p>
<p>"At the latest, the country will be informed Monday of not only the new cabinet, but of the definitive make-up of the cabinet, in which there will be people who stay and others who go who may occupy other government jobs," he said.  </p>
<p>When asked about a possible change of finance minister, the head of the country's policy-setting monetary board, and the chief of the central bank, Alarcon said he was still pondering the matter.</p>
<p>Fidel Jaramillo, the head of the central bank, offered his resignation Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Alarcon decided to reshuffle his cabinet after a referendum Sunday in which voters endorsed his interim presidency and approved the removal of former President Abdala Bucaram by Congress.  </p>
<p>Several members of the 16-strong cabinet offered their resignations after the vote as a good will gesture to give Alarcon a free hand in choosing ministers after the democratic approval of his administration.</p>
<p>Separately, Alarcon said he is planning to make a visit to the United States in July to meet with investors to attract more funds to the Andean country.</p>
<p>"We are going to intensify our efforts for foreign investment, which is another element which is at the top of our agenda," Alarcon said, adding that the exact date of the visit had not been decided.  </p>
<p>Earlier Wednesday, there was confirmation that so far Alarcon has decided to keep Defense Minister General Ramiro Ricaurte and Foreign Minister Jose Ayala in his cabinet.</p>
<p>According to press reports, the president has also said he would keep Cesar Verduga as government minister and Mario Jaramillo as education minister.</p>
<p>The only cabinet member so far known to be leaving his post is Administration Secretary Arturo Gangotena.</p>
<p>Alarcon was nominated to act as interim president by Congress after Bucaram's ousting in February. He will serve until August 1998, when a new president will take over after general elections.</p>
