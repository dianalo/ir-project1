<p>British insurance broker Willis Corroon Group Plc on Tuesday blamed intense competition and the continuing strength of the pound for a sharp fall in profits over the first six months of the year.</p>
<p>The group declined to comment on recurrent speculation that a tie-up with British rival Sedgwick Group could provide a solution to the problems posed by slim margins and tough competition, but said its plans did not include a large scale merger.</p>
<p>"We believe we will serve our shareholders best by following our own strategy. Certainly smaller deals are fine but we feel the risks of a major one are enormous," said Willis director of corporate communications, Peter Stevens.</p>
<p>Questionmarks still surround Willis' long term strategy and despite its rebuttals, suggestions that it needs to do something dramatic to close the gap with U.S. firms have refused to subside.</p>
<p>In the first half, pre-tax profits slipped to 60.2 million pounds ($98.1 million), broadly in line with analyst forecasts and down from 68.2 million pounds in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Brokerage and fee revenues from continuing operations fell to 335.6 million pounds from 364.2 million pounds.</p>
<p>Shares gave a muted response, shedding one penny to 126-1/2 pence.</p>
<p>Chairman John Reeve said the results were in line with expectations at the start of the year which anticipated both the acute competitive pressures, particularly in the North American and some global speciality businesses, and the unhelpful effects of the strong pound.</p>
<p>The latter wiped 6.6 million pounds off profits though the effects of this should moderate in the second half as comparisons ease.</p>
<p>For the year as a whole the group is expecting currency to reduce profits by around eight million pounds.</p>
<p>Competition, however, remains intense especially in the U.S. and global specialty businesses.</p>
<p>The group hopes over time to make revenue less susceptible to insurance pricing as it increases the provision of a value added advisory services.</p>
<p>In the short term Willis will simply have to grow the businsess and manage the costs as best as it can, admitted Stevens.</p>
<p>Reeve said the group had recently undertaken a number of initiatives to further the development of the business while continuing to implement the change programme instituted to realise the strategy introduced last year.</p>
<p>That included the acquisition of a stake in French broker Gras Savoye and raising its holding in Brazilian broker York Willis Corroon Corretores de Seguros to 100 percent.</p>
<p>Those moves reflected the aim of attaining leadership positions in chosen market sectors, said Reeve.</p>
<p>Stevens said Willis intended to move to a majority holding in Gras Savoye over time but that the most important objective was that it retained its French character and, in all probability, a French shareholding.</p>
<p>The changing balance of Willis' business has progressively reduced the proportion of annual profits in the earlier months of the year, a trend that is expected to continue.</p>
<p>The decision to place subsidiary Sovereign Marine &amp; General Insurance in liquidation last month had a neutral impact on profits but reduced earnings because deferred tax was considered no longer recoverable.</p>
<p>Alongside the results Willis also announced it was establishing a joint IFA (independent financial advisory) business with Abbey National.</p>
<p>The new company, to be called Willis National, will be owned 51 percent by Willis with the remainder held by Abbey National.</p>
<p>Full integration is expected by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Willis said it would provide a broader range of services than either company separately and offer opportunities for more effective use of resources.</p>
