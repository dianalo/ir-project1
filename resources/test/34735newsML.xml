<p>China and Britain are expected to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU) next month that will allow Chinese companies to list on the London Stock Exchange, Ian Lang, president of Britain's Board of Trade, said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Many cash-strapped Chinese companies are keen to apply for listing on overseas markets, but Chinese securities officials say agreement with Britain's LSE has been long delayed by disputes between London and Beijing over Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Lang told a news conference in Beijing that a memorandum of understanding between Britain's Treasury and the China Securities Regulatory Commission was now imminent.</p>
<p>"I anticipate that this will be signed next month," said Lang, who as president of the Board of Trade is a member of the British cabinet. He gave no details.</p>
<p>Relations between Beijing and London have been tested in recent years by disputes over the mid-1997 return of the British colony of Hong Kong to Chinese rule, but both sides say ties have warmed in recent months.</p>
<p>Some 20 Chinese companies are listed in Hong Kong while a handful are traded in New York. China has already signed a similar memorandum of understanding with Singapore.</p>
