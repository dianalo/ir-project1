<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel appealed on Sunday for calm in Germany and other European states after a diplomatic row sparked by a Berlin court verdict that said Iran had ordered assassinations.</p>
<p>In conciliatory remarks he said "a pause for thought" was needed to consider how Germany and the rest of Europe should redefine their battered relations with Tehran.</p>
<p>He also said Bonn was taking seriously threats by a radical Islamic group in Iran to unleash suicide attacks against Germany, but assured Germans that Tehran could be taken at its word that they would come to no harm.</p>
<p>But he said Iran's political leaders would have to give up their support for terrorism and agree to observe international law before a fresh start could be made.</p>
<p>"We must keep calm and realise this important country and the Iranian people do not deserve to have relations cut off completely," he told Hesse Radio in an interview.</p>
<p>"We want to consider carefully how to reshape our relations (with Iran) and that's not something we can achieve overnight," he said.</p>
<p>Kinkel's comments came two days after the leader of the hardline Ansar-e Hizbollah group said his followers were ready to die as martyrs against Germany if ordered by Iran's supreme leader.</p>
<p>Kinkel's remarks were the latest in a series of conciliatory remarks which won the foreign minister praise in the official Tehran Times newspaper on Sunday.</p>
<p>A Berlin court two weeks ago jailed an Iranian and three Lebanese for the murder of four Kurdish dissidents and it accused Tehran of ordering the killings.</p>
<p>The judgement prompted Europe to abandon its "critical dialogue" policy with Iran.</p>
<p>The Berlin verdict not only prompted an official protest from Iran's leadership but also unleashed a wave of protests in Tehran where thousands of people took to the streets. Some tried to storm the German embassy.</p>
<p>The court said Iranian leaders, including the state president and the religious leader, had ordered the killings. But it only mentioned Intelligence Minister Ali Fallahiyan by name. Iran has repeatedly denied all involvement.</p>
<p>Iranian officials have said they are committed to protecting foreign residents and Kinkel issued a ministry statement on Saturday saying he had no reason to doubt Tehran's assurances the 530 Germans in Iran were safe.</p>
<p>"Of course we are taking the latest threats by the extremist Ansar-e Hizbollah to unleash suicide commandos seriously," the statement quoted Kinkel as saying.</p>
<p>"At the same time, no one in Germany has anything to fear since these suicide commandos apparently only act on orders from the (Iranian) government," he said.</p>
<p>Kinkel said he would discuss the future shape of relations with Iran with his EU counterparts at a meeting of foreign ministers on April 29.</p>
<p>The "critical dialogue" policy had been aimed at keeping communications lines with Iran open while trying promote pro-western elements and human rights.</p>
<p>Kinkel's opponents in parliament from the Social Democrats and Greens branded the policy "a complete failure" on Thursday and Greens leader Joschka Fischer called on him to resign.</p>
<p>The verdict was the first time a European court had clearly attributed political responsibility for any of the dozens of assassinations of Iranian opposition figures abroad since the Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979.</p>
