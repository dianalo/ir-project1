<p>More than 200,000 elite Iranian troops on Tuesday launched their largest ever wargames in the Gulf to train for surprise attacks on "enemies" threatening the Islamic republic's security.</p>
<p>The Iranian news agency IRNA said naval, air and land units of the Revolutionary Guards backed by volunteer Basij militia forces launched the three-day manoeuvres code-named "Tariq-ol Qods" (Road to Jerusalem) simultaneously in southern and western Iran.</p>
<p>Revolutionary Guards deputy commander, Brigadier-General Rahim Safavi, said the exercises would include tests of surface-to-air, shore-to-sea and surface-to-surface missiles, the agency said earlier. State media said the wargames were the guard's largest ever.</p>
<p>Safavi said the wargames were defensive in nature and would also include major amphibious exercises in the Strait of Hormuz, conduit for half the world's oil exports.</p>
<p>The troops, elite units chosen in exercises during the past year, will hold the mock battles in four provinces stretching the length of the Gulf and reaching inland to the Iraqi border about 1,400 km (875 miles) away.</p>
<p>Tehran radio said 10 patrol boats equipped with Iranian-built Tondar (Thunder) missile launchers on Tuesday joined the Revolutionary Guards' navy.</p>
<p>It said the vessels, with a top speed of 34 knots, could carry four missiles each, without giving further details.</p>
<p>Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei arrived in the strtegic port of Bandar Abbas to attend the start of the wargames, which Iranian media said were aimed at training surprise attacks on "enemies" threatening the country.</p>
<p>"Although there is no serious and real threat to our borders...we have to be vigilant," Khamenei told thousands of people gathered at the port's Qods (Jerusalem) mosque.</p>
<p>"The moment, God forbid, the people and the youth of this country become careless that is the moment of danger," he said in remarks reported by state-run Tehran radio.</p>
<p>"Our government is based on popular support. Which world power can stand up to the Islamic Republic which is backed by millions of courageous and resistant people across our country?" said Khamenei, also commander-in-chief of Iran's 500,000-strong armed forces.</p>
<p>He said Iran would launch a "harsh response" against anyone threatening its security -- an apparent reference to reports that the United States might strike at the country if a link was established between Tehran and a bombing in June that killed 19 U.S. airmen in Saudi Arabia. Iran denies involvement.</p>
<p>Coinciding with the wargames, Tehran radio said people chanting "Death to America" were marching to a desert region in central Iran to mark a failed U.S. military mission in April 1980 to free 52 Americans held hostage by Islamic militants at the U.S. embassy in Tehran.</p>
<p>Khamenei said the United States and Israel had failed to isolate Iran and pledged that, despite their pressure, Tehran would be steadfast in its demand that "the Zionist regime (Israel) should get the hell out of Palestine", the radio said.</p>
<p>Safavi said Iran would not allow any "alien power to destabilise regional security". He said the departure of "intruding forces" -- a term used to describe U.S. forces in the Gulf -- would help enhance cooperation among regional states.</p>
