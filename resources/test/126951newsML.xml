<p>Italy's troubled information technology group Olivetti on Friday appointed four new board members in a bid to win approval from international investors after the group has lurched from one crisis to another.</p>
<p>The loss-making company also announced an extra member to its current four-strong powerful executive committee to try to deflect criticism that this key decision-making group was still under the influence of former chairman Carlo De Benedetti.</p>
<p>The new directors included Gerard Worms, chairman of the board of general partners of Rothschild Bank, Gordon Owen, chairman of telecoms group Energis, Bruno Lamborghini and a man widely tipped to enter the board, Dario Trevisan.</p>
<p>Olivetti said it had also decided to enlarge its executive committee by appointing Peter Reimpell, a prominent member of the German banking world and a current Olivetti director.</p>
<p>Olivetti has struggled under the strain of continued losses, rapid changes of management and investigations into its accounting practices and desperately needed more credibility in the international investment world with 70 percent of its shareholders outside Italy.</p>
<p>The loss-making company has had three chief executives over the last four months while De Benedetti left last month after he had promised a turnaround into profits in 1996.</p>
<p>The new appointments bring the board numbers up to 17 and Olivetti described Worms and Owen as two distinguished figures in the international financial and industrial community.</p>
<p>Worms is a director of a number of major European companies and banks while Owen was a former chairman of British telecoms group Mercury and group managing director of London-based international telecoms group Cable &amp; Wireless until 1991.</p>
<p>Lamborghini is already deputy chairman of one of Olivetti's five companies -- the fixed line telecoms and media group Telemedia -- while Trevisan is a specialist in international law and a representative of the world of institutional investors, Olivetti said.</p>
<p>"The appointments are consistent with the group's strategic profile in the information technology and telecommunications areas and with its position as a public company," the group said in a statement.</p>
<p>Analysts said the appointments marked a move in the right direction by Olivetti but the group still faced a long struggle simply to survive with heavy debts and many of its businesses either losing money or with profit margins under pressure.</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday, Taiwan computer group Acer denied an Italian newspaper report that it was talking about buying Olivetti's loss-making personal computer company, which is currently up for sale.</p>
