<p>More Rwandan refugees from the camps around Bukavu in eastern Zaire arrived on Monday in Sake, 20kms (12 miles) west of the town of Goma, an official for the U.N. refugee agency said.</p>
<p>"We have about 600 who have arrived so far," said UNHCR spokesman Ray Wilkinson in Goma. "They have come up from the camps around Bukavu, and have had all sorts of deviations en route."</p>
<p>"Our local staff have been told by them that thousands, possibly tens of thousands, of others are behind them. We have to try and gain access to Sake so that a jam does not form around these people," he said.</p>
<p>Some 600,000 refugees have returned home to Rwanda since mid-November, although the flow has been reduced to a trickle in recent days.</p>
<p>World Food Programme spokeswoman Brenda Barton said on Monday that 1,000 tired and hungry people, believed to be Rwandan Hutus, had arrived at the Rwandan town of Gisenyi, over the border from Goma, on Sunday after trekking from Bukavu and Uvira, south of Lake Kivu.</p>
<p>"One woman said she had left about a month ago," Barton said. "She said there were many people behind her."</p>
<p>Wilkinson said the latest refugees to arrive reported fighting south of Sake, and on the road out to the Masisi.</p>
<p>The road into Sake, a small village set on the northern tip of Lake Kivu, is barricaded by Zairean Tutsi rebels, who control Goma and much of North Kivu.</p>
<p>Local people are allowed to pass, but the four red and yellow plastic beer crates that comprise the roadblock have not been moved for foreigners for five days.</p>
<p>Other Rwandan refugees continued to arrive in Mugunga camp outside Goma, fleeing fighting in the Masisi region of eastern Zaire after being displaced by attacks on the three refugee camps of Katale, Kahindo and Kibumba more than a month ago.</p>
<p>"We are getting a lot of very serious wounds," said Nicholas Krzamiem of the International Federation of the Red Cross at a way-station set up at the entrance to Mugunga camp.</p>
<p>"A lot of them are machete wounds, bullets, sticks and stones. These are people being attacked as they are trying to break away from groups of refugees being herded through the forests by former Rwandan Hutu militiamen."</p>
<p>The refugees left Rwanda in 1994 after a Tutsi-led army overran the country following the genocide of Tutsis by the Hutu militia.</p>
