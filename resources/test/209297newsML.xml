<p>COMEX copper ended lower as the market took some profits in quiet trading and corrected itself after the rapid gains of the past week, traders said.</p>
<p>The modest dip of 2,225 tonnes in LME stocks Friday was not enough to provoke another surge in what was already an overbought market. But LME stocks are, nevertheless, at a six-year low of 93,900 tonnes.</p>
<p>John Gross of Copper Journal said although the market was overbought and was correcting itself, low inventories suggest there is still more upside potential.</p>
<p>"With the market running hard and fast, we seem to be getting to the point where emotions could override technical factors with a fair amount of shortcovering coming in," Gross said.</p>
<p>December COMEX settled down 1.30 cents at 104.55 cents a lb, traded 105.70 to 103.85 cents. March delivery, with almost as much open interest as December, went out 0.65 cent lower at 100.80 cents. Volume was estimated at 13,000 lots.</p>
<p>Traders added that few people wanted to take on any major positions, especially ahead of next week when COMEX is closed on Nov 28 and 29 in observance of U.S. Thanksgiving.</p>
