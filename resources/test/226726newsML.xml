<p>ASEAN leaders agreed that Burma, Cambodia and Laos should join the seven-nation Southeast Asian group simultaneously, Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas said on Saturday, but he did not disclose the timing.</p>
<p>"The heads of government reaffirmed their strong commitment to the speedy realisation of an ASEAN comprising all 10 Southeast Asian countries. They agreed that Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar (Burma) be admitted as ASEAN members simultaneously," he said at the end of a one-day ASEAN summit.  </p>
<p>"As to the actual timing of the admission of the three countries, this will be announced in due time," he told a news conference.</p>
<p>ASEAN currently groups Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore and Brunei as full members.</p>
<p>Burma, Laos and Cambodia all have observer status with the organisation.</p>
<p>Laos and Cambodia had been expected to formally join the organisation at the annual meeting of ASEAN foreign ministers being held in July next year in Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>Burma has also applied for membership, but a question mark has hung over the timing following bitter Western criticism of the Rangoon government over its human rights and democracy.</p>
