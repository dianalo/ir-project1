<p>Failed self-regulation of the shipping industry has been the trigger for tighter policing of shipping, according to the head of the U.N. maritime affairs agency.</p>
<p>"Self-regulation is very flaky," William O'Neil, secretary general of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), told Reuters in a recent interview.</p>
<p>He said tough new maritime rules and stricter policing of shipping had in part been brought on by failures of self-regulation, as witnessed by shipping accidents.</p>
<p>But he claimed that despite weaknesses of past practices  the tradition of self-regulation would continue to play a key role in the shipping industry.</p>
<p>The European Union, the U.S. and several Far East nations have introduced stringent checks on ships calling at their ports in recent years, to help clamp down on dangerous and poorly maintained vessels.</p>
<p>However, a series of high profile maritime accidents in recent years have generated political pressure to tighten shipping rules, O'Neil said.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the shipping industry has been governed by international regulation agreed by the 155 nation IMO, rather than national rules.</p>
<p>Enforcement of the rules has been through a web of shipping industry groups such as classification societies, as well as national maritime bodies.</p>
<p>However, causes and consequences of a range of accidents from the Exxon Valdez oil spill to the Herald of Free Enterprise sinking - as well as a range of less high-profile ship losses and marine pollution incidents - have in part been blamed on lax shipping industry practice.</p>
<p>Under O'Neil, the IMO has introduced new rules for oil tanker design, ferry safety and ship management.</p>
<p>Later this year it is set to approve plans demanding bulk carriers are strengthened to help prevent sinking, an issue O'Neil has taken a close interest in.</p>
<p>"Ten years ago, the shipping industry assumed the IMO would disappear. In fact, a large body within shipping did not want the IMO," O'Neil said.</p>
<p>"But within the last eight years there has been a shift in attitudes. People want a strong IMO, because they are afraid of what governments may do on their own. It is a distinct change."</p>
<p>O'Neil said he was confident that implementation next summer of another wide-ranging regulation, the new International Ship Management Code, would proceed smoothly.</p>
