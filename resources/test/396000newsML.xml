<p>Tokyo stocks were little changed in early morning trade on Friday, although major blue-chip issues were pressured by profit taking due to the yen's firming against the dollar overnight, brokers said.</p>
<p>But property-related shares continued to gain ground after the previous day's rally, which limited losses in the key market index, they said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 225 average was up 17.96 points or 0.09 percent at 19,069.67 in the first 15 minutes of trade. The March futures were unchanged at 19,070.</p>
