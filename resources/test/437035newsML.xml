<p>The Single Market Council is expected to adopt on Thursday a common position on a directive which would enable farmers in all EU states to use tractors which can travel at 40 kph, EU officials said.</p>
<p>The European Parliament approved the plan last December.</p>
<p>In June, the European Commission proposed a revision of European type-approval directives approved between 1974 and 1989, so as to increase the maximum permitted speed for tractors from 30 to 40 kph.</p>
<p>The proposal, which has the support of tractor manufacturers, requires the approval of both parliament and ministers to become law.</p>
<p>The proposal is seen as important by most member states so that the majority of tractors currently built and/or marketed in the EU could benefit from the EU type approval system.</p>
<p>Since 1990, manufacturers have been able to obtain EU type approval, which are recognised throughout the EU.</p>
