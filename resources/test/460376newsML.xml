<p>Northern California's Bay Area Rapid Transit District (BART) said on Thursday it would sign an agreement that should clear the way for its $1.2 billion airport extension project.</p>
<p>"We are the final party to sign this 'terms agreement,' which resulted from negotiations that began last month," BART board president Margaret Pryor said.</p>
<p>Pryor said she would sign the agreement because of a commitment made by San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown that could expedite construction.</p>
<p>The agreement -- which sets out how the airline industry, the airport and BART will work together to get the project built -- should clear the way for federal officials to issue a full funding grant agreement for the project, BART said.</p>
<p>"It is our hope that this will break the log-jam and move us rapidly toward construction," Pryor said.</p>
<p>BART is waiting for a full funding grant agreement for $750 million.</p>
<p>The 8.7-mile, $1.167 billion project would extend BART to San Francisco International Airport.</p>
