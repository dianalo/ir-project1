<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin appealed on Monday to Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko urging him to find a compromise in his long-running confrontation with parliament.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's press service released a message the 65-year-old Kremlin leader, who is in hospital preparing for heart surgery, sent to Lukashenko, a hardliner who has been trying to bring his country closer to Russia.</p>
<p>Yeltsin used tanks in October 1993 to crash a bloody rebellion by supporters of the conservative Russian parliament which refused to obey his order to dissolve.</p>
<p>His appeal to Lukashenko said much had to be done to implement an agreement between the two Slav states signed in April on forming a loose union.</p>
<p>"In this connection, the President of the Russian Federation considers it important to find a compromise...between A.G. Lukashenko and the Supreme Soviet of Belarus," said the appeal.</p>
<p>"B.N. Yeltsin urged the president of Belarus to do everything possible to remove differences with parliament."</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency said Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin met Semyon Sharetsky, chairman of the Belarussian parliament who is spearheading its attacks on Lukashenko. They agreed at their meeting in Moscow on close cooperation, Tass said without elaborating.</p>
<p>The stand-off between parliament and Lukashenko intensified when each of them called their own referendum for different dates in November.</p>
<p>Lukashenko, who espouses unabashed nostalgia for the Soviet era, has called a referendum on a new constitution which he says will enable him to rule for 10 more years and appoint one third of the members of a new upper house of parliament.</p>
<p>He wants the vote in the former Soviet republic to take place on November 7, anniversary of the 1917 Bolshevik revolution, along with plebiscites on other issues -- upholding capital punishment, banning private land ownership and changing the national holiday.</p>
<p>Deputies, inspired by leftist agrarians and communists, called a referendum for November 24 on their own constitution -- abolishing the post of president.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Sharetsky accused Lukashenko of dragging the country towards Nazi-style dictatorship.</p>
<p>Lukashenko became Belarus's first post-Soviet president two years ago on a platform of fighting corruption and pressing for a union of some sort with neighbouring Russia.</p>
<p>He has since suspended trade unions, hobbled the country's press and put the brakes on market reforms.</p>
<p>Some influential Russian politicians have expressed their support for Lukashenko, including security supremo Alexander Lebed and powerful Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov.</p>
