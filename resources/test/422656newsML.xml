<p>Schering-Plough Corp launched its anti-cancer drug Caelyx in Europe on Wednesday and said the new technology using tiny balls of fat to help the drug home in on tumours could transform cancer therapy. Caelyx, already marketed as Doxil in the United States, uses specially reinforced liposomes to encase the standard anti-cancer drug doxorubicin.</p>
<p>The liposomes help keep the drug from being absorbed by the body before it can get to the targeted tumour, and help release the doxorubicin more slowly over time.</p>
<p>"You can deliver more of the drug to the tumour," said Dr Martin Gore, an oncologist at London's Royal Marsden Hospital.</p>
<p>"This is really quite an exciting way forward."</p>
<p>Other attempts have been made at using liposomes to deliver drugs, but they have not worked very well, said Dr Simon Stewart, an oncologist at London's Hammersmith and St Mary's hospitals.</p>
<p>"The problem is they become leaky, and the drug doesn't stay in the circulation very long," he told a news briefing.</p>
<p>Caelyx, developed by SEQUUS Pharmaceuticals Menlo Park, California uses what the company calls "Stealth Liposomes," coated with an inert polymer that attracts water and makes the liposome more stable.</p>
<p>Studies have shown it helps keep the doxorubicin in the body for up to three weeks after an injection. Stewart said this had the effect of making an injection as effective as a constant infusion of the drug.</p>
<p>The researchers do not know exactly how, but the liposomes hold onto the drug until it is inside the tumour, when it leaks out through the tumour's porous blood vessels.</p>
<p>Caelyx is currently licensed for use against Kaposi's sarcoma, a once-rare form of cancer that has become one of the marker diseases for AIDS. In the United States Doxil is licensed only for use when other cancer chemotherapies have failed.</p>
<p>In a study published in last month's Journal of Clinical Oncology, SEQUUS found 20 out of 53 Kaposi's sarcoma patients responded to the drug.</p>
<p>A larger trial of 241 patients showed more than 58 percent had partial or complete remission, compared to 23 percent of those on the standard bleomycin and vincristine regime.</p>
<p>Tests using a radioactive chemical to mark the drug showed it seemed to accumulate in the targeted tumours.</p>
<p>Schering says it has fewer of the side-effects associated with chemotherapy such as nausea and weight loss, although it does seem to damage the bone marrow and thus the body's immune system. It does not, however, show the toxic effects on the heart that high doses of standardly delivered doxorubicin can.</p>
<p>Schering and SEQUUS are now testing the drug on ovarian, breast, and head and neck cancer.</p>
