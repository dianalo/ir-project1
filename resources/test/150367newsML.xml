<p>PALM OIL FUTURES - Prices ended higher, helped by short-covering from refiners. Next resistance seen at 1170-1180 ringgit. Market firm and awaiting full export data for October.</p>
<p>PALM OIL PHYSICAL - Prices also firmed but trading still generally thin and focussed on crude palm oil.  </p>
<p>Malaysian palm oil prices ended higher after covering by refiners and confidence that the market will surge until the release of full export data for October on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>But a correction was likely soon after, as the market had little fundamentals to trade on, they said.</p>
<p>"The market's picking up and it's firm. It's probably riding on the steam of export figures which will be out end of the month," said a trader.</p>
<p>Another dealer said third position January futures could climb another 30 to 40 ringgit by Friday.  </p>
<p>"I think the next resistance is between 1,170 and 1,180," said the dealer. "But there's not enough incentive to support the price at this level."</p>
<p>Traders said Tuesday's buying was believed to be mostly covering by refiners, which led to higher prices in both the physical and futures market.</p>
<p>"I think prices will fall back once the refiners' covering is over," said another trader. He said market players were still concerned over the near-term fundamental outlook.</p>
<p>Demand is likely to slow down over the next two months which could lead to a further build-up in domestic stocks.  </p>
<p>Traders said players were awaiting the release of October export data from cargo surveyors Societe Generale de Surveillance (SGS) and Caleb Brett later in the week.</p>
<p>SGS on Monday estimated Malaysia's palm oil exports for October 1-25 at 615,327 tonnes compared with 528,150 tonnes for September 1-25.</p>
<p>Palm oil stocks at the end of September stood at 894,030 tonnes, the Palm Oil Registration and Licensing Authority figures showed.  </p>
<p>January crude palm oil futures closed at 1,147 ringgit ($456.61) a tonne, up 19 ringgit.</p>
<p>Turnover on the futures market was 1,401 lots against 1,047 on Monday.</p>
<p>Physical Nov (south) crude palm oil was offered at 1,175 ringgit ($467.75) a tonne, up 15 ringgit from Monday, with bids at 1,160.</p>
<p>Nov (central) was offered at 1,155 with bids at 1,145, and Nov (north) saw offers at 1,145 and bids at 1,135.</p>
<p>Dec (south) was offered at 1,175 ringgit with bids at 1,170. Dec (central) saw offers at 1,160 and bids at 1,150.  </p>
<p>Among refined products, Nov RBD palm olein was offered at $535 a tonne FOB Malaysia, and Dec to Mar at $532.50.</p>
<p>Nov to Mar RBD palm oil were offered at $500.</p>
