<p>Base metal markets were more lively during Thursday afternoon's LME trading, as copper cleared important technical resistance en route to closing at the highs. Traders said overall LME sentiment is favouring the upside, and all markets were expected to benefit to varying degrees on the upside in the short term.</p>
<p>In Chicago, the Commodities Research Bureau index was 0.50 points lower at 241.66.</p>
<p>METALS</p>
<p>Aluminium was firm, and closed conclusively above $1,600 after setting a new seven-month high, while there were gains also in most other markets. Aluminium broke above $1,600 today, and eventually edged up to the top of the $1,600/1,610 resistance band, which put the market on course to swing up to $1,650.</p>
<p>Even copper, where long-term fundamentals are not promising, was being supported by current inventory tightness and has further upside potential, they said. The market eventually cleared previously stubborn resistance around $2,250 during a more active afternoon session, running up to conclude the kerb at $2,270, a gain of $30 a tonne. Traders expected a challenge of $2,280 resistance now heralding an attack on the more important level of $2,313 -- the recent high.</p>
<p>Nickel prices shook off earlier uncertainty during the afternoon session, and resumed the strong uptrend seen so far this year by moving smartly higher. Traders said buy-stops helped prices reach above $7,200 at one stage, although there was some resistance here ahead of the stronger hurdle pegged at $7,450. Despite this last business was at $7,210, up $105 from yesterday, and well above the $7,040 low seen earlier.</p>
<p>Lead gained also during the afternoon session, largely helped by copper's renewed strength, although traders also cited current severe weather in Europe. It was anticipated this would lead to increased replacement vehicle battery demand if it persisted. Last kerb trade was at $692, up $6.</p>
<p>Tin similarly climbed during the afternoon after a largely lacklustre morning spent at little changed levels. Final business was at $5,855, a $35 advance from yesterday.</p>
<p>However, zinc remained inhibited within a tight band, and prices finished the day at $1,063, down $2 after a session of little movement and light interest.</p>

<p>GOLD</p>
<p>New York precious metals futures were slightly higher at midday Thursday, recovering from a fresh fall to three-year lows overnight. "I think the slightly-higher-than expected US December PPI data helped prompt a little short covering, as did concern about the health of Russian President Yeltsin," Refco New York analyst Tim Porter said. COMEX February gold was up $0.50 at $357.30 an ounce, after rising to a morning high at $359.10 on good morning volume estimated at 20,000 lots for the gold strip. In the bullion market, spot gold was quoted $355.80/356.30 midday, compared to the London Thursday afternoon fix at $356.50, after gold saw a fresh three year low at the morning fix at $354.50.</p>
<p>GRAINS</p>
<p>CBOT wheat futures were lower at midsession on bearish input from the export sector and on snow in the U.S. Midwest which will help protect the U.S. winter wheat crop, traders said. At 1050 CST, wheat was four to five cents per bushel lower, with March down 4-1/2 at $3.90-1/2.</p>
<p>OIL</p>
<p>NYMEX crude turned lower Thursday afternoon when it failed to break key technical resistance of $26.80, crude's post-Gulf War high, while losses in gasoline weighed on the oil complex generally. "Crude hit good resistance at $26.80 and went back," said Warren Tashnek, president of Fimat USA Futures in Houston. At 1459 EST, February crude was off 16 cents at $26.46 a barrel while February gasoline was off 1.04 cents a gallon at 71.15 cents.</p>
<p>SUGAR</p>
<p>CSCE world sugar prices broke sharply lower at midday amid heavy fund selling, sinking through support at 10.70 cents a lb, traders said. The day's second wave of fund selling touched off major sell stops in the low 10.70s in nearby March, overriding the light trade buying that had supported the market early on. At 1202 EST, March delivery was down 0.24 cent at 10.63 cents, just above its low of 10.61. Scattered trade buying appeared to have slowed the downtrend.</p>
