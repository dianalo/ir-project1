<p>Zairean villagers said on Wednesday Tutsi-dominated rebels slaughtered many Rwandan Hutu refugees at camps sealed off from aid workers and journalists for three days.</p>
<p>The villagers, travelling towards Kisangani, said a pitched battle between rebels and refugees accompanied the slaughter on Tuesday at camps near Kasese village, 25 km (15 miles) south of the city.</p>
<p>"The (rebel) army went to the camp at 8 a.m. yesterday. They killed many, many refugees -- hundreds. There was lots of shooting all morning," Alphonse Soku, a farmer, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"They used a mechanical digger to bury the bodies."</p>
<p>Two Zairean women standing nearby agreed with Soku's account. All three appeared frightened and reluctant to talk.</p>
<p>The camps at Kasese for 55,000 Rwandan refugees have been sealed off from aid workers and journalists for three days.</p>
<p>But rebel leader Laurent Kabila told Reuters by telephone from Zaire's second largest city Lubumbashi that the reports were "total nonsense". He said Rwandan Hutu militiamen had attacked villagers and rebels only intervened to stop the fighting.</p>
<p>"There is no truth whatsoever in these reports. The truth is that local Zaireans were attacked by the Rwandan Hutu militia and our army only stepped in to stop the fighting," he said.</p>
<p>He blamed chaos in the camps on the United Nations for failing to address the issue of the Rwandan Hutu refugees.</p>
<p>The U.N. refugee agency said it was checking reports many people had been killed and the Kasese refugees had fled after a rebel military operation on Tuesday and attacks by villagers.</p>
<p>"This is horrifying because we have our hands tied as far as being able to help these people but now we hear they are being killed," said Brenda Barton, spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Programme. She said she had one report 500 people were killed.</p>
<p>Paul Stromberg, UNHCR spokesman in Kisangani, said rebels denied permission on security grounds for a flight over Kasese on Wednesday to find the refugees and see what had happened.</p>
<p>"We have received reports that the population at the Kasese camps may have moved from the sites," said Stromberg. "We were told a military operation was under way in the region and we are now very disturbed about these reports of killings."</p>
<p>Emmanuel Kamanzi, rebel liasion officer with U.N. agencies, denied permission for the flight had been denied, saying agencies asked too late and the security situation was unclear.</p>
<p>Asked about the killings, he told Reuters: "Soldiers of the (rebel) alliance couldn't do that. On the contrary, it was ex-FAR (former Rwandan Hutu troops) who attacked the refugees."</p>
<p>"The military (rebels) have not killed people just for the sake of it. But if there was combat then of course people will be killed," he added in Kisangani, taken by rebels on March 15.</p>
<p>The Hutus fled Rwanda in 1994 and are collectively accused by minority Tutsis of genocide in Rwanda in the same year.</p>
<p>They arrived at their Kasese camps in mid-March after six months of trekking over volcanic rock and through bush and jungle in a vain attempt to flee the Tutsi-backed rebels.</p>
<p>Kabila bowed to international pressure on April 5 and agreed to an airlift to repatriate 100,000 Rwandan refugees at Kasese and further south towards Ubundu. But it has failed to start.</p>
<p>Angry Zaireans blocked aid workers and journalists from reaching Kasese on Monday and Tuesday and looted food aid.</p>
<p>Witnesses said villagers attacked the camps on Tuesday to avenge the killing of six people in Kasese village on Monday. Rebels swept the area after the killings, which were blamed by local people on Rwandan Hutu extremists among the refugees.</p>
<p>But a woman wounded in the same attack on Monday said she was shot by men who resembled the Tutsi-dominated rebels.</p>
<p>"The soldiers wore uniform. They were tall and thin and I heard them speaking Kinyarwanda. They were not refugees," said Mayaza Apaijoma, 20, at a Catholic hospital after being shot.</p>
<p>The testimony was the latest sign of a concerted attempt by rebels to destabilise aid operations and block the U.N. airlift.</p>
<p>The rebel-appointed governor of Zaire's Eastern Province said on Sunday the airlift should not start until May 5 because of a cholera epidemic. But the World Health Organisation in Geneva said the outbreak was not big enough to be an epidemic.</p>
<p>The refugees have fled 600 km (375 miles) since last October and more than 1,500 have denied at the camps south of Kisangani.</p>
