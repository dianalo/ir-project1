<p>An American being held in North Korea on espionage charges has told a Swedish diplomat that he has not been mistreated but denies having confessed to spying, the State Department said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Spokesman Nicholas Burns, naming the American officially for the first time as Carl Hunziker, said diplomat Ake Lafquist had reported that he was in good health and "in reasonably good spirits considering his circumstances."</p>
<p>In the absence of U.S. relations with Pyongyang, Sweden is representing Washington in the case of Hunziker, who was arrested on Aug. 24 after crossing into North Korea from China.</p>
<p>Burns told a news briefing that Lafquist was allowed to see Hunziker last Friday and Saturday at a hotel in the town of Shinuiju, a four-hour, 155-mile (250 km) train ride from Pyongyang.</p>
<p>"Mr Hunziker told the Swedish diplomat that he wishes to be released and to return to the United States," Burns said. "He absolutely denies the charges the North Koreans have made against him."</p>
<p>"He reports that he never made a confession that he was involved in espionage. He only signed a general statement about his background and about how he came into North Korea, which I believe was over the Yalu River," the spokesman added.</p>
<p>North Korea's state news agency says it has been "proved by investigation" that Hunziker was a spy for South Korea and that he will have to "take appropriate penal responsibility."</p>
<p>Burns reiterated previous statements that the United States considered the charges against Hunziker to be "absolutely false," and again demanded his release. Washington was "deeply concerned about his fate," he added.</p>
<p>In U.S. media interviews, members of Hunziker's family have said the 26-year-old divorcee went to South Korea to do Christian missionary work. It remains unclear what he was doing in China or why he entered North Korea.</p>
<p>Asked what value could be placed on Hunziker's statements to Lafquist, given the likelihood of North Korean surveillance of their conversation, Burns said: "We assume it was not a private conversation."</p>
<p>"(Hunziker's) circumstances are he is being held by autocrats, a dictatorial regime, which sometimes terrorises its prisoners, so we understand all that and we take that as a given," he added.</p>
