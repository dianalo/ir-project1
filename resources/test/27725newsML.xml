<headline>Oil up on Iraqi incursions, dollar suported.</headline>

<p>Oil prices rose sharply on Monday as dealers rushed to buy after the United Nations put off oil sales by Iraq following weekend incursions by its troops into Kurdish areas.</p>
<p>The renewed tensions in the Middle East also helped boost London share prices and gave limited support to the dollar, often a safe haven currency.</p>
<p>But other key European bourse showed little movement and dealers on various European markets said the Labor Day holiday in the United States was expected to dampen the enthusiasm to trade on this side of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>October futures for benchmark Brent crude opened 70 cents a barrel higher at $21.48 on London's International Petroleum Exchange after the United Nations delayed implementation of an oil-for-food deal that would allow Baghdad to re-enter oil markets for the first time in six years.</p>
<p>Oil prices later extended their gains to $1 at one point.</p>
<p>"We can't expect Iraqi oil in the near future and distillate demand is still there for the winter," said Alastair Harris at brokers MeesPierson Derivatives in London.</p>
<p>Buoyant oil shares in turn led the London stock market, Europe's biggest, to recoup some of its recent losses.</p>
<p>"Sterling is a petro-currency and we'll get a lift from oil stocks on the back of the oil price," one trader said.</p>
<p>But the Frankfurt bourse was quietly lower and expected to stay relatively inactive due to the U.S. holiday. The inclination to trade was similarly lacking in Paris, where the market fluctuated narrowly in quiet trading.</p>
<p>"With New York closed today, it's very calm and likely to stay that way," said one Paris trader.</p>
<p>Traders said the bourse, which has fallen for the past five sessions, will probably trade in a narrow range ahead of U.S. August jobs data on Friday and the French 1997 budget on September 10.</p>
<p>But Euro Disney shares rallied more than four percent after Chairman Philippe Bourguignon said it was on track to show a second annual profit.</p>
<p>Currency dealers reported limited dollar support so far from tensions in northern Iraq, with U.S. forces in the region put on high alert at the weekend. They were watching closely for further developments.</p>
<p>"We tend to think this is not a very important factor at the moment," said Thomas Rayner, international economist at Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull. "It's another story to keep an eye on but if things do escalate, it could have some bearing."</p>
<p>The main talking points for the dollar are news on Tuesday on the U.S. NAPM purchasing managers' index for August and, more importantly, Friday's August non-farm payrolls figures. The figures may hold clues on where U.S. interest rates might be going and when.</p>
<p>French President Jacques Chirac said at the weekend he wanted the dollar to rise. He and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Sunday also reaffirmed their joint support for a European Union single currency, as planned, in 1999.</p>
<p>The mark weakened a little in early business on Monday and the French franc, the victim of recent market concern over social unrest and barriers on the way to monetary union, looked vulnerable, dealers said.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 109.08 yen and 1.4832 marks, compared with 108.70 and 1.4800 in late European business on Friday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 index was up 9.6 at 3,877.2 after losing 17.4 points on Friday.</p>
<p>Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index was down 6.90 at 2,536.93 to follow Friday's loss of 16.23.</p>
<p>In Paris the CAC-40 index, which slipped 6.95 points on Friday, was up 2.23 at 1,972.84.</p>
<p>In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 31.44 points to 5,616.21 on Friday.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $386.90 an ounce in the morning, compared with Friday's close of $386.35. It was helped higher by strength in silver, which gained four cents to $5.20.</p>
