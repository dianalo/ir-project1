<p>Oil products ended flat in the Mediterranean on Friday, except for high sulphur fuel oil, which picked up on good demand.</p>
<p>Gasoline was flat to slightly weaker with some material tentatively touted, but sellers not regarded desperate to sell.</p>
<p>Tupras said it had awarded two tenders to buy a total of 55,000 tonnes of gasoline -- one to Vitol for 30,000 tonnes at a premium of minus $5.25, and the second for 25,000 tonnes from Dutch company Trafigura at a premium of minus $5.36 per tonne.</p>
<p>On the naphtha front, material remained fairly scarce but traders said there were small pockets of supply available.</p>
<p>Tupras awarded a sell tender for 20,000 tonnes of naphtha at a premium of plus $7.11 per tonne to Glencore.</p>
<p>Gas oil was steady with premiums holding firm. There was some talk of shipping 0.2 percent material northwards, but nothing was seen getting fixed. Non Russian 0.2 percent was still holding onto high fob quotes +$3-4.</p>
<p>Russian material was also around high fob +$4, but there was a definite scarcity of large cargoes which continue to be drawn eastwards towards strong Asian markets.</p>
<p>High sulphur fuel oil was in demand but supply poor. Bids were heard near $83-$84 fob but no corresponding offers seen.</p>
<p>Tenders to buy from Portugal and Tunisia, and a cargo trade out of the U.K. at a healthy $80 were boosting the market. Demand was seen from Turkey, Romania, Spain and a French major.</p>
<p>A 25,000 tonne piece from an Italian refinery was held over until Monday after rousing good interest.</p>
<p>"I'm bullish on high sulphur because there's so little offer around," said one trader. "But its the reverse on low sulphur."</p>
<p>One percent cracked followed Northwest Europe's weakness, with the market talking around $100 cif. No deals were seen done.</p>
