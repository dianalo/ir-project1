<headline>Norwegian index up on industry, insurance shares.</headline>

<p>Norway's stock market was spearheaded by buoyant offshore and insurance shares to hit a record close on Thursday in heavy trade worth 1.1 billion crowns.</p>
<p>The Total share index gained 0.75 percent to close at 949.77 points, reversing Wednesday's losses. They had resulted partly from a slump in Saga Petroleum shares after the oil company bought British-based Santa Fe Exploration for $1.23 billion,</p>
<p>Investors, who at first were negative to the acquisition, turned positive following news that Saga would get tax breaks under Norwegian law, dealers said.</p>
<p>Saga's A share climbed 7.46 percent to 108 crowns and the B share finished 6.42 percent higher at 99.50 crowns.</p>
<p>Saga accounted for 323 million crowns of total business.</p>
<p>Industrial conglomerate Norsk Hydro was the second most traded share at 106 million crowns and closed 0.76 percent up at 333.50 crowns.</p>
<p>Insurance company Storebrand was another winner, finishing 1.06 percent higher at 38 crowns.</p>
<p>The industry index was up 0.97 percent, the insurance rose 0.95 percent while the shipping and banking indexes were flat.</p>
