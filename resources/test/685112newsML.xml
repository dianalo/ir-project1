<headline>NY precious metals end higher, except for gold.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-06-25</dateline>

<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures ended mostly higher Wednesday, with the exception of gold, which gave back the sessions gains near the close on fund selling, traders said.</p>
<p>"Overall it was a quiet day, with only moderate volumes, but gold still looks like its going lower after breaking below trendline support since April in the past week," said John Maruya, chief bullion dealer with Imperial Bank in California.  </p>
<p>COMEX August gold spent most of the session above Tuesday's close, but slumped near the close to end down 50 cents at $339.00, not far from the contract low at $338.50 seen Monday.</p>
<p>The momentum of the downtrend in gold has been slowly rising since mid-June, as COMEX open interest has risen to its highest levels since February at 185,491 contracts as of Tuesday, analysts noted.</p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold ended quoted $337.10/60, compared to the London Wednesday afternoon fix at $338.45 an ounce, and the New York close Tuesday around $337.50/00, and not far from the four year low at $336.90 on February 12.</p>
<p>But physical demand in the bullion market is again being noted at levels below $340 an ounce, as it was back in January this year, analysts noted.</p>
<p>World gold demand reached a record 771 tons in the first quarter of 1997, a 17 pct rise over 1996, and the highest quarterly gold demand ever recorded, according to the World Gold Council in a report last month.</p>
<p>Ongoing Asian demand for gold will eventually overpower speculative short positions, amounting to many hundreds of tonnes held by managed funds, Australian mining entrepreneur Joseph Gutnick said in a speech in Sydney overnight.</p>
<p>But the gold price may decline to $335 an ounce first, he warned.</p>
<p>COMEX July silver ended up 0.5 cent at $4.750, but with first notice day for July silver three trading sessions away on Monday June 30, the September contract now has more open interest. September silver ended up 0.6 cents at $4.805 an ounce.</p>
<p>Total COMEX silver volume also reached its highest level since April this week, before a 5,187 lot fall was seen Tuesday, as July positions were liqudated.</p>
<p>NYMEX July platinum ended up $2.10 at $412.00 an ounce, after seeing a session high at $416.50.</p>
<p>NYMEX June palladium expired at the close Wednesday, but still had 62 lots of open interest remaining as of Tuesday, while the active September contract ended up $2.25 at $181.00.</p>
<p>In the physical market, overnight lease rates for platinum group metals can still be as high as 250 pct, refining sources said, while one month platinum is quoted around 60 pct and one month palladium around 90 pct, due to the absence of Russian supplies.</p>
<p>Russian PGM exports, suspended for five months, are expected to resume in late June or early July. Russia supplies about 60 pct of the world's palladium and 20 pct of its platinum.</p>
<p>But Amplats (Anglo American Platinum Corp Ltd) said Wednesday it saw Russian supplies of platinum dropping by 42 pct to 700,000 ounces in 1997 from 1.22 million ounces last year.</p>
<p>Amplats is the major South African producer of platinum.</p>
<p>South African producers expect to supply about 9.5 pct more platinum this year or about 3.6 million ounces, Amplats managing director, Barry Davison, said.</p>
<p>"The fact that platinum and palladium prices have not collapsed shows not just how tight the market is at present, but also suggests the supply scare will result in increased inventory building fabricators over the coming months," one analyst said.</p>
