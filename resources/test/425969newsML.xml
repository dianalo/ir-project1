<p>Hungarian foreign minister Laszlo Kovacs said on Friday that meetings with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and other officials had reassured him of Hungary's prospects for joining NATO in the first round.</p>
<p>"The United States has indicated a very strong intention to implement (NATO) expansion as scheduled," Kovacs told reporters upon his return from a four-day trip to Washington.</p>
<p>He said he had returned with reassurances that "Hungary has quite good chances of joining NATO in the first round as a full member", along with Poland and the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>NATO allies are due to discuss expansion of the military alliance to include former communist states of Eastern Europe at a summit in Madrid in July. Washington wants the countries chosen at the summit to become NATO members in 1999.</p>
<p>Kovacs said Russian objections to NATO expansion should not be allowed to stand in the way, but added that he had said in Washington that Russia's role could not be ignored.</p>
<p>"I emphasised that Hungary regards it as very important and indispensable that Russia should participate in the overall European security architecture," said Kovacs, who met senators and Pentagon and White House officials in addition to Albright.</p>
<p>"I emphasised that we regard Russian-Hungarian bilateral relations as very important and...I also said that Russia regards Hungary's joining of NATO as a sovereign decision."</p>
<p>Kovacs said there had been no suggestion that Hungary's NATO entry should be delayed until a second round so that it would join with neighbouring Romania, whose prospects for NATO membership this year are deemed less favourable than Hungary's.</p>
<p>"The American side referred to the very strong lobbying that Romania is pursuing in order to accelerate their accession, which I said had the full support of Hungary," Kovacs said.</p>
<p>"We don't mind the acceleration of the accession of Romania but we would not accept slowing down the accession of Hungary in order to bring about the simultaneous accession," he added.</p>
<p>He said some U.S. Senators had expressed doubts about the necessity of expanding NATO and whether it was worth the cost, which one recent U.S. study estimated at some $30 billion over the next 12 years.</p>
<p>"I made my argument that the main problem (of the region) is the lack of stability," Kovacs said.</p>
<p>"That is why we regard Euro-Atlantic organisations and the expansion of them as the expansion of stability. You could ask, alternatively, how much would it cost not to expand NATO?"</p>
