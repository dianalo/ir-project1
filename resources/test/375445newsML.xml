<p>Prices in the gasoline market were stable despite mixed talks on market direction after some refinery shutdowns in Thailand, traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Traders differed in views on market direction after the shutdowns in Thailand with some saying routine maintenance would not affect the market while others said supplies would fall further.</p>
<p>Bangchak Petroleum Plc closed a 40,000 barrels-per-day crude distillation unit (CDU) for a 2-week scheduled maintenance in the second half of January.</p>
<p>At around the same time Star Petroleum Refinery Co shutdown part of its 130,000-bpd refining capacity for about one-week, the source said.</p>
<p>It's mainly a sellers' market at this moment as supplies are quite tight, said one bullish trader.</p>
<p>"There is no sign of supply easing and supplies should continue tightening following recent shutdowns," said a major of gasoline</p>
<p>However, trading interest remained thin, they added.</p>
<p>Gasoline 92-octane was bid at $27.20 per barrel for lifting March 4-8 and 97-octane was offered at $28.6 per barrel for lifting March 10-14, little changed from Wednesday's levels, traders said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, an European major sold a crago of unleaded 97-octane gasoline on Wednesday to a U.S. major at $28.70 per barrel lifting between February 27 and March 3.</p>
<p>Naphtha was little changed despite crude's fall in thin talk with naphtha March swaps sliding 20-15 cents per barrel to $23.50/$23.75.</p>
<p>(Prices are in dollars per barrel)</p>
