<p>Prime Minister John Major's Conservative government shrugged off a surprise defeat in parliament on Monday night and said it would not change election tactics.</p>
<p>The opposition took advantage of ministers being away at a cabinet brainstorming session at the prime minister's country residence to stage a late-night ambush in the House of Commons on a vote over government education plans</p>
<p>The government shrugged off the defeat, saying it would try to reinstate the plans -- to allow schools which have opted out of local authority control to expand -- when the Education Bill goes to the House of Lords, parliament's upper chamber.</p>
<p>Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell dismissed suggestions that the government was in trouble and risked being unable to hold on to power until Major's preferred election date of May 1.</p>
<p>"It's the prime minister's job to fix the date, not mine, I'm not going to speculate about that... Nobody's limping along," Dorrell told a BBC radio interviewer on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The government's defeat by 273 votes to 272 on an Education Bill amendment was not sufficiently serious to prompt a vote of confidence, which could push the government out of power if the Conservatives lost.</p>
<p>But it proved how difficult the main opposition Labour Party can make it for the government to keep the upper hand in parliament. Recent opinion polls have shown the Conservatives some 20 points behind Labour.</p>
<p>A breakdown in trust between Labour and the Conservatives has led to the end of cross-party arrangements allowing members of parliament detained elsewhere to miss votes without affecting the result, offering Labour plenty of chances for ambushes.</p>
<p>Labour's education spokesman David Blunkett mocked at Major's chances of survival, saying the government "announces that it is going through to May and can't even get through the evening".</p>
<p>Don Foster, education spokesman for the minority opposition Liberal Democrats, told a radio interviewer his party would now seek further chances to defeat the government.</p>
<p>"This particular attempt to expand opportunities for grant-maintained schools, without taking into account the wishes of other schools in the area, we didn't like that," he said.</p>
<p>"We defeated it and anything else the government bring we will try to defeat them on that."</p>
