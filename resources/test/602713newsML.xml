<p>The IWA-Canada union said on Wednesday it applied to the British Columbia Labor Relations Board in an effort to bring all the operations of Pacific Forest Products Ltd under one set of contract negotiations.</p>
<p>Pacific Forest has withdrawn from the bargaining agency that represents lumber companies on the British Columbia coast. The union said the company was seeking to gain the upper hand in bargaining by negotiating separately with employees at each of its six mills and logging camps.</p>
<p>"We are making this application...to ensure there is a single set of negotiations and a single collective agreement," union president Dave Haggard said.</p>
<p>The union made a similar application to the board for MacMillan Bloedel Ltd, which earlier withdrew from industrywide bargaining but recently rejoined.</p>
<p>Negotiations began recently on a new contract for lumber workers in the province to replace an agreement that expires on June 14.</p>
