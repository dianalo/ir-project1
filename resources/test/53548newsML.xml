<p>IATA said its recent Cargo Partnership Symposium in Paris had seen forwarders and airlines identify a number of areas for co-operation in the airfreight sector.</p>
<p>"These entail the development of a joint structure to form an immediate plan to implement EDI messaging, tracking and tracing and bar code labelling," Colin Mills, IATA's Director, cargo services, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"It's possible that working groups of forwarders and airlines could be set up to discuss these areas in the not-too-distant future but the exact framework has yet to be decided on," Mills added.</p>
<p>The 13 forwarding groups and 22 airline cargo divisions which attended the symposium are to meet in March 1997 to review progress and establish future objectives and implementation plans, Mills said.</p>
<p>The keynote speakers at the symposium were Traude Frigge, vice-president cargo of Austrian Airlines, Klaus Geissler, airfreight director of forwarders Schenker and Philippe Oddonne, head of distribution of French manufacturing group Yves St Laurent.</p>
<p>Conference moderator and industry consultant John Harnett closed the symposium by saying: "In bringing together the leading players in the industry, the symposium has lifted the clouds of blame and distrust that have for too long lingered over it."</p>
<p>"The strategic decision-making process is now at the right level and must be maintained at that level to ensure continued focus, direction and above all, implementation."</p>
