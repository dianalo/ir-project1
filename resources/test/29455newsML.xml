<dateline>PARAMARIBO, Surinam 1996-09-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>These are the key facts about Surinam where a vote takes place on Thursday to choose a new president.</p>
<p>POPULATION: 420,000, of whom 33.5 percent are Creoles of mixed European-African descent, 34 percent East Indians known locally as Hindustanis, 18 percent Indonesians, 8.5 percent Bush Negroes -- descendants of slaves who fled plantations in the 17th Century -- two percent Amerindians and four percent Chinese, European and Lebanese.</p>
<p>LANGUAGE: Dutch (official). English is widely spoken and local dialect Sranan Tongo (also known as Taki-Taki) is understood by all ethnic groups.</p>
<p>RELIGION: Moslem, Hindu, Christian.</p>
<p>CAPITAL: Paramaribo (population 240,000)</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHY: 66,090 square miles (163,820 sq km) at the northern tip of South America, bounded by French Guiana to the east, Guyana to the west, Brazil to the south and the Atlantic Ocean to the north.</p>
<p>GOVERNMENT: A constitutional democracy with a president elected to a five year term by a two-thirds majority of the 51- member National Assembly following parliamentary elections held every five years. Elections in May failed to produce a single party or coalition with a two-thirds majority. Under the constitution a new president must be chosen by a simple majority of the 869-member United Peoples Assembly which includes national, regional and district representatives.</p>
<p>ARMY: The armed forces consists of about 2,000 troops, the majority of whom are deployed as ground security forces. A small air force and navy/coast guard also exist.</p>
<p>ECONOMY: Mainstay of the economy is bauxite mining and processing of mineral into alumina and aluminum, which account for over 70 percent of exports. Surinam is world's sixth largest bauxite producer. Surinam has vast timber resources and the government is selling logging concessions to Indonesian timber companies, much to the disgust of environmental groups.</p>
<p>In 1993 the government began to implement a programme of free- market reforms. The reforms led to a massive currency devaluation and inflation of 365 percent in 1994. By 1995, the currency had stabilised and inflation dropped to 50 percent.</p>
<p>HISTORY: The Netherlands received Surinam in 1667 from Britain under the Breda peace agreement in exchange for New Amsterdam, now New York City. During the 19th Century England and France both briefly claimed sovereignty with eventual independence from the Netherlands coming in 1975. Since independence Surinam has suffered two military coups, seven years of dictatorship and widespread guerrilla activity.</p>
<p>A group of junior officers, led by military sports instructor Desi Bouterse, seized power in February 1980, overthrowing the governing coalition led by President Henk Arron.</p>
<p>In December 1982, 15 critics of the military government, were shot by the military. The Netherlands cut off aid that was not restored until civilian rule was restored in 1988.</p>
<p>In 1986, Ronny Brunswijk, Bouterse's former bodyguard, led a guerrilla uprising against the government. Brunswijk's Jungle Commando, of about 1,000 Bush Negroes and foreign mercenaries waged a war against the army that cost hundreds of lives and drove about 12,000 refugees into neighbouring French Guiana.</p>
<p>Under growing international pressure, Bouterse called elections in 1987. Though Bouterese was defeated at the polls, he stayed on as army commander and continued to hold sway behind the scenes.</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve 1990, angered by the terms of a peace accord with the rebels and a public snub by Dutch officials on a visit to the Netherlands Bouterse staged a second coup. Bouterse eventually allowed new elections in 1991 won by the New Front coalition led by former education minister Ronald Venetiaan.</p>
<p>In mid-1992 the government and Brunswijk's group signed a formal peace to end the civil war. Bouterse resigned as head of the armed forces in 1993 amid allegations he had used his position to enrich himself. He now heads the main opposition National Democratic Party.</p>
