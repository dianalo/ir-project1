<p>Veronika Borash's neighbours hate her and they are not shy about expressing their feelings.</p>
<p>"At 2 a.m. everybody in the building is awoken by her dogs!" one neighbour complained aloud as Borash passed by to enter her apartment building.</p>
<p>"Isn't there not enough space on their earth for us all? Can they really bother you that much?" Borash snapped back.</p>
<p>But the neighbour may not be exaggerating. Borash, 59, a retired engineer, has as many as 52 dogs in her one-room apartment on the outskirts of Moscow and it can get a bit noisy at times.</p>
<p>She has made her apartment into a kennel for stray dogs and says they are like family. She seems not to notice the overpowering stench or the tiny insects that have also taken hold in her home</p>
<p>Many of the dogs sleep on the bottom two rungs of a three-level bunk bed and she devotedly collects leftovers from local schools to feed them.</p>
<p>As Muscovites have suffered through tough economic times, the number of stray animals has risen and it has devolved on animal lovers to take in the rejects or find them new homes.</p>
<p>"We don't have a single government service of this kind in the whole city," said Yekatarina Volkova, a retired translator who has about 10 dogs in her apartment.</p>
<p>"But it is very difficult for those who do this because people don't understand and hassle them."</p>
<p>Women like Borash and Volkova advertise in local newspapers to find new owners, but not every caller is ready for the responsibility of dog ownership.</p>
<p>"How old are you?" Volkova inquired after a caller said he wanted a dog. "Eight? Is your mother or your father home? Well, let's agree on the following -- call back when mum or dad is home."</p>
<p>When takers are few, the number of dogs grow in the home kennels. Last summer Borash had as many as 114 dogs.</p>
<p>"What's the matter with you?" she shouted as the wild barking of dozens of dogs drowned her out.</p>
<p>But then a moment later the dogs went silent and a smile returned to her face as looked upon those who are truly her constant companions.</p>
