<p>In one of General Motors Corp.'s busiest weekends ever for labor talks, the automaker still faced strike threats at two key parts plants Saturday after averting a walkout at a third late Friday.</p>
<p>Strike deadlines have come and gone for GM's catalytic converter plant in Oak Creek, Wis., and its metal stamping plant in Grand Rapids, Mich., but the United Auto Workers has agreed to continue negotiations at those facilities without work stoppages.</p>
<p>Strikes at either of the two factories could have a significant impact on GM's North American car and truck production.</p>
<p>The Oak Creek plant, near Milwaukee, produces exhaust system catalytic converters for nearly all of GM's North American car and truck models, and the Grand Rapids plant produces sheet metal parts for a variety of GM vehicles, including its all-new minivans.</p>
<p>Talks continued into the evening Saturday in Grand Rapids, while they had recessed for the night in Oak Creek. UAW officials said the midnight Thursday deadline in Oak Creek and the midnight Friday deadline in Grand Rapids had been extended indefinitely.</p>
<p>GM reached a tentative agreement late Friday for a new local labor contract at a foundry in Saginaw, Mich., averting a threatened strike by about 900 members of UAW Local 445. The foundry produces pistons, piston rods and transmission parts for a variety of GM vehicles.</p>
<p>The two sides also continued nearly round-the-clock negotiations to end a strike by 5,800 workers in its eighth week at GM's  Pontiac, Mich., pickup truck plant. Ron Miller, president of UAW Local 594, said GM has made some new proposals in recent days.</p>
<p>"There's been some movement on both sides, so that's encouraging," Miller said. "But I wouldn't say we're close to a settlement.</p>
<p>The union struck on April 22 over demands for more jobs to ease an increasing workload. Initial demands by the union called for GM to hire 600 new workers at the full-size pickup truck plant and related truck development facilities.</p>
<p>GM has resisted, saying it needs to reduce its work force to more competitive levels. A new-generation pickup truck slated to be built in Pontiac and two other plants will require</p>
<p>Until this week, talks at Pontiac and the three parts plants have moved slowly. Some analysts view the multiple strike deadlines as a move by the UAW to increase pressure for GM to settle the Pontiac walkout.</p>
<p>GM also still has unresolved local negotiations at several other facilities, including a Fairfax, Kan., car assembly plant.</p>
