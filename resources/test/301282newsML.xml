<p>Leaders of Austria's fragile coalition began an emergency meeting on Saturday in an atmosphere of tension and recrimination, boding ill for chances of ending a crisis gripping the year-old government.</p>
<p>Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party led by Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel are at daggers drawn over the privatisation of the country's second biggest bank, Creditanstalt-Bankverein.</p>
<p>The crisis meeting was called to try to restore unity and iron out differences over who should buy the 141-year-old flagship bank, long considered a conservative fiefdom.</p>
<p>But there was little sign that the two sides were any closer to patching up their row.</p>
<p>The conservatives insist that discussions should focus solely on the bank sale, but Vranitzky has demanded an explanation from the People's Party over a series of talks it has had with far right leader Joerg Haider.</p>
<p>"You know what, the style that the chancellor has adopted over setting the agenda, makes me want to vomit," conservative chief whip Andrea Khol told reporters as he entered the talks in some of the strongest language yet used during the row.</p>
<p>"Khol's comments...show just how edgy the feelings within the coalition are," Austrian news agency APA commented.</p>
<p>Haider, whose Freedom Party scored nearly 28 percent in European elections last October, said a final round of talks with the conservatives would take place on Monday, a day before parliament convenes in special session to debate the bank sale.</p>
<p>The conservatives and the far right can command a majority in parliament and if they decide to outvote the Social Democrats, the creaky coalition could collapse.</p>
<p>In a further sign of friction, Schuessel on Saturday indirectly called for the resignation of Social Democrat chief whip Peter Kostelka over offensive remarks he made about the conservatives.</p>
<p>"It is about time that the (Social Democrats) either distance themselves from his (Kostelka's) style, or they would be well advised to bid him a swift farewell," Schuessel told reporters after an early morning meeting of his party.</p>
<p>Schuessel and Khol were joined by conservative Economics Minister Johann Farnleitner, who himself came under a barrage of criticism this week from the Social Democrats over his handling of the introduction a new road tax.</p>
<p>Almost in Cold War summit-style, stern-faced members of the two parties sat opposite each other around a long oak table headed by Vranitzky. Reporters were allowed into the conference room before the meeting began.</p>
<p>The chancellor was joined by Finance Minister Viktor Klima, who has sole responsibility for choosing the winning bid for Creditanstalt, Kostelka and the Social Democrat financial councillor of the City of Vienna Rudolf Edlinger.</p>
<p>Vranitzky's party wants Creditanstalt to be sold to Bank Austria, which is effectively controlled by the Social Democrat-led City of Vienna.</p>
<p>The conservatives, together with Creditanstalt's management, favour an international consortium led by Italian-controlled insurer EA-Generali.</p>
<p>Klima has said he is bound by European Union law to sell the bank to the highest bidder, which banking industry sources say points to Bank Austria.</p>
<p>The finance minister has said he would make his decision before Tuesday, a move sure to infuriate Schuessel's party which has warned him to hold his fire before parliament meets.  REUTER</p>
