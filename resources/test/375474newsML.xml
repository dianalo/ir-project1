<p>Asia stock markets closed mixed on Wednesday, with Hong Kong registering the biggest reversal, as caution replaced early euphoria brought on by a powerful advance on Wall Street overnight.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index plunged 222.66 points, or 1.65 percent, to 13,239.95 after rumours resurfaced about the health of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>"It is all about Deng's health. I do not know how solid the rumours are, but after lunch the buyers disappeared," one index futures trader said.</p>
<p>Index futures fell in tandem with the cash market, with the February Hang Seng Index contract dropping to a low of 13,000, a drop of 420 points, on volume of more than 16,000 contracts.</p>
<p>"The fall was quite surprising and has caught everybody a bit wrong-footed," one broker said.</p>
<p>By contrast, stocks in Tokyo ended higher, although off the day's highs, inspired by a weak yen.</p>
<p>The key Nikkei 225 share Index ended up 278.10 points, or 1.51 percent, at 18,688.06. At one stage it reached 18,854.76.</p>
<p>"The weak yen is the only remedy left for the Japanese economy when the government tightens its fiscal policies," said Hiroyuki Nakai, chief investment strategist at Nikko Securities.</p>
<p>The yen's weakness reflected a recent and almost unrestrained advance in the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>Some of that momentum was lost on Thursday after a senior official of the Bundesbank, Germany's powerful central bank, reiterated concern about about the dollar's rise.</p>
<p>"I once more underline, it is not in the interest of the Bundesbank that the strength of the dollar goes further and further," Bundesbank vice-president Johann Wilhelm Gaddum said while attending a regional central bankers meeting in Bangkok.</p>
<p>Analysts said Gaddum's remarks reminded the market that the Group of Seven (G-7) major industrial nations could launch an attack in the foreign exchange market to stem the dollar's rise.</p>
<p>The dollar ended at 124.10/20 yen compared with 124.20/30 in New York on Wednesday, and at 1.6808/15 marks against 1.6890/95.</p>
<p>Wall Street's spectacular 103.52 point advance to 6,961.63 was sparked by a rally in the technology sector following strong earnings from semiconductor equipment maker Applied Materials. The upbeat mood quickly spilled over to other sectors.</p>
<p>A strengthening of the dollar against the mark and yen also aided the market, because it encouraged a flow of funds into U.S. shares, analysts said.</p>
<p>Korean stocks ended higher but off its highs on a bout of profit-taking. News that a high-ranking North Korean official, Hwang Jang-yop, had defected to the South had little impact on the market. It ended 4.21 points, or 0.59 percent, higher at 716.71.</p>
<p>Expectations of a recovery in the semiconductor market bolstered chip makers, traders said. Samsung Electronics, the world's leading chip maker, rose 2,700 won at 59,000.</p>
<p>Taiwan shares soared to a six-year high by the close, aided by Wall Street's gains. The weighted index closed 112.18 points, or 1.51 percent higher, at 7,536.28.</p>
<p>That surpassed Wednesday's 7,424.10 close, and was the highest since the market wound up at 7,857.01 on June 2, 1990.</p>
<p>Thai shares were battered by heavy foreign selling amid concerns over the baht's slide against the U.S. dollar. The SET Index fell 28.42 points, or 3.93 points, at 694.15.</p>
<p>Philippine shares forfeited early gains on the back of Wall Street's rise, and ended lower. The main index closed 4.10 points, or 0.12 percent, down at 3,335.73 points.</p>
<p>Jakarta shares hit a new high of 706.285, after touching a record high on Wednesday. The Jakarta Composite Index was up 5.23 points, or 0.75 percent, at 703.42.</p>
<p>Singapore stocks rallied, with the Straits Times Index up 25.68 points, or 1.15 percent, at 2,250.32, while Malaysian shares were up 6.12 points, or 0.49 percent, at 1,260.54.</p>
