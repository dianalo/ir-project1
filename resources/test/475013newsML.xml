<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy Dennis Ross met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday hoping to resolve a crisis in Middle East peacemaking.</p>
<p>Israel's Foreign Minister David Levy and Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai were due to join the talks launched by Washington to end an impasse over a resurgence of Jewish settlement building and Palestinian guerrilla violence.  </p>
<p>Earlier Ross met chief Palestinian peace negotiators Saeb Erekat and Mahmoud Abbas, also known as Abu Mazen.</p>
<p>Erekat said before their meeting the only way out of the crisis -- marked by nine days of clashes and an Islamist suicide bombing that killed three Israelis -- was for Israel to stop work on a Jewish settlement on a hilltop in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>"There is one item on the agenda: the current state of the peace process," Erekat told Reuters. "If Netanyahu orders the bulldozers to stop I think the peace process will be on track."</p>
<p>Asked whether Arafat's Palestinian Authority accepted Israel's demand it crack down on militants, Erekat said: "This has been our position, but we don't follow such demands by media lords like Netanyahu."</p>
