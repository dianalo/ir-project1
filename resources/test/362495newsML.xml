<headline>Collins Q1 results hurt by delivery delays.</headline>

<p>Collins Industries Inc said on Friday that delays in chassis deliveries due to suppliers' production problems will drag down its first-quarter results by $300,000, or $0.04 per share.</p>
<p>Collins' first fiscal quarter ended January 31..</p>
<p>Collins also said its bus operations would be hurt in the second quarter by Ford Motor Co's anticipated closing of its Lorain, Ohio plant. The shutdown is connected to a dispute between the United Auto Workers and Johnson Controls Inc, a key supplier for the Lorain plant.</p>
<p>Production problems at Ford and Chevrolet delayed first-quarter chassis deliveries to Collins, which makes buses, ambulances and terminal trucks, among other products.</p>
<p>Chevrolet has told Collins it can meet future delivery requirements, but a prolonged strike affecting Ford would hurt Collins' ambulance operations, the company said.</p>
