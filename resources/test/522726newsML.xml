<p>The North Korean Red Cross on Saturday agreed to hold talks with the South Korean Red Cross on food aid to the famine-threatened nation, a statement by the Southern organisation said.</p>
<p>The North Korean Red Cross accepted a proposal by its South Korean counterpart for "speedy and smooth" delivery of food and other relief materials and suggested their first meeting take place in Beijing on May 3, it said.  </p>
<p>Kang Young-hoon, president of the South Korean Red Cross, on Friday called for a meeting as soon as possible at the Korean border village of Panmunjom. It was not immediately clear if South Korea would agree to Beijing as the venue.</p>
<p>The South Korean Red Cross has made 14 relief shipments since November 1996 to North Korea. Religious and other civic groups in South Korea have pleged to raise about $20 million to ship 110,000 tonnes of corn to the communist state.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, North Korean representatives demanded substantial international assistance at a meeting in New York with South Korean and U.S. diplomats, gathered to hear Pyongyang's answer to a proposal for peace talks. The answer is expected later on Saturday.</p>
<p>Seoul and Washington maintain that large-scale aid can only be discussed during the four-nation peace talks, which include China.</p>
