<p>Colombia's consumer price index rose 21.63 percent in 1996, the National Statistics Department said Thursday.</p>
<p>The figure outstripped the 17 percent target set by the government and central bank at the start of the year.  </p>
<p>The rise was more than 2 percentage points higher than the 19.46 percent growth in the consumer price index seen in 1995.</p>
<p>The month-on-month increase in the consumer price index was 0.72 percent, lower than the 0.8 percent rise in November 1996. The consumer price index rose 0.92 percent in December 1995.</p>
<p>The annual consumer price index was driven up by heavy rises in the cost of education, up 36.74 percent, in rented accommodation, up 23.95 percent, and in the cost of health services, which increased 22.2 percent.</p>
<p>The price of transport rose 22.02 percent over the year, while the family food bill grew 18.2 percent during 1996 compared to 1995. The cost of clothing, however, grew less than 11 percent -- the smallest year-on-year variation of any of the sectors measured.</p>
