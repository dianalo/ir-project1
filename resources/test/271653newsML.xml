<p>Cuban authorities have ordered the correspondent for Russian news agency Itar Tass in Havana to leave the country because of alleged involvement in illegal gambling, his wife said on Saturday.</p>
<p>An Interior Ministry official at an immigration centre where Konstantin Zhukovski, 37, was being held told reporters that the centre had orders to expedite the departure of Zhukovski. He gave no other details.</p>
<p>Zhukovski's wife, Carmen, said he was due to leave Havana for Moscow on a flight late on Saturday night. She told reporters her husband was detained by police on Thursday evening in a private house in Havana where an illegal gambling session was being organised.</p>
<p>Carmen Zhukovski said that although her husband might have done wrong by taking part in the gambling and should have been punished, she felt that for him to be expelled in such a way was excessive.</p>
<p>Konstantin Zhukovski, who has been in Cuba for 2-1/2 years, was at the house as part of research for an article on nightlife in Havana and had expected to stay in Cuba for several more years, his wife said. He had not previously encountered any problems with authorities.</p>
<p>Gambling was outlawed in Cuba after the 1959 revolution which brought President Fidel Castro to power. Illegal betting does take place, and Cubans convicted of gambling offences face jail sentences of up to four years.</p>
<p>A consular official from the Russian Embassy visited Zhuvovski but declined to comment on the case to reporters.</p>
<p>Officials from the Foreign Ministry's press centre, which accredits foreign journalists, were not immediately available to comment.</p>
