<p>A court has ruled that priests have no rights under Britain's employment laws because they work for God and not an earthly employer.</p>
<p>Three appeal court judges decided on Friday that an Anglican curate, Rev. Alex Coker, had no right to take his case for unfair dismissal before an industrial tribunal.</p>
<p>"A minister of religion serves God and his congregation but does not serve an employer. There is not a contract that he will serve a terrestrial employer in the performance of his duties," the judge, Lord Justice Christopher Staughton, said.</p>
<p>Coker, 48, claimed he was unfairly sacked in 1994, losing the house and car that came with the 12,000 pounds a year job as a curate in southwest London, according to newspaper reports on Saturday.</p>
<p>Discussing the argument that priests worked for God, judge Staughton said: "I don't think you have an address for him so you will not be able to serve any documents."</p>
