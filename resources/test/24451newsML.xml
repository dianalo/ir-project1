<p>Wall Street stocks fell sharply on slim volume Friday after some surprisingly strong economic numbers undermined bonds and raised fears of higher interest rates.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 55.48 points at 5,592.17. The Dow had plunged 64.73 points to 5,647.65 Thursday, after being down nearly 90 points.</p>
<p>In the broader market, losing issues outpaced gainers by about 14 to 6 on sluggish volume of 168 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index lost 3.58 points to 1,141.45.</p>
<p>In the bond market, the 30-year Treasury bond fell 1-3/32, or $10.94 on a $1,000 bond, raising its yield to 7.13 percent from 7.04 percent at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>Analysts said the unexpectedly strong economic data reinforced fears that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to head off inflation as the economy continues to move ahead strongly.</p>
<p>The most important bit of data was the Chicago Purchasing Managers Index, a precursor to next week's National Association of Purchasing Management report.</p>
<p>The Chicago index jumped to a suprising 60.0 in August from 51.2 in July. A 51.9 reading had been expected.</p>
<p>"That is the report that more than any other was responsible for the sell-off in stocks and bonds," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany Corp.</p>
<p>"It hints that manufacturing activity was strong throughout the country and that will be reflected in next Tuesday's National Association of Purchasing Management figures and Friday's employment numbers.</p>
<p>"What the Chicago PMI tells you is to get ready for some unfriendly numbers next week."</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, the University of Michigan consumer confidence index for August rose to 95.3 from July's final reading of 94.7.</p>
<p>Slim volume and the fact that the numbers were a surprise to Wall Street exaggerated the reaction, said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer &amp; Co.</p>
<p>"A lot of participants are not active, so you get exaggerated moves," he said.</p>
<p>"The most significant factor is that all this is a surprise. The consensus had been for a significant slowdown in the economy, which would forestall an increase in interest rates."</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee is expected to rule on rates when it meets Sept. 24.</p>
<p>"This was supposed to be a good day," Johnson said. "The last three days before Labour Day have been strong for the last 17 years." The market will be closed Monday for Labour Day.</p>
<p>Among the day's special situations, Boatmen's Bancshares jumped 10-13/16 to 53-3/4 and topped the Nasdaq market's most active list on news it will be acquired by NationsBank Corp.</p>
<p>NationsBank was down 7-1/4 at 85-1/8 in active trading on the NYSE.</p>
<p>Dell Computer was up one at 67-5/9 on news that it would replace Varity Corp. in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index after the close of trading Sept. 5.</p>
