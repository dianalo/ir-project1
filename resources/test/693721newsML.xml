<p>The New Zealand dollar shed half a cent, interest rates fell and the share market rallied 1.4 percent after the central Reserve Bank endorsed a bigger than expected easing on Friday</p>
<p>The bank surprised markets by endorsing a 100 basis point easing where the market had mostly expected about 75 points at most.</p>
<p>RBNZ Governor Don Brash said the economy had slowed faster than the bank had expected, easing inflation pressures.</p>
<p>It now predicted inflation would halve to 1.0 percent in the coming year and stabilise there for the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Dealers said the New Zealand dollar was likely to come under further selling pressure under the lower interest rate environment.</p>
<p>The kiwi closed just above 68 U.S. cents and a test below that was likely next week, dealers said.</p>
<p>The RBNZ said it wanted its new Monetary Conditions Index (MCI) to average 825 in the September quarter but it would tolerate a 50 basis point move either side of that level.</p>
<p>On Friday the index ended at 777, close to the theoretical limit, and markets are likely to continue testing the bank's tolerance level on the MCI -- a composition of the 90-day bank bill and New Zealand dollar Trade-Weighted Index rates.</p>
<p>"The market will definitely try and test the bands that (Reserve Bank Governor Don) Brash was referring to -- 50 points either side of their desired range," said Bankers Trust chief dealer Sean Brown.</p>
<p>Brown said the RB had been brave to ease by as much as it did but market sentiment would be to test on the downside.</p>
<p>"Given that the RBNZ is going to allow rates to come off by as much as they are going to allow in the second half of 1997, any test below 775 is going to meet quite strong rhetoric from the RB," Brown said.</p>
<p>Key support at US$0.6820 was broken late in the session with U.S. investment houses prominent amongst the sellers.</p>
<p>"The way is now open to sub-68 cents," said a chief dealer.</p>
<p>The share market staged a broad-based rally as investors welcomed the new, friendlier, monetary environment.</p>
<p>John Rattray at brokers Ord Minnett said the rally in interest rates and the lower dollar gave the market a much needed shot in the arm and the market's rise was unusual in that it was very broad-based.</p>
<p>Stocks with purely domestic exposure performed strongly, as did exporters seen benefiting from the lower dollar.</p>
<p>"What the market has reacted to is the greater certainty. The market perceives interest rates remaining lower," he said.</p>
<p>"The equity market is susceptible to interest rate moves and there is probably a bit of a perception that we are passing through a trough."</p>
<p>In the debt market short rates ended 10 basis points lower, as did short bonds, while long bonds moved half that.</p>
<p>Bond dealers said the market had in the back of its mind the looming increase in supply in the long end, after the government in Thursday budget announced a bigger than expected bond tender and a new 10-year benchmark.</p>
