<p>IBCA, the European credit rating agency said on Thursday it affirmed its AA minus long-term and A1 short-term ratings for Bass Plc.</p>
<p>"Bass' ratings reflect its position as a broadly based brewing and leisure group that enjoys strong market positions in all its operations," IBCA said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said the substantial sums of cash generated give the group scope to grow its businesses, by acquisition if necessary, without unduly weakening its financial structure. IBCA said present gearing is modest, coverage ratios are sound and the debt profile is prudent.  </p>
<p>"Despite generally difficult market conditions, Bass' brewing operations remain buoyant, driven by the success of new products," the statement said.</p>
<p>Although no final MMC decision on its proposed Carlsberg-Tetley acquisition is expected this side of the election, IBCA said there was only a limited downside should the deal not be acceptable. There would be considerable scope for cost savings should it go ahead, the agency said.</p>
<p>Hotel operations continue to perform well, aided by a recovery in US business travel and the strength of the Holiday Inn brand.</p>
