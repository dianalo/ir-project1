<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke, defending his quarter point rise in British interest rates on Wednesday, said timely adjustment of monetary policy could keep rates "within a very narrow band".</p>
<p>"Monetary policy has to be adjusted to protect against inflation," Clarke told the House of Commons at question time.</p>
<p>"If one acts in good time on a modest scale, inflation pressures will be snuffed out and our interest rates move within a very narrow band...and that is the best assurance for the future," Clarke added.</p>
