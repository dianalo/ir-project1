<p>Former Brazilian President Itamar Franco said on Thursday he would leave his current post and run in next year's presidential race.</p>
<p>"I am, in effect, a candidate for the presidency of the republic," Franco told a news conference, where he announced he would resign as Brazil's representative to the Organisation of American States to concentrate on his campaign.</p>
<p>Franco was elected vice president under Fernando Collor in 1989 and became president in 1992 when Collor resigned over a corruption scandal. He has repeatedly hinted he might run for the top job in 1998 and claims he deserves credit for the Real Plan, an inflation-slashing economic programme introduced by his finance minister, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who is now president.</p>
<p>Brazil's constitution prevents presidents, state governors and mayors from running for second consecutive terms, but Cardoso was looking to the Senate to approve a constitutional amendment that would allow him to run for re-election next year. It has already been passed by the Chamber of Deputies.</p>
<p>Franco met Cardoso late on Wednesday to inform him of their likely showdown and said the president had found his decision "understandable." The former leader, who is not a member of any political party, said he would meet with left and right-wing parties to build a platform for his shot at the presidency.</p>
<p>An opinion poll published in March by the private Ibope polling company found Franco would win just 3 percent, compared with 46 percent for Cardoso, if the latter is allowed to run for a second term.</p>
