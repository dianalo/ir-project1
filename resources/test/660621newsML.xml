<p>Albanian Socialist opposition leader Fatos Nano appealed to the Greek government on Friday to help hundreds of thousands of illegal Albanians in Greece go home to vote in June 29 national elections.</p>
<p>Nano, who was to address an election rally in central Athens later on Friday, asked Greek authorities to facilitate the easy return of voters who lack proper visas for Greece.</p>
<p>"There must not be a negative climate which will prevent Albanians from voting for fear they will not be able to return to Greece," Nano told reporters after meeting Prime Minister Costas Simitis and Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos.</p>
<p>Greece assured Nano that illegal Albanians would be allowed to leave, vote and get back without proper visas.</p>
<p>"As in all previous Albanian elections, we will simplify the departure and entry procedures for those who go back to vote," foreign ministry spokesman Costas Bikas told Reuters.</p>
<p>Police said they granted a permit to Nano, who is in Athens meeting Greek government officials before the election, to speak at the central Kannigos Square on Friday evening and at least 7,000 people were expected to attend.</p>
<p>Foreign ministry officials said Greece did not want to appear as taking sides in the Albanian election but was eager for some normalcy to return to its impoverished northern neighbour.</p>
<p>Tensions have been mounting as Albania heads for the June 29 poll, seen as its best hope to restore peace after months of lawlessness and violence, prompted by the collapse of fraudulent pyramid money schemes earlier this year.</p>
<p>Most of the Albanians living in Greece had invested their savings in the pyramids and many blame the government of President Sali Berisha, a right-wing Democrat, for not protecting them.</p>
<p>Greek defence ministry officials said a plan was being worked out to provide armed escorts for a convoy of buses taking Albanians from Greece across the border.</p>
<p>Army or police units could be used to take the buses up to the border, where patrols would be doubled to prevent a possible outburst of violence from spilling over into Greece, they said.</p>
<p>Violence has already marred the election campaign in Albania, with seven people injured in a shooting incident on the sidelines of a Berisha rally in the central town of Elbasan on Thursday.</p>
<p>The election will be monitored by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and other observers, who have voiced concern over security and practical arrangements for the vote.</p>
