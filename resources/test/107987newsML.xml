<p>Brazil's gross domestic product is set to rise 2.5-3.0 percent in 1996, and 4.0-5.0 percent in 1997, said Jose Guilherme dos Reis, head of the economic department at the private National Industry Confederation (CNI).</p>
<p>The CNI lowered its forecast for industrial output growth to 1.5 percent in 1996 from a previous 2.0 percent.</p>
<p>But dos Reis said stronger than expected growth in agriculture and other sectors led the CNI to forecast GDP growth of up to 3.0 percent, higher than a previous forecast of 2.5 percent.  </p>
<p>Dos Reis said the CNI expected Brazil to end 1996 with a $2.0-3.0 billion trade deficit, a figure likely to rise in 1997.</p>
<p>The deficit would rise as a natural consequence of growth in the economy as a whole, he said, adding that measures to stimulate exports, such as their recent exemption from so-called ICMS tax, would not narrow the deficit.</p>
