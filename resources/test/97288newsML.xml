<text>
<p>The European Union's monetary committee is to hold a scheduled meeting on Tuesday, monetary sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>The sources would not say whether the top central bank and treasury officials who usually attend would discuss the return of the lira to the Exchange Rate Merchanism (ERM).</p>
<p>Major ERM decisions like currency realignments or admission of new members are usually taken at weekends.</p>
<p>The agenda of the meeting involves further discussions on a stability pact for the future European single currency and a new ERM for the countries which are not part of the Euro from the start.</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi said after a meeting with French President Jacques Chirac on Friday that Italy would ask for "immediate, rapid" talks on the level at which the lira will be readmitted.</p>
<p>The lira was forced out of the ERM in September 1992 together with the pound after intense market speculation. -- Brussels newsroom  322 2876841</p>
