<p>Germany must do more to lighten the cost load on employers if it is to make the shift to a modern service-led economy and cut record post-war unemployment, the head of a leading trade group said on Friday.</p>
<p>"If Germany does not become a service economy, it will go under," Michael Fuchs, president of the Federal Association of Wholesalers and Exporters (BGA), told a news conference.</p>
<p>He said modest cuts in welfare overheads recently enacted by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government were too small and had not yet fed through to companies, which would also be hit by a cabinet decision on Thursday to hike pension charges.</p>
<p>And he hit back at this week's attack by Kohl's parliamentary right-hand man Wolfgang Schaeuble that employers had "glaringly failed" to create new jobs thanks to the government measures.</p>
<p>"It is wrong to attack employers as though the cost burden had already been lifted. It hasn't happened yet," Fuchs said.</p>
<p>Kohl's centre-right coalition recently passed a package of welfare cuts, including reducing sick pay, but trade unions are fiercely defending hard-won entitlements written into their collective pay deals.</p>
<p>Fuchs criticised politicians for concentrating too much on traditional industries which drove Germany's post-war economic miracle, and ignoring the underdeveloped service sector.</p>
<p>Germany lost 825,000 industrial jobs between 1989 and 1995, while 1.6 million were created in the services sector. Services now account for 50 percent of gross domestic product; industry just 35 percent, he said.</p>
<p>But, in comparison with the U.S., which employs 75 percent of workers in services, Germany lags with just 61 percent.</p>
<p>Hopes for reducing Germany's four million jobless total depend on opening the way for service companies to operate in a deregulated environment, Fuchs said.</p>
<p>That would require opening up Germany's collective pay bargaining system to allow the creation of lower-paid jobs.</p>
<p>Fuchs, noting that Germany's unemployment rate, at over 10 percent, was double that in the U.S., said that even so-called "McJobs" were better than long-term unemployment.</p>
<p>That view was not shared by Margret Moenig-Raane, head of the HBV white-collar trade union, who told reporters she would not accept changes to the collective pay bargaining structure and wanted to keep full sick pay benefits.</p>
<p>"It is unbelievably naive to say that reducing sick pay will help to create jobs," Moenig-Raane said.</p>
<p>"If the wholesale sector wants to become a stronger service provider in future, it should not demotivate workers through the social standards of primitive capitalism," she added.</p>
<p>Despite their differing views, the BGA and HBV began a two-day conference on Friday to try and find common ways to tackle Germany's jobs crisis. They said they hoped then to present joint proposals for action to Chancellor Kohl.</p>
