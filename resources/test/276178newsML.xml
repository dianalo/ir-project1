<p>Israel's Elta Electronics Industries Ltd said on Wednesday that it had won a $115 million contract from the government of Switzerland for communications intelligence systems (comint).</p>
<p>The equipment, which will supplied over three years or more, will be used by the Swiss army as part of its programme to improve comint capabilities, said Elta, a wholly owned subsidiary of state-owned Israel Aircraft Industries Ltd.</p>
<p>The equipment is used for detecting, intercepting and analyzing communications traffic and employs advanced embedded digital spectrum-processing technology. A prototype system was ordered by the Swiss in 1992 and subsequent improvements were developed in cooperation with the Swiss army, an Elta spokesman said.</p>
