<p>Latvia's controversial new finance minister, at the centre of a row between Prime Minister Andris Shkele and President Guntis Ulmanis that caused the premier to resign, himself quit on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Latvia's political crisis erupted after Ulmanis called on parliament not to back Finance Minister Vassily Melnik although he had been proposed by Shkele and a leading government party.</p>
<p>Ulmanis wanted parliament to reject Melnik after reports that he had been investigated under anti-corruption laws.</p>
<p>"At his own request he (Melnik) has been dismissed," a spokesman for Shkele told Reuters.</p>
<p>The spokesman did not give a reason for Melnik's sudden departure. He said the resignation would probably not have a big influence on the political crisis.</p>
<p>The prosecutor's office has confirmed it investigated Melnik for possible conflict of interests but found no wrongdoing.</p>
<p>Shkele's spokesman said the prime minister would now be acting finance minister.</p>
<p>Shkele's resignation announcement was a shock to most Latvians who regarded him as a key force in pushing ahead with reforms the small Baltic state launched after it quit the former Soviet Union in 1991.</p>
<p>Shkele said he could not continue in office when the president and political elite were accusing him of forcing "amoral" decisions upon them by asking for Melnik to be confirmed in office.</p>
<p>Ulmanis has already had talks with politial parties after Shkele quit as he tries to decide whether to ask Shkele to stand as premier again or find another candidate.</p>
<p>Shkele became prime minister at the end of 1995, a compromise candidate in a squabbling parliament that had already twice failed to form a government.</p>
<p>Shkele is head of an eight-party coalition that spans the politial spectrum. He has managed to push through key legislation despite internal bickering.</p>
<p>He has said his main achievement was passing a deficit-free budget in 1997 but he has also pushed hard to speed the privatisation of key state companies and introduce other liberal economic measures.</p>
