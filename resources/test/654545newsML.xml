<p>European Union countries will have to harmonise their bank holidays to make good use of the planned Target payments and transactions system, a Bank of Finland official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"There are now only two pan-European bank holidays ... and it is clear that it would create a mess if Target were to be open one day in some countries but closed in other," Olli-Pekka Lehmussaari, head of the intervention office at the Finnish central bank, told a seminar about EMU arranged by training institute IIR Finland.</p>
<p>"This will be a big issue in the next couple of months in the EU", he said, adding that in Finland, for instance, this would be of relevance in labour market negotiations about bank employees' work contracts.</p>
