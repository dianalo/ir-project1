<p>ARCO sold about 150,000 barrels of Oseberg crude from its Seaway pipeline to a U.S. refiner, averting an unusual delivery into the February NYMEX contract, traders said Wednesday.</p>
<p>A delivery into NYMEX would have been a headache for the company forced to take delivery of Oseberg instead of benchmark West Texas Intermediate/Cushing would seek to resell it or buy out of the deal, traders said.</p>
<p>Under the contract specifications, the seller can deliver Oseberg on the NYMEX crude contract at a discount of around 30 cents a barrel to the benchmark WTI.</p>
<p>WTI is a lighter crude, with an API gravity of 43.6 degrees compared to 36 degrees for Norwegian Oseberg. WTI also has a lower sulfur content, which is preferred by most refiners.</p>
<p>Oseberg was last delivered into NYMEX about three years ago, traders said.</p>
<p>ARCO's portion of Seaway is a 20-inch crude line with a capacity of around 160,000 barrels per day that runs from Texas City, Texas to Cushing, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>The seller of the Oseberg barrels was initially believed to be Norway's state oil company Den norske stats oljeselskap AS (Statoil), but the economics of bringing Oseberg across the Atlantic don't support such a transaction, traders said.</p>
