<p>The Egyptian state said on Tuesday it would offer investors a minimum 10 percent or 570,400 shares in partially privatised United Arab Spinning and Weaving/Unirab for two days from January 8, 1997.</p>
<p>Individual investors can buy a minimum 25 shares while institutions have a minimum of 5,000 shares.</p>
<p>The minimum offer price of the shares is the same as the closing price of Unirab's stock on the Egyptian stock exchange on December 30. According to the Capital Market Authority, Unirab shares closed at 62.61 pounds.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Egypt and Triple A Securities are handling the sale.</p>
<p>The government-owned Textiles Manufacturing and Trade Holding Company also said it would sell Unirab's employees another 6.1 percent or 347,944 shares, effectively shrinking its majority in the firm to 45.2 percent from 61.3 percent.</p>
<p>Private investors and funds currently own 38.7 percent.</p>
<p>Officials at the Public Enterprise ministry have listed Unirab as one of 16 companies which the state will privatise further during the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Unirab's profits for distribution rose to 32.56 million pounds in the financial year 1995/96, up from 28.76 million in the previous year, a company statement said.</p>
<p>The years end on June 30.</p>
<p>The firm also decided to double its capital to 11.408 million pounds by offering investors a free share for each share they own.</p>
<p>Unirab said it would give a 4.240 pound dividend for 1995/6, up from 3.015 pounds in the previous year.</p>
