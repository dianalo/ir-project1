<p>Iran seized 1,500 banned satellite dishes in a crackdown last month, a local newspaper said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tehran police chief Brigadier Reza Abolfathi told the Jomhuri Eslami daily all the illegal equipment was seized in a two-day operation.</p>
<p>Police launched the crackdown after the Voice of America (VOA) started a television programme with popular U.S.-based Iranian artists, banned in Iran as "decadent", Tehran residents said late last month.</p>
<p>They said many had taken down dishes after police entered neighbours' homes and seized satellite dishes in some districts. In other areas agents went door to door asking people if they had equipment.</p>
<p>In April 1995, Iran ordered all satellite TV equipment dismantled after banning it to fight a Western "cultural invasion". Dish owners face fines of three million rials ($1,000) and confiscation of their equipment.</p>
<p>Residents said some of the estimated 250,000 dish owners had put them back on their roofs shortly after the 1995 ban, often camouflaged as air-conditioners or other equipment.</p>
<p>Abilfathi also told the newspaper police had dismantled nine networks of "corruption and prostitution" in various parts of Tehran. Several people were arrested, he added.</p>
