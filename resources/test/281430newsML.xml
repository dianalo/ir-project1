<p>AC Milan's Yugoslav striker Dejan Savicevic said on Tuesday that he hoped to stay at AC Milan after his contract expired next summer but it depended on the Italian club and coach Arrigo Sacchi.</p>
<p>"Few players can be relaxed if the results don't come," Savicevic told Italian RAI television.</p>
<p>"As far as I am concerned, it's all the fault of the headlines of certain newspapers. Of course, if I don't figure in the plans of Sacchi's Milan I will have to leave but the contract does not expire until June," he said.</p>
<p>"There is still time for agreement. I hope to stay at Milan," said the 30-year-old who joined the club in 1992.</p>
<p>The Yugoslav daily newspaper Pobjeda on Monday quoted Savicevic saying that he had still not decided where to continue his career "but that the most favourable option at the moment is a move to Manchester United next autumn."</p>
<p>The player told RAI on Tuesday that he had received "some offers, but not from Manchester."</p>
<p>Savicevic was the inspiration behind Milan's 4-0 thrashing of Barcelona in the 1994 European Cup final.</p>
