<p>An awe-inspiring display of power and precision earned Pete Sampras his fourth Wimbledon title on Sunday when he crushed Frenchman Cedric Pioline 6-4 6-2 6-4 in one hour 34 minutes.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old world number one, winner here from 1993 to 1995, lost only a handful of points against his own thumping serve and pressured Pioline's deliveries, with inch-perfect returns.</p>
<p>Pioline, 28, and the first Frenchman to reach the Wimbledon singles final since Yvon Petra in 1946, was forced into a string of volley errors by the sheer power of the American's ground strokes.</p>
<p>The 44th-ranked Frenchman, watched by his wife Mireille on her first visit to London, did produce some delicate touches -- an exquisite lob and several passes down the line -- but he was no match for Sampras.</p>
<p>Sampras, a consummate grasscourt player who dropped his serve just twice in seven matches at the championships, broke Pioline's serve once in the first set, twice in the second and once in the third. There was never any question who was in charge.</p>
<p>It was the American's 10th grand slam win. He needs two more to equal Australian Roy Emerson's grand slam record.</p>
