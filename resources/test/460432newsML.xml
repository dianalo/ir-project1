<p>Finnish shares ended their four-day losing streak on Friday, buoyed by firmer bonds and gains on Wall Street, but brokers saw the recent shaky tone prevailing at least until the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy meeting next week.</p>
<p>The HEX general share index rose 1.4 percent to 2,838.34, but fell 4.1 percent for the week.</p>
<p>The FOX portfolio and derivatives benchmark advanced 1.7 percent to 991.48, but shed 4.3 percent over the week.</p>
<p>Telecoms blue-chip Nokia outperformed, rising 1.6 percent to 305.70 markka. Trade in Nokia accounted for 35 percent of turnover, which at 500 million markka was quiet for a Friday.</p>
<p>Investors, scared by this week's mounting uncertainty about the start of EMU and by talk that a U.S. interest rate hike may be imminent, remained cautious and the rise in share prices was mainly a recoil to losses earlier this week, operators said.</p>
<p>"This was not necessarily a start of a new rise, it may be a natural correction after a four-day slide," one broker said.</p>
<p>Sport goods and tobacco group Amer outperformed, ignoring the Liggett case in the United States, brokers said, noting that tobacco accounts for just eight percent of Amer's net sales. Amer rose 4.00 markka, as many percent, to 104.00 markka.</p>
<p>Among forestries, UPM-Kymmene recovered some of this week's losses closing 3.00 markka higher at 107.50. In the finance sector, Merita advanced 0.30 markka to 17.20.</p>
