<p>PRAVO - Vseobecna Zdravotni Pojistovna now has 7.675 million policyholders, an increase of 888,000 clients, said Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus. The reason given for the increase was the recent decrease in the number of insurance agencies.</p>
<p>- The government approved a plan submitted by Minister of Trade and Industry, Vladimir Dlouhy, to restructure Aero Vodochody. A strategic partner for the aviation company should be selected by the end of this year.</p>
<p>- The government wants to help improve the situation with small domestic banks through a programme which would purchase bad loans from the banks using the newly formed Czech Financial Institute. The condition would be beginning an individual stabilisation programme.</p>
<p>- Pavel Tykac, the general manager of Motoinvest, a dominant shareholder in Agrobanka, said he saw indications that the Czech National Bank seems to have decided to decrease Agrobanka's basic capital, depreciating the shares of current shareholders and essentially nationalising the bank.</p>
<p>- Mortgage rates have increased substantially since this summer. The reason is the Czech National Bank's July anti- inflationary measures concerning the entire banking sector.</p>
<p>- Neither Tatra nor Skoda Liaz will fulfil their ambitious plans to increase lorry production. Skoda Liaz decreased their planned output to 1,352 lorries from the original 2,200. Tatra cut their estimates from 3,000 to more than 2,000.</p>

<p>- The new passenger hall in Prague's Ruzyne airport, which will increase capacity to 4.8 million passengers a year, is expected to open in June, 1997.</p>
