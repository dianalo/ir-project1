<p>Australian Communications Minister Richard Alston said on Thursday he had underestimated the number of job losses in the state of Tasmania that would flow from partial privatisation of telecoms group Telstra Corp.</p>
<p>"The overall position for the 1996/97 financial year is that the total percentage of planned staff reductions in Tasmania is of the order of eight percent of the total number of Telstra staff employed in the state at the end of 1995/96," Alston told the Senate, the upper house of parliament.  </p>
<p>He had previously told the Senate that fewer than two percent of Tasmanian Telstra jobs would become redundant if Telstra steamlined its operations, as planned in the privatisation scheme.</p>
<p>The government needs the vote of Tasmanian Independent Senator Brian Harradine for parliamentary authorisation of its planned sale of a third of Telstra.</p>
<p>Harradine has not said how he will vote, although he has said he is concerned by possible job losses.</p>
<p>The government does not control the Senate and needs two extra votes to get legislation through the upper house.  </p>
<p>Since the Labor opposition and the Australian Democrats and Greens minor parties all oppose the sale, the government must pin its hopes on the two Independents, Harradine and Labor defector Mal Colston.</p>
<p>The sale is expected to raise about A$8 billion.</p>
