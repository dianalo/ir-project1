<p>Cypriot Finance Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou on Tuesday said a new government package of measures were under consideration to support the island's fledgling stock exchange.</p>
<p>"It is our conviction that the exchange will score even better achievements in the coming future because it is among our intentions to introduce additional incentives and to take additional measures which will contribute to the increase of investment activity," said the minister, addressing the opening ceremony of the trading floor of the Cyprus Stock Exchange (CSE).</p>
<p>The CSE started operating in March 1996, replacing years of unofficial over-the-counter transactions held under the auspices of the Cyprus Chamber of Commerce and Industry.</p>
<p>"The development of the exchange and its contribution to the economic development of our island has been satisfactory," Christodoulou said.</p>
<p>The government recently announced plans to reduce corporate tax by five percentage points to encourage listings by new companies on the bourse, which now trades in 89 securities of 43 listed companies.</p>
<p>Corporate tax rates in Cyprus now stand at 20 percent on net income below 40,000 pounds ($77,000) and 25 percent above that figure.</p>
<p>The CSE moved its trading floor to a new building in the centre of capital Nicosia last month, from its temporary location in the chamber of commerce. The new location also houses the administration offices of the bourse.</p>
<p>It holds 90 minute trading sessions daily. Tuesday's trading session was opened by Christodoulou after the floor was blessed by a Greek Orthodox bishop.</p>
<p>The market capitalisation of the bourse rose 7.56 percent in June to 1.163 billion pounds from 1.081 billion in May. The volume of daily transactions averaged 839,000 pounds per session in June.</p>
<p>The bourse is now working on fully computerised trading to allow paperless settlement by early 1998. Settlement is set at trade-date-plus-nine (T+9).</p>
<p>"It is our intention to continuously upgrade, modernise and harmonise the CSE to European and international standards as part of the drive to consolidate our country's position as a regional financial centre," said CSE chairman Dinos Papadopoulos.</p>
<p>The island's central bank gave an additional listing incentive this year when it issued approval for offshore firms to list on the bourse, provided CSE listing requirements are met.</p>
<p>Transactions in the shares of offshores, which must be public companies, will be available to non-residents in foreign currencies.</p>
<p>Nearly 28,000 firms have registered on an offshore basis in Cyprus since 1975. ($= 0.516 pounds)</p>
