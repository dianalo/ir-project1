<p>AIRBAGS OPERATING AT LOW SPEEDS</p>
<p>National insurer, the N-R-M-A, says airbags are unnecessarily activated in low speed crashes in a number of vehicles.</p>
<p>Tests by the N-R-M-A on 27 vehicles found airbags activated in seven cases, at speeds of 15 kilometres an hour.</p>
<p>Industry Research Manager, Robert McDonald, says airbags should not be activated at such low speeds.</p>
<p>Mr McDonald says the activation of airbags adds four-thousand dollars to the repair cost of the vehicles.</p>

<p>TREATY REFUSAL AN OMINOUS SIGN, SAYS YUNUPINGU</p>
<p>Aboriginal leader Gallarwuy Yunupingu says the federal government would sign the European Union's trade treaty if it really intended to represent all Australians.</p>
<p>Mr Yunupingu, the chairman of the Northern Land Council, says the government's refusal to sign a human rights clause means it must be planning to affect the rights of indigenous and ethnic Australians.</p>
<p>The Land Council has prepared a report for the EU detailing Australia's human rights record towards Aborigines.</p>
<p>Mr Yunupingu says it will look bad internationally if Australia doesn't sign the treaty.</p>

<p>FORMER SALVO FACES SEX CHARGES</p>
<p>A former Salvation Army Officer has appeared in the Perth Magistrate's Court charged with 77 sex offences.</p>
<p>Charles Allan Smith was extradited from Tasmania earlier this week to face the charges which date between 1958 and 1976.</p>
<p>The charges include indecent dealings with children under the age of 14 and gross indecency.</p>
<p>Mr Smith was not required to plead to the charges and he was granted 10-thousand dollars bail to appear in court again in a fortnight.</p>
<p>However, it's understood Mr Smith will remain in custody because he's unable to obtain a surety for his bail.</p>

<p>TORRENTIAL RAIN THREATENS NSW WITH MORE FLOODS</p>
<p>In north-west New South Wales, State Emergency Services have gone on alert following torrential rain.</p>
<p>A watch is being kept on the Peel River, which flows through the city of Tamworth, after falls of up to 100 millimetres in the region.</p>
<p>The railway line near Murrurundi has been washed out and many minor roads have already been cut.</p>
<p>The Weather Buearu has also issued a minor to moderate flood warning for the Namoi River at Wee Waa and warned of severe thunderstorms for parts of the region this afternoon.</p>

<p>WORD EXPECTED ON CENTURY ZINC FUTURE</p>
<p>Crucial talks are taking place in the north west Queensland city of Mount Isa, on whether the world's biggest zinc deposit, Century Zinc, should be mined.</p>
<p>Aboriginal groups are still talking with mining company CRA, which is offering a 60-million dollar package if the billion dollar project goes ahead.</p>
<p>If the midnight deadline for agreement passes without agreement the project goes to a six month process of arbitration.</p>
<p>That could threaten the sale of the deposit and mean the mine won't proceed.</p>
