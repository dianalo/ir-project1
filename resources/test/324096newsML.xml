<p>Mediterranean crude tanker rates soared on Wednesday for 80,000-tonne vessels on strong demand and an acute shortage of ships, while Middle East rates held steady, brokers said.</p>
<p>Cross-Med rates rose as high as W152.5 for 80,000 tonners from about W105 on Tuesday, an Italian broker said. "I don't remember a day like this in 15 years," he added.</p>
<p>"There are plenty of requirements...and it is now impossible to find ships for January and very difficult for early February," he said.</p>
<p>"The market is nervous and a bit confused."</p>
<p>He said he did not expect rates to climb much further, and although W152.5 had been achieved, the second highest fixture was much lower at W125. "I think we may have reached the maximum," he added.</p>
<p>"I think it will come down by Friday or Monday, but not to the W100/105 level of a few days ago," another broker said.</p>
<p>But 130,000 tonners cross-Med were broadly steady, with vessels fixed in the mid to low 90s, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Middle East market held at recent levels, with very large crude carriers on westward voyages steady at W52.5-55 and to Japan at W65, they added.</p>
<p>West Africa-U.S. rates were likewise little changed, with VLCCs fixed for about W62.5 and 130,000 tonners at W95-97.5.</p>
<p>In the transatlantic sector, rates for 80,000 tonne vessels firmed by 15 to 20 points to around W172.5. "The Continent market is very active and (transatlantic) Aframaxes are up as well," one broker said. But transatlantic VLCCs were steady at around W62.5, he added.</p>
<p>Another broker said that despite plenty of activity for inter-U.K./Cont 80,000 tonners, rates were flat to slightly softer at W115/117.5 as there was sufficient tonnage around.</p>
<p>Fuel oil was steady with 25,000 tonnes inter-U.K./Cont fixed at W195 and cross-Med at W190.</p>
<p>In the Caribbean, 70,000 tonners upcoast were unchanged at about W167.5, with 50,000 tonne fuel oil cargoes likewise steady at W185.</p>
