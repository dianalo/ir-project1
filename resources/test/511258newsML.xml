<p>Confidence among European Union industrial firms continued to improve in March, with a majority expecting selling prices of goods to rise in the coming months, the European Commission said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In its monthly review of economic sentiment among consumers, businesses and construction firms, the Commission found that "all industrial indicators continued to progress favourably."</p>
<p>"There is now for the first time since December 1995, a majority of European manufacturing managers who expect selling prices to augment in the coming months," the Commission said.</p>
<p>Overall, the EU's sentiment index, which combines the level of confidence across all sectors, rose to 101.3 in March from 101.1 in the prior month. In 1996 the index averaged 98.9.</p>
<p>Virtually all of the EU's 15 members posted a rise in the sentiment index. Belgium and France were the only countries showing a deterioration.</p>
<p>In France, a slight worsening in consumer expectations pulled down the total index.</p>
<p>Germany, meanwhile, showed a noticeable improvement in all three categories, with the sentiment index rising to 99.1 from 98.6.</p>
<p>The survey also found that pessimism in the construction industry has diminished, with the confidence indicator rising to its highest level since November 1995.</p>
