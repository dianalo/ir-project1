<text>
<p>Wholesale electricity prices in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) held relatively steady Monday despite lower spot natural gas prices, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Short-term natural gas prices in Texas were said to have fallen off to near $3.50 per million British thermal units on Monday, while January Henry Hub natural gas futures traded down about 25 cents to near $3.25 per mmBtu.</p>
<p>ERCOT firm, peak power for Tuesday delivery was pegged steady to higher at $30.00-32.00 from a notional assessment late last week of $29.00-31.00 for Monday delivery.</p>
<p>Off-peak non-firm ERCOT power transactions were pegged steady at $16.00-18.00, the sources said.</p>
<p>ERCOT January/February peak power prices were said to have felt the impact of lower gas prices, falling Monday to $30.00-30.50 from $31.50-32.00 late last week, the sources said.</p>
