<p>President Bill Clinton on Friday once again delayed implementation of a law that would allow U.S. citizens to sue some foreign companies doing business in Communist-ruled Cuba.</p>
<p>Clinton ordered a further six-month suspension of the controversial provision of the so-called Helms-Burton law he said "in order to consolidate and build on the momentum we have generated for democratic change in Cuba ..."</p>
<p>He said he would keep on suspending the law as long as U.S. allies, who have been angered by the law, continued efforts to promote and democracy and human rights.</p>
<p>"I would expect to continue suspending the right to file suit so long as America's friends and allies continue their stepped-up efforts to promote a transition to democracy in Cuba," Clinton said in his statement while on vacation in the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>
<p>The provision would allow U.S. citizens, including Cubans who left after Fidel Castro took power in 1959 and are now naturalized U.S. citizens, to sue foreign companies benefiting from their property seized by the Communist government.</p>
<p>The law, enacted in March, enraged Europeans, Canadians and Mexicans who argued that the United States was trying to impose its anti-Cuba trade sanctions on them. They moved to counter Helms-Burton and filed trade complaints to the World Trade Organization.</p>
<p>Clinton, seeking to calm tensions, in July suspended the lawsuit provision for six months. He appointed Undersecretary of Commerce Stuart Eizenstat as a special envoy to work with U.S. allies to find common ground in trying to bring democracy to Cuba.</p>
<p>After a flurry of diplomatic activity by Eizenstat, who traveled to Mexico, Canada and all major European capitals, members of the European Union in December agreed to press Cuba on human rights and democracy.</p>
<p>That move gave Clinton room to suspend the law for at least another six months.</p>
<p>"The United States seemed for too long to be singing solo on the need for human rights and democracy in Cuba," Eizenstat said at a State Department news conference. "Today, there is more internatinal pressure on Castro than at any time since his coming to power to initiate real democratic reforms."</p>
<p>European Commission President Jacques Santer called Clinton's decision a "constructive move" that was a "step in the right direction." But he said the European Union remained "firmly opposed to all extraterritorial legislation" and would continue to defend its interests.</p>
<p>But Cuba dismissed Clinton's move, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso in Havana saying the Helms-Burton law remained unchanged.</p>
<p>"It's a negotiating weapon so that other countries adapt their policies to those of the United States .... It's obvious that the extra-territorial nature of the law still stands," he told reporters.</p>
<p>And in Ottawa, Canada shrugged off Clinton's suspension and criticized Washington for continuing to try to influence other countries' relations with Havana.</p>
<p>"I think this decision is disappointing," International Trade Minister Art Eggleton told reporters.</p>
<p>Clinton originally objected to key parts of the law, but agreed to sign it last year after Cuban MiG jet fighters shot down two civilian aircraft flown by anti-Castro activists in February. Four Miami residents were killed.</p>
<p>The law also barred executives of foreign companies doing business with confiscated property and their families from entering the United States. That provision went into effect and has been used against executives of a Canadian mining company and a Mexican telecommunications firm.</p>
<p>Eizenstat said some 12 other firms stopped using confiscated property or shelved planned investments because of the law. The United States recently told an Israeli sugar and citrus firm it might be in violation of the U.S. law, he said.</p>
<p>Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who along with Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., authored the law, said he was "extremely disappointed" by the decision.</p>
<p>"By declaring his intention to waive this provision indefinitely, the president has given up the best leverage the United States had to pressure Canada and Mexico to change their ways," Helms said in a statement. "And he has sent a signal to Europe that they have done enough, just as they have taken their first, small steps in the right direction."</p>
