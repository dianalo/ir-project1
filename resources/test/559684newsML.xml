<p>The entrepreneurial spirit of 1990s Vietnam has come into its own outside the Hanoi People's Court, where the country's biggest-ever drugs trial entered its third day on Monday.</p>
<p>Dozens of people have lined the road outside the court since the closed-door hearing got under way on Friday, offering photocopies of newspaper stories on the scandal for 1,000 dong (8.5 U.S. cents) a sheet.</p>
<p>Public interest in the trial of 22 suspected heroin traffickers, half of whom are state police officials and border guards, has been intense.</p>
<p>The presiding judge in the case has said that more than 10 people could be sentenced to death and one of the key defendants has vowed to expose some "extremely important people".</p>
<p>Glancing nervously at police officers standing nearby, one man said he had paid 500 dong per newspaper clipping copy and expected to make a cool profit of about $1.70 a day.</p>
<p>Another asked how much he could get for copies in English, but ran off seconds later as a fellow seller was hauled away by police officers and driven off in a motorbike sidecar.</p>
