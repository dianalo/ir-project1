<p>Joe Camel, the suave dromedary who excelled at billiards, played the saxophone and tirelessly promoted RJ Reynolds Tobacco's Camel cigarettes from behind dark glasses, died Thursday at his home in North Carolina. He was 9 years old.</p>
<p>His demise was widely anticipated after years of criticism for his not-too-subtle appeal to children and his recent emergence as a target of the federal government, including President Clinton.</p>
<p>His health had deteriorated rapidly after the June 20 announcement that the tobacco industry would settle a bevy of lawsuits brought by 40 states.</p>
<p>Joe's death came at the hands of his own creators, who finally acknowledged that the mounting criticism over the years finally made them blink.</p>
<p>"We're not denying that the controversy was not part of the reason" for killing the character off, Richard Williams, a spokeman for R.J. Reynolds, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>"We took into account the issues and we have addressed them. The overriding issue our critics have raised has consistently been Joe Camel. That issue has now gone off the table," Williams said, adding, "It was time to move on."</p>
<p>Immediately after he was born in 1988, Joe's influence on sales of Camel brand cigarettes showed results.</p>
<p>Joe was known to frequent pool halls, dressed in black leather and sunglasses, looking like a tough kid. And, of course, he smoked.</p>
<p>John Banzhaf 3d, executive director of Action on Smoking and Health, a leading anti-tobacco organization, said it was clear from the beginning that Joe would be an attractive symbol to potential underage smokers.</p>
<p>Banzhaf said Joe Camel's death was evidence that the tobacco industry is ultimately susceptible to outside pressure, which has grown in intensity in recent years.</p>
<p>"It shows that right now that the toabcco industry is very, very vulnerable and that they can be pushed," he said.</p>
<p>Joe Camel's passing may result in the disappearance of many others like him, Banzhaf said.</p>
<p>He said his group would ask the Federal Trade Commission to draft a new rule permanently banning the use of cartoon characters or animals in all tobacco advertising.</p>
<p>Only hours after Joe's death was announced on Thursday, before his body was even cold, the FTC asked the company to make sure he never returns.</p>
<p>The agency asked RJ Reynolds to promise in writing never to try to bring Joe back to life.</p>
<p>Joe Camel is survived by his parent, the RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., and several other tobacco companies and their marketing mascots -- among them the Marlboro Man, his chief rival in the fiercely compeitive tobacco indstry.</p>
