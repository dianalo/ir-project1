<p>Brazil will respect its export quotas assumed with the Association of Coffee Producing Countries (ACPC), a senior government official said Monday.</p>
<p>"The reassuring news that Brazil can give is that it will respect the ACPC programs. Brazil is aligned with the ACPC countries in its common objectives," said Elisabete Serodio, cabinet chief for Brazil's Basic Products Secretariat.</p>
<p>"At the moment we do not need to to seek other paths, we will respect the commitments. We want to stabilize the market by seeking common solutions," she added, speaking at a meeting of the CEV group of Latin American coffee producers in Quito.  </p>
<p>Brazilian 1996/97 coffee output will be around 25.5 million 60-kg bags, while exports should be about 15 million bags, Serodio said.</p>
<p>Serodio was heading the Brazilian delegation attending the meeting of the CEV, which groups Central American countries, Ecuador and Venezuela.</p>
<p>High-level officials from Brazil and Colombia are also attending and hope to prepare common positions for upcoming meetings of the Association of Coffee Producing Countries and of the International Coffee Organization.</p>
<p>Serodio said Brazil will establish a Coffee Council to fix state policies for coffee production, sales and exports.</p>
<p>Brazil has coffee stocks of 3.5 million bags.</p>
