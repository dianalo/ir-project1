<p>Indian insurance industry leaders said on Thursday they wanted an end to a state monopoly, but not free access for foreign firms.</p>
<p>A day after the government buckled under opposition pressure and hastily withdrew a bill aimed at setting up an insurance regulator, businessmen said foreign firms must be restricted to minority shareholdings in private joint ventures.</p>
<p>"The insurance sector needs urgent liberalisation, but there is no doubt in my mind that Indian firms should have a majority stake in insurance joint ventures," N. Kumar, president of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), told reporters.</p>
<p>Speaking on the sidelines of an international conference on insurance, Kumar said the CII backed the recommendations of a committee that wanted foreign investors in the business, but sought extra safeguards for Indian firms.</p>
<p>The Malhotra committee, set up in 1993, had said that private entrepreneurs starting joint ventures should hold 40 percent and sell off 60 percent of equity to the public.</p>
<p>Kumar said Indian firms must hold a majority within the 40 percent of total equity held together with foreign partners.</p>
<p>Shambu Anand, general manager, insurance services at J.K. Corp Ltd, said: "It is very necessary to protect Indian interests. Foreigners must remain within specified parameters."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral withdrew an insurance regulatory bill from the lower house of parliament on Wednesday, after his coalition failed to muster enough votes to defeat an opposition-backed amendment barring the entry of foreign firms.</p>
<p>Gujral said on Wednesday that the government would reintroduce the Insurance Regulatory Authority of India Bill after consultations with various political parties.</p>
<p>The bill was seen as an initial step to pave the way for foreign companies' entry into the huge and potentially lucrative sector.</p>
<p>In 1996, Indians paid 130 billion rupees ($3.64 billion) as life insurance premiums and 69 billion rupees ($1.93 billion) as general insurance premiums to state monopolies.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry estimates annual growth rates in both businesses to be between 15 and 20 percent.</p>
<p>Anand said if there were no limits on foreign equity in a joint venture, the Indian partner might want to sell out to foreign partners within two or three years.</p>
<p>India nationalised its life insurance business in 1957, when 245 companies were merged to form the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation of India.</p>
<p>In 1973, 107 companies were nationalised under the umbrella of the General Insurance Corporation (GIC), which covered all areas of insurance except life cover.</p>
<p>Anand said India's private firms had been out of the general insurance business for only 20 years and retained the required expertise to run the business.</p>
<p>"We need nothing more than some of the systems and the products that foreign companies have."</p>
<p>Before nationalisation, India's front-ranking business families controlled leading insurance companies. The Tatas owned New India Assurance, the Birlas ran Ruby Insurance, and the Singhanias owned National Insurance Co.</p>
