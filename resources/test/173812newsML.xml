<headline>Dollar slides amid fears of G3 policy change.</headline>

<p>The dollar weakened in Europe on Thursday as fears gripped foreign exchanges that the major economies' strong-dollar policy was coming apart at the seams.</p>
<p>The dollar slid in Tokyo after Japanese finance ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara was quoted as saying the dollar's climb after last year's plunge against the yen was about to end and the ministry was not trying to weaken the yen further.</p>
<p>The comments shocked a market which had been nervously watching the United States for any post-election retreat from its commitment to a firmer currency.</p>
<p>"The (Sakakibara) remarks highlight the likelihood that the pre-election strong dollar policy was to some extent contrived. The market will now become suspicious that the U.S. attitude towards the strong dollar will be similarly relaxed," said Tim Fox, treasury economist at Standard Chartered Bank.</p>
<p>Analysts said the comments carried special resonance as they came from the man dubbed "Mr Yen" for his part in dragging the yen down from last year's post-war high against the dollar.</p>
<p>"The comfortable consensus in G3 policy towards foreign exchange -- get the dollar up -- is unravelling faster than expected," said Klaus Baader, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in London.</p>
<p>"But the initial signal did not come from the new U.S. administration as many expected but from Japan, where it appears the groundwork is being laid for a rate hike," he said.</p>
<p>The dollar slumped to 111.69 by European midsession, its weakest level since mid-October and far below Wednesday's European close of 113.95 and intraday high of 114.67.</p>
<p>It fell a pfennig from Wednesday's close to 1.5085 marks, while the mark dived to 74.07 yen from 75.11.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the G3 was not about to reverse policy and Sakakibara, director general of the finance ministry's International Finance Bureau, simply wished to cap the dollar against the yen.</p>
<p>Wednesday's data showing Japan's trade surplus shot up 22.1 percent in the first 20 days of October versus a year earlier may have spurred him into speaking out, they said.</p>
<p>"I don't think it signals a change in policy by the Japanese authorities," said DKB International economist Nick Stamenkovic.</p>
<p>"The yen's weakness has been a key part of Japanese policy to allow the economy to recover so the authorities will be very reluctant to see a reversal."</p>
<p>But it now remains to be seen whether officials in the new U.S. administration oppose the strong-dollar policy because of its potentially adverse impact on U.S. exports, analysts said.</p>
<p>However, while the U.S. and Japan may have reasons for wanting a lid on the dollar, Germany has precious little interest in a weaker dollar against the mark, analysts said.</p>
<p>A sustained shift to marks could destabilise the whole process of European monetary union and strangle the fragile German export-led recovery.</p>
<p>Germany's economic woes were highlighted by new data showing unemployment there increased a seasonally-adjusted 41,000 from September -- way beyond forecasts of a 10,000 rise.</p>
<p>With extreme fiscal austerity likely in 1997, the prospect of a domestic economic pick-up looks remote, analysts said.</p>
