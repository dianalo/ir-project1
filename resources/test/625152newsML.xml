<p>The ratio of South Korea's defaults on notes hit a 15-year high of 0.25 percent in April, the central Bank of Korea said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>"This is the highest monthly figure in the last 15 years," a central bank official told Reuters.</p>
<p>This is compared with 0.15 percent in the same month a year ago and 0.24 percent in March, the bank said in a statement.</p>
<p>The notes would include such debts as promissory notes and bank cheques.</p>
<p>It said the rise was largely due to the defaults by affiliate companies of financially troubled groups such as Hanbo, Sammi and Jinro.  </p>
<p>The central bank said 1.89 trillion won worth of notes were not honoured in April out of a total 769.4 trillion won that should have been repaid.</p>
<p>The number of defaulting companies increased to 1,318 in April, against 936 a year ago and 1,268 in March, it said.</p>
