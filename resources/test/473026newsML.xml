<p>Jittery investors kept Russian debt soft on Thursday in an otherwise very quiet emerging debt market lulled into near sleep by this week's U.S. interest rate rise and the prospect of a long weekend.</p>
<p>"There's been nothing approaching a trade in the major stuff this morning, though Russia got hit again," a European bank trader said.</p>
<p>He attributed the fall, with dollar Vneshekonombank debt dipping about 1/4 of a point, to fresh market talk that the deal on rescheduling Russia's debt would probably not be completed until at least September.</p>
<p>The deal to restructure some $32 billion in old Soviet commercial debt is all but agreed but the reconciliation process is taking longer than expected, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>Moscow has said it expected to complete the deal and turn the debt into loans by the end of the first half.</p>
<p>But one analyst said if the reconciliation process were to drag on too long, it would start to worry some investors who have bought when-and-if paper that the Vnesh debt becomes after the agreemnt is completed.</p>
<p>The "drop dead" date when when-and-if paper ceases to be valid is at the end of December.</p>
<p>"It just provides another uncertainty," one analyst said.</p>
<p>He added the costs of failing to close the agremeent this year would be huge for Russia as it would mean banks that were still holding Russian debt on their books would have that much less appetite for new paper issued by the government.</p>
<p>There are also worries about the strikes in Russia over wage arrears, though the numbers taking to the streets appear to number tens rather than hundreds of thousands.</p>
<p>One analysts said an additional factor has been selling of Vnesh by Russian investors who have been unnerved by this week's 25 point rise in U.S. interest rates.</p>
