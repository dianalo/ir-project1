<p>China and the United States must forge a new textile trade pact by Friday and no further extensions of the deadline will be made, top U.S. textile negotiator Rita Hayes said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hayes arrived in Beijing at the weekend for talks aimed at extending a bilateral textile accord and resolving a dispute involving U.S. penalties on imports of Chinese textiles.</p>
<p>The textile accord had been scheduled to expire on December 31 last year but was extended by one month to allow the two sides to hammer out differences on renewal of the 1994 deal.</p>
<p>Disagreement over textiles was not likely to lead to a cross-Pacific trade war but the Friday deadline would not be changed, Hayes said before beginning three days of talks at China's Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.</p>
<p>"The deadline is January 31 and there are no more extensions, so we have to reach agreement," she told reporters.</p>
<p>"We are in hopes that the consultations will continue the mood that they had in the previous consultations and that is that both sides are trying to get an agreement," she said.</p>
<p>Washington slapped $19 million worth of penaties on imports of Chinese textiles last September, saying Beijing was shipping textiles through third countries to evade quota restrictions.</p>
<p>China has threatened to retaliate by temporarily banning imports of some U.S. textiles, farm goods and alcoholic drinks but has delayed such action to allow time for further talks.</p>
<p>The two sides failed to reach agreement on the issue in talks in the United States last month. Washington said then it would re-examine its decision to reduce quotas for Chinese textile imports.</p>
<p>China's textile sales to the United States have long been a sensitive point for U.S. trade negotiators eager to reduce Washington's swelling trade deficit.</p>
