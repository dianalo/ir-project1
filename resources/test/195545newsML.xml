<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel, under the gun to find money to plug holes in the budget, can count on collecting a good 20 billion marks ($13.28 billion) from smokers this year, a study said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Ifo economic institute said smokers in Germany would inhale 35.6 billion marks worth of cigarettes during the year.</p>
<p>But cheaper cigarettes in neighbouring countries, along with smuggled ones, will cost Bonn about 1.9 billion marks in lost tax revenues.</p>
<p>Despite the hefty intake of funds from smokers, Ifo said the tax funds were not a way for Waigel to raise revenues to help whip Germany's finances into shape for European currency union, which is set to start in January 1999.</p>
<p>The report said German smokers would have "a strong allergic reaction" to any attempt to raise cigarette taxes, saying smokers would cut back on the habit if that happened.</p>
<p>The report said a higher cigarette tax would on average prompt each smoker to cut back by a minimum of 350 cigarettes a year.</p>
<p>The Ifo report also predicted the German cigarette market through the year 2000 should remain steady.</p>
<p>Sales in 1996 should reach 135.7 billion cigarettes but grow to only 136.7 billion cigarettes in 2000, meaning tax revenues would be steady in current dollars through 2000. ($1=1.5063 Mark)</p>
