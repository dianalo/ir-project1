<p>Japan's Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said on Wednesday he will make utmost efforts to settle the Japan-U.S. insurance dispute during ministerial talks which he and acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky will hold on Saturday.</p>
<p>He said that differences still remained in the bilateral dispute over the deregulation of Japan's insurance market.</p>
<p>Asked about newspaper reports that Japan had suggested liberalising premiums for auto and fire insurance in 1998, Mitsuzuka said Japan made proposals to deregulate its primary sector based on policies outlined in Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's "Big Bang" financial reform plan.</p>
<p>He declined to elaborate further.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka said the Liberal Democratic Party and two parties that have formed a loose policy alliance with the government are in the final stages of deciding the size and content of a supplementary budget for this fiscal year.</p>
<p>He added that drafting a supplementary budget and a full-year budget will start after an extraordinary session of parliament ends on December 18. He added that thanks to measures taken by the government, Japan's economy will be able to absorb the shock of a rise in the sales tax in April 1997.</p>
