<p>Bernard Tapie, bankrupt former tycoon, French politician and soccer boss, was to spend his first night in jail on Monday, his lawyer said -- the first of many if the Supreme Court rejects his appeal on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"He is going (to prison)," Tapie's lawyer Jean-Yves Lienard told reporters after the ex-cabinet minister spent the weekend pondering last-ditch ways of avoiding going behind bars.</p>
<p>By law, Tapie, who has expressed terror at the prospect of going to jail, must report to prison on the eve of the hearing on his appeal against an eight-month sentence for rigging a soccer match. Otherwise his case would be scrapped.</p>
<p>But he still had a few possible legal emergency exits and television crews mounting guard outside Paris's La Sante prison were kept guessing all day whether he would actually come.</p>
<p>Lienard earlier visited the central Paris jail to discuss the conditions of his client's incarceration.</p>
<p>"I wanted to discuss with the prison administration the manner in which he would be admitted to La Sante if he decided to come," the lawyer said, adding with a grin: "He won't come unless they give it a fresh coat of paint."</p>
<p>French news media said Tapie, 54, had inquired whether he would be allowed to use his portable telephone in prison -- the answer was 'no' -- and how many showers a day he would be allowed.</p>
<p>He was also reported to have called Loik Le Floch Prigent, the former chairman of state railways and of oil giant Elf Aquitaine, recently released from six months in pre-trial detention, to inquire about conditions at La Sante.</p>
<p>VIPs in La Sante include guerrilla mastermind "Carlos".</p>
<p>The Supreme Court will rule on Tuesday on Tapie's final appeal against an eight-month sentence for bribing players to fix a soccer match between Marseille and Valenciennes in 1993.</p>
<p>If the court upholds the sentence, he will stay in jail and serve the rest of his term. If it quashes his conviction, then Tapie, whose business empire once included sports equipment giant Adidas, will walk free until a re-trial.</p>
<p>He faces a blizzard of other legal actions over his failed holding company, tax affairs and stewardship of Marseille.</p>
<p>He could avoid imprisonment for several more weeks if he abandoned the appeal to the Supreme Court. Simply not turning up at the jail would annul the court hearing.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in Paris, where Tapie lives, would then have to determine how and when he served the sentence.</p>
<p>Tapie, who has begun a career as a film actor, is hoping for an open prison regime under which he could spend only his nights in jail while working as an actor during the day.</p>
<p>Justice sources doubted that the Supreme Court would put off Tuesday's ruling because of lingering doubts about whether he was still protected from imprisonment by his membership of the European Parliament, his last political mandate.</p>
