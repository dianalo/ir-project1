<p>Iraq, Kuwait and some of Kuwait's allies on Wednesday held their first meeting since the latest Iraq crisis to discuss the fate of some 600 people missing since the 1990-91 Gulf crisis.</p>
<p>"The meeting started under the auspices of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)," U.N. spokesman Saleem Fahmawi told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>He said officials from Iraq, Kuwait, the United States, France, Britain and Saudi Arabia took part.</p>
<p>A standoff between Washington and Baghdad began on August 31 when Iraqi troops got involved in Kurdish factional fighting in northern Iraq -- closed to Baghdad for the last five years. The United States retaliated by firing missiles at Iraqi targets and ordering a military buildup.</p>
<p>Wednesday's talks in a technical committee, one in a series of ICRC-arranged meetings, convened on the Kuwaiti side of the border with Iraq at a camp of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observer Mission (UNIKOM). UNIKOM provides the meeting place as a neutral party.</p>
<p>Accounting for the missing, who include Kuwaitis and other nationals, is among U.N. demands to ease sanctions imposed against Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>An official Iraqi newspaper said on Sunday an Iraqi human rights body had set up a committee to trace missing Kuwaitis. Iraq has said it freed all those captured during the crisis but promised to continue to look into the issue.</p>
