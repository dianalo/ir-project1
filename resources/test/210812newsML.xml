<p>The European Union formally asked the Western European Union on Friday to provide support for an eventual humanitarian aid effort in Africa's troubled Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>A formal decision was needed for the EU's fledgling defence arm to act and was taken without further discussion at a meeting of EU development ministers in Brussels.</p>
<p>Earlier this week foreign and defence ministers from the 10-nation defence grouping said the WEU would act if asked to do so, envisaging transport and logistical support.</p>
<p>Whether it actually goes to the Great Lakes region will depend on whether a military planning meeting in the German city of Stuttgart decides to send a force.</p>
<p>Late on Thursday Canadian foreign minister Lloyd Axworthy -- whose country would lead the force -- said no decisions were expected to be taken.</p>
<p>The decision has been thrown into doubt after the voluntary return to Rwanda of 500,000 of the estimated 1.2 million refugees in eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>The WEU links 10 EU members -- all but Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Ireland and Finland. It has said it is also willing to give financial help to African nations that were helping in the Rwanda crisis.</p>
<p>EU development ministers said at a regular meeting on Friday priority should be given to the return of the refugees towards their country of origin and helping Rwanda create the essential conditions for the return of the Rwandan refugees.</p>
<p>The ministers asked the WEU "to elaborate and implement the specific aspects of the EU's action which have defence implications".</p>
