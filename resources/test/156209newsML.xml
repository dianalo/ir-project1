<p>Canadian Environment Minister Sergio Marchi said on Thursday he hoped that parliament would vote next week on a bill to ban the gasoline addictive MMT.</p>
<p>"It's still very much a priority," said Marchi told Reuters after a news conference.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation, which would ban the sale and imports of the widely used octane-enhancer has reached the final debate stage in the House of Commons, the lower chamber of Canada's parliament.  </p>
<p>Marchi said the government was determined to pass the bill. If it survived a House of Commons vote, the bill would then go to the Senate for final approval.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation has pitted two of Canada's most powerful lobbies against each other.</p>
<p>The auto industry supports the MMT ban, claiming the additive gums up auto emission diagnostic systems.</p>
<p>But the oil industry says the bill is a needless piece of legislation that will cost it tens of millions of dollars.  </p>
<p>Last month, Richmond, Va.-based Ethyl Corp threatened Canada government with a US$201 million lawsuit under the North American Free Trade Agreement over the proposed MMT legislation. Ethyl's Ethyl Canada unit is the only importer and manufacturer of MMT in Canada.</p>
<p>Environment and health groups said that MMT, because of its key ingredient, manganese, was a potential neuro-toxin that might hurt brain development.</p>
<p>MMT, methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl, has been used as a replacement for lead in gasoline in Canada for 19 years.</p>
<p>In late 1995, the controversial additive was allowed for use in the United States after the U.S. Court of Appeals overruled Environmental Protection Agency objections to it.</p>
