<p>The leader of a student revolt that toppled communism in Albania six years ago warned on Friday of a return of authoritarianism and called on students to wake up to prevent it happening.</p>
<p>Azem Hajdari, a hero of the December 1990 revolution who fell out with the ruling Democratic Party he helped found, said he had to speak out to remind young people in Albania of the ideals they fought for.</p>
<p>"If you do not rise from your slumbers, we will build what our fathers built," the biggest daily Koha Jone quoted Hajdari as saying, in a reference to more than 45 years of communist dictatorship.</p>
<p>He said he intended to stage a rally outside the headquarters of state-run television later on Friday to demand the resignation of its general director, accused by Hajdari of sanctioning biased reporting.</p>
<p>Hajdari refused to attend a celebration of the party's sixth birthday in a pyramid-shaped building in central Tirana originally built as a museum for late dictator Enver Hoxha. Instead, he spent the afternoon with students.</p>
<p>Students in Tirana recently sent a petition to the government, calling for better accommodation, higher scholarship grants and the erection of a monument to freedom on their campus. Students in the southern town of Gjirokaster have made similar demands.</p>
<p>A power blackout six years ago infuriated students, sparking the first street protests which led to the collapse of one-party rule.</p>
