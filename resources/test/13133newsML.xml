<text>
<p>Talks on a political solution to the conflict in Chechnya, due to resume in the village of Novye Atagi on Sunday morning, have been delayed.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said the delay was because rebels had violated a ceasefire agreement. But Chechen rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov said Russian Security chief Alexander Lebed was getting advice by telephone from Moscow.  </p>
<p>The meeting between Lebed and the Chechen rebel chief-of-staff was due to have begun at 10 am (0600 gmt). But almost three hours later it had not started.</p>
<p>Rebel spokesman Movladi Udugov told reporters in Novye Atagi, 20 km (12 miles) south of Grozny, that Lebed, who spent the night at the Russian military base of Khakala near the Chechen capital, was on the telephone to Moscow.</p>
<p>"Lebed is now getting advice from the highest leadership in Moscow," Udugov said, implying he was talking to President Boris Yeltsin.</p>
<p>But Interfax later quoted federal military sources at Khankala as saying that the meeting had been postponed because rebels had disarmed an interior ministry armoured column in Grozny on Saturday, seizing weapons.</p>
