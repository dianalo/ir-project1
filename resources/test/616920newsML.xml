<p>U.S. Gulf gasoline surged higher Tuesday afternoon as brisk buying interst entered the region, helped news of refinery problems.</p>
<p>"Valero was buyer in the (conventional M1) gasoline today," one market player said, after the unscheduled shutdown of a 61,000 barrel per day fluid catalytic cracker at its newly acquired Houston, Texas refinery. The company said the unit should return to operation in about one week.</p>
<p>NYMEX futures slid sharply on the opening bell and managed to pare only part of the steep drop by the close. June gasoline shed 1.54 cent by the settlement and June heating oil dropped 2.25 cents.</p>
<p>U.S. GULF COAST</p>
<p>Prompt conventional M1 gasoline started the day at about 1.75 cents under the screen, but soon zoomed higher to trade at 0.75 cent under the July NYMEX futures, boosted by buying interest from Valero, as well as other refining interests.</p>
<p>However, Valero sold some conventional M2 gasoline on Tuesday, which has a higher RVP level than the M1, according to traders.</p>
<p>Reformulated A1 gasoline saw very thin activity during the day, though the prompt premium 93-octane reformulated gasoline changed hands at about 6.00 cents over the July futures, one market player said.</p>
<p>Distillate markets were more subdued than the gasoline, players said, though low sulphur diesel for early June delivery changed hands at 1.50 cents under the July futures.</p>
<p>News that Ecuador's state-run oil company was tendering to purchase 2.6 million barrels of diesel fuel for June through December delivery had little impact on the market. That purchase was related to Petroecuador's planned shut down of the 110,000 bpd Esmeraldas refinery there from mid-June to mid-August.</p>
<p>NEW YORK HARBOR</p>
<p>Gasoline values drifted lower, pressured by sharp losses in NYMEX gasoline futures and a widening spread between the June and July contracts.</p>
<p>M2 unleaded gasoline was bid at 2.40 cents under June gasoline compared with 2.35 cents under on Friday.</p>
<p>"Nobody wants to buy off June when July is two cents weaker, so people are holding off buying," said a Horbor trader. The June/July NYMEX gasoline spread settled at 2.41 cents.</p>
<p>Trading in the spot market was thin, however, following the three day weekend.</p>
<p>A2 reformulated grade was bid at 0.25 cent over the June futures and asked at 0.50 over June, slightly stronger than the 0.75 to 1.00 cent range talked on Friday.</p>
<p>"That strength is pretty typical for this time of year," said a Harbor trader, noting spring and summer is usually the period when gasoline demand peaks. Reformulated gasoline is the grade used in the U.S. Northeast.</p>
<p>MIDCONTINENT</p>
<p>The Midcontinent markets were quiet in late afternoon trade amid light demand.</p>
<p>"It has been quiet all day," said a trader in Chicago.</p>
<p>Differentials were talked steady to slightly weaker from Friday, with Group Three unleaded at about 5.00 cents over the June futures. Chicago market unleaded was pegged at 2.00/2.25 over the print.</p>
