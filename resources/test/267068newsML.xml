<p>The Thai baht edged lower against the dollar in late trade on Thursday as the U.S. unit strengthened abroad, dealers said.</p>
<p>The baht was traded at 25.595-25.598 to the dollar late against 25.587-25.592 earlier, dealer said.</p>
<p>"The dollar's rise in overseas markets made the U.S. unit stronger against the baht," said one currency dealer. "But the buying of the dollar was not so strong due to the good demand for the baht ahead of the central bank reserve requirements."  </p>
<p>All commercial banks have to meet the Bank of Thailand's reserve requirement on seventh and 22nd of every month.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand fixed the dollar/baht mid-rate unchanged at 25.55.</p>
<p>The overnight interbank rate fell to 14.00-14.50 percent late from 14.75-15.00 in early morning on higher liquidity, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The interbank rate will ease further after the passing of the reserve requirement," one dealer at a local bank said. The one-month dollar/baht swap premium rose to 11.30/11.80 satangs per dollar late from 11.00-11.75 in the morning.</p>
