<p>French industrialists expect activity to increase in all sectors in the coming months except the car sector, where business is expected to stabilise, the Bank of France's monthly survey showed.  </p>
<p>Business leaders said industrial activity had recovered in June, the BoF reported. There were significant pick-ups in consumer goods and semi-finished goods, and more moderate rises in industrial capital goods.</p>
<p>Output stabilised in agribusiness and fell slightly in the car sector.</p>
<p>Capacity use improved. Overall demand firmed both on export markets and in the domestic market, partly helped by stock-building.</p>
<p>Order books appeared to be generally satisfying. Stocks rose in consumer goods, the car sector and agribusiness.</p>
<p>"During the next few months, activity should increase in all sectors, except the car sector where it is expected to stabilise," the Bank of France said in a statement.  </p>
<p>"Prices of commodities and finished products did not change much overall," the Bank said.</p>
<p>"Some increases in the cost of supplies were seen in some semi-finished goods sectors, caused mainly by the rise in the dollar. These were not passed on into sale prices," it said.</p>
<p>Business leaders remained cautious as regards investment, and little investment spending had been undertaken.</p>
<p>Commercial activity, which had been strong in May, fell in June, partly because of the weather. It was up overall over the two-month period.</p>
<p>In building and public works, there had been a mainly seasonal recovery in the second quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>The total number of employees remained stable in industry, except for the car industry where numbers fell again. Numbers also fell in the building sector, commerce and market sector services.</p>
