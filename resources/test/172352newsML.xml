<p>Ivory Coast will meet its London Club bank creditors in Paris on November 20 for a further round of talks to solve the thorny problem of its commercial debt, Prime Minister Daniel Kablan Duncan said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Duncan told a news conference that Finance Minister N'Goran Niamien would attend the meeting.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast owes around $6.5 billion to commercial banks, mostly interest accrued since it suspended payments in 1987.</p>
<p>"I think the discussions are making progress. The finance minister will go to Paris on November 20 for discussions which we hope will prove fruitful," Duncan said, adding that the World Bank, African Development Bank and others were prepared to help solve the debt problem.</p>
<p>"I think things are ripening here and there and I think that during the November meeting we will make significant advances," he added.</p>
<p>Asked what solution Ivory Coast sought to its commercial debt problem, he replied: "Ivory Coast must be given a (debt) treatment which enables it to wipe out 75 percent of its debt."</p>
<p>Niamien said last month commercial banks proposed a debt buyback at 41 cents to the dollar as part of a restructuring package of the London Club debt while Ivory Coast made a counter proposal of 15 cents to the dollar.</p>
<p>Negotiations were suspended early in October when the two sides failed to reach common ground.</p>
<p>"Ivory Coast's commercial debt on the market today is at 22 cents," Niamien told state television at the time. "So the commercial banks estimate that the minimum to be considered in terms of negotiation is 22 cents," he said.</p>
<p>"They asked to be paid at the level of 41 cents. We have proposed 15 cents and 15 cents, really, is stretching ourselves," he said.</p>
<p>The two sides have been negotiating for two years and last met on the sidelines of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund annual assembly. A deal would enable Ivory Coast to borrow again on the commercial market.</p>
<p>The two sides are agreed on a Brady-style debt restructuring plan but they are apart on how much the Ivorians should pay back yearly, the amount of Past Due Interest (PDI) to be converted into Brady bonds and the price and proportion of the buyback portion of the package, bankers say.</p>
<p>Namien has not disclosed the latest figure for how much the banks want Ivory Coast to pay yearly but banking and official sources have put this at between 75 billion CFA and 200 billion CFA francs.</p>
<p>An official source told Reuters in July that Ivory Coast had offered at talks in Paris in June to pay 128 billion CFA in 1996 and about 11 billion CFA yearly up to 2000. Its package works out to an average yearly repayment of 21.7 billion CFA between 1997 and 2010.</p>
<p>More than half the Ivorian commercial debt is in the form of interest arrears and banking sources close to the talks said the banks want to roll just over $2 billion into Brady bonds. Ivory Coast says it can only afford $730 million, they said.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast previously signed a deal with its commercial bank creditors in 1985/86 but was unable to service this after 1987 because of diminished revenue from cocoa and coffee.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast says it is now a victim of its own economic success with creditors pressing for a harder bargain based on a rebound in its economy since 1994.</p>
