<p>Celadon Group Inc said Wednesday it expects earnings a share from continuing operations for the fiscal 1997 first quarter ended September 30 to be more than 50 percent higher than the $0.07 a share reported a year ago.</p>
<p>The company also said it sees revenues from those operations to be about 20 percent above the $39 million reported in the fiscal 1996 first quarter.  </p>
<p>"The improved first quarter perfomance is due to reduced operating expenses and a restructuring of the company," chief executive officer Stephen Russell said in a news release. "In recent months, we have reduced expenses close to $100,000 per week and have significantly improved our operating ratio. Our target is to achieve an operating ratio of under 90 percent by the April-June 1997 quarter."</p>
<p>The trucking company has refocused sales and marketing efforts toward the U.S.-Mexican market, its primary niche," Russell said.</p>
