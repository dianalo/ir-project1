<p>The trend number of New Zealand job ads fell 0.2 percent in May, and by 4.8 percent in annual terms, ANZ Bank said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The fall in job advertising over the past year, in all three main urban areas, is consistent with the subdued economic climate which has led to a fall in company profitability and weaker business confidence," the bank said.</p>
<p>Job ads in Auckland rose during May but the increase was of a smaller magnitude than in previous months.  </p>
<p>The trend number of Auckland job ads was up 0.3 percent following a 0.5 percent rise in April, and was down 1.8 percent when compared to May 1996.</p>
<p>Job ads in Wellington fell 0.4 percent in May, and were down 15.1 percent on May 1996.</p>
<p>Christchurch job ads fell 2.5 percent in May, and 12.5 percent in annual terms.</p>
