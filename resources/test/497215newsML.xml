<p>Germany's BfG Bank, a unit of ailing French bank Credit Lyonnais, on Wednesday announced that its management board chairman Paul Wieandt had retired a year ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>"The supervisory board of BfG Bank AG has agreed to Dr Paul Wieandt's request that he be allowed to retire with effect from March 31, 1997," the bank said in a brief statement.</p>
<p>The 62-year-old Wieandt, who has headed BfG for seven years, had a contract running until March 1988. He is to be replaced by his former deputy Karl-Heinz Huelsmann, aged 57.</p>
<p>Wieandt's early departure comes as little surprise after he last month declined on comment on whether he planned to stay with the bank. Banking sources say his decision to leave is linked to uncertainties about BfG's future.</p>
<p>BfG is constantly being named as one of the prime takeover targets in Germany. In recent months, speculation has abounded that it would be sold off by its French parent, forcing Wieandt to issue repeated denials that such plans existed.</p>
<p>As recently as late March, he once again insisted that the relationship between BfG and Credit Lyonnais was secure but admitted that the French bank's financial problems might force it into a sale at some stage.</p>
<p>Analysts have often questioned the advantages BfG has derived from its association with Credit Lyonnais and the German bank itself has failed to quantify the synergy effects of the relationship.</p>
<p>Wieandt worked at several German banks during his career and was credited with leading a successful restructuring at Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz, a regional state bank.</p>
<p>BfG returned to profit under his leadership following a strategic rethink of the bank's business breakdown and significant job cuts.</p>
<p>Retail banking, a division hitherto controlled by Huelsmann, is one of several areas in which BfG is now specialising.</p>
<p>BfG said its supervisory board chairman Michel Renault had praised Wieandt's efforts for the bank.</p>
