<p>Buoyed by strong increases in personal income and good job prospects, consumers bought new homes at the briskest pace in a decade during August, the Commerce Department reported Monday.</p>
<p>Sales rose 4.7 percent to a surprisingly strong seasonally adjusted annual rate of 832,000 in August, the fastest clip in more than 10 years, since hitting 857,000 a year in April 1986.</p>
<p>Both June and July rates were revised upward, with July sales up 8.3 percent to 795,000 a year instead of rising 7.9 percent to 783,000 as previously reported.</p>
<p>In a separate report, the Commerce Department said August incomes from wages, salaries and other sources rebounded 0.6 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $6.5 trillion in August.</p>
<p>Incomes had risen a scant 0.1 percent in July.</p>
<p>Analysts said the surge in August new-home sales underlined the resilience of the housing industry. But they added that the two reports remained consistent with an expected slowing in national economic activity during the third quarter, which ended Monday.</p>
<p>"The basic reason that GDP (gross domestic product) will slow so significantly in the third quarter is that personal consumption spending falls off from the second quarter," said economist David Orr of First Union Corp. in Charlotte, N.C.</p>
<p>He predicted that after booming ahead at a two-year high of 4.7 percent a year in the April-June second quarter, GDP will throttle back to a 2 percent rate of expansion in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The big surprise was the climb in sales of new homes, which had been predicted to fall back instead of advance to a 10-year peak.</p>
<p>"This housing (sector) has nine lives; it refuses to plateau," said economist Sung Won Sohn of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, speaking to reporters in a telephone conference call, claimed strong new-home sales show "the American people have tremendous confidence in what is happening with the U.S. economy."</p>
<p>Coming just five weeks before the Nov. 5 presidential election, the favourable report was seized upon by the Clinton administration as proof that its policies were on track.</p>
<p>"We see a very strong economy over the foreseeable future," Kantor said, adding that a leaner government and smaller spending deficits were contributing to keeping interest rates in check.</p>
<p>The August jump in national sales was led by a 28.9 percent increase in the Midwest, where houses sold at a rate of 196,000 a year. The last time houses in the Midwest sold more strongly was 2-1/2 years ago, in December 1993, when they were moving at a 206,000-unit rate.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the only region where August sales increased was in the South, up a modest 2.6 percent to 355,000 a year. That was the strongest rate since 381,000 in July 1995.</p>
<p>Sales in the Northeast fell sharply in August by 13.9 percent to an annual rate of 62,000 and in the West they declined 2.7 percent to 219,000 a year.</p>
<p>A vibrant economy, in its sixth year of expansion from the last recession in 1990-91, is undergirding the housing sector by making consumers more confident about taking on long-term mortgage commitments.</p>
<p>"There's hundreds of thousands of jobs being created every month, incomes are being generated and it's giving consumers the wherewithal to go out and purchase a home," said economist David Lereah of the Washington-based Mortgage Bankers Association.</p>
<p>The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said rates for a 30-year mortgage averaged 8 percent in August, down from 8.25 percent in July and 8.32 percent in June. But that was well above the average 7.03 percent rate available last January.</p>
<p>The incomes and spending report was in line with expectations, since the last employment report showing 250,000 jobs created in August also said earnings and the average workweek had increased.</p>
<p>A new employment report due Friday is forecast to show 166,000 jobs were created in September.</p>
<p>Consumer spending rose in five of the six months through August, with the only decline coming in June, when it fell 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>The August spending increase was concentrated on durable goods, including cars and other items expected to last three years, which surged 3.1 percent to an annual rate of $644 billion from $624.9 billion in July.</p>
<p>By contrast, spending on nondurable products was flat at $1.54 trillion, while spending for services gained just 0.3 percent in August to $2.99 trillion.</p>
