<p>Harvesting of South Africa's 1997 maize crop has ground to a virtual halt following continued unseasonal rains this week, raising fears that traders may have problems meeting export commitments.</p>
<p>"There is virtually nothing going on. The maize is still just standing in the fields due to all the moisture," Japie Grobler, chairman of the National Maize Producers Organisation (Nampo), told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>The harvest had already been delayed by up to a month in most areas because of late rains. Grobler said further delays might jeopardise traders' export plans.</p>
<p>"If there are no rains from now, farmers will be able to harvest in about two weeks time.</p>
<p>"But what will cause havoc for exports is if we have another rainfall in the next week," he said, adding that he believed that all the carryover from the 1996 season had already been used up.</p>
<p>South African maize traders have already exported at least 70,000 tonnes of white maize to Kenya, following a drought there, with more being loaded. Further quantities from the new harvest are also expected to find their way there.</p>
<p>"There will not be enough to load the ships," Grobler said.</p>
<p>Weather forecasters predict cloudy weather with more showers and rain on Friday, but conditions were expected to begin clearing from the weekend.</p>
<p>Although some grain had begun to be harvested in the western parts of the maize belt, Nampo said last week that the eastern Free State would not be able to bring in the bulk of the crop for several weeks.</p>
<p>South Africa's 1997 commercial maize harvest was officially estimated at 7.66 million tonnes by the National Crop Estimates committee last month, down from last year's 9.69 million.</p>
<p>A 7.66-million-tonne crop should leave over one million tonnes for export after allowing for average consumption of between six and 6.5 million tonnes.</p>
<p>This year's crop is expected to deliver 4.109 million tonnes of white maize and 3.551 million tonnes of yellow compared to 1996's 5.836 million of white and 3.858 million of yellow.</p>
