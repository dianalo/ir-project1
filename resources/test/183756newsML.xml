<p>Turkish sugar beet farmers' union Pankobirlik is to build the biggest sugar refinery in Turkey, costing about $65 million, a union official said on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>"We hope to lay foundation in spring for the refinery," said Riza Kozanoglu, deputy general manager of Pankobirlik.</p>
<p>"We have three options for the plant site and will soon determine the optimum place," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>The refinery would be near the central Turkish town of Bogazliyan, in Yozgat province, where farmers produce about 1.1 million tonnes of sugar beet annually.</p>
<p>"The plant will be able to process 9,000 tonnes of sugar beet a day," he said. "That is the largest capacity that a sugar refinery has ever had in Turkey."  </p>
<p>Sugarbeets from around the Bogazliyan area are currently taken to the nearby Kayseri refinery, run by state refineries Turkseker, after having to wait at collection centres. This delays beet deliveries and cash payments to farmers.</p>
<p>Kozanoglu said the plant, to be fully owned by Pankobirlik, would collect beets directly from farmers which he said would make it more attractive for growers.</p>
<p>It would also be involved in production of beet by-products.</p>
<p>"This is the only sugar plant that will be 100-percent-owned by a private entity," he said.</p>
<p>Turkey has 28 sugar refineries, 25 run by Turkseker and the remaining three by Pankobirlik, bought from Turkseker. But Turkseker still has small stakes in the Pankobirlik plants.</p>
<p>Kozanoglu said the union might seek foreign loans to finance the plant, which would have initial capital of 50 billion lira.</p>
<p>"If we can get foreign loans we can complete construction in 18 months, otherwise it might take longer," he said.</p>
<p>Turkey's decades-old sugar law requires all private bodies to get government permission to build a plant, which Kozanoglu said had taken two years to get.</p>
<p>Turkseker is expected to produce about 1.5 million tonnes and Pankobirlik about 300,000 tonnes of sugar in 1996/97, compared to 1.2 million tonnes and 271,000 tonnes a year ago. --Ercan Ersoy, 90-312-4462940</p>
