<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss economists issue growth "manifesto".</title>

<p>Twenty-three independent Swiss economists have issued a "manifesto" spelling out what they say are urgent measures needed to bolster the economy.</p>
<p>"Never since the 1930s have business conditions in Switzerland been as depressed as they are today," said the 33-page document, described as "hopefully useful input to a constructive national debate".</p>
<p>The study recommends structural reforms, and a continuation of the Swiss National Bank's expansive monetary policy.</p>
<p>It was published by the Institut Crea at the University of Lausanne, and was signed by 23 of the country's economists, mainly from universities around the country.</p>
<p>The economists expect Swiss growth to be "bleak" in 1997, after no growth in 1996, the sixth year of economic stagnation.</p>
<p>"Once again, the recovery is 'for the year after next'," the study said.</p>
<p>As a result, the economy "looks ominously on its way to emulate the '10-year stagnation' of the thirties," it said.</p>
<p>The Swiss unemployment rate, at a post-war high of 5.3 percent in December, was expected to continue to rise, possibly to as high as 6.0 percent.</p>
<p>The study saw the odds of an export-led recovery as low, given that "the signals coming from Germany are mixed at best."</p>
<p>At the same time, budgetary disciplines imposed on European countries by plans for European Economic and Monetary Union "hardly point to a strong recovery in Europe," it said.</p>
<p>The best option would be to adopt a package of initiatives. These included breaking up cartels, liberalising private and public sectors, deregulation or "efficient re-regulation," streamlining fiscal policy, and creating more flexibility in the jobs market, the study said.</p>
<p>If the stagnation continued, the study warned of serious consequences, including possible increased hostility towards foreigners who may be viewed to be competing for Swiss jobs.</p>
<p>At the same time, it said Swiss wages were high and did not reflect declining demand.</p>
<p>It noted increased capital goods investment may be due partly to substitution of equipment for costly labour. Switzerland may have to tolerate higher consumer price inflation in the two to three percent range to help reduce real wages in some sectors, it said.</p>
<p>At the same time the study said the government should raise value-added taxes to finance unemployment insurance.</p>
<p>It also argued Switzerland should scale back efforts to restrain spending until the economy is back on track.</p>
<p>The combined deficits of the Federal, cantonal and local governments have already been reduced to 9.5 billion francs from 15.8 billion in the period from 1993 to 1996, despite economic stagnation, the study said.</p>
<p>"Last but certainly not least, Switzerland needs to find its bearings again, which requires a positive confidence shock," the study said. -- Zurich Editorial, +41 1 631 7340</p>
