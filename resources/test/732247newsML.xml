<p>Shares in bread-maker QAF Ltd fell on Wednesday as investors tried to digest news that Indonesia's Salim Group would be injecting the much larger P.T. Indofood Sukses Makmur into the company.</p>
<p>QAF shares rallied in early morning trade to a new year high of Singapore $1.88, but quickly gave up gains to end at S$1.70, down 10 cents. Volume was an active 4.96 million shares.  </p>
<p>Analysts told Reuters that QAF shares had enjoyed a brief run-up prior to the news of the asset injection, so the selling was not unexpected, especially given the huge fund raising exercise it has proposed to buy the Indofood stake.</p>
<p>"QAF had always been a speculative play on asset injection by Salim. Now that this has been confirmed, the speculative interest is limited," said Vasu Menon, head of research at Keppel Securities.  </p>
<p>The Salim Group, headed by Indonesian tycoon Liem Sioe Liong, said Singapore-based QAF, of which it owns 70 percent, would buy a majority stake in Indonesian-listed Indofood for about S$2.75 billion.</p>
<p>The complex asset shuffling by Salim would involves QAF undertaking a five-for-one rights issue at S$1 each to raise S$2 billion to S$2.2 billion for the Indofood purchase.</p>
<p>In addition, Salim will reduce its stake in QAF to 66 percent by selling 10 percent of the enlarged QAF to Indonesian tobacco magnate Putera Sampoerna.  </p>
<p>Analsyts said that after the asset shuffling by Salim, investor attention would focus on whether QAF would end up being just a holding company for Salim's Indofood.</p>
<p>"In the short term, QAF is just going to be a holding company for a Jakarta-listed firm. The key question for QAF is whether this will be a one off deal or will Salim inject other deals into the company," said the research head of a British broking firm who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>He said if QAF remained just a holding company for Indofood, there was no reason for investors to buy QAF as they would be better off buying directly into Indofood.  </p>
<p>Holding companies usually trade at a discount to their net tangible asset (NTA) value, analysts said. QAF's NTA after the acquisition and the rights issue will rise to 56.9 cents from 42.4 cents.</p>
<p>But the downside for QAF is seen as limited as Salim controls the bulk of the company's shares.</p>
<p>Menon said the current share price should be supported by the average price of S$1.88 that Salim paid for its QAF stake.  </p>
<p>"In the short term, QAF is going to soften as speculators get out. But over the longer term, it could be positive especially if QAF gets other regional opportunities from Salim," said an investment analyst at a U.S. broking house.</p>
<p>The Salim Group said it intends to transform QAF into a regional food company. For a start, Salim is to give QAF an option to buy several noodle and flour plants in China.</p>
<p>"But these deals are not going to materialise in the short term. It would take at least a year or more as QAF needs to digest the Indofood acquisition first," said one analyst.</p>
