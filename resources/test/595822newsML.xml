<p>Equitable Resources Inc said Monday it will acquire Northeast Energy Services Co for about $77 million in cash and stock.</p>
<p>The company said the $77 million value of the deal is based on the Friday, May 16 closing price of its common shares.</p>
<p>Equitable said the purchase, which it expects to be non-dilutive to its earnings, should close before the end of July.  </p>
<p>Equitable said a portion of the financing for the deal will consist of shares purchased on the open market, as well as authorized and unissued common stock.</p>
<p>Equitable said it has 35.5 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>The company said the deal will be treated as a purchase for accounting purposes.</p>
<p>"The addition of NORESCO to our portfolio is a part of ERI's strategy to expand our geographic market position with a total energy services product line," said Fred Abrew, president and chief executive officer of Equitable.  </p>
<p>Abrew said the deal will strengthen Equitable's overall energy efficiency capabilities for customers throughout North and South America, creating a mass of public and private sector customers as well as earnings opportunities.</p>
<p>Equitable said that between the two companies, there is an estimated $350 million in awarded resource management contracts planned for fulfillment during the next three to five years with industrial, government and commercial customers.</p>
<p>As a part of Equitable, Northeast will keep its current management team and its brand name. Northeast is a Framingham, Mass.-based company.</p>
