<p>QUESTION OF THE WEEK - Ahead of March quarter GDP data in early June and the run of partial GDP data in the next two weeks economists were asked for preliminary GDP forecasts.  </p>
<p>Strong consumer demand is expected to drive GDP, with most forecasts centring on a rise of around 1.0 percent, a large rise but still well below the 1.6 percent of the March quarter 1996 that it replaces in annual calculations.</p>
<p>One percent growth would see the annual rate drop to under 2.5 percent, although that would reflect weakness in 1996 rather than 1997, economists said.</p>
<p>With preliminary data showing strong wages growth, income based GDP could also come in on the strong side, with economists saying the risks to their forecasts was on the upside. ----------------------------------------------------------------  </p>

<p>COMPANY PROFITS - After a very strong December quarter, most expect a pull back in the first quarter of 1997. Not all, however, with some expecting the improved consumer demand and special factors from the December quartert to keep profits sterong in early 1997.  </p>
<p>WAGES DATA - Final AWOTE data for the three months to February could be the most important piece of data this week, as it will provide a breakdown of the pace of growth in the public and the private sectors. The strong preliminary data was attributed in some quarters to the continuing distortions of the public sector layoffs, so it will ber interesting to see the pace of private sector growth. A weak private sector figure could reopen speculation of a rate cut, although the general feeling was that it would show a lift from the pace of the fourth quarter.  </p>
