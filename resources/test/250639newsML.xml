<p>The estimated costs of launching Britain's fifth terrestrial television station, Channel 5, have increased by 50 million pounds sterling, the Times newspaper reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The report said Channel 5's shareholders, which include media group Pearson Plc and United News &amp; Media Plc, are expected to announce that the cost of retuning television and video machines in 14 million British homes will reach at least 150 million stg. That compares with an original estimate of 60 million stg and a previously revised estimate of 100 million stg.</p>
<p>Pearson is expected to announce the fresh estimate along with its end-of-year trading statement next week, the paper said.</p>
<p>Other shareholders in the venture, whose launch has been delayed by three months to the end of March because of the retuning difficulties, include Warburg Pincus, the U.S. investment bank, and Luxembourg broadcaster CLT, the Times said.</p>
