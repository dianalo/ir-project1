<p>French luxury goods group LVMH sold a third of its stake in British brewer and longtime ally Guinness Plc on Friday in a further move to shrink the role of its drinks business and focus on exclusive brands.</p>
<p>"LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton has sold 135,081,327 shares of Guinness, equivalent to approximately seven percent of the shares outstanding, to Goldman Sachs, thereby reducing its stake to approximately 14 percent," LVMH said in a statement.</p>
<p>U.S. investment firm Goldman Sachs placed the shares on the market at 414 pence, dealers said, putting the value of the sale at 559 million sterling ($939 million), or 5.05 billion francs.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for LVMH said the sale would pay for part of the group's $2.47 billion purchase of a majority stake in U.S. duty free chain DFS concluded earlier this month.</p>
<p>She said the decision to sell part of the Guinness stake reflected a shift in LVMH's horizon. "It's a little more DFS, a little less Guinness," she said.</p>
<p>Financial analysts said the acquisition of DFS, which has 180 shops along the Pacific Rim, and the reduction of LVMH's stake in Guinness underscore the French group's strategy to focus on its most lucrative businesses.</p>
<p>"Guinness is an outstanding franchise, but the economics of the luxury business are better than those of the spirits business. The consumption of alcohol is not as robust as it once was," said analyst Cedric Magnelia at brokerage CS First Boston.</p>
<p>"LVMH is getting more and more involved in luxury goods, where the potential is much higher. You have the developing markets, particularly southeast Asia, which are growing very fast," said Cecile d'Estais at Paribas Capital Markets.</p>
<p>She said the timing for the sale was right because of the British pound's recent rise against the franc.</p>
<p>LVMH said it sold the shares for a higher price than it paid for them but would not disclose the capital gain.</p>
<p>Its shares hit a record high of 1,584 francs before slipping back to close at 1,551 francs, up 3.26 percent.</p>
<p>LVMH said it would keep the remaining 14 percent stake in Guinness and develop the business ties between the two companies, which have 15 joint ventures, including one which handles the distribution of their brands in the United States.</p>
<p>The two companies forged a commercial partnership in the 1980s and followed it up with cross-shareholdings that left Guinness with a 34 percent stake in Moet Hennessy.</p>
<p>But the alliance began to weaken as the gap between the profitability of the drinks and luxury goods industries widened.</p>
<p>The return on investment capital in the champagne business is roughly six percent, compared with 12 percent for perfume and cosmetics and 80 percent for designer luggage, Magnelia said.</p>
<p>Last year LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault put pressure on Guinness publicly to increase shareholder value.</p>
<p>Speculation had been rife that LVMH might cut its Guinness stake even though its equity of 38.5 billion francs exceeded its net debt of 21 billion francs even after LVMH had paid for DFS.</p>
<p>Analyst Marie Laure Favre-Gilly at Natwest Sellier said she expected LVMH to keep its remaining 14 percent stake in Guinness in the near future, in part to protect Guinness's share price, which slumped more than five percent to a year low of 410 pence on Friday. "But I have my doubts about the long term," she said.</p>
<p>Favre-Gilly said joint ventures can function perfectly well without corporate cross-shareholdings. "It also hinges on whether LVMH makes other acquisitions," she said.</p>
<p>Luxury firms such as Yves Saint-Laurent or Nina Ricci, owned by Elf-Aquitaine's pharmaceuticals unit Sanofi, might be tempting targets, analysts say. LVMH is also believed to be looking to acquire a prestige jeweller.</p>
