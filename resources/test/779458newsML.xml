<p>The rupee ended up against the dollar at 35.71/72 on Tuesday compared with 35.73/74 opening on the back of oversupply of dollars and poor demand, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) bought dollars from the spot and forward market but failed to weaken the rupee, they said.</p>
<p>The RBI's intervention in the spot market did not make any dent on the rupee, but its intervention in the forward section led to a sharp rise in the forward premiums, dealers said.</p>
<p>"They (the RBI) thought spot rupee would weaken through intervention in the forwards," said the chief dealer at a bank.</p>
<p>"But it worked the other way round," he said.</p>
<p>"Instead of weakening the rupee, their intervention had the effect of dictating the interest rates," the dealer said.</p>
<p>The six month annualised forward premium closed Tuesday at 4.81 percent, up from the previous close of 4.42 percent.</p>
<p>January dollars closed at 0.85/0.86 rupees compared to the opening level of 0.78/0.80 rupees, dealers said. The central bank bought dollars across wide maturities, they said.</p>
<p>"They were the only payers in the market," said a dealer, referring to payment of premiums for buying forward dollar.</p>
<p>Some dealers were critical about RBI's forward dollar intervention, saying it was confusing the market at a time when premiums were getting aligned with interest rate differentials.</p>
<p>One dealer said the RBI was experimenting and going through a learning curve.</p>
<p>"At least the phase of reluctant intervention seems to be over," said a dealer, referring to earlier perceived reluctance of the central bank to intervene for fear of adding to the domestic money supply.</p>
