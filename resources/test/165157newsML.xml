<p>Indonesia's state-owned oil company Pertamina resumed operations at its Balongan crude distillation unit (CDU) on October 25 following scheduled maintenance since October 1, a refinery source said on Monday.</p>
<p>The 125,000 barrels per day (bpd) crude unit is being reconfigured to produce more than design capacity, he said.</p>
<p>However, two of Balongan's secondary processing units remained shut for maintenance.</p>
<p>An 83,000-bpd long residue catalytic cracking unit was shut October 1 for 60 days, while a 58,000-bpd atmospheric residue cracking unit was shut at the same time for 40 days.  </p>
<p>This is the first major shutdown at the refinery in West Java since it started operations in 1994.</p>
<p>Indonesia has been buying more diesel and jet-kerosene fuel on the spot market as a result of maintenance at the Balongan refinery and an earlier shutdown of a 200,000-bpd crude unit at Cilacap refinery between early September and early October.</p>
<p>Traders said Indonesia purchased between five and six million barrels of diesel and between 1.5 and 2.0 million barrels of jet-kerosene fuel for November deliveries.  </p>
<p>The country's normal monthly diesel imports are around 2.0 million barrels and up to 1.0 million barrels of jet-kerosene fuel.</p>
<p>The refinery, which is located 195 km east of Jakarta, processes 80 percent of Duri crude and 20 percent of Minas.</p>
