<p>Mexico plans to start a hog re-population program this year to boost the number of head above the estimated 800,000 sows now under production, sources said Friday.</p>
<p>The American Soybean Association (ASA) said in a report that funding for the program will be split equally between the Federal government, state governments and hog farmers.</p>
<p>"The program calls for the Federal government, through the Agriculture Ministry, to finance one third the cost of genetically improved breeding stock," the ASA said.  </p>
<p>State governments and farmers will also provide one third each of the necessary financing.</p>
<p>No targets are set for the re-population, even though the estimate is about half the number of sows under production in the early 1980s. Hog numbers have declined consistently for the past decade.</p>
<p>But if targets to increase per capita pork consumption are to materialise with imports remaining stable, the ASA estimates another 250,000 extra sows are needed.  </p>
<p>"Consumption per capita of pork products will not decrease further and may actually rise. Consumption per capita of pork products is not precise but estimates differ between 7-9 kg per year," it said.</p>
<p>"Both estimates consider an increase of 2 kg per capita possible. In either case that that means about 250,000 extra sows are necessary to increase per capita consumption by 2 kgs," it added.</p>
<p>A source from the mexican Hog Producers' Association confirmed the re-population move, although added it had not been officially announced because of current fine tuning.  </p>
<p>One problem is the lack of financing available to farmers, with Mexican banks still not active in agribusiness in the fallout from the December 1994 devaluation and ensuing economic recession.</p>
<p>Of the few options available to hog farmers are GSM-103 lines of credit, which are available for thoese farmers who can qualify for a Mexican bank letter of credit.</p>
<p>The ASA reported several large swine producers have moved into serious expansion modes. It named Univasa, an integrated brolier and swine producer, as one company expanding "aggressively" in the central Mexican region known as "El Bajio".  </p>
