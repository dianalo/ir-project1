<p>British women will not achieve equality in wages with men for another 45 years, the country's Equal Opportunities Commission said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In a survey on pay, the commission said there is still an average pay gap of 20 percent between men and women.</p>
<p>"There can be no equality of opportunity without equality in pay," commission chairwoman Kamlesh Bahl said. "Unless significant changes are made in the way the pay gap is tackled, women face a future of continuing inequality."</p>
<p>Between 1975 and 1995 the gap in hourly pay closed by nine percent. "If this trend continues it will mean that it will be another 45 years before it disappears," it said.</p>
<p>Pay differences between men and women are particularly wide in managerial posts.</p>
<p>Women bank and building society managers earn about 36 percent less than their male colleagues and for general managers and administrators the gap is 42 percent.</p>
