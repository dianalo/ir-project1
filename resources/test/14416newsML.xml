<p>* Peso fluctuates within Central Bank-set range</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Philippine peso ended slightly higher at 26.209 to the dollar from Friday's close of 26.213 as banks tried to shift their portfolio back to peso-denominated securities after the dollar continued to fall, traders said.</p>
<p>"The market is stabilising," one trader said. The peso fell to 26.235 on Thursday on a false rumour that Defence Secretary Renato de Villa had been killed in an ambushed. The peso had recovered slightly on Friday after the rumour proved unfounded.  </p>
<p>The peso fluctuated within a narrow band, between 26.209 to 26.221, well within the range set by Central Bank. The Central Bank pegged its buying rate at 26.20 and selling rate at 26.24.</p>
<p>Oil companies were also not in the market to bid up the dollar's value.</p>
<p>A total of $113.7 million was traded in the market.</p>
<p>The parallel market was quiet with done rates hovering slightly higher than the market rates.</p>
