<p>Gold ended a shade higher on Tuesday against New York's Monday close after a session of two-way trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The price of gold dipping below US$375 levels triggered some early follow-through selling interest," said a dealer at a major bank.</p>
<p>"The gold market dropped even further on sales triggered by bearish sentiment due to a continuing rise in the U.S. and Hong Kong stock market," another bullion dealer said.</p>
<p>But downward pressure from sales also sparked a shortcovering spree, which pushed the market back to near New York's closing levels.</p>
<p>The market held at $374 per ounce, dealers said.</p>
<p>Physical gold demand emerged slightly but buyers remained wary and business was limited to dribs and drabs, gold traders said.</p>
<p>Tael gold traded at a healthy premium to spot gold with tael gold's dollar equivalent at $375.00/50 per ounce.</p>
<p>This made arbitrage between spot gold and tael gold attractive, with players taking short positions on the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society.  </p>
<p>"People were selling taels and buying spot gold," a senior gold dealer said.</p>
<p>Bullion ended at US$374.40/90 an ounce against New York's US$374.35/85 close on Monday.</p>
<p>Local gold ended HK$6 lower at HK$3,457 a tael.</p>
<p>The carryover charge at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society dropped from nil to -3.</p>
