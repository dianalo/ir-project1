<p>Japanese oil firms expect their capital investment in fiscal 1997/98, starting on April 1, to fall 1.6 percent from the current year to a combined 276.7 billion yen, a survey by an economic daily said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Nihon Keizai Shimbun survey of 14 oil firms said they expect their capital investment in 1996/97 to total a combined 281.2 billion yen, down 15.8 percent from the previous year.</p>
<p>Japan's oil industry is striving to cut costs amid tough competition brought on by last April's liberalisation of oil product imports.</p>
