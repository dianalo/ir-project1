<p>India's Industry Minister Murasoli Maran said on Friday that the government had decided to continue with the present equity structure of carmaker Maruti Udyog Ltd in which the Indian governemnt and Japan's Suzuki Motor Company hold 50 pct each.</p>
<p>"We have decided that the present position will continue," Maran said in reply to a question at a news conference.</p>
<p>"There won't be any change in the equity level," Maran said.  </p>
<p>Maran spoke as a delegation of the powerful Japan Federation of Business Organisations (Keidanren) started a week-long visit to New Delhi.</p>
<p>Analysts said Suzuki has been keen to increase its stake in Maruti, which holds a 70 percent share of the Indian car market.</p>
<p>The Japanese firm had a head start with its pioneering start in the early 1980s, when it went into partnership with the Indian government despite its socialist market policies.</p>
<p>But India permitted foreign car majors to enter the country under an economic reform programme launched in 1991, provoking Suzuki to seek increased control over its joint venture in order to brace up for competition.  </p>
<p>Corp and General Motors of the United States, France's Peugeot, and Japan's Honda and Toyota are among car firms who have entered India.</p>
<p>Indian newspapers have said that the government wants to replace Maruti Udyog's current managing director, R.C. Bhargava, who is favoured by Suzuki.</p>
<p>Maran said the question of choosing a new managing director for Maruti was not up for consideration until August. "We will take a decision before that," he said.</p>
<p>Suzuki, without specifically mentioning the issue of a higher stake, said last month that it was in talks with the Indian government on who should have the initiative in running Maruti Udyog.</p>
<p>"We need quick decision-making in the Indian automobile market to improve competitiveness, as other foreign carmakers are going to enter the Indian market," company president Osamu Suzuki said in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Suzuki said in a full-page advertisement in the Economic Times, India's leading business daily, on Friday that it wanted to increase its hold on Maruti.  </p>
<p>"To prevail in the severe business climate, Suzuki, a holder of 50 percent of Maruti stock, believes that Maruti will be further strengthened by adding to the professional and business expertise in the management," it said.</p>
<p>Maruti Udyog has set a production target of 320,000 vehicles and exports of 30,000 for 1996/97 (April-March). It reported a net profit of 4.09 billion rupees ($114.2 million) for 1995/96 compared to 2.48 billion in the previous year.
