<title>ROMANIA: Turnover on Romania OTC market up.</title>
<headline>Turnover on Romania OTC market up.</headline>
<dateline>BUCHAREST 1997-01-10</dateline>
<text>
<p>Turnover on the Romanian over-the-counter (OTC) market was 2.03 trillion lei in the first week of trading in 1997, up from a weekly average of around 700 million last month, data by the RASDAQ trading system said.</p>
<p>A RASDAQ report on Friday put total OTC listings at 1,616.</p>
<p>The RASDAQ, which opened last October with six stocks and a first-week turnover of 9.0 million lei, is expected ultimately to trade shares in some 5,000 companies.</p>
<p>Under rules, companies privatised under the mass selloff have to sign up with the Romanian shareholders' registry (RRA) -- created to accommodate these companies -- and then get an OTC listing. ($1=4,238 lei)</p>
