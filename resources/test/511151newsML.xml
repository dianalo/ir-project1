<p>European Union fisheries ministers on Tuesday agreed by majority vote to cut fishing by up to 30 percent over five years in a bid to save endangered stocks, officials said.</p>
<p>Britain, which had insisted that the problem of Spanish and Dutch "quota-hoppers" be tackled first, voted against -- as did France, which had called for a 15 percent reduction over three years.</p>
<p>"We are not prepared to continue to see a situation where over a quarter of the British fishing fleet is foreign-owned and foreign-controlled," British Fisheries Minister Tony Baldry told reporters after the vote.</p>
<p>Fisheries is one of the few areas where the EU sets national quotas, he noted, stressing: "UK fish must be for UK fishermen."</p>
<p>He added:"The UK can well meet that (30 percent) target by eliminating quota-hoppers from our register, and that we are determined to do."</p>
<p>Quota-hopping is the practice whereby foreign trawlermen have legally set up flag-of-convenience operations in England to buy licences that give them access to British fishing quotas.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major, seeking fishermen's votes in his campaign for the May 1 election, said on Monday he would veto the EU's key inter-governmental conference (IGC) in Amsterdam in June unless the bloc reformed its fishing policies. Major's Conservatives are trailing in the opinion polls.</p>
<p>EU officials said Tuesday's deal, which was reached after Swedish concern over a Baltic cod fishing cutback was resolved, would free up hundreds of millions of dollars of aid to restructure Europe's fishing industry.</p>
<p>The cuts of up to 30 percent cover a five-year period to the end of 2001.</p>
<p>The EU's executive Commission originally proposed a 40 percent reduction over six years but this was fiercely rejected by EU member states, fearful of the political backlash if poor fishing communities were thrown out of work.</p>
<p>EU governments won greater flexibility in choosing whether to cut fish catches by laying up vessels, or by reducing fishing time at sea -- or a combination of both.</p>
<p>Stocks which are overfished, rather than endangered, are subject to a 20 percent reduction by the end of 2001.</p>
<p>Small vessels of less than 12 metres (39 feet) in length, instead of 10 metres (33 feet) in a Dutch EU presidency compromise plan, will be exempted from the cutbacks after pressure from Sweden and other fishing countries.</p>
