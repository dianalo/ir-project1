<p>Better-than-expected cocoa grind figures from western Europe's main processing centres in the second quarter point to buoyant, if not soaring demand, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>"It's certainly more positive than expected and bearing in mind the growth in origin processing, you have to conclude that consumption is not bad shape at all," one industry analyst said.</p>
<p>The grind, a key indicator of cocoa demand from the chocolate industry, rose strongly in the Netherlands, the largest bean processor in the world, and dipped only slightly in Germany and the UK.</p>
<p>The Dutch figure surged more than 10 percent to 100,132 tonnes from the same year-ago period. The latest total almost matched the first quarter's strong 102,338 tonnes.</p>
<p>The second quarter is traditionally weaker than the first ahead of slackening chocolate sales during Europe's summer.</p>
<p>"Demand (for cocoa products) is not as bad as some people would have you believe. Europe may be flat, but on a worldwide basis it's pretty good," one Dutch industry source said.</p>
<p>"Getting new business is always difficult, but what we have already is steady enough," he added.</p>
<p>The Dutch total is even more positive after taking into account the switch by one processor, Bensdorp Cocoa, away from grinding beans to handling cocoa liquor. But the two main ones, ADM Zaan, owned by Archer Daniels Midland and Cargill's General Cocoa plant were both running at full capacity.</p>
<p>Sources said there was still an oversupply of cocoa butter, a typical situation for the time of year, but that demand for powder was good. They added butter offtake should have recovered by the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Germany's second quarter total was perhaps the most surprising of Europe's big three, falling 3.5 percent to 57,402 tonnes against expectations that it could plunge by up to 10 percent, hit by capacity shifts and flat sales of tablet chocolate.</p>
<p>But analysts said the figures revealed that sales volumes were reasonably strong.</p>
<p>"You hear a lot of complaints about the state of the market in Germany. But I think that could be more to do with margins than outright sales. There's little doubt margins are tight but it looks as though sales are okay," an analyst commented.</p>
<p>Traders in Germany said the figures were in line with higher January/March 1997 German cocoa imports which at 84,725 tonnes were up from 69,593 a year earlier.</p>
<p>They also tied in with the recent announcement from export body German Sweets, which noted German confectionary exports would rise further in 1997 due to higher sales to Russia and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>In the UK, the figure -- falling 4.1 percent to 42,702 tonnes -- was pretty much as expected and showed that the Mars' Selby plant had not been active during the second quarter.</p>
