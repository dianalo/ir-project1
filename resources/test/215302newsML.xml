<p>The Bank of Israel announced MOnday that it would not lower interest rates in December, disappointing financial markets but not surprising economists.</p>
<p>Economists said they had expected real interest rates to remain high over the next few months.</p>
<p>After the Tel Aviv stock market closed, the Bank of Israel said its key lending rate in December would remain at the present level of an annualized 15.2 percent.</p>
<p>The central bank, concerned with inflation, says it cannot ease monetary policy until the government makes a substantial effort to tighten fiscal policy.</p>
<p>Parliament has until Dec. 31 to pass the 1997 budget.</p>
