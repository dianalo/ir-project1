<p>Digital Equipment Corp and Cylink Corp received permission from U.S. Commerce Department to export products containing 56-bit encryption features without incorporating "key recovery," the companies said on Monday.</p>
<p>On January 31, the Commerce Department told Reuters that under a new policy, it had granted three applications to export 56-bit programs -- more powerful coding software than had been allowed out of the country under a previous 40-bit limit.  </p>
<p>Trusted Information Systems said Friday it also received approval to export 56-bit products. Commerce officials said only one application remains under consideration, and International Business Machines Corp has said it submitted an application.</p>
<p>Encryption programs scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software "key." The strength of the encryption depends largely on the length of the keys, measured in the smallest unit of computer data, bits.</p>
<p>The approvals came just days after a graduate student cracked 40-bit encryption in under four hours.  </p>
<p>Using a network of powerful computer workstations at the University of California, Ian Goldberg easily cracked a message encrypted with a 40-bit long key.</p>
<p>"The same workstations would require more than 20 years to break 56-bit," Samuel Fuller, Digital's chief scientist, said in a statement.</p>
<p>To get permission to export 56-bit programs, the companies agreed to offer within two years programs incorporating "key recovery," which allows the government to decode encrypted messages by recovering the keys.  </p>
<p>"Within days of the Clinton administration's December announcement, Cylink's team of scientists and enginners developed what the government termed as the most comprehensive plan" to comply with the new export requirements, he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Cylink said its key recovery proposal was designed to address government and law enforcement concerns over encrypted data and provided an alternative for businesses that want to be able to recover data encryption keys.</p>
<p>The company said its key recovery mechanism, CyKey, was optional and may be turned on or off depending on business needs and government regulations. It can enable a customer to be its own key recovery agent or to select a third party.</p>
