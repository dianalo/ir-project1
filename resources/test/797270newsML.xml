<p>King Hussein of Jordan and Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held talks at the Jordanian port of Aqaba on Wednesday on the crisis in Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking.</p>
<p>Jordan said the king would press Netanyahu to ease punitive sanctions imposed on Palestinian territories after two suicide bombers killed 14 people in Jerusalem last month.</p>
<p>But Netanyahu, in his first meeting with an Arab leader since the attack, was expected to repeat demands that Palestinian President Yasser Arafat first crush militants who killed scores of Israelis in suicide bombings since 1994.</p>
<p>"Naturally the peace process will be the most important issue, given the crisis we are in," Israel's ambassador to Jordan Oded Eran told reporters before Netanyahu's arrival.</p>
<p>Netanyahu was met at Aqaba airport by Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul-Salam al-Majali and a full bedouin guard of honour before being driven to the king's palace.</p>
<p>Jordan's Foreign Minister Fayez al-Tarawnah has critiised some Israeli measures against the Palestinians as unjustified and one move -- blocking customs revenues to the Palestinian Authority -- he called "totally illegal".</p>
<p>"We want and are interested in cancelling those measures which won't be necessary when -- we hope -- the Palestinian Authority fulfils its commitments," said Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, who was accompanying Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994 but King Hussein has grown increasingly critical of Netanyahu and last month expressed despair and bewilderment at his actions.</p>
<p>The Jordan summit comes after Washington described a mission by a U.S. envoy to restore security cooperation between Israel and the PLO as encouraging.</p>
<p>U.S. mediator Dennis Ross has shuttled between Netanyahu and Arafat since Sunday, managing to bring Israeli and Palestinian security officials together for intelligence sharing.</p>
<p>But the Palestinian side links security cooperation with political progress in peacemaking and demands a halt to Israeli settlement building in the West Bank.</p>
<p>Ross said he believed Israel would ease its closure of the West Bank and Gaza Strip once security cooperation resumed.</p>
<p>"I think that as security cooperation goes forward I believe that in fact you'll see an easing of the measures," he told the Cable News Network (CNN) in an interview in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Ross was expected to meet again with Arafat and Netanyahu on Wednesday before heading home to prepare a possible first visit to the region by Albright later this month.</p>
<p>Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath said Ross had extended his visit to Wednesday in order to persuade Israel to lift the closure imposed after the bomb attack on July 30 and to rescind other measures.</p>
<p>But Palestinians said U.S. mediation had been undermined by the temporary closure of the PLO's Washington office. The office's permit expired on Tuesday night after Congress failed to pass its annual foreign aid bill before summer recess.</p>
<p>"It's a seriously wrong decision at this particular time when Ross is here trying to revive the peace process," senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said.</p>
<p>Talks on expanding Palestinian self-rule set out in a 1993 interim peace accord with Israel have been been dormant since March when Netanyahu's government allowed construction to begin of a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The twin suicide bombing plunged their already precarious ties deeper into crisis. Netanyahu accused Arafat of tacitly condoning militants who oppose the Israel-PLO peace moves.</p>
<p>Arafat has insisted he is making a "100 percent effort" on security and accuses Israel of using the bombing as a pretext to weaken his legitimacy.</p>
<p>On Wednesday Israeli workers tore down five illegal Arab homes under construction in East Jerusalem, which Palestinians hope to establish as the capital of a future state.</p>
<p>Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed it in a move that failed to win international recognition. Palestinians accuse Israel of trying to drive them out of Jerusalem.</p>
