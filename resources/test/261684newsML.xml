<p>U.N. Security Council members on Tuesday approved a $610 million award to Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) for the cost of extinguishing fires in 800 oil wells set alight during the Gulf War, U.N. officials said.</p>
<p>The Governing Council of the U.N. Compensation Commission agreed with a judges' report which had recommended the remaining $337 million claimed by KOC should be assessed later separately.</p>
<p>A small amount, $3 million, which represented the regular salary of KOC's own firefighting team, was rejected.</p>
<p>A subsidiary of state-owned Kuwait Petroleum Corporation, KOC filed a $950 million claim against Iraq in July 1993.</p>
<p>The "well-blow out claim" was the first corporate claim approved by the Geneva-based body set up by the Security Council in 1991 to compensate damages caused during Iraq's invasion and seven-month occupation of Kuwait from August 1990-February 1991.</p>
<p>"It has been approved. The result is $610 million," Carlos Alzamora, executive secretary of the Geneva-based fund, said.</p>
<p>"It was a very symbolic case for Kuwait," Alzamora told a news conference. "KOC had to put out those fires which was an unprecedented experience for the world and the oil industry to have some 600 wells burning simultaneously."</p>
<p>Alzamora, citing the fund's chronic money shortage and commitment to pay individual claimants first, added: "If we had the money and freedom to pay we would pay $610 million tonight."</p>
<p>KOC alleged that Iraqi troops, fleeing a Western coalition led by the United States, had detonated 800 oil wellheads. Some 27 firefighting teams from 10 countries, including Kuwait and the United States, took months to extinguish the fires.</p>
<p>A panel of three international arbitrators, named by the fund in March 1995, assessed the claim which was given priority.</p>
<p>The UNCC's Governing Council, comprising representatives of the Security Council's 15 member-states, adopted the panel report at a formal meeting. Earlier, Egypt and France raised some technical issues at the closed-door talks, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Dr. Adel Asem, deputy chairman of Kuwait's Public Authority for assessment of compensation for damages resulting from the Iraqi aggression, addressed the start of the meeting on Monday.</p>
<p>"We hope that other oil sector claims will be reviewed in the near future, as the losses suffered by Kuwait's oil resources and industries, which are the main governmental productions, were among the most notorious and injurious of all losses suffered as a result of the Iraqi aggression," Asem said.</p>
<p>Iraq has denied responsibility for the oil-well fires, saying that the fires were caused by allied bombing.</p>
<p>A summary of the judges' report, obtained by Reuters, said:</p>
<p>"Based on the evidence and testimony presented, the panel finds that, although part of the damage for which compensation is being sought in the well blow-out claim may be a result of the allied bombing, the bulk of the oil-well fires were directly caused by the explosives placed on the wellheads and detonated by Iraqi armed forces.</p>
<p>"The evidence referred to by Iraq is consistent with this conclusion," it said. Under previous UNCC decisions, "Iraq's liability includes any loss suffered as a result of military operations by either side.</p>
<p>"Iraq's contention that the allied air raids broke the chain of causation therefore cannot be held," the judges said.</p>
<p>UNCC's share of revenues from the oil-for-food deal should allow it to begin paying out $142 million to 56,000 individual claimants from 63 countries by March, according to Alzamora.</p>
<p>These claimants, forced to flee Kuwait or Iraq or who could prove losses of up to $100,000, will each get $2,500 for now.</p>
<p>The UNCC has received 2.6 million claims worth $220 billion from individuals, firms, and governments for losses allegedly caused by Iraq. Its funding has been precarious.</p>
<p>Under the six-month renewable deal, the UNCC is to receive 30 per cent of oil revenues -- or about $100 million a month.</p>
<p>To date, it has only been able to pay out $13.4 million in awards to 4,000 priority claimants for death of a close relative or serious personal injury.</p>
