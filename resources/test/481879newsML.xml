<p>Bayer Corp, the U.S. unit of German chemical and drugs company Bayer AG, will invest $9 billion from 1995 to 2000, with $5 billion to come from 1998 on, the unit's president and chief executive said Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The executive, Helge Wehmeier, said in a telephone interview with reporters that the spending would include $4.6 billion in capital expenditure over the 1995-2000 period. Of that amount, $3.4 billion will be spent from 1997 through 2000.</p>
<p>Bayer's U.S. unit will spend $2.96 billion on research and development from 1997 through 2000, out of a total of $4.1 billion earmarked from 1995 to 2000.</p>
<p>"We wanted to show here the faith and the kind of money that is being put behind our faith in the North American market," Wehmeier said.  </p>
<p>He said the company's goal was to increase its share of worldwide Bayer sales to 30 percent of the total from 25 percent last year. Last year's U.S. net sales totaled $9 billion.</p>
<p>Bayer plans to add another 1,700 employees because of the expansion, mostly in sales, he said. The unit has about 24,000 U.S. workers.</p>
<p>Bayer has budgeted $1.2 billion for expansion of its Baytown, Texas, chemical manufacturing complex to expand production capacities for polyurethane raw materials, polycarbonate resin and other chemicals.  </p>
<p>The capital expenditure for Baytown includes $280 million for polyurethane systems and $500 million for infrastructure and other raw materials for its isocyanates manufacturing lines.</p>
<p>The investment will make Baytown the biggest plant in the world for diphenyl methylene diisocyanate, a raw material for polyurethane, Wehmeier said.</p>
<p>The Baytown plant has about 1,300 employees, and the expansion will mean the hiring of another 400 workers. In addition, the investment will require about 3,000 construction workers at the height of the expansion early in 1998.</p>
<p>Bayer has earmarked $3.2 billion in life science investment for the period 1995 to 2000 out of its $4.1 billion research and development budget.</p>
<p>Among other spending, Bayer is investing more than $850 in its pharmaceuticals operations, with expansion in Berkeley, Calif.; West Haven, Conn.; and Clayton, N.C.</p>
<p>Capital expenditures for its agricultural division total more than $330 million. They include an upgrade of animal health production operations in Shawnee, Kan.</p>
