<p>Ex-prime minister, Esko Aho, chairman of the Centre Party, said on Friday that personal relations between himself and Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen, the SDP chairman, were not an obstacle to an SDP-Centre government.</p>
<p>"Quite often, I confront the allegation that the poor relations between Aho and Lipponen or the incompatibility of our personal chemistries constitute an obstacle to red-green cooperation," Aho wrote in a column in daily Turun Sanomat.</p>
<p>"These kind of explanations are just empty talk," he said.</p>
<p>Sixteen years will have passed by the time of the next general election in March 1999 since the social democrats and the Centre Party last sat down at the same table for government talks, Aho noted. The last time these two parties were in the same coalition was 1983-87.</p>
<p>Aho said the subsquent period without red-green cooperation had been long enough and that the country might not survive unless it was revived.</p>
<p>"Mass-unemployment persists and there are no foundations for the promises to halve unemployment," Aho said.</p>
<p>"The new parliament which will be elected slightly more than two years from now will inherit another quickly worsening problem, the social and regional division of society," he added.</p>
<p>Aho said that until 1999, the Centre Party would not engage in any such short-sighted political tactics that could exclude the possibility of cooperation betwen his party and the social democrats after the March 1999 election.</p>
