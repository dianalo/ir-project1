<p>Danish share prices closed lower on Thursday, hit by profit-taking, with dealers foreseeing more falls ahead due to the currently weaker stock and bond markets in the United States.</p>
<p>"A weak Wall Street for both shares and bonds seems to point inevitably to more falls here tomorrow," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index closed 1.25 point down at 158.53, while the KFX March future fell 2.70 point to 156.40 with 342 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>Profit-taking hit banks, Tele Danmark and Carlsberg worst.  </p>
<p>Tele Danmark shed five crowns to close at 351, Carlsberg B six to finish at 400 crowns, while main banks Den Danske and Unidanmark both dropped four crowns to end the day at 603 and 358 respectively.</p>
<p>East Asiatic fell seven crowns to 152 on a 1996 result showing a 59 percent improved pre-tax profit, while Novo Nordisk put on 25 crowns to close at 705. Sophus Berendsen continued to fall on a disappointing 1996 result for its British Rentokil unit, finishing 33 crowns down at 805. Overall turnover for the day was 1.509 billion crowns. --Chris Follett, Copenhagen newsroom +45-33969652</p>
