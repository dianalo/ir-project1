<headline>Text of Pope's medical bulletin.</headline>
<dateline>VATICAN CITY 1996-10-08</dateline>
<text>
<p>The following is the Vatican's English translation of the medical bulletin issued after Pope John Paul's appendix surgery on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The bulletin was signed by a six-strong medical team including chief surgeon Francesco Crucitti and the Pope's personal physician, Renato Buzzonetti.</p>
<p>"According to the schedule previously communicated on September 14, this morning, October 8, 1996, the Holy Father underwent - under a general anaesthesia - the surgical procedure of an appendectomy, previous to which there was a lysis (dissolving) of localised adhesions.</p>
<p>The operation confirmed the clinical diagnosis of recurring episodes of inflammation of the appendix as previously stated.</p>
<p>The extemporaneous histological examination showed a transmural appendicitis with evidence of fibrosis established from preceding inflammatory episodes. The morphological finding is indicative of recidivist appendicitis.</p>
<p>The exam will be completed with the usual definitive histopathological research.</p>
<p>The operation began at 7:50 a.m. and ended at 8:40 a.m. and was undergone well by the patient.</p>
<p>The vital signs: cardio-circulatory, respiratory, hematological and metabolical stayed with the norm for the entire duration of the operation.</p>
<p>Consciousness was rapidly recovered.</p>
<p>Immediately following the surgery, the Holy Father was taken back to his room...</p>
<p>The next up-dating on the post-operative period of the Holy Father will be given through press communiques, the first of which will be made public Wednesday, October 9, at 12 noon (1000 GMT)."</p>
