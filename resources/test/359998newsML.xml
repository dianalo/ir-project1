<p>Ukraine's top Chernobyl negotiator said on Thursday that Kiev had abandoned plans to construct a new cover over the ruined reactor at the plant and would instead strengthen the existing metal and concrete tomb.</p>
<p>"We decided that there was no need to build another shelter. There will be no second sarcophagus. We must stabilise the existing one," Environment Minister Yuri Kostenko said in an interview ahead of talks with representatives of the Group of Seven industrialised countries in Washington on February 10-11.</p>
<p>He said Ukraine would propose a three-stage plan to deal with the sarcophagus at the Washington meeting.</p>
<p>The metal and concrete shelter, thrown together by thousands of workers around Chernobyl's ruined fourth reactor, has developed cracks, spawning fears that radiation could leak into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The reactor exploded in 1986, sending clouds of radiation across much of Europe in what is still the world's worst nuclear accident. Hundreds of thousands of people were forced to leave their homes and Ukrainian officials say more than 4,000 deaths can be directly attributed to the blast.</p>
<p>The West wants Ukraine to close the plant, but experts have long debated how to fund expensive efforts to replace the tomb.</p>
<p>Kostenko said Ukraine was no longer considering several proposals to build a new shelter, including one put forth by a Franco-British alliance led by Generale des Eaux subsidiary Campenon Bernard SGE and one by German engineering firm Trischler and Partners.</p>
<p>G7 industrial nations have promised $3.1 billion in loans and grants in return for a Ukrainian promise to close Chernobyl by 2000.</p>
<p>Kiev's official stand has been it wants grants to fund the construction of a new sarcophagus rather than loans.</p>
<p>Kostenko said the first part of Ukraine's new plan would involve inserting meters inside the sarcophagus to check radiation levels and installing emergency systems to prevent possible nuclear chain reactions.</p>
<p>"We don't know clearly what is going on in there. We have no clear picture," he said, referring to the nearly 200-tonne nuclear fuel and concrete mixture in the ruined reactor.</p>
<p>He said the first stage would last five years and would also include construction of transport links to the ruined reactor, costing between $350 million and $400 million.</p>
<p>The next stage would last 15 years at a cost of $750 million, and envisage the use of special robots inside the tomb and the construction of facilities to store nuclear fuel and radioactive materials within the 30 km (16 mile) exclusion zone around the stricken plant.</p>
<p>"We still have no such facilities to keep these materials," said Kostenko.</p>
<p>The final 30-year stage, Kostenko said, would cost "several billion dollars" to remove nuclear fuel dismantle the reactor.</p>
<p>"If we do not remove nuclear fuel from the sarcophagus we cannot solve the problem of Chernobyl's safety. We have proved this to the G7. Now this problem is dominating the talks and is the main priority," Kostenko said.</p>
