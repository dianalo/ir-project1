<p>------------------ PRESS RELEASE ----------------------</p>
<p>CUPERTINO, Calif., Oct. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Apple Computer, Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) today announced results for its fourth fiscal quarter ended Sept. 27, 1996. For the quarter, Apple's revenues were $2.321 billion, a decrease of $682 million from the fourth quarter a year ago, but a sequential increase of $142 million from the quarter ended June 30, 1996. Unit shipments for the quarter were approximately 932,000, a decline of 26 percent from the year ago quarter but a sequential increase of 11 percent from the June 1996 quarter. International revenues represented 47 percent of the quarterly total.</p>
<p>Net income for the quarter was $25 million, or $.20 per share, compared with $60 million, or $.48 a share, in the same quarter a year ago. The Company's operating income for the quarter was $34 million, a sequential improvement of $150 million from its $116 million operating loss in the June 1996 quarter. Included in the fourth quarter's operating results was an adjustment of prior period restructuring charges which reduced pre-tax operating expenses by $28 million. Without this adjustment, net earnings would have been approximately $8 million, or $.06 per share.</p>
<p>The Company experienced continued sequential growth in gross margins and reductions in operating expenses. Gross margins were 22 percent, compared to 18.5 percent in the June quarter, while operating expenses before the restructuring adjustment declined to $505 million from $519 million in the June quarter.</p>
<p>"We continue to make progress in strengthening Apple's financial condition, as our $410 million in positive cash flow from operations during the quarter suggests," said Apple Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Fred D. Anderson. "We've reduced inventories by nearly $400 million since June and completed the quarter with over $1.7 billion in cash and short-term investments. Gross margins increased due to several factors, including declining component costs, improved manufacturing efficiencies, and sales of previously reserved inventory. We achieved further sequential reductions in operating expenses, primarily in general and administrative functions."</p>
<p>"By increasing revenues sequentially and fortifying Apple's financial position in each of the last two quarters, we have achieved two very critical goals of Apple's transformation," said Apple Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Gilbert F. Amelio. "We remain confident about reaching sustainable profitability by the end of Q2'97. As we move forward, our challenges will be to extend our competitive leadership in key markets and to reclaim the mantle of industry pioneer and innovator.</p>
<p>"The question before us is not 'Will Apple survive?'," said Dr. Amelio, "but rather, 'How will Apple establish leadership in the emerging digital era of the Internet and multimedia?' We plan to do so with strong management, a relentless dedication to quality, and a passionate commitment to our role as industry innovator."</p>
<p>For the Company's fiscal year ended Sept. 27, 1996, revenues were $9.833 billion, an 11 percent decrease from the prior year. The net loss for the year was $816 million, or a loss of $6.59 per share, compared with net income of $424 million or $3.45 per share in fiscal 1995. The largest contributors to the fiscal 1996 loss during the year were after-tax inventory writedowns of $388 million in the second quarter, net restructuring charges of $113 million during the year, and after-tax warranty and related expenses that were approximately $126 million greater than historical rates would suggest.</p>
<p>For the year, international revenues accounted for 52 percent of Apple's net sales, compared to 48 percent in fiscal 1995.</p>
<p>Except for the historical information contained herein, the statements regarding establishing competitive leadership, effecting innovation, addressing quality issues, introducing new products, continuing focus on certain industry growth areas, and the timing of execution of the Company's business plans are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.
