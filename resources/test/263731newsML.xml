<headline>Russian shares quiet as brokers ride out year-end.</headline>

<p>Leading Russian shares changed little on Wednesday as local brokers raced to close their year-end books and Western buyers stayed away, traders said.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System of 24 shares edged down nearly 0.348 percent to 184.35 on $8.11 million in volume.</p>
<p>"Western participation in the market is seen less and less, and only Russian reshuffling remains," said Mikhail Khaleyev, chief trader at Alfa-Capital. "Current prices are unlikely to be seriously raised or pushed down."</p>
<p>Bobby Meshoyrer, director of sales and trading at IK Aton, said some share prices sank as regional brokers with old orders took fright at investors' unwillingness to buy.</p>
<p>He forecast a slow market until mid-January and then a strong rise later.</p>
<p>Samaraenergo rose to $0.34 from $0.30 at Monday's close when it was last traded, Rostelekom rose to $2.30 from $2.27 at Tuesday's close, Lenenergo fell to $0.350 from $0.387 and UES was $0.0829 after $0.0825.</p>
