<p>MIM Holdings Ltd said on Friday it will cut ore production at its Mount Isa 1100 copper mine to 3.6 million from 4.4 million a year as part of processing improvements ahead of the start-up of the new Ernest Henry and Enterprise mines.  </p>
<p>Mount Isa Mines executive general manager Stephen O'Donnell said current feed levels to the copper concentrator would be maintained by using the convertor slag stockpile.</p>
<p>The slag, a by-product of smelting which has been stockpiled over the past two years, has a higher copper content and lower processing costs than the 1100 copper mine's ore, he said.</p>
<p>"As the slag stockpile is depleted throughput will be supplemented by the Ernest Henry concentrate from September 1997, and Enterprise Mine production, which is due to come on stream in the third quarter of 1999," MIM said in a statement.  </p>
<p>MIM said the copper smelter was expected to increase anode production from mid-1998 and reach expanded capacity of 250,000 tonnes a year by late 1999.</p>
<p>Any excess concentrate would be sold on world markets, it said.</p>
<p>The Ernest Henry copper-gold mine, 51 percent owned and managed by MIM and 49 percent owned by Savage Resources, is expected to produce 95,000 tonnes of copper and 120,000 ounces of gold a year at full production.  </p>
<p>The Enterprise mine is being developed beneath the current mine at Mount Isa, enabling total output from the Mount Isa copper mines to be maintained at the equivalent of 170,000 tonnes of contained metal, MIM said.</p>
