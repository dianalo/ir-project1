<title>USA: West Point cadet acquitted at rape court-martial.</title>
<headline>West Point cadet acquitted at rape court-martial.</headline>

<p>A West Point cadet accused of raping a woman classmate was found not guilty on Friday by an all-male jury of seven senior army officers at the U.S. Military Academy.</p>
<p>Cadet James Engelbrecht, 22, a senior from Conroe, Texas, had been accused of raping the woman at the home of another cadet in Stockholm, New Jersey, during a Memorial Day weekend party in 1996.</p>
<p>After the verdict a relieved Engelbrecht, who had faced possible life imprisonment, hugged his mother and father. "My man, I told you from the first day," Paul Engelbrecht told his son.</p>
<p>The mother of the cadet who brought the charge cried as she and her three daughters pushed their way through a group of cadets celebrating around Engelbrecht.</p>
<p>"We expected this in a man's world," she said.</p>
<p>Engelbrecht was the first West Point cadet charged with the rape of a female cadet since women were admitted to the prestigious military academy two decades ago.</p>
<p>The jury took about five hours to reach the verdict in the small West Point courtroom, which had been the focus of a constant stream of visiting cadets during the four-day trial.</p>
<p>Engelbrecht disputed the woman's testimony that she was raped, saying she had been the aggressor in a consensual sex encounter.</p>
<p>But in his closing argument on Friday, prosecuting attorney Capt. Dean Raab said the 20-year-old woman had no reason to make up her story.</p>
<p>Witnesses testified earlier the alleged victim was drunk on the night in question and Raab asked: "Does it make sense that someone in that condition would suddenly turn into a sexually aggressive predator in the middle of the night?"</p>
<p>Engelbrecht's attorney James Fitzgerald said in closing arguments that the woman had lied to investigators and kept changing her story. He said she claimed memory lapses when confronted with inconsistencies.</p>
<p>"The fact that she did not remember what she was doing doesn't excuse her. It was consensual," Fitzgerald said.</p>
<p>The woman testified she had been drinking at the time but had not consented to sex with Engelbrecht. An Army doctor confirmed the woman's testimony that she had never had sexual intercourse before the incident. He also said he had not seen any bruises on her.</p>
<p>She is now on leave from the military academy.</p>
