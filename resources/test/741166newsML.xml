<p>Hurricane Danny intensified over the warm waters of Alabama's Mobile Bay Saturday, as high winds and torrential rains from the storm pummeled the nearby coastline for hours.</p>
<p>After drifting out of the Gulf of Mexico in predawn hours, Danny stalled about 30 miles southeast of the city of Mobile. At 10 a.m. CDT, the National Weather Service said sustained winds had increased to 80 mph from 75 mph.</p>
<p>Hurricane warnings remained in effect from Gulfport, Mississippi, to Apalachicola, Florida.</p>
<p>Still a minimal hurricane, Danny was expected to be downgraded quickly to tropical-storm status as it moved inland. It also remained small in stature as well as in strength, with maximum winds extending only 25 miles from its centre.</p>
<p>Because of the storm's stationary position, however, punishing winds and rain pounded the southern Alabama coastline for hours amid unconfirmed reports of funnel clouds. Tornado watches were in effect for the Florida Panhandle, southern Alabama and southwestern Georgia.</p>
<p>"This is a very unusual situation," said Bill Williams, a private meteorologist in Mobile. "These types of storms usually move on through. But I expect this one to take all day. It's bizarre."</p>
<p>High winds downed 50 to 100 oak trees on the picturesque grounds of the antebellum Grand Hotel Resort in Point Clear, Alabama that juts out from the eastern shore of Mobile Bay.</p>
<p>In Gulf Shores, winds downed a four-storey condominium that was under construction and tore the roof off a Denny's restaurant. Eyewitnesses said waves were breaking over the town's seawall as the storm flung debris into the streets.</p>
<p>Despite minimal sustained hurricane winds, gusts of more than 100 mph and rainfall in excess of 21 inches were recorded on Dauphin Island south of Mobile.</p>
<p>"It's dumped a tremendous amount of rain on us," Baldwin County Emergency Management spokeswoman Leigh Anne Ryals said.</p>
<p>Danny briefly came ashore on Friday in Louisiana, between Grand Isle and the mouth of the Mississippi River, before moving back into the Gulf on a lumbering northeasterly track.</p>
<p>Police initially attributed two deaths to hurricane's approach Friday. But emergency management officials later said the heart-attack of an elderly man who was securing his boat in Pirate's Cove, Alabama, was not storm related.</p>
<p>Near Fort Morgan, Alabama, a local beach patrol discovered the only storm fatality -- a man who died in his swamped sailboat that had broken up in heavy waves.</p>
<p>A state of emergency remained in effect for southern Alabama. But officials said inland shelters were hardly filled.</p>
