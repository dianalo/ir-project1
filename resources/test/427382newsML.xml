<p>Turkish security forces have killed five Kurdish guerrillas in clashes in the southeast of the country, the emergency rule governor's office said on Friday.</p>
<p>In a statement, it said five Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels were killed on Wednesday in Bingol province. It did not refer to any military casualties.</p>
<p>Turkish army helicopters on Thursday launched an offensive against rebel positions in the mountainous eastern province of Tunceli, security officials said. No casualties were reported so far.</p>
<p>Fighting in the rugged countryside of the mainly Kurdish eastern and southeastern provinces often increases in March when snow begins to melt. The rebels abducted a civilian at a roadblock on a main artery through the mountains earlier this week, officials said.</p>
<p>More than 21,000 people have died in the PKK's 12-year-old armed struggle with the military for self-rule in southeast Turkey.</p>
