<title>FRANCE: LME aluminium prices too low - Pechiney.</title>
<headline>LME aluminium prices too low - Pechiney.</headline>

<p>The head of the aluminium division of Pechiney said on Wednesday that current alumimium prices on the London Metal Exchange were too low as they failed to reflect favourable prospects for demand.</p>
<p>"Today aluminium prices on the LME are abnormally low when compared to my appreciation of the industry's fundamentals," Bernard Legrand told Reuters at the annual meeting of the French Minerals, Industrial Minerals and Non-Ferrous Metals Association (FMM).  </p>
<p>A late morning setback in LME copper prices pushed the aluminium market to a fresh 2-1/2 year-low of $1,324.</p>
<p>Legrand said he did not understand the current pessimism over prospects for the aluminium market, noting world stocks were stable and there were signs that demand was picking up.</p>
<p>"Demand was low in early 1996 but it has improved. Prospects for demand are rather favourable. I do not say they are great but they are favourable. For 1996 I would predict at best an overall (supply/demand) balance," he said.</p>
<p>He also forecast a balanced market situation for 1997, with possible tightness at the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Legrand said the U.S economy was doing fine and the situation in Japan and Germany was improving. France's economic environment is "not great but not a disaster either," he said.</p>
<p>In the distribution sector, stocks were low and orders were coming in, he said.</p>
