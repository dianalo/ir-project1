<p>News of Union Bank's merger plans sent the Estonian share market into a frenzy on Monday with most bank stocks gaining and activity high, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Tallinn stock exchange index leapt 6.53 percent to 177.78 and official list trade reached 50.8 million kroons.</p>
<p>Union Bank earlier announced that it was to merge with fifth largest bank North Estonian Bank to create what will be the second largest commercial bank in Estonia.</p>
<p>Union Bank rose to 48.5 kroons from 34.09 kroons on trade of 27.6 million kroons. It was also boosted by a report that the combined bank's 1997 profit would be 140 million kroons.</p>
<p>The bank later denied the report and said the forecast would only be made in February. It earlier announced that its 1996 profit was 57 million kroons.</p>
<p>"The new merged bank would increase its slice of the financial markets and its clients will be more confident about the bank," Hansapank analyst Katrin Kaarli said.</p>
<p>Other banks also gained, with Hansapank turning over 12.5 million kroons to close 5.30 kroons higher at 167 and Savings Bank up half a kroon to 76.50 on four million kroons of trade.</p>
