<title>ARMENIA: Breakaway Karabakh leader named Armenian PM.</title>

<p>Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan on Thursday named the leader of Azerbaijan's breakaway Nagorno-Karabakh region, Robert Kocharyan, as Armenia's new prime minister.</p>
<p>Ter-Petrosyan's decree gave no explanation for the step. It is likely to infuriate Azerbaijan, which is seeking to recover Karabakh, an Armenian-populated region which effectively broke away in late 1980s, sparking years of bitter conflict.</p>
<p>No early reaction from Azerbajian was available.</p>
<p>Kocharyan, 43, one of the toughest of Karabakh's pro-independence leaders, spearheaded the separatist movement in 1988. Already effectively in charge, he won an unrecognised presidential election in Nagorno-Karabakh last year.</p>
<p>Thousands of people were killed in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Karabakh. Armenia unofficially but openly backed its ethnic kin in Karabakh.</p>
<p>It was the first of many violent ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union which helped hasten its disintegration.</p>
<p>Azerbaijan insists that Armenia used the local separatists merely as a cover for its attempts to annexe the territory.</p>
<p>Armenia has so far insisted it was not formally involved in the conflict though was fully sympathetic to the separatists.</p>
<p>Talks between Azerbaijan and Armenia, launched after a ceasefire in 1994 and aimed at finding a lasting political solution to the Karabakh problem, have stalled with both parties refusing to compromise so far despite international mediation.</p>
<p>Rivalry in the South Caucasus between the Orthodox Christian Armenians and Moslem Azeris stretches back centuries.</p>
