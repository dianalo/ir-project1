<p>U.S. Treasuries were stronger in London on Monday as steady demand supported the market, leaving it set to build-on recent gains, traders said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the main focus was on supply, with the U.S. auctioning shorter-dated paper at the start of the week.</p>
<p>"It's looking well bid out there, going into this auction," said a trader at a U.S. bank in London. "I can't see much that will shake that."</p>
<p>The U.S. 30-year long bond was at 100-20 by 1020 GMT, yielding 6.451 percent, compared with 100-19 in Tokyo and 100-16 at the New York close.</p>
<p>December T-bond futures were unchanged at 114-30 in automated trade.</p>
<p>Traders said losses on the long-bond on Friday were not indicative of the general tone in the market, and were a reflection of profit-taking ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>"Demand is still good," said the U.S. trader. "The long-end was just a bit sluggish on Friday."</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury was expected to auction $28.0 billion of three- and six-month paper later in Monday's session, followed by $18.25 billion of two-year notes on Tuesday and $12.5 billion of five-year notes on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Analysts said concerns surrounding the Federal Open Market Committee meeting last week had overshadowed previous auctions. With that threat removed, the path was clear for strong demand for the paper.</p>
<p>"The twos will be reasonably well-bid," said Peter Frank, senior economist at Sumitomo Finance in London. "There's nothing dramatic coming to disturb the positive tone."</p>
<p>He said he expected the bullish momentum in the market to continue in the short-term.</p>
<p>December T-bonds set a high of 115-15 on Friday, the highest level since late February.</p>
