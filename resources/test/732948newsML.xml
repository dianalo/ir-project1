<p>Bid fever surrounding one of Italy's largest banks Banco Ambrosiano Veneto, sending its shares soaring, cooled on Wednesday when its chairman Giovanni Bazoli said he was not concerned about takeover rumours.</p>
<p>Ambroveneto shares had been temporarily suspended both on Monday and Tuesday on the Milan bourse at the limit-up 10 percent level, and were up nearly 10 percent higher on Wednesday before Bazoli made his comments.</p>
<p>"I don't see any possibility for an action like this because our share control syndicate gives members first rights of purchase and would therefore put an end to any such hypothesis," he told reporters when asked about talk of a possible bid.</p>
<p>The shares were up 9.78 percent in early Wednesday business on the Milan bourse, but slumped on Bazoli's comments to close down 0.71 percent at 8,000 lire. Wednesday's record high of 8,065 lire compared to the 3,545 lire low seen in early January.</p>
<p>A shareholders syndicate, which includes French bank Credit Agricole, owns 69.5 percent of Ambroveneto shares and effectively controls the banking group. Therefore, a bid was seen as very difficult without the backing of the syndicate.</p>
<p>Bazoli confirmed that a syndicate member Italian savings bank Cassa di Risparmio di Verona (CariVerona) had decided to sell its 12.5 percent stake in Ambroveneto, but he said the syndicate would decide on the future of the CariVerona stake.</p>
<p>Analysts said the strong buying of the shares had little to do with fundamentals of the bank, and although Ambroveneto was well-managed the shares were now "grossly overvalued".</p>
<p>Ambroveneto is planning a merger with Milan-based savings bank Cariplo to create Italy's second largest banking group in terms of assets, and Cariplo has said it would be interested in buying CariVerona's stake to help cemment the link but there was no suggestion of a price for the share stake.</p>
<p>The share price rise has come at a time when the group faces restructuring after the Cariplo merger, and has said it plans to boost its capital by up to 6.8 trillion lire ($3.9 billion) over the next five years as part of the takeover process. ($1=1,745 lire</p>
