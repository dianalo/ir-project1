<p>The Italian government released funds on Monday to help rebuild Turin cathedral and an adjoining palace which were devasted by fire at the weekend but experts said the site could never be restored fully.</p>
<p>Investigators in the northern Italian city of Turin probed claims that guards in the royal palace, which has been converted into a museum, alerted the fire brigade more than half an hour after the alarm bells sounded late on Friday night.</p>
<p>By the time rescue teams arrived, the baroque Guarini chapel, which lies at the back of Turin's Renaissance cathedral and was home to the famous Turin shroud, was engulfed by flames.</p>
<p>Firemen managed to save the winding sheet, believed by many to have wrapped the body of Christ after his crucifixion, but the ornate chapel and a section of the palace were gutted.</p>
<p>A special cabinet meeting, called to discuss the blaze, announced a state of emergency for the area and released an immediate 12 billion lire ($7.1 million) for initial restoration work.</p>
<p>But Deputy Prime Minister Walter Veltroni said much more money would be needed to complete the task.</p>
<p>"The government believes it is necessary to put aside up to 100 billion lire for the reconstruction," he told a news conference. "The decisions taken today will allow us to work with the necessary speed for the first intervention."</p>
<p>Turin city council and the local region have earmarked 13 billion lire for the restoration and contributions were also pouring in from local businesses and people in this prosperous city, home of the Fiat car empire.</p>
<p>But ministerial experts said however much money was spent, the Guarini chapel and its intricate, cone-shaped dome could never be fully restored.</p>
<p>"Let's not delude ourselves. The reconstruction will be long, complex and difficult. But we've got to understand (the buildings) will not be put back as before," said Lino Malara, the head of the government cultural heritage agency in Turin.</p>
<p>He said some of the materials used in the original 17th century chapel, including a famous grey marble used at the base of the dome, were no longer available.</p>
<p>As investigators hunted for clues as to how the blaze started, local people suggested that the damage could have been limited if the fire brigade had been called earlier.</p>
<p>First warning of the fire came from the royal palace, which is connected to the back of the cathedral and which had hosted a dinner in honour of United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan earlier on Friday night.</p>
<p>"A little after 11 p.m. two guards came along saying the fire alarm had gone off and they were doing some checks," Irma Antonetto, head of the cateering service which prepared the gala dinner, was quoted as saying by Italian news agency Ansa.</p>
<p>Fire officials said they were first warned of the blaze at around 11.45 p.m. Rescue teams managed to pluck the mysterious shroud, one of the most revered relics in the Roman Catholic world, from the dramatic inferno but could not save the chapel.</p>
<p>The winding cloth is kept in a silver case to save it from exposure to potentially damaging air pollution or sun light. Church staff said they checked the cloth carefully on Monday.</p>
<p>"One can conclude with absolute certainty that there was no damage whatsoever," a statement from the Turin diocese said. "(The cloth) was completely identical to when it was last put on public display in 1978," it added.</p>
