<p>With his hand on a bushel of peppercorns, Yanto has an eye on the increasingly fussy consumers of his commodity in distant European pepper markets.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old pepper farmer knows the market demands a clean product and that traditional soaking of the pepper in the tepid streams and ponds in Bangka's main harvest season -- which coincides with the dry season -- is not good enough.</p>
<p>In the past, Yanto and the 2,000 pepper farmers in Air Gegas village have soaked the black pepper in whatever water was available for 10 days to provoke the natural reaction that turns the black peppercorn white.</p>
<p>"If we use small ponds, the pepper smells very bad," Yanto said during a visit to his farm. But the farmers have had no choice but to use stagnant water as the main harvest time falls in the middle of the dry season.</p>
<p>Community development worker Anton Soedjarwo is more succinct about what scarce water supply means for the export product: "The worst quality pepper smells like a septic tank."</p>
<p>The problem has tainted the Bangka "trademark" Muntok White Pepper (MWP), which has made this island off the southern coast of Sumatra famous for centuries as one of Indonesia's renowned spice islands.</p>
<p>In the wet season, Bangka's fast flowing streams are a source of plentiful and cheap water for the transformation of pepper. But when the rain stops, these rivers become a series of ponds shared with locals for many of their daily needs.</p>
<p>Since 1994, the Association of Indonesian Pepper Exporters (AIPE) has been aware of rising concern in consuming countries about the cleanliness of imported spices.</p>
<p>BACTERIAL POLLUTION</p>
<p>"We have been concerned as producers of white pepper about reports of millions of bacteria polluting pepper, salmonella dirtying paprika and aflatoxins being found in nutmeg and chili," AIPE executive secretary Syuhairi told a recent seminar.</p>
<p>"These findings are making consumers more cautious about using spices," Syuhairi said in a paper given to government officials, farmers and traders on Bangka recently.</p>
<p>In 1995, Indonesia exported almost 14,000 tonnes of white pepper worth more than $52 million, of which 80 percent came from Bangka. AIPE says this represents around 90 percent of the world's white pepper production.</p>
<p>Europe, Japan and the United States are the major markets.</p>
<p>Faizul Agus, general manager of export-import division of state-owned trading company PT Cipta Niaga, said traders had a key role to play in encouraging farmers to increase pepper quality.</p>
<p>"As exporters, we must care about quality and we must have farmers thinking about quality. If not, our exports will face obstacles," he told the seminar held on Bangka early in March.</p>
<p>Exporters say Hungary already requires that spice imports be tested for bacteria, and other countries are expected to follow suit. Farmers received a premium of about 500 rupiah (20 cents) per kilogram for a clean and high quality product.</p>
<p>Last year, farmers on Bangka received between 10,700 rupiah ($4.45) and 5,600 rupiah ($2.33) a kilogram in a fluctuating local market involving many middlemen and speculators. Traders then sold MWP for around $465/tonne cnf.</p>
<p>PILOT PROJECT</p>
<p>But while Moslem farmers, exporters and local government officials were slow to warm to the idea, they have now eagerly embraced a pilot project funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development at Air Gegas.</p>
<p>"We had to show the farmers a passage in the Koran about the importance of cleanliness in all aspects of life," Soedjarwo told Reuters.</p>
<p>With a delegation of European pepper importers due to visit Indonesia in June, all parties have new impetus to show they can rise to the challenges of the demand for safe, clean foodstuffs by the consumers of their traditional product.</p>
<p>Soedjarwo's group Dian Desa was hired by the Jakarta-based Agribusiness Development Project (ADP) to build the pilot white pepper processing facility project.</p>
<p>While costly chemical processes could probably produce the same outcome, the facility consisting of four large ferro-cement soaking tanks and 12 smaller washing tanks taps into the free and unused water in the hundreds of flooded and abandoned tin mine pits.</p>
<p>"We are lucky because the mining company has been very diligently making lakes all over Bangka," Soedjarwo said.</p>
<p>ADP chief Joe Welsh from the Washington-based firm Development Alternatives Inc (DAI) said he hoped the facility was the first of many serving the estimated 65,000 families who rely on white pepper for their livelihood on Bangka.</p>
<p>"We hope ways can be found to make this available to many families on Bangka," he said.</p>
