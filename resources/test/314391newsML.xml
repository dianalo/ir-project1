<p>European oil swaps trimmed their losses as crude oil rebounded, but they still ended slightly weaker on Friday after a volatile week punctuated by weather and technicals.</p>
<p>IPE March Brent lost nearly $2 a barrel from its high last week as speculators locked in profits from their positions initiated at the start of the year.</p>
<p>Gas oil futures also fell despite the Arctic weather gripping key heating oil regions in the U.S., though forecasters said the worst may be over after the weekend in the Northeast.</p>
<p>"It's unchanged despite all the noise," said one distillate swaps trader, of the gas oil cracks.</p>
<p>Second quarter gas oil crack spread swaps were steady at $4.15/$4.30 and the third quarter at $4.75/$4.85. Fourth quarter swaps changed hands at $5.45/$5.50 and first quarter 1998 at $5.35, he said.</p>
<p>In the crude market, weekly Brent CFDs shaved their losses to trade mixed from Thursday for the next three weeks.</p>
<p>For Jan 20-24, CFDs were unchanged at +12/+15 cents over March Brent, and edged up slightly for Jan 27-31 to +12/+15 cents.</p>
<p>Analysts warned that despite the sharp selloff this week after heating oil inventories were replenished on both sides of the Atlantic, crude oil's bull market may not be completely over yet.</p>
<p>A year ago, Brent lost about $2 between January and February, only to surge again when cold weather again hit the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Jet fuel swaps fell 50 cents to $1 after the gas oil selloff, with Feb ending at a $32/$33 premium to IPE and March a $33/$34 premium, traders said.</p>
<p>But heightened interest for next winter's swaps pushed up those prices slightly, one trader said.</p>
<p>Fourth quarter jet gained $1 on the bid side to $36/$36.50 and first quarter 1998 witnessed fresh interest at $37/$37.50 over IPE, he said.</p>
<p>Fuel oil swaps recovered from weaker early levels due to crude oil and a correction to this week's fuel selloff, traders said.</p>
<p>But lethargic bunker demand and expectations for three cargoes to hit Europe early next month were expected to cap further gains, they said.</p>
<p>Feb low sulphur fuel oil swaps last traded at $108, $108.50 and $109 while high sulphur barges were heard up slightly at $104.50/$105.50.</p>
<p>Naphtha swaps ended $2/$4 lower with last trades heard done at $220 for Jan, $216 for Feb and $213 for March, traders said.</p>
