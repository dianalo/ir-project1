<p>The American Automobile Manufacturers Association said Tuesday it sued New York state over its requirement that carmakers produce electric vehicles to sell in the state.</p>
<p>The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in New York is the latest in the long-running dispute the automakers have had with New York and Massachusetts, which have mandates that the manufacturers start producing a percentage of electric vehicles to sell in those states.</p>
<p>The AAMA has filed a similar complaint against Massachusetts, a spokesman said.  </p>
<p>New York's electric vehicle requirement is to take effect in the 1998 model year, which starts in September.</p>
<p>It would require two percent of vehicles offered for sale to be "zero emission" or electric in model year 1998, up to 10 percent by 2003, Gary Sheffer, spokesman for New York's Department of Environmental Conservation, said.</p>
<p>The automakers insist that under the federal Clean Air Act, New York may only adopt emissions control requirements that are identical to California's.</p>
<p>California dropped its electric vehicle requirements for 1998 through 2002.  </p>
<p>However New York and Massachusetts have said they have a right to impose mandate to help improve their air quality through cleaner cars.</p>
<p>"We believe that we have clear authority under the Clean Air Act to impose a mandate for electric vehicles," Sheffer, of the New York department, said.</p>
<p>The dispute also has stalled efforts to introduce an environmentally-cleaner car nationwide under a deal being negotiated among northeastern states, the automakers and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  </p>
<p>The AAMA has insisted that the two states drop their electric vehicle mandates before it would sign onto the voluntary program to produce cleaner conventional gasoline-powered cars, but the states have refused.</p>
<p>"We believe that we can pursue a 49-state car and electric vehicles concurrently," Sheffer said, referring to the nickname of the car the automakers proposed for all states but California, which has stricter auto emissions requirements.</p>
