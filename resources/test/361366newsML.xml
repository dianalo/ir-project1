<p>Iraq's state-owned Rafidain Bank will partly resume operations in Bahrain, six years after its activities were suspended following the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq's charge d'affaires said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Rafidain Bank's administration has returned to the bank after a Bahraini court ruled in favour of the bank. It has recovered its deposit from (Gulf International Bank) and is now able to meet customer demands," Ahmed Tayes Abdullah told Reuters.</p>
<p>The commercial bank was placed under the control of the Bahrain Monetary Agency (BMA), the Gulf Arab state's central bank, soon after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in August 1990, when it failed to meet customers' demands.</p>
<p>Abdullah said Gulf International Bank (GIB) had seized an estimated $2.5 million deposit of Rafidain's Bahrain branch.</p>
<p>He said Rafidain would resume activities once it had enough liquidity, but did not elaborate.</p>
<p>A GIB official declined to comment.</p>
<p>Bankers said Rafidain's operations would be restricted due to United Nations sanctions imposed on Iraq after its invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Abdullah said the private sector in Bahrain owes Rafidain Bank around five million dinars ($13.3 million) in loans. "The bank will work to retrieve the amount," he said.</p>
<p>Bahrain's Gulf Daily News on Thursday quoted BMA executive director of banking control Khalid Ateeq as saying BMA "will still keep a close watch" on Rafidain's activities.</p>
