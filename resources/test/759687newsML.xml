<p>Investors can look ahead to gains this week as Latin American equity markets get back on their feet after staggering earlier in the month on volatility in Brazil, analysts say.</p>
<p>Mexican stocks can expect to zigzag at the beginning of the week on mixed reactions to second quarter earnings as the reporting season comes to a close.  </p>
<p>"I think investors will be prepared to ignore earnings disappointments and buy on the improving economy," said Geoffrey Dennis, emerging markets strategist at HSBC-James Capel.</p>
<p>The blue chip IPC share index ended at 4,722.42 on Friday, up just 1.86 points on the week or 0.04 percent after a sharp volatility on shifting reactions to company earnings.</p>
<p>Brazilian stocks are expected to remain firm this week, maintaining a slight upward trend but losing the high volatility of recent sessions as investors consolidate last week's strong gains, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Volume is likely to remain slender compared with the hefty turnover of recent weeks and traders foresee little market-moving news as Congress ended its extraordinary session on Friday.</p>
<p>The Bovespa index of 47 most active shares in Sao Paulo ended flat at 12,523 points Friday, but gained 11.9 percent for the week, recouping much of the ground it lost earlier in July when prices plunged on devaluation fears and profit-taking.  </p>
<p>Argentine stocks are expected to continue their recovery from recent heavy losses this week, pushing cautiously to a new five-year high, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Conditions are right for more modest gains, because Wall Street is still basking in (U.S. Fed chief Alan) Greenspan's comments and the corporate results period here is about to start with good forecasts," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The blue-chip MerVal index rebounded 4.9 percent to 841.19 last week, recovering most of the losses incurred a week earlier due to devaluation fears in Brazil.  </p>
<p>Dealers say shares on the Caracas Stock Exchange are likely to notch up gains after throwing off the doldrums induced by Brazil's "samba" volatility.</p>
<p>The .IBC general index rose to a record close of 9,716.46, up 6.6 percent for the week.</p>
<p>Market watchers will be waiting to see if the government goes ahead with a 27 percent increase in gasoline prices next week as planned.  </p>
<p>"I think the market will continue to rise. There's no bad news, and if the government raises the price of gasoline and doesn't back down, things will really pick up," Profimerca broker Miguel Gonzlez said.</p>
<p>After zigzagging through last week, Chilean shares are seen stable this week as investors wait for the last of second quarter results, which must be published by the end of the month, dealers say.</p>
<p>"We don't expect much movement except for completely one-off cases as stocks adjust to earnings," said Guillermo Tagle, head of research at Santander Investment.</p>
<p>Electricity shares are likely to continue their rally on media reports of stronger-than-expected earnings from Enersis, Chile's largest energy group, dealers say.</p>
<p>The 40-share .IGPA index ended the week up 3.5 percent at 134.62 points, with the market rallying strongly four days in a row.</p>
