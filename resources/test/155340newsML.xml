<p>Guam Power Authority (GPA) on Wednesday said it awarded an annual term purchase contract for fuel oil to Daxin Petroleum Pte Ltd, after talks with two other companies fell through.</p>
<p>Daxin was awarded the contract after it offered 2.0 percent sulphur fuel oil at $2.23 per barrel over spot quotes of Singapore's 3.5-percent sulphur grade fuel oil, on a cost-and-freight (c-and-f) basis, said GPA general manager Randy Wiegand.  </p>
<p>The 1.19-percent sulphur fuel oil was awarded to Daxin at $3.15-per-barrel premium over Singapore's spot quotes for 3.5-percent sulphur grade, c-and-f, he said.</p>
<p>The contract runs August 1, 1996 to July 30, 1997 and a conversion factor of 6.0 barrels per tonne was used for pricing the fuel oil, he said.</p>
<p>Wiegand said a regional company, which had made the lowest offer, was initially awarded the contract. It delivered two 280,000-barrel cargoes in June and July but the deal was terminated mid-July because the company could not give "a satisfactory performance bond."  </p>
<p>GPA approached British Petroleum &amp; Co Plc, which had made the second best offer, but a deal was not concluded, prompting GPA to approach Daxin that had made the third best offer.</p>
<p>GPA recently also concluded five contracts to purchase 0.5-percent sulphur diesel from the local affiliates of Royal/Dutch Shell and Mobil Corp for deliveries between October 1, 1996 and September 30, 1997, he said.  </p>
<p>The prices of the two biggest contracts, which were 15 million gallons (358,000) each, were at a premium of 7.94 cents per gallon to Singapore spot quotes fob, and 7.63 cents per gallon premium to Singapore spot quotes, fob.</p>
