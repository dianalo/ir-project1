<p>Oman on Sunday announced that nominations for a new consultative Shura Council, which will include women for the first time, will be held on October 16.</p>
<p>An Interior Ministry statement published by the official Omani news agency said Omanis wishing to run in the elections should register between August 19 and 27, while Omanis in the country's 59 provinces should head to polling stations to nominate candidates on October 16.</p>
<p>After the polls, Sultan Qaboos has the final say in picking the candidates.</p>
<p>Oman's Sultan Qaboos in June issued a landmark decree allowing women across the country to stand for election to the 80-member consultative body, seen as an important sounding board for public opinion.</p>
<p>The sultan's directive also enabled women to choose candidates for the council.</p>
<p>During Oman's last Shura Council elections in 1994, the government granted women living in the capital Muscat the right to stand for election and make nominations, but their participation was limited to the capital's six provinces.</p>
<p>In an unprecedented move in conservative Gulf Arab states, Sultan Qaboos appointed two of the nominated women to the council in November 1994.</p>
<p>Oman, a small independent oil producer, announced the creation of the Shura Council in 1991. The body studies legislation and is intended to widen representation in the government.</p>
<p>Some other Gulf states have similar consultative bodies and Kuwait has a parliament, but they do not include women.</p>
