<p>Two high-quality tries from Springbok fullback Andre Joubert inside the last 15 minutes swept defending champions Natal past Transvaal to their fourth Currie Cup title in seven years on Saturday.</p>
<p>Their 33-15 win was cemented in the 65th minute when Joubert received a back-flip pass from centre Jeremy Thomson, and burst through at pace to score under the posts from 30 metres out.</p>
<p>He went over again six minutes later, collecting his own chip ahead and racing round to give Henry Honiball a second comfortable conversion. Honiball landed a total of seven kicks from 10 attempts.</p>
<p>Transvaal had previously kept in touch with five penalties from the boot of full-back Gavin Lawless but could not prevent Natal, who lost to Auckland in this year's Super 12 final, finishing the Currie Cup season unbeaten in their 15 outings.</p>
<p>"You have to give Natal the credit. Andre (Joubert) had a superb game and showed he is world-class. They deserved their victory," Transvaal captain Francois Pienaar said afterwards.</p>
<p>Pienaar, playing his 100th match for the province, was unable to secure the victory which would have gone some way to compensating for his shock dismissal as Springbok captain two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The Currie Cup final was a successful one, though, for Springbok coach Andre Markgraaff. With no significant injuries to any of his national squad players, the South African tour party for Argentina, France and Wales can leave with a clean bill of heath at the end of the month.</p>
