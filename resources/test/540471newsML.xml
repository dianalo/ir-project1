<p>The 550 megawatt (MW) unit 3 at the Laramie River Station (LRS) in Wheatland, Wyoming, will be taken off-line Friday for about six weeks of planned maintenance, according to sources familiar with the plant's operations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the plant's 550 MW unit 2 continues to operate near 60 percent capacity, but was expected to resume full operations around midnight Thursday, the sources said.</p>
<p>The third 550 MW unit at LRS was said to be operating normally.</p>
<p>Basin Electric Cooperative, headquartered in Bismark, North Dakota, operates and has a 42 percent interest in the plant, with five other Midwest utilities co-owning the remaining interest.</p>
