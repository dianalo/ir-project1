<p>The following stories were reported in Monday's electronic version of The Wall Street Journal:</p>
<p>* Industrial production rose 0.5 percent in February while wholesale prices fell 0.4 percent, more data for the Federal Reserve to consider when it meets next week to review the need for a rate increase.</p>
<p>* Investment guru Warren Buffet told stockholders in his annual report that most stocks were overvalued.</p>
<p>* Apple announced plans to cut 30 percent of its workforce and forecast its lowest quarterly revenues in three years.</p>
<p>* Ford said Taurus sedan production was suspended at two factories this week, a sign of more competition.</p>
<p>* H.J. Heinz said it would shut 25 plants, take a $650 million pretax charge and cut its workforce as part of a restructuring plan.</p>
<p>* The cable industry is planning a campaign to prevent or delay Rupert Murdoch and EchoStar'  proposed $1 billion satellite-TV venture.</p>
<p>* The FDA approved Abbott's Norvir and Agouron's Viracept, both protease inhibitors, to treat children with AIDS.</p>
<p>* ESPNET SportsZone is expected to be the first large Web site to charge daily, rather than monthly or annual, access fees.</p>
<p>* Applied Magnetics will have to seek alternative ways to fill a hole in its product line, after backing away from its hostile takeover bid for Read-Rite.</p>
<p>* Colony Capital is teaming up with Koll Real Estate and Apollo Real Estate to win control of Santa Anita, a racetrack and real-estate firm.</p>
<p>* AMR's American Airlines' pilot-union talks would likely continue through today or tomorrow, according to the Presidential Emergency Board president.</p>
<p>* TCF Financial said it would buy Standard Financial in a cash and stock deal valued at roughly $424 million.</p>
<p>* Marshall &amp; Ilsley said it would acquire Security Capital in a cash and stock deal valued at $945 million.</p>
<p>* Heard on the Street: Care to guess what has been the highest-flying of the larger technology stocks in the past year? It isn't Intel, Microsoft or even Iomega . Of stocks with more than $1 billion in market value, the biggest percentage gainer is Dell Computer, a company that does nothing more complicated than assemble computers and mail them to customers.</p>
<p>* Credit markets: Wall Street's smart money is betting on a rate increase but not much of one. Hedge funds and Wall Street strategists argue that recently released economic figures will force the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee to raise interest rates when it meets March 25. But they are forecasting a limited increase of 1/4 to 1/2 percentage point in the Fed Funds rate.</p>
