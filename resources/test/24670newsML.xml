<p>A Reuters survey of economists had forecast a 0.7 percent rise in the second quarter after the 0.3 percent rise/fall in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>The agency said Canada's trade surplus reached an 11-year high but businesses undertook substantial inventory liquidation.</p>
<p>"The demand for housing also contributed to the overall second-quarter growth as the recovery that began in the first quarter of the year gained momentum," it said.  </p>
