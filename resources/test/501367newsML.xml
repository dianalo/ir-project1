<p>Australia will soon announce successful bidders for long-term leases on some of the country's major state-owned airports, with new owners expected to take over next month, the government said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Finance Minister John Fahey and Transport Minister John Sharp said in a joint statement they had received revised bids from six short-listed consortia on Thursday for Melbourne, Perth and Brisbane airports.</p>
<p>"The government sales team will evaluate revised bids over an expected two week period and decisions by the government are anticipated shortly thereafter," they said.</p>
<p>The government has not named the shortlisted bidders.</p>
<p>"Execution of sales contracts is expected to occur sequentially throughout May," the ministers said.  </p>
<p>The government will consider price, ownership diversity, regional development plans, environmental issues and management ability in deciding the winners.</p>
<p>Canberra announced last month it had shortlisted the six consortia -- with a total of 13 separate bids -- in the contest for 50-year leases for the first three of more than 20 capital city and major regional airports.</p>
<p>The government has not said how much it hopes to raise from the programme, but market estimates range up to A$3 billion for the first three airports alone.  </p>
<p>Major contenders include the Australian Pacific Airports Corporation, a consortium of Britain's BAA Plc, Australian Mutual Provident Society and Axiom Funds Management; Australian Airport Services, a group with Brambles Ltd, Lend Lease Corp and Irish government-owned airport authority Aer Rianta; a consortium involving Macquarie Bank Ltd and Manchester Airport; and Airport Group Australia, with Lockheed Martin Ltd, Soros Capital, GE Capital and United Infrastructure.</p>
