<p>Love them or loathe them, mobile phones are either a vital way of staying in touch or an irritating symptom of 1990s convenience culture.</p>
<p>There is little doubt on which side of the argument most South Africans stand.</p>
<p>Licences for mobile phone networks were only granted in 1994, but hundreds of thousands of South Africans have bought the ubiquitous handsets that can now be seen from Cape Town to the Kruger Park.</p>
<p>The size of the market is estimated at nearly one million subscribers to the two networks so far granted licences, Mobile Telephones Networks (MTN) and Vodacom, making the country one of world's fastest-growing markets.</p>
<p>MTN is owned by Cable &amp; Wireless Plc And several local interests including M-Cell Ltd. Vodacom is a joint-venture between state-owned Telkom, Rembrandt Ltd and Britain's Vodafone Plc.</p>
<p>Both networks, which operate on a system called Global System for Mobile, or GSM, are bullish about future prospects. "(Growth) is not slowing down at all from our point of view," said Joan Joffe, Vodacom group executive for corporate affairs.</p>
<p>Vodacom estimates the South African market will have jumped to about three to four million phones by 2006 on the back of technological advances and product innovations that will easily keep pace with more developed parts of the world.</p>
<p>MARKET HAS UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS</p>
<p>The South African market, emerging from decades of isolation during the apartheid era, has several unique characteristics.</p>
<p>The fact that South Africa came to the mobile phone late is in some ways an advantage as it can learn from the mistakes of more mature markets and kick off with already advanced technologies.</p>
<p>But like many other aspects of South African life, mobile phone use is deeply split along economic lines and these fractures often mimic racial boundaries.</p>
<p>The majority of phones are used by white, urban populations in major centres like Johannesburg and Cape Town.</p>
<p>The phones are enormously popular, partly because of a need for security. South Africa's notorious violent crime wave -- concentrated in the cities -- has given many of its citizens good cause to stay closely in touch.</p>
<p>"Security has got to be one of the most important reasons for personal users. People are nervous and frightened of breaking down in remote areas," Joffe said.</p>
<p>Vodacom says this market is still growing quickly. "It is not saturated at all. There is enormous potential," Joffe added.</p>
<p>But if white South Africa is still snapping up the phones, what of the rest of the country?</p>
<p>Industry experts say the market potential here is also large. "We believe there is a huge reservoir of potential users in the black market," said Jacques Sellschop, an MTN spokesman.</p>
<p>But until South Africa's economy starts to substantially raise the average income of its poorer inhabitants it may have to be exploited differently.</p>
<p>One sign of this is develoments in the Transkei area, one of several former "independent" homelands where apartheid's white rulers tried to shunt the majority black population.</p>
<p>Last year Vodacom and MTN rolled out networks there at a total cost of 50 million rand ($10.82 million) to provide a web of public cellular phones often based on privately run "phone shops".</p>
<p>The move was seen by government as desperately needed. No network extension had taken place in the Transkei since 1988 and a mere 19,000 phones served four million people.</p>
<p>A THIRD LICENCE MAY BE GRANTED SOON</p>
<p>Moves are afoot to grant a third mobile phone licence. In a nod to the need and potential of the less developed segments of South Africa's population, industry sources expect a commitment to serve that market will have to be a major part of the winning licensee's bid.</p>
<p>Connie Molusi, spokesman for Post and Telecommunications Minister Jay Naidoo, said it was too early to say what the exact details of any future third licence would be.</p>
<p>"Everything is just speculation," Molusi said.</p>
<p>But a feasibilty study into a third licence will be complete by the start of next year and industry figures expect bidding to open some time later in 1998.</p>
<p>FIRMS LOOK TO REST OF THE REGION AND SATELLITE PHONES</p>
<p>If South African networks are faced with expansion opportunities in their own country, they are also licking their lips at the prospects offered by neighbouring states.</p>
<p>Namibia, Botswana and Zambia are among countries that have opened their doors to private cellular phone companies. Vodacom is bidding for Botswana's licence and mulling bids for others. MTN has roaming agreements with Namibia and is exploring areas of mutual interest in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p>"MTN has had numerous approaches from countries further north and various options are currently being examined," Sellschop said.</p>
<p>Part of the reason for expanding into the rest of the region is to ensure neighbouring countries are also GSM networks and don't sign up to rival systems like CDMA, which is becoming popular in the United States, or Japan's Personal Handyphone.</p>
<p>However, the whole region poses geographical problems. Desert, trackless bush and mountains often make all forms of conventional communication difficult.</p>
<p>Here is where global developments in satellite mobile phone technology may come into play.</p>
<p>Several large consortia, such as the 17 firms that make up the Iridium group, are ploughing funds into setting up a network of satellites that will allow special mobile phones to be used from anywhere on the globe. Vodacom is part of the Global Star consortium.</p>
<p>"We have got areas where there will never be conventional telecommunications, because it is just not commercially viable. This may be the answer to that problem," Joffe said.</p>
