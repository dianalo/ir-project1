<headline>GOLF-NOBILO: TIME TO STOP COMPLAINING ABOUT EUROPEAN TOUR.</headline>

<p>New Zealander Frank Nobilo says it is time to stop complaining about the European Tour and its executive director Ken Schofield.</p>
<p>Nobilo, who has played primarily in Europe for the past 11 years, believes many younger players are expecting too much, too soon.</p>
<p>The European Tour has been harshly criticised recently for, among other things, the condition of some of the courses it has played on, as well as the perceived arrogance of officials.</p>
<p>Schofield has also been a target of the attacks, but Nobilo sought him out at last week's Volvo Masters to offer his support.</p>
<p>"I had a long chat with Ken to tell him I am right behind what he is trying to do," Nobilo said on Saturday at the Sarazen World Open in Georgia.</p>
<p>"Europe has exploded the last six or seven years, especially in prize money terms. We are playing for more and more money in Europe each year. That is what people want, but a lot of people want everything at once.</p>
<p>"They want the best practice facilities, the courses in the best possible condition, but it all takes money and time."</p>
<p>Nobilo said it was unrealistic to expect the European Tour to be as good as the American Tour, because of the latter's longer history.</p>
<p>Despite his comments, Nobilo wants to become a U.S. Tour member, not because he is unhappy with Europe, but because he believes he needs to play here to maximise his chances of winning a major championship.</p>
<p>"I am 36, and I will not get too many opportunities to win a major. It is an effort to try and practice in slightly better conditions and improve my game," he said.</p>
<p>He is trying to get U.S. Tour commissioner Tim Finchem to reclassify Europe as his home tour, rather than Australasia.</p>
<p>That would allow him to play a minimum 15 U.S. events next year, and as many as he wanted in Europe as well. Under his current classification, he would have to obtain a release from Finchem every time he wanted to play in Europe.</p>
<p>"I enjoy playing on both sides of the Atlantic," said Nobilo, who plans to keep living in London. "If I come to America next year, I still want to play in Europe."</p>
<p>Nobilo would like to play seven or eight of the bigger European events, no doubt concentrating on the U.S. Tour for the first half of the year.</p>
