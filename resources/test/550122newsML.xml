<p>Slovakia's largest commercial bank Vseobecna Uverova Banka (VUB) a.s. held its annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday and said it would make its 1996 results public on Friday.</p>
<p>Bank officials would make no comment on the outcome of the AGM, which was expected to approve the 1996 results.</p>
<p>VUB posted an after-tax loss of 1.315 billion crowns in the first three quarters of 1996, compared with a 2.187 billion crown profit in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The bank started loan portfolio restructuring last year which, it said, was the main factor behind the loss.</p>
<p>VUB accounts for about one third of company loans in the country. The bank said last year that its swing to loss in January-September period in 1996 was due mainly to accounting changes which attempt "to minimalise accounting interest on arrears which could become irredeemable claims".</p>
<p>It added that it had not accounted for revenue from classified loans.</p>
<p>VUB, which is controlled by the state through a majority stake held by the state National Property Fund, the privatisation agency, is one of three largest Slovak banks still awaiting privatisation,.</p>
<p>VUB shares are listed on the main floor of the Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE). The stock did not trade on Tuesday after closing at 1,450 crowns on Monday.</p>
