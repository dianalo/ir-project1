<headline>Eli Lilly net jumps 11 percent; stock falls on currency warning.</headline>
<dateline>INDIANAPOLIS</dateline>
<text>
<p>Eli Lilly &amp; Co. reported Monday an 11 percent rise in first-quarter earnings, but its stock dropped after the drug company warned that foreign exchange fluctuations could hurt its earnings this year.</p>
<p>The drug giant said it earned $432.6 million, or 79 cents a share, vs. year-earlier earnings of $389.2 million, or 71 cents a share.</p>
<p>Revenues rose to $1.95 billion from $1.78 billion.</p>
<p>Lilly said its earnings would have been even higher had it not been for a $24 million charge to discontinue a collaboration arrangement with biotechnology firm Somatogen Inc. Excluding that charge, it would have earned 82 cents a share, Lilly said.</p>
<p>The Indianapolis-based company's stock lost $1.375 to $83.625 on the New York Stock Exchange after it later warned industry analysts in a conference call of potential damage to its 1997 earnings from currency exchange swings.</p>
<p>Analysts said Lilly also talked down the future sales potential of ReoPro, a blood clot-busting drug it markets for Centocor Inc., but talked up the outlook for Zyprexa, a new anti-schizophrenia drug.</p>
<p>"They gave some slightly more conservative guidance than they had in the past," said Alex Zisson, an analyst for Hambrecht &amp; Quist.</p>
