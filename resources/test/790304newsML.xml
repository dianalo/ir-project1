<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures ended mixed Monday in a fairly active session, with front months powering to new highs on reports of firmer physical prices and some follow-through technical buying.</p>
<p>September, which rallied today to a new contract high of $2.605 per million British thermal units, closed up 8.3 cents at $2.586. October, which also hit a new benchmark of $2.60, settled 6.3 cents higher at $2.578. Others ended mixed.</p>
<p>"Everyday it's the same thing - people are short the physical market. There's no weather, but every dip has been bought," said one East Coast trader.</p>
<p>While rising concerns about lagging storage builds in recent weeks helped drive September up more than 20 percent in nine sessions, some noted weekly injections of just 68 bcf were needed through October to get stocks back to 2.8 tcf.</p>
<p>And with little or no weather support on the horizon and near-record open interest, some technical traders said the market was overbought and due for a correction.</p>
<p>Temperatures in the Midwest and East this week are mostly expected to hover below seasonal levels, while the Southwest is forecast to remain hot.</p>
<p>Chartists pegged September resistance at the new contract high of $2.605, with further selling likely in the spot continuation gaps above $2.64 from late January. Support was seen in the $2.34 area and then at $2.30, with better buying likely at $2.25-2.27. Further support points were at $2.20 and then along the short-term up trendline near $2.16.</p>
<p>In the cash Monday, Gulf Coast prices rebounded more than 15 cents to near the $2.50 level. Midcon pipes jumped about 20 cents to the mid-$2.40s. New York city gate gas also firmed 20 cents to the low-$2.70s.</p>
<p>NYMEX said 66,483 contracts traded, up from Friday's revised tally of 59,418. The NYMEX Henry Hub 12-month strip rose 2.8 cents to $2.42.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, September finished 7.5 cents higher at $2.48, while deferreds ended up by five to seven cents. The East/West spread widened by 0.8 cent to 10.6 cents (NYMEX premium). KCBT said 709 lots traded, down slightly from Friday's total of 717.</p>
