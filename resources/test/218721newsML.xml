<p>The Thai consumer price index rose a moving average of 5.9 percent year-on-year during January/November against 5.7 pct in the same period a year ago, a senior commerce ministry official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sompol Kiatpaibul, permanent secretary for commerce, told an economic seminar he expected Thai inflation for the whole of 1996 to average 5.8 percent, unchanged from 1995.  </p>
<p>He did not give the actual November CPI. The index is normally calculated by the commerce ministry by the 25th of each month.</p>
<p>The official said CPI was projected to ease to about 5.5 percent in 1997 based on expected stable oil and lower commodity prices next year.</p>
<p>He said costs of domestic manufactured products and construction materials were also likely to be kept from rising substantially in 1997 because of competition.</p>
