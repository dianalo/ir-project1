<p>Olympic high jump and hurdles champions have been added to the undercard of the Donovan Bailey-Michael Johnson 150-meter match race at SkyDome on June 1, organisers said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Cuban world high jump record-holder Javier Sotomayor, the 1992 Olympic champion, and American Charles Austin, who won gold at the 1996 Atlanta Games, will meet in a one-to-one competition.</p>
<p>Sweden's Olympic champion Ludmila Enquist will face American Gail Devers, the Olympic 100 meters sprint gold medallist, in a women's 100-meter hurdles match race.</p>
<p>Bailey, won won the 100 meters at Atlanta in world record time, and Johnson, who claimed an unprecedented men's Olympic double with victories in the 200 and 400 meters, are seeking to settle bragging rights to the claim as world's fastest man.</p>
<p>Last week, organisers added a pole vault competition between South Africa's Okkert Brits and Sergei Bubka of Ukraine and a long jump duel between American Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Germany's Heike Dreschler.</p>
