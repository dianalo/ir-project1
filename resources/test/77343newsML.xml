<p>Nethold, the Dutch-based media group which is merging with France's Canal Plus, said on Wednesday that the group planned to launch a new, Europe-wide decoder to unscramble pay-television signals.</p>
<p>The merger brings together the two decoder systems currently on the market, giving the enlarged group the power to determine which technology will be adopted in the longer term.</p>
<p>The existence of two parallel systems had raised fears of a battle over technology standards similar to the wars between VHS and Betamax video recorders and rival British satellite dishes.</p>
<p>"The two technologies will continue to operate separately and will converge in the medium term," Nethold business development manager Sergio Iasi told Reuters Financial Television in an interview.</p>
<p>Asked for more details of future plans, he added: "We plan to come out with a third box common to all broadcasters."</p>
<p>A German consortium that was to have set up a common decoder collapsed earlier this month in the wake of the announcement of Canal Plus's takeover of Nethold. The takeover is expected to become final in the next four to five months.</p>
<p>The two decoders are the Seca system, which Canal Plus created with German media group Bertelsmann, and Nethold's Igeto, which is being used by Bavarian media mogul Leo Kirch in his DF1 digital pay TV channel.</p>
