<p>Northern Ireland's Orange Order performed an about-turn on generations of stubborn opposition on Friday and cancelled a series of contentious parades to avoid igniting further violent Catholic opposition.</p>
<p>The centuries-old organisation said in a statement its decision had been taken "for the greater good of the province" after the worst week of violence for decades.</p>
<p>It blamed the upheaval on its ideological foes, Sinn Fein, political wing of IRA guerrillas fighting British rule of the province and supported by the minority Catholic population.</p>
<p>But it called off flashpoint parades planned on Saturday, the most cherished day in its calendar, in Belfast's Lower Ormeau Road, Armagh and Newry and rerouted another march in Londonderry to avoid igniting further anger.</p>
<p>Catholic groups had threatened to swamp Belfast and Londonderry with mass protest and political sources said security chiefs told leaders of the organisation it could not guarantee the safety of marchers.</p>
<p>The decision was a major concession to Catholic Irish nationalists and was warmly welcomed by Britain and Ireland as a boost for their joint Northern Ireland peace process.</p>
<p>But it angered hardline members of the Organisation who saw it as a surrender to Sinn Fein and the Irish Republican Army (IRA), who have fought British rule of Northern Ireland for more than a generation.</p>
<p>Joel Patton, leader of the far-right Spirit of Drumcree group, told reporters: "It isn't a compromise. It's a capitulation."</p>
<p>He disputed predictions that the concession might persuade the IRA to call a new ceasefire, the price that Britain has demanded for its entry into Northern Ireland peace talks.</p>
<p>"This decision will not lead republicans to stop their violence. If they manage to stop four parades and get the Grand Lodge to surrender in this way, then they will up the ante..."</p>
<p>Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams quickly issued a statement welcoming a decision he had campaigned for for years.</p>
<p>"I welcome these decisions and acknowledge their significance," he said. "I wish it had been made earlier."</p>
<p>It ended a standoff between the Order and Catholic residents' associations who had threatened demonstrations to block the parades, which they regard as sectarian intimidation.</p>
<p>The parades are held on the "Glorious 12th" of July, which marks a 1690 victory by a Protestant king over an invading Catholic monarch. It is the organisation's most cherished day.</p>
<p>Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, said the decision would "be received with a great deal of relief and appreciation in Northern Ireland and beyond".</p>
<p>A spokesman for Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern said: "It is a very positive gesture by the Orange Order. The government believes it deserves an equally positive response from nationalists."</p>
<p>Jeffrey Donaldson, an Orange leader, said: "These decisions were decisions of local lodges. This is not something that was imposed on them. I must say they have my utmost admiration."</p>
<p>Police had voiced serious concern about the Lower Ormeau Road march, scene of violent confrontation in recent years.</p>
<p>The decision not to parade in the Belfast suburb was announced by the local Ballynafeigh Orange Lodge at the Protestant end of the Lower Ormeau Road.</p>
<p>Outside the lodge a small but angry crowd gathered, plainly displeased at the decision. They jostled journalists, shouting obscenities and forcing them away from the lodge entrance.</p>
<p>The Order, which wants to maintain the province's 300-year-old union with Britain, had come under intense pressure to cancel the parades after week-long violence caused by a march through a Catholic area in the town of Portadown last Sunday.</p>
<p>A radical IRA splinter group, the Irish National Liberation Army, had threatened to attack Orange Order members if they paraded along the Lower Ormeau Road.</p>
