<p>VeriFone Inc said on Wednesday it has struck a deal with Citicorp's Citibank under which Citibank will distribute VeriFone personal automated teller machines.</p>
<p>The Personal ATM devices are part of VeriFone's VeriSmart system and allow customers to download electronic cash to smart cards securely at home or in the office, the company said.</p>
<p>Citibank said selected customers will take part in an upcoming smart card pilot in New York later this year and will be able to use the system to connect to their bank account over the telephone and move electronic cash into smart cards.</p>
<p>Henry Lichstein, Citibank vice president in charge of smart card development, said the bank was continuing to innovate in the same way it had two decades ago in introducing ATM centers to make it easier to draw and deposit cash.</p>
<p>"Now we're introducing an ATM our customers can use, in conjunction with a smart card, in the comfort of their home or office or virtually anywhere else," he said.</p>
<p>Smart cards, which are already used widely in Europe and Asia, are plastic cards about the same size as credit cards but include an embedded microprocessor chip.</p>
<p>An estimated 645 million smart cards are currently being used in various parts of the world for small cash purchases, pay telephones, rapid transit, health care and government benefits, according to the two companies.</p>
