<headline>UK's Select Appointments seeks Nasdaq quote.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Select Appointments (Holdings) Plc said on Friday it intended to seek a secondary stock market listing on Nasdaq with a U.S. public offering of up to 10 million new shares and a secondary offering of existing shares.</p>
<p>Both offerings would be in American Depository Shares (ADS).</p>
<p>It also said it intended to move to the official list of the London stock exchange by the end of 1996.</p>
<p>"The completion of the U.S. public offering and the Nasdaq listing will place the group in a strong position for its future development," chairman Tony Martin said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Select, which is an international staffing services group, said sales in North America totalled 115.4 million stg in the year ending December 31, 1995, equivalent to 50.9 percent of total sales.</p>
<p>Select said it expected the U.S. to "continue to represent a major area of activity for the group."</p>
<p>Select said the precise size and price for the U.S. public offering would not be determined until immediately before the offering which will be after an extraordinary general meeting on November 4 to approve the moves.</p>
<p>But it said by way of example, if the offering were made at 338 pence per share, the middle market quotation for ordinary shares on October 9, then 10 million shares would raise approximately 30 million stg net of expenses.</p>
<p>Ordinary shares of the company are currently traded on the USM which is scheduled to close at the end of 1996, Select said.</p>
