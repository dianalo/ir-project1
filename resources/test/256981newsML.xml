<p>About 1,000 South Korean unionists held a rally in Seoul on Saturday demanding the government delay planned labour law changes and hold talks instead on the divisive regulations, witnesses said.</p>
<p>During the protest in the centre of the capital, the members of the outlawed Korea Confederation of Trade Unions also condemned Seoul for trying to revise the law that they say would favour business conglomerates, known as "chaebol", more than employees.</p>
<p>Hundreds of riot policemen were deployed around the site, but there were no reports of clashes between police and protesters during the three-hour rally.</p>
<p>The protesters also reaffirmed they could strike at any time unless the ruling New Korea Party scrapped legal revisions permitting layoffs and flexible work hours.</p>
<p>"If the government decides to delay the revision, we are willing to discuss along with the management and politicians over what the true revision of the labour law should be," Kwon Young-gil, chairman of the confederation, said in a speech.</p>
<p>On Friday, the confederation postponed a scheduled four-hour walkout by its 500,000 members in 300 companies, including Hyundai Motor Co and Daewoo Heavy Industries Co.</p>
<p>On Friday, an official at the New Korea Party hinted it might be unable to force the revision through this year.</p>
<p>The ruling party "feels a need to discuss the matter with the opposition before the bill is passed, and I don't think at the moment the other parties will accept the call for a debate," he said.</p>
<p>Opposition parties have united to demand a delay.</p>
<p>The country's largest labour union umbrella group, the Federation of Korean Trade Unions, said on Friday it would go ahead with stoppages planned for Monday and Thursday next week unless the government backed down.</p>
<p>The federation, which represents 1.2 million workers at 800 companies, plans a one-hour stoppage on Monday and a three-hour walkout on Thursday.</p>
<p>Employer groups object to changes in the restrictive labour legislation that would allow mulitiple unions in each workplace, a move they say would lead to greater militancy as labour unions vied for members.</p>
<p>The changes in the law would be the first revisions in 43 years.</p>
<p>South Korea was spurred to revise its labour laws because of its membership of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. It formally became the 29th member of the Paris-based club of rich nations on Thursday.</p>
