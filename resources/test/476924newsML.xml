<p>Scientists said on Monday they had been able to trick cells that do not normally make fluid into producing saliva in rats.</p>
<p>The finding could hold out hope for humans whose salivary glands are damaged by radiation therapy for head and neck cancers.</p>
<p>"It is an important first step to managing a condition for which no suitable and effective therapy is currently available," said Dr. Bruce Baum, a scientist at the National Institute of Dental Research. His findings appear in Tuesday's edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
<p>Cancer patients who cannot produce enough saliva suffer dry mouth, inflammation of the tissue lining the mouth, cavities, and trouble with swallowing, speech and taste.</p>
<p>The scientists were able to transfer a gene that makes an aquaporin protein -- a protein that forms pores in cell membranes that fluids can pass through. They managed to introduce this gene into ductal cells of rats, which are not destroyed by the radiation treatment and which do not normally produce fluid.</p>
