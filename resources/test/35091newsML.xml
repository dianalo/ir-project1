<p>U.S. stock index futures closed lower on technical selling and persistant nervousness ahead of Friday's release of U.S. nonfarm payroll data for August, traders said.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of panicking people who don't want to hold anything into the number tomorrow," observed one S&amp;P futures trader on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME).</p>
<p>Heavy selling by dealers was exacerbated by arbitrage sell programs and sell stops which were triggered in September S&amp;Ps between 654.00 and 652.00, traders said.  </p>
<p>Another CME trader said technical selling also fueled the afternoon slide.</p>
<p>"We were very technically weak in the afternoon. There's a liquidity gap between 654.20 and 653.80. That had very negative implications for the market around the bond close," he said.</p>
<p>Stop orders and sell programs added to the slide, as did heavy selling of December S&amp;Ps by one large U.S. brokerage firm, he said.  </p>
<p>Locals bought the December contract, sold the spread to cover it (selling December and buying September) and then sold the September contract to get flat, which further pressured the market, he said.</p>
<p>Another CME trader said a number of locals got long just as bond futures were closing, and found themselves squeezed.</p>
<p>"You had a lot of people getting long around the bond close, thinking they were going to rally the S&amp;Ps which happens quite often," he said.</p>
<p>However, heavy dealer selling then squeezed those positions out, he said.  </p>
<p>September S&amp;Ps closed down 7.60 at 649.00, the Russell 2000 was down 3.70 at 330.30, Value Lines were off 7.05 at 612.10, Nikkeis rose 155.0 at 20,320, and Midcaps were off 2.35 at 229.65.</p>
