<p>U.S. Gulf Coast conventional gasoline differentials ended near flat Monday after surging sharply higher early in the day ahead of a pipeline scheduling deadline.</p>
<p>Much of the early strength evaporated by the end of the day after traders covered their commitments, according to market watchers.</p>
<p>On the NYMEX, August gasoline gained 0.02 cent to end at 57.94 cents a gallon and August heating oil firmed 0.02 cent top settle at 52.78 cents.</p>
<p>U.S GULF</p>
<p>Prompt conventional M1 gasoline differentials jumped as high as 0.30 cents under the August NYMEX during Monday's action, up about 1.60 cent on the day, as traders scrambled to secure supplies ahead of the front 20th cycle scheduling deadline on the Colonial Pipeline at the end of the day. The same barrels were quoted between 1.50 and 1.75 cents under the screen near the end of the day.</p>
<p>"We started the day at 1.50 cents under (August) NYMEX and moved up to 0.50 cent under pretty quickly," one Gulf trader said. "It did slip back the end of the day."</p>
<p>Scheduling deadlines on the Colonial, the main artery from Houston's refinery row to the East Coast, have forced gasoline differetials to spike higher several times over the past two months. However, the strength has generally faded after a day or two, traders said.</p>
<p>Low sulphur diesel differentials gained modestly Monday, with prompt barrels changing hands at 1.65 cents under the August futures, up about 0.10 cent from last week.</p>
<p>MIDCONTINENT</p>
<p>In the Midcontinent, cash products markets remained quiet in afternoon trade. Many players, traders said, were still out on vacation following the July Fourth holiday weekend.</p>
<p>On the gasoline side, Group Three prompt regular unleaded differentials remained 1.75/2.00 cents over August NYMEX futures, with 1.80 cents done. Any month barrels were sold at 0.60 cents over the print.</p>
<p>Chicago gasoline differentials were slightly weaker in lackluster activity, with prompt pegged at 1.50/1.75 cts over the print. Third cycle barrels were talked 1.25/1.50 cents over the screen.</p>
<p>The distillate markets also remained quiet and unchanged.</p>
<p>NEW YORK HARBOR</p>
<p>Product differentials showed little movement in what traders dubbed as subdued trade Monday, though prompt reformulated A2 gasoline changed hands at 0.15 cent over the screen, up about 0.20 cent from last week's levels.</p>
<p>Prompt regular conventional M2 gasoline hovered near its previous range between about 2.25 and 2.50 cents under the August NYMEX price.</p>
