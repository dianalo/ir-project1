<p>A Jordanian Minister visiting Israel said on Thursday that some Israeli government policies were endangering the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>Jordanian Information Minister Marwan Muasher was asked on Israel Channel Two television what he would say to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when he met him on Friday.</p>
<p>"I will tell him that we want to work with the Israeli government in order to protect the achievements. But I will also tell him that there are certain policies of the government that are causing great danger," he replied.</p>
<p>Muasher said he would tell Netanyahu, elected in May on a right-wing platform, that Jordan was committed to the peace process but agreements needed to be implemented and statements on expanding Jewish settlements threatened peace.</p>
<p>"The peace situation is certainly in a great crisis," he said.</p>
<p>"We are talking about an atmosphere, a negative one that has been there in the area for some time because of the impasse, because of the delay in implementing agreements, because of statements such as ones on settlement policy."</p>
<p>Netanyahu earlier reiterated at the funeral of two Israelis killed by Arab gunmen near Ramallah in the West Bank that Israel would continue to expand Jewish settlements in the region.</p>
<p>Muasher arrived in Israel on Tuesday to try to break an impasse in negotiations on a delayed handover of the West Bank town of Hebron to Palestinian self-rule. Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.</p>
