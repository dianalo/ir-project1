<p>The dollar closed higher in Europe as traders eyed the outcome of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) which was widely expected to sanction a U.S. rate rise for the first time in two years.</p>
<p>Any annoucement from the meeting is not expected during European trading hours. Many in the market expect a quarter point rise in the Federal funds rate, so dealers were pondering a range of dollar scenarios.</p>
<p>"The problem for the dollar is that you never know whether it will take its lead from rates or asset markets," said David Bloom, currency strategist at HSBC Market in London.  </p>
<p>At 1557 GMT the dollar was at 1.6904/09 marks and 123.85/88 yen compared with 1.6872/77 and 122.88/93 in late European trading on Monday.</p>
<p>In a Reuters survey 34 of 48 economists expected the Fed to raise its funds target to at least 5.50 percent from the current 5.25 percent.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen was buoyed as the yen suffered at the hands of the mark and sterling. Mark/yen pushed towards key resistance at 73.35 yen but failed there once again, capping dollar/yen's subseqently. Sterling rose above 200 yen for the first time in almost five weeks.  </p>
<p>Fading speculation of a rise in key Japanese interest rates, sparked on Monday by a knock-on effect from expectations of a U.S. rate hike and by firming Japanese money market rates, was also boosting dollar/yen today, analysts said.</p>
<p>"What I would call ill-founded speculation of a rate hike in Japan has vanished, and dollar/yen is now realigning itself to dollar/mark," said Claudio Demolli, FX analyst at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Japanese money rates have been rising in the past days, and although many said this was due to seasonal fund demand ahead of Tokyo's fiscal year-end on March 31, there had been some nervousness about a possible change of Japan's easy-credit policy.  </p>
<p>A generous money market operation by the Bank of Japan on Tuesday, however, helped ease such fears.</p>
<p>The Swiss franc weakened sharply against the dollar and the mark. In late trade, it stood at 1.4655/60, up from 1.4556/66 at the previous European close. Mark/Swiss was at 86.65/68 from 86.28/30.</p>
<p>Dealers said there were several large orders to sell Swiss francs out of the U.S. but also noted that thin trade ahead of the FOMC exaggerated movements.</p>
