<p>The Federal Reserve Board on Friday denied suggestions that Fed Vice Chairwoman Alice Rivlin had indicated Thursday that there were limits on U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin's support for a strong dollar.</p>
<p>"Vice Chair Rivlin did not say in Lincoln, Nebraska, that Secretary Rubin has set limits to a strong a dollar policy," the Fed said in a statement.  </p>
<p>"Secretary Rubin is the U.S. spokesman on the dollar, and Vice Chair Rivlin fully supports Secretary Rubin's policy," the Fed added.</p>
<p>The statement was issued after a wire service report quoted Rivlin as saying during a business luncheon that excessive strength in the dollar punishes exporters. The report further quoted the Fed Vice Chairwoman as saying, "The Treasury secretaries always have to say they're for it, but there are limits, and (Treasury Secretary Robert) Rubin says basically we have a strong dollar now."  </p>
<p>The comments weighed on the dollar in currency trading on Friday, when the wire service story was issued.</p>
<p>Aside from the comments about Rubin, the statement did not address any other remarks attributed to Rivlin regarding the dollar.</p>
