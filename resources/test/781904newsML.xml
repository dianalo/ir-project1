<p>U.S. West Coast light crude prices fell Wednesday with broader market declines, while local trade inactive, traders said.</p>
<p>Oil markets fell in anticipation of resumed Iraqi oil exports.</p>
<p>In local markets, traders said Chevron's cargo of Colombian South Blend (API 29) cost $3.10 under September West Texas Intermediate (WTI), with freight at $1.40.</p>
<p>The move might weaken prices for lookalike Alaska North Slope (ANS) crude, traders said.</p>
<p>"(Chevron) will sell more ANS and that'll put more pressure on ANS," a trader said.</p>
<p>ANS crude, which has tightened eight cents a barrel since June, stood at $2.04 under September WTI after a cargo sold Tuesday.</p>
<p>Two refiners were heard looking for ANS, but the grade's main seller BP, stepped out of the market to evaluate in current price formula. BP did not sell the previous cargo.</p>
<p>Kern River and Wilmington grades remained flat, with no deals reported.</p>
