<p>LME copper edged higher in late inter-office trading on Tuesday evening, continuing the upward drift seen in ring trading.</p>
<p>Around 1900 GMT, three months copper was indicated at $2,287/90 per tonne, up a touch from a kerb close of $2,286.</p>
<p>Widening spreads and a modest draw in stocks earlier in the day have provided support to the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>The market may be gearing up for a retest of layers of resistance from $2,290 to the November 28 peak of $2,313, analysts said.</p>
<p>Aluminium was indicated firmer also at $1,590/93 versus a $1,584 kerb close.</p>
