<p>The Lebanese pound continued its rise against the U.S. dollar in a market quiet through the week ended on Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Lebanon lowered its bid-offer intervention band during the week to 1,544-1,553 pounds per dollar from 1,544.5-1,554 and the dollar traded at the bottom of the band throughout the week, dealers said.</p>
<p>Trade was restricted to a tight range of up to 50 piastres at the bid end of the intervention band, Talal Abou Zaki, manager of forex and money market for Bank of Beirut and the Arab Countries, told Reuters.</p>
<p>All of the offer of dollars was taken up by commercial banks, he added.</p>
<p>"Everything was quiet in the market, there were a few demand orders for dollars by banks at the beginning of the week but they were met," Abou Zaki said.</p>
<p>Investors were still interested in Lebanese pound-denominated treasury bills as yields continued to fall.</p>
<p>"There is no change in the market at all, and the trend is still the same. There are offers of dollars and demand for pounds because investors see the trend of the Lebanese pound interest rates decreasing," Abou Zaki said.</p>
