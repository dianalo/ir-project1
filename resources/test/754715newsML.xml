<p>German call money was steady at around three percent on Thursday amid ample liquidity conditions as traders predicted more steady rates in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>"We are not looking for any sort of surprises," said one dealer referring both to this session's Bundesbank council meeting and call money rates in the coming sessions.</p>
<p>Overnight funds traded down to around three percent on Wednesday after the Bundesbank injected 1.2 billion marks in extra funds at the weekly securities repurchase tender award.  </p>
<p>The majority of dealers predicted the Bundesbank would announce plans to leave the repo rate fixed at three percent for the next four weeks, spanning the time the council is on its traditional summer break.</p>
<p>As the Bundesbank has kept the money market rate steady for almost one year now, analysts and dealers said they saw no signals to indicate the Bundesbank might be ready to alter its steady hand policy.</p>
<p>Although policy makers might not be celebrating the mark's steady depreciation of recent weeks, dealers said they would probably stand by, leaving foreign exchange markets alone.  </p>
<p>"The Bundesbank is very unlikely to adjust the repo rate in order to influence the impact a weaker mark might be having," one dealer said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday three German states released slightly higher than expected monthly inflation statistics which suggested to some economists that the mark's softer level was filtering through to import prices.</p>
<p>But economists also agreed that inflation was, on the whole, still largely under control in Germany, obviating the need for the Bundesbank to quickly nudge interest rates higher to ward off looming inflationary pressures.  </p>
<p>"I do not think the Bundesbank would be well served by reverting to variable repo rate which could well send interest rates higher and threaten Germany's fragile economic recovery," Holger Fahrinkrug, senior Germany economist at UBS in Frankfurt said.</p>
<p>Similarly an outright repo rate hike, by for example maintaining the fixed system but raising the rate, would also unnerve markets and be rather counterproductive, dealers and analysts agreed.</p>
<p>"In the end there is little the Bundesbank could do or would do," one dealer said.  </p>
<p>Banks holdings at the Bundesbank stood at 42.6 billion marks on Wednesday compared with 41.6 billion marks on day earlier. The monthly average rate was at 41 billion marks, and dealers were mostly comfortable with their holding.</p>
<p>The Frankfurt Interbank Overnight Average  FIONA= was set at 3.02800 on Thursday compares with 3.03200 on Wednesday.</p>
