<p>---------------------MARKET COMMENT--------------------------</p>
<p>* Canada's dollar opened weaker at C$1.3786 (US$0.7253) in light trading on Friday as investors sold the unit ahead of U.S. economic data due to be released today, traders said.</p>
<p>* They said the Canada dollar also weakened on the back of a move by the Bank of England to raise interest rates by 25 basis points.  </p>
<p>Smaller-than-expected numbers would point to a slowdown in the U.S. economy, while higher numbers would help the U.S. Federal Reserve press its case for an interest rate hike to ward off inflation.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee could spike interest rates at its next July 1-2 meeting.</p>
<p>"People are selling Canada (dollar) before the payrolls numbers. There is still a predisposition in this market to thinking that the Americans are going to get a hot number, which would point to Fed activity in July," said Reid Farrill, corporate foreign exchange adviser for CIBC Wood Gundy.  </p>
<p>Canada released unemployment data earlier this morning showing a small drop in the unemployment rate to 9.5 percent in May from 9.6 percent in April. The decrease was in line with a Reuters survey of economists forecast.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada also reported that full-time employment rose by 61,300 in May, compared with an increase of 33,000 in April.</p>
<p>Traders, however, said the numbers would not be enough to fuel a Canada dollar rally on its own.</p>
<p>"The Canadian dollar can't really do much ahead of the U.S. data," one trader said.  </p>
<p>Traders said the Canada dollar also weakened on the back of a move by the Bank of England to raise interest rates by 25 basis points.</p>
<p>The bank said that recent economic data had not changed the view that it took in its inflation report last month that "on present evidence," there is likely to be a need for some further moderate tightening of policy in the months ahead.</p>
<p>On the crosses, the Canadian dollar was flat at 83.94 yen from Thursday's close and increased to 1.2609 marks from Thursday's 1.2544 marks.</p>
