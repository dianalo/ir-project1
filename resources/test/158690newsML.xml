<p>Mondragon International Phils Inc said on Thursday it planned to spin off its consumer products division and concentrate on gaming and leisure development as its core business.</p>
<p>The firm said in a statement the major shareholder of Mondragon, Jose Antonio Gonzalez, has agreed to buy the firm's consumer products division.</p>
<p>"This action will free Mondragon of a business that is performing below expectations, and enable the company to concentrate its efforts in its more lucrative lines, namely gaming and leisure," the statement said.  </p>
<p>Mondragon operates a hotel and casino at the Clark economic zone in northern Luzon island.</p>
<p>The firm said it posted a 92.2 percent rise in net income in the first nine months of the year to 323 million pesos from the year-ago 168 million pesos despite a 54-million peso loss from its consumer products division.</p>
<p>"Increasing competition in the apparel and cosmetics markets, particularly due to the stepped up efforts of multinational direct-selling companies, point to a less rosy picture for this portion of Mondragon's business."</p>
<p>Mondragon said the Gonzalez family agreed to buy the firm's consumer products division to improve the profitability of the company.</p>
<p>"A fair valuation of the business will be conducted by highly reputable and independent appraisers to determine the selling price (of the division to be spun off)," Mondragon said.</p>
