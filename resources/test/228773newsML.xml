<p>Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing on Monday stressed once again the German central bank's belief in the importance of strict fiscal discipline to the single currency project.</p>
<p>"Solid state finances are in themselves an expression of, and precondition for, political stability, At the same time they are also an essential counterpart to monetary stability," Issing told a bankers' forum.</p>
<p>He also said one of the possible effects of the approach of the single currency union was a shift out of the deutschemark into dollar-denominated investments, a comment which helped boost the dollar against the mark in late trading.</p>
<p>Uncertainty about the Euro's stability might prompt some shifting of assets, Issing said, stressed however that he considered this scenario to be only one of several options.</p>
<p>"On the one hand, shifts out of mark deposits into dollar investments are possible - many believe this will apply particularly to the introduction phase, when the reputation of the Euro is still being built up," Issing said.</p>
<p>Later when asked to comment directly on the dollar, Issing declined to be more specific.</p>
<p>Referring to plans for a stability pact, which would assure lasting stability within the currency union, Issing said that Germany has insisted the pact's content must take precedence over any sort of time pressure to complete negotiations.</p>
<p>Issing told Reuters Financial Television: " Germany insists that content (when it comes to a stability pact) is more important than time."</p>
<p>France and Germany are also currently not at odds over the stability pact, Issing said, adding he expected two countries would ultimately agree on the details of formulating the structures of a tough stability package.</p>
<p>Any exemptions from the pact must be clearly formulated to prevent the pact from later falling victim to political wrangling, Issing said.</p>
<p>When asked about French calls for Germany to lower its interest rates further, Issing said that there were currently "no changes in opinion between the two central banks."</p>
<p>At the same time Issing said capital market rates, already at all-time lows, could still move lower, if people are truly convinced that inflationary dangers are dead.</p>
<p>"If one has declared inflation to be dead and one were not to expect inflation to be resurrected, then one could possibly see lower nominal rates (at the long-end of the market)."</p>
<p>Commenting on another one of Germany's key suggestions for the currency union, that the future European central bank use a money supply target, Issing acknowledged that although Germany has missed the target recently, it was still valid.</p>
<p>"In the longer-term we are on target," he said, adding that M3, the Bundesbank's key policy instrument, was still a useful indicator. Over an average three year period, M3 is running at an average 5.5 percent, he said.</p>
<p>Issing also said the Bundesbank will need to take into consideration that the mark will effectively only live for another two years when formulating its next money supply target this month.</p>
<p>While the Bundesbank has traditionally set a one year target, several independent economists have suggested a longer-dated target, as the central bank would have a greater chance of meeting the target then.</p>
