<p>The Venezuelan bolivar closed slightly firmer at 467.75/477.75 per dollar Wednesday compared with 477.25/478.25 per dollar Tuesday, after the Central Bank intervened heavily to meet strong demand for foreign currency, traders said.</p>
<p>Quiet trading in the morning suddenly turned hectic as a series of rumors regarding instability in the country began to circulate.</p>
<p>"The session was full of all sorts of rumors," one trader said.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Jose Guillermo Andueza appealed to Venezuelans Wednesday to ignore a wave of rumors, which he said were baseless. He did not say what the rumors were.</p>
<p>In the afternoon "demand tripled and the Central Bank was active," another trader said.</p>
<p>"If the Central Bank had not intervened the rate would have shot up," he added.</p>
<p>Traders said the markets would be closely watching to President Rafael Caldera's annual address to legislators Thursday morning for any announcements which would calm market nerves.</p>
