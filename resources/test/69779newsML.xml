<p>Revco D.S. Inc said it remains committed to its offer to acquire Big B Inc for $15 a share, despite Big B's recommended rejection of the offer and adoption of a shareholder rights plan that would make the deal more difficult to complete.</p>
<p>"We remain committed to completing a combination of Revco and Big B," the company said in a statement. "We are confident the shareholders of Big B -- the owners of the company -- will recognize the superior value of our offer."</p>
<p>Revco said it will review the terms of Big B's rights plan and its board's recommendations to devise future actions.  </p>
<p>Big B has approximately 22 million shares on a fully diluted basis, giving Big B a value of $330 million based on Revco's bid.</p>
<p>Revco said it currently owns 1,190 shares of Big B, representing 5.4 percent of Big B's shares on a fully diluted basis.</p>
<p>Big B said earlier today that Revco's bid is "inadequate from a financial point of view." Big B said it is reviewing its alternatives to boost shareholder value.</p>
