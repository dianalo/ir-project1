<p>Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah on Tuesday accepted the government's resignation after parliamentary elections on Monday in which opposition deputies lost their majority in the house.</p>
<p>An official statement read on state radio said the emir accepted the resignation, in line with the constitution.</p>
<p>The emir has not yet said who would head the new government but Crown Prince Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah is widely expected to once again form and head the next cabinet, analysts said.</p>
<p>An emiri decree invited the new parliament to hold its first session on October 20.</p>
<p>Election results for 50 seats showed that pro-government candidates emerged as the main winners in Monday's vote, enabling the next cabinet to muster a majority in the house.</p>
<p>The outgoing house was dominated by opposition politicians who opened wide probes into alleged official corruption and kept a close eye on state spending.</p>
