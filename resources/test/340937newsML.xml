<p>U.S. spot products prices soared late Wednesday tracking NYMEX futures and steady to firmer diffs, with jet fuel prices gaining as much as 3.5 cents a gallon amid continued refiner buying, traders said.</p>
<p>New York Harbor heating oil saw diffs firm about 0.20 cent to 0.10 cent over February futures. Gulf Coast material was stable at about 3.40 cents below the print, traders said, although absolute prices jumped as February futures settled 2.01 cents higher.</p>
<p>Diffs on U.S. Gulf aviation-quality 54-grade fuel leaped to 2.25 cents over the print late afternoon, 1.5 cents firmer than Tuesday diffs, traders said.</p>
<p>"There's no question they're stronger. It looks like a few people are caught short," one Gulf player said, noting today is the scheduling deadline for nominating front-third-cycle material for delivery on the Colonial Pipeline.</p>
<p>Gulf traders said Exxon, Koch Oil, Citgo and Conoco had all been seeking third-cycle 54-grade barrels earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Some players cited unconfirmed rumors of refinery output problems, while others ascribed growing differential strength to crimped supplies brought on by ongoing refinery maintenance turnarounds in the Gulf.</p>
<p>NYH 54-grade jet was talked as high as 5.0 cents over the print, a half cent firmer than Tuesday, while 55-grade saw diffs firm over one cent with deals done at 6.75 cents over, players said.</p>
<p>NYH conventional unleaded "M5" gasoline saw diffs hold stedy at about 1.25 cents below the print, with Gulf "M4" conventional unleaded offered at 1.85 cents below the print.</p>
<p>"I think 'M5' has a little room to slide," one East Coast trader said, citing "a whole list of cargoes" now arriving or en route from Europe.</p>
<p>NYH reformulated "A5" grade gasoline diffs were stuck at about even with the print, traders said.</p>
