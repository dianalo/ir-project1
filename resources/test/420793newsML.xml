<p>A flood of rumours, leaks and media reports indicated on Wednesday that President Boris Yeltsin has decided to give a key cabinet post to his liberal ally Anatoly Chubais at the risk of angering the opposition.</p>
<p>Kremlin sources privately confirmed media reports saying that, barring a last minute rethink, the government would be reshuffled and Chubais become the first deputy to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>Such a dramatic move is in Yeltsin's combative character and would be a defiant way of marking his return to the helm of power after months of illness with heart problems and pneumonia.</p>
<p>Presidential spokesmen have declined to say who might be promoted or fired. "Tomorrow the prime minister will say everything," a Kremlin spokesman said.</p>
<p>"This is a question for the president and not for me," Chernomyrdin, smiling broadly, told reporters in parliament when asked about Chubais' possible appointment.</p>
<p>Yeltsin delivers a state of the nation address to a joint session of two parliamentary chambers on Thursday at 0800 GMT. At 1200 GMT, Chernomyrdin presides over an expanded government meeting.</p>
<p>The announcement of a cabinet reshuffle may be made at any of the two meetings, or a few days later, Kremlin sources say.</p>
<p>The daily newspaper Sevodnya said Chubais would bring a number of allies into the cabinet. Other newspapers and news agencies suggested other changes.</p>
<p>But the essence was clear -- the cabinet would be restructured to increase its effectiveness and diminish the role of industrial lobbies, and Chubais would be the key figure in the government.</p>
<p>The reshuffle is expected also to reduce the role of the Kremlin administration which critics say has become a parallel government under Chubais' influence.</p>
<p>Some experts immediately said such a reshuffle would free Chernomyrdin's hand from everyday running of the economy and allow him to become Yeltsin's heir-apparent for the presidential election in 2000. Chubais would be free to pursue reforms.</p>
<p>The highly unpopular Chubais, 41, does not seem to have any direct presidential ambitions but he is widely seen as a potential kingmaker with immense power.</p>
<p>Nothing could have enraged the opposition-dominated lower chamber of parliament more.</p>
<p>The opposition hate the "Iron Chubais", a talented organiser and administrator, for his privatisation campaign in 1992-1996 which they see as a cheap sell-off. They also despise him for his pivotal role in Yeltsin's re-election campaign in 1996.</p>
<p>"We have already said that the transfer of Chubais to the post of the first vice-premier would be spitting in the face of society again," Valentin Kuptsov, number two in the Communist Party, told reporters in the State Duma.</p>
<p>"Chernomyrdin will be put aside, all functions will pass to Chubais and this will lead to a worsening of relations between the president and parliament."</p>
<p>The Duma cannot stop Yeltsin from appointing Chubais but Kuptsov indicated the communists could press for a no-confidence vote in the government as a whole.</p>
<p>Such a move would give Yeltsin the choice of disbanding either the government or the Duma itself.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, clearly angry with the Duma over its attempts to force him out of office for health reasons, has already said he would be ready to "kick back".</p>
<p>He may also hope that the resolve of Chubais could help overcome two important economic problems -- non-payment of taxes and delayed salaries and wages.</p>
<p>The West is sure to hail a new role for Chubais. He is trusted by the likes of the International Monetary Fund and the Group of Seven industrial nations and he is capable of reviving confidence that reforms in Russia continue and are not stalled.  </p>
<p>Yeltsin's speech at 11 a.m. (0800 GMT) on Thursday will be based on but not identical to the written address issued to legislators.</p>
<p>The president said economic crime had gone beyond the realm of a simple matter for the police to challenge the whole structure of democratic, free market reforms that Yeltsin has implemented since the collapse of Soviet communism in 1991.</p>
<p>"When free buying and selling extends to the passing of laws, to the work of civil servants and to court decisions, it is not just immoral but a mortal danger to society and the state," Yeltsin said in an address short on specific measures.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 66, has been ill for the first eight months of his second term. Kremlin sources say he is likely to name liberal economist Anatoly Chubais, his chief-of-staff, to a powerful new government post with sweeping powers to implement a clean-up campaign to save reforms from the criminal threat.</p>
