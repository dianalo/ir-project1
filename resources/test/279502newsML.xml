<p>China's improving economic outlook is set to boost interest in China-related shares in 1997, leading to a rash of red-chip and China-concept IPOs ahead of Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule, analysts said.</p>
<p>"We are optimistic and positive over the sentiment and conditions of the (stock and initial public offering) markets in 1997," said Patrick Cheng, corporate finance director at HSBC Investment Bank. "It is possible that many more H-shares or red chips will come into the Hong Kong market."</p>
<p>Analysts said the Chinese government was likely to push quality red-chip companies to list in Hong Kong as well as on China's Shenzhen and Shanghai exchanges.</p>
<p>"Hong Kong is one of the biggest and nearest windows for Chinese enterprises to raise capital due to its high market liquidity," said Kinson Au, senior analyst at PW Asia Brokerage.</p>
<p>"It is also a way for the Chinese government to show its support for one country two systems after the handover."</p>
<p>After Hong Kong reverts to China in mid-1997, it will become an autonomous Chinese "Special Administrative Region", allowed to keep its capitalist economic system for a further 50 years.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Hang Seng index was expected to continue rallying in 1997, providing an ideal listing environment. "I think there will be an increase both in the amount of funds raised and the number of issues in 1997 especially during the first half of 1997," said ASG Investment analyst Michael Ng.</p>
<p>Although no significant changes are expected in Hong Kong's listing rules after Britain hands the territory back to China at midnight next June 30, he said many firms were rushing to list ahead of that date in case of any changes.</p>
<p>With companies queueing up to list, some offerings due this year were likely to take place in 1997, analysts said.</p>
<p>"As the 1997 issue is seen to be the main global focus next year, it will attract more international attention to Hong Kong," said Cheng.</p>
<p>He said investors were showing confidence in prospects after the 1997 handover and pointed to the strength seen this year in the Hong Kong property market.</p>
<p>Investors' attentions are likely to turn towards smaller cap issues going forward, following the strong blue chip rally of 1996, with the strong performance of recent IPOs raising interest in that segment of the market, analysts said.</p>
<p>"As long as the market continues to perform as it is, you will see small capitalisation companies continue to come to the market," said SOCGEN-Crosby senior economist Clive McDonnell.</p>
<p>A continued trend towards spinoffs in Hong Kong would also boost the number of new listings next year, analysts said.</p>
<p>As of December 13, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange said 43 companies had listed in 1996, including five China-incorporated companies which issued H-shares, four red chip firms and 10 spinoffs, raising about HK$29.07 billion.</p>
<p>In 1995, there were 26 new listings, comprising two H-share listings and three red-chips, raising HK$7.64 billion.</p>
<p>Among China-related issues, those linked to infrastructure were expected to continue attracting a following due to huge demand for roads, bridges and power plants in China.</p>
<p>"The infrastructure sector is expected to be hot in 1997 due to the encouraging performance of infrastructure stocks like New World Infrastructure and Cheung Kong Infrastructure," said Au.</p>
