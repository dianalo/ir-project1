<p>Banks expect liquidity on the money market, long on the surplus side, would shrink this year, shifting the focus of open market operations from reverse repos to repos, a Reuter poll of Poland's 25 biggest banks showed.</p>
<p>Banks predicted the National Bank of Poland's 14-day revrepo rate, last at 21.64 percent, would fall to 18.15 percent by year-end. The forecast is a mean average of banks' predictions ranging from 16.20 to 20.75 percent.</p>
<p>Banks expected the reverse repo rate to ease to 21.53 percent on average this month and to 17.70 percent in January 1998.</p>
<p>However, six of the polled banks did not expect the central bank to stage such operations at the end of the year predicting it would rather do repos.</p>
<p>Six banks expected the central bank would do both repos and reverse repos at the end of 1997 and six expected the NBP would stage only repo operations.</p>
<p>The repo rate at the end of 1997 was seen at 18.56 percent on average with a range of predictions from 16.5 to 21.5 percent.</p>
<p>The rate was seen at 22.17 percent on average this month with a range of 20.15 to 24.5 percent and falling to 18.15 percent in 12 months time -- in January 1998 within a range of 16 to 21.5 percent.</p>
