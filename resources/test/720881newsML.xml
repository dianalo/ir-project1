<p>September notionnel futures traded on MATIF are set for a move lower on Thursday and will head towards the 130.00 region, technical anlaysts said.</p>
<p>"Everything has been overbought on a daily basis for a while and this looks to be the first reasonably significant break lower," said Jim Dodgin, senior technical anlayst at Technical Data in London.</p>
<p>"If we go through 130.30, then we are looking at 130.00 and beyond," he said.</p>
<p>At 0742 GMT September notionnel futures were at 130.46, down 26 basis points on the day.  </p>
<p>"We have had so many consecutive up days that we have come too far and may need to correct lower," Dodgin said.</p>
<p>The fact that the contract had traded up against the top of a Bollinger band for the last nine days also made a move lower almost inevitable, he said.</p>
<p>Bollinger bands are lines drawn around price action, acting as support and resistance, based on standard deviations.</p>
<p>Further support was offered by a trendline which currently comes in around 129.64, Dodgin said.</p>
<p>"Through there then we are in trouble," he said.  </p>
<p>Technical analysts at Chase in London said the break lower would trigger a correction back to six-week channel support at 129.84, ahead of medium term key support at 129.58/52.</p>
<p>"Any break below here will weaken the near term outlook targeting 129.02 and then critical support at 128.82 and 128.42," they said in a research note.</p>
<p>To the upside, Dodgin saw resistance at 130.70, the  high so far this session.</p>
<p>"In the unlikely event of that giving way, there is 130.88 which is the contract high made yesterday," he said.</p>
<p>At the short end, September Pibor was at 96.53, down 0.05.</p>
