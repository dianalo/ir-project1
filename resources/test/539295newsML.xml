<p>CBOT soybean futures ended sharply higher on Friday, led by nearby months, on talk China had purchased U.S. soybeans, traders said.</p>
<p>"The talk of the Chinese interest in the U.S. beans gave the funds a reason to reload long positions," said John Kleist, director of agricultural research for ING Futures and Options. "Half of it could be tied to fundamentals and half of it to the technicals."</p>
<p>U.S. export sources said China appeared to have bought at least one cargo of U.S. soybeans and possibly two more on Thursday night.</p>
<p>But some exporters said the sale made little economic sense since Brazilian prices were below U.S. values. Still, some floor sources cited "reliability of supply", saying China needed prompt shipment and could not wait for Brazilian soybean shipments which have been delayed several times this year due to strikes and weather.</p>
<p>Technical indicators also played a part in the rally with the July contract powering through resistance at $8.54 per bushel and the 20-day moving average at $8.53, chartists said.</p>
<p>Soybeans ended 20-3/4 to 3-3/4 cents per bushel higher with May up 20-3/4 at $8.67-3/4.  </p>
<p>"The fundamentals have been bullish for a while," a veteran floor trader said. "Now the technicians have given up on the downside and they're bullish, too."</p>
<p>Funds were aggressive buyers on the day, led by Refco Inc with at least 10 million bushels, traders said.</p>
<p>The July/November spread snapped back, gaining 16-1/2 cents per bushel on the day, premium July, to close at $1.69-1/2. Analysts and traders pointed to strong old crop demand and expectations for large new crop acreage.</p>
<p>"The bull spreads will continue to work as long as soybean crush and export sales continue to run over 30 million bushels," said Joel Karlin, analyst with Everen Securities in Chicago. "It's that simple. The talk of China was friendly and last night's crush wasn't too bad."</p>
<p>The National Oilseed Processors Association on Thursday put weekly soybean crushings at 25.64 million bushels, in line with trade ideas. But analysts said the crush needs to fall below 25 million bushels to ensure adequate year-end supplies.</p>
<p>Cash sources also said processors and exporters were competing for limited supplies and both U.S. Gulf CIF and processor bids were firming.</p>
<p>In options trade, Continental Grain bought 600 July $8.75 calls and sold 600 July $9.75 calls at 18-3/4 to 20 cents.</p>
<p>Soybean futures volume was estimated by CBOT at 75,000 contracts, compared with Thursday's actual volume of 58,830.</p>
