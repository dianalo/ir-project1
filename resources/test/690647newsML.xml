<p>China is an increasingly key importer of copper concentrates, but shipping material there can mean higher risk and difficulty obtaining payments, analyst Malcolm Southwood of stockbrokers J.B. Were and Son said on Thursday.</p>
<p>China had a growing dependence on imported copper, with a preference for raw materials, and planned to further increase smelting and refining capacity, he told the Metal Bulletin Base Metals Concentrates conference.</p>
<p>China's imports of concentrates were estimated at 180,000 tonnes this year and were seen rising to 310,000 in 2000, he said.</p>
<p>Western concentrate production was seen increasing sharply as new mines and expansions came on stream, and Chinese smelters would help absorb some of the excess.</p>
<p>"Some of the newer mine producers are likely to send a higher proportion of their output to 'newer destinations' including China. And as such, these newcomers to the market will in turn have higher risk profiles than longer-established participants," Southwood said.</p>
<p>Insurance premiums for shipments to China were typically 10-25 percent higher than premiums for metal destined for traditional Western destinations, he said.</p>
<p>Obtaining payments for gold recovered at Chinese refineries from copper concentrate also posed difficulties, with no easy resolution seen in the near term.</p>
<p>Gold produced by Chinese smelters had to be sold to the Bank of China at a domestic gold price that was typically $30 below the international price. The bank could also take up to six months to pay for the gold, he added.</p>
<p>Although the regulations were unlikely to change for the time being, merchants could apply for a special export licence for gold to sell it on the international market at Western prices.</p>
<p>"The next logical step would be the granting of an ongoing special export licence to cover a series of contracted concentrate deliveries from a specific source," he said.</p>
<p>Producers would also be looking eventually to deal directly with Chinese buyers rather than through a broker, he added.</p>
<p>"As Chinese demand for Western concentrates rises, accompanied by an increase in Western dependence on Chinese smelters, it can only be a matter of time before long-term supply contracts become a regular feature," he said.</p>
