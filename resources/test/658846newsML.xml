<p>The union representing British Columbia lumber workers said on Friday it might consider taking a strike vote in July if it is not satisified with the pace of contract negotiations by then.</p>
<p>"I want an agreement finished by the end of July," Dave Haggard, president of the IWA-Canada union, said in an interview.</p>
<p>If there was not a "very, very clear" indication of progress by early July, the union would consider a strike vote, he said. The workers' current agreement expires on Saturday.</p>
<p>The union and Forest Industrial Relations, the bargaining agent for 65 coastal forestry companies, met this week to go over their demands. Haggard said the union asked the companies to put forward a contract offer when they meet again next Wednesday.</p>
<p>But he doubted a full offer would be forthcoming. More likely the companies would present their positions on selected issues, he said.</p>
<p>The union has presented 35 demands and while it had not dropped any, it signaled its priorities, Haggard said.</p>
<p>But the workers are adamant that the contract will entail some increased costs for the companies. "The industry...has to get off this idea of a no-cost agreement," he said.</p>
<p>Keith Bennett, chief negotiator for the companies, said the talks were progressing normally with "no surprises, no threats." The two sides had narrowed down the range of issues in talks so far, he said.</p>
<p>The talks had moved at a quicker pace so far than in some previous contract negotiations, but that did not necessarily mean an agreement would be reached more quickly than in the past, he said.</p>
<p>In talks between workers in northern British Columbia, damage claims made by three companies against an IWA local over work stoppages have become an issue.</p>
<p>"We've made it pretty clear to them that there will be no collective agreement unless these damage claims are resolved," said Harvey Arcand, chair of the union's northern negotiating committee.</p>
<p>The union said another contentious issue in both the coastal and interior talks was an industry suggestion "that they can recover company pension contributions.</p>
<p>"I hope they aren't serious about that one or it's going to be a long, hot summer in 1997," said Arcand.</p>
