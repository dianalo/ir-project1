<p>The Ukrainian government has asked parliament to abolish the death penalty to avoid "disgracing ourselves before the whole world", Justice Minister Serhiy Holovaty said on Friday.</p>
<p>"Our proposal calls for a moratorium on executions, and life sentences as an alternative to the death penalty," Holovaty, a prominent abolition advocate, told a news conference.</p>
<p>"Abolishing the death penalty is not a popular move with Ukrainians, but disgracing ourselves before the whole world would be even more unpopular."</p>
<p>The Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly on Wednesday threatened to lock out Russian and Ukrainian delegates unless they quickly honoured commitments to halt executions and abolish the death penalty within three years.</p>
<p>Holovaty expressed concern that the assembly's resolution would lead to Ukrainian authorities concealing executions from the public -- or even from his justice ministry.</p>
<p>President Leonid Kuchma and his government could face a difficult task convincing Ukrainians that scrapping the death penalty was a good thing -- opinion polls show that less than 10 percent of the 52 million population are in favour of the move.</p>
<p>But Ukraine pledged to stop executions in November 1995 when it joined the 40-nation Council, set up after World War Two to promote human rights and democracy.</p>
<p>Kuchma, on a visit to Paris, said Ukraine had to try to avoid stirring up passions over a highly emotive issue. "I'm in favour of abolishing the death penalty but I'm against revolutionary fervour," he said.</p>
<p>"Public opinion is often very unfavourable. In Belgium, people are talking of reviving the death penalty because truly awful crimes have been committed recently," he told a news conference, referring to killings of children by paedophiles.</p>
<p>Holovaty said he hoped Ukraine's parliament would vote for the law before the Council of Europe's next parliamentary session in April.</p>
<p>Ukraine executed 89 people in the first half of 1996, Holovaty said, but he had no information on executions in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>The law allows for execution by shooting for treason and some murder cases, a far cry from Soviet days when you could be executed for 36 crimes, including some thefts.</p>
<p>Police data show 4,896 people were murdered in Ukraine last year, 2.4 percent more than in 1995.</p>
<p>Kiev officials said last year the country was not obliged to stop executions immediately, and had only to move in that direction.</p>
<p>Council of Europe officials said some 15 of its 40 members, including Belgium and Britain, had not formally abolished the death penalty but had imposed moratoriums on executions.</p>
