<p>The European Commission adopted a communication on Wednesday opening consultations with the social partners on how to improve the social dialogue.</p>
<p>"The suggestions for reform in this communication are aimed at a rationalisation of structures and an optimal allocation of the resources available," Social Affairs Commissioner Padraig Flynn was quoted as saying in a statement.</p>
<p>The paper, the Commission said in a statement, was aimed at adapting the social dialogue to the major policy changes facing the European Union.</p>
<p>The Commission is seeking views by the end of the year, after which it will submit a second communication in 1997.</p>
