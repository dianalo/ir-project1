<headline>Russian sauna scandal ex-minister says he innocent.</headline>

<p>Russia's former Justice Minister, sacked after the publication of pictures allegedly showing him with naked women in a gangland sauna, said on Thursday he was confident that an investigation would uphold his innocence.</p>
<p>"I consider that these materials are false and uncorroborated and believe the truth will be established," Valentin Kovalyov told Ekho Moskvy radio in his first interview since being sacked by President Boris Yeltsin on July 2.</p>
<p>The unprecedented scandal broke last month after a newspaper printed grainy photographs of a video film purportedly showing him relaxing in a steam room with several unidentified naked women in September 1995.</p>
<p>The publication said it was a sauna frequented by a powerful criminal gang.</p>
<p>Television stations later screened excerpts of the tape. Kovalyov says the tape was faked but Interior Ministry officials have said it is genuine.</p>
<p>Media attention in the Kovalyov affair focused on the intrigues that may have been behind the release of the film rather than on the minister's behaviour.</p>
<p>Kovalyov said on Thursday that his main aim was to clear his name and to find out who had authorised the release of the tape.</p>
<p>"I want to look (that person) in the eyes, and I don't exclude that it will be in court...If he can prove the authenticity of the information he leaked then I shall quit (public life) in shame," the 53-year-old lawyer said.</p>
<p>He said he would not sue the journalist who broke the story in the weekly Sovershenno Sekretno (Top Secret) because he had nothing to do with the tape in question and she had therefore not infringed on his right to privacy.</p>
<p>"I have nothing to justify to anyone," he said.</p>
<p>He said that prior to the scandal he had been working on plans to expand the powers of the Justice Ministry, partly at the expense of the Interior Ministry, but said he did not believe this had any link with the release of the tape.</p>
<p>Despite widespread corruption and deep public mistrust of politicians in post-Soviet Russia sex scandals are very rare.</p>
<p>Many politicians reacted to the scandal with shows of solidarity with Kovalyov. Ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky said the press could use the newspaper revelations to start a witch-hunt.</p>
<p>The Kremlin gave no detailed explanation for the decision to sack Kovalyov, who had originally been suspended at his own request while he cleared his name.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov said Yeltsin had known of the film, seized during a probe into a banker charged with theft, as early as April, more than a month before the scandal broke in public.</p>
<p>But Kovalyov told Ekho Moskvy radio that he himself first knew of the tape only after the pictures were published and added that he had not been approached beforehand to give an explanation of the affair.</p>
<p>Kovalyov's successor at the Justice Ministry is Sergei Stepashin, a former security service chief sacked in 1995 for mishandling a hostage-taking crisis near breakaway Chechnya.</p>
