<p>President Fidel Ramos said on Wednesday the Philippines had agreed to provide temporary haven to top North Korean defector Hwang Jang-yop but stressed his stay would be "as short as possible".</p>
<p>Ramos, speaking at a news conference, broke official silence over Hwang's presence in the Philippines but refused to shed light on the mystery of his whereabouts.</p>
<p>"The security of our visitor is of paramount importance," Ramos said.</p>
<p>A special presidential task force has kept Hwang in a secret hideaway since he arrived on Tuesday, officials said, amid fears the 73-year-old chief North Korean ideologue could be a target of Pyongyang assassins.</p>
<p>"After consultations with concerned countries, the Philippines decided to allow the temporary stay of Mr Hwang only for as long as necessary and as short as possible," said Ramos, reading from a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Hwang arrived at nearby Clark air base on Tuesday from China, where he had been marooned in South Korea's embassy in Beijing since seeking asylum there on February 12.</p>
<p>Ramos refused to say when Hwang would be flown to South Korea. Security sources earlier said Hwang's stay in the Philppines could last up to a week.</p>
<p>Ramos said the decision to shelter Hwang "was based on our desire to be of help to our neighbours in their need for third country facilities and to ease tension in the Korean peninsula."</p>
<p>"(This) would ensure the continued peace and stability of the Asia-Pacific region," Ramos added.</p>
<p>Asked why the Philippines was chosen to shelter Hwang before he flies to Seoul, Ramos said in jest: "Maybe because we are hospitable, may be because we are peaceful and maybe because we are more attractive, but that is just a guess."</p>
<p>Foreign undersecretary Rodolfo Severino said Manila would still have to negotiate with Seoul how long Hwang would stay in the Philippines.</p>
<p>He said Hwang already had a South Korean passport.</p>
<p>Security has been tightened at Clark, 80 km (50 miles) north of Manila, amid reports Hwang might fly out sooner than expected.</p>
<p>Guards turned away reporters who tried to get into the airport, saying they were on a security rehearsal.</p>
<p>North Korea has a history of deadly attacks against its arch-rival South Korea. The two Koreas are still frozen in Cold War confrontation.</p>
<p>Just three days after Hwang sought asylum in Beijing, a prominent North Korean defector was fatally shot near Seoul. The victim, Li Il-nam, was a nephew of the former wife of North Korean leader Kim Jong-il.</p>
<p>Ramos's refusal to give the slightest hint on where Hwang was being kept deepened the mystery over the whereabouts of the highest North Korean official to flee the Stalinist state, and spurred a flurry of rumours.</p>
<p>Military officers said on Tuesday that military helicopters flew Hwang and his party to the northern mountain city of Baguio after the group flew into the former U.S. Clark airbase. But Baguio officials said they were unaware of his presence.</p>
<p>Another officer said Hwang was flown to Manila.</p>
<p>Checks on the presidential summer house, hotels, a South Korean church, a resort facility and places where South Koreans normally gather in Baguio failed to yield any trace of Hwang.</p>
<p>A defence department officer said he believed Hwang was being kept at the armed forces intelligence compound in Manila's Camp Aguinaldo but this could not be verified.</p>
<p>The officer said military intelligence chief Major-General Benjamin Libarnes was directing the operation and reporting directly to Ramos.</p>
