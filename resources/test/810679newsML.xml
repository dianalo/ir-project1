<p>Britain's Kelly Holmes, the fastest woman over 1,500 metres this year and one of the gold medal favourites, failed to finish her opening round heat on the first day of the world championships on Saturday.</p>
<p>Holmes, whose Olympic prospects were ruined by injury last year, pulled up after only 160 metres of the race and sat on the track in obvious pain.</p>
<p>She then limped around the track after the race was finished before disappearing into the tunnel at the end of the home straight.</p>
<p>Medical officials said Holmes had injured her left Achilles tendon.</p>
<p>"She is in real pain, believe me, she is in tears in the treatment room," one official said.</p>
