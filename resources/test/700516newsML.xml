<title>AUSTRALIA: INSTANT VIEW - Australian May trade data.</title>
<headline>INSTANT VIEW - Australian May trade data.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-07-01</dateline>
<text>
<p>Australia's balance of trade in goods and services was a surplus of A$873 million in May, official figures on Tuesday show.</p>
<p>This compared with a surplus of A$182 million in April, and a median forecast of a A$163 million surplus. Forecasts ranged from a deficit of A$400 million to a A$500 million surplus.</p>
<p>A selection of economists' immediate reactions to the data follows.</p>
<p>DAVID DE GARIS, SENIOR TREASURY ECONOMIST, ANZ BANK:</p>
<p>"It was close to our own expectation of a A$300 million surplus, once you take the frigate out of calculations. This series is hard to pick from month to month. But it's clear exports are holding up pretty well given the previous appreciation of the currency, and imports are being restrained by poor domestic demand."  </p>
<p>STEPHEN ROBERTS, CHIEF ECONOMIST, UBS AUSTRALIA:</p>
<p>"Obviously, it's better than expected, (but) it's mainly a one-off. It makes it quite interesting for GDP in the June quarter because you're off to very much a flying start in the balance of goods and services in both April and May, so you're going to get a fairly strong net exports figure."  </p>
<p>CRAIG JAMES, SENIOR ECONOMIST, COLONIAL STATE BANK:</p>
<p>"The figure was better than expected but largely ignored by financial markets. While it is pleasing that Australia's trade situation improves, markets are more focussed on what the Reserve Bank is likely to do with monetary policy."  </p>
<p>ANNETTE BEACHER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, CITIBANK AUSTRALIA:</p>
<p>"I actually don't think it's particularly good news for the economy, because so much of our economy relies on imports. Imports have been so lousy over the last couple of months, it shows a pretty lacklustre economy. It's mixed, that's the problem, good exports sounds like a healthy economy but is it because what we're producing is bypassing the domestic economy and being shipped out the door?"  </p>
<p>TONY MEER, SENIOR ECONOMIST, DEUTSCHE MORGAN GRENFELL:</p>
<p>"If the monthly current account deficit had come in A$720 million better than what the market had been forcasting I think bond yields and the dollar would have rallied. But obviously noone really cares any more because we have changed the name of it (the data release). You would have to say in terms of the trend for the current account they are very positive and suggest that not only will we do better than the government's forecast of A$21 billion for the 1996/97 current account we will do substantially better, probably about A$17.5 billion or less which is a very good result. In terms of the monthly movement, the thing that struck me was the weakness in capital goods and intermediate goods imports, and they are things that tell you about activity."  </p>
