<p>* Volume expands to 26.374 bln from 17.056 bln pesos</p>

<p>Philippine interbank call loan rates rose sligthly on Monday to an average of 10.9375 from 10.8125 percent amid the covering of reserve positions for the weekend, traders said.</p>
<p>Done rates ranged from 11.375 to 10.78125 percent, with 31 lenders and 29 borrowers.</p>
<p>"The market would be sideways for the rest of the week, a dealer said.  </p>
<p>"Outflows and inflows are just about even," she added.</p>
<p>Though some 2.4 billion pesos of maturities had been expected early this week, it will be offset by some 2.0 billion pesos in payment for T-notes later in the week, she said.</p>
<p>In the secondary market for T-bills, trading was tepid as institutions awaited results of the primary T-bill auction later in the day, traders said.</p>
<p>"They (banks) think the rates at the secondary market are too low. They might have a chance of getting better rates at the auction," a dealer said.  </p>
<p>According to a Reuters survey of eight institutions, the three-month bills had offer rates of 11.25 to 11.475; the six months at 11.65 to 11.825; and the one year at 12.075 to 12.225.</p>
