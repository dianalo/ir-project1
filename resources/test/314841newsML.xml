<p>Malaysian rubber prices closed mixed in continued featureless trading due to lack of direction and fresh buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The market is flat. There's no activity," one dealer said, adding that there was no sign of consumers returning to the market soon.</p>
<p>Dealers said buyers appeared to have met most of their rubber requirements for the near term. But some buying interest could be seen after the Eid al-Fitr and Chinese Lunar New Year festivities in early February, when tapping stopped for nearly a week and put a strain on supply of latex to the market.  </p>
<p>At the close, February RSS1 buyer was quoted at 304 cents ($1.23) a kg by the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board, up half cent from Thursday. February SMR 20 buyer was down half cent at 299.50 cents ($1.21) a kg.</p>
<p>Traders offered the SMR 20 at 300 cents, SMR CV at 364, SMR L at 344, SMR 5 at 313, SMR 10 at 301 and drum latex FOB at 237.</p>
<p>The INRO five-day moving average was 235.38 Malaysian/Singapore cents per kg on Jan 16 against 236.08 on Jan 15. The daily indicator price was 234.73 versus 234.90.</p>
