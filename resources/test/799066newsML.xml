<p>The microscopic organism that leads to illness every year for thousands of people who eat undercooked ground beef has been reported for the first time in alfalfa sprouts, federal health officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said 108 people in Michigan and Virginia fell ill in June and July after eating alfalfa sprouts contaminated with E. coli bacteria.</p>
<p>"This is the first known E. coli O157:H7 outbreak related to alfalfa sprouts," CDC medical epidemiologist Dr. Roger Shapiro said. Health experts traced the contamination to a seed lot but said they did not know how the alfalfa seeds had become contaminated.</p>
<p>The CDC estimates that 10,000 to 20,000 people become infected with E. coli every year. Most cases of the foodborne illness occur when people eat undercooked ground beef or drink unpasteurized milk or sewage-contaminated water.</p>
<p>E. coli infection can cause severe bloody diarrhea and abdominal cramps. In most cases, people recover within five to 10 days. But the infection can cause life-threatening kidney failure in some children and the elderly.</p>
<p>The health agency said 60 people in southern and central Michigan and 48 people in Virginia contracted the foodborne illness. Almost half of them were hospitalized.</p>
<p>Since 1995 four outbreaks of salmonella infection have been linked to alfalfa sprouts in the United States. In Japan last year, about 6,000 people became ill from radish sprouts contaminated with E. coli.</p>
<p>"As we have found in previous salmonella outbreaks with alfalfa sprouts, even a small amount of contamination of the seed may lead to a large contamination of the final product," Shapiro said.</p>
