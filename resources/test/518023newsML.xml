<p>Gold 24 carat opened steady at 4,830 rupees per 10 gramme despite a slump in world prices which took the New York bullion market to a low of $337.50 an ounce, just above a 46-month low set earlier this year at $336.15. The New York market steadied at the close to end at 341.00/50.</p>
<p>In India there were limited arrivals and wedding season buying remained subdued, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Arrivals of imported gold remained low particularly from the Middle East due to approaching Id festival," they said.</p>
<p>"Arrivals will pickup next week," one broker said, adding that once supplies began flowing agin prices will go down.</p>
<p>Gold biscuit (116.50 gramme) opened steady at 56,500 rupees per piece after gaining 400 rupees on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The market was closed on Wednesday for Hindu festival.</p>
<p>Silver (.999) on the other hand opened 10 rupees higher at 6,990 rupees per kg against Tuesday's close of 6,980 rupees as gains in the world market prompted fresh speculative support while industrial buying was at low ebb during the early trade. Silver was up by 20 rupees per kg on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Fresh arrivals of imported silver is low and looking at the recovery in the world market local prices may bounce back further," said Mahavir Shah, a leading silver dealer. (Conversion $1=35.79 rupees)</p>
