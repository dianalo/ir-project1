<p>TransColorado Gas Transmission Co said it plans to move ahead with the second phase of the TransColorado Pipeline Project.</p>
<p>Construction will begin early in 1998, the pipeline said. It is equally owned by KN Energy Inc, El Paso Energy Corp and Questar Corp</p>
<p>The TransColorado Pipeline has been approved in its entirety by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.</p>
<p>It said pre-construction work began last week on the project, including engineering and design, environmental updates, and right-of-way and permit procurement.</p>
<p>The remainder of the TransColorado Pipeline is expected to be completed in time for the 1998-99 heating season.</p>
<p>Phase I of the TransColorado Pipeline Project was completed in December 1996 and has been providing access to New Mexico's Blanco Hub for northern San Juan Basin producers.</p>
<p>The pipeline said several contracts have been signed with suppliers since it began operation as a result of growth in demand for Rocky Mountain natural gas and the anticipated reduced transmission constraints that will result from the fully completed project.</p>
<p>"We are moving ahead with the TransColorado Pipeline Project because it will provide more opportunities for producers of natural gas on the Western Slope," the pipeline said in a statement.</p>
<p>Phase II of the TransColorado Pipeline will extend 265 miles north into Rio Blanco County, Colo., with its terminus about 25 miles east of Rangely, Colo.  It will have a capacity of 300 million cubic feet per day and will use 24-inch pipe.</p>
<p>Phase I included the construction of 22.5 miles of 24-inch diameter pipe, and 2.5 miles of 16-inch diameter pipe, extending from the Coyote Gulch plant in La Plata County to the Blanco Hub.</p>
<p>The Coyote Gulch Gas Treating Plant is a separate project that treats natural gas before it enters the pipeline.  It began operation in December 1996 and has a capacity of 120 million cubic feet per day.</p>
