<p>The Oman-India subsea natural gas pipeline project has not been abandoned, the chairman of India's leading natural gas company said.</p>
<p>"We are hopeful about it," C.R. Prasad, chairman and managing director of the state-run Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL) told a conference on deep water exploration on Saturday.</p>
<p>"A lot of technical issues are already resolved," he said.</p>
<p>"From our side it is not abandoned," Prasad said when asked about news reports that Oman had abandoned the project over technical considerations.</p>
<p>Oman had spent over $60 million in feasibility studies.</p>
<p>India was also pursuing the Iran-India gas pipeline project, Prasad said. GAIL is India's leading natural gas supplier.</p>
<p>A pipeline to bring gas from countries east of India was also being considered, he said.</p>
<p>"Against a demand of 200 million cubic metres of gas, we are supplying only 50 million," Prasad said. To bridge the gap, GAIL planned to build a multi-billion dollar network of liquified natural gas (LNG) terminals along the coast, he said.</p>
<p>Seventeen international firms has put in bids for building the terminals coming up along the eastern and western coast.  </p>
<p>Prasad said GAIL was joining hands with the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) and Indian Oil Corporation for deep water exploration off India's coast for oil and natural gas.</p>
<p>"ONGC has done extensive surveys of India's deep waters and some good prospects have emerged," he said without elaborating.</p>
<p>"I expect a sizeable future production to come from deep waters," Prasad told India's first deep water exploration seminar. -- Bombay newsroom +91-22-265 9000</p>
