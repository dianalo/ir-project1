<p>Three fishermen died when they fell into the sea as ice floes broke up in storms in Russia's Far East, Interfax news agency reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Rescue teams managed to save 13 others on Saturday from Amur Bay in the Vladivostok region, where they had been fishing through holes cut in the ice, it said.</p>
<p>The sport of ice fishing remains popular in Russia despite the dangers. Rescuers saved about 40 people from drifting ice on Lake Ladoga in northwestern Russia on Thursday and Friday.</p>
