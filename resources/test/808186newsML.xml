<headline>Slovenian SBI index eases, seen biding time.</headline>

<p>Slovenia's SBI share index eased for the third trading day on Tuesday and traders said the lack of foreign demand was likely to keep trading activity at a low ebb until September.</p>
<p>"Now we are facing a typical summer standstill. In September, when foreigners are expected to return, volumes and prices will increase," said Ales Novak, a trader at brokerage Ilirika.</p>
<p>The SBI index eased 0.35 percent or 5.60 points to 1,581.54.</p>
<p>Market participants said foreign activity is subdued as buyers seem to be waiting for prices to fall.</p>
<p>"Why should they (the foreigners) come to our market when they know that the market will come to them -- they know that they will be able to buy cheaper after a while," one broker said.</p>
<p>Overall 11 shares fell, eight rose and one was flat while eight were untraded. Turnover rose to 172.6 million tolars from 113.8 million.</p>
<p>Port operator Luka Koper was the most actively traded stock, falling 1.83 percent to 2,140 tolars on volume of 4,426 shares.</p>
<p>Issue C of drug maker Lek led decliners, tumbling 5.43 percent to 33,100 tolars on volume of only one share.</p>
<p>Brokerage Dadas was the top gainer, rising 3.68 percent to 9,010 tolars on volume of 123 shares.</p>
<p>Market participants said drug producer Lek and petrol trader Petrol were the leading shares on the market and would probably attract the eye of investors when foreign capital returns.</p>
<p>Lek closed 1.55 percent lower at 35,510 tolars on volume of 1,011 shares for total turnover of 36.2 million tolars.</p>
<p>Petrol eased 0.84 percent to 24,800 tolars on volume of 2,249 shares.</p>
