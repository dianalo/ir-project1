<p>House Commerce Committee chairman Thomas Bliley urged the Clinton administration to help come up with a plan to revise the Superfund toxic waste clean-up program.</p>
<p>Dismissing comments made by senior enforcement officials earlier this week that comprehensive legislative reform of the program was no longer necessary, Bliley said the sweeping changes that Republicans failed to pass this year would need bipartisan support.</p>
<p>"Toward that end, I would like to know whether the Administration is willing to seriously pursue negotiations in the 105th Congress," Bliley said in a December 19 letter to Environmental Protection Agency administrator Carol Browner.</p>
<p>"Signals from the Administration have been mixed on this issue," Bliley said, referring to the administration stepping back from repeated calls for broad legislation to reform the multibillion dollar clean-up program.</p>
<p>EPA officials believe that administrative changes they have made in the program over the last three years have cut legal delays and speeded up the clean-up process.</p>
