<p>Banyan Corp said directors approved a one-for-20 reverse stock split of its Class A common stock, effective immediately.</p>
<p>This reverse split will reduce the number of outstanding common shares to 998,301 shares, inclusive of the shares being issued under Banyan's recapitalization plan, it said.</p>
<p>The recapitalization plan encompasses a nonpublic offering of Class A common.  Banyan said it expects the offering, for an aggregate of $800,000, will be completed by December 31.</p>
<p>It said the proceeds will be used for repayment of short-term debt and working capital which the company proposes to use for business expansion.</p>
<p>In conjunction with the reverse split and recapitalization plan, Banyan said it will make a rights offering to shareholders of record as of December 9.  These shareholders may purchase one right for each share held for $0.01 through January 10.  Each right entitles its holder to purchase two shares of common stock at a price of $0.125 a share.</p>
<p>The rights will become exercisable in a series of cumulating portions throughout 1997.</p>
<p>Banyan also said, effective immediately, its common will trade on the OTC Bulletin Board under the new trading symbol "BANY". -- New York Newsdesk 212-859-1610</p>
