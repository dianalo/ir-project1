<p>The United Auto Workers and General Motors Corp on Saturday reached a tentative contract settlement covering 215,000 U.S. hourly workers, union officials said.</p>
<p>The agreement followed several days of intense bargaining as pressure from local strikes in Indiana and Wisconsin caused production losses for the world's largest automaker.</p>
<p>UAW President Stephen Yokich said that despite the national agreement, the two local strikes at GM's Indianapolis metal stamping plant and its Janesville, Wis., truck assembly plant will continue because local issues remain unresolved.</p>
<p>"Quite frankly the two that have walked out have a heavy agenda on the table and I think they've got a lot of work," he said. Details of the national contract were not immediately available.</p>
<p>In the final hours of negotiations, bargainers at GM's world headquarters had haggled over a list of plants that GM wanted to exclude from employment guarantees in the three-year national contract.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. had already agreed to guarantee jobs for 95 percent of their current hourly work forces, but GM wanted to exclude several parts plants from the guarantees.</p>
