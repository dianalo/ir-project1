<p>New airline Cargo Link Caribbean which is using Bridgetown, Barbados as a mini-hub for airfreight destined for Latin America has had a good first week, its commercial dfirector Peter Brooks told Reuters.</p>
<p>So far it has combined spare belly capacity in tourist carrying BA and Monarch Airlines planes flying to and from the UK with its wet leased DC-8-54F which has a 43 tonnes capacity..</p>
<p>Cargo Link has completed three operations starting with a northbound flight from Santiago and then trips to Lima and again to Santiago. On Saturday it makes a second trip to Lima, Brooks said.</p>
<p>The northbound flights have been full but there have been spaces southbound, Brooks said. Transhipment times at Bridgetown had met targets at about two hours.</p>
<p>Fresh produce had featured in northbound cargoes and Brooks said this may have been fuelled by the disruption to normal trucking traffic in Europe caused by the French trucking dispute. Southbound traffic dodging the Miami bottleneck has mainly been general cargo.</p>
