<p>Following are the highlights of India's agriculture proposals announced by Finance Minister P. Chidambaram in the annual budget for 1997/98 (April-March) on Friday.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>In the agriculture sector the budget for 1997-98 earmarks a number of aresas for special attention. Food and fertiliser subsidies will be increased.</p>
<p>The Central Plan outlay for the agriculture sector has been increased by 13 percent from Rs.2620 crore in the revised estimates for 1996-97 to Rs.2969 crore for 1997-98.</p>
<p>The plan outlay for rural development has been enhanced from Rs.6664 crore according to the revised estimates for 1996-97 to Rs.7691 crore for 1997-98. This is an increase of 15.41%.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>FERTILISER AND FOOD SUBSIDIES ENHANCED</p>
<p>* Subsidy on indigenous fertilisers is being enhanced to Rs.5240 crore in 1997-98 from Rs.4743 crore in the revised estimates of 1996-97.</p>
<p>In addition, subsidy on imported fertilisers is being increased to Rs.1950 crore in 1997-98 as against Rs.1350 crore in the revised estimates of 1996-97. The subsidy on sale of decontrolled fertilisers is being enhanced to Rs.2000 crore in 1997-98 from Rs.1674 crore in the revised estimates of 1996-97.</p>
<p>Shri Chidambaram further announced that an amount of Rs.7500 crore is being earmarked for foodgrains and sugar subsidies in 1997-98 representing an increase of Rs.1434 crore over the revised estimates of 1996-97.</p>
<p>When the dual card system under the Targeted PDS takes effect throughout the country, if more funds are required, I shall provide the same, the Finance Minister added.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>ENHANCEMENT OF RURAL CREDIT</p>
<p>* Enhancement of rural credit is a critical input to the development of agriculture. The Finance Minister in his budget speech said that the CMP calls for doubling of the flow of credit to agriculture and agro-industries within five years. In 1996-97 it is estimated that credit flow to agriculture will increase by 30% from about Rs,22000 crore to nearly 28600 crore. Applauding the success of the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) the Finance Minister said that under RIDF-I Rs.2000 crore was sanctioned for 4530 projects.</p>
<p>By March 1997 disbursements will amount to about Rs.1400 crore. Under RIDF-II, 8387 projects worth over Rs.2500 crore have been sanctioned. RIDF-III will be launched in 1997-98 and Rs.2500 crore will be provided for the same. He urged the States to continue to make the best use of these funds. The Finance Minister announced that the policy of recapitalising the Regional Rural Banks (RRBs) will continue next year. Rs.270 crore have been earmarked for the same. Greater role to sponsor banks in the ownership and management of RRBs is also proposed as indicated by Shri Chidambaram.</p>
<p>NABARD is being strengthened. Rs.500 crore have been given as advance additional share capital to NABARD in the current year. This includes Rs.100 crore by the Government and Rs.400 crore by RBI.</p>
<p>The share capital will be augmented by a similar allocation in 1997-98.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>SOME CONTROLS ON AGRICULTURE ABOLISHED</p>
<p>Some regulations on controls on agriculture products have been abolished. The Rice Milling Industries (Regulation) Act, 1958 and the Ginning and Pressing Factories Act, 1925 will be repealed.</p>
<p>Licensing, price control and requisitioning under the Cold Storage Order, 1964 will be removed. The Edible oils and Edible Oil Seeds Storage Control Order, 1977 and the Cotton Control Order, 1986 will be invoked only in well-defined emergency situations. State governments should follow this lead and abolish as many controls as possible, the Finance Minister urged.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROGRAMMES</p>
<p>The provision for the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme is being enhanced from Rs.900 crore to Rs.1300 crore in 1997-98. The Ganga Kalyan Yojana is intended to support farmers to take up schemes for groundwater and surface water utilisation through a mixture of subsidy, maintenance support and credit arrangements. Rs.200 crore is being provided in 1997-98.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>HOUSING IN THE RURAL AREAS</p>
<p>To give a boost to rural housing, a plan has been worked out in consultation with the National Housing Bank (NHB). Loans, upto Rs.2 lakhs will be given for building houses on freehold land in rural areas at normal rates of interest, subject to the borrower putting in one-third of the value of the house. NHB has been requested to prepare a scheme in which other organisations will also participate. The Prime Minister will launch the scheme on August 15, 1997 and the target is to sanction 50,000 loans in the first year.</p>
