<text>
<p>AMARILLO, Texas, Nov 20, Reuter - Federal Reserve Governor Edward Kelley said Wednesday he sees no sign of a surge in inflation and expects the economy to roll along at a similar pace as that shown in recent quarters.</p>
<p>Kelley told Reuters that inflation levels have remained stable and, despite a recent rise in wages, he was optimistic they will remain that way.</p>
<p>"I certainly see nothing that would lead me to believe that we have a surge in prospect," Kelley said in an interview following a speech to business leaders here.  </p>
<p>Kelley said he believes productivity growth is rising at higher levels than economists can measure and that there are "good prospects that unit costs of production, which measure productivity and unit labor costs, will continue to decline."</p>
<p>In an earlier speech Kelley said he sees economic growth remaining stable.</p>
<p>"Right now, you just don't see any type of economic imbalances that can kick an expansion off track," Kelley said. "In the absence of imbalances, the most likely probability is that we can go along as we have done in recent periods."  </p>
<p>Kelley said that, in spite of the good news, the Federal Reserve needs to be diligent because wages are rising and the economy is running at high capacity levels.</p>
<p>"We have a very fully utilized economy and when you have that, you have to be very careful not to let an inflationary surge begin," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said the major question mark on the economy was the likely future behavior of consumers, adding that there are two schools of thought -- either that consumer confidence is high, unemployment is low and a booming stock market will fuel strong spending, or that excessive levels of personal debt will push consumers into closing their wallets.</p>
<p>"I can see a lot of strength in both arguments," Kelley said.</p>
<p>He said consumer confidence remains high and capital spending levels have surged again recently. But he added it would not be surprising if capital spending were to "slow some."</p>
<p>Finally, he refused to predict consumer spending levels  in the crucial Christmas holiday season. "It is going to be very important to see how that goes," he said.</p>
