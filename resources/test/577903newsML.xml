<p>Political commentators on Monday declared a draw for Italy's two main blocs in mayoral elections in which each side scored significant victories, and said the real winner was the hard-left Communist Refoundation party.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi's centre-left coalition and the centre-right Freedom Alliance both won four of the 10 biggest cities up for grabs in a decisive second-round vote on Sunday, while the separatist Northern League took the other two.</p>
<p>Corriere della Sera newspaper of Milan, Italy's finance capital and a key prize won by the Freedom Alliance, said the draw had ultimately been predictable.</p>
<p>But it added: "There's one sure victor...and like it or not, he's called Fausto Bertinotti."</p>
<p>An electoral pact with Bertinotti's Communist Refoundation paid off for Turin's outgoing mayor, Valentino Castellani, who had trailed the centre-right badly in the first round.</p>
<p>He won by a handful of votes. But Milan's centre-left candidate, Aldo Fumagalli, refused an electoral pact with the hard-left party and lost to businessman Gabriele Albertini.</p>
<p>"The moral is the same -- without Refoundation, it's uphill for the centre-left," Il Messaggero said in an editorial.</p>
<p>The Freedom Alliance said the election proved that Prodi's Olive Tree coalition was "drying up", but the centre-left was swift to point out that it won three cities, including Trieste in the north, with no backing from the hard-left.</p>
<p>Prodi relies on Bertinotti's Communist Refoundation party for a parliamentary majority but key ideological differences have strained their often testy relationship to its limits.</p>
<p>A mutiny last month by Refoundation over an Italian-led security force for Albania almost felled Prodi's year-old government and bigger battles lie ahead over welfare reform. Bertinotti is insisting social spending cannot be cut.</p>
<p>La Stampa concluded that Bertinotti had come off best and that "the opinion of the polls was certainly not reassuring for the prospect of a centre-left without Refoundation".</p>
<p>It said Bertinotti's hand was strengthened since Prodi would now have to take note of Bertinotti more than ever, and reckoned Refoundation would seek to make capital out of that influence in a special cross-party parliamentary commission on institutional reforms that is re-examining Italy's outdated constitution.</p>
<p>Commentators said former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi's Freedom Alliance could be pleased with its showing but Rome's leftist mayor, who faces his own re-election contest later this year, said Berlusconi did not give Prodi the drubbing he had hoped for.</p>
<p>"If the Freedom Alliance, wrongly, was hoping for a message against the government, well I don't think it got one," Francesco Rutelli told La Repubblica newspaper.</p>
<p>But Corriere della Sera said the fact that the centre-right had a tougher time in the second round run-offs than against the wider first-round field indicated it was still having trouble winning over supporters of the separatist Northern League.</p>
<p>The League, criticised for fomenting the kind of separatist sentiment that led to last week's bizarre occupation by an armed band of the belltower in St Mark's Square in Venice, lost Milan but won in the northern cities of Lecco and Pordenone.</p>
<p>Il Messaggero said those wins proved the League could still attract a protest vote and praised Massimo D'Alema, head of the reform commission and of the Democratic Party of the Left, for urging League leader Umberto Bossi to return to negotiations.</p>
<p>"The chase for Umberto, the prodigal son, is on again," it said.</p>
