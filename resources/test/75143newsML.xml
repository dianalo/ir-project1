<p>Leading Nicaraguan presidential candidate Arnoldo Aleman protested media censorship on Wednesday after election officials banned a controversial TV advertisement attacking his Sandinista opponents.</p>
<p>At the leftist Sandinistas' request, Nicaragua's Supreme Election Council (CSE) banned an ad that used footage taken during the 1979-1990 Sandinista government to warn voters against supporting that party in Oct. 20 general elections.</p>
<p>"The CSE can't put a muzzle on the history of the past decade," Aleman, a conservative former mayor of the capital Managua, said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Aleman alleged censorship and said it set a dangerous precedent in the democratic 1990s when Nicaraguans have enjoyed extensive freedom of expression after decades of authoritarian rule.</p>
<p>"Take note. Just when we starting feeling our freedom of expression, this comes along," he said.</p>
<p>The TV spot showed images of empty store shelves, businesses closed by the state and rows of dead bodies from the Sandinista's eight-year war against U.S.-backed Contra rebels in the 1980s.</p>
<p>An advertisement showing the Sandinistas' then-President Daniel Ortega in 1986 announcing the closure of the opposition newspaper La Prensa and the placing of restrictions on the media is still running on Nicaraguan television.</p>
<p>The president of the CSE, Rosa Marina Zelaya, and representatives of the Sandinista Front said the banned ad took historical events out of context and went against the principles of "peace, harmony, respect and tolerance" demanded by Nicaragua's code of election ethics.</p>
<p>Aleman currently leads Ortega, who is seeking to return to the presidency, by six percentage points in opinion polls.</p>
