<p>Guerrillas holding 72 hostages for a 41st day fired at police for the first time on Monday as security forces circled the besieged Japanese ambassador's residence in a display of strength designed to weaken rebel resolve.</p>
<p>Several bullets struck an armed vehicle carrying police who were training their semi-automatic weapons on the residence and participating in the largest show of official force since the crisis began on Dec. 17, police and witnesses said.</p>
<p>"One bullet ricocheted off the front window and the others hit the back (of the vehicle)," one policeman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The gunfire, which missed police by several inches (cm), appeared to be the first incidence of shooting that endangered anyone. On previous occasions, rebels fired warning shots into the air hours after police manoeuvres.</p>
<p>About 200 special forces operatives and four armed vehicles paraded at least five times around the ambassador's home while military march music blared from speakers erected outside the compound for the first time on Monday.</p>
<p>The shots came after Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) rebels shouted at the police aboard the armoured cars and the officers responded with obscene gestures.</p>
<p>Two police officers said in interviews at the site they had received orders not to shoot at the rebels.</p>
<p>In an apparent bid to unnerve some 15 rebels in the residence, police have previously pitched stones and garbage into the compound, flown overhead and moved in armoured vehicles and special forces with high-powered rifles.</p>
<p>Japan on Monday asked Peru to limit police manoeuvres around the diplomatic residence in Lima, fearing they could unsettle the hostages held by the MRTA.</p>
<p>"I'm worrying how it may affect the hostages inside. I'm wondering if I can ask ... the Peruvian government not to go too far," Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said in Tokyo. "Not thinking of the hostages' mental state may have an adverse effect."</p>
<p>The rebels, who mined and booby-trapped the residence, sang their defiant hymn early on Monday and a guerrilla yelled: "What is the objective of this mission? To vanquish or to die!"</p>
<p>The MRTA's international spokesman said the police activity indicated the site would be stormed. He warned that an attack would unleash a backlash from the rebel movement.</p>
<p>"If the residence is stormed, the situation will intensify and become much worse. All across Peru, armed commandos of the MRTA are ready to carry out attacks on economic and political targets," MRTA spokesman Isaac Velazco said in an inteview with Germany's Junge Welt daily published on Monday.</p>
<p>"The deaths of Tupac Amaru fighters would escalate the conflict across the country," he added in the interview, which was carried on the MRTA's Internet web page.</p>
<p>Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi told a news conference that Tokyo had conveyed its concern to Lima, urging the government to pursue "earnest efforts toward a prompt conclusion of the hostage crisis."</p>
<p>President Alberto Fujimori, whose brother, Pedro, is among the captives, insisted police manoeuvres were not a prelude to an assault and that he was seeking a negotiated resolution.</p>
<p>Talks remain deadlocked over the MRTA demand that 400 jailed comrades be freed and Fujimori's refusal to discuss it.</p>
<p>But in an apparent goodwill gesture on Monday, the government negotiator, Education Minister Domingo Palermo, said that Catholic clergymen would form part of a commission to ensure jailed MRTA rebels are fairly treated.</p>
<p>The rebels, who take the name for their movement from an 18th century Indian leader who led an uprising against Spanish colonial rule, orginally seized hundreds of guests when they stormed a garden party at the residence.</p>
<p>They released most in what they called "goodwill gestures," keeping those they consider the most important bargaining chips, including two Peruvian ministers, generals, security chiefs, about two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats and the Japanese and Bolivian ambassadors.</p>
