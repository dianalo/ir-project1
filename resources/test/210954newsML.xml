<p>British multi-utility Hyder Plc should see operating cost savings at its regulated water business continue at current rates of around 2.5 percent in real terms, managing director Graham Hawker told Reuters. "We should carry on at something like that rate," achieved in the first half of a decrease of 2.5 percent in real terms, he said in a telephone interview. Hawker added that South Wales Electricity (Swalec), the regional electricity company (Rec) which was taken over by Welsh Water early this year to form Hyder, was seeing cost savings ahead of plans.  </p>
<p>"Before the bid, Swalec was looking at savings of 45 million pounds by 2000. We are slighly ahead on achieving those," Hawker said. Hyder said in a statement with half year results that Swalec should be materially earnings enhancing in the year. Hawker said the company intended to "carry on taking the cost out" from its regulated business, which would help to contribute to dividend growth. Hyder increased its dividend 11 percent in real terms to 14.6 pence but Hawker would not commit to future levels of increase.  </p>
<p>"We will let actions speak louder than words," he said.</p>
<p>He added that cost cuts from the regulated businesses would eventually slow and so the company aimed to grow its unregulated business, which turned in profits before interest of 13.1 million stg in the half year. He said Hyder's non-regulated infrastructure business should benefit from moves by government to finance projects through its Private Finance Initiative (PFI).</p>
<p>"That could be a very big market," Hawker said.</p>
<p>Hyder will aim to secure a "largish number of five to 10 million stg a time projects," which spread exposure, Hawker said.</p>
<p>He said returns for Hyder on its involvement with a group which won a contract to improve, run and maintain 122 kilometres of the M40 motorway between London and Warwick in central England "will considerably exceed our cost of capital." Hyder's financial involvement in the project is some five million stg, Hawker said.</p>
