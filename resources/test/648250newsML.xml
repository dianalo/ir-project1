<p>Shares in UK enginering group Bridon Plc jumped on Monday after a report in the Sunday Times newspaper highlighted recent purchases of the stock by the group's directors, dealers said.</p>
<p>Bridon shares climbed eight pence to 98-1/2p by 0902 GMT in volume of 128,000 shares.  </p>
<p>The newspaper said Bill Hobbs, a Bridon director, bought 100,000 shares at 99p at the end of May and James Newman, the finance director, purchased 5,000 shares at the same time.</p>
<p>This followed purchases of 10,000 shares by Newman five months earlier and of 5,000 shares by chairman Brian Clayton at the end of last year.</p>
<p>The report also said Bridon's order book for manufactured products had improved and the group had won a contract to supply wire for the Jianyin Bridge in China.</p>
<p>Bridon later told Reuters its order book for its wire and rope products was strong compared with last year and its distribution business was "trading well". The group also confirmed the contract to supply wire for the Jianyin Bridge.</p>
<p>Bridon made pre-tax profits for the end December 31, 1996 of 7.3 million stg following a loss of 639,000 stg the previous year.</p>
<p>The consensus of analysts forecasts of pre-tax profits for the 1997 year end are around the 10 million stg mark.</p>
