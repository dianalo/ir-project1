<p>Turkish Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan, under attack at home and abroad for his visits to Nigeria and Libya, on Tuesday signed economic agreements with Nigeria's military government.</p>
<p>A joint statement after the signing said the two countries hoped to boost trade to an annual $500 million on each side from just over $1 million at the moment.</p>
<p>"This is a historic day and a happy one indeed because the agreements signed today have gone a long way to improve our relationship," Erbakan said after the signing.</p>
<p>"Our businessmen are now free to do business together, so also are our governments."</p>
<p>Nigeria is the Islamist premier's last stop on a tour that has outraged a large section of both the Turkish public and the NATO country's traditional western allies.</p>
<p>Erbakan flew into Nigeria on Monday after visiting Egypt and Libya.</p>
<p>Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, is an international outcast because of its human rights record and the failure of its military government to ensure a swift return to civilian rule.</p>
<p>Western countries hold Libya responsible for the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 over Scotland in 1988, which killed 270 people. The United Nations has imposed sanctions on Libya, demanding that it hand over two suspects in the bombing.</p>
<p>United States Secretary of State Warren Christopher on Monday sought support from the Commonwealth and European Union for sanctions on Nigeria, as he began a continental tour that will not bring him to Abuja.</p>
<p>Limited sanctions were imposed by western countries in November when Nigeria hanged nine minority rights activists, including author Ken Saro-Wiwa, for murder.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth of Britain and its former colonies last month pulled back from imposing proposed sanctions to give Nigeria a chance for dialogue.</p>
<p>Christopher did not elaborate on possible measures, but U.S. officials said there was no chance of an embargo on crude oil sales that account for 95 percent of Nigeria's export earnings.</p>
<p>Erbakan and Nigeria's Chief of General Staff Lieutenant- General Oladipo Diya signed a trade agreement, a joint economic protocol, a maritime agreement and an agreement promoting and protecting investment between the two countries.</p>
<p>A statement after the meeting said Abacha had also accepted an invitation to visit Turkey at an unspecified date.</p>
<p>"Abacha has approved the immediate setting up of a full-fledged Nigerian embassy in Turkey as well as the sending of a football team," Diya said.</p>
<p>Trade between the two countries is set to receive a boost in 1999, when Turkey has said it will take $100 million of liquified natural gas from a plant currently under construction.</p>
<p>Erbakan brought with him four government ministers and about 200 businessmen including chief executives of some of Turkey's largest companies.</p>
<p>Apart from oil and gas cooperation between Turkey and Nigeria, the visit went into details that have not yet been made public on commerce and tourism, construction, agriculture, banking, health, free trade zones, transportation and telecommunications.</p>
<p>Turkey's opposition and its media have attacked Erbakan for his weekend visit to Libya during which Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi strongly criticised Turkey's treatment of its Kurds and its western ties.</p>
<p>Turkey said has said it would temporarily recall its ambassador to Tripoli over the affair and a Turkish left-wing party said it had requested a parliamentary censure motion to topple Erbakan.</p>
