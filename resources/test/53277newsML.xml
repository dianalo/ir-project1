<p>A federal judge refused on Friday to release a former business partner of President Bill Clinton who went to jail rather than testify before a grand jury investigating the Whitewater affair.</p>
<p>The judge said Susan McDougal would remain in jail until she agreed to cooperate with the grand jury, or the grand jury's term expired in about a year.</p>
<p>Asked by reporters outside the courtroom what would change her mind about testifying, McDougal answered: "Only the rack or the pillory." During the hearing McDougal asserted that the Whitewater prosecutors had ruined her life.</p>
<p>McDougal surrendered to federal marshals last Monday to begin serving a contempt of court sentence imposed by federal judge Susan Webber Wright.</p>
<p>McDougal, her ex-husband James and then-Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker were convicted on a string of fraud and conspiracy charges in the first Whitewater trial in May. The McDougals were close friends of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton and the four joined in the ill-fated Whitewater real estate venture that has dogged Clinton throughout most of his presidency.</p>
<p>Susan McDougal was sentenced to two years in prison for four convictions stemming from an illegal $300,000 loan she was given in 1986 by Arkansas banker David Hale, who testified -- after making a plea bargain deal -- that Clinton, then the governor of Arkansas, twice pressured him to approve the loan.</p>
<p>Clinton denied the accusations in videotaped testimony on behalf of the McDougals, but prosecutors apparently did not believe him and wanted to question Susan McDougal on Clinton's role in winning the loan and on whether he had lied in court.</p>
<p>McDougal said she was afraid the Whitewater prosecutors would charge her with perjury if her answers failed to incriminate the Clintons.</p>
<p>In court on Friday, McDougal pointed to the prosecutors and said, "They've already killed me. They've ruined my life. And now they're after the Clintons."</p>
<p>When Judge Wright reminded McDougal that she was disparaging "officers of the court," McDougal replied, "That's a shame unto the Lord."</p>
<p>Added McDougal, "I have no contempt for the court. But nothing could purse me of contempt for the independent counsel."</p>
<p>McDougal was in court to argue her motion to overturn Wright's contempt citation.</p>
