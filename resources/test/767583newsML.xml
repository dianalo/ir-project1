<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright swept aside Malaysian leader Mahathir Mohamad's criticisms of the West on Tuesday and said she did not think he spoke for his region.</p>
<p>"I think that Dr Mahathir is a case of his own," she told reporters after major regional meetings in Kuala Lumpur which Mahathir opened with an attack on "unscrupulous" Western currency speculators.</p>
<p>The Malaysian Prime Minister also renewed his criticisms of the United States during the meeting, to some applause from around South and Southeast Asia, where he is often regarded as a spokesman for the region.</p>
<p>"He has his views that he stated rather harshly, I felt," Albright said.</p>
<p>"They are not reflected, as far as I can see, in the general tenor of the younger generation of leadership of the ASEAN countries," Albright said of the nine-nation Association of South East Asian Nations.</p>
<p>"I do think that Dr Mahathir has the perspective that is reflective of his generation but is not reflected amongst the other leaders whom I met," she said.</p>
<p>But, she said, not all members of Mahathir's generation of leaders in their seventies shared his perspective, picking out her talks on Tuesday with former Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew as a highlight of her Asian tour.</p>
<p>"Lee Kuan Yew is obviously one of the older people in the region and has the most modern and strategic vision of anyone I've met in a long time," Albright said.</p>
<p>Mahathir's blunt criticisms were sparked by a heavy fall in the value of several Southeast Asian currencies since they came under speculative attack in mid-May.</p>
<p>The tough-talking Mahathir called currency speculators "rogues", "robbers", "anarchists" and "brigands" with a "political agenda" to "destroy all the progress that we have made".</p>
<p>He accused American financier George Soros of deliberately attacking ASEAN currencies for allowing military-ruled Burma into the organisation.</p>
<p>Soros has denied attempts to destabilise Asian currencies, saying his financial ventures had nothing to do with his opposition to Burma's membership of ASEAN.</p>
<p>The organisation also includes Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>The United States lobbied hard against Burma's entry, formally completed last week just before ASEAN had its annual talks with other major countries, including the United States, Russia, China, Japan and India.</p>
<p>But Albright said on Tuesday that now Burma was a member of ASEAN, Washington expected to see the organisation bring about swifter change in the country, from which democracy campaigner Aung San Suu Kyi has captured huge attention.</p>
<p>She said she expressed U.S. views "fairly strongly" that ASEAN had to do something "to move the process forward" in pushing Rangoon towards a more liberal regime.</p>
<p>And Albright said she felt she had struck a resonant chord among ASEAN foreign ministers at the meeting.</p>
<p>"I think, frankly, that I articulated what some of them had been thinking and were more willing to admit than I had expected that the process in Burma had been slower than they would have liked," she said.</p>
