<p>The US$500 million unsecured financing for a Chinese Estates' guaranteed US$500 million financing will pay commitment fees ranging from 40 to 72.5 basis points, bankers said Thursday.</p>
<p>The financing, which will be carried out under the name Good Top, combines an FRN tranche and a term loan/revolving credit tranche. Lenders may participate in the FRN and/or the loan tranches, although those participating in the loan tranche must commit 35 percent to the term loan and 65 percent to the revolving credit.</p>
<p>The facility can be put by the lenders at the end of three years and can be called by Chinese Estates annually.</p>
<p>The interest margin for both the FRN and the loan tranches is set at 165 basis points for years one through three and 190 basis points for years four and five.</p>
<p>Bankers said fees are 72.5 basis points for co-arrangers committing US$25 million, 67.5 basis points for co-arrangers committing US$20 million, 55 basis points for lead managers committing US$11-15 million, 47.5 basis points for senior managers committing US$6-10 million and 40 basis points for managers committing US$3-5 million.</p>
<p>The eight core arrangers of the transaction are Chase Manhattan Asia, China Development Finance Co HK, Citicorp International, Deutsche Bank Hong Kong branch, Hua Chiao Commercial Bank, Peregrine Fixed Income, American Express Bank and BA Asia.</p>
<p>General syndication will begin shortly, Citicorp said Wednesday.</p>
