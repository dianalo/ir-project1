<p>China has promised to scrap its remaining non-tariff barriers to foreign imports within eight years as part of its attempt to gain entry to the World Trade Organisation, the China Economic Times said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The vow to scrap all non-tariff measures that did not accord with WTO standards was made in Geneva on August 1 and was expected to have a positive effect on Beijing's chances of acceding to the global trade club, the official newspaper said.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of non-tariff measures would be eliminated within six years, while those affecting the remaining products, which would include automobiles, would be removed within eight years, it said.</p>
<p>Non-tariff measures currently affect 343 classes of imported goods, down from 1,247 in 1992, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>It quoted the chairman of China's WTO work group Ji Lade as saying the hard work put into Beijing's entry offer was reflected in amendments to its proposals on non-tariff measures and agricultural subsidies, but gave no further details.</p>
