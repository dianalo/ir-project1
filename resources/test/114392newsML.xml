<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle prices fell $1.00 per cwt to $70.00, compared with last week, in light trading after midday, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Between 4,000 and 6,000 head sold in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area, but volume could be larger as the day progresses, sources said. In Kansas, 2,500 to 3,000 head traded in slow activity, they said.</p>
<p>Major packers started the day bidding $70.00 against asking levels of $72.00 to $73.00. At least one key packer dropped bids to $69.00 once $70.00 sales were reported, sources noted.  </p>
<p>Cattle owners were earning roughly $85.00 per head at $70.00, but each, but each $1.00 decline in fed cattle prices could shave an estimated $12.00 from their profits, according to one Kansas feedlot operator.</p>
<p>Prices had been expected to be underpinned by tight supplies of finished cattle on showlists this week and by ideas strong weekend demand would lift beef prices.</p>
<p>But, Fed cattle prices slipped when midday beef prices were quoted weaker, and CME live cattle futures plummeted, sources said.</p>
