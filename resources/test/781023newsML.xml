<headline>NFL AMERICAN FOOTBALL-COWBOYS FINE SWITZER $75,000 FOR GUN INCIDENT.</headline>

<p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones fined his head coach Barry Switzer a whopping $75,000 on Wednesday after Switzer was arrested for carrying a loaded gun through a busy international airport.</p>
<p>Jones, whose efforts to clean up the Cowboys' tarnished image suffered a heavy blow with Switzer's arrest on Monday, said he hoped the fine would send a clear message that the team is changing its ways for good.</p>
<p>"I'm fining Barry Switzer $75,000. Period," Jones told reporters at the Cowboys pre-season training camp in Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>"I hope the actions I am taking will be a reinforcement to our fans and everyone involved that we are working towards a long-term, not a short-term, effort to educate ourselves and help create more awareness of our responsibility," Jones said.</p>
<p>Switzer was arrested at Dallas-fort Worth International Airport on Monday morning when a .38 calibre handgun was found in his carry-on luggage as he walked through a security checkpoint before boarding a plane to Austin.</p>
<p>Switzer apologised for the incident but said he had no idea the gun was in the bag.</p>
<p>He said he hid it in there last Saturday because there were three children visiting his house, and that he forgot to take it out later.</p>
<p>"It's unfortunate, it's embarrassing to me, but I can live with it because I was more concerned about the safety of those children," Switzer said on Monday.</p>
<p>Several Cowboys players rallied behind Switzer but Jones, who has staunchly defended his head coach from criticism in the past, was less understanding.</p>
<p>He said he accepted Switzer's explanation but stressed that the offence was too serious to go unpunished.</p>
<p>"We are accountable and just being sorry and just apologising for an action that was not intentional is not enough," Jones said.</p>
<p>He said the $75,000 would go to a charity organisation that helps the families of Texas police and firefighters who have been killed or seriously injured in the line of duty.</p>
<p>The Cowboys team has won three super Bowl titles in the 1990s but its public image has been battered by a series of sex and drugs scandals involving some of its star players.</p>
<p>Jones recently decided to try to put a stop to the off-the-field problems and has imposed a new code of conduct aimed at keeping his players away from strip clubs and night spots where they are likely to get into trouble.</p>
<p>Switzer, who is in his fourth season as Cowboys head coach, could face charges for the gun incident.</p>
<p>It is a third-degree felony punishable by two to 10 years in jail and a fine of up to $10,000 but, while police are expected to file charges, it is not yet clear whether U.S. or state prosecutors will actually take up the case if they believe it was a genuine accident.</p>
<p>The Texas Department of Public Safety said Switzer was not licensed to carry a gun. Carrying a handgun without a permit is a lesser charge under state law, a crime in theory punishable by as much as a year in jail and a $4,000 fine.</p>
<p>The Cowboys opened their preseason last Sunday with a 34-27 loss to the Oakland Raiders at Texas Stadium.</p>
