<p>Britain's annual budget next month will cut taxes only if it is prudent to do so, Prime Minister John Major said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He told the annual conference of his Conservative Party: "If it is appropriate and prudent to cut taxes, our first instinct would be to cut taxes. But if it is not, if it would be imprudent, and would imperil the recovery that we have got...then we would not do so."</p>
<p>"We will make a judgment on what is right for the country. We will not make an imprudent budget judgment," he added.  </p>
<p>Major, speaking during a question and answer session, said no one would expect him to reveal budget secrets in a public forum. But he added: "That we are tax cutters, all of us, every single member of the Cabinet and the party, is beyond doubt. It is one of our instincts."</p>
