<p>The Egyptian government will offer shares in the Midor refinery near Alexandria to public subscription if Spanish company Repsol and Italy's Agip decline offers to buy stakes in the project.</p>
<p>Oil Minister Hamdi el-Banbi said the state's Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC) took a majority stake in the $1.2 billion project earlier this year only to ensure that work on the refinery goes ahead on schedule.</p>
<p>He said the private sector role in the project was part of a trend towards bringing private capital into many aspects of the Egyptian petroleum industry, where the state has traditionally dominated downstream activities.</p>
<p>"EGPC does not want and does not like to be in the refinery but it had to... The Israeli side had some financing problems so instead of making this refinery idea die out, EGPC stepped in to take 60 percent," Banbi told a news conference.</p>
<p>The other partners in the refinery under the new structure are the Israeli Merhaf Group and Maska Swiss, an Egyptian-owned Swiss company. The companies have 20 percent each.</p>
<p>Banbi said EGPC had offered to sell Repsol and Agip a 20 percent stake each in the company from its share, but they had not yet reached a decision.</p>
<p>"If they come, fine. If they do not come, we will go to the public share (public subscription). We are insisting to have this refinery majority-owned by private companies," he said.</p>
<p>The minister gave new details of a decision to hive off many of EGPC's gas activities into the new and nominally private company Gasco (Egyptian Company for Natural Gases).</p>
<p>He said Gasco was taking over some of the assets of Petrogas and Egypt Gas, which are majority state-owned.</p>
<p>Gasco would have to remain Egyptian for the time being because it would take time for the Egyptian state to assess the value of the assets the company will be taking.</p>
<p>"If we accept any foreign participation the assets must be properly evaluated and certain money transactions will be done and if we do that it will take one or two years," he said.</p>
<p>But GASCO could eventually be open to investment and the state would sell shares in it to the public, he said.</p>
<p>The minister cited five other examples of the state giving the private sector a role in downstream activities:</p>
<p>-- Sidi Kreir Petrochemical Company, which will convert ethane and propane into ethylene at a plant with a capacity of 300,000 tonnes a year, and then produce 200,000 tonnes of polyethylene a year. He did not mention the owners.</p>
<p>-- Egypt is negotiating with Phillips Petroleum on a joint venture to produce 150,000 tonnes a year of high-density polyethylene. Phillips will probably end up with a 100 percent stake in the project, Banbi said.</p>
<p>-- The French company Total has signed an agreement with the EGPC subsidiary Societe Cooperative des Petroles on 150 filling stations across Egypt. He did not say what the agreement entailed and Total officials were not available for comment.</p>
<p>-- EGPC is setting up a private sector company to crack fuel oil in Suez, Banbi said. Press reports last year said EGPC wanted local banks and insurance companies to invest in a hydrocracker at state-owned Nasr Petroleum's refinery in Suez.</p>
<p>-- Oriental Petrochemicals, which is building a plant to produce 120,000 tonnes of polypropylene a year near Alexandria. The company is dominated by private Egyptian investors but the Oil Ministry will have a small stake.</p>
