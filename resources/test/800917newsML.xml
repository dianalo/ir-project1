<p>Australia's bigest construction group Leighton Holdings Ltd reported on Thursday a better than expected annual net profit, a surprise special dividend and started a review of options for the group's large cash holdings.</p>
<p>Leighton, which is 44.9 percent owned by Hochtief Ag, reported a 32.1 percent rise in pre-abnormal net profit to A$86.24 million for the year to June 30, 1997, slightly above the upper end of expectations.</p>
<p>The Sydney-based group also paid a special 10 cents per share dividend, which sent the stock price soaring.  </p>
<p>Leighton shares closed 34 cents or 5.88 percent up at A$6.12, but was still below its peak of A$6.63 hit on June 25, 1997. For the outlook, the group tipped more growth to come.</p>
<p>"Our own internal analysis shows the company should improve over the next two to three years," Leighton chief executive Wal King told reporters.</p>
<p>"The company has a large momentum of work. We have on hand work that will carry through over the next couple of years," he said, adding he expected the group to closely maintain the current level of work in hand, A$4.23 billion, in 1997/98.  </p>
<p>King also said it had appointed Port Jackson and Associates for a strategic review of the construction company.</p>
<p>The debt-free company, which has operations based in Australia and Southeast Asia, has available cash of A$422.88 million. King said there would be no quick decisions made on any uses for the cash, including acquisitions.</p>
<p>"I don't feel pressured in what we are going to do with the cash," King said. He said the review would be completed by December. "We are giving a good rate of return and we expect to continue that rate of return," he said.  </p>
<p>Leighton produced a return on shareholders funds of 25.2 percent in 1996/97, compared with 14.9 percent a year earlier.</p>
<p>"It was a great result," one Sydney-based construction analyst said.</p>
<p>"But in terms of future growth, I think they will be growing at a slower rate," he said.</p>
<p>King said the Leighton was interested in expanding into the South American contract mining industry, where many Australian miners have set up operations in recent years.</p>
<p>About half of Leighton's work in hand is in contract mining.  </p>
<p>He downplayed suggestions of acquisitions or a capital return to shareholders. "We are not overly keen on acquisitions," said King, adding the company would still look at corporate activity proposals.</p>
<p>"...I think a return of capital is almost giving up, saying that you can't further expand the business," he said.</p>
<p>Profits from Leighton's Australian and Asian operations both increased, along with future contract work loads, it said.</p>
<p>King said most of the group's Asian operations are in Hong Kong and Indonesia, but it also had businesses in Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam and the Philippines.  </p>
<p>"In Hong Kong we are quite optimistic about the medium term. The handover has gone extremely smoothly. The economy is expected to continue to grow and since the handover the company has picked up some more contracts," King said.</p>
<p>"Whilst Thailand has suffered from some economic problems, we believe opportunities will present themselves and we will be looking at selected opportunities and particularly in the Philippines where the mining opportunities look good," he said.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, the company had doubled its workload, he said.</p>
