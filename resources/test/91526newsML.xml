<p>After two days of weakness, ARA fuel oil bunkers headed back up on Wednesday, but bunker prices in other areas were steady, dealers said.</p>
<p>Rotterdam 380 CST traded in the range $118-$1205 fob in the afternoon after barge prices rose. Shipowners withdrew their business and the ARA market barely managed 10,000 tonnes of deals.</p>
<p>"Most (of the shipownwers) have decided to wait, but I doubt if that's clever," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Hamburg prices were little changed. A few enquiries kept suppliers relatively busy, although the volume was not large.</p>
<p>Mediterranean bunkers were steady, but suppliers felt prices would rise on Thursday. Despite this expectation, trading was very weak. Prices were noticeably higher in Italy than elsewhere in southern Europe.</p>
<p>The Fujairah market still looked strong with 380 CST offers moving out by $1 a tonne to $116.</p>
<p>Easing of supply difficulties in Durban led to lower prices. Fuel oil 180 CST was quoted at around $125/$127.</p>
