<headline>Jewell signs movie deal with Fox - report.</headline>

<p>Richard Jewell has signed a movie deal with Rupert Murdoch's 20th Century Fox for rights to the story of his ordeal in the Olympic Park bombing, Daily Variety reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>Variety said the deal, signed with Fox and producer Linda Obst, covers rights to Jewell, his family and attorneys and a Vanity Fair story titled "An American Nightmare."</p>
<p>The entertainment industry trade paper did not give the value of the deal, although previous reports said Jewell had been negotiating with Fox for about $500,000.</p>
<p>Lin Wood, an attorney for Jewell, could not immediately confirm the report. But he acknowledged Fox had won the upper hand over other Hollywood studios that were interested in telling Jewell's story.</p>
<p>"No papers have been signed to my knowledge. But I can say that the discussions clearly now are solely with Fox 2000. And it's my understanding that a decision is very close at hand on that," he said.</p>
<p>Jewell, a 34-year-old former security guard, was named by the Atlanta Constitution as a suspect in the July 27, 1996 bombing that killed two people and injured more than 100 at the summer Olympic Games in Atlanta.</p>
<p>For the next three months Jewell was hounded by television news crews and federal agents, who searched his home but never found any evidence against him. The Justice Department publicly cleared Jewell in October of all suspicion in the case and he has since embarked on a legal battle, suing various news organisations and individual FBI agents.</p>
<p>Jewell has already reached settlements with NBC and Cable News Network, both which were confidential but reported to be worth more than $500,000. He recently brought suit against Atlanta Constitution publisher Cox Enterprises.</p>
<p>CNN officials said on Thursday that Jewell also obtained an agreement that CNN's parent, Time Warner Inc, would discuss a possible book deal. The deal was not part of the settlement but during the negotiations CNN lawyers raised the possibility of exploratory talks with Time Warner, which owns Time-Life Books. Jewell and his mother Barbara assented to the idea.</p>
<p>Jewell's attorneys were quick to point out that the signed agreement in itself did not represent a book deal. CNN said neither side was obligated to anything.</p>
