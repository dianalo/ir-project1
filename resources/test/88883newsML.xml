<p>Relatives of some of the 10 local women killed in a two-year strangling and stabbing spree wept in court on Monday at final legal proceedings before the start of suspect Henry Wallace's trial this week.</p>
<p>The faces of the dead women flashed across a television screen in court as attorneys for Wallace played a videotape of several local television news stories linking him to the women.</p>
<p>The defence attorneys sought to show there had been too much publicity in the case since Wallace's arrest in March 1994 and hoped the judge would change the venue for the trial.</p>
<p>While Wallace sat calmly between lawyers and watched the tape, his chin resting on his clasped hands, some victims' relatives were overcome with emotion.</p>
<p>"It has been a long 2-1/2 years, and it seemed like nothing would be done," said Alphonso Slaughter, whose oldest child, Debra, was allegedly Wallace's last victim. "It's a great relief that we are starting."</p>
<p>George Burrell, a cousin of Wallace's alleged eighth victim, Brandi Henderson, sobbed softly as the tape played. "To watch those tapes and see her -- I'll just be glad when it's over," he said afterward.</p>
<p>That may not be for months. Jury selection, due to get under way this week, was expected to last three weeks and testimony about seven weeks, lawyers have said.</p>
<p>Wallace, a 30-year-old former retaurant worker, was charged with killing 10 Charlotte, North Carolina, women between May 1992 and March 1994 -- mainly through strangulation.</p>
<p>He was about to be tried on nine counts of first-degree murder. Prosecutors Marsha Goodenow and Anne Tompkins sought seeking the death penalty on each count.</p>
<p>Wallace could face a separate trial on a lesser charge in the first killing.</p>
<p>The prosecutors were expected to use an audiotaped confession Wallace gave police in which he described raping and killing the women before robbing them to support his addiction to crack cocaine.</p>
<p>"I can't really say I had control, but I knew I was doing someting wrong. I couldn't stop. If I stopped now, I would be caught," Wallace told police after his arrest.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers continued on Monday to argue that the statements were illegally obtained by police.</p>
<p>"He was tired after being up all night (for interrogation) and strung out on drugs when the confession was obtained, and he expected favours from the police, like the chance to see his daughter," lawyer James Cooney said.</p>
<p>Cooney and Public Defender Isabelle Day maintained Wallace was mentally ill and did not intend to kill. Intention must be proved in a first-degree murder conviction.</p>
<p>Cooney complained of nearly 2,000 local news reports, in some of which police were quoted as calling Wallace "cunning" and "smart."</p>
<p>"That undermines the credibility of a mental illness defence and mitigating issues should we get that far," he told the court.</p>
<p>Wallace dumped a body in the woods, left another submerged in a bathtub full of water, put one in the shower to wash away evidence and set another on fire, according to the confession.</p>
<p>Criminologist Katherine Jamieson testified for the defence that too many potential jurors had seen, read or heard of the confession for Wallace to receive a fair trial. "The depth of the publicity was very strong," she said, citing a survey she conducted last year.</p>
