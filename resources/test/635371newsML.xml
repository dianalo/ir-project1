<p>The World Wide Web has taken off in China's biggest city and its mercantile heart, with individuals now accounting for about half the city's cyberspace surfers, Internet service providers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The number of Internet surfers in Shanghai hit 40,000-50,000 by the end of May, around half of whom were individuals on their own accounts, local Internet providers said. China had a total of 100,000 registered Internet users at the end of 1996, official figures show.</p>
<p>"The Internet business has developed quickly in Shanghai and we have already more than 2,000 customers, though we just began Internet service late last year," said a sales manager with Shanghai Information Industrial Co Ltd.</p>
<p>The company, which is under control of the local post and telecommunication bureau, is one of the biggest Internet providers in the booming coastal city.</p>
<p>China opened its first official Internet link in May 1995 and has moved to regulate domestic access to the network, ordering providers to apply for licences and requiring users to register with the police and promise not to harm the state or commit crimes.</p>
<p>"Now we have around 100 new accounts opening every month, of which individuals account for 50 percent," the official said.</p>
<p>"They (individual account holders) have shown a stronger interest in the Internet compared to local companies," she said.</p>
<p>Younger residents 20-30 years old had accepted the Internet the fastest and accounted for most individual users, an official with another local Internet provider said.</p>
<p>"More young people have a sound knowlege of computers compared to old people and they are usually better at accepting new ideas," said one executive with a major local information network firm.</p>
<p>"With more companies providing Internet services, prices have fallen sharply recently and more young people can afford the service," one industrial analyst said.</p>
<p>Companies providing Internet service mushroomed to 15 to 20 over the past year, pushing prices for hooking up to the global computer network down to eight to nine yuan ($0.96-1.1) an hour from 20 yuan an hour the previous year, local providers said.</p>
<p>But industry analysts say the Internet has taken a long time to catch on in Shanghai because personal computers (PCs) are still not widely used in the city.</p>
<p>"Personal computers are just beginning to play a roll in local residents' daily life, one analyst said. "Less than 10 percent of people in the city own PCs, which has blocked the further spread of the Internet."</p>
<p>Shanghai-based newspaper the Liberation Daily on Monday quoted Vice-Mayor Chen Zhili as saying that six percent of families in the city now owned PCs.</p>
<p>But analysts say the potential computer and Internet market in the city of 17 million people is huge, with nationwide demand for PCs is growing by up to 80 percent a year.</p>
<p>"We did not expect a quick return from our Internet business, but the future is promising," said a manager with another local Internet service provider.</p>
<p>China's total PC sales are expected to reach three million units in 1997, compared with 1.8 million in 1996, official figures have shown.</p>
