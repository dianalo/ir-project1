<p>Nobel-prize winning scientist David Baltimore has been tapped to lead a reinvigorated drive to develop an AIDS vaccine at the National Institutes of Health, AIDS research sources said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Several scientists, inside and outside government, predicted that the formal announcement would be made by the NIH Office of AIDS research on Thursday at an annual advisory meeting.</p>
<p>However, some government officials cautioned that details of the appointment have to be worked out and the announcement could be delayed.</p>
<p>The NIH had no comment. Baltimore's office at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology did not return a telephone call.</p>
<p>The decision to bring in a leading scientist to oversee NIH vaccine research follows the recommendations made last March by a prominent panel of scientists, led by Princeton University's Arnold Levine, that reviewed and criticised aspect of NIH research.</p>
<p>NIH promised to swiftly act on the report, and agreed that vaccine research should be in centre-stage.</p>
<p>The search for a vaccine has been filled with setbacks and false starts. Levine's panel recommended a reinvigorated effort to develop an AIDS vaccine, particularly given the burst of discoveries about the basic workings of the AIDS virus that scientists have made in the past two years.</p>
<p>Most scientists and public health experts believe a vaccine is the only way to bring an end to the global epidemic, especially in poorer nations that are unable to afford the costly new cocktail of drugs that can suppress the virus in patients.</p>
<p>Baltimore, a Nobel prize winning expert in retroviruses, is one of the nation's most respected scientists. He is currently a professor at M.I.T. and was previously the president of The Rockefeller University in New York and the director of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research.</p>
<p>Sources said he would remain at the Boston university, but would spearhead NIH efforts to improve its vaccine development programme, ensuring that scientists at the various NIH institutes coordinate and that the best information from elsewhere in the nation is brought into the programme.</p>
