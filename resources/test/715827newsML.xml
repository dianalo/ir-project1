<p>Barclays Bank Plc International chairman Andrew Buxton arrived in Zimbabwe on Wednesday to review operations of his group's subsidiary, Barclays Zimbabwe, in the face of growing competition.</p>
<p>Barclays Zimbabwe is the southern African country's second largest commercial bank, but competition has tightened in the local financial sector with the establishment of five new banks in the last four years.</p>
<p>Buxton paid a courtesy call on President Robert Mugabe on arrival from Kenya, and told him that business here had been "very successful".</p>
<p>He is due to meet Zimbabwe Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa, central bank governor Leonard Tsumba and to have dinner with Vice-President Simon Muzenda during his four-day visit.</p>
<p>Buxton is also scheduled to open a new Barclays Bank branch in Chinhoyi town in northwestern Zimbabwe.</p>
