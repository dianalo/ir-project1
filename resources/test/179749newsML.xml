<p>Zambian police used teargas and batons to disperse scores of rioting students at the country's largest university on Monday, witnesses said.</p>
<p>A student leader was arrested and several others were slightly injured as police moved in to block a planned march to the presidential residence by students dissatisfied with plans for general elections scheduled for November 18.</p>
<p>The students had intended to call on President Frederick Chiluba to reopen dialogue with the opposition, and possibly suspend the polls until all political parties reached consensus on the rules to govern the elections.</p>
<p>The riot was the second in three days on the University of Zambia campus. On Saturday, 17 British Airways crew members were injured, some seriously, when rioting students attacked their bus with stones.</p>
<p>Four of the injured had to be flown to South Africa for specialist treatment. Police said the cause for the disturbance, in which students indiscriminately attacked vehicles on a road parallel to the campus, had not yet been established.</p>
<p>Student leaders said the riot was sparked by a hit-and-run road accident in which a student suffered a broken leg, dispelling speculation the violence was politically motivated.</p>
<p>Seven opposition parties, including former president Kenneth Kaunda's United National Independence Party (UNIP), are boycotting the polls which they claim have been arranged to ensure that the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) remains in power.</p>
<p>The parties are opposed to a new constitution that bans some candidates, including Kaunda, from contesting the presidential race. They are also unhappy with the voters' register, which reportedly omits 2.3 million of the 4.6 million eligible voters.</p>
<p>Western governments, which share the opposition concerns, have cut or frozen aid to Zambia in attempt to persuade the government to reverse the contentious constitutional clauses and reopen the voters register.</p>
<p>The Chiluba government has, however, dug in its heels and says it will not be dictated to by foreign governments.</p>
