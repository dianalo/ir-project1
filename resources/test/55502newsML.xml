<p>Romania extracted 573,462 tonnes of crude oil in August, little changed from July's 574,800 tonnes, the Industry Ministry said on Monday.</p>
<p>It said crude output last month was only 0.6 percent down from August 1995.</p>
<p>The Ministry's oil and gas department said August's natural gas extraction stood at around 1.27 billion cubic metres, almost unchanged from July, but was down 18.9 percent from the same month of the previous year.</p>
<p>Romania, where crude output has been on the slide from 1970s peaks of 14 million tonnes, plans to keep this year's extraction close to the 1995 level of 6.7 million tonnes (equivalent to around 135,000 barrels per day). But it will have to import oil to meet domestic consumption needs.</p>
<p>According to latest statistics, Romania imported 4.3 million tonnes (86,000 bpd) of crude in the first seven months of 1996.</p>
<p>In a bid to boost crude output, Romania has launched a licensing round for 15 onshore and offshore prospective oil blocks earlier this year.</p>
<p>Oil sector officials say some 50 oil operators have submitted bids so far, while others are expected to do so before an end-October deadline.</p>
<p>The National Agency for Mineral Resources is expected to announce successful bidders next January, with work on the blocks to become possible next June.</p>
