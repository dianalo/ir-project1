<p>Sugar freight inquiry stayed buoyant at the end of the week with charterers finding tonnage to fill a number of recent orders for usual runs, shipbrokers said on Friday.</p>
<p>New business included Brazilian shippers SIMAB, which quoted for 13,100 tonnes in bags from south Brazil to Egypt with Red Sea option for mid-October dates.</p>
<p>Louis Dreyfus was open on account for 7/8,000 tonnes, again in bags, from Paranagua to Colombo for around 10/15 October.</p>
<p>Czarnikow Rionda quoted for 14,000 tonnes of bagged sugar from Buenaventura to Abidjan for 20/30 October. Shipbrokers cited reports that Glencore fixed 13,500 tonnes in bags from Santos to the Egyptian Mediterranean/east Africa for 14/24 October at a rate thought to be close to $32.50.</p>
<p>Fiji Sugar Marketing was said to be closely working its order for 19,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Fiji to London for early November.</p>
<p>Mauritius Sugar Syndicate fixed 17,500/17,750 tonnes of bulk sugar from Port Louis to London for 21/24 October at very close to stg 14.00, after the stg 13.75 achieved for the last similar order, albeit a smaller tonnage.</p>
<p>The same charterer was also open for 15,200 tonnes min/max from Port Louis to Lisbon for 23/26 October.</p>
<p>Lastly, CSR fixed its recent order for 30,000 tonnes of bulk sugar from Queensland to Inchon for the end of October and was also said to be on subjects with 19,000 tonnes from the same origin to one or two ports in Japan for similar dates.</p>
