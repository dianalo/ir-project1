<p>Debt-ridden Bulgaria, hit by a severe wheat shortage, has delayed autumn sowing of wheat and barley due to lack of funds and incentives to farmers, an agriculture ministry official said on Tuesday</p>
<p>Georgi Spiridinov said only 20,000 hectares of wheat and 7,000 hectares of barley had been sown so far, while the country needs to sow 1.2 million ha with wheat and 300,000 ha with barley to cover domestic consumption.  </p>
<p>He attributed the delay in sowing mainly to a grim financial situation in Bulgarian farming strengthened by a record high rise in interest rates and blocked farmers' funds in banks, which were recently placed under special supervision.</p>
<p>"The farmers' lack of interest in the autumn sowing campaign is due to the high interest rate and the blocking of farmers' disposable funds in the banks under special supervision," Spiridonov told a news conference.  </p>
<p>Last week, in a bid to stabilise its crumbling currency and banks Bulgaria hiked annual interest rates to 300 percent and placed one quater of its banks under central bank supervision. As a result depositors now can not draw money from their accounts.</p>
<p>Spiridonov said poor weather conditions also had hindered sowing 500,000 ha already prepared for the autumn campaign.</p>
<p>He said there was not enough barley seed for sowing and only 60 percent of the needed 88,000 tonnes of it had been provided.</p>
<p>Last year Bulgaria sowed one million hectares with wheat and 270,000 ha with barley.</p>
<p>On Monday agriculture minister Krastyo Trendafilov said the credits of 16 billion levs for the sowing would be axed to five billion levs due to the high interest rate, eating them up.</p>
<p>Agriculture ministry estimates showed 77 billion levs would be needed for the autumn sowing and 25 billion out of them were expected to come from farmers.</p>
