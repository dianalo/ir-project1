<p>Artists Christo and his wife Jeanne-Claude, who wrapped Germany's past and future parliament building the Reichstag in glitzy silver fabric last year, unveiled their latest art projects on Monday.</p>
<p>At a presentation in Hamburg, the couple said they planned to cover the Arkansas River in the United States and erect tall gates in New York's Central Park. They had no dates set for when the projects would go ahead.</p>
<p>"Our projects are like babies. We plan them for their own sake," said Jeanne Claude, explaining that she and her Bulgarian-born husband did not set out to make a profit from their bizarre artistic projects.</p>
<p>"Over the River" would involve covering the Arkansas River in the state of Colorado with up to 10 km of bands of fabric placed across it, the New York-based artists told journalists.</p>
<p>There would be no damage to the environment because the nylon covering would be suspended a metre above the water and would make room for rocks, trees or bridges, they said.</p>
<p>"The Gates" would involve putting up several five-metre (15-foot) tall steel gates along Central Park's footpaths.</p>
<p>The couple said they never funded their projects with public money and would raise the money needed themselves.</p>
<p>The artists have earned notoriety over the years with bizarre projects like lining a stretch of Australian coastline in fabric, surrounding Florida islands in pink plastic and opening 3,000 blue and yellow umbrellas in Japan and California simultaneously.</p>
<p>Wrapping Berlin's historic Reichstag building last year took a week and fulfilled a long-standing dream for the couple.</p>
<p>The scheme had provoked strong opposition from Chancellor Helmut Kohl and conservatives, who felt it was disrespectful to a building which was inaugurated in 1894 as united Germany's parliament, gutted by fire in 1933 and heavily bombed in 1945.</p>
<p>The project was only narrowly approved in 1994 after a 70-minute debate in parliament.</p>
