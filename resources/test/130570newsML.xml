<p>President Lee Teng-hui pledged on Monday to reunify Taiwan with China but blamed the "stubborn policy" of the Communist mainland's leadership for a stalemate in once-warming relations.</p>
<p>Lee, addressing a meeting of the National Reunification Council, reiterated Taiwan's long-standing policy that reunification was a "historic mission".</p>
<p>The council is composed of ranking government officials, opposition leaders and independent scholars.</p>
<p>Lee criticised Beijing for a sharp downturn in what had been warming ties in June 1995 -- a setback that China blamed on Lee's visit to the United States.</p>
<p>"Last year could have been a major turning point for the development of national reunification. Regrettably, the Chinese Communist authorities did not realise the situation," Lee said.</p>
<p>"They adopted a hegemonic attitude and stubborn policy toward Taiwan, singlehandedly blocked the development of history and caused the stalemate of cross-Strait relations," Lee said.</p>
<p>Lee has regularly called on Beijing to acknowledge the existence of his estranged Republic of China government as a crucial step towards ending their half-century-old differences.</p>
<p>But a furious Beijing said Lee's U.S. visit proved that Lee actually coveted Taiwan's independence, not reunification.</p>
<p>China broke off semi-official talks with Taipei and rattled Taiwan with war games and missile tests in waters near the Nationalist-ruled island in the months before its first direct presidential elections in March, which Lee won by a landslide.</p>
<p>Lee said Taipei was committed to peaceful reunification, but that the interests of Taiwan's people must come first.</p>
<p>Taiwan is ruled by the government that lost a civil war to the Chinese Communists in 1949 and fled into exile on the island. Both sides say they want unification but under very different terms.</p>
<p>Beijing views Taiwan as a rebel-held province and vehemently opposes Taipei's effort to break its international isolation, threatening to retake the island by force if it opts for formal independence.</p>
<p>"Communist China's high-handed policy...will deepen meaningless misunderstandings and hostility. It is detrimental to the development of reunification," Lee said.</p>
<p>"The pursuit of China's reunification is our historic responsibility, but the security and welfare of the 21.3 million in Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen (Jinmen) and Matsu (Mazu) are the fundamental issues of our survival," Lee said, listing the four islands that since 1949 have resisted communist rule.</p>
<p>"Our mainland policy will be aimed at keeping our roots in Taiwan," Lee said.</p>
<p>Taipei and Beijing should tolerate and respect each other and step up communication and dialogue to create favourable conditions for reunification, Lee said.</p>
<p>On a softer tone, Lee reiterated his willingness to embark upon a "journey of peace" to China to meet with top leaders in Beijing for a direct exchange of views.</p>
<p>Beijing has given a cool response to Lee's proposal.</p>
