<p>The Italian Finance Ministry dismissed rumours on the Italian stock exchange that the next budget for 1997 would contain measures imposing a tax on the technical reserves of insurance companies.</p>
<p>"The Finance Ministry categorically denies that measures to tax the technical reserves of insurance companies are under consideration," a Ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>Insurance company stocks have fallen on the Milan market in recent days on speculation the budget would include such measures.</p>
<p>Italian ministers in the centre-left government start meetings on Tuesday to thrash out the critical 1997 financial package, due to contain 32.4 trillion lire of budget deficit cutting measures.</p>
<p>The package must be presented to parliament by the end of September and approved by parliament by the year end.</p>
