<title>USA: Christopher to hold news conference on resignation.</title>

<p>President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher are to hold a news conference on Thursday to confirm Christopher's resignation but were not expected to name a successor, officials said.</p>
<p>"I doubt a successor will be announced then," said one official, referring to a planned White House news conference at noon EST (1700 GMT).</p>
<p>Officials on Wednesday said Christopher had tendered his resignation but would remain in his post into January, probably until Clinton was inaugurated to a second term on Jan. 20 after winning re-election on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Christopher discussed his plans with Clinton on Tuesday in Little Rock, Arkansas, Clinton's hometown where his election night victory celebration was held. U.N. Ambassador Madeleine Albright and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell were considered leading candidates to succeed him.</p>
<p>Officials have increasingly seemed persuaded that Mitchell, a special presidential peace envoy to Northern Ireland, has an edge after helping Clinton prepare for pre-election debates with Dole.</p>
<p>Mitchell would have more expertise in dealing with Congress, a critical talent given the fact that opposition Republicans will again dominate both the House of Representatives and the Senate.</p>
<p>But Albright has more hands-on foreign policy experience and broader knowledge of foreign issues. She would be the first woman to serve in the top cabinet post.</p>
