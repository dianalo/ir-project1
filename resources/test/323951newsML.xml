<p>Former England coach Terry Venables has walked into the middle of pay dispute involving senior players in his first full week in charge of Australia's national team.</p>
<p>The trade union representing the Australia players threatened briefly to take strike action by refusing to let the players take the field in a friendly against Norway on Saturday, Venables' third match in charge, a Soccer Australia spokesman said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But the threat was quickly withdrawn after negotiations on Tuesday between Soccer Australia, the national ruling body, and the players' union, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>"We now have an understanding there will be no strike action affecting the match in Sydney on Saturday night," the spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Venables, who left his job with England after guiding them to the semifinals at last year's Euro '96, took control of Australia for the first time in their 1-0 win against New Zealand in Melbourne on Saturday.</p>
<p>Australia, minus all their overseas-based players, including Aston Villa goalkeeper Mark Bosnich, face South Korea in Brisbane on Wednesday in their second match as host of a four-nation tournament.</p>
<p>The players are seeking a 75 percent share of prizemoney for international matches and 20 percent of any appearance fee paid to Soccer Australia for playing overseas.</p>
<p>Their claim also includes a demand for between five and 10 percent of all sponsorship, broadcasting and merchandising rights involving the national team, Soccer Australia said.</p>
<p>At present, the players are only paid an undisclosed match fee and daily allowance, the ruling body said.</p>
<p>"The players are absolutely steadfast," Australian Soccer Players' Association president Kimon Taliadoros was quoted as saying in Melbourne's The Age newspaper on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"They are aware of their role in as far as generating revenue for Soccer Australia is concerned and they are entitled to an appropriate share of that revenue," Taliadoros added.</p>
<p>Soccer Australia said further negotiations between the two sides would take place next week, several days after Australia's last game in the tournament against Norway.</p>
<p>Venables, the former Barcelona and Tottenham Hotspur coach, has signed an 18-month contract to guide Australia's 1998 World Cup campaign.</p>
