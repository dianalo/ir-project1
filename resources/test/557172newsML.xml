<p>Germany's 16 regional states considerably exceeded their borrowing targets last year as a result of sharp shortfalls in tax revenues, the Bonn Finance Ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>Preliminary data show the states' 1996 total budget deficit was 47.3 billion marks, compared to a forecast 39.4 billion marks, making it necessary to enforce additional budget savings this year to qualify for Europe's planned single currency.  </p>
<p>The Finance Ministry said that higher state budget deficits could not be fully offset last year despite spending cuts, economic recovery, supplementary budgets and other measures.</p>
<p>"That is why it is necessary the federal and state governments strictly limit expenditure growth in order to achieve consolidation targets in light of the deficit criterion for Maastricht in 1997," it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Germany is in danger of exceeding the three percent limit on budget deficits this year, one of the key criterion to qualify for European economic and monetary union (EMU) in 1999.</p>
<p>The participants in EMU will be chosen early next year based on economic performance in 1997.</p>
