<headline>Turkey's Ciller says coalition to continue.</headline>
<dateline>ANKARA 1997-04-28</dateline>

<p>Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Tansu Ciller said on Monday her coalition with Islamists would continue despite a row over the role of Islam in public life since the alliance came to power.</p>
<p>"We will continue to work with stability," Ciller told reporters after meeting Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan.  </p>
<p>Two ministers from Ciller's True Path Party (DYP) resigned at the weekend as a result of Erbakan's reluctance to meet military demands for a crackdown on Islamist activism.</p>
<p>He signed a communique by the military-dominated National Security Council on Saturday agreeing to go ahead with measures including the extension of secularist education at the expense of religious schools.</p>
<p>But Erbakan's Islam-based Welfare Party, afraid of losing grassroots support, is expected to oppose the education changes in parliament.</p>
<p>Ciller and Erbakan formed a coalition last June after the failure of a secularist right-wing coalition.</p>
