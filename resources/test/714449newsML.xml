<p>Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel left under a cloud on Tuesday for a key NATO summit in Madrid after a string of alleged blunders prompted opposition parties to bring a no-confidence vote against him.</p>
<p>Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party, the Greens and the Liberal Forum have teamed up to stage a vote of no confidence on Friday against Schuessel, who is also leader of the conservative People's Party and Vice-Chancellor.</p>
<p>Embattled Schuessel, 52, has been driven into a corner by media and political pressure since the German weekly magazine Focus alleged that he called Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer "a real pig" at a recent European Union summit in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>Schuessel has denied the accusations.</p>
<p>The dominant Social Democrats of Chancellor Viktor Klima, who rule in coalition with the People's Party, say they will not back a no confidence motion.</p>
<p>Schuessel, who has been Foreign Minister since 1995, came in for a tough grilling at a special question session in parliament on Tuesday to debate the theme of "The behaviour of the Austrian government abroad".</p>
<p>Freedom Party chief whip Ewald Stadler accused him of making Austria look ridiculous and said his ability to represent Austria in Europe had plunged to nil.</p>
<p>Liberal Forum leader Heidi Schmidt joined in the fray, saying: "When the credibility of a foreign minister at home is so badly damaged, that has an impact abroad too...and he does not carry the necessary weight as foreign minister."</p>
<p>However, Schuessel insisted that the last word was with the voters and that he would not pay attention to criticism levelled at him by the media and fellow politicians.</p>
<p>"It's a particularly Austrian habit to make Austria (look) bad abroad," Schuessel said at the rowdy parliament session.</p>
<p>Klima said he saw "no sign that the government's ability to do conduct its affairs abroad had been limited".</p>
<p>Austrian media said Schuessel's alleged outburst was triggered by a row between German Finance Minister Theo Waigel and the Bundesbank over the Bonn government's plans to revalue the central bank's gold reserves.</p>
<p>Schuessel strenuously denied the report by journalists at the summit and flew to Frankfurt to reassure Tietmeyer of his innocence, but this only provoked calls for his resignation by fellow politicians who alleged that he had lied.</p>
<p>National media reports also allege the outspoken minister called Swedish Prime Minister Goran Person an "idiot", U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright an "old Bette Davis" and Edith Cresson, French former prime minister and EU commissioner, an "old bag".</p>
<p>Schuessel, who sports a trademark bow tie and red-rimmed glasses, is an ardent supporter of Austrian NATO entry, which has put him at odds with his government coalition partners.</p>
<p>The Social Democrats have traditionally opposed relinquishing Austria's neutrality and say that a referendum must be held before the nation joins any military alliance.</p>
