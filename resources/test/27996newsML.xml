<p>Mexico will be at the epicentre of emerging markets activity this week but investors will be searching for clues from key U.S. employment figures, due out on Friday, to future U.S. monetary policy.</p>
<p>"The key issue will be the U.S. employment report on Friday and its effect on the longbond," said one London-based analyst.</p>
<p>Markets will be cautious ahead of August employment figures after signs of a strong pickup in U.S. economic growth last week stoked speculation of a rise in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>"The market has had a good has had a good run. It makes you wonder if things can continue," West Merchant Bank economic adviser Peter West said.</p>
<p>MEXICO will be a key focus as investors digest President Ernesto Zedillo's upbeat address to the nation, delivered on Sunday, and monitor the impact of a resurgence of leftwing guerrilla violence.</p>
<p>"The rally in Mexico will lead the rest of Latin American (Bradys) up," said Jerome Booth, ANZ Grindlays head of emerging markets research.</p>
<p>In  his speech, Zedillo declared Mexico's economic crisis was over, though he warned that it would be a long time before ordinary Mexicans felt the benefit in their living standards.</p>
<p>Investors said enthusiasm for Mexico should continue on the back of robust second-quarter GDP growth of 7.2 percent.</p>
<p>"The GDP growth was above expectations, indicating a general recovery and the end of the recession," said Booth.</p>
<p>Despite the rosy economic outlook, markets - wary over the strength of the Mexican peso - will remain cautious on mounting leftwing guerrilla violence.</p>
<p>But because of Mexico's constructive economic and political outlook, investors are unlikely to panic, said analysts.</p>
<p>"It's just noise. The political situation is stable. And the economic programme is working," said ANZ economist Jerome Booth.</p>
<p>Over 12 were killed in Mexico following surprise leftists guerrilla attacks, the worst in over two years, last week.</p>
<p>The attacks, which appeared closely coordinated, marked the most serious fighting in Mexico since the Zapatista rebellion erupted in the southeastern state of Chiapas in January 1994.</p>
<p>In ARGENTINA, markets will await consumer wholesale prices on Tuesday but debt prices should remain underpinned by improving economic sentiment.</p>
<p>Markets will also follow the progress of fiscal reforms, aimed at reversing the widening budget deficit which hit $2.5 billion by mid-year, through Congress.</p>
<p>The government has said the deficit would have swelled to $6.6 billion by year-end without the measures, expected to be approved by Congress in early October.</p>
<p>"I am encouraged by recent developments in Argentina. And do think there will be more cooperation from Congress," said Booth.</p>
<p>RUSSIA will also bask in the spotlight this week but debt prices could remain under pressure on concerns over President Boris Yeltsin's health.</p>
<p>Investors said a visit to Russia by German Chancellor Helmut Kohl will place the spotlight firmly back on Yeltsin's health.</p>
<p>Investor confidence in VENEZUELA, hit after setbacks to the privatisation programme last week, will remain an issue.</p>
<p>But some investors recommend buying on the dips if Venezuelan Bradys and stocks take a dive.</p>
<p>"If there is profittaking, one ought to buy on weakness," said West Merchant Bank's West.</p>
<p>"The ecomomic situation is for an improving outlook from a weak base. The economy is at the bottom of the cycle and we should see a recovery in activity next year," he added.</p>
<p>The International Finance Corporation index on Latin America was down 0.6 percent at 524.72 from the previous Friday.</p>
<p>Asia was up 0.1 percent on the week at 251.47, and Europe, Middle East and Africa was quoted up 2.8 percent on the week at 137.26.</p>
