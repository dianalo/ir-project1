<p>Early scrutiny of the results of Argentina's October unemployment survey show joblessness stuck at about the same level as in May, the Economy Minister's chief advisor was quoted as saying Monday.</p>
<p>"There are no big changes in the October unemployment rate," Carlos Rodriguez, top advisor to Economy Minister Roque Fernandez, told Ambito Financiero.</p>
<p>The last measurement in May showed unemployment at 17.1 percent.  Rodriguez said that analysis of the results of the October survey began only two days ago.</p>
<p>But Rodriguez said that joblessness should begin to fall by the time of the next survey in May 1997.</p>
