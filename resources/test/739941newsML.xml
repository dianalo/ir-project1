<p>U.S. agriculture giant Cargill will invest a total of $300 million in Turkey to build a hi-tech plant to produce fructose, benefiting from an newly-planned incentive package for foreign capital, a Turkish government official said on Friday.  </p>
<p>"The government is preparing a change in the legislation on foreign capital investments to give them incentives," said the official, who declined to be named.</p>
<p>"Cargill will initially invest $100 million in a fructose plant and the amount will be raised to $300 million in five years," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said such foreign capital investments would benefit from the new legislation, which would allow for cheaper inputs like electricity in production.</p>
<p>Officials said the change in the legislation was held up by the former coalition government between Islamists and conservatives, replaced last month by a secular three-party coalition that vowed to promote a free market economy.</p>
<p>According to the preliminary plans, the plant is envisaged to process 800 tonnes of corn a day to produce fructose, a natural sweetener derived from corn and used in soft drinks.</p>
<p>The plant will be built in Aslanbey region in Izmit province, to the east of Istanbul.</p>
