<p>Nebraska feedlot cattle markets were inactive following Tuesday's active sales, market sources said.</p>
<p>"There were no trades because for all intents and purposes there's nothing left to sell," one source said.</p>
<p>About 80,000 head sold Tuesday at $112.00 per cwt on a dressed basis and $70.00 on a cash basis, both up $2.00 from last week's top prices.</p>
<p>This week's showlist was estimated at 70,000 to 76,000 head. Sharply higher beef prices fueled the active packer demand, they said.</p>
