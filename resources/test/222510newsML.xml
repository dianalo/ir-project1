<p>Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov renewed attacks on President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday over his decision to pull the last Russian troops out of rebel Chechnya, but did not say if he would back moves to impeach him.</p>
<p>Zyuganov told a news conference that opposition communist members of the State Duma lower house of parliament would meet at noon (0900 GMT) on Friday to consider their position, hours before an emergency Duma session called to discuss the decision.</p>
<p>Some communists and nationalists say the withdrawal, announced last Saturday, amounts to acceptance of Chechen demands for independence and could start the slow break-up of Russia. They have threatened to start impeachment procedures.</p>
<p>"The question is whether Russia faces the same fate as our former Soviet Union," Zyuganov said, referring to the superpower which broke up in 1991.</p>
<p>"Our faction will meet tomorrow at noon to consider... events connected with the crimes in Chechnya."</p>
<p>He declined to respond directly to questions on whether his faction, the biggest in the Duma, would back any calls to impeach the president during Friday's emergency session.</p>
<p>But, suggesting he did not favour such moves personally, he said: "The president is ill, let him get well."</p>
<p>Zyuganov also did not say whether the communists would seek a no-confidence vote in the government over its policies on Chechnya and the economy. He has recently indicated that he does not favour a no-confidence vote at this stage.</p>
<p>Yegor Stroyev, chairman of the Federation Council upper chamber, said after talks with Zyuganov that he did not believe the communists would try to impeach Yeltsin.</p>
<p>All previous attempts to impeach Yeltsin have collapsed and any new effort would have little chance of success.</p>
