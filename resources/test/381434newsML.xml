<p>Pakistan's Ministry of Food and Agriculture said it had opened eight bids on Sunday after its side-by-side tender for 450,000 tonnes of U.S. or Australian wheat, but had made no decision.</p>
<p>Mehboob Ahmed, secretary at the ministry, said a committee was studying the bids and would make its final recommendations on Sunday evening. "I expect a decision by tomorrow," he added.</p>
<p>Another official said there had been no bids for the supply of Australian wheat. All eight bids were for U.S. soft white wheat, with the lowest at $152 per tonne and the highest about $158 per tonne.</p>
<p>"It seems all of them (bidders) will get something because they are all close to each other (in price)," he added.</p>
