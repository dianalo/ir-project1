<p>Hungary's privatisation agency APV Rt transferred 1.407 billion forints to Danubius Hotels under the 1989 privatisation law, Danubius said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"This is a significant part of the 20 percent plus interest (due to the company) from the privatisation income," Danubius said. "We are negotiating about the payout of the remaining part," it added.</p>
<p>The payout by APV comes under a 1989 law which promised state-owned companies which transformed themselved into shareholder companies before 1992 that they would receive 20 percent of all subsequent privatisation revenues.</p>
<p>Danubius is the second after chemicals TVK among the bourse listed companies to receive payments by APV.</p>
<p>Analysts said earlier that the payments may affect several of the Budapest Stock Exchange's leading companies, including oil and gas company MOL, pharmaceuticals Egis, tile maker Zalakeramia, meat processor Pick and OTP Bank.</p>
