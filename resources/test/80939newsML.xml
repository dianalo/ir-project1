<p>High sulphur cracked fuel oil came under some bearish pressure today as dealers talked of a concerted effort to push prices lower by certain players.</p>
<p>But while prices were seen steady to marginally softer, the fundamental lack of product in the region should prevent a dramatic fall, traders said.</p>
<p>A high sulphur cargo out of Scandinavia for early October was heard offered at $107 fob NWE compared with $110 last Friday. One trader said there had been offers as low as $112 cif NWE, but other dealers said stocks in the NWE are not high and that two utility shorts will have to be met next week.  </p>
<p>Low sulphur cracked cargoes were assessed unchanged around $118-120 fob NWE. Two deals done on Wednesday out of ARA were both headed into the main Med buyer. One was at high fob NWE +$1.50 the other at an unconfirmed mid cif NWE quotes delivered.</p>
<p>On Thursday a trader was thought to have picked up a very high density 30 kt cargo at $116.50 fob NWE and demand was understood to remain on behalf of a trader looking for blending material.</p>
<p>The high and low sulphur barge markets were very quiet with only one trade seen at $113 fob ARA.</p>
