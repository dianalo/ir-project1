<p>The German stock market looks set to receive massive investments by private pension funds aiming to make good the inadequacies of the fragile state pension system.</p>
<p>Most analysts say that the state system is in dire need of a radical overhaul, and the private pension route is the most effective way to deal with the multi-billion-mark funding problem.</p>
<p>Rolf Passow, head of the German investment funds association BVI, says that once German investors realise the limitations of the state pension scheme, there will be a change in how people view investment funds.</p>
<p>"The move from state pension provision to private pension provision will probably not happen in this century, but you will be able to see a change in trend over the next few months," Passow, the head of Dresdner Bank's investment arm DIT, told Reuters recently.</p>
<p>The BVI said that total funds under management in Germany could hit a trillion marks by the year 2000, with equity-based funds the growth leaders in the sector.</p>
<p>The growth in equity-backed funds is evidence of a changing investment structure in Germany, as many younger investors set up their own savings plans to top-up their pensions, in advance of any Government decision to open up the pension system.</p>
<p>Traditionally German investors have favoured fixed return or low risk products, such as bond-backed investment funds.</p>
<p>However, younger German investors have taken note of the success of unit trust-linked products in Britain and the mutual fund industry in the United States.</p>
<p>As the German pension system currently stands, retirees receive a pension equivalent to just over 70 percent of their net wage income after 45 years of contributions.</p>
<p>Actuaries forecast that contributions would have to increase to 25.5 percent from 20.3 percent currently by 2040 to maintain these levels.</p>
<p>The German pension system is split into three parts. The mainstay of the current system is the state pension, which accounts for 70 percent of total pension payments.</p>
<p>As yet there is no tax relief for investors seeking to save for a pension outside the state or the company system, but pension firms are lobbying for tax relief for private pension savers.</p>
<p>A Bonn coalition policy group said recently that Germany needs to cut pensions, raise contributions and set up a tax-financed "family fund" to keep its state pensions scheme going into the 21st century.</p>
<p>Long-term, however, most analysts see no option to secure retirees' future income other than introducing tax relief on contributions to private pension plans.</p>
<p>Such a solution would act as a green light for both domestic and foreign private pension providers to move in to the market.</p>
<p>Gerhard Grebe, senior economist at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt, says: "When the money from private pension funds finally does filter into the German stock market, it will appreciably boost the values of existing shares."</p>
<p>It will take some time for the impact of a change in the pensions structure to kick in on the DAX, but analysts also agree that Germany's stock market will benefit strongly from any changes.</p>
<p>"It will take a while for changes in the pension system to be felt in the share markets. Even when the private pension system is introduced, it will take five to ten years for the critical mass to build up," says Evi Vogl, of Hypo-Bank's funds unit, allfonds management.</p>
<p>"We will definitely see an increase in demand (for shares) and also we will see a decrease in volatility on the share market at a higher level. At the same time the capital market basis has to be expanded," says Vogl.</p>
<p>"Parallel to that, market entry criteria for smaller and mid-cap companies has to be made easier to put the share market on a wider basis in Germany," says Vogl.</p>
