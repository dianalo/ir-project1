<p>North Carolina voters said the federal government was overstepping its bounds by trying to regulate cigarettes in an attempt to curb underage smoking, a survey released on Thursday said.</p>
<p>The survey, a Mason-Dixon poll funded by Philip Morris and released by the Tobacco Growers Association of North Carolina, found 62 percent of voters agreed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's plan to assert jurisdiction over cigarettes goes too far in restricting an adult's right to smoke.  </p>
<p>"Our industry is on the dart board, and the federal government is continuing to throw darts," said Keith Parrish, a tobacco grower.</p>
<p>Philip Morris, the largest tobacco producer, faced off with the FDA in a North Carolina court earlier this month seeking to block the agency from regulating the product.</p>
<p>On August 23, President Bill Clinton authorized the FDA to regulate the sale and marketing of cigarettes in an effort to curb smoking among children.</p>
<p>But voters feared the plan could lead to the prohibition of tobacco products in this country, the poll said.  </p>
<p>"We see the FDA plan as an attack on a legal product that could put many people out of work, especially those in the tobacco industry," Charlie Harvey, executive vice president of the Tobacco Growers Association of North Carolina, said.</p>
<p>"Money raised from growing tobacco has fed our families and has sent our children to college. If these FDA regulations are imposed they will threaten our livelihoods," he added.</p>
<p>The state, which leads the country in tobacco production, harvested $1.05 billion worth of tobacco last year, according to North Carolina Department of Agriculture.</p>
