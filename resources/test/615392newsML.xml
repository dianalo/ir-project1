<p>The death toll from a shopping centre fire and riot in this East Kalimantan city on the island of Borneo has risen to 142, the local Dinamika Berita reported on Monday.</p>
<p>The paper quoted officials as saying the remains of at least 136 people had been found in a search of the gutted the Mitra Plaza shopping centre after the complex caught fire following an election-related riot.</p>
<p>Senior police were not immediately available on Monday to confirm the report. Some shops have started to re-open, but a number of streets remained closed as troops and police remained on guard ahead of Thursday's poll.</p>
<p>Dinamika Berita said the remains were mostly charred bones and appeared to almost exclusively male.</p>
<p>Officials had said all the shop assistants, most of whom were female, were sent home soon after riots started in the early afternoon when the town's shops closed up.</p>
<p>Another two bodies had been found in both the Lima Cahaya shopping complex and Sarikaya supermarket, while two people died as a result of stabbing wounds, it added.</p>
<p>Most of the bodies in the Mitra Plaza were found in the Siola department store, many with sharp weapons nearby, while others were located in a Hero Supermarket, Gramedia bookstore, Texas Fried Chicken and Century 21 cinema.</p>
<p>Authorities have said that the victims, who entered the building and set it alight after dark when the city was blackedout, were all looters trapped by the flames after they stayed in the building after riot police and troops quickly flown into the city began to patrol the streets.</p>
<p>Dinamika Berita quoted unnamed officials as saying they expected the death toll to rise as they say they have not yet had an opportunity to search the Hotel Kalimantan and the Jujung Buih shopping complex below it in the city centre.</p>
<p>The Banjarmasin Post reported on Monday that 164 had been reported missing to city police who had detained 181 people, mostly on looting related crimes.</p>
<p>Both Indonesia's cabinet secretary Saadillah Mursid  and the chairman of the Indonesian Council of Ulemas Hasan Basri were staying in the central four-star Hotel Kalimantan when the riot started but both men were escorted to saftey by police on Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>The riot began on Friday as supporters of the Moslem-oriented United Development Party (PPP) began to intercept and harass people on their way to a rally of the ruling Golkar party on the final day of Indonesia's violence plagued election campaign.</p>
<p>Residents said Moslems were angry that Golkar supporters had started noisy parades before Islamic prayers at midday on Friday.</p>
