<p>The United Arab Emirates on Monday approved its 1997 federal budget, projecting spending of 19.86 billion dirhams and revenue of 18.87 billion, the official news agency WAM reported.</p>
<p>It said the budget, which forecast a deficit of 987 million dirhams, was approved by the cabinet. Last year's budget had projected spending of 18.25 billion dirhams and revenue of 17.40 billion in the oil-rich Gulf Arab state.  </p>
<p>The agency did not say at what oil price the new budget was based on. The UAE is a major oil producer with an OPEC quota of 2.161 million bpd. Its annual oil income is estimated at $9 billion.</p>
<p>The seven emirates which make up the UAE do not release separate budgets.</p>
<p>Bankers estimate the country's federal budget represents only one third of real consolidated spending of all the emirates.</p>
