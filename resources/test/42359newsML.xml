<p>Shares of Star Entertainment (International Holdings) Ltd surged despite dilution fears after the company proposed a HK$268.8 million rights issue plan on the basis of eight rights shares for one existing share.</p>
<p>"Market makers were trying to boost the price to increase the attractiveness of the rights issue," said a dealing director at a local brokerage. "Speculation of possible asset injections into the company after the cash call also aided buying."</p>
<p>The shares rose HK$0.10, or 18.52 percent, to a morning high of HK$0.64 before steadying at HK$0.63 in late morning on volume of 31.12 million shares.</p>
<p>Star Entertainment said earlier on Monday that proceeds of the issue would be used to finance film production, to secure distribution rights, to finance or purchase rights to distribute TV drama series and to build a video library.</p>
<p>Brokers said the shares could come under selling pressure in the medium run due to the significant dilution effect resulting from the rights issue.</p>
