<p>Mother Teresa is being treated free of charge at an Indian heart clinic that is sophisticated enough to do heart transplants, officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa's faltering heart has focused attention on an imposing six-storey structure in the heart of India's eastern city of Calcutta, better known for teeming slums than aseptic medical care.</p>
<p>The B.M. Birla Heart Research Centre is treating the revered missionary free as a mark of respect for her work of compassion and caring, a clinic official told Reuters.</p>
<p>"We are bearing the entire medical expenses," Birla administrator S.K. Tiwari said. "She is an important person. She has done such a lot of good work."</p>
<p>Last week Mother Teresa, 86, underwent surgery to clear two blocked arteries. She appeared to be getting better when longstanding lung troubles and kidney difficulties resurfaced.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa's doctors said she has since improved. But her heart beat was still irregular and she remained in critical condition.</p>
<p>Her vital signs were being monitored round-the-clock by two people in the intensive therapy unit on the first floor of the hospital.</p>
<p>Tiwari said the care Mother Teresa had so far received would cost far more than the 105,000-rupee ($2,900) price tag an ordinary patient would pay for two weeks of similar treatment.</p>
<p>Woodlands hospital, where Mother Teresa was treated before being moved to the heart clinic, also waived its charges.</p>
<p>At the Birla clinic, Mother Teresa underwent an angiography followed by an angioplasty, as well as additional intensive care to deal with her complications relating to her age.</p>
<p>Angiography uses an X-ray and opaque dye to check for blockages in blood vessels. Angioplasty uses an inflatable balloon to unblock blood vessels.</p>
<p>The Birla clinic has performed an estimated 15,000 angiograms and angioplasties since opening in 1989, Tiwari said. It has also conducted 6,000 heart bypass operations.</p>
<p>The clinic stands on Calcutta's National Library Road, an upper-class area that seems a world apart from the squalor of the slums where Mother Teresa has spent most of her life.</p>
<p>Facing the clinic is Command House, the residence of the top army officer in eastern India.</p>
<p>The team of doctors treating Mother Teresa is led by the Birla centre's clinical director, Dr D.P. Shetty.</p>
<p>"Dr Shetty did our first open heart bypass surgery when the centre opened in May 1989," said Tiwari. "That first patient is still alive. We often invite him to hospital functions."</p>
<p>Tiwari said there were about 16 heart specialists permanently attached to the clinic. More than 50 others offer their services as visiting staff.</p>
<p>He said the 150-bed hospital was set up at a cost of 350 million rupees ($10 million). It is run by a group that also runs the nearby Calcutta Hospital, a general hospital with 400 beds and about 1,000 staff.</p>
<p>"We have the facilities to do heart transplants," Tiwari said. "But the government is not giving us permission to do so. We have applied many times."</p>
<p>Heart transplants are still a thorny subject for many Indians. The procedure is caught in a complex tangle of legal and ethical issues.</p>
