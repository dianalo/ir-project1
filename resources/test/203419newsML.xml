<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Wednesday it welcomed Belgium's economic reforms, but warned that unemployment would remain high in the long-term.</p>
<p>"Economic activity is continuing to accelerate," the IMF said in a statement, adding that inflation was well under control and the external current account remained very strong.</p>
<p>But the IMF made no mention of Belgium's massive debts and measures to reduce them -- crucial if the country is to qualify to join its European Union partners in creating a single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>The IMF forecast GDP to rise by 1.4 percent in 1996 and 2.2-2.5 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>It urged Belgium to press ahead with labour market reforms and to focus on the employment implications of wage settlements.</p>
<p>"With appropriate wage moderation, employment should expand and unemployment decrease over the course of the next two years, but long-term unemployment will remain at a very high level," the IMF said.</p>
<p>It added that incentives needed to be strengthened to increase flexibility of the labour market, while maintaining an adequate social safety net.</p>
<p>"Key reforms should include more flexible wage contracts: further targeted cuts in employers' social security contributions; stronger training; a moderation of severance payments to reduce the deterrent to new hiring," it said.</p>
