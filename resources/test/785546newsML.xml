<p>A spokesman for Grand Union said "less than a handful" of suppliers had pulled the plug on deliveries to the supermarket giant amid concerns about its ability to meet its debt obligations.</p>
<p>"There's less than a handful of other suppliers who have been frightened by the media reports -- that are not necessarily true -- that have ceased some terms but we are working with them to get those terms back in order," said Donald Vaillancourt, vice president of communications at Grand Union.</p>
