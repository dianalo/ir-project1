<p>The acquisition by Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton) of a controlling stake in British sports car maker Group Lotus Ltd is a strategic move which would turn the Malaysian car maker into an international player, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Proton on Wednesday announced the company and its key shareholder, Yahaya Ahmad, have bought an 80 percent stake in Lotus for 51 million pounds ($82.88 million).</p>
<p>Proton bought a 63.75 percent stake or 6.375 million Lotus shares for 38 million pounds, and Yahaya acquired 16.25 percent or 1.625 million shares for 13 million pounds.</p>
<p>Yahaya, dubbed Malaysia's car czar for his wide-ranging interests in the domestic automotive industry, is the controlling shareholder and chairman of Proton.</p>
<p>"It's a very strategic buy. The deal is very positive for Proton in terms of technology transfer and bringing Proton into the luxury sports car sector," said Patrick Lim, automotive analyst at Jupiter Securities.</p>
<p>"It will also make Proton an international player," he said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the deal would give the Malaysian maker the advanced engine technology it had long sought.</p>
<p>"Proton does not have the technology to build its own engine, but through this deal it could secure the technology to do so," said an analyst.</p>
<p>Lim said he believed Proton may use Lotus technology to make its own sports car model.</p>
<p>Proton said in the statement that it was planning to extend its product range and capabilities to ensure its continued progression in world markets. "The timing is ideal as Proton can draw from Lotus its rich experience in engineering and also its immense research and development capabilities," it said.</p>
<p>Proton said the acquisition would be funded from internally generated funds. Analysts said the deal should not have much effect on Proton's bottom line.</p>
<p>The group's pre-tax profit for the financial year to March 31, 1996 amounted to 454.6 million ringgit ($181.8 million).</p>
<p>Lotus was taken over by General Motors Corp in 1986, and then piled up losses of 50 million pounds in the five years before its sale in 1993 to Bugatti International.</p>
<p>(1 pound = $1.6350. $1 = 2.5 ringgit)</p>
