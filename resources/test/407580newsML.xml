<p>House Commerce committee ranking member John Dingell said Thursday he supports the Securities and Exchange Commission's probe into alleged abuses of "soft-dollar" practices.</p>
<p>In a letter to SEC chairman Arthur Levitt, the Michigan Democrat wrote to request a full report of the results of the regulatory agency's examination of the practices.</p>
<p>"Given the significant importance of this issue to the integrity of the markets and your protection of investors, please provide us with a comprehensive report on the results of review of soft-dollar practices," Dingell wrote.  </p>
<p>Last month in Tucson, Az., Levitt voiced concerns about brokers paying so-called "soft dollars" to money managers who bring in business -- a practice some call "frequent flyer miles of the brokerage business."</p>
<p>Brokers who provide soft-dollar services typically set aside a percentage of the commissions charged for trades as a credit or rebate that may be used by customers to buy soft dollar services.</p>
<p>Although the practice is not illegal, federal authorities are concerned that fees are not always used to pay for costs associated with investment decisions.</p>
<p>"As you know, soft dollars have become big business (by estimates, $1 billion annually) and abuses have multipled amid growing evidence of harm to the investing public," Dingell wrote in the letter dated February 27.</p>
<p>While Dingell concurs with calls for toughening disclosure rules, he pointed out the SEC last November withdrew a proposal that would have required investment advisers to provide an annual report to clients regarding their soft-dollar practices.</p>
