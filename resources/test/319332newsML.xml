<p>A Labour government would expand the reach of public/private partnerships as part of a long-term restructuring of public spending, the party's economics spokesman, Gordon Brown, said on Monday.</p>
<p>"Inside the Treasury we will establish a new public/private taskforce. It will report to a minister whose responsibility will be to set priorities and drive the process forward," Brown said in a keynote speech.</p>
<p>He said Labour would also look at the barriers that prevent public/private partnerships from working effectively in local government.</p>
<p>"Just as local government must be seen to be using its capital assets efficiently, so too we will place an onus on central government departments to justify their use of assets and seek partnerships with the private sector where appropriate," Brown said.</p>
<p>He said Whitehall's new system of resource accounting, which Labour supports, would greatly assist in this process.</p>
