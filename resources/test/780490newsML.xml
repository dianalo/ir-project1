<p>Japan said on Tuesday it and the United States should adopt "realistic" positions in their ongoing aviation talks and set aside the issue of open skies for the time being.</p>
<p>"It's important that discussions proceed putting aside (the open skies problem). I hope for a realistic approach," Transport Minister Makoto Koga told reporters.</p>
<p>The two countries entered the second day of three days of talks on Tuesday, after agreeing last month to strike an interim air deal by the end of September.</p>
<p>Koga said he had held high expectations for this first round of formal talks but that discussions had taken a step backward after U.S. negotiators hardened their stance.</p>
<p>"It looks like we are back at the starting line again," he said.</p>
<p>A Japanese government official said on Monday that the United States had said it would only recognise an upgrading of All Nippon Airways rights if Japan agreed in principle to open skies, the U.S.-led policy of a free market for international air travel.</p>
<p>He also said U.S. negotiators had raised their demands for the number of new routes to be given to U.S. carriers with lesser rights under the current treaty, demanding twice the number of routes requested in informal talks earlier this year.</p>
