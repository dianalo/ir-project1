<p>Australian bonds underperformed against the dollar bloc, giving up most of the spread narrowing seen last week as the market took a cautionary stance ahead of the first of this week's major events on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The Australian Industrial Relations Commission is finally due to hand down a verdict on the "living wage" claim.</p>
<p>If median A$12 per week expectations are met, this will be taken positively by the market as it will not put undue pressure on futures wages growth.</p>
<p>The second stage of key data will be on Wednesday when the March quarter CPI report is release, and again a benign outcome is forecast by economists.  </p>
<p>"If we can keep our inflation below the U.S. and the U.S. starts to rise, I think that would be the bullish scenairo for bonds and spreads could actually narrow a bit further," said David Landsley, Treasury economist at National Australia Bank.</p>
<p>Forecasts centre on a 0.1 percent rise in headline CPI to year-on-year 1.2 percent and 0.4 percent growth on the underlying rate to 2.1 percent.</p>
<p>The Australian/U.S. 10-year bond yield spread dropped to around 90 basis points last week as the market corrected the advance to 120-130 basis points seen earlier this year and in anticipation of favourable wages and price outcomes.  </p>
