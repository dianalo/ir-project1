<title>INDONESIA: Indonesian rupiah steady in late trading.</title>
<headline>Indonesian rupiah steady in late trading.</headline>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah was steady against the dollar in late trading after fluctuating violently in the morning on spill-over from Malaysia, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said market talk that the Bank Negara of Malaysia had asked local banks to stop quoting tom/next to offshore parties prompted foreigners to swamp the Jakarta swap market.</p>
<p>Swap rates jumped but spot dollar tumbled, reflecting offshore fears of possible liquidity squeeze, dealers said.</p>
<p>However, the market had stabilised in the afternoon and the rupiah returned to its initial ranges after Bank Indonesia (BI) denied it would make any similar changes.  </p>
<p>Bambang Trianto, director of the central bank's foreign exchange department, told Reuters that BI had no plan like that of Thailand whose central bank asked Thai banks to stop quoting tom/next swaps to offhshore investors.</p>
<p>"We have no intention to freeze the swap facility for now," Trianto said. "But we are watching the market very closely."</p>
<p>"We are comfortable with market rates," Trianto added.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was at 2,438.0/41.0 at 0920 GMT after leaping to a high of 2,413 from an opening of 2,444.0/45.0.</p>
<p>Swap rates also softened across the board although they remained expensive compared with pre-shock covering.  </p>
<p>Tom/next swaps were last at 0.45 points after soaring to a high of 7.0 points, equivalent to about 100 percent interest.</p>
<p>One-month swap was last at 22.0/24.0, three at 48.0/49.0 and six at 91.0/93.0 points.</p>
<p>Dealers said the rupiah was likely to soften next week on short-covering because of a public holiday in Singapore on Wednesday and in Jakarta on Thursday.</p>
<p>One local bank dealer said the ongoing election campaign would continue to linger on the financial markets including the rupiah because it had became increasingly violent.  </p>
<p>"Many got burnt today who went long on dollars Thursday. It was a really wild swing. I got in one screen quoting swaps at 30 while on the other screen at 60. There were a lot of arbitrage opportunity," the dealer said. "It was very choppy this morning."</p>
<p>Some banks in Jakarta said they made handsome gains on Friday trading on the swap market.</p>
<p>"I sold a lot of swaps this morning. We did a lot of arbitrage through the cheap money market," one Japanese bank dealer said, adding that people in Jakarta had no problem with liquidity while offshore players have to go through swaps.  </p>
<p>The central bank raised its intervention band by one point to 2,409/2,601 but lowered the conversion band to 2,409/2,457 on Friday. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364</p>
