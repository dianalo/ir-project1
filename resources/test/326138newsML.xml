<p>Leaders of Italy's three big trade union federations will meet Prime Minister Romano Prodi on Friday to discuss a long-standing metal and engineering workers dispute.</p>
<p>"Friday's meeting will be between the unions and the government," CISL union federation leader Sergio D'Antoni told a news conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>D'Antoni said whether the employers federation Confindustria later joined in the talks would depend on the outcome of the meeting between the unions and the government.</p>
<p>The unions had asked Prodi to intervene in the pay dispute, which has been dragging on since June.</p>
<p>In December, the government suggested that management give workers an average 200,000-lire per month pay increase.</p>
<p>Unions, which had been seeking a 230,000 lire increase, accepted the proposals but Federmeccanica, the sector's employers organisation, refused it as inflationary.</p>
<p>"We need the meeting to understand why the employers see the government's proposal as inflationary," D'Antoni said.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Bank of Italy cut the official discount rate to 6.75 percent from 7.50 percent after months of falling inflation.</p>
<p>"With the cut in interest rates, Federmeccanica's alibi on costs and inflation simply disappears," D'Antoni said.</p>
<p>The dispute, which involves some 1.7 million workers, is expected to set the tone for pay deals in a number of other Italian industrial sectors.</p>
<p>Metalworkers unions have already staged three one-day stoppages to press their claims, and leaders of Italy's main three union federations have threatened to call a general strike if management does not accept the government proposal.</p>
