<headline>CBOT rice ends firmer on higher cash ideas.</headline>

<p>CBOT rice futures closed firmer on Friday, boosted by reports of higher cash bids in the country, traders said.</p>
<p>"There's rumors that a commercial rice firm was bidding a decent size premium for cash rice, new crop and old crop," a floor trader said.</p>
<p>Cash markets had been quiet for several weeks but export business was picking up, as was evident in Thursday's USDA weekly export sales report, and the cash basis responded accordingly, traders said. USDA on Thursday put weekly sales at 37,600 tonnes, well above expectations for 15,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Costa Rica and Colombia were rumored to be in the market for U.S. rice. U.S. exporters said Colombia had purchased Argentine rice but may be seeking additional cargoes.</p>
<p>Dean Witter and local traders were said to be buyers of new crop rice while Cargill Investor Services sold the May, traders said.</p>
<p>Rice ended 11 to three cents per cwt higher with May up six at $11.68.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated by CBOT at 500 lots, against Thursday's actual volume of 350 lots.</p>
