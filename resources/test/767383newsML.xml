<p>The Australian share market headed higher at the open on Wednesday with banks leading the way after local interest rates were cut.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia reduced the official cash rate by 0.5 percentage points to 5.0 percent, citing good inflation and wages data and the scope for growth in output and employment.</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index climbed 8.20 points to 2,740.1.</p>
<p>"The much mooted interest rate cut has finally arrived," said Steve Mayne, dealer at brokerage Nevitts Ltd.</p>
<p>"The market has taken it in and the interest rate sensitive stocks have moved up on the back of it," he added, although he noted the rate cut was widely anticipated and largely priced in.</p>
<p>"It's been reasonably factored into the market anyway, and I would be surprised if the market got much firmer than it is at the moment," he said.</p>
<p>ANZ Bank led the way in the banks, climbing 1.5 percent to a record high A$10.75 (US$7.96). Westpac Banking Corporation also hit a new peak, up 1.5 percent to A$8.60, while Commonwealth Bank added over one percent to A$16.90. Sector leader National Australia bank lagged the rest, up just a cent to A$19.79, although traders noted it remained near the top of its recent record range.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the gold sector outperformed the market despite a drop in the bullion price, with speculation of a Barrick Gold Corp bid for Great Central Mines fuelling modest interest in the sector. Great Central shares were 4.4 percent higher at A$2.82.</p>
<p>Newcrest Mining added 2.5 percent to A$2.87, Lihir Gold climbed over two percent to A$1.92, while Resolute was up 3.8 percent at A$1.91. Most of the rest were mixed, with patchy volumes the order of the day so far.</p>
<p>Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about eight to three, while about 39 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>(A$1=US$0.74)</p>
