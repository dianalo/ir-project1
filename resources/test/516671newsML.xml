<p>People who drink two measures of alcohol a day, five days a week, have the lowest risk of heart attacks, Australian researchers reported on Friday.</p>
<p>They said their study proved that, to have health benefits, alcohol must be drunk regularly and in moderate amounts.</p>
<p>Patrick McElduff and Annette Dobson of the University of Newcastle in New South Wales took notice of a growing body of studies that show light to moderate drinkers have a lower risk of death from heart disease than heavy drinkers or non-drinkers.</p>
<p>But, they complained, the studies did not differentiate between people who had just a few drinks every day and those who had all their drinks in a weekend binge.</p>
<p>They wanted to know whether it made any difference if the 14 or so drinks a week for women and 21 drinks a week recommended for men were spread out over a week.</p>
<p>McElduff and Dobson studied more than 11,500 heart attack sufferers and 6,000 people who did not have heart attacks and found the risk of heart attack was lowest among people who drank two measures of alcohol a day.</p>
<p>A drink is usually defined as one glass (125 ml or 4 oz) of wine, one beer (500 ml or 8 oz) or 40 ml of spirits.</p>
<p>"Risk is lowest among men who report one to four drinks daily on five or six days a week and among women who report one or two drinks daily on five or six days a week," they wrote in a report in the British Medical Journal.</p>
<p>"There was an increased risk of a major coronary event for men and women who took one or more drinks a day rarely and for men who took more than 13 drinks a day on one or two days a week or every day."</p>
<p>Having a couple of drinks had a strong protective effect against heart attack in women for 24 hours, but not so strong an effect in men.</p>
<p>This could be because alcohol affects the fibrinolytic system, part of the process involved in blood clotting, they said. The effects only last 24 hours.</p>
<p>McElduff said they also had taken account of the possibility that non-drinkers in some of the studies did not drink because they had health problems.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, they said drinking alcohol should not be promoted as a health measure because of the bad effects of too much drinking.</p>
