<p>Shares in Singapore property company Wing Tai Holdings Ltd fell eight cents to a new year low of Singapore $3.82 on Monday.</p>
<p>At 0735 GMT, the shares were around S$3.84, with more than one million shares traded.</p>
<p>Dealers said Wing Tai shares were suffering from a general bearish market sentiment but the stock remains a buy, said ING Baring assistant director Lim Chung Chun.</p>
<p>"I believe Wing Tai will perform well relative to the Singapore property sector," Lim told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Lim said he expected Wing Tai to post good earnings for the next three to four years based on projects under way.</p>
<p>"The projects, like those in Hong Kong and Singapore's Bukit Timah, are on comfortable profit margins," Lim said.</p>
<p>He said its two projects along Bukit Timah, a prime residential area in central Singapore, could fetch 30-40 percent more than current market prices.</p>
<p>"So even if prices were to fall, Wing Tai can achieve decent profit margins," Lim said.  </p>
<p>Other analysts said they were cautious about calling a buy on the stock given Singapore's weaker property market after the government's April 12 move to curtail public housing subsidies.</p>
<p>"We can expect more bad news on the sector as the over-supply situation mounts," said another analyst.</p>
