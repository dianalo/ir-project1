<p>Mexican Finance Minister Guillmero Ortiz issued a warning to tax evaders on Monday and urged the public to view tax cheats as common thieves.</p>
<p>Ortiz said on a radio tax talk show that it was an affront to society that certain rich Mexicans did not pay taxes when less wealthy ones did. He urged Mexicans to "see tax evaders as people stealing from the rest of society," but stopped short of asking them to blow the whistle on tax evaders.</p>
<p>His strong message came shortly after Mexico launched a crackdown on tax evasion in response to a sharp drop in tax receipts after last year's economic crisis. Arrest warrants have been issued for several high-profile businessmen and the government has launched an aggressive media ad campaign featuring a burning match and the slogan "Don't Get Burned."</p>
<p>Tax evasion is widely seen as a sport in Mexico and people who do not pay are praised for "accounting" skills. Ortiz estimated that 70 percent of workers do not pay income tax, many from the "informal sector" who sell goods on the streets, polish shoes in bars and wash windshields at traffic lights.</p>
<p>Newspaper magnate Juan Francisco Ealy Ortiz was the most prominent businessman to be caught in the crackdown. Ealy, who owns Mexico City's oldest daily newspaper, El Universal, is free on bail pending charges of tax fraud. Arrest warrants are out for three other businessmen.</p>
<p>As part of the clampdown, Mexico plans to carry out 400,000 audits on companies and public servants this year, Finance Ministry spokesman Alejandro Valenzuela told reporters on Monday, hinting that the tax problem in Mexico is exacerbated by officials taking bribes not to investigate.</p>
<p>Finance minister Ortiz said Mexico's tax collection levels were too low. Discounting tax receipts on items such as fuel sales, he said, tax inflows were not even 10 percent of the country's gross domestic product (GDP).</p>
<p>But he gave no indication Mexico was about to change its tax rates: a 34 percent income tax and a 15 percent value added tax under which products are taxed according to value added at each level of production and exchange.</p>
<p>"Mexican tax rates are not high," he said.</p>
<p>The drive to capture tax cheats includes collecting information on people who buy luxury cars or take expensive flights. Tax officials are asking travel agents to supply names and addresses of clients who have traveled extensively.</p>
<p>Ortiz said the government was pinpointing offenders who, for example, paid a few dollars in taxes but flew first-class to Paris three times. "Such scenarios do not fit together."</p>
<p>Mexico's top business leader went one step further than Ortiz on Monday, calling for an overhaul of tax laws to give bosses more certainty about where they stand.</p>
<p>"We desperately need to look together to implement judicial certainty for companies, which would require a complete fiscal reform," Hector Larios Santillan, the chairman of the Business Coordinating Council, told reporters.</p>
