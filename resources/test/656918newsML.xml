<p>Italy said it had evacuated 80 foreigners from Congo's capital Brazzaville on Thursday on a military transport plane that took in Italian paratroopers to guard their country's embassy.</p>
<p>A Foreign Ministry statement said the operation, conducted in coordination with French forces on the ground, had flown out 50 Italians and 30 people of other nationalities.</p>
<p>The C-130 Hercules plane took on board a further 25 Italians and several other foreigners who had been evacuated from Congo during a stop-over in Gabon on its way to Rome, the statement said.</p>
<p>"Despite the risks arising from the tense situation on the ground, the entire Brazzaville operation was carried out without particular difficulty," it added.</p>
<p>Forces loyal to Congolese President Pascal Lissouba have been battling the Cobra militia of former Marxist military ruler Denis Sassou Nguesso.</p>
<p>Fighting continued to spread throughout Brazzaville on Thursday, ending a day-old ceasefire negotiated after a week of fierce clashes.</p>
