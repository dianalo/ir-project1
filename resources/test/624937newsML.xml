<p>A team of Thai veterinarians was racing against time on Thursday to save the lives of wild elephants believed to be dying after drinking poisoned water or being infected by a deadly virus in a southern province.</p>
<p>Officials said the team was hunting for the elephants after two of them, from a herd of about 100, were found dead near a watering hole in Kruiyaburi district of Prachuab Khirikhan province, about 270 km (164 miles) south of Bangkok.</p>
<p>The death of the two this week sparked an outcry from wildlife conservation groups who alleged that pineapple growers in the area may have poisoned the elephants to keep them from destroying their crops.</p>
<p>"The cause of death is still a mystery. But it is unlikely that they died from poisoned water as earlier suspected because fish were alive in the watering hole," Paiboon Chansilp, Kuiyaburi district chief, told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>"The veterinarians believe that the elephants might have been infected by some virus and died," he added.</p>
<p>Paiboon said after several days of trekking, the veterinarians found that a number of elephants were ill and urgently needed help.</p>
<p>"The fluid waste found along their trek shows that a number of them are suffering diarrhoea and urgently need medical treatment, otherswise they will soon die," he added.</p>
<p>The team initially spotted a herd of about 12 elephants near the watering hole but failed to subdue them with anaesthetising darts because of the rugged terrain.</p>
<p>The team was determined to save the elephants and would not let up on its mission, he said.</p>
<p>Elephant herds used to roam freely in the Kuiyaburi jungles but have now found themselves trapped in some jungle stretches as farmers clear tracts of land to grow pineapples.</p>
<p>Elephants are regarded as noble animals in Thailand, where they serves many purposes ranging from transportation for the king to participation in parades and moving logs in the jungles.</p>
<p>The Wildlife Foundation estimates that there about 500 wild elephants still living in jungles throughout the country, but they are threatened with extinction as villagers keep encroaching on their habitat.</p>
