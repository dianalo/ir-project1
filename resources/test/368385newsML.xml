<p>The Bank of Portugal was expected to leave key rates unchanged when it announces conditions for the next central bank reserve accounting period at 1415 gmt today, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The escudo remains under a little pressure and the January inflation numbers come out later this week. Inflation could turn out less favourable in the first months of this year. For these reasons I don't see any rate changes," said one operator.</p>
<p>Another said: "I believe that in the next few weeks the Bank of Portugal could give some signal through rates, if the escudo is not too volatile, but today it won't act."</p>
<p>Finance Minister Antonio Sousa Franco has said inflation could be higher in the first quarter 1997 than in the same period of 1996 because price rises were very low in early 1996.</p>
<p>But officials and analysts said they believed that the government's target for average annual inflation of between 2.25 and 2.50 percent by the end of 1997 was not at risk.</p>
