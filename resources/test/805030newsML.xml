<p>Hungarian overnight rates finished firmer, at 20.25 percent on Monday, up from Friday's close of 19.25 percent as the market started a new reserve period, dealers said.</p>
<p>Most deals were made at between 20 and 20.25 percent, althought there were some deals at 20.375 percent as well.</p>
<p>Trading was as usual at the beginning of a reserve period, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Everything was as usual, namely that at the beginning of reserve period we move back to a normal, higher level," said Pal Szucs of Hypo-Bank Hungaria.</p>
<p>Hungarian banks regard the National Bank of Hungary's one-week reverse repo rate, now at 20 percent, as benchmark.</p>
<p>Szucs said trading was balanced in good liquidity on the market.</p>
