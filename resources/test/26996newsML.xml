<p>Bulgaria's Supreme Court on Monday blocked the presidential candidacy of Socialist Georgi Pirinski on the grounds that he was born and spent his early childhood in the United States.</p>
<p>Pirinski, a reform-minded socialist and currently foreign minister, was born in New York in 1948 of a Bulgarian father and American mother. His family moved in the mid-1940s to Bulgaria where Pirinski made a career in the old ruling communist party.</p>
<p>But the Bulgarian Supreme Court upheld a ruling by the Central Electoral Commission (CEC) that Pirinski, who has a Bulgarian passport, be disqualified from the presidential race because he was not born in Bulgaria.</p>
<p>"The five judges unanimously ruled that Pirinski was not a Bulgarian citizen at the time of his birth," said the official.</p>
<p>The constitutional court ruled last month that the country's president must be a Bulgarian citizen by birth.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP), which filed Monday's appeal to the Supreme Court, consists largely of ex-communists. It has backed Pirinski, saying the court had not acted impartially in interpreting the constitution.</p>
<p>BSP officials had believed the father's nationality would be sufficient to determine Pirinski junior was also a Bulgarian.</p>
<p>"The BSP will hold an extraordinary plenum this week to decide on a new candidate," BSP high council member Valentin Vatzev told reporters. The BSP is expected to set a date of the plenum at a meeting due to end later on Monday.</p>
<p>Presidential elections are due on October 27 and candidates can submit papers and amendments to their applications in CEC until September 22.</p>
