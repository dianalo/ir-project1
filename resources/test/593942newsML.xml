<p>A group led by international financier George Soros said Monday it has begun negotiating with Indigo NV to buy additional convertible preferred shares and warrants in a transaction that could be valued at about $10 million.</p>
<p>In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the group, which holds the equivalent of 20.42 million shares, or a 30.35 percent stake, in the Dutch company, said the amount is undetermined but that the transaction would be done through a private placement.</p>
<p>Indigo is a Dutch corporation that researches, develops and produces electronic printing products. The Soros group in the SEC filing said the company has estimated that it would receive about $10 million from the pending transaction.</p>
<p>"The reporting persons may purchase a portion of the convertible preferred shares and warrants offered in the private placement," the Soros group said in the SEC filing.</p>
<p>In May of last year, the Soros group first reported holding a stake in Indigo. At that time, the group said it holds the securities for investment purposes. It did not indicate in the Monday filing a change in its intentions.</p>
