<p>Lands' End Inc said Thursday it soon will begin construction of a 145,000-square-foot warehouse and phone facility at its Dodgeville, Wis. headquarters.</p>
<p>"We need the space to allow more flexibility for the growth we expect to achieve in the years ahead," said president Michael Smith in a statement.</p>
<p>The company said the State of Wisconsin qualifies the Lands' End project for designation as an Enterprise Development Zone, which will make the company eligible for income tax credits and reimbursement of some training costs.</p>
<p>Lands' End said it could receive up to $3 million in tax credits by reaching its hiring goal of adding about 650 positions over the next four years.</p>
<p>The company said it also entered into a development agreement with the City of Dodgeville that will provide financial assistance for site improvements pending approval of the creation of a Tax Increment Financing District.</p>
<p>Lands' End sells casual clothing through specialty catalogs.</p>
