<p>Premiums for quality European white sugars are holding steady despite an apparent easing in demand and competition from other suppliers, physical traders said on Thursday.</p>
<p>After a flurry of buying activity during the past weeks from traditional users in the Middle East, demand has now slackened but supply is still not thought to be particularly tight.</p>
<p>Traders quoted nearby EU premiums at a steady $3-4 for sugar packed in polyjute bags, with a discount of roughly $2 for polypropylenes.</p>
<p>"There really is nothing in the market at all to justify it -- it's gone very dead. Fundamentally, the market should be weaker," said one physical trader.</p>
<p>"There's no demand and very little interest and any interest there is in the market is at pretty cheap prices," he added.</p>
<p>But it was also suggested that some holders of European sugars could be keeping a tight rein on supply in response to the weakening demand and also to ensure that premiums remained supported.</p>
<p>"On fundamental factors, I think most people have expected the pressure on the premium to be far stronger than it has. Maybe the European sugars aren't being pushed," said Chris Pack, analyst at Czarnikow Sugar.</p>
<p>"If the pressure is with the first hand still sitting on it, not being willing to put it into second hand where it just creates pressure -- to try and keep some control over it," he said.</p>
<p>Iran has been one of the biggest buyers of white sugar recently but the buying has dried up for the time being with the onset of a holiday period to celebrate the Iranian New Year.</p>
<p>Demand in Egypt, which wants to be self-sufficient in sugar by expanding production, is thought to be satisfied at the moment and the country recently asked suppliers to defer shipments of raw sugar.</p>
<p>But Syria tendered to buy white sugar this week and Libya also entered the market, with traders saying more than one cargo could be taken if prices were attractive.</p>
<p>Middle East demand has also been seen for lesser-quality sugars, thus opening up the region to alternative central American suppliers such as Mexico and Guatemala.</p>
<p>Traders noted inquiry from Yemen, which normally accepts sugars of qualities up to 100 ICUMSA.</p>
<p>But the first lesser-quality shipments from Brazil's new crop will probably not be available until at least late May and Thai cargoes are generally considered to be expensive, priced at some $20 over London futures.</p>
<p>Thai raws shipments continue to lag behind last year's levels as millers hold back supplies in the hope of better prices, while availability of whites is tight.</p>
<p>Mexico and Guatemala could theoretically satisfy the demand but cargoes are reported to be thin on the ground. Mexico has recently been a good supplier of bagged sugar to both west and east African end-users. "There are certainly more other origins waiting to take their (EU) markets," Pack said.</p>
<p>Market sources quoted prompt Mexican 100 ICUMSA sugars from the east coast at a $15 discount to May futures, with 45 ICUMSA cargoes quoted at $7 under.</p>
<p>Demand has been noted in the freight market to ship parcels of Sudanese sugar -- likely to be 100 ICUMSA -- into Aqaba, whereas traders said Japan normally features as a buyer of such cargoes.</p>
<p>Further afield, offtake in Pakistan has also eased while the country rids itself of a backlog of vessels waiting to discharge sugar.</p>
<p>But demand is then expected to pick up and Pakistan is said to have decided to import a further 50,000 tonnes to cover shortages this year, as production continues to lag behind last year's levels.</p>
