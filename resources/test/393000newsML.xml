<headline>Parliament inquiry seeks transit fraud crackdown.</headline>

<p>A committee of the European Parliament called on Wednesday for sweeping reforms of custom regulations vulnerable to fraud when goods are transported to one European Union country by way of another.</p>
<p>"The report was adopted by an overwhelming majority," Dutch Socialist Piet Dankert, told a news conference. The committee of inquiry's report will be presented on Thursday.</p>
<p>There is wide agreement that the EU transit system -- designed in the 1960s for six EU members-- has not kept up with changes such as the removal of EU internal border checks in 1993 and expansion of the system to non-EU European countries.</p>
<p>The EU system allows traders to pay customs duties, value-added tax and excise duties in the country of final destination, rather than at borders in between. But fraudulent operators offload goods on the market before arriving in the city where the taxes must be paid.</p>
<p>At least 750 million Ecus is lost annually in duties and levies on cigarettes, alcohol and other high value products as fraudsters took advantage of the EU's archaic paper-based system, Dankert said.</p>
<p>The inquiry's report calls for faster introduction of a computerised transit system and its extension from road to maritime transport, he said.</p>
<p>Modernisation of national customs services and increased cooperation were also essential, he added.</p>
<p>In addition, the EU should press Switzerland and Cyprus during negotiations on trade and EU membership, to tighten their transit rules.</p>
