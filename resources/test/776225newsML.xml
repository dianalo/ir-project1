<p>Ensearch Exploration Inc said Monday it expects to make a material downward revision of its oil and natural gas reserves, mostly in behind pipe and proved undeveloped reserves in East Texas and proved undeveloped reserves in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>These reserves are not ones that are currently producing, but that were intended for future development with additional investment, a company spokesman said.  </p>
<p>The company based its decision on a review of the commercial feasibility of its non-producing oil and gas properties.</p>
<p>"This evaluation indicated that inventory is not as large as we had originally expected," spokesman John MacDonald said.</p>
<p>The company said more analysis is required, but that it expects the amount of the downward revision of its proven non-producing reserves will fall within a range of 500 billion to 700 billion cubic feet equivalent.</p>
<p>The company said the revision should not affect its current cash flow and that the value impact should be offset to an extent by the elimination of capital costs associated with developing the reserves.</p>
<p>The company said a determination of the extent of the revision and its financial impact will be completed by the third quarter.</p>
