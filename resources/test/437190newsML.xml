<p>Anglo-French joint venture GEC Alsthom signed a memorandum of understanding with India's Usha (India) Ltd on Wednesday to examine the possibility of building a power plant.</p>
<p>Timothy Fisher, GEC Alsthom project development director, told Reuters he estimated a plant of this size would cost around $100 million to build.</p>
<p>The proposed 80 megawatt combined cycle gas turbine captive power plant would supply the Indian company's steel plant at Jagdishpur in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>Fisher said the feasibility study should be completed by September and his company would expect financial closure within another 12 months. The naphtha-fuelled plant would take two years to complete after financial closure.</p>
<p>GEC Alsthom is jointly owned by General Electric Co Plc and Alcatel Alsthom.</p>
