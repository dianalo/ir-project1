<p>-- FRANCE IN 3 BILLION STG BID TO AID CREDIT LYONNAIS</p>
<p>The French government is considering a plan to provide up to FFr30 billion (3.24 billion stg) in new aid to the troubled bank Credit Lyonnais. The plan, which is likely to be opposed by other large banks, would also need approval from the European Commission. The figure comes on top of the FFr49 billion which has already been provided for the bank, and is significantly larger than the FFr16 billion which has been circulating in recent weeks.</p>
<p>-- PARTNERSHIP LAW PLANNED TO DETER OFFSHORE EXODUS</p>
<p>Trade and industry secretary Ian Lang has announced proposals to introduce 'limited liability partnerships' (LLPs) in a bid to stop floods of professional firms - led by the accountants - from registering offshore in Jersey to limit their legal risks. Lang also revealed a series of strict new safeguards designed to protect clients, suppliers and creditors of the new 'partnerships'. The move to introduce LLPs comes after two of the 'big six' accountancy firms - Ernst &amp; Young and Price Waterhouse - threatened to register offshore as LLPs in Jersey.</p>
<p>-- COURT UPHOLDS LLOYD'S REINSURANCE RESCUE MOVE</p>
<p>The insurance market Lloyd's of London has won the first round of a High Court legal action against a number of Names who refused to accept the terms of its recovery plan. The judgement against the Names - individuals whose assets have traditionally backed Lloyd's - confirms the authority of Lloyd's to reinsure billions of pounds in losses into a new company called Equitas. Over 90 per cent of 34,000 Names have accepted the recovery plan along with compensation for their losses.</p>
<p>-- US LEAVES DOOR AJAR IN ROW WITH EU OVER CUBA TRADE</p>
<p>The US has decided not to oppose the setting up of a World Trade Organisation panel to rule on the dispute with the EU over its Helms-Burton anti Cuba law. Under the law, US companies are authorised to take legal action against foreign companies 'trafficking' in assets seized in Cuba by the Castro regime. The US move not to oppose the formation of the WTO panel leaves open the possibility of a settlement with the EU on the issue.</p>
<p>-- CROSS-BORDER CRIME LOSES EU BILLIONS</p>
<p>A European Parliament inquiry into smuggling within the European Union following the removal of border controls has claimed that international criminals are using the changes to avoid paying customs duties worth billions of ecus. The report on 'transit fraud', which will be debated by parliament next month, estimates that smuggling - principally of cigarettes - costs the EU at least Ecu4.5 billion (3.2 billion stg).</p>
<p>-- STRONG POUND STIFLING GROWTH, CBI WARNS</p>
<p>Employers' organisation the Confederation of British Industry has warned that the strength of sterling is stifling UK exports and economic growth. In its monthly trends survey of 1,300 manufacturing companies, the CBI said that overseas sales were being held down by the high pound, and cut its prediction for growth in gross domestic product in 1997 from 3.1 per cent to 2.8 per cent. However, the CBI is still forecasting an interest rate rise later this year.</p>
<p>-- BRANSON MAY JOIN OLD FRIEND IN FILM BID MOVE</p>
<p>Richard Branson's Virgin group is considering an alliance with British-based film company Scala Films to bid for a National Lottery-funded film franchise. The venture would reunite Branson with childhood friend Nik Powell, a former colleague at Virgin and now co-chair of Scala. The consortium being assembled by Powell will compete for one of four film franchises which will receive up to 39 million stg of lottery money from the Arts Council over six years.</p>
<p>-- SHARES IN GKN RISE AS US JUDGE HINTS AT CUT IN DAMAGES</p>
<p>Shares in UK engineering group GKN rose 22p to 935.5p on Thursday following indications from a US judge that he might cut up to 30 per cent off a multi-million dollar damages award against the company. A jury in North Carolina had awarded punitive damages of $150 million (92.5 million stg) against GKN after it was convicted in December of defrauding 2,500 franchisees of its specialist US exhaust retailer Meineke Discount Mufflers.</p>
<p>-- VERITY SEEKS 8.65 MILLION STG FOR SPEAKER DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p>UK hi-fi group Verity has reported interim pre-tax losses of 1.4 million stg, compared to profits of 971,000 stg last time. The company has said it is to raise 8.65 million stg from a share issue to fund development of its NXT flat-panel loudspeakers. The move follows a licensing deal with Japanese company NEC for the new technology, with NEC planning to use the new speakers in laptop computers.</p>
<p>-- HEART MURMURS PROMPT SHIELD ANNOUNCEMENT</p>
<p>Healthcare company Shield Diagnostics is expected Friday to issue a statement clarifying the progress of the loss-making company's research. Shares in the group have tripled over the past month amid speculation that Shield is close to discovering a test for heart disease. On Thursday, the shares rose 40p to 416.5p following the announcement of a research agreement with US pharmaceuticals company Abbott Laboratories.
