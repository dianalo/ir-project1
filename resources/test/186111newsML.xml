<p>The government is expected to unveil a $900 million trade gap for October, the 15th deficit in 28 months of Real economic stabilization plan, a financial newspaper said.</p>
<p>This outlook, which would bring the trade gap for the first 10 months of 1996 to $2.5 billion, stirred the financial markets, Gazeta Mercantil said.</p>
<p>Gazeta said the Finance Ministry was not anticipating a change in the trade balance's trend until mid-1997 when measures designed to stimulate exports should take effect.</p>
<p>Last week, the government revealed disappointing exports of $4.188 billion in October, up from $4.115 billion in September but down from October 1995's $4.405 billion.</p>
