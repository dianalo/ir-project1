<p>Russia's Aeroflot airline Tuesday signed a $1.5 billion deal to buy 20 Russian jets equipped with American engines and electronics, a move officials hope will help revive the faltering domestic aviation sector.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the Voronezh Jet Construction company will build the IL-96 M/T planes and equip them with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines and electronics made by Rockwell Avionics.</p>
<p>The new jets are part of an expansion by Aeroflot, which inherited the foreign routes of the once Soviet airline and is now seeking to modernise its ageing fleet.</p>
<p>Aeroflot already operates several Western jets, and has announced plans to purchase 10 Boeing jets.</p>
<p>"The IL-96-300s we fly today have proved not bad, but we need even better quality," said Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, Aeroflot's general director.</p>
<p>"The new technology is represented by the IL-96 M/T. I'm a patriot, but I'm also fighting for quality, reliability, regularity and safety, which prompted me to sign this contract," Shaposhnikov said.</p>
<p>The Russian aviation industry has complained that Aeroflot's growing use of Western aircraft is crippling domestic aircraft production. Aeroflot officials said aiding domestic production was also a factor in signing the deal.</p>
<p>Shaposhnikov, who was the last defence minister of the Soviet Union, said Aerosflot's main long-distance jet will be the IL-96, short flights will be on Boeing 737s.</p>
<p>Alexei Bochkarev, programme manager for Rockwell's Russian operations, said the contract for adapting American aviation electronics for Russian planes was worth roughly $50 million.</p>
<p>Officials said the American components in the new planes -- the engines and aviation electronics -- are worth a little more than half of the plane's entire cost.</p>
<p>Aeroflot expects to start flying the new plane in the second half of 1997, pending certification.</p>
