<p>U.N. peacekeepers in Cyprus protested to Turkish forces on Monday after the "deplorable" killing of a 58-year-old Greek Cypriot civilian who had crossed into the north of the divided island.</p>
<p>The sharp words from the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) followed the killing of Petros Kakouli on Sunday on the edge of the self-proclaimed Turkish Cypriot state. It raised to five -- four Greek Cypriots and one Turkish Cypriot -- the number of people killed along the buffer zone since June.</p>
<p>"UNFICYP is deeply concerned that once again an innocent life was lost as the result of the deplorable and unnecessary use of lethal force," the force said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The force commander of UNFICYP has, in the strongest possible terms, requested the commander of the Turkish forces in Cyprus that he instruct the soldiers under his command not to shoot unless their own lives are threatened."</p>
<p>Turkey has 30,000 troops in the north of the island, where the Turkish Cypriots live.</p>
<p>Sir David Hannay, Britain's special representative on the Cyprus problem, added his condemnation of the killing of the retired fireman after a 90-minute meeting with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides.</p>
<p>"Anything that can be done to make incidents like that less likely to happen would be thoroughly worthwhile," said Hannay, who arrived on Sunday night to continue efforts to end the 22-year-old division of the island.</p>
<p>Cypriot government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides called the killing "utterly unwarranted, premeditated, carried out in cold blood."</p>
<p>Kakouli's body, which had been left where he fell for about four hours, was returned to the Greek Cypriot side on Monday. Relatives said he had been shot three times.</p>
<p>A post mortem revealed the fatal shot hit Kakouli in the chest. "I cannot say whether they were fired at close distance," pathologist Petros Vanezis told journalists. "The range is difficult to say. There is no gunshot wound directly on the skin," he said.</p>
<p>Another post mortem carried out by Turkish Cypriot doctors earlier found Kakouli had died of a single gunshot wound which punctured his lung and heart.</p>
<p>Turkish Cypriot officials said the man had gone 200 metres (yards) into the self-proclaimed Turkish Cypriot state, ignored three warnings to stop and was shot while trying to escape.</p>
<p>Turkey's semi-official Anatolian news agency reported Turkish Cypriot police said he had a knife and a piece of rope concealed in his boots.</p>
<p>The shooting happened near the eastern end of the buffer zone, close to Achna village and territory controlled by British military bases.</p>
<p>Cypriot police said Kakouli was shot when standing with his hands up: "Turkish soldiers shot him once and then walked closer to him and finished him off."</p>
<p>Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash expressed regret for the shooting but blamed Greek Cypriot intransigence for tension on the island.</p>
<p>"For both Turks and Greeks, this death is a bitter event. The way to remove the reasons that caused these events lies with the negotiating table," the Turkish Cypriot news agency TAK quoted Denktash as saying.</p>
<p>Cyprus has been divided since Turkey invaded in 1974 after a Greek-engineered coup on the island. A Turkish Cypriot breakaway state in the north, recognised only by Ankara, was established in 1983.</p>
