<title>GERMANY: Nervous German share market eyes skittish U.S.</title>
<headline>Nervous German share market eyes skittish U.S.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-01-29</dateline>

<p>The German share market, shocked at Wall Street's volatility and the see-saw response by German Bunds to key U.S. data Wednesday, is unlikely to find any clear direction this week, dealers predicted.</p>
<p>"Frankly, I don't quite know what to make of it all and nor does anyone else," said a Frankfurt dealer, referring to an inconclusive reaction on global markets to apparently softer-than-expected U.S. durable goods orders data.</p>
<p>"Those looked like encouraging numbers but we still saw Bunds shoot up and plunge back down. It's only natural that investors will be extremely cautious this week."  </p>
<p>The 30-share IBIS DAX was down 35.98 points at 2,992.29 points at 1449 GMT, some seven points below the DAX's floor closing level, having shot briefly upward after the U.S. data was released only to almost immediately resume its decline.</p>
<p>March DTB DAX futures were down 39.5 points at 3,003.5.</p>
<p>Even a firm opening on Wall Street would fail to convince investors to come into the German market, dealers predicted.</p>
<p>"We thought we were safe yesterday; the Dow was up 100, and then look what happened," said a Munich dealer. The Dow, which was slightly higher Wednesday, had ended lower Tuesday after an early surge which carried German shares with it.  </p>
<p>The weaker dollar was dragging somewhat on the market, having supported selected blue chip stocks earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Chemical firms BASF AG and Bayer AG were both in decline after gaining earlier as they caught up with the recent vogue for export-driven shares. BASF was down 50 pfennigs at 59.60 marks and Bayer was down eight pfennigs at 62.25 marks.</p>
<p>Bank stocks remained the big losers, with Deutsche Bank AG down 2.10 marks at 82.55 marks. Dealers have been taking profits on bank shares, which had risen sharply recently.</p>
<p>Commerzbank was down 98 pfennigs at 41.89 marks.  </p>
<p>SAP AG fell four percent to 221.50 marks on worries its 1996 earnings report on Friday will be disappointing.</p>
<p>But most of the trading activity was between dealers themselves, with traders bemoaning the lack of customer orders.</p>
<p>With more key U.S. data due this week -- including weekly jobless claims and GDP -- that was seen as unlikely to change.</p>
<p>Many dealer said they still believed the market was generally headed for a minor correction, with estimates of the end point of that move ranging from 2,900 DAX points to as high as 2,950 points.</p>
