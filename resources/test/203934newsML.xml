<p>Chemicals company Courtaulds Plc said on Wednesday that profits declined at the halfway stage following a poor performance from its acrylics and viscose operations, but it was guardedly optimistic on the second half.</p>
<p>First half pretax profits at Courtaulds fell to 64 million pounds ($107.6 million) from 67.8 million previously.</p>
<p>This was at the low end of analysts' expectations and by 1430 GMT shares in the company were down 4-1/5 pence at 419-1/2 pence, despite a higher dividend of 4.45 pence a share, up from 4.3 pence last time.</p>
<p>Courtaulds said that there was underlying growth in all its key markets and that the group was better positioned now than has been the case for some time. It added that profits in its core businesses had improved in the first half.</p>
<p>"You can assume the momentum of the first half (will continue), with two areas of uncertainty, viscose and a little concern about the strength of sterling," Gordon Campbell, chief executive of Courtaulds said.</p>
<p>Last year the company was hit by a sharp fall in profitability in viscose, acrylic and acetate fibres because of high raw material costs, destocking and depressed consumer spending across Europe.</p>
<p>While acrylics started a recovery late this summer, margins in viscose have remained inadequate despite signs of improvement in its orders, said Courtaulds.</p>
<p>"In the last month or so we have seen an improvement in the order book but prices in viscose and hence the margins are still lousy," he said.</p>
<p>The strength of the pound, which recently hit four-year highs versus the dollar and a 30-month peak against the mark, is an area of mild concern for the international company.</p>
<p>"If the strength of sterling to the dollar continues then it is going to make margins tougher," said Campbell.</p>
<p>One of the brighter spots for the company was the performance of Tencel fibre, a man-made material derived from wood-pulp, which admirers say offers considerable advantages over viscose and cotton.</p>
<p>Courtaulds plans its third Tencel plant to be located in Grimsby in northern England and it is on schedule for commissioning towards the end of 1997.</p>
<p>Campbell said the company also plans to start manufacturing Tencel in Asia, which is one of the main driving areas of the textiles industry, and reckons that should be onstream before the year 2000.</p>
<p>"We expect to make a decision in the next few months as to where it is going to be," said Campbell.</p>
<p>In polymer products, continuing operations posted profit growth of 20 percent, while coatings and sealings were boosted by a strong performance in the Far East where several new products moved to fully commercial production.</p>
<p>Some analysts have suggested that a deterioration in Courtaulds' cash performance and the potential for increased demand for Tencel might prompt the firm to make a rights issue.</p>
<p>Campbell, however, dismissed the idea, "We have no plans for a rights issue, we beleive that we can fund our organic growth from our own resources."</p>
