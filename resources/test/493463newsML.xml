<p>Conoco International Petroleum Company said on Tuesday that Russia's high taxes and slow progress in passing energy laws were hampering existing and planned oil development projects in Russia.</p>
<p>Ken Watts, president of Conoco International, a unit of E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co, told an energy conference that Moscow had raised taxes and tariffs many times since Conoco's prominent Polar Lights venture began producing in 1994.</p>
<p>"This has all siphoned off significant value, reducing ours to a break-even level," he said. "The investors are the last to be paid -- they get the all-too-meagre remains."</p>
<p>Still, output at Polar Lights -- the first Russian-U.S. joint venture to tap a major, new Russian oil field -- rose over 50 percent in 1996 to 37,500 barrels per day (bpd) from around 24,000 bpd the previous year, Watts said.</p>
<p>The increase was possible because Polar Lights received more export pipeline space than expected.</p>
<p>Conoco is looking to exploit satellite fields because Ardalin had performed better than expected, he said. The company was also eyeing further development in a second production area north of Ardalin, the Yuzhno Khilchuyu field, in which Conoco had invested $90 million so far.</p>
<p>But Watts said Russia still needed to approve a long-delayed list of oil reserves open to production-sharing deals.</p>
<p>"The industry is still awaiting the green light to proceed," he said, adding that the soonest Yuzhno Khilchuyu could come on stream, if the list were approved this year, was 2002. It would produce 175,000 bpd.</p>
<p>Joint ventures are up in arms over the rising costs of producing oil in Russia.</p>
<p>Watts said there were now 20 taxes costing $2.65 per barrel of produced oil, more than double the five taxes totalling $1.25 per barrel in place in 1992. Similarly, transportation costs had risen to $3.80 per barrel in 1997 from $2.60 in 1992.</p>
<p>Polar Lights is a 50-50 venture between Conoco and Russia's Arkhangelskgeologiya.</p>
