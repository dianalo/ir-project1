<p>Pakistani President Farooq Leghari's decision to sack Benazir Bhutto's government will bolster investor confidence and could give a short-term boost to the stock market, brokers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The investors had a perception about Benazir that she was anti-business," Kalim Aziz, research head at Baring Securities, told Reuters. "True or not, they will initially react positively."</p>
<p>Aziz predicted the Karachi bourse, where shares jumped 2.80 percent on Monday, would extend its gains when it reopened on Wednesday. The bourse was closed on Tuesday due to a religious holiday.</p>
<p>He cited an expectation that the political and economic climate would clear with Bhutto's dismissal. Leghari accused Bhutto's government of corruption and nepotism.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Karachi Stock Exchange (KSE) 100-share index rose 40.81 points to end at 1,499.97. Shares soared amid blue chip buying powered by a rise in synthetic fibre prices and some favourable corporate results.</p>
<p>A European diplomat said international reaction was likely to be muted.</p>
<p>"For Western governments, the attitude will probably be that any change of government that happens constitutionally and peacefully is not really their business," he said.</p>
<p>An International Monetary Fund official said a visiting IMF team would pursue talks with the new government on reactivating a $600 million standby loan.</p>
<p>The military, which has ruled Pakistan for 24 of the 49 years since independence, has kept a low profile. But political observers said Leghari could not have acted without securing the approval and cooperation of the generals.</p>
<p>Mohammad Yaseen, treasury head at ANB Amro Bank, said an end to tension between Bhutto and Leghari could lift a cloud of uncertainty from the bourse.</p>
<p>"If the caretakers can initiate a fair accountability process, it could really help to restore investor confidence in the country in the long run," Yaseen said.</p>
<p>Dealer Ali Asghar of Fortune Securities said most investors blamed Bhutto for mismanagement of the economy and held her responsible for the political chaos.</p>
<p>"The market will take the news as positive, as for them the political and economic mess was of the making of Benazir Bhutto," Asghar said.</p>
<p>But Aziz said the market could fall off amid uncertainty ahead of the general elections, which have been called for February 3.</p>
<p>"The market will act nervously if it does not become clear who stands the chance to win the next elections," he said.</p>
