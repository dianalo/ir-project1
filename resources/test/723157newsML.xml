<p>Shares in National Westminster Bank Plc rose in a mixed bank sector on Friday as buyers returned following recent weakness in the stock.</p>
<p>With the stock underpinned by continuing vague bid hopes, NatWest shares were up 13-1/2p or 1.6 percent at 863p by 1001 GMT in moderate volume of 2.2 million shares.</p>
<p>"It's a very volatile stock at the best of times," said one dealer. "Bid rumours keep popping up from time to time...when the rumours quieten down as has happened recently the stock drifts off and they get to a level where buyers think they should get back in again."</p>
<p>By contrast Barclays Plc was down 11-1/2p at 12.12-1/2 stg and Lloyds TSB Group Plc was unchanged at 664p.</p>
<p>NatWest shares have lost 43-1/2p in the past three sessions from their record close of 889p set on July 3. The stock has been propelled higher in recent weeks by speculation that if might be subject to a bid or may sell its investment banking arm.</p>
