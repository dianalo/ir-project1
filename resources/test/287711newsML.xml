<p>Tens of thousands of Afghans prayed for rain on Sunday at the request of Mullah Mohammed Omar, the leader of the purist Islamic Taleban.</p>
<p>At the Eid Gah mosque, one of four sites in the capital Kabul used for Mullah Omar's request, between 5,000 and 6,000 people gathered in the open to pray.</p>
<p>"Seeing all the Moslems here, may God give us rain and a prosperous spring," said one of the preachers.</p>
<p>Worshippers were frisked as they entered the grounds of the mosque, which lies in the war-shattered ruins of Kabul's old city.</p>
<p>A truck-mounted anti-aircraft gun stood at the gates of the mosque and many heavily armed Taleban fighters were posted on vantage points to deter sabotage.</p>
<p>The Taleban, which captured Kabul in late September from the ousted government of president Burhanuddin Rabbani, has enforced a strict Islamic code in the more than two-thirds of the country under its control.</p>
<p>According to Maulawi Enayatullah Baligh, a Taleban official in Kabul, there is a tradition in Islam of praying to avert disaster that dates back to the time of the Prophet Mohammad.</p>
<p>"It is something we have inherited from the time of the Prophet Mohammad, peace be upon him, who used to pray outside to avert famine," said Baligh recently.</p>
<p>Afghanistan is a land of mountains and deserts and is dependent on annual rains. Many of the country's irrigation systems have been destroyed in 17 years of war.</p>
<p>"The war has inflicted huge losses on agriculture; the production of irrigable and dry lands has decreased by 33 and 50 percent respectively," according to a recent report by the International Committee of the Red Cross.</p>
<p>There have been only two light falls of snow this winter, leading to worries that there will not be enough irrigation water come the thaw in spring.</p>
<p>There are other fears as well.</p>
<p>Recent fighting between the Taleban and forces loyal to the ousted government and its allies has severely disrupted the fertile agricultural region north of Kabul.</p>
<p>The populations of villages which were once major suppliers of food to the people of Kabul have been forced to abandon their lands and flee to safety.</p>
<p>Rampant inflation -- 243 per cent in 1996 -- has pushed the price of imported food beyond the means of many of Kabul's inhabitants and the the United Nations estimates that almost half of the city's population receive food aid.</p>
