<p>British drug giant Glaxo Wellcome Plc on Thursday became the latest casualty of the strong pound, which dented first-half profits and sales.</p>
<p>But the world's second-biggest maker of prescription drugs said its strategy to manage the decline of top-selling anti-ulcerant Zantac was firmly on course, with sales of a package of new products including asthma treatment Serevent jumping by 50 percent.</p>
<p>Pre-tax profit fell by 2.2 percent to 1.517 billion pounds, while sales slipped 1.9 percent to 4.109 billion stg, bang in the middle of analysts' expectations. The dividend was left at 15.0 pence per share as Glaxo shifts towards its goal of reducing the interim payout to one-third of the total.</p>
<p>Chairman and chief executive Sir Richard Sykes told Reuters that sterling's rise had cut profits and sales by around 10 percent in the first half of the year, with the pound up by around 7 percent against the dollar and 20 percent against European currencies.</p>
<p>However he said the full-year impact should be around eight percent as the year-on-year comparisons become less pronounced.</p>
<p>Shares in the group, which have risen by 40 percent since the start of the year, fell back in midmorning trading as analysts returned from meeting the company, losing 38 pence to 1291 1/2.</p>
<p>"The stock is on a pretty ritzy rating," said one dealer. "The company is managing the retreat from Zantac very well...but the stock has had a good run and there's just an element of caution there</p>
<p>Stripping out the moves in exchange rates, Glaxo said underlying sales were up by eight percent. Ignoring Zantac, sales were ahead by 14 percent, putting it up with best-performing U.S. rivals like American Home Products Corp and Bristol Myers Squibb Co.</p>
<p>"Glaxo is set to become one of the strongest drug companies in the world by 1999. The key is message is that sales ex-Zantac were up a stunning 14 percent," said BZW analyst Steve Plag.</p>
<p>Sykes told Reuters "the new products are powering ahead and driving the growth, and that is what we always said. Zantac is disappearing from view."</p>
<p>Sales of Zantac fell 20 percent to 807 million pounds, reflecting generic competition in markets including Britain and Germany and the continued advance of rival products like Astra AB's Losec.</p>
<p>Although competition in the U.S, where its patent expired last week, has been delayed by squabbles among generic producers, Sykes said he still expected copycat versions to wipe out up to 90 percent of Glaxo's U.S. sales, which totalled around 400 million pounds in the first half.</p>
<p>Respiratory drugs, which include Serevent, Becotide and Flixotide, overtook Zantac for the first time to become the biggest-selling category, with sales up an underlying 7 percent to 891 million pounds. Other star performers included AIDS treatment Epivir and migraine drug Imigran.</p>
<p>Glaxo announced that diabetes drug Romozin, which some believe has the potential to be a blockbuster, won its first European marketing approval in Britain on Thursday. The company also hopes a new and more powerful anti-biotic Raxar, and an anti-smoking tablet, Zyban, will continue to power the growth of newer drugs in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>"That is the secret of this business, to increase new product innovation," Sykes said.</p>
