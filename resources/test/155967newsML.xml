<p>Benfica skipper Joao Vieira Pinto headed a last-minute goal against 10-man Lokomotiv Moscow to earn his side a 3-2 win in the second leg of their European Cup Winners' Cup second round match on Thursday.</p>
<p>They won 4-2 on aggregate.</p>
<p>Lokomotiv Moscow led twice on the night but the dismissal of Sergei Gurenko on the half hour for his second bookable offence, a tackle from behind, proved too much of a handicap.</p>
<p>They went ahead in the ninth minute when Andrei Solomatin picked up a through ball on the edge of the penalty area, evaded a sliding tackle and scored from a tight angle.</p>
<p>The Russians had the ball in the net again early in the second half but the effort was ruled offside. Within seconds Romanian Nicu Panduru had equalised from the edge of the penalty area.</p>
<p>Oleg Garas gave Lokomotiv the lead after 58 minutes following a brilliant solo run into the penalty area but Candido equalised within five minutes.</p>
