<headline>BASKETBALL-SWOOPES PLAYS FIVE MINUTES IN RETURN.</headline>
<dateline>HOUSTON, Texas 1997-08-07</dateline>

<p>After waiting out a year and a pregnancy to make her WNBA debut, five minutes with no shot attempts and no rebounds was enough for Sheryl Swoopes.</p>
<p>Swoopes, the Houston Comets forward who missed the team's first 19 games, made her first appearance of the season in Thursday's 74-70 victory over the Phoenix Mercury, just over six weeks after giving birth.</p>
<p>The 6-foot (1.83 metres) Swoopes was one of the stars of the 1996 U.S. Olympic gold medal team, but that was the last time she played a game. She gave birth to a baby boy, Jordan Eric Jackson, on June 25 and joined the team for practice for the first time on July 30.</p>
<p>"I feel really good," said the 26-year-old Swoopes, "nervous at first after not playing organised basketball for over a year. I knew it would take a little time to warm up and get the butterflies out. It doesn't matter how many minutes I play, it just felt good to be a part of the team tonight."</p>
<p>She had set Saturday's game against Los Angeles as the target date for her return, but decided to play this game to prepare for that contest, a nationally televised game.</p>
<p>Swoopes -- a Brownfield, Texas, native who led Texas Tech to the 1993 national collegiate championship, scoring a finals-record 47 points -- was one of the first two players to sign with the WNBA.</p>
