<p>DOWNER DEFENDS ASIAN HUMAN RIGHTS EFFORTS</p>
<p>Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, has defended the efforts of Asian nations to improve their human rights.</p>
<p>He told a political institute in Bonn differences between Asian and European values were overstated.</p>
<p>Mr Downer says many Asian countries are parties to United Nations instruments on human rights and are very committed to improvements in human rights.</p>
<p>He says while Indonesia is frequently criticised for its human rights record, it has set up its own Human Rights Commission.</p>

<p>IR REFORMS WILL APPEASE ASIA - REITH</p>
<p>Industrial Relations Minister Peter Reith says anxiety in Asia over Australia's industrial unrest will be solved once the Workplace Relations Bill is passed.</p>
<p>Companies in Japan and South-East Asia are reportedly becoming increasingly anxious over industrial disputes under the Coalition Government.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will today reassure business leaders in Tokyo that his Government's micro economic reforms will help.</p>
<p>Mr Reith says current industrial disputes are a small flurry before a lull that'll occur when his industrial legislation is in place.</p>
<p>But he says the disputes do make the reforms more urgent.</p>

<p>FISCHER IN DEBATE WITH DALAI LAMA</p>
<p>Deputy prime minister Tim Fischer and the Dalai Lama are having words over whether the Chinese occupation of Tibet has helped the Tibetan people.</p>
<p>Mr Fischer said the Chinese occupation had led to improved social conditions in Tibet.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama has responded suggesting Mr Fisher make another trip to Tibet, which he visited in 1993, and this time without Chinese interpreters.</p>
<p>But Mr Fischer says on his last trip to Tibet, he became quite adroit at getting away from his official minders.</p>
<p>He says while there are legitimate human rights issues which are of concern, he has seen some of the modernisatation which is taking place.</p>

<p>BORBIDGE CALLS ON CJC TO PROBE CORRUPTION ALLEGATIONS</p>
<p>The Queensland Premier Rob Borbidge has called on the Criminal Justice Commission, to urgently launch a public inquiry into alleged Police corruption.</p>
<p>Mr Borbidge said CJC Chairman Frank Clair's comments to a Parliamentary Estimates Committee, implicating police in the drug trade, reflect adversely on every serving officer in the Queenslnad Police Service.</p>
<p>An Associate Professor in politics at Griffith University Doctor John Wanna told ABC Radio the Premier's announcement appeared to be a direct result of the row between the State Government and the CJC that's developed over the past week.</p>
<p>He says the Premier is telling the CJC chairman to put up or shut up.</p>

<p>NEW SENATOR SWORN IN</p>
<p>New South Wales Liberal Party President, Bill Heffernan, has been sworn in as the State's newest Senator.</p>

<p>ALSTON BACKS REJECTION OF HARRADINE'S TELSTRA IDEA</p>
<p>Communications Minister Richard Alston has backed the Treasurer's criticim of Independent Senator Brian Harradine's proposed alternative to the part sale of Telstra.</p>
<p>Treasurer Peter Costello yesterday described as unattractive Senator Harradine's plan to issue redeemable preference shares in Telstra, instead of selling a third of the carrier.</p>
<p>Senator Alston says all ministers agree on the issue and the Government is not attracted to proposals that would increase public debt.</p>
<p>He says he's still considering Senator Harradine's other suggestions and will talk with him before the Telstra bill is debated in the Senate.</p>

<p>COUPLE FINED FOR SHOUTING ABUSE AT GAY MAN</p>
<p>A couple has been ordered to pay a gay man 50-thousand dollars for shouting abuse at him at the Sydney flats where they were neighbours.</p>
<p>The Equal Opportunity Tribunal has awarded the compensation in the first decision in New South Wales under the Anti-Discrimination Act.</p>
<p>The man told the Tribunal the couple who lived in the unit above him began repeatedly shouting abuse from their balcony when he moved in, in late 1993.</p>
<p>Outside the Tribunal, one of the defendants said he wouldn't be able to pay his half share of the compensation.</p>
<p>The Tribunal also ordered an apology be posted at the Housing Commission flats, in Surrey Hills.</p>

<p>WA CONDONES VIOLENCE AGAINST GAYS: ACTIVIST</p>
<p>A representative of gay people in Western Australia says the problem of youth suicide will be exacerbated because the State Government has refused to outlaw discrimination on the basis of sexuality.</p>
<p>Coalition MPs voted against changes to the State's Equal Opportunity laws to end discrimination against gays in employment, housing and the provision of goods and services.</p>
<p>Brian Greig of the Gay and Lesbian Equality group says the government is condoning violence against gays, and the decision contravenes the Commonwealth's Youth Suicide prevention Strategy.</p>
<p>He says Federal anti-discrimination laws are needed to protect gay and lesbian people.</p>
