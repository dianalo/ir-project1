<p>Malaysian rubber prices ended the week lower on technical adjustment and losses in Tokyo, but dealers expect a rebound next week on expectation of thin supply and fresh demand.</p>
<p>"Prices were easing because of technical correction and falls in Tokyo," a dealer at a trading firm said, adding that lack of strong demand also limited activity.</p>
<p>But dealers expect demand to pick next week as European dealers return from summer holidays.  </p>
<p>"Factories are resuming their operations and they need the raw materials, so they have to start buying now for forward shipment," another dealer said.</p>
<p>Tight supplies, because of the wet weather, also cautioned producers from selling in large volume, dealers said.</p>
<p>At the close, the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing Board set market indicator price for October RSS1 buyer at 329 cents ($1.32) a kg and October SMR 20 buyer at 315.50 cents.</p>
