<p>The German government's move to Berlin from Bonn will cost 288 million marks ($173 million) less than planned, Construction Minister Klaus Toepfer said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Speaking in Berlin, Toepfer said the total cost of the move should not exceed 20 billion marks. He said nearly 300 million marks would be saved from the renovations budget although costs for new buildings would rise by about 100 million marks.</p>
<p>Die-hard critics of the move have long pointed to the costs as a reason to keep the government and parliament in Bonn, but Toepfer has silenced their fears by keeping costs down.</p>
<p>He said one uncertain cost factor was the asbestos-ridden former East German parliament building, the Palast der Republik. He said a decision on whether to tear it down or remove the asbestos was set aside until 1999.</p>
<p>On Monday parliamentary speaker Rita Suessmuth broke the ground for a new office complex for members of parliament near the Reichstag and earlier this month Chancellor Helmut Kohl held a similar ceremony for Berlin's new chancellery.</p>
<p>These events marked a symbolic point of no return for the government's move from the former western capital of Bonn.</p>
<p>Parliament voted narrowly in 1991 to move to Berlin following the reunification of West and East Germany the year before.</p>
