<p>LIFFE cocoa futures extended aan advance in light volume to close firmer on Monday.</p>
<p>July added five stg to 1,016 stg per tonne and September rose six to 1,033. Back-month gains were larger, posting increases of between seven and nine. But activity was extremely thin with only 2,308 contracts changing hands.</p>
<p>About 50 May/December switches traded at 32 stg and manufacturers bought far forward months to help lift back months more than nearbys, traders said.</p>
<p>July rose above last week's high to etch out a fresh two-week high, but some traders were sceptical cocoa could sustain the gains since most of the jump was made amid low volume.</p>
<p>Some said origin sales expected in the 1,020-area and above could also limit further rises.</p>
<p>But others expected July to keep edging up to test the upper end of its trading range near the April 2 high of 1,065.</p>
<p>Prices showed little reaction to Merrill Lynch's forecast for a smaller-than-expected cocoa deficit this year due to improved Ivorian crop prospects and slower-than-expected demand growth.</p>
<p>Merrill said the 1996/97 cocoa deficit should come in near 50,000 tonnes and that cocoa was still overvalued.</p>
<p>It said April rains "vastly" improved mid-crop expectations, with some suggesting that output might even be better than last season. The total Ivorian crop might not be much less than last season's bumper harvest of 1.2 million tonnes, and bean sizes were bigger than last season, it said.</p>
<p>Traders said expectations for a smaller deficit were already priced into the market.</p>
<p>In options, no July contracts traded.</p>
