<title>SPAIN: Lower yields seen at Nov Spanish bond auctions.</title>
<headline>Lower yields seen at Nov Spanish bond auctions.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1996-11-04</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Spanish Treasury should see good demand and lower yields at its November bond auction scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, dealers said on Monday.</p>
<p>The three, five, 10- and 15- year notes and bonds are expected to be sold at the same level as on the secondary market. This means yields should remain between 15 to 70 basis points lower than at October's auctions, with the largest difference in 15-year bonds.</p>
<p>But dealers were cautious of forecasting ahead of Tuesday's U.S. presidential elections.</p>
<p>"The result seems to have been discounted already. But regardless of that, how the U.S. market reacts will influence the dollar and therefore our auctions," a dealer in Madrid said.</p>
<p>The three-year 7.80 percent bond was trading on Monday at 1230 GMT at around 102.76, yielding 6.75 percent.</p>
<p>The three-year bond offered on Tuesday has a newly-lowered coupon of 6.75 percent.</p>
<p>In the 10-year segment, the Treasury will offer a new tranche of the old 8.80 percent bond, maturity 2006, which was trading this morning at 106.39 at 7.80 percent. At the beginning of October, this bond was sold at a minimum price of 109.50 and maximum yield of 7.95 percent.</p>
<p>"People consider these levels really attractive. They're not far from where they were in October and dealers think they're higher than we'll see in coming months," a dealer said.</p>
<p>On the three and 10-year maturities the Treasury announced this morning a target volume between 275 and 325 billion pesetas. On October 3, it allotted 357 billion pesetas.</p>
<p>The amount to be tendered at Wednesday auctions of five and 15-year bonds has been set between 150 and 200 billion pesetas.</p>
<p>This is lower than the amount offered in October --200 and 250 billion pesetas-- when the Treasury allotted 244 billion pesetas on the same maturities.</p>
<p>The five-year 7.90 percent 2002 note was trading today at around 100.98, yielding 7.15 percent. In October it was sold at a minimum price of 99.70 and at a maximum yield of 7.319 percent.</p>
<p>The yield on the 15-year bond is forecast to fall the most. It was trading this morning at 100-100.10 yielding 7.22 percent while it was sold in October at around a maximum yield of 7.90 percent, at a marginal price of 103.90.</p>
