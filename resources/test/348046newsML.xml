<p>South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. offered Thursday to acquire the rest of troubled computer maker AST Research Inc. Thursday for $469 million in cash and assumed debt.</p>
<p>Samsung said the transaction was valued at about $469 million, including the assumption of about $307 million of third party debt.</p>
<p>In a statement, Samsung said it made the proposal in a letter to AST's independent directors. Under the plan, Samsung would purchase the 51 percent of AST it does not already own for $5.10 a share.</p>
<p>The move marks the latest effort by Samsung to assume control of AST. Despite substantial financial support from Samsung, AST's losses have been growing.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, AST said it lost $68 million, or $1.18 a share. That compared with a net loss of $128.6 million, or $2.88 per share, which came after a $13 million restructuring charge. Fourth quarter revenues slipped to $611.4 million from $612.9 million.</p>
<p>For all of 1996, AST's losses widened to $417.7 million, or $8.22 a share, from a loss of $263.2 million, or $7.01 a share, in 1995.</p>
<p>Revenues fell to $2.10 billion from $2.35 billion.</p>
<p>In its letter, Samsung said it believed the acquisition was the best way for AST to return to profitability.</p>
<p>"It is apparent that in order for AST to continue as a viable competitor in the intensely competitive PC industry, significant further support from Samsung will be necessary," Samsung said.</p>
<p>"The acquisition of 100 percent ownership of AST by Samsung would give AST direct access to Samsung's resources and would provide AST with the best reasonably available way to return to profitability. "</p>
<p>"Without Samsung's ongoing operational and financial support, AST's ability to survive as an independent company is questionable," the company added.</p>
<p>In a separate statement, AST said Samsung currently owns about 46 percent of AST, and owns options which, if exercised, would result in ownership of about 49 percent of the outstanding AST shares.</p>
<p>AST said its board of directors has formed a special committee, consisting of three independent directors, to evaluate Samsung's proposal, and to consider other options that may be available to AST, after consultation with appropriate legal and financial advisors.</p>
<p>Separately, AST said Yong Roo Song and Ho Moon Kang, have joined the company's board of directors, replacing Hyeon-Gon Kim and Hee Dong Yoo who have left to pursue other assignments within the Samsung Group.</p>
<p>Song, 50, is executive vice president and general manager in charge of Samsung Electronic's strategic planning office. Kang, 46, serves as senior executive managing director of Samsung Electronic's computer division.</p>
