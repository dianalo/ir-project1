<p>President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico has pledged to replace his country's anti-drug force, U.S. drug czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a brief interview, McCaffrey told Reuters Zedillo planned to restructure the National Institute for Combatting Drugs (INCD) and "create an entirely new drug police force ... (subject to) being polygraphed, drug tested and vetted."</p>
<p>He said Zedillo made the pledge during a visit by McCaffrey to Mexico last week.</p>
<p>McCaffrey spoke shortly before the House of Representatives voted to overturn President Bill Clinton's finding that Mexico is an ally in the war on drugs.</p>
<p>The House resolution, which would need Senate approval and faces the threat of a presidential veto, would give Mexico 90 days to improve its performance.</p>
<p>"Congress, like most Americans, is frustrated by the devastation caused by drugs ... They want our international partners to do their share, and we think senior leadership is committed to this in Mexico," McCaffrey said.</p>
<p>"The House may vote today, but I have faith in the good will of Congress. I welcome their oversight," said McCaffrey, whose official title is director of the White House office of National Drug Control Policy.</p>
<p>McCaffrey said he agreed that recent disclosures that Mexican officials at the highest levels were being paid for protection by drug traffickers indicated the problem in Mexico was "systemic."</p>
<p>"But Mexico isn't fighting only for our interests. The 94 million Mexican people are fighting for their lives against the threats, the corruption and the violence" in their own country caused by the drug trade, McCaffrey said.</p>
<p>McCaffrey's remarks came after he met with 100 inmates of the Gander Hill prison in Wilmington who are enrolled in a model drug treatment programme.</p>
