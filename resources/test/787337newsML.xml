<p>European stock markets closed with substantial losses on Friday, depressed by another sharp drop on Wall Street and weakness in the dollar and U.S. bond prices.</p>
<p>Sterling, hit hard by official indications that further British interest rate rises were off the menu in the near future, also tumbled on more heavy selling ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>"The sterling bubble has well and truly burst," said Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN Amro.</p>
<p>The pound shed more than six pfennigs from an early high against the mark, dropping below 2.92 marks, and hit a 10-month low against the dollar.</p>
<p>The U.S. currency suffered in the pound's wake and from the decline in U.S. asset markets, extending its losses on the day to around three pfennigs and three yen towards the end of London trading.</p>
<p>Wall Street, whose relentless rise to new peaks has helped drive European markets higher, lost more than 100 points or 1.3 percent on the Dow Jones industrial average inside 15 minutes of the New York opening.</p>
<p>This retreat, amid fears of higher U.S. interest rates, added to a drop of 71 points in the Dow on Thursday.</p>
<p>Losses by blue-chip shares on the London stock market promptly reached 1.5 percent, while the Frankfurt and Paris bourses were more than two percent adrift at their lows.</p>
<p>All rose from their depths as Wall Street reduced its deficit to around 95 points by the time European markets closed. But London still showed a net deficit of more than one percent and the Frankfurt and Paris bourses ended almost two percent down on the day.</p>
<p>The pound had gained around a quarter against major currencies so far this year but a weakening from recent peaks had taken some pressure off British exporters and helped boost London shares to new records.</p>
<p>The London stock market, Europe's biggest, hit new highs on Thursday when the Bank of England indicated that interest rates might not have to rise again for a while after the latest quarter point increase to seven percent.</p>
<p>But Friday's renewed decline in the pound gave no further support to leading British shares, which retreated on profit-taking. Market attention shifted to smaller capitalised stocks, which gained on the day.</p>
<p>German shares also took fright as currency turmoil and U.S. market weakness undermined sentiment and prompted investors to cash in profits after recent strong gains.</p>
<p>Losses were widespread, although financial sector shares in Frankfurt were buoyed by takeover talk.</p>
<p>In Paris, too, profit taking and the slide in the dollar -- bad news for exporters -- helped send the bourse lower.</p>
<p>"Sentiment has been very bullish but that changed on July 31," the day the last record was set, a Paris trader said. "There are concerns now about interest rates and Wall Street."</p>
<p>The dollar hit a two-week low against the yen and its weakest in a week versus the mark and Swiss franc. It also shed most of the week's gains on the French franc and the lira.</p>
<p>But in the morning it had revived for a while from an early downward blip against the mark.</p>
<p>Bundesbank Council member Ernst Welteke, speaking on German radio, said the central bank had already signalled it thought the dollar's correction was completed at 1.70 marks. This drove the dollar down as low as 1.8625 marks early on.</p>
<p>On reflection, currency market operators viewed the German economy as too weak to withstand higher interest rates to boost the mark despite Welteke's comments suggesting the Bundesbank did not want the mark to weaken further -- or the dollar to strengthen any more.</p>
<p>The dollar rose back above 1.87 marks, only to slip below 1.85 later.</p>
<p>Speculation that the Bundesbank will act to boost money market rates has grown as the dollar has scored near eight-year highs in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The dollar also retreated against the yen, affected by market concern that a widening in Japan's trade surplus with the United States could spark renewed trade tensions.</p>
<p>A report showed Japan's current account surplus leapt nearly 56 percent in June from a year earlier and that the trade surplus rose nearly 19 percent in the same period.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1530 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted around 1.8455 marks and 115.13 yen in late European business, well below 1.8744 and 118.55 a day earlier.</p>
<p>Sterling was at 2.9168 marks and $1.5805, down from 2.9695 and $1.5861 on Thursday, after lows of 2.9150 and $1.5672.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT THE EUROPEAN CLOSE</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index finished down 55.5 points or 1.09 percent at 5,031.3.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The DAX index ended bourse floor trade 60.20 points or 1.36 percent lower at 4,354.15. In later electronic trading the IBIS DAX index closed down 85.77 points or 1.94 percent at 4,342.31.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 index ended with a loss of 60.07 points or 1.97 percent at 2,996.27.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS AT THE EUROPEAN CLOSE</p>
<p>Gold rose to end London trading around $324.85 an ounce, up from the afternoon fix of $323.70 and Thursday's London close of $322.15. Silver gained two cents to $4.41.</p>
