<p>A lieutenant colonel in the Illinois Air National Guard allegedly set up a video camera in the ceiling of his unit's women's shower, The Chicago Sun-Times reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The unnamed officer, who heads up a refueling operation for the reserve unit at O'Hare International Airport, was suspended without pay after the alleged voyeurism was discovered late last year, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the National Guard said the results of an Air Force investigation had been turned over to the U.S. Attorney's office in Chicago. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Jim Burns said the office had been apprised of the situation but would not comment.</p>
<p>The U.S. military has recently been beset by a series of embarrassing sex scandals, including a spate of trials of military personnel charged with having sex with underlings and cases of adultery that have damaged or ruined military careers.</p>
<p>The Sun-Times, quoting a military source, reported that a member of the guard unit saw the video camera taped to pipes above a dislodged ceiling tile, and reported it. A television monitor connected to the camera was found in the lieutenant colonel's office.</p>
