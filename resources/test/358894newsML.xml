<p>President Fidel Ramos on Wednesday vowed to bring to justice the killers of a Roman Catholic bishop gunned down near his cathedral in the southern Philippines.</p>
<p>Bishop Benjamin de Jesus was shot six times on Tuesday after entering his jeep parked near Our Lady of Mount Carmel cathedral on southern Jolo island.</p>
<p>Former Moslem guerrilla chief Nur Misuari, now governor of a semi-autonomous southern Moslem region, also pledged to help track down the two assassins. One of the killers was described by church officials as a boy possibly as young as 10 years old.</p>
<p>Bishop de Jesus was the highest-ranking prelate killed in the troubled region of Mindanao, which continues to be racked by secessionist violence despite a peace deal signed by Manila last year with Misuari's Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF).</p>
<p>"The government will exert all efforts to ensure that the perpetrators of the senseless killing are apprehended...and put before the bars of justice as soon as possible," a presidential palace statement quoted Ramos as saying.</p>
<p>Ramos, in a letter to the bishop's family, expressed outrage and condemned the killing, it said.</p>
<p>Misuari told reporters in southern Cotabato city he had ordered MNLF commanders to help the police arrest the killers.</p>
<p>"This is another challenge that we have to surmount, another serious blow to our continuing peace initiative," he said. "Let the death of Bishop de Jesus open our eyes to the painful reality that peace building is a work fraught with pains and sacrifices."</p>
<p>Misuari last September signed a peace pact with Manila, ending the MNLF's 24-year revolt for Moslem autonomy in Mindanao and adjacent islands.</p>
<p>A breakaway rebel faction, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), is holding exploratory talks with Manila on a separate peace deal.</p>
<p>But the Abu Sayyaf fundamentalist group, blamed by the military for bombings and kidnappings in the south in recent years, has refused negotiations with the government.</p>
<p>Police have not identitied the killers or established a motive for the shooting.</p>
