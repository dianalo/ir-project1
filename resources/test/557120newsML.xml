<p>Portugal's promotion to developed from emerging market on indices produced by Morgan Stanley will draw bourse investment from international funds which ignored it in the past, analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The local index of leading blue chips responded to the announcement from the U.S. investment bank on Wednesday by surging around three percent on Friday even though the switch takes effect only in December.</p>
<p>"It is an early Christmas present and very positive that Portugal is now recognised as a developed market," said Pierre Boulle, chief analyst at Lisbon brokers Fincor.</p>
<p>The market was closed on Thursday for the May 1 holiday.</p>
<p>Analysts said major companies would benefit the most as they would be targeted by foreign investment funds, many of which had taken little interest in Portugal when it ranked as an emerging market.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) issues indices covering various world markets and its rankings are closely followed by international fund managers.</p>
<p>Portugal's inclusion in the index of developed European markets, the MSCI Europe, will boost the number of members to 15. Its capitalisation, as of April, was calculated at 0.60 percent of the whole, the same as the index's current smallest member, Ireland.</p>
<p>"The taking of the decision to move Portugal to the developed markets is more important than the timing of the move (effective December 2)," said Paulo Araujo of Schroders Securities in London.</p>
<p>"It is preferable to be a small part of the MSCI of developed markets than a bigger part of emerging markets," he added, referring to Portugal's weighting in the various indices.</p>
<p>"Portugal is going to be part of an index that is watched internationally by important investment funds, U.S. funds amongst others," added Boulle.</p>
<p>Portugal will, from December, be included in the MSCI EAFE, which covers markets outside North America, the MSCI World, the MSCI Europe and the MSCI Europe ex-UK.</p>
<p>On Friday, most attention was focused on blue chips such as Banco Comercial Portugues, Portugal's largest private sector banking group, which rose over 6.5 percent to 2,820 escudos. Portugal Telecom was up nearly four percent at 6,656 escudos.</p>
<p>The PSI20 index of the 20 top shares was up 3.3 percent.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley pointed to Portugal's economic progress and the size of its equity market which, while still relatively small, had expanded quickly.</p>
<p>In mid-year, Portugal's Socialist government plans to partially privatise state-owned electricity concern EDP, giving a further boost to market capitalisation.</p>
<p>EDP, valued at some 1.5 trillion escudos ($8.7 billion), will be the largest privatisation so far carried out in Portugal with the government planning to float between 20 and 30 percent.</p>
<p>With the Morgan Stanley decision, the success of the EDP privatisation was guaranteed, analysts said. "It is a present from the gods for EDP," said Mari Vargas of Santander Investment in London.</p>
<p>"There are many investors who are not present in Portugal and who from now on are going to start looking at this market," she said.</p>
