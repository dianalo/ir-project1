<p>New Zealand First leader Winston Peters said on Monday that he hoped a decision on forming a government would be made by Tuesday.</p>
<p>Speaking on Radio New Zealand, Peters rejected the idea that that three of the 17 members of New Zealand First would desert the party if it formed a coalition with the ruling conservative National Party.</p>
<p>"I'd be surprised. I'd be appalled," Peters said.</p>
<p>NZ First holds the balance of power and has been in coalition talks with National and the left-leaning Labour Party since the October 12 election.</p>
<p>Peters said the option of a minority government was still open but he was confident a government would still be formed.</p>
<p>The NZ First caucus and council meet again on Tuesday and Peters said he expected a decision on which part to go with would be made then.</p>
<p>Peters said he hoped his party would arrive at the decision by consensus but it would be put to a vote if necessary.</p>
<p>"If it comes to that it will be a vote," Peters said.</p>
<p>Asked about the likelihood of a deal being done with neither party, Peters said: "It always has been a possibility... but not one I believe New Zealand First favours."</p>
<p>"We are confident of forming a government but you can never be certain of it until the results are in," he said.</p>
<p>"We are at this stage almost certain to go into a government but I don't know what the outcome of those discussions will be tomorrow until those discussions have taken price.</p>
<p>He said the only reason for not going into a government would be the perception that the price to be paid was too high in terms of breaking NZ First's principles. "Whilst it is almost certain we will go into coalition, you can rule nothing out it," he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Labour Party Leader Helen Clark said on Monday she was still cautiously hopeful that New Zealand First would choose Labour as its coalition partner.</p>
<p>"We've worked hard to put a good proposal together and I remain cautiously optimistic," Clark said in a radio interview.</p>
<p>Caretaker Prime Minister Jim Bolger said his conservative National Party would form a "very comfortable mix" with nationalist New Zealand First.</p>
<p>"I think we would form a very comfortable mix, a very comfortable fit. Obviously there has been a lot of give and take in the negotiations, it's been detailed right across the board...I think we couled make a very, very constructive government," Bolger said in a radio interview.</p>
