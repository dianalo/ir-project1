<p>Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad al-Abdulla al-Sabah was taken to hospital on Tuesday for medical tests following a sudden health problem.</p>
<p>"Thank God he is in good condition," said an official who accompanied Sheikh Saad to hospital. He refused to elaborate.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear what Sheikh Saad, born in 1930, was suffering from but one Western diplomatic source said there were indications he was in good condition.</p>
<p>Sheikh Saad was at the airport on Monday with Kuwait's Emir Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah to receive Congo's President Pascal Lissouba. Sheikh Saad, prime minister and crown prince since 1978, later visited Lissouba at his residence.</p>
<p>"I heard it could be general fatigue," said a senior Kuwaiti oil industry executive. "I think he is now resting at hospital."</p>
<p>Kuwait, a founder of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, produces about two million barrels of oil per day. It controls 10 percent of the world's proven oil reserves.</p>
<p>The emiri court earlier on Tuesday issued a statement on the official Kuwaiti news agency (KUNA) telling citizens that Sheikh Saad's condition was "extremely reassuring" after suffering a "sudden indisposition".</p>
<p>Sheikh Saad, educated in Kuwait and at Britain's Hendon Police Training School, has steered the government through turbulent times at home and abroad.</p>
<p>He started his career with Kuwait's police in 1945, becoming chief of police and public security in 1961. He held the defence and interior portifolios until a year before the 1979 Islamic revolution in non-Arab Iran across the narrow Gulf.</p>
<p>Hours after Iraqi troops crossed the border into Kuwait on August 2, 1990, Sheikh Saad vowed in a broadcast from a secret location to fight "until we clean their (Iraqi) treachery from our land".</p>
<p>Seven years after the U.S.-led military coalition defeated Iraq in the 1991 Gulf War and freed Kuwait from a seven-month Iraqi occupation, Sheikh Saad is strongly opposed to even consider offers to hold direct contacts with Baghdad.</p>
