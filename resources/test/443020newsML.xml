<headline>OPTIONS - Dlr/yen risk reversals flip for yen puts.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-03-14</dateline>

<p>Yen puts in dollar/yen options became more expensive than yen calls for the first time since the dollar's uptrend stalled shortly after the Group of Seven (G7) meeting in early February, dealers said.</p>
<p>That, combined with the fact that implied volatilities now tended to rise with the dollar, indicated the market was bracing for a resumption of the dollar's uptrend, they added.</p>
<p>The dollar briefly climbed early in U.S. trading above 124 yen for the first time in three weeks before pulling back on profit-taking, paving the way for a retest of February highs just below 125 yen.  </p>
<p>"It seems people are starting to think the dollar's consolidation could be coming to an end and a higher dollar is on the horizon," said Kyoko Hiramatsu, a senior trader at Bank of Yokohama in New York.</p>
<p>Risk reversal, which reflects pricing differential between puts and calls, for one-month 25-delta options stood at 0.1/0.3 percent skewed for yen puts at U.S. midsession against around par late on Thursday.</p>
<p>It had been favoring yen calls for about a month as the dollar topped out after the G7 stated in their communique that the U.S. currency's correction from its 1995 lows was over.  </p>
<p>One-month implied volatility pulled back to 9.5/9.7 percent by U.S. midday, in line with spot's retreat, after climbing earlier toward 10 percent. It had ended on Thursday at 9.4/9.7 percent.</p>
<p>"It's come back off a little bit, but there aren't very many people selling," a U.S. bank trader in Chicago said.</p>
<p>Traders said the market had been split for a while on spot's direction as the dollar travelled to and fro between 120 and 125 yen after the G7 meeting.</p>
<p>"As we climbed above 124 yen, the scale tipped toward the bullish side," Hiramatsu at Bank of Yokohama said.  </p>
<p>However, traders warned that risk reversals have been a lagging indicator that often betrayed their followers when they flipped.</p>
<p>Still, Hiramatsu said the strength in back-end volatilities was a sign of growing anticipation of a higher dollar. One-year dollar/yen stood at 10.75/10.95 percent, up a quarter point from Thursday.</p>
<p>Traders noted that a recent buildup of knockout options with barrier prices at and slightly beyond 125 yen meant that both spot and volatilities could spike up sharply once the barriers were broken.  </p>
<p>Such concerns, combined with caution ahead of the March 25 Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting and the March 31 fiscal year-end for most Japanese corporations underpinned volatilities.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark volatilities were relatively stagnant as the dollar gyrated in familiar territory around 1.70 marks.</p>
<p>One-month dollar/mark was steady to slightly softer at 9.1//9.3 percent. One-year was steady at 9.5/9.7, virtually unchanged.</p>
