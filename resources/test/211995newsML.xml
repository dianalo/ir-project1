<p>Lawyers will begin closing arguments on Monday in the war crimes trial of Bosnian Serb Dusan Tadic, taking the seven-month trial into its final phase before a verdict from the three-judge panel.</p>
<p>Tadic, a 41-year-old former cafe owner and police reserve officer, denies murdering and torturing non-Serbs during Serb ethnic cleansing in north western Bosnia in 1992.</p>
<p>The trial, which began on May 7, is the first war crimes trial to be heard by an international body since the Tokyo and Nuremberg trials in the aftermath of World War Two and the first full case at the U.N. criminal tribunal for ex-Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said on Friday the prosecution, led by Grant Niemann, would begin its review of its case against Tadic, followed by closing arguments from leading defence lawyer Michail Wladimiroff.</p>
<p>"I don't know how long the process will take, and no one but the parties can know, but I expect closing arguments would be finished after three days," said Chartier.</p>
<p>A verdict from the judges, led by Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, would not be on the cards before the new year, said Chartier, although he declined to comment on speculation the judges could deliberate until next March.</p>
<p>"I have no idea when the verdict will come and I wouldn't raise any expectations, it's really up to them. I don't expect it before the end of the year, definitely not," he said.</p>
<p>The prosecution has portrayed Tadic, a martial arts instructor, as a committed Serb nationalist who became actively involved in terrorising non-Serbs in his home region of Prijedor in the spring and summer of 1992.</p>
<p>They have presented testimony alleging Tadic was seen at the notorious Serb-run Omarska detention camp, standing by in one gruesome incident in which one prisoner died after having a testicle bitten off by another.</p>
<p>One prosecution witness was admonished by Kirk McDonald after pointing dramatically at Tadic and denouncing him as the "garbage" who nearly beat him to death with a baton.</p>
<p>But the prosecutors' case has suffered big setbacks, with specific rape charges dropped early in the trial because a key witness withdrew and lurching into farce in October after it had to drop testimony from a witness when it emerged he had been forced to give false evidence by Bosnian military police.</p>
<p>Defence lawyers, who say Tadic is the victim of mistaken identity, have repeatedly pressed prosecution witnesses to admit that their recollection of events four years ago has been tainted by media reports and bitterness towards Serbs.</p>
<p>The defence says Tadic, close friends with a number of Moslems and deeply embedded in a multi-ethnic community, also became a casualty of the Bosnian war after being forced to leave his home and business in the town of Kozarac.</p>
<p>But, it says, Tadic was never at the Omarska camp and was on duty as a traffic policeman, spending nights with his wife and two daughters while the crimes against non-Serbs were committed.</p>
<p>If found guilty by the judges Tadic could face life imprisonment, although Chartier said he would not serve his sentence at the tribunal's detention unit in the Hague, where he has been held since April 1995.</p>
<p>States which have expressly agreed to enforce sentences imposed by the tribunal, with or without reservations comprise: Bosnia and Herzegovina; Croatia; Iran; Finland; Norway and Pakistan. Others willing to take those convicted of war crimes subject to reservations are Denmark; Germany; the Netherlands; Spain and Sweden, Chartier said.</p>
<p>A tribunal statement said that should Tadic be found guilty prosecutors and defence would be allowed to present any information which could affect the sentencing. Tadic would have 30 days within which to appeal against a judgement or sentence.</p>
