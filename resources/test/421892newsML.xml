<p>Swedish construction and real estate group Skanska AB said on Wednesday it had signed an agreement in principle to merge its Myresjo Tra saw mill operations with forestry group RorviksGruppen.  </p>
<p>The merger is conditional on RorviksGruppen being split into an engineering unit and a sawmill operation and that both units are listed on the stock exchange, Skanska said in a statement.</p>
<p>"After the split of operations, the intention is that Myresjo Tra AB will merge with the sawmill operations through a non-cash issue whereby Myresjo AB will hold a 40 percent interest in the new sawmill group," the company said.</p>
<p>The new sawmill group will have an annual production capacity of nearly 500,000 cubic metres at eight sawmills and sales of about one billion crowns, Skanska said.</p>
<p>The Myresjo group's forest holdings, with Boxholm Skogar and subsidiaries, are not affected by the merger, Skanska said.</p>
