<p>The Pakistani cabinet approved a proposal on Wednesday to give a $220 million contract to France's Alcatel to launch a Pakistani communications satellite, a government statement said.</p>
<p>But the statement, issued after a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said Alacatel must give a certificate that it had not paid any kickbacks for the project, which was initiated in late 1993 under a previous government.</p>
<p>The PAKSAT satellite "will be launched on behalf of Pakistan by M/s Alcatel Espace under a 15 years' licence and will carry 26 transponders", it said</p>
<p>"The process of tendering and selection for development, deployment and operation of a satellite system for Pakistan was initiated in late 1993 and a letter of intent was issued in April last year," the statement said.</p>
<p>It said Sharif directed the Communications Ministry at Wednesday's cabinet meeting to negotiate "further possible concession" with Alcatel to ensure that the country's interests were fully protected.</p>
<p>"While allowing the proposal for grant of the contract to M/s Alcatel Espace, the cabinet directed the ministry...to obtain a certificate from the company to the effect that no commission or any other extra payment has been made to any one in this regard and that if it was so found in the future, the contract would be liable to cancellation," it said.</p>
<p>Sharif also directed the Law and Justice Ministry to draft a legislation to institutionalise submission of such certificates by companies winning contracts, it said.</p>
<p>The statement quoted the prime minister as saying that "such foreign companies should also be subjected to punitive action under the proposed legislation in case they indulged in malpractices and doled out commissions and kickbacks to clinch the deal".</p>
