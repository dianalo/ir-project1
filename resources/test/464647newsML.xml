<p>Australia's largest petrol (gasoline) retailer, Australian Petroleum Pty Ltd (Ampol) said on Monday that Australians living in rural areas on average paid up to 7.8 cents a litre more for petrol than those living in cities.</p>
<p>"Outback areas often have high freight costs, but high prices in less remote country towns are usually the result of high retail margins," Ampol managing director Ian Blackburne said in a statement.  </p>
<p>A survey by Ampol shows Western Australia recorded the highest discrepancy in average city and rural prices in February of 7.8 cents a litre.</p>
<p>South Australia was second, with city drivers paying on average 6.8 cents a litre less.</p>
<p>In Queensland, rural prices were 5.3 cents higher while in Victoria they were 4.2 cents higher, Ampol said.</p>
<p>Australia's most populated state, New South Wales, showed a difference of 4.6 cents a litre, Ampol said.  </p>
<p>The Northern Territory and Tasmania state, two of the least populated regions of Australia, recorded the smallest discrepancies of 2.1 cents and 1.2 cents respectively, Ampol said.</p>
<p>Ampol owns or leases about 1,200 retail service stations in Australia. It is owned 50 percent by Caltex Australia Ltd and Pioneer International Ltd</p>
