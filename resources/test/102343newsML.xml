<p>Cuban President Fidel Castro says U.S. President Bill Clinton is influenced in his Cuba policy by electoral considerations and he wishes Clinton would "stop being a candidate and start being a statesman."</p>
<p>Castro, speaking to journalists at a reception at the British Embassy in Havana on Monday night, was asked how he viewed Clinton's prospects for re-election and whether he hoped he might ease Cuba policy if he wins a second term.</p>
<p>Castro said he was not going to predict the result of the November election.</p>
<p>But he added that "perhaps one day he (Clinton) will stop being a candidate and become a statesman".</p>
<p>Castro said he understood that Clinton was currently influenced by electoral concerns.</p>
<p>He did not elaborate, but most Cuban officials believe that Clinton is influenced by the Cuban-American lobby for electoral reasons.</p>
<p>Clinton in March approved a tightening of the longstanding U.S. embargo on Cuba after Cuban jet fighters shot down two small private U.S. planes piloted by Florida-based Cubans.</p>
<p>Castro said he watched Sunday's presidential campaign debate between Clinton and Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole.</p>
<p>"I was bored," he said. "It was a lot of theatre and very little substance."</p>
<p>He reiterated Cuba's view that Washington should sort out affairs at home rather than trying to push Cuba into political change.</p>
<p>"If he (Clinton) wants more democracy in Cuba he should bring more democracy to the United States," Castro said.</p>
