<p>Sweden's Riksbank (central bank) is expected to lower its key repo rate, the central rate of its three tier system, by up to 15 basis points on Tuesday, a Reuters poll found on Monday.</p>
<p>A survey of 18 analysts found 14 expected the Riksbank to lower the repo rate by 15 basis points to 5.10 percent at its weekly tender.</p>
<p>The other four analysts forecast a cut of 10 basis points.</p>
<p>This would be the 19th cut to the repo rate so far this year and analysts expected the cuts to continue, with an average forecast for the repo to bottom at 4.68 percent this autumn.</p>
<p>The repo rate, which is the Riksbank's main tool for contolling money market liquidity, started the year at 8.91 percent but has been trimmed regularly in a low inflation climate.</p>
<p>The market's expectations of a further rate cut this week were given support by comments made by Riksbank governor Urban Backstrom at the Swedish Trade Union Conferedation (LO) annual conference at the weekend.</p>
<p>Backstrom said he still saw room for further rate cuts even though inflation is expected to rise in the autumn.</p>
<p>Asked how much scope remained for more easing, Backstrom said a central bank inflation forecast due out September 24 would contain key indications of this.</p>
<p>He said the central bank must analyse incoming statistics about the possibility for more rate cuts.</p>
<p>The Riksbank last lowered its interest rate corridor, marked out by the deposit and lending rates, on August 15. The deposit and lending rates currently stand at 4.75 percent and 6.25 percent respectively.</p>
<p>"It is possible that the Riksbank will wait for the inflation report to come out before the pace of cutting rates slows," said Stephanie Pheiffer, economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell told Reuters.</p>
<p>Analysts interviewed for the poll were from Aragon, Carnegie, Consensus, Den Danske, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Foreningsbanken, Hagstomer &amp; Qviberg, Handelsbanken, J P Morgan, Nomura Bank, Nordbanken, PaineWebber, Salomon Brothers, S-E-Banken, Swedbank, Union Bank of Switzerland, Unibank, and Ohman Fondkommission.</p>
