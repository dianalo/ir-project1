<p>The Australian dollar sagged to its lowest local close in two months Wednesday as a rampant rumour mill chewed up support.</p>
<p>Traders said some real selling of AUD/yen was seen out of Tokyo but most of the fall was due to speculation, much of it far-fetched, about an imminent cut in official cash rates.</p>
<p>The talk actually grew clamorous enough to draw a rare official denial from the Reserve Bank, but by then much of the damage had been done and the dollar needed bids from local exporters to prevent a test of key US$0.7850 support.  </p>
<p>By 4.45 pm (0545 GMT) it had been harried to US$0.7875/80, its lowest local close since November 8, from an early US$0.7900/05 and US$0.7903/08 late here Tuesday.</p>
<p>The froth of rate rumours began early in the forwards market with talk the Reserve Bank policy-making board had met in secret on Tuesday and the bank would announce a rate cut at its usual 9.30 am (2230 GMT) slot this morning.</p>
<p>The board does not typically meet in January, but the Machiavellian-minded noted the last time it had was 1992 when a special meeting was called on January 7 which sanctioned a cut for the very next day.  </p>
<p>In the event the RBA remained silent, but the rumour mill was working overtime and produced the wild idea the RBA would ease at 4.00 pm this afternoon.</p>
<p>Analysts found it fanciful that the bank would suddenly and without warning break procedures faithfully followed for seven years, particularly as it had only eased last month.</p>
<p>"If the RBA had cut today it would be pressing the panic button, and the RBA does not hit panic buttons," said Steve North, forex sales manager at Chase Manhattan.</p>
<p>"It's not as if the economy is falling in a hole or anything, growth is still running around 3.0 percent."  </p>
<p>The market, however, had become paranoid since the RBA caught it napping with the last easing on December 11 and took an increasingly defensive stance as the day wore on, buying bills and selling the dollar.</p>
<p>In the end the bank took the unusual step of issuing an official denial, saying there was no truth to the talk.</p>
<p>But even this produced only a temporary lull in the chatter and dealers were planning to be on guard Thursday, and every morning until the next scheduled RBA meeting on February 4.</p>
<p>Bulls feared a cut would narrow the dollar's yield premium to levels which were no longer attractive to offshore investors.  </p>
<p>There had already been concerns the December cut to 6.0 percent would put an end to the Japanese hunger for A$ denominated paper which was a feature of 1996.</p>
<p>There was some relief Tuesday when buying for a sizeable yen/A$ dual currency samurai bond -- up to A$500 million -- was detected in the market and there was talk of around another A$200 million to do this week.</p>
<p>Today's rumours seemed to threatened that revival and sent the dollar off to 90.70/80 yen from 91.05/15 late Tuesday. The weakness was wide spread on the crosses and left the currency at 58.6 on its trade weighted index, down from 58.8 Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The technical picture had also darkened following a fall through US$0.7910 support last week and many chart watchers expected a test of US$0.7850 to develop soon.</p>
<p>A breach there would be very bearish and could snowball into a stop-loss rout past old support at US$0.7810 and into a major downtrend toward 75 cents.</p>
<p>The weakness of gold was also cited as a negative factor for the dollar -- the yellow metal is Australia's third largest export. Dealers were sceptical, however, saying the link between the two had not been strong since the 1980's.</p>
