<p>Swiss-Swedish electrical engineering company ABB AB on Thursday denied rumours that the company was about to announce a new large order.</p>
<p>"We always have a number of orders in our pipeline, but that there is a large order on the way -- this I don't know anything about," ABB spokesman Erik Osterberg told Reuters.  </p>
<p>At 1400 GMT the share was trading at 819 crowns, up 21 on yesterday's close, with brokers attributing the rise to market rumours in Switzerland and Sweden that ABB was on the verge of winning a large order.</p>
