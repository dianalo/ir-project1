<headline>CSCE world sugar ends lower, July support intact.</headline>

<p>CSCE world sugar prices closed moderately weaker as players remained focused on the nearby switch, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The market remained under a lot of pressure from commission houses who were selling May/July once again," a broker said.</p>
<p>Prices climbed slightly higher on the open amid trade and commission house buying, but quickly eased below unchanged in a slight correction from Friday's rally. Light producer selling helped to stymie early gains, traders said.</p>
<p>Most-active July is expected to maintain support at 11.00 cents amid talk of buying from Russia. While dealers agreed that the rumors probably came from business done in the last week, they said it could provid support to the market in the near term.</p>
<p>Additionally, the trade remains short the July contract, dealers said, although some players are willing to sell the most-active month on its strength.</p>
<p>Volume was estimated at only 23,663 lots compared with Friday's official 44,687.</p>
<p>July ended down 0.01 cent at 11.08, having ranged from 11.13 to 11.05 cents. May settled 0.05 lower at 11.24 cents, while the outer months closed unchanged to 0.03 firmer.</p>
<p>Resistance was pegged at 11.18 cents in July.</p>
<p>The last trading day for the May contract is April 30.</p>
