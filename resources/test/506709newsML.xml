<headline>Dlr up at US close, traders eye rate differentials.</headline>

<p>The dollar closed higher amid expectations for continued low interest rates in Japan and Europe and higher rates in the U.S., experts said.</p>
<p>Yet the possibility of central bank intervention to stem the dollar's rise plus uncertainty before the release of a crucial inflation report on Tuesday introduced a note of caution into currency markets.</p>
<p>"I think what's propelling the dollar just fractionally higher is you're rewarded for owning dollars on a short-term basis by the interest rate differential," said John McCarthy, senior vice president at ING Capital Markets.</p>
<p>"The general feeling is (U.S.) rates will continue to move up and rates in Europe and Japan are, at best, static for the moment," McCarthy added.</p>
<p>Remarks by the Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Yasuo Matsushita on Monday reaffirmed the view that rockbottom rates in Japan are not about to turn higher.</p>
<p>Matsushita told a group of business leaders in Tokyo that the central bank would continue to conduct monetary policy with an emphasis on strengthening Japan's economic recovery.</p>
<p>The dollar closed at 126.53/63 yen and 1.7302/07 marks, up from 126.13/23 yen and 1.7210/20 marks at the open.</p>
<p>With the dollar trading near its highest level in more than four and a half years against the yen, traders remained wary that the United States and Japan could intervene in the foreign exchange market to prop up the Japanese currency.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Japanese daily newspaper, Mainichi Shimbun, reported that Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told cabinet ministers on Friday that Japan will act in the currency markets if the dollar rises to 127 to 128 yen.</p>
<p>But when questioned by reporters on Monday, Mitsuzuka denied having mentioned a specific exchange rate at which the BOJ would intervene to sell dollars for yen.</p>
<p>Indeed, some traders briefly sold dollars during Monday afternoon following news that Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the United States will intervene "when it's appropriate and not act when it's not appropriate."</p>
<p>Analysts, however, were careful not to read too much into the Treasury Secretary's remarks.</p>
<p>"Our own feeling here in New York is that Mr. Rubin is a trader, so he knows the trader's mentality," said David Ethridge, director of currency analysis at MMS International in North America. "By stating this kind of 'on-the-one-hand' type of approach, (Rubin) keeps the market guessing."</p>
<p>Rubin was formerly a co-chairman of Goldman Sachs and Co.</p>
<p>Shortly after the impact from the Rubin statements faded from the market, the dollar soared to 1.7310 marks, its highest level in more than three years. Traders attributed the late surge primarily to dollar purchases by a large Wall Street investment bank.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, The Labor Department will release the consumer price index (CPI) for March. Economists polled by Reuters expected the CPI rose 0.2 percent in March. Excluding food and energy items, CPI is seen up 0.3 percent.</p>
<p>"I expect that what people are looking for is for CPI to confirm that growth is still pretty strong and to suggest a rate hike either at the May or July meeting," said Cynthia Cooley, a foreign exchange analyst and trader at United Gulf Bank of Bahrain in Boston.</p>
<p>Fed policymakers are scheduled to meet on May 20 and again on July 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The dollar ended at 1.4705/15 Swiss francs and Canadian $1.3994/99, up from 1.4652/62 francs and C$1.3975/80 at the open. Sterling fell to $1.6200/05 from $1.6230/40. The Australian dollar rose to $0.7795/00 from $0.7785/90.</p>
<p>Analysts also noted concern in the foreign exchange market on Monday about the possibility that stocks might selloff again after the Dow industrials index tumbled some 148 points on Friday. Initially, stock prices did decline on Monday. But the Dow industrials recovered late in the session to finish up 60 points at 6451.90.</p>
