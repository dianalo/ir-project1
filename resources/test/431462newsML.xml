<p>The Swedish government will on Friday pave the way for a cut in its stake in Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) to a possible 35 percent from its present 50 percent, a government offical said on Monday.</p>
<p>A selloff could help pay estimated SAS bills of $5.5 billion over the next 10 years for new aircraft and other expenses, although the government says that its request to parliament for enabling legislation does not mean that a sale is imminent.</p>
<p>"To reduce the state's stake is not on the agenda right now," Stefan Back, deputy assistant undersecretary at the Communications Ministry, told Reuters.  </p>
<p>The proposal would also extend Sweden's SAS alliance with Norway and Denmark to the year 2020.</p>
<p>The partners have for years discussed changes which would make it easier to attract new capital to SAS.</p>
<p>"The three companies holding SAS have recently been streamlined to become easier to invest in," Back said.</p>
<p>Back said it was still unclear to what level state ownership could be reduced, but a figure of 35 percent had been mentioned.</p>
<p>Main private owners of SAS Sweden are the Wallenberg family's key holding company Investor, with 18.5 percent and Swedbank funds with 10.9 percent.</p>
