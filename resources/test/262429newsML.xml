<p>Egypt's Cairo Precision Industries, an affiliate of the Olympic Electric group of companies, on Tuesday offered investors 300,000 new shares worth some 25 million pounds ($7 million) to finance production activities.</p>
<p>The minimum application accepted will be for 25 shares at a fixed price of 85.00 pounds plus 0.50 pounds as issuance fees per share, the firm said in a published announcement. The shares are rarely traded on the Egyptian bourse.</p>
<p>Applications will be accepted for 60 days from December 24, the firm said. The offer, however, can be closed after at least 10 days in the eventof it being covered.</p>
<p>The Commercial International Bank and Commercial International Investment Company are working as agents.</p>
<p>The share offer will cut the parent company's stake in the heater manufacturer from about 62 percent. The group has just recently sold off a part of its 80 percent stake, a brokerage source told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The group will keep its majority stake after the issue," she said.</p>
<p>Other parties, including mutual funds and banks, now hold the remaining 38 percent of 1.5 million shares in the firm.</p>
<p>The firm said it has approved a scheme that would allow the group employees to own a maximum of five percent of the shares. It was not clear whether it covers the new issue or existing shares as well.</p>
<p>Cairo Precision was set up in 1991, but the parent company Olympic Electric has been producing water heaters for 33 years.</p>
<p>Cairo Precision's shareholders equity rose to 18.841 million pounds in calendar 1995 from 11.353 million in the previous year, the firm added.</p>
<p>It forecast net after tax profits to increase to 19.046 million pounds in 1997 from 15.931 in 1996. A group official said earlier this month profits were 14.755 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>He also said net sales would also rise to 59.968 million pounds this year from 53.849 million in 1995.</p>
