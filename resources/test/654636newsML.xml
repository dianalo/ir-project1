<p>Finnish steel group Rautaruukki Oy said on Wednesday it expected full-year 1997 profits to improve on last year and that profits for the second tertial (May-August) would be clearly up on the year-ago period.</p>
<p>"The profit for the whole of 1997 should be better than that for 1996 provided that steel markets develop as forecast," Rautaruukki said in a statement with its January-April results.</p>
<p>"The group's profit for the second four-month period is expected to be significantly higher than for the corresponding period in the previous year," it said.  </p>
<p>In May-August 1996, Rautaruukki's operating profit was 230 million markka, profit before extraordinary items and tax 95 million and net profit 60 million markka.</p>
<p>As economic growth was gathering pace, demand for steel products was expected to rise further in Europe, Rautaruukki said, adding demand for steel products in the United States and the Far East would remain strong.</p>
<p>"The prices of steel products are forecast to continue to rise during 1997," it said.</p>
<p>Consolidated turnover for 1997 was expected to rise to about 13.5 billion markka from 12.8 billion in 1996, it said. @</p>
