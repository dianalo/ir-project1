<p>Former South African fly-half Joel Stransky became the latest big-name overseas signing in English rugby when he completed his move to first division Leicester on Thursday.</p>
<p>But he immediately stressed that he had not given up hope of again playing for the Springboks.</p>
<p>Stransky follows his World Cup winning captain Francois Pienaar who signed for Saracens last week in the lengthening line of high-profile foreign imports into the new professional game in England.</p>
<p>It is a list which includes former Wallabies Michael Lynagh and Tony Daley, Argentine Federico Mendez and the three Frenchmen Philippe Sella, Laurent Cabannes and Laurent Benezech as well as the more traditional numbers of Irish, Welsh and Scots.</p>
<p>Stransky's decision to move to England is hardly a surprise. Eighteen months ago he became a national hero when his drop goal in extra-time secured the Webb Ellis Trophy for South Africa in a dramatic final against New Zealand but his form slumped dramatically during the 1996 season.</p>
<p>After losing the Springbok number 10 jersey to Henry Honiball, he was then overlooked for the current tour to Argentina, France and Wales and by the end of the season was struggling to hold down a place in the Western Province side.</p>
<p>As part of the deal, however, which will net Stransky an estimated 300,000 pounds sterling ($495,000) over the course of his two-and-a-half year contract, Leicester have agreed with the South African Rugby Football Union to allow the Springboks first call on his services.</p>
<p>But the move, coming while out of favour with national coach Andre Markgraaff, is unlikely to improve his chances of returning to the side. Even so, Stransky remained positive about his international future.</p>
<p>"As a player I feel I have a great chance of playing for South Africa again and Francois (Pienaar) is in the same position," he said.</p>
<p>"We've both had clashes with the management and while I would like to think I could make the side, whether they pick me again is another story."</p>
<p>Stransky will now have the opportunity of teaming up with another World Cup winner in the shape of Leicester coach Bob Dwyer. He masterminded the Wallabies success in 1991 and is now eager to make the Tigers the top club in England.</p>
<p>"Joel is a very complete player," said Dwyer. "He can play with the ball in his hand or with his feet, can kick for goal and drop them, too, while his tactical kicking is also fine.</p>
<p>"He's got an ability to run with the ball and make decisions as well as play a controlled game if necessary. That's very important.</p>
<p>"What he will bring is a confidence in playing the options that perhaps would have taken more time to develop otherwise."</p>
<p>Stransky looks set to be ruled out of the European Cup semifinal against Toulouse because he was not registered by the start of September. He is likely to make his league debut for the Tigers against Northampton on January 11.</p>
