<p>Germany's DAX index ended bourse trade at a new record closing high on Thursday as the blue-chip index set its sights on breaking 4,000 points in the coming weeks with fresh energy from the stronger dollar.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index ended the session up 32.63 points at 3,887.39 points after earlier reaching a new all-time high at 3,894.66 points.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX, which reflects all-day computer dealings, was up 20.38 points at 3,887.91 points in post-bourse activity.</p>
<p>Traders expected the market to remain steady ahead of the release at 1230 GMT of U.S. jobless data for May as the German market waits for the report's impact on U.S. financial markets ahead of the Independence Day long holiday weekend.</p>
<p>"The market is well-bid and the DAX could very well reach 3,900 today," said one Frankfurt trader. "But investors are going to be cautious, so I expect some more consolidation."</p>
<p>Overnight Wall Street gains, where the Dow Jones index surged about one percent to 7,795.38 points, and the dollar trading above 1.75 marks were the main factors driving the DAX.</p>
<p>The higher dollar was underpinning export-sensitive shares, particularly in the chemical and automotive sectors, as traders said the DAX could break 4,000 points in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>"The ace in the pack is how the U.S. jobs data comes out today," said a Frankfurt share trader.</p>
<p>"The problem, however, is that the market is in blue skies, so it is hard to say where the gains should stop. We could see 4,000 points fairly soon," the trader said.</p>
<p>Chemical shares, which were at the market forefront earlier in the week, were generally lower on profit-taking following recent sharp gains. But traders said the sector was still in vogue and that the uptrend would resume in the near-term.</p>
<p>Hoechst AG, which has risen more than 10 percent since June 25, ended bourse trade down 1.85 marks at 77.45 marks, while rival BASF AG ended down 20 pfennigs at 65.85 marks.</p>
<p>But Bayer AG ended up 40 pfennigs at 71.15 marks.</p>
<p>Bank shares were mixed as Deutche Bank AG fell 1.10 marks to 103.70 marks after setting another new record high at 105.35 marks in pre-bourse IBIS dealings.</p>
<p>Daimler-Benz AG ended up 30 pfennigs at 145.20 marks after also setting a new record high at 146.20 marks in IBIS.</p>
<p>Other carmakers were higher. Volkswagen AG rose 57 marks to 1,402 marks and BMW AG rose 33 marks to 1,457 marks.</p>
<p>Porsche, another top gainer in recent weeks, was up 165 marks at 2,675 marks. Brokerage house Lehman said this week it set a price target for Porsche at 3,600 marks.</p>
