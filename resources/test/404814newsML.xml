<p>Swiss shares posted a record close but ended below the day's highs on Wednesday as early losses on Wall Street sparked by fears of higher U.S  interest rates led to profit taking in late trade.</p>
<p>Volume was very high. Dealers said Novartis, subscription rights for Ciba Specialty Chemicals and UBS were in the limelight. Ciba rights were making their bourse debut.</p>
<p>The outlook depended on the trend on Wall Street, which slumped following U.S. Fed chairman Alan Greenspan's testimony before the U.S. Senate Banking Committee.</p>
<p>The blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) ended up 35.8 points, or 0.79 percent, at 4,539.7 after touching an all-time high at 4,566.0. The previous record close was at 4,530.8 points on February 20.</p>
<p>The all-share Swiss Performance Index (SPI) ended up 15.16 points, or 0.53 percent, to 2,876.68.</p>
<p>Rights for the shares of Ciba Specialty ended their first trading day at 98.05 francs after opening at 100, in line with analysts's forecasts.</p>
<p>They had a high of 105 and a low of 97. Volume was heavy with rights worth of nearly 450 million francs traded. The company is being spun off by Novartis.</p>
<p>Registered shares of Novartis, which were traded ex-rights in Ciba Specialty, were up 16 francs to 1,713.</p>
<p>UBS jumped 27 francs, or more than two percent, to 1,307. Dealers said technical factors may have triggered the rise.</p>
<p>Watchmaker SMH's shares were the day's biggest losers, falling 69 francs, or 7.38 percent, to 866. Traders said 1996 results on Tuesday were clearly below market expectations.</p>
<p>Swiss Re was up one franc at 1,515. The company declined to comment on a newspaper report it was poised to take a 47 stake in French reinsurer SAFR from AGF of France.</p>
