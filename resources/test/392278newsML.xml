<p>Pro-democracy campaigner Martin Lee, chairman of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, said on Thursday he hoped Chinese leaders would take a softer line on Hong Kong following the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>"Now that he is gone, I hope the Chinese leadership can take stock of the whole situation of resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong," Lee told Hong Kong radio from London.</p>
<p>"And that clearly is the time for them to think thrice, as we Chinese say, before implementing any of their recent decisions, which are extremely unpopular with the people of Hong Kong."</p>
<p>He said China's plan to roll back human rights protection laws, emasculate the Bill of Rights Ordinance and establish a provisional legislature was "clearly unconstitutional."</p>
<p>The Democratic Party holds the most seats in Hong Kong's Legislative Council but will see its influence evaporate at midnight on June 30 when Beijing takes back Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Beijing plans to replace the elected chamber with a hand-picked provisional body stocked with pro-China politicians upon the handover, at a stroke undoing democratic reforms spearheaded by Governor Chris Patten.</p>
<p>Beijing also recommended that a number of Hong Kong laws be amended or scrapped after the handover, including provisions in the Bill of Rights.</p>
<p>"For two years now, I think China's policy on Hong Kong has been an extremely hardline one. It may have something to do with the condition of Mr Deng himself because he was obviously too ill to make any decision -- and yet because he remained alive then nobody dared to overturn decisions of his," Lee said.</p>
<p>"China simply wants to control Hong Kong, which is exactly the opposite of what Deng Xiaoping intended in 1984 -- which is, Hong Kong people will be ruling Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy. That means a hands-off policy as opposed to the hands-on policy of today," Lee said.</p>
<p>Some people in Hong Kong would mourn the passing of the Chinese patriarch, Lee said, although others would remember him as "the person behind the crackdown at Tiananmen Square".</p>
<p>"Certainly he made a contribution to China in opening up the economy of the country, but unfortunately he hadn't followed through with bringing in the rule of law, hence you have such pervasive corruption in China."</p>
