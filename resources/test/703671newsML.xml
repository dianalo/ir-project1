<p>Chaos reigned in Thai commercial banks on Wednesday after news of a surprise baht flotation, with tellers refusing to exchange baht for foreign currency.</p>
<p>"It was like mayhem in the bank," said Fiona Buckley, an expatriate who was in a bank to change money for an upcoming trip to Europe.</p>
<p>"The bank was telling people to come back in the afternoon if they wanted to buy foreign currencies," she said.</p>
<p>A teller at Siam Commercial Bank told Reuters the Bank of Thailand had told banks not to sell foreign currency until the afternoon, when it had a clearer idea of the rate. The central bank denied it had issued such instructions.</p>
<p>The government said on Wednesday it would let the battered baht float and was raising its key discount rate by two percentage points to 12.5 percent as part of efforts to restore confidence in the country's exchange system.</p>
<p>The baht weakened sharply on the news, trading at between 27.00/28.00 to the dollar compared with 24.25 earlier. Thai overnight interbank rates were unquoted on Wednesday because banks were unwilling to lend until the market settled.</p>
<p>"This is terrible, I'm going to lose a lot of money," Buckley said, echoing comments made by several other customers who made inquiries at various banks in the morning.</p>
<p>At one bank customers standing in a long queue stood staring in disbelief at a television where Thai financial authorities were explaining their plans to float the baht.</p>
<p>Several said they could barely understand the explanations given in Thai on the television and by bank officials. Others just looked confused and asked each other questions as they were turned away from the counter.</p>
<p>The Bank of Thailand said that from now on, it would set a baht-dollar reference rate daily based on the baht's trading range the day before.</p>
<p>It said it had an "appropriate level" for the baht in mind beyond which it would intervene in the market, but declined to give details.</p>
<p>Bank tellers said there was still confusion over what rate should be used for trading.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange counters, geared mainly towards tourists, were continuing to do business as they are only allowed to sell baht and not other currencies.</p>
<p>"It does not affect us," said a teller at one downtown exchange booth. "But if you want to buy any dollars or anything you have to go into the bank."</p>
