<p>A doctoral candidate at Columbia University, charged with sexually torturing a woman he met over the Internet, has been freed from jail after posting $350,000 bail, officials said Saturday.</p>
<p>Oliver Jovanovic, 30, was freed Thursday evening after having spent a week at the Rikers Island jail while his parents raised the bail money.</p>
<p>Jovanovic's next court appearance was scheduled for Thursday.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Jovanovic was accused of sexually abusing a 20-year-old Barnard College student he met while conversing with her in a "chat room" on the Internet. The woman later met Jovanovic for a dinner date and then agreed to go to his apartment to watch videos.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said that once at the apartment Jovanovic allegedly abused the young woman in 20 hours of bondage during which her legs were tied to a chair. He also allegedly burned her with candle wax and threatened to dismember her before finally letting her go.</p>
<p>Jovanovic has "categorically" denied the charged through his lawyer.</p>
<p>The woman did not go to authorities until two weeks after the Nov. 22 incident and continued to communicate with him over the Internet, authorities said.</p>
