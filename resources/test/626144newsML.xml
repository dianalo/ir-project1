<text>
<p>AUCKLAND, May 30 - Auckland Blues coach Graham Henry is fretting over a most peculiar concern ahead of Saturday's Super 12 rugby final against the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Brumbies at Eden Park -- his team's unbeaten record.</p>
<p>That the Blues are just one match away from an incredible feat in modern rugby is something that Henry should be proud of. Instead he is deeply concerned that it might prove mighty Auckland's achilles heel, the New Zealand Press Association reports.</p>
<p>There is an accepted consensus that the Blues, if they play well for the duration of the match, will do justice to their efforts over the last three months.</p>
<p>But Henry worries that because his team haven't been beaten so far they may be unaware of any flaws -- mental or technical -- within the side that ACT well exploit.</p>
<p>While he may be erring on the side of caution, Henry is well aware that the Brumbies have an astute coach in Rod Macqueen.</p>
<p>The Brumbies are an intelligent side and one which would have spent the week collectively wracking their brains for a little something that could halt the Blues' march to triumph. "We haven't been beaten, and I think being beaten makes you dig a little bit extra physically and I just hope the guys are professional enough to handle that," Henry said.</p>
<p>"There are some advantages in getting beaten, it makes you dig and be more focused than if you go through without a defeat.</p>
<p>"I know these guys know how to come from behind against the likes of New South Wales, but it's not New South Wales that we're playing," he said.</p>
<p>Henry hopes his team have as much respect as he does for the Brumbies because he fears if Auckland don't stretch themselves in seeking the perfect game, all could be lost.</p>
<p>"The ACT are a hell of a lot better side this year than New South Wales," he said.</p>
<p>"I think this is the biggest challenge this Blues side have had. Natal in Durban last year might parallel it but I can't think of another one."</p>
<p>Whether he has genuine reason for concern will only be known on Saturday and Henry seemingly still can't make up his mind whether to be pleased or annoyed by ease with which Auckland put Natal to the sword in their semifinal.</p>
<p>"The message from the way we dropped off last weekend has gotten through but to be leading 45-5 minutes into the second half is just bloody incredible," Henry said.</p>
<p>His anxiety has been given substance by Macqueen, who has come to Auckland believing he has the psychological weapon to dismantle the Blues -- respect.</p>
<p>"They probably haven't played as well as they can," Macqueen said, pointing out Auckland deserve to be treated with caution.</p>
<p>"But in not playing as well as they can they have still won all their games convincingly well and that is a little ominous from our point of view."</p>
<p>"We respect Auckland greatly, but something that comes to mind from our point of view is the difference between arrogance and confidence," he said.</p>
<p>"We're a very confident team. I think the difference is that an arrogant team doesn't respect the opposition.</p>
<p>"We certainly respect the opposition. We think Auckland are a great team but we're confident, and we'll go out believing we will do well and we will play positive football.</p>
<p>"We believe we can play better. We made uncharacteristic errors against Wellington last week and we'll be looking at improving on that," he said.</p>
<p>The Blues' only advantage going into tomorrow's final is that they will have a crowd of close to 45,000 backing them on their own turf at Eden Park.</p>
<p>Teams:</p>
<p>Auckland Blues - Adrian Cashmore; Joeli Vidiri, Eroni Clarke, Brian Lima, Lee Stensness; Carlos Spencer, Ofisa Tonu'u; Zinzan Brooke (captain), Mark Carter, Robin Brooke, Leo Lafaiali'i, Michael Jones, Olo Brown, Sean Fitzpatrick, Craig Dowd.</p>
<p>ACT Brumbies - Stephen Larkham; Mitch Hardy, James Holbeck, Pat Howard, Joe Roff; David Knox, George Gregan; Troy Coker, Brett Robinson (captain), David Giffin, John Langford, Owen Finnegan, Ewen McKenzie, Marco Caputo, Patricio Noriega.</p>
