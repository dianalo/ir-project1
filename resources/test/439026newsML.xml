<p>South Africa's largest trade union grouping said on Thursday that the 1997/1998 budget did not do enough to promote job creation and the government was taking a gamble on relaxing foreign exchange controls.</p>
<p>However, Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) secretary general Sam Shilowa told state radio that he welcomed the tax relief for workers, plans to cut the defense budget and the decision not to increase VAT.</p>
<p>Shilowa said Finance Minister Trevor Manuel's maiden budget paid too much attention to trying to please the markets and not enough to the needs of ordinaray workers and the poor.</p>
<p>"It's a budget that in the main is put together to please international investors," he said.</p>
<p>"It's too easy to say there is more money for social spending. But if you look at it in real terms we would argue there has been a cut in social spending."</p>
<p>Manuel was wrong to focus on cutting the deficit at all costs and should rather have aimed to boost overall economic growth, Shilowa said.</p>
<p>The move to relax exchange controls on individuals and businesses risked triggering an outflow of capital which remained in the country to fund domestic investment.</p>
