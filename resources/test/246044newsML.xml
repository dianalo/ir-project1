<p>Daiwa Europe Ltd said it expected the BUX index of the Budapest Stock Exchange to close at 3,900 points at the end of 1996 and to rise further during 1997.</p>
<p>"Our year-end target for the BUX Index is 3,900, which would bring the market to a price/earnings ratio of 13 times for 1996, but a more reasonable (and much more relevant) 10.5 times for 1997," Daiwa said in its December report.</p>
<p>On December 9 the BUX index closed at 3,754.25 points.</p>
<p>The securities house was bullish on the Budapest bourse, which has been a strong performer in 1996 with a more than 100 percent rise in dollar terms. It said it has raised the proportion of Hungarian stocks within its regional portfolio.</p>
<p>"We have raised our regional allocation to 15 percent (from six percent) and our target for the BUX index for year-end 1997 is 4,500 to 4,800," the report said.</p>
<p>"This market has moved up to new records while Bratislava and Prague have slumped, but we still believe valuation and fundamentals favour Budapest," the report said.</p>
<p>It added, however that it would not rate Budapest's potential as highly as that of Russia.</p>
<p>The securities house was bullish on Hungary on the grounds of expectations of gradually falling interest rates and continuing flow of portfolio funds.</p>
