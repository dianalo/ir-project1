<title>UK: Euro LPG supported by maintenance, Asia trade slow.</title>
<headline>Euro LPG supported by maintenance, Asia trade slow.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-07-25</dateline>

<p>Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) prices ended the week stable in NWE as maintenance kept supplies tight, dealers said, but Middle Eastern and East Asian prices remained depressed as buying interest has yet to emerge.</p>
<p>In Europe a 20,000 tonne cargo of Algerian propane was reported sold at around $190 a tonne cif ARA in the middle of the week. The exact price was not confirmed and there were rumoured to be some options on discharge which had an impact on the price.</p>
<p>But dealers said the market was pegged in the range $188/$192 a tonne cif NWE following this trade.</p>
<p>A trader speculated that the seller of this cargo would like to sell cargoes of 40,000 tonnes into Europe, but there were not many buyers there capable of taking such a large volume.</p>
<p>NWE LPG has remained firm partly because of reduced supply from Norway's Karsto terminal. The giant Sleipner gas field, which supplies LPG to Karsto, will be undergoing maintenance from August 7-19.</p>
<p>Although Karsto will be open for the whole period, average throughputs over of August will be reduced by 30 percent.</p>
<p>Butane in northwest Europe was still valued around $170 a tonne cif NWE but was extremely quiet with no trade seen.  </p>
<p>But while European propane remained relatively strong, demand for both propane and butane in East Asia remained sluggish, a Japanese trader said.</p>
<p>"It's not so clear, the market is losing direction," he said.</p>
<p>Bearish factors includeD the possibility the August Saudi Contract Price (CP), the benchmark against which most LPG in Asia is traded, would be below the current July level.</p>
<p>The main bullish factor is an Indian LPG tender which is giving some support to prices at a traditionally slow time of year.</p>
<p>Japanese inventory levels are normal for this time of year and stock levels in South Korea are also high.</p>
<p>As a result "Japanese buyers don't feel any need to be in a hurry," the trader said.</p>
<p>Japanese buyers traditionally wait until prices reach the lowest level of the summer before stocking up for the coming winter. But there is often a stand-off at this stage of the summer as traders try to guess when prices will bottom out.</p>
<p>If the August CP is above the July level, the Japanese trader said, Japanese buyers are expected to start entering the market and will force the price up.</p>
<p>But if it is lower than July, or at parity, some may hold out until September and await the chance that September's level will be no higher than August, he said.</p>
<p>Discounts to the CP in the Mideast Gulf remained low, with propane talked at CP - $15/$10 a tonne on an fob basis.</p>
<p>There was talk that a cargo had traded recently at CP - $20 a tonne, but this was no longer seen as repeatable, a dealer said.</p>
<p>Butane was slightly stronger, discussed at around CP -$5 or -$7 a tonne, he added.</p>
