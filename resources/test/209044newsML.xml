<p>The buildings housing the European Court of Justice will have to be gutted and refurbished because high levels of asbestos have been found in the air inside, a spokesman for the ministry of public works said on Friday.</p>
<p>"The decontamination works alone will cost several million dollars," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The buildings were opened in 1972 when asbestos was in common use as an insulating material.</p>
<p>The European Commission's headquarters in Brussels was evacuated for the same reason in 1991. It currently stands shrouded in white plastic to avoid asbestos particles escaping into the surrounding atmosphere as workers rip it apart.</p>
<p>Evacuation of the 1,000 or so judges, assistants, clerks and support staff who occupy the court buildings in Luxembourg will take place in three or four months. Meanwhile the government is searching for somewhere else to house them.</p>
