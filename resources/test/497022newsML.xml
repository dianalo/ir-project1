<p>CME lumber futures closed up the daily limit of $10.00 per thousand board feet for the second straight day on buy stops and posted new contract highs as rising cash lumber prices sparked further short covering and new buying, traders said.</p>
<p>May and July ended limit up at new highs with May at $401.60 per tbf and July at $397.40. Other months finished $7.30 higher to $0.50 lower with only distant January off.</p>
<p>Reports that cash lumber was trading over $400 along with the discount of futures to cash sparked further demand. Futures also broke through a trend line on the weekly charts which prompted technical buying, they said.</p>
<p>Random Lengths early Wednesday quoted cash spruce at $394 per tbf, up $4 from Friday and $11 above the week-ago quote. But most traders said cash lumber is trading even higher, in the $400- to $405-area.</p>
<p>"It appears that the improvement in the weather is having a little bigger impact on retail demand than most people anticipated," said Neil Schmaedick, Smith Barney Forest Products analyst.</p>
<p>"Mills are back in control with two- to three-week order files," Schmaedick added.</p>
<p>Dean Witter, Cargill Investor Services and Prudential Securities were buyers on the early advance, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Futures will have a $15.00 trading limit Thursday following limit gains two days in a row, in the May contract.</p>
<p>Futures were seen opening sharply higher, based on options. The May option closed synthetically at $409.60, traders added.</p>
