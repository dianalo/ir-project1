<p>Hong Kong police will step up security at a soccer match between Japanese and Hong Kong sides on Sunday because of a dispute over islands in the East China Sea, Hong Kong's TVB news said on Thursday.</p>
<p>TVB news quoted a senior officer as saying police would increase manpower at the Hong Kong stadium to prevent a possible flare-up of violence between Japanese and Hong Kong fans.</p>
<p>The officer also said they would segregate fans from the two sides.</p>
<p>Hong Kong police officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Hong Kong's South China club and Japan's Grampus Eight meet on Sunday in the Asian Cup Winners' Cup.</p>
<p>Anti-Japanese sentiment in Hong Kong has flared in recent months after Japanese extremists erected a lighthouse and flags on the disputed islands, which Japan calls the Senkakus and which China claims as the Diaoyu isles.</p>
<p>Tension reached a new high last week when Hong Kong protest leader David Chan drowned after jumping off a ship in the area.</p>
<p>Japan has claimed the territory, a cluster of uninhabited rocky islets, since 1895. China has claimed them for centuries. Taiwan also lays claim to the territory.</p>
