<p>Saudi Arabia's minister of labour told private companies to meet a November 11 deadline to increase the number of nationals on their staff by five percent or face sanctions, Saudi newspapers said on Sunday.</p>
<p>"All private sector firms should achieve at least this minimum target by November 11," they quoted Mousaed al-Sinani as saying. He added that a ministry committee will check and violators will be punished.</p>
<p>The move is in line with a 1995-2000 development plan, which set a target of creating 659,900 jobs for Saudis by the end of the century. Some 319,500 expatriate workers are to be gradually replaced by Saudi citizens.</p>
<p>About five million expatriates work in Saudi Arabia, which has a population of about 17 million. Fewer than seven percent of private sector employees are Saudi, economists and bankers say.</p>
<p>Riyadh earlier this month banned expatriates from 14 job categories and said existing work permits for the prohibited professions will not be renewed. It also ordered that work permits for 14 other jobs be limited to one year instead of the current two.</p>
<p>The banned jobs range from personnel manager, personnel administrator, treasurer, auctioneer and customs clearance officer to secretaries, messengers and security guards.</p>
