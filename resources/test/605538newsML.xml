<p>The troubled Citadel, which has been racked by allegations of sexual harassment and glorification of Nazi symbols, agreed on a blueprint with the government Thursday for enrolling more women cadets at the publicly funded military school.</p>
<p>The two sides reached the agreement after hours of talks during a hearing here under U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck.</p>
<p>The academy says it hopes to enroll at least 20 women in the fall of this year.</p>
<p>Among the most significant new features of the plan were the creation of posts for a female dean of women, a woman recruitment officer and a woman assistant commandant of cadets, lawyers said.</p>
<p>The school would also accept permanent outside consultation to assist it in all aspects of co-education, more detailed leadership, sexual harassment and medical training, the creation of a confidential ombudsman's post, and more detailed policies on recruitment of women students and athletes.</p>
<p>The hearing was called by the government in reaction to allegations of hazing by two women cadets who enrolled at The Citadel last year.</p>
<p>The South Carolina school, which waged a lengthy legal fight against co-education, has been the subject of scrutiny since December, when the two women withdrew and alleged they had been subjected to physical abuse and sexual harassment. They had been among the first women to enter the academy.</p>
<p>Fourteen male cadets were punished in the wake of the allegations, including two who were dismissed and three who resigned.</p>
<p>Officials at The Citadel said Tuesday the college had punished one cadet during the past academic year for displaying what appeared to be a swastika on a piece of cardboard.</p>
