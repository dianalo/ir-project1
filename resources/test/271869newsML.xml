<p>An earthquake rocked Srinagar, the summer capital of India's Jammu and Kashmir state on Saturday, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.</p>
<p>The news agency said the tremor, which occurred at 8.00 p.m. (1430 GMT), rattled windows and drove people out onto the streets.</p>
<p>PTI described the tremor as mild although seismology officials could not be immediately reached for further details.</p>
<p>In 1993, a quake of 6.4 on the Richter scale devastated a large area of neighbouring Maharashtra state, killing more than 11,000 people, and leaving about 150,000 homeless.</p>
