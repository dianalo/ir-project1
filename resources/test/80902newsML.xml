<headline>U.S. OPTIONS FOCUS/Index call buying draws caution.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-09-27</dateline>

<p>Options analysts are cautious on the stock market's near-term upside potential, with several noting recently high index call buying.</p>
<p>"The background seems to be pretty positive, but it's the end of the quarter and it looks like people are a little reluctant to sell puts here," said Marty Kearney at PTI Securities in Chicago.</p>
<p>"At some point we're going to correct a little bit, but right now we just sit and wait," he said, adding that a slew of economic data next week would likely keep many investors at least on edge and at most on the sidelines.  </p>
<p>On Monday, the September Chicago purchasing managers report and August new home sales data are due, followed by August leading economic indicators on Tuesday. On Friday, the September employment report is due.</p>
<p>Jerry Hegarty, an analyst at Thomson Research, said in a report Friday that recently heavy call activity lessened the chances that the market would be able to move higher over the very near term.</p>
<p>He said the historical norm is for 70 equity puts to trade for every 100 calls, for a 0.70 reading, but that recently the readings have been in the 0.48 to 0.63 region.  </p>
<p>"These are signs of excessive speculation," Hegarty said. "I would like to see those readings begin to jump in order to have complete faith in a solid up-move."</p>
<p>He added that a sharp 1-1/2- to two-day selloff would likely induce heavy put buying, which would be "very" bullish.</p>
<p>"The market still wants to go higher but in order for us to generate a reliable buy signal we need to see put buying increase versus call buying," he said.</p>
<p>At 1100 CDT (1600 GMT), index put volume was outpacing put volume on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. Overall index put volume totalled 56,416 compared to index call volume of 42,208.  </p>
<p>The key Dow industrial average was down about 14 points at 5,855.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 stock index .SPX was off about a point at 684.84 and the S&amp;P 100 .OEX was off 1.65 at 659.93.</p>
<p>The most active individual SPX index options were the November 600 call and put and the November 650 call and put in what traders said was a box put on by an institution.</p>
<p>The SPX November 650 put traded 6,658 contracts. Its open interest, boosted by an addition of nearly 5,500 on Thursday, was 9,344.  </p>
<p>The SPX November 600 call traded 6,000 times and the November 650 call traded about 5,650 times. The November 600 put option traded 5,000.</p>
<p>Those four options traded roughly the same volume on Thursday, and traders said the investor could have been exiting the position.</p>
<p>In the OEX, the October 660 put was the most active, with more than 5,800 contracts traded. The option's open interest was about 15,400. Behind that was the OEX October 650 put, with nearly 5,500 contracts traded. Its open interest was 22,120. --Gregory Crawford, 312-408-8750/E-mail: derivatives@reuters.com</p>
