<headline>Congressman vows to block airline ticket tax.</headline>

<p>A Republican Congressman from Tennessee said Monday he would try to block passage of a bill reimposing a 10 percent airline ticket tax when the House acts on the legislation Tuesday.</p>
<p>The ticket tax expired Dec. 31. The bill reinstates the tax until Sept. 30, the end of the government's fiscal year.</p>
<p>Rep. Van Hilleary said he would oppose the bill unless it included offsetting tax cuts. "As a conservative, I am philosophically opposed to increasing the burden on American taxpayers, and this airline ticket tax bill, as it is now written, would definitely increase the tax burden," he said.</p>
<p>The bill will be acted on under procedures that prohibit amendments and require a two-thirds majority for passage. Hilleary said he would ask for a roll call vote, rather than let the bill pass by voice vote. If a roll call is ordered, it would take place Wednesday.</p>
<p>Money from the airline ticket tax is used for the airport and airways trust fund, which pays for airport and air traffic control system improvements. Treasury and transportation department officials have warned that the fund may run out of money in March unless the tax is reimposed.</p>
<p>Several major airlines say the tax is unfairly applied and have asked Congress to replace it with user fees.</p>
