<headline>NY precious metals end sharply lower for 4th day.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-01-06</dateline>

<p>New York precious metals futures ended sharply lower for the fourth session in a row Monday, with spot gold prices down more than $10.00 an ounce or 2.8 percent in the first three trading days of the year.</p>
<p>"The renewed fall in gold prices in the past few days has again been driven by proprietary trading in the commodity funds and banks, against a background of very weak physical investment demand in gold bullion and coins, while most world stock markets and the US dollar stay strong," industry consultant Jeffrey Christian of CPM Group said.  </p>
<p>COMEX February gold closed down $3.30 an ounce at $358.70, after seeing a new life-of-contract low at $357.60.</p>
<p>COMEX gold futures estimated volume was a solid 40,000 lots Monday, and open interest for Friday, reported early Monday, rose a further 3,890 lots, suggesting fund net short positions are rising again, analysts said.</p>
<p>Spot gold in the bullion market ended quoted $357.50/358.00, after gold fixed at $358.50 an ounce in London Monday afternoon, the lowest fix since October 7, 1993. Gold closed in New York Friday quoted $360.75/361.25.</p>
<p>Short-term implied gold lease rates have risen sharply in the past two days, with the one month rate up to 2.14 percent Monday, from below 1.50 percent at the end of 1996, suggesting aggressive shorting as traders borrow gold in the physical market in back their short positions, traders said.</p>
<p>"While there have been concerns about European central banks last year, I would discount rumors of official or producer selling behind the latest down move," Christian said.</p>
<p>"Jewellry demand has held up pretty well over Christmas and in the Far East but, with inflation low, investment demand is at its lowest level since the 1970's," he said.</p>
<p>Market rumors in recent weeks have noted much of the selling has been through two bullion banks in particular and pointed to a central bank sale.</p>
<p>The Bank of Italy is the only major European central bank that has failed to deny it was selling gold to meet the criteria for European monetary union under the Maastricht Treaty, analysts said.</p>
<p>But central bank sales are still estimated to be around 200 tonnes for the 1996 year, compared to around 232 tonnes in 1995 and 80 tonnes in 1994, analysts said.</p>
<p>"The situation looks a bit like 1993 when there was heavy speculative short selling that took gold prices down to about $340 an ounce, before short covering and solid physical demand pushed prices back up to over $400," World Gold Council consultant George Milling Stanley said.</p>
<p>"Net short open interest by funds reached a record around 60,000 contracts or 200 tonnes late in 1996, before some pre-Christmas short covering occurred, but the latest CFTC Commitment of Traders data, due late Monday, may show it rising again," he said.</p>
<p>"Physical demand, which was down three percent in the first nine months of 1996, according to World Gold Council data, looks like it has recovered some ground near year end though," he said.</p>
<p>Gold has been weaker than silver in the past few days, with the spot gold/silver ratio slipping back to 77.23 by the close from 77.53 at last Thursday's close.</p>
<p>COMEX March silver ended down 3.3 cent at $4.652 an ounce, after a new contract low was seen at $4.635.</p>
<p>NYMEX April platinum closed down $3.00 at $364.90 an ounce, after seeing a new contract low at $363.20, with all deliveries out to January 1998 seeing contract lows also.</p>
<p>NYMEX March palladium ended down 65 cents at $121.10.</p>
