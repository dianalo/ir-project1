<p>Shopping centre operator Westfield Trust said it will acquire the Galleria shopping centre in Perth from joint vendors, retailer Coles Myer Ltd and life office Colonial Mutual, for A$289 million.</p>
<p>The 66,000-square metre centre, situated on 21 hectares in Perth's north-east, comprises a Myer department store, Kmart and Target discount department stores, Coles and Woolworths Ltd supermarkets, a Greater Union cinema multiplex, 180 specialty stores and parking for 3,900 cars, it said.</p>
<p>The Galleria will be acquired with a purchase yield of 7.5 percent, Westfield said.  </p>
<p>This reflects the centre's strong investment quality and its above average future growth potential, Westfield's executive director Steven Lowy said in a statement.</p>
<p>The acquisition will be funded by borrowings and is expected to be distribution neutral for the first year of ownership by the trust, he said.</p>
<p>Thereafter the income growth anticipated will result in an increasing positive impact on unitholders' distributions.</p>
<p>The purchase will increase the Trust's total assets to A$3.6 billion with interests in 26 shopping centres and result in a gearing ratio of 17 percent.  </p>
<p>Lowy said he reaffirmed the trust's recent forecast that, in the absence of unforeseen circumstances, the distribution per unit for the first half of 1996 should at least be maintained in the second half.</p>
