<p>Pakistani stocks surged in kerb trading on Tuesday after President Farooq Leghari sacked Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and named a caretaker premier.</p>
<p>Dealers said investors had flocked to the parking lot of the Karachi Stock Exchange, which was closed because of a religious holiday, and were engaged in frantic trading.</p>
<p>"I can see 400 to 500 people shouting their offers and bids in the parking lot," dealer Salman Ahmed said. Far more people were trading than normally appear on the floor of the exchange.</p>
<p>Sameer Ahmed, head of sales at ING Baring Securities said the kerb market had burst into life and prices being quoted signalled that the market would open sharply up on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"As the price in kerb will be reflected in Wednesday's trading we can safely say it will be a bull run," Ahmed said.</p>
<p>Salman said the reaction showed most investors and players were happy with the abrupt change in government. "They hope the new caretaker set-up will take care of corruption, mismanagement and the law and order situation," he said.</p>
<p>Sameer said Hub Power Co was quoted at 37.50 rupees against Monday's close of 35.40, Dewan Salman Fibre had jumped to 40 from 38.40 and Fauji Fertilizer had risen to 84.50 from 81.25.  </p>
<p>Analyst Aliya Dosa at Crosby Securities said the market was likely to gain at least 100 points in the next two days before pausing for breath.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Karachi 100-share index rose 40.81 points, or 2.80 percent, to end at 1,499.97. Shares soared on blue-chip buying powered by a rise in synthetic fibre prices and some favourable corporate results.</p>
