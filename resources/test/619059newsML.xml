<p>Sri Lankan blue chip conglomerate John Keells Holdings Ltd, which announced a sharp rise in profit for 1996-97 (April/March), said on Tuesday it aims to increase investments in plantations and infrastructure projects.</p>
<p>The company said on Monday its net profit after tax rose by 27 percent to 421 million rupees ($7.2 million) on turnover of 5.72 billion rupees, mainly on improved revenues from its tea plus food and beverages businesses.</p>
<p>"The group's performance reached an all time high due to plantations and Ceylon Cold Stores in the food and beverage sector doing amazingly well," Ken Balendra, chairman of John Keells Holdings (JKH), told Reuters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ceylon Cold Stores controls a large share of the local processed meat and soft drinks markets.</p>
<p>Balendra said the group's future lies in expanding aggressively in the areas like power, telecommunications, roads and port development.</p>
<p>"John Keells' activities mirror the economy of the country. A developing country like Sri Lanka needs to urgently develop its infrastructure and the government, recognising this, has called upon the private sector to play its part," he said.</p>
<p>The group's first foray into infrastructure development came through South Asia Gateway Terminals (Pvt) Ltd, a joint venture with P&amp;O Ports Australia and Nedlloyd, to refurbish and expand the Queen Elizabeth quay at Colombo port.</p>
<p>"Negotiations with the government are at the final stage and development work will commence during the year," Balendra said.</p>
<p>JKH is also investing $2 million in a power project through Asia Power (Pvt) Ltd, a joint venture with KHD Great Britain, a unit of Germany's Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG, to build a 51 megawatt thermal power plant.</p>
<p>"Infrastructure investments are vital for the group's future, but that does not mean that we will not go into any other areas we feel are strategic," Balendra said.</p>
<p>The group, which already has holdings in Kegalle Plantations Ltd, Tea Smallholder Factories Ltd and the yet to be listed Maskeliya Plantations Ltd, will further expand its exposure to the sector, Balendra said.</p>
<p>"There are plans to invest 100 million rupees to build a modern tea factory for Tea Smallholders and we are also looking at value additions for both tea and rubber in the other firms."</p>
<p>"Food and beverage is also another area which we will not neglect, given the fact that Ceylon Cold Stores and the plantation sector accounted for most of the group's profit," Balendra said.</p>
<p>JKH has invested 280 million rupees on a new bottling plant for Cold Stores, which produces local brands of soft drinks.</p>
<p>Hotels and leisure, once a major contributor to group profits, saw an indifferent year in 1996/1997 due to rebel attacks in the capital Colombo, analysts said.</p>
<p>"But here too, we have turned the corner, and if things stay as they are, the sector should be profitable in 1997/1998."</p>
<p>The group, which owns and manages 11 hotels, is the largest tour operator into Sri Lanka.</p>
