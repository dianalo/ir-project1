<p>Barring a dramatic turnaround in the polls, Mr. Smith will not be going to Washington this year -- at least not as a U.S. Senator from Texas.</p>
<p>Victor Morales, a high school civics teacher who ran for the Senate on a dare from his students, is faltering badly in his race to unseat Republican incumbent Sen. Phil Gramm. Polls shows Morales trailing Gramm by as much as 15 percent with less than a month to go before the Nov. 5 election.</p>
<p>His improbable victory in last spring's Texas Democratic primary prompted comparisons with the classic movie "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" in which an average citizen played by Jimmy Stewart becomes a senator. Morales spent less than $50,000 and campaigned out of his family's pickup truck.</p>
<p>But the Morales-Gramm race has been an object lesson in what happens when a political novice with little money runs against a well-funded veteran campaigner. Gramm has so outflanked Morales that the Democratic Party has thus far backed away from promises to give him campaign money, preferring instead to spend its cash on winnable races.</p>
<p>"The only way Mr. Smith now goes to Congress is with his high school students on a field trip. Victor Morales is not going to the U.S. Senate," Rice University political scientist Bob Stein said.</p>
<p>In television and radio ads, Gramm has pounded away at Morales as just another Democratic liberal. "Victor Morales stands with the liberals in Washington. Phil Gramm stands with us," says a narrator in a Gramm radio spot.</p>
<p>But Morales has sometimes been his own worst enemy. He refused a September television debate with Gramm because he said it should be held closer to the election, and Gramm's campaign scored points by sending someone in a duck costume to Morales appearances to accuse him of "ducking" the debate.</p>
<p>Then Morales angered many voters by calling Republican U.S. Representative Henry Bonilla, a Hispanic from San Antonio, Texas, a "wannabe white."</p>
<p>"Where I grew up we called them coconuts, white on the inside, brown on the outside," Morales said. The comment alienated white voters and insulted many Hispanics, who were his biggest supporters in the Democratic primary, Stein said.</p>
<p>Gramm, who made an unsuccessful run for the Republican presidential nomination, called the comments "mean-spirited." Even the White House described the remarks as "inappropriate."</p>
<p>But Morales remains undaunted. He continues to drive around the state in his truck to campaign appearances and says that, with a little more money, a win would be assured.</p>
<p>"We're right on the edge. That's why it's frustrating not having the money to go on television because I know that would be the final nail in the coffin (for Gramm)," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He had about $300,000 on hand at the end of September, most of it from small contributions. Gramm, who had $3.4 million in his war chest early in the summer, told supporters in a letter it would take $12 million to run against Morales.</p>
<p>Morales has staked out a moderately liberal stance on the issues but admits that he does not know enough about complex problems such as funding for Social Security to suggest a solution. He says voters see his candor as a refreshing change from politics as usual, but Gramm believes it simply indicates that Morales is not fit to be a senator.</p>
<p>"I believe (someday) we will elect a Hispanic senator and a Hispanic governor (in Texas). It won't be Victor Morales. It will be someone qualified for the job," Gramm told the Houston Chronicle newspaper.</p>
