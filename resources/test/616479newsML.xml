<p>The head of Chile's state copper mining company Codelco said on Tuesday he had not been informed of government plans to bring his firm into a joint venture with state smelting company Enami at its Ventanas plant.</p>
<p>Asked by reporters about comments by Mining Minister Benjamin Teplizky on Friday that the government was planning for Codelco to help modernize the Ventanas smelter and refinery, Codelco executive president Marcos Lima said that he was unaware of the project.  </p>
<p>"I have not received any official information either from the minister or from anyone," Lima said.</p>
<p>But he added, "Obviously as we have in the area a mine like Andina, which produces concentrates, and a mine like Teniente, which produces anodes, it would not displease us to vertically integrate with a smelter and refinery."</p>
<p>Teplizky also said last week Enami could expand its Paipote smelter in a joint venture with small miners, aided by funds from smelter workers' retirement and compensation funds.</p>
<p>Codelco is vastly profitable and has earned the state $20 billion over the past 10 years. But Enami, which is less profitable, needs to make big investments to bring its facilities up to date.</p>
