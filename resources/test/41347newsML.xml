<p>Dark northern spring wheat cash bids were mixed on Monday in subdued dealings, dealers said.</p>
<p>December MGE spring wheat futures gained 1-1/2 cent to end at $4.30-3/4 a bushel.</p>
<p>Movement was very slow. "It was an extremely quiet day," a Minneapolis dealer said. Farmers are still waiting for higher prices. But it does not look like they will get that for quite a while."</p>
<p>An Oregon dealer concurred that activity was lackluster. "We are waiting for export activity," he said.  </p>
