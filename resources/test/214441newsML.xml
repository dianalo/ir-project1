<headline>Industries, health advocates spar over air proposal.</headline>

<p>With federal regulators expected this week to propose stricter air quality standards, health advocates and industry groups Monday accused each other of trying to deceive the public on dangers posed by air pollution.</p>
<p>"America's polluting industries have launched a multi-million dollar war on the truth," David Hawkins, of the Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC), said at a news conference in which health experts said thousands of people were suffering from asthma and other lung ailments under current air standards.</p>
<p>But a coalition of industry groups, including the American Petroleum Institute and the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, said  in a statement that the Environmental Protection Agency's "imminent, unjustified proposal to tighten the ozone and particulate matter air quality standards will force the nation to make huge investments in air pollution controls that will do little to improve public health."</p>
<p>The EPA is expected to propose stricter standards against smog-forming ozone pollution and tiny particles that may lodge in the lungs. Agency officials said they hoped to announce the plan Tuesday.</p>
<p>With a final ruling on the air standards to be issued in June, industry and health groups expected a long and costly fight over the issue, in which billions of dollars are at stake.</p>
<p>The American Lung Association and the NRDC in their news conference cited studies that showed ozone levels that meet current standards reduce human lung function and that fine air particles contribute to premature deaths.</p>
<p>But industries said in their statement claims that ozone increases asthma were "contradicted by scientific studies which instead stress the roles of indoor air pollution, passive tobacco smoke, allergens and poor prenatal care."</p>
<p>The industry statement also said "science has yet to establish any direct linkage between small particle exposure and increased mortality rates."</p>
<p>Industries and health advocates also clashed over how stricter standards would affect the public's wallets and lifestyles.</p>
<p>"Americans will pay billions of dollars for new air pollution controls that wil change the way they live. They'll pay more for cars, gasoline and electricity, drive less, get their vehicles inspected more often and could face limits on use of fireplaces, lawnmowers, wood stoves, boats and barbeque grills," the industry statement said.</p>
<p>"They gin up a $2 million war chest to say that somebody else is going to have to do something" to reduce air pollution instead of acknowledging the industries "would have to clean up their own pollution," said Hawkins of the NRDC.</p>
<p>Hawkins said the economic effects of stricter ozone and particulate rules would be "entirely manageable," and said reduced health care costs would help offset expenditures.</p>
