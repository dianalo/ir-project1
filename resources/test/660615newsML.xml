<p>France and Germany share broadly similar views on Europe and are confident of bridging any differences on a budget pact in time for a European Union summit in Amsterdam next week, French President Jacques Chirac said after a Franco-German summit on Friday.</p>
<p>"We discussed...the problems raised by social issues which complement the economic aspects of the (European Union) stability and growth pact, and there is every reason to believe there will be a solution in Amsterdam," Chirac said after the one-day talks with German chancellor Helmut Kohl.</p>
<p>"We observed that our views are very largely similar and wherever this is not the case a solution can easily be found."</p>
<p>He added that he and Kohl had also discussed preparations for a new EU intergovernmental treaty and bilateral issues.</p>
