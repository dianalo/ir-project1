<p>Indonesian tyre-grade March SIR20 offer prices were easier in late trading on Friday because buyers believed prices were quoted too high, traders said.</p>
<p>They said no fresh deals were heard in the market as buyers seemed to waiting for a further easing in prices.</p>
<p>The SIR20 March price was quoted at 54.50 U.S. cents/lb fob Medan, Surabaya and Palembang, down from the morning's levels of 54.625. U.S. cents/lb. In Padang, offer prices were unchanged at 54.25, while in Pontianak and Jambi traders offered SIR20 at 53.75 U.S. cents/lb, down from the morning's price of 53.875 U.S. cents/lb.  </p>
<p>"The problem is that traders have been too stubborn in that they keep increasing the offer prices, while in fact there are not so many buyers coming to the market," said one trader.</p>
<p>"Buyers seem to wish to wait until prices decline further," he added.</p>
<p>Traders said they might give up selling at 54.00 U.S. cents/lb otherwise prices would keep going down.</p>
<p>"There is always a trend in the market that once the price falls, it will continue that way," said another trader.</p>
<p>Traders said supply was still tight because farmers had yet to return to work after the Eid al-Fitr celebration.  </p>
<p>Traders earlier said they expected more buyers to enter the market next week as they needed to fill their stocks for March, April and May.</p>
<p>They also said there had been some sporadic buying from European and U.S. buyers, but orders only reached between 100 and 200 tonnes. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364</p>
