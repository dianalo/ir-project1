<p>India might appeal to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to intervene if the European Commission (EC) imposed an anti-dumping duty on grey cotton fabric imports, government officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We are thinking about it (taking the issue to the WTO)," a senior Indian Textiles Ministry official who asked not to be identified told Reuters.</p>
<p>The EC last week reopened inquiries over alleged dumping of grey cotton fabric by China, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Pakistan and Turkey after a complaint by Eurocoton, the Committee of the Cotton and allied Textile Industries of the European Union.</p>
<p>The issue was closed in May when a majority of EU trade ministers rejected the Commission's case for setting definitive dumping duties against the same six countries.</p>
<p>An Indian Commerce Ministry spokeswoman told Reuters that there were indications the duty on grey cotton fabric might be revived. "India's stance is that it is unfair," she said.</p>
<p>A senior official at the state-run Cotton Textiles Export Promotion Council told Reuters: "We are going to defend our case."</p>
<p>The official said that the EC, soon after dropping the move to impose anti-dumping duty on grey cotton fabric in May, imposed a duty ranging from 3.9 to 27.3 percent on bed linen imports from India.</p>
<p>Indian Commerce Minister B.B. Ramaiah told a meeting of parliamentary deputies on Monday that the move to impose the anti-dumping duty on grey cotton in addition to the duty on bed linen would adversely affect India's textile exports.</p>
<p>A senior Textiles Ministry official said that the country's exports would certainly be affected but the extent depended on the percentage of duty.</p>
