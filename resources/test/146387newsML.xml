<p>The U.N. criminal tribunal for ex-Yugoslavia forges ahead with its mission on Monday amid fears its credibility may have been undermined by the unmasking as a fraud of a key prosecution witness in its first war crimes trial.</p>
<p>United Nations prosecutors in the trial of alleged Bosnian Serb war criminal Dusan Tadic on Friday withdrew the testimony of Dragan Opacic after a U.N. investigator told the court Opacic had been forced by Bosnian military police to give false evidence.</p>
<p>"If (Opacic's) testimony is false, then the tribunal has deteriorated into an instrument in the propaganda war being waged against each other by the three parties in former Yugoslavia," defence counsel Michail Wladimiroff told Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad at the weekend.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Dutch foreign office earlier described the revelations as "worrying".</p>
<p>But the prosecutor's office said in a statement that Opacic's exposure as a fraud showed the tribunal's procedures were working effectively.</p>
<p>"The exposition of the untruthfulness of a witness does not undermine the process: it vindicates it," the statement said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said previously they had doubts about Opacic's testimony after he appeared in closed session in August.</p>
<p>Identified then only as witness "L", Opacic said he had been a guard at the Serb-run camp of Trnopolje in northwest Bosnia, where he saw Tadic commit atrocities.</p>
<p>The prosecution said that as a result it was dropping a charge relating to Tadic's alleged activities at Trnopolje.</p>
<p>Tadic, who returns to the witness stand on Monday, still faces 30 counts of committing atrocities at the Serb-run Omarska and Keraterm concentration camps.</p>
<p>The Opacic affair highlights the problems of witness reliability raised by the defence throughout Tadic's trial, the first in a long series planned by the tribunal.</p>
<p>Wladimiroff and fellow defence counsel Stephen Kay have repeatedly suggested during cross examination that Muslim witnesses were driven by a hatred of Serbs to lie against Tadic, or that, traumatised, they had confused media coverage with having seen Tadic in real life.</p>
<p>Summing up in the Tadic trial, which started in May, is set to begin on November 25 with a verdict expected in the spring.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the tribunal has set starting dates for two more trials.</p>
<p>Bosnian Croat Drazen Erdemovic, who earlier pleaded guilty to helping shoot dead hundreds of unarmed Moslems after the U.N. safe haven of Srebrenica fell to Bosnian Serb forces in July 1995, is to appear at a pre-sentencing hearing on November 19.</p>
<p>Former Bosnian Croat militia leader General Tihomir Blaskic, who surrendered to the tribunal in April, is due to go on trial for war crimes in January.</p>
<p>Altogether the tribunal has so far indicted 75 suspects, mostly Serbs (one of whom has since died) and holds seven men in its cells near The Hague.</p>
<p>But the tribunal's efforts have been hampered by constant budgetary constraints, a lack of cooperation from authorities in the former Yugoslavia region and minimal encouragement from the international community that established it.</p>
<p>Its two most wanted men -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his army commander, General Ratko Mladic -- remain at large.</p>
<p>Bosnian representatives speculated at the weekend that Opacic's allegations that Sarejevo police had put him up to testifying against Tadic were aimed at undermining the tribunal and by extension the case for arresting Karadzic and Mladic.</p>
