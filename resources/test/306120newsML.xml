<p>Spanish conservative Jose Maria Gil-Robles Gil Delgado was elected president of the European Parliament on Tuesday and told immediately to change the system which got him there.</p>
<p>A surprisingly large protest vote of almost one third of the assembly and welcome speeches mixed with retribution threw doubts over the survival of a cosy arrangement under which the assembly's biggest groups and countries pre-cook the result.</p>
<p>Under a long-standing deal the Socialists and mainly Christian Democrat European People's Party share the parliament's top job between them during the five-year legislature.</p>
<p>The choice of the EPP candidate to take over from German Socialist Klaus Haensch in the run-up to the next elections in June 1999 then came down to a deal between its two biggest national delegations Germany and Spain.</p>
<p>Gil-Robles, who won 338 votes, saw his challenger France's Catherine Lalumiere gain 177. She said beforehand she would be happy with 80.</p>
<p>Thanking those who voted for her Lalumiere said she had never imagined she would get so many votes and that the result carried "an essential political message for the survival and credibility of our institution."</p>
<p>The protest vote confirmed the deep dissatisfaction with the way the presidency has become the prerogative of the parliament's two biggest groups, something the small groups fear challenges the assembly's independence from  national capitals.</p>
<p>"Almost a third of the members of this parliament have voted in protest at this election -- you should be aware of that," Liberal leader Gijs De Vries told Gil-Robles.</p>
<p>Green leader Claudia Roth told Gil-Robles to "see to it that you will be able to give the parliament its own image which distinguishes it clearly from national government interests," pointing to national governments' role in the backroom deal.</p>
<p>She said it was now time for a woman to hold the presidency -- only one, France's Simone Veil, has ever been president.</p>
<p>Jean-Claude Pasty, the leader of the assembly's third biggest group, the Union for Europe, said it had voted for Gil-Robles but he should take steps to wipe out the monopoly on democratic grounds.</p>
<p>He said the parliament often called on the EU to increase its democratic image and the assembly should now do the same.</p>
<p>Gil-Robles's first words after taking the chair included thanks to Lalumiere, a former Council of Europe Secretary General.</p>
<p>"I think the votes she gained have only increased her prestige in this house," he said of the leader of the parliament's alternative European Radical Alliance group.</p>
<p>The big groups defended the system.</p>
<p>Pauline Green, the leader of the biggest group the Socialists, said that the system was no different from that which worked in other parliaments, as it was always the majority which set the agenda.</p>
<p>"This is the very best system that we can apply to this parliament," she said.</p>
<p>"It's not a question of dictatorship of the majority political groups," EPP leader Wilfried Martens told the assembly.</p>
