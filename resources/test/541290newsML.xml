<p>Germany's Transrapid high-speed rail project would continue under a new financing and management structure after the departure of three construction groups, Transportation Minister Matthias Wissmann said on Friday.</p>
<p>Railway Deutsche Bahn AG would take a central role in operating and marketing a proposed Hamburg-Berlin magnetic-levitation line now expected to generate annual revenue of 790 million marks ($460.8 million) by 2010, he said at a news conference.</p>
<p>($ = 1.714 German Marks)  </p>
<p>Wissmann admitted that revenue outlook was lower than a previous forecast of 1.15 billion marks in annual sales.</p>
<p>Phillip Holzmann, Hochtief and Bilfinger + Berger withdrew from the project, and Deutsche Bahn, Thyssen AG, Siemens AG, and Adtranz, a venture between car maker Daimler-Benz AG and Swiss-Swedish group ABB, would open construction to bidding, he said.</p>
<p>The group was open for another European partner. Total investment was expected to be about 10 percent higher than the original estimate of nine billlion marks.</p>
<p>Wissmann said the project would create 18,000 construction jobs. A further 4,400 workers would be needed to operate the system.  </p>
<p>Thyssen AG on Friday vowed to forge ahead with a high-speed train consortium. "The project is now more secure financially," a spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The consortium was negotiating with foreign investors interested in joining the project, he said.</p>
<p>The Transrapid has come under criticism both as to whether there is sufficient demand for it in Germany and whether it can justify the six billion marks of state funding Bonn plans to offer for it.</p>
<p>Holzmann told Reuters that the Transrapid consortium considered the costs associated with the German construction firms were too high. The three builders saw no room for the cost reductions demanded by the other partners, Holzmann said.</p>
<p>"We have been informed that the remaining partners in the consortium will take on the costs of the project themselves," a Holzmann spokesman said.</p>
