<p>DOWNER FEARS FOR SAFETY OF AUSSIES IN CAMBODIA</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Alexander Downer says he holds real fears for the safety of more than 500 Australians in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>Cambodia's Coalition Government appears on the brink of collapse after two-days of heavy fighting in the capital.</p>
<p>Forces loyal to the Second Prime Minister, Hun Sen, claim they control most of the city, and Hun Sen himself has declared his Royalist co-leader is a traitor.</p>
<p>Downer says the situation is so serious, it may be too dangerous to evacuate the Australians.</p>
<p>But he says there are contingency plans to bring Australians out if the fighting worsens.</p>
<p>Downer says they could be evacuated by road, river or air, but the advice the government has received is that their safety is best guaranteed by them staying where they are.</p>

<p>RAIL UNIONS FIGHT JOB CUTS IN NSW</p>
<p>Rail unions are warning of possible industrial action over a proposal to cut nearly 2,000 rail jobs across New South Wales.</p>
<p>The State Rail planning blueprint, leaked yesterday by the state opposition, recommends a reduction of 1750 jobs over three years, including 500 Country Link positions.</p>
<p>State Rail's Chief Executive, David Hill, says there will be no forced redundancies and no reduction to rail services or public safety.</p>
<p>But the plan has been attacked by unions, who claim they have been misled by the government.</p>
<p>Assistant Secretary of the Australian Services Union, George Panigiris, says the cuts will have a severe impact on country New South Wales.</p>

<p>BID TO TRANSPORT COAL FROM STRIKE-BOUND MINE</p>
<p>FreightCorp has confirmed it will be sending two coal trains to the Hunter Valley today in an attempt to transport coal from the Hunter Valley Number One Mine.</p>
<p>Miners are on strike there over the issue of non-union individual contracts.</p>
<p>Coal and Allied has decided to use management in an attempt to break the three-week-old strike.</p>
<p>It ordered a train on Friday to the mine which was to be loaded by management but the driver stopped 100 metres short of the gate refusing to cross the picket line.</p>
<p>FreightCorp has confirmed the company has now ordered two trains in a second attempt to get coal out of the site.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman for FreightCorp says it will not get involved in the issue but is simply fulfilling its contractural arrangements with Coal and Allied.</p>

<p>MEAT INDUSTRY CAMPAIGNS AGAINST INSPECTION CHARGE HIKE</p>
<p>Federal MP's in regional electorates are being targetted in a campaign by the meat industry against increased inspection fees.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth lifted inspection charges significantly three weeks ago.</p>
<p>The National Meat Association says two abbatoirs, one in Queensland and the other in the Northern Territory, have already closed as a result of the government's decision.</p>
<p>It says an initial survey shows the increased fees have backfired in regional electorates.</p>
<p>Chief executive, David Abba, says federal politicians will also be put in the spotlight.</p>
<p>He says the Association will this week survey MP's attitudes to "these new taxes on the meat industry" and publish what they have to say.</p>
<p>Mr Abba says politicians will face an electoral backlash at the next poll if they support the tax.</p>

<p>YOUTH CHARGED WITH THREATENING TO BLOW UP PLANE</p>
<p>A 17-year-old youth will appear in Sydney's Lidcombe Childrens Court this morning charged with threatening to blow up a Qantas plane.</p>
<p>It's alleged he called Qantas five times on Friday using the pseudonym Mr Brown, and claimed a bomb was on a plane heading for Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The court was told yesterday he threatened to detonate the bomb unless he was given A$500,000.</p>
<p>Police claim a search of his house revealed information on how to make bombs that was obtained from the Internet.</p>

<p>CALL TO MICRO-CHIP HORSES</p>
<p>The National League for the Protection of Horses is calling on governments to institute compulsory micro-chipping of horses, to help track down owners who neglect or abandon their animals.</p>
<p>League President, Barry Tapp, says the micro-chips are a cheap and effective way of bringing the owners to book.</p>
<p>He says hundreds of horses have been abandoned and left to die, because the drought has made feeding them too expensive.</p>
<p>But Tapp says the horses can be handed over to the League which will care for them, or surrendered to other welfare groups.</p>
