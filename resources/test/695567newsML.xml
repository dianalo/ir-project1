<p>IPE gas oil futures closed firmer, but off session highs, with the timing of Iraqi exports the main driver behind an otherwise cautious market, brokers said.</p>
<p>July gas oil closed $1.50 a tonne up at $165.25, having touched a high of $166. August Brent was trading mid-range at $18.35 a barrel at 1708 GMT, having failed to break through resistance at $18.45.</p>
<p>Iraqi envoy Abdul Amir al-Anbari said that he did not anticipate Baghdad resuming crude flows until August.</p>
<p>"It would take about a month for the new resolution to be implemented, including the oil sales," Anbari told Reuters in an interview in Geneva on Monday.</p>
<p>The market had foreseen an early to mid-July date after Iraqi oil minister Amir Muhammed Rasheed last week predicted quick agreement with the United Nations on an aid distribution plan.</p>
<p>IPE and NYMEX futures both firmed on Anbari's remarks, but gains were modest and trading volumes thin.</p>
<p>Brokers said that the upcoming long weekend in the United States for Independence Day was subduing activity.</p>
<p>"Maybe there's a lack of commitment to new positions bearing in mind the long holiday coming up...people don't want to be exposed for too long," said a broker.</p>
