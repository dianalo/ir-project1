<p>The German Bund market is not to be shunned but neither will it pay investors any big favors following last week's larger than expected Bundesbank rate cut, US analysts said.</p>
<p>"Because the Bundesbank cut rates in an environment where the German economy is looking stronger, (it) doesn't provide much relief for the German Bund market," said Chris Widness, international economist at Chase Securities.  </p>
<p>Widness said the unavoidable linking of bond markets globally also portends a tough road ahead for German Bunds. Specifically, he said the U.S. market will add pressure.</p>
<p>"We think U.S. yields will drift higher with a strong employment report," Widness said, adding "with U.S. yields rising it's hard to see German bond yields coming down."</p>
<p>The only way for the two markets to "de-link," he said, is if the dollar should strengthen significantly.  </p>
<p>Other analysts said the German decision to cut rates was taken with the future of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union in mind, and that a reversal in economic policy is therefore unlikely through early 1997 as Europe attempts to meet the strict Maastricht convergence criteria.</p>
<p>"If you believe the Germans made a cut partly to help accommodate EMU and that they will keep teasing the markets for some time to come, that means that the monetary environment in Europe as a whole is pretty benign," said Micheal Casey, international economist at MFR Inc.  </p>
<p>For the U.S. investor, the latest rate cut and EMU-friendly stance of the Bundesbank suggests yield convergence will favor U.S. Treasuries as Bund yields converge upward, said Jonathan Francis, head of global strategy at Putnam Investments.</p>
<p>"To date (yields) have been converging down to the German level and this now raises the prospect that there will be at least a partial retracement of that," Francis said.</p>
<p>Ten year spreads should move from about 45 basis points below U.S. Treasuries back toward zero, Francis said.  </p>
<p>Casey said high-yielding European markets will be the primary benefactors of softer German monetary policy, and carry trades will be back in vogue.</p>
<p>"You're going to see money go back into these carry trades in the Spains, the Swedens, etc." he said, adding "the rate cut is not a bad thing for Bunds...it's just better for some of the other markets."</p>
<p>But Widness said there are too many political uncertainties in Europe to bank on its high-yield debt.  </p>
<p>"There's concern that Italy, Spain and France could back away from their budget cutting routines," he said. "If you're looking for a high-yielder that has potential to appreciate I would look at Canadian bonds."</p>
<p>Because Canada said it is no longer trying to ease short-term rates after last week's cut, there is upward potential for the Canadian dollar, Widness said.</p>
<p>In support of the Bund market, Casey contends the rate cut will not necessarily lead to a deterioration of the mark against the dollar. Longer dated German money market rates barely budged when the Bundesbank eased last week, he noted.</p>
<p>"The market is pretty convinced the Germans are easing now, they're going to be on hold for a while, and they're going to be tightening next autumn," Casey said. "In other words, the market is building in a fairly robust German economy sometime next year, whereas on ours they're building in a fairly lackluster economy," Casey said.</p>
<p>Casey said there is still room for rate cuts in Germany, however, as the discount rate sits 50 basis points higher than the repo rate. The Bundesbank could trim another 25 to 30 basis points, he said.</p>
