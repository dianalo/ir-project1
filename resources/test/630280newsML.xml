<p>Poland's biggest oil refinery Petrochemia Plock signed a long-term contract with oil and gas company PGNiG on Monday for natural gas to be used in its new hydrocracking installation, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The target size of (gas) deliveries will amount to 10 percent of national consumption," the statement said.</p>
<p>A Plock official told Reuters by telephone that the refinery and PGNiG (Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo) had agreed not to reveal the value of the 20-year deal.</p>
<p>Last month Plock opened a hydrogen unit, the first section of the $400 million hydrocracking complex, and it needs gas as the source of hydrogen used in extracting sulphur dioxide.</p>
<p>The natural gas will also supplement supplies used for furnaces and heating in the local area. Plock will be able to make use of surpluses appearing in the national grid.</p>
<p>"It is expected that current use will work out at about 0.5 billion standard cubic metres for production of hydrogen," the Plock statement said, adding that the refinery would have capacity to deal with one billion standard cubic metres of gas a year, a target to be reached in the year 2000.</p>
<p>Plock said the opening of the hydrocracking installation would complete the second stage of its modernisation.</p>
<p>"We estimate that we have spent $1.1 billion so far, which has advanced our programme by more than 60 percent," the statement said.</p>
<p>"This latest technology will result in estimated growth in production of fuels by 1.2 million tonnes a year -- petrol by about 500,000 tonnes, diesel by about 600,000 tonnes, aviation fuel by 100,000 tonnes and liquid gas by 40,000 tonnes," it said.</p>
<p>Plock said earlier it expected the installation to boost petrol output by 20 percent, allowing it to drop the production of the 94-octane leaded fuel and increase the share of 95- and 98-octane unleaded petrol to 87 percent of all produced petrol.</p>
<p>Petrochemia processed about 10.5 million tonnes of crude oil in 1996, of which petrol production accounted for some 30 percent. It expects to process 12.6 million tonnes of crude oil per year when it finishes its modernisation programme in 2000.</p>
