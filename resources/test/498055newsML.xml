<headline>EU to discuss ban on British gelatine exports.</headline>

<p>The European Commission will next week discuss steps to reassure consumers worried by mad cow disease by making it illegal to export British gelatine -- although none is currently being exported, the Commission said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>EU Food Safety Commissioner Emma Bonino had told the Commission that there was no reliable process to ensure gelatine, a beef by-product, was safe from mad cow disease, a commission spokesman said.</p>
<p>"We want a legal cover for what is happening at the moment," he said.</p>
<p>The European Union imposed a worldwide ban on British exports of beef and beef products in March 1996 shortly after London disclosed that the disease -- known medically as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) --could be passed to humans.</p>
<p>But last June the EU's executive Commission controversially eased the ban on exports of British gelatine, which is widely used in food, cosmetics and medicinal products, provided stricter processing rules were respected.</p>
<p>The stricter rules were intended to ensure that the infectious BSE agent, which has killed more than 165,000 British cattle since the first case was reported 10 years ago, was eradicated.</p>
<p>Despite easing the ban, the European Union has not allowed any exports of gelatine made from British beef because British manufacturers have not fulfilled the preconditions.</p>
<p>They considered the heat processing terms so stringent that it made production uneconomic. Instead manufacturers turned to beef raw materials from other countries. Less than 500 cattle have died from the fatal brain disease in other EU member states.</p>
<p>Bonino earlier told reporters that there might also have to be a formal ban on the use of specified risk material from sheep and cattle -- skull, brain, eyes, spleen -- for manufacturing gelatine.</p>
<p>It would cover all EU countries and imports from third countries, she added.</p>
<p>"We will have to take action in the light of the new information presented but the end result will be rather positive, notably for the consumer," Bonino said.</p>
<p>Following next week's discussion, EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler will decide whether to draft a proposal for discussion by the EU's Standing Veterinary Committee of senior member state officials. A final decision could be taken by May 1.</p>
