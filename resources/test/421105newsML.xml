<p>Turkish steel producers are getting ready to establish a fund to encourage production halts to cut excess supplies of rolled steel. The surplus helps to undermine prices in international markets.</p>
<p>"Our member companies will pay five dollars per tonne of produced steel to the fund," Namik Ekinci, president of the iron and steel producers association of Turkey, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Some $52.5 million is expected to be collected if there are no production halts.</p>
<p>"If any of our members prefer to halt production, the company will receive $20 to $45 per tonne for their unused production capacity," he added.</p>
<p>Turkey has around 10 million tonnes of annual rolled steel output capacity, far above estimated domestic of 5.5 million tonnes. Most Turkish plants export excess output.</p>
<p>Steel producers, backed by the government, aim to cut the total annual output to a maximum of three million tonnes.</p>
<p>"Because of the excess production, Turkish producers cannot act as reluctant sellers which causes export prices to plunge," Ekinci said, adding that reductions in supply would make selling prices climb to a "reasonable" level.</p>
<p>On the other hand, cutting supply will also narrow the country's annual imports of 7.5 million tonnes of scrap iron, the biggest in the world.</p>
<p>"Scrap iron prices will shrink with our measures to control output and therefore, the production costs of our members will decrease," Ekinci said.</p>
<p>The fund will be established after the system is approved by the Turkish government, which will act as the supervisor.</p>
