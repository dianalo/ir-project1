<p>Chris Boniol tied an NFL record with seven field goals -- five in the first half -- and the defence held Brett Favre in check as the Dallas Cowboys defeated the Green Bay Packers 21-6 on Monday.</p>
<p>Boniol hit field goals of 45, 37, 42, 45 and 35 yards in the first half and 39 and 29 yards in the second half to join the St. Louis' Cardinals Jim Bakken (1967) and Minnesota Viking's Rich Karlis (1989) as the only players to kick seven field goals in a game.</p>
<p>"I feel good," Boniol said. "It's something I'm proud of. "I've been in bed 2-1/2 days with the flu and I didn't feel good in practice. But once the game started I felt okay."</p>
<p>Boniol's last field goal came with just 20 seconds left in regulation after Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman took a knee, leading the Packers to believe the Cowboys were going to run out the clock.</p>
<p>But the Cowboys kicked another field goal that angered the Packers, and a fight broke out.</p>
<p>The Packer's all-star defensive end, Reggie White, said, "The Cowboys are classless. The game was (expletive) over."</p>
<p>Dallas held Green Bay without a touchdown until 1:53 remained in the game, long after the outcome was no longer in doubt. It was the fifth of 11 games this season that the Cowboys defence has held an opponent under 10 points.</p>
<p>Favre was held to just 194 yards, completing 21-of-36, most while under pressure from a swarming Dallas defence.</p>
<p>"Basically we came out to contain Bret and stop the run," said Dallas linebacker Broderick Thomas. "We have a package when I come in, and I went for the quarterback all day."</p>
<p>One bright spot for Green Bay was the play of tight end Keith Jackson, who had seven catches for 98 yards as Favre's primary target.</p>
<p>Aikman continued his strong play against the Packers, completing 24-of-35 passes for 206 yards. Emmitt Smith added 20 carries for 76 yards, and Michael Irvin had five receptions, including a pair of key catches in the first half, for 66 yards.</p>
<p>After stopping the Packers three-and-out on the first series of the game, the Cowboys took over and needed just six plays to score. Aikman hit a 31-yard bomb to Irvin that put the ball on the Green Bay 31, and three plays later Boniol converted a 45-yard opportunity.</p>
<p>Another three-and-out by the Packers offence gave the Cowboys good position and they capitalised on it.  Moving 35 yards in nine plays, Dallas seized a 9-0 advantage when Boniol hit a 42-yarder.</p>
<p>Again the Packers mustered nothing offensively, and Dallas took over near midfield. Aikman found Kevin Williams, who was returning from a broken foot, for 10 yards and Michael Irvin for nine.  But the possession stalled and Boiniol's fourth field goal was from 45 yards out.</p>
<p>Favre dropped back to pass three times on Green Bay's next drive and again failed to produce a first down. Dallas took over on its 20 and utilized the two-minute offence to drive to the Packer 17. Boniol hit a 35-yarder with seven seconds left in the half for a 15-0 advantage.</p>
