<p>A $2.0 billion deal by Samsung Electronics to supply personal computer screens to International Business Machines Corp helps Samsung lock up stable demand for the next three years, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said the deal, revealed on Tuesday by Samsung sources, was also a vote of confidence by IBM in the quality and technology of the South Korean firm's product.</p>
<p>Samsung Electronics, flagship company of giant Samsung Group, will start shipping out the five million monitors over the next three years from March, Samsung sources said.</p>
<p>The monitors for IBM desk-top PCs will be 15 and 17 inch models, they said.</p>
<p>But although expected to help Samsung's sagging profits, the deal was unlikely to repair damage inflicted by falling global prices of computer chips.</p>
<p>"Samsung's biggest merit for the IBM deal was securing stable demand for PC monitors," said Park Chan-yup, an electronics analyst at Hyundai Securities.</p>
<p>Samsung Electronics, the world's largest computer monitor supplier, expects exports of 10 million monitors next year against eight million this year, a Samsung official said.</p>
<p>"The long-term agreement means Samsung has earned recognition from IBM in terms of monitor technology and quality," said Han Ilsuk, electronics analyst at ING-Barings Securities.</p>
<p>Samsung has supplied a smaller number of monitors to IBM before on a one-year basis, the Samsung official said.</p>
<p>Analysts viewed the deal favourably considering the world's supply of PC monitors could outweigh demand in the next couple of years.</p>
<p>"PC monitor supplies could slowly outpace demand as rising demand for liquid crystal display (LCD) monitors are expected to grow, squeezing the demand for PC monitors," said Hyundai's Park. "It's a profitable deal considering those monitors could have piled up in stock."</p>
<p>But industry sources said the contract would not be lucrative enough to offset a plunge in Samsung's semiconductor sales, the company's biggest revenue earner.</p>
<p>"This is likely to help us recover our profitability, but not enough to cover for the slump in semiconductors," the Samsung official said.</p>
<p>Han at ING-Barings said: "Profit margins from monitor sales cannot be compared with that of dynamic random access memory chips (DRAM)."</p>
<p>"But this shows Samsung efforts to shift its focus to sales of communication equipment from home appliances," he said.</p>
<p>Falling global chip prices have plagued Samsung, more than halving net profit for the first half of this year. Analysts say semiconductor prices are likely to remain in a slump and continue to trouble the world's leading supplier of DRAM chips. "The 16 megabit DRAM chip prices are expected to fall further next year to around $8," said another Samsung official.</p>
<p>The unit price for the 16 DRAM chips fell 81.2 percent to $9.5 in November from a year earlier.</p>
<p>Samsung Electronics posted a net profit of 453.4 billion won ($545.6 million) in the first six months, down from 1.13 trillion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Dongwon Economic Research Institute said Samsung was expected to record a net profit of 405 billion won this year, down sharply from 2.5 trillion last year. Samsung Electronics's turnover is seen at 17 trillion won this year, slightly higher than 16 trillion a year ago.</p>
