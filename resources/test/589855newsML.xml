<p>The Bulgarian lev fell to 1,542-1,545 in light interbank volume at the opening on Friday from 1,534-1,536 at Thursday's close due to a cut in the central bank main interest rate, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The lev is under pressure as banks and clients are actively covering short (foreign currency) positions due to the main rate cut. Dollar supply is waning and the lev might fall further," a bank dealer said.</p>
<p>The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) on Thursday said it would cut its main interest rate to 4.29 percent monthly from 5.20 percent, effective from Monday.  </p>
<p>This would give a cumulative effective annual interest rate of 65.54 percent calculated through the monthly accruals, the BNB said.</p>
<p>Foreign currency supply declined as investors that have actively sold dollars for levs since March to buy high-yield government securities, now were not seen in the market, traders said.</p>
