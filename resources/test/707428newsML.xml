<p>British Petroleum Co Plc forecast its output in Venezuela would double to 50,000 barrels per day from current levels of 25,000 barrels per day by the end of 1998, company chiefs said.</p>
<p>BP is a relative newcomer in Venezuela with just three years experience there, said Iain Conn, vice chairman of BP's Piedemonte 1 project.</p>
<p>"Current production in Venezuela is about 25,000 barrels per day including Pedernales and Kirikiri (in eastern Venezuela). But by the end of 1998 we hope to be above 50,000 barrels," Conn said in a Reuters interview.  </p>
<p>Explaining the reasons for the transfer of the post of Latin American head of BP to Caracas, Doust said: "We have a well established business here in Colombia which is recognized as extremely successful. We're becoming more established in Venezuela and we're seen as a respected player there too and that puts us very firmly on the map in Latin America."</p>
<p>Moving the Latin American operations head to Caracas would help nurture business in Venezuela, he said.</p>
<p>In Venezuela BP operates the Pedernales and Kirikiri fields which are so-called "reactivated" fields, previously thought uncommercial but revived using new technology.</p>
<p>It also has a contract to exploit the Guarapiche field, also in eastern Venezuela, in partnership with Maxus Energy Corp and Amoco. Conn did not comment on the development timetable of Guarapiche.</p>
<p>He also played down rumors that BP was considering a $2 billion to $3 billion project to extract heavy crude from Venezuela's Orinoco belt.</p>
<p>"Venezuela has asked some companies to look at (heavy crude in the Orinoco belt) to see if it could work. But there's no specific project or reserves identified as yet...heavy crude is very difficult to work in economic terms, we're looking at the possibilities but we're at an early conceptual stage," Conn said.</p>
<p>Venezuela has about 73 billion barrels of proven reserves, the largest in the hemisphere. It is estimated that the country could have another 270 billion barrels of heavy crude in the Orinoco region.</p>
