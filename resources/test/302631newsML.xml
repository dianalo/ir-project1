<p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) is ready to complete talks on helping to haul Bulgaria's crumbling economy back from the brink of default as soon as it has a stable government, an official said on Monday.</p>
<p>"We would need assurances for credible commitments to implementing the programme on behalf of the counterparts with whom we will discuss it," an IMF official who declined to be named told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The IMF was set to send a mission in mid-January, but now the Fund will wait until the political situation is cleared."</p>
<p>Pressure is growing on the ruling Socialist Party, composed largely of ex-communists, to hold a general election nearly two years ahead of schedule, after seven straight days of anti-government protests in the capital and provincial cities.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund had begun talks with the outgoing Socialist government, which resigned on December 21, on the implementation of a strict fixed exchange rate regime as a last resort to restore confidence in the financial system.</p>
<p>Talks were expected to be completed after parliamentary approval for a new government, which was due by mid-January.</p>
<p>However outgoing President Zhelyu Zhelev postponed handing a mandate to form the government to outgoing Interior Minister Nikolai Dobrev, nominated by the Socialists as prime minister, until the Socialists agreed to a general election.</p>
<p>Zhelev and president-elect Petar Stoyanov, who is due to be sworn in on Sunday, said elections were the only way out of the crisis.</p>
<p>The speaker of parliament, Blagovest Sendov, said the ruling Socialist party, should agree to the opposition's demands, urging them to start negotiations immediately.</p>
<p>"Clearly the economic situation is worsening and something urgently needs to be done," he said.</p>
<p>Month-on-month inflation soared to 26.9 percent in December from just over nine percent in November after a series of price increases on basic food and fuel items. Annual inflation is running at a rate of more than 300 percent.</p>
<p>The IMF and the World Bank suspended funding due to the Socialist government's failure to reduce budget-draining subsidies and boost revenue through sell-offs.</p>
<p>In November the IMF proposed the introduction of the currency board system, which severly curbs financial powers of the government and the central bank, to boost confidence in the crumbling financial system.</p>
<p>Preparations for the currency board, due to be completed by February, included restructuring the central bank, passing in parliament a viable 1997 budget and approving amendments to banking laws.</p>
<p>It is unclear when parliament, whose building suffered serious damage in a 10-hour demonstrators' siege on Friday, would be able to vote on the legal amendments.</p>
<p>The opposition has walked out of parliament until their demands for an early election are met.</p>
