<p>The Ratana movement would not give allegiance to any political party but would keep an "open door" policy, it told political leaders at the weekend. Labour leader Helen Clark said NZ First had "badly overplayed its hand" by saying before the weekend's hui at Ratana Pa that it expected it would be pledged Ratana's support. "NZ First tripped over themselves with their claims that Ratana was going with NZ First, but it just wasn't true. They have been telling a lot of fibs about their support from Ratana for a long time." Page 2.</p>

<p>Labour MP Mike Moore has drafted a member's bill to change the name of Waitangi Day to New Zealand Day. Moore said the day's name "strikes at the heart of what it is to be a New Zealander and should be decided through debate and eventual consensus." Moore said injustices did exist, but New Zealand's national day should be "a celebration of progress made, not a time of guilt and recriminations." Page 2.</p>

<p>The $1 million that the government said would fund a women's commissioner could be much better spent elsewhere, Labour women's affairs spokeswoman Dianne Yates said. However, a spokeswoman for Women's Affairs Minister Christine Fletcher could not confirm that the position would be established, despite its inclusion in the coalition agreement. The agreement says the government will agree in principle to establishing the role of women's commissioner, at a cost of $1 million a year. Page 2.</p>

<p>Doctors have joined Labour health spokeswoman Lianne Dalziel in condemning delays in commissioning an inquiry into patient safety at Christchurch hospital. Health Minister, Bill English, who was originally expected to announce the format of an inquiry last week, has held off because of three of the four patient deaths that medical staff say were avoidable are still being investigated by the coroner.

<p>A United Nations report into the Rights of the Child has expressed concerns about the affects of economic reforms on New Zealand's children, young people and famlies. Issues at the weekend, the report by a 10-member United Nations committee looks into New Zealand's compliance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which New Zealand ratified in 1993. The committee said it was concerned that the extensive economic reform process undertaken in New Zealand since the mid 1980s had meant less money for support services for children and their families.

<p>Payment on New Zealand Petroleum's $4.38 million worth of South Petroleum redeemable preference shares could begin in March if the Mangahewa-2 well proved viable, the company said. NZ Petroleum holds an interest in South Petroleum's onshore licence area, Taranaki PPL 39805, through 4380 redeemable preference shares issued at $1000. Southern Petroleum's owner Fletcher Challenge, told the Stock Exchange last week that gas from Mangahewa-2 well could be sold in about six weeks if hydraulic fracturing was successful. Page 13.</p>
