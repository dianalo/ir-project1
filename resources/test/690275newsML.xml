<p>White sugar futures may be looking for a renewed test on the upside now that this week's heavy fund selling appeared to have been absorbed, trade sources said.</p>
<p>At 1100 GMT the near August position was trading at $320.00 a tonne, a rise of $1.10 from Wednesday's , having touched $321.00 at one stage. Total turnover was 717 lots.</p>
<p>In a technical comment on near August LIFFE white sugar, brokers Sucden said "...there is now a good chance that downmove has run its course. Support at $315 held and we now look for a re-test of $325 resistance."</p>
<p>The market was awaiting New York's opening to see if there is any significant follow through Wednesday's rise.</p>
<p>Paris white sugar was $0.40 higher with August trading at $319.70 a tonne and total turnover was 172 lots.</p>
