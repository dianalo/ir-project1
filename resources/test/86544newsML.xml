<p>New Zealand's new wholesale electricity market geared up for its launch on Monday as players began entering bids and offers in the day-ahead and physical markets.</p>
<p>When the market officially opens on Tuesday, the wholesale price of electricity will for the first time be discovered on the basis of supply and demand, as opposed to the cost-based method employed in the past.</p>
<p>"Apart from the demand side no longer being passive price takers, the key thing is that we will actually see how prices are formed, and efficient economic signals will emanate from the market which havn't been around before," said Lincoln Gould, chief executive of market operator EMCO (Electricity Market Company).</p>
<p>The day-ahead market is purely a financial hedging market through which players can manage their risks and lock in prices for the next day. Their dealings in this market are netted off against their actual transactions in the physical market.</p>
<p>The physical spot market is where electricity is traded.</p>
<p>The sellers place offers into the market pool on a half-hourly basis. They might offer the capacity of a certain hydro station for a given period at a given price. Power companies then place bids into the pool for the volume of electricity they are prepared to purchase at a particular price.</p>
<p>Offers and bids become supply and demand curves on a graph. The point at which the curves intersect becomes the market clearing price -- the price at which a certain amount of electricity is cleared at a given time.</p>
<p>There are approximately 200 such graphs for each of the electricity injection and exit points on the national grid. The cheapest source of electricity is thus easily identified, signalling where the next power station should be built.</p>
<p>"In the past we had grandiose engineering schemes built for their own sake. Now with this new market, with these efficient price signals coming, we will get shareholders and investors taking risks and not the taxpayer -- those are the big advantages," said Gould.</p>
<p>He expects between 30,000 and 33,000 gigawatts of electricity to be traded through the market annually, depending on how many bilateral supply contracts are negotiated between generators and power purchasers.</p>
<p>"This is, after all, a voluntary market and it is possible for buyers and sellers to establish bilateral physical contracts and bypass the market."</p>
<p>Power companies will have to juggle the risk of the spot market against the more expensive but certain fixed contracts.</p>
<p>"This market has been designed so that risks lie where they fall, and it will be those organisations that are best able to manage commercial risk that will survive," Gould said.</p>
<p>Generators are expected to compete with each other in order to get their electricity dispatched, putting downward pressure on prices, and their clients, the electricity retailers, are expected to compete with each other for a share of the deregulated retail market.</p>
<p>Gould said the market was unique in being self-regulated, in contrast to government-controlled versions overseas.</p>
<p>New Zealand's market is only open to physical traders of electricity, but there are plans for a futures contract, opening the possibility of international investor involvement.</p>
<p>"That's the beauty -- we've now started a market which will open up the opportunity for all sorts of creativity, and I'm expecting that you will see new products come to the market, you'll see all sorts of initiatives that we haven't even thought of yet," Gould said.</p>
