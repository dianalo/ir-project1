<p>State-run Steel Authority of India Lt (SAIL) said on Thursday it expects its 1996/97 (April-March) net profit to fall below the previous year on the back of rising input costs.</p>
<p>"Our net profit will be less than the previous year because of a steady rise in cost of inputs," Arvind Pande, SAIL's newly appointed chairman, told a news conference. SAIL is India's largest steelmaker.</p>
<p>"SAIL is facing a cumulative impact of 11.0 billion rupees during the current financial year because of hikes in input prices," Pande said.</p>
<p>He said coking coal prices had gone up by over 27 per cent, while prices of petroleum products had risen between 15-25 percent.</p>
<p>"SAIL's profitability is also affected by the increase in railway freight, special customs duty and power tariff," Pande said.</p>
<p>He said SAIL planned drastic cost cutting measures which would increase its gross margin by around 1.5 billion rupees during the remaining period of the current fiscal year. He did not give details.</p>
<p>"We are also negotiating with (state-run) Coal India limited for a long-term agreement on quality, quantity and prices to prevent indiscriminate rise in coal prices," he said.</p>
<p>Pande said the steel industry needed to grow by 10 percent annually to achieve seven per cent economic growth projected during the ninth five-year plan period from 1997 to 2002.</p>
<p>"Higher industrial growth together with improved economic conditions will lead to considerable increase in the demand for steel and we will have a much improved performance after 97/98," he added.</p>
