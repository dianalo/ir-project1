<p>Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corp said on Tuesday a new investor group, Minoro Mining and Exploration Corp, had reached an agreement in principle with its creditors to assume its 3.7-billion peso debt.</p>
<p>Minoro Mining, which is a Filipino firm led by mining engineer Frank Lubbock, will be issued new shares of Atlas at 10 pesos per share to become the largest shareholder, Atlas said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Final settlement is expected to take place early in the fourth quarter of 1997 at which time Atlas will be virtually debt free and in a strong position to progress with the rehabilitation of its wholly owned Toledo copper mine," it said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Atlas said it has appointed Rothschild Australia Ltd and ABN Amro Hoare Govett as its financial advisers.</p>
<p>Atlas, Minoro and the financial advisers have started sourcing funds to bring back the Carmen copper mine in Toledo city, Cebu province back into full scale production.</p>
<p>Atlas' Carmen copper mine was shut down in 1994 after a massive mudflow.</p>
<p>The firm said it planned to reopen the mine at a production rate of 42,000 tonnes of ore per day. It did not give a specific timetable for the commercial production of the mine.</p>
