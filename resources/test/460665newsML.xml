<p>Finnish national airline Finnair Oy said on Friday it would ask European Airbus Industrie and Boeing Co of the United States for offers for 12 new aircraft to replace its ageing DC9s.</p>
<p>"Both manufacturers have a family of aircraft representing three different sizes and suitable for Finnair's purposes," Finnair said.</p>
<p>Finnair said prices for the aircraft varied according to size between $25 million and $40 million. "The value of the acquisitions now under consideration would be around two billion markka," it said, adding: "Some of the aircraft can be leased."</p>
<p>Finnair said it expected to receive the offers during April. No deadline was set for the decision to order.</p>
<p>"Deliveries would be scheduled so that the aircraft could begin service in 1999-2001," it said.</p>
