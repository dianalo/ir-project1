<p>- There are 105 days to go before the British colony reverts to China. These are highlights of comments in the Hong Kong press. The views expressed are those of the newspapers quoted and do not represent an editorial viewpoint of Reuters.</p>
<p>-- The Beijing-funded TA KUNG PAO said different countries should cooperate over human rights issues, but some countries took an antagonistic attitude toward others. It said the United States had put forward six proposals in the United Nations attacking China's human rights performance but all had failed, and United States would fail again if it repeated the action.</p>
<p>-- MING PAO said the Independent Commission Against Corruption's investigation into alleged syndicated race-fixing showed the determination of the Hong Kong Jockey Club to keep horse racing clean. It said that in the long run, the resolute action of the Jockey Club would enhance the international community's confidence in the territory.</p>
<p>-- ECONOMIC TIMES said experience in Britain and China had proven that increasing social welfare was not the best way to improve people's living standard, and the solution lay in developing the market economy. It said Hong Kong's future leaders and political parties should learn from these experiences when making policies.</p>
