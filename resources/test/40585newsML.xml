<p>Caught between the promise of new AIDS drugs and their rising cost, many U.S. states are limiting access to life-prolonging therapies.</p>
<p>A survey released on Monday found that about half the 50 states were introducing or contemplating such restrictions as waiting lists, lotteries and even the temporarily barring of new patients from AIDS Drug Assistance Programs (ADAP).</p>
<p>Part of a federal AIDS initiative known as the Ryan White Act, ADAP fills the financial gap for patients who are too poor to spend thousands of dollars a year on AIDS drugs but not poor enough for Medicaid health coverage.</p>
<p>The survey prompted patients, doctors and AIDS activists to call for another infusion of federal funds to make sure everybody who needs the drugs gets them. A $52 million boost in federal funding earlier this year will not be enough for many states to make it through the year.</p>
<p>"If we don't have access, we don't have hope. You might as well say, 'Lay down and die,'" Kim Williams, an HIV-infected woman from Mississippi, said. "A lot of people are not ready to die. I'm 25. I'm not ready."</p>
<p>She appeared at a news briefing sponsored by members of Congress and by a coalition of AIDS activist groups and drug companies seeking $200 million more in federal AIDS drug assistance and $70 million more in state assistance next year than was made available in 1996.</p>
<p>The survey, by the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, found cost increases in state ADAP of up to 427 percent in the first seven months of the year because of both the price of drugs and the flood of new patients who can benefit from them.</p>
<p>Unlike earlier medicines, which had limited effectiveness and were recommended only for those with full-blown AIDS, "cocktail" combinations of new drugs appear to control -- though not cure -- the AIDS virus in people in the earliest stages of infection. But that means a far bigger pool of potential patients.</p>
<p>The cocktail of older antiviral drugs plus a new class of medicines called protease inhibitors is expensive, costing about $10,000 to $13,000 per year per patient, according to the most recent estimates.</p>
<p>"Our cost went from a projected $1.1 million this year to a projected $6.1 million -- a 500 percent increase," Washington state Gov. Mike Lowry said. He briefly shut the ADAP program this summer and then reopened it despite the $5 million shortfall in a $44 million state health budget.</p>
<p>"We cannot close this program. It is saving people's lives. It is saving young people's lives," he said, urging the federal government and the drug companies to help.</p>
<p>Because of costs, at least 22 state ADAP programs are limiting or expect to limit access. Fourteen states have not yet begun offering protease inhibitors through ADAP. Some, like Florida, indicated in the survey that they did not foresee having the money to offer wide-reaching drug assistance.</p>
<p>"For the first time in a long time, I've thought about the future," Paul Moore, a 30-year-old, HIV-infected man from Portland, Oregon, told the briefing. "Please support this. Please fund this. It's so needed."</p>
