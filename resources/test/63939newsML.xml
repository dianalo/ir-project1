<p>By Mark Heinrich</p>
<p>The main nationalist parties that led Bosnia into war four years ago have won elections for federal and regional parliaments, according to returns released by international scrutineers on Thursday.</p>
<p>Candidates of the Moslem Party of Democratic Action (SDA), Serb Democratic Party (SDS) and Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) also won the three seats on a new collective presidency with ease in Bosnia's first postwar vote on September 14.</p>
<p>With 122 of 148 counting centres reporting in the divided country, the SDA, SDS and HDZ had built up unbeatable margins to dominate a new Bosnia-wide parliament and two regional assemblies.</p>
<p>The presidency of the Bosnian Serb republic was also won handily by Biljana Plavsic of the SDS.</p>
<p>Critics said the renewal of parallel nationalist powers would be a recipe for the sort of manoeuvring and stalemate that degenerated into war in Bosnia in 1992.</p>
<p>But Western coordinators of Bosnia's peace process, including U.S. architects of the Dayton peace treaty, say they will insist that the factions honour commitments to share power and reunify the Balkan state.</p>
<p>Counting at 75 of 87 tabulation centres on Federation (Moslem-Croat) territory and 47 of 61 centres on Serb Republic (RS) territory was complete by Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Final results were expected later in the day.</p>
<p>Izetbegovic's SDA was polling 55.3 percent of the vote for 28 of 42 seats in the Bosnian House of Representatives reserved for candidates from (Moslem-Croat) Federation territory, which comprises half the country.</p>
<p>The HDZ, the SDA's uneasy partner in the pre-election Federation government, had tallied 23.4 percent and the Party for Bosnia-Herzegovina led by moderate, pro-unity former prime minister Haris Silajdzic, trailed at 8.4 percent.</p>
<p>The ultra-nationalist SDS looked sure to take most of the 14 House seats allotted for parties running in the RS with 54 percent. SDA candidates, presumably backed by Moslem refugees from what is now the RS, followed at 20.6 percent.</p>
<p>In third place with 12 percent was the Union for Peace and Progress (SMP), a left-wing coalition offshoot of Serbia's ruling socialist Party, led by President Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
<p>Plavsic, who became acting president of the Serb entity after indicted Serb war criminal Radovan Karadzic was forced to step down, was in line for the new RS presidency with 66.1 percent of the vote.</p>
<p>Far behind was Zivko Radisic of the Union for Peace and Progress with 16.3 percent. The SDA candidate, Abid Djozic, polled 10.1 percent, presumably from Moslem war refugees.</p>
<p>In the race for the 83-seat National Assembly of the RS, the SDS gained an absolute majority as expected with 62.5 percent based on returns from 44 of 61 centres.</p>
<p>The Democratic Patriotic Bloc had 13.2 percent, the far rightist Serbian Radical Party 7.6 percent and the SDA, backed by Moslem refugees registered in RS territory, 6.4 percent.</p>
<p>For the Federation's 140-seat regional House, the SDA led with 56.2 percent followed by the HDZ with 22.2 percent and Siljadzic's SBiH with 7.6 percent.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Izetbegovic won the right to be Bosnia's head of state for the next two years by outpolling SDS separatist Momcilo Krajisnik and the HDZ's Kresimir Zubak for the chairmanship of a new Bosnian three-man presidency.</p>
