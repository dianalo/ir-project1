<p>An Italian businessman who had refused to pay bribes to win contracts in the 1980s shot himself through the heart because he believed Italy's war on corruption had failed, newspapers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>La Stampa said Ambroglio Mauri, a 66-year-old bus manufacturer, was found in his Milan office on Monday after shooting himself, and died as he was being taken to hospital by helicopter.</p>
<p>A letter written by Mauri just before he shot himself alluded to Italy's "Tangentopoli" (Bribesville) scandal which broke in 1992 and toppled Italy's political old guard, it said.</p>
<p>"Honesty doesn't pay...high standards and transparency don't pay...After Bribesville everything is back the way it was before. This is no longer my world," Mauri wrote.</p>
<p>The reports said Mauri had lost contracts because of his refusal to pay bribes to officials in the 1980s, and had become disillusioned with the 'Clean Hands' probe by public prosecutors into allegations of trial-fixing and bribes for state contracts.</p>
