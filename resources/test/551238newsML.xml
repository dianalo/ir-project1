<p>Shell Canada Ltd., faced with a mountain of cash before it starts work on two big energy projects, said on Wednesday it would buy back up to C$975 million ($702 million) of its shares.</p>
<p>Shell Canada, the Canadian integrated oil arm of Royal Dutch/Shell Group, said it would offer to buy back 16 million shares, or 14 percent of its common stock, at a price between C$53 ($38) and C$61 ($44) a share.</p>
<p>The company, which reported sharply higher first-quarter earnings on Wednesday but sagging oil and gas output, has about C$1.3 billion ($936 million) in cash but few places to spend it until it begins work on the Sable natural gas project off Nova Scotia and a major Alberta oil sands development.</p>
<p>Investors welcomed the move, driving up the value of Shell Canada shares by C$3.90 to C$57.40 ($41.13) on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Under the offer, the Anglo-Dutch parent of Calgary, Alberta-based Shell Canada would maintain its 78 percent stake in Canada's third largest integrated oil company.</p>
<p>Canada's biggest energy company, Exxon Corp. affiliate Imperial Oil Ltd., last year spent C$1.4 billion ($1 billion) on a similar buyback scheme to cut its own cash war chest.</p>
<p>Shell Canada Chief Executive Chuck Wilson told the annual meeting on Wednesday that the buyback would not impede its ability to invest in oil and gas production and refining and marketing operations during the next two years.</p>
<p>But Wilson said he could not guarantee Shell Canada would arrest a decline in conventional oil and gas production in western Canada -- its traditional home base -- over the next three years.</p>
<p>Shell Canada said its first-quarter earnings rose to C$152 million ($109.4 million) or C$1.35 (97 cents) a share from year earlier C$98 million ($70.6 million) or C87 cents (63 cents) a share. First-quarter 1996 earnings were restated to reflect Shell Canada's sale of its chemical division last year.</p>
<p>Quarterly revenues rose to C$1.35 billion ($972 million) from C$1.18 billion ($850 million) in last year's first quarter.</p>
