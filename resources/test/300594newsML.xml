<p>The top civil servant in charge of cleanup operations for one of Japan's worst oil spills was in serious condition in hospital on Friday after an accident on the Tokyo subway system, a government official said.</p>
<p>The Environment Agency official told Reuters that police were investigating the cause of the so-far unexplained accident involving Kazuo Watanabe, 50, director of Japan's Marine Pollution and Waste Management Office.  </p>
<p>The official said Watanabe had been working almost non-stop since January 2, when the Russian tanker Nakhodka, carrying 19,000 tonnes (133,000 barrels) of fuel oil, broke in two in stormy weather in the Sea of Japan.</p>
<p>Japan's Kyodo news agency said Watanabe lost both feet and his right hand in the accident. There were no other details available on the incident.</p>
<p>Watanabe, 50, joined the Environment Agency in 1974 and took over his present post 18 months ago.</p>
<p>The oil spill has fouled 450 km (285 miles) of coastline, making it one of Japan's worst oil pollution accidents.</p>
