<title>MALAYSIA: KL interbank rates fall further on liquidity.</title>

<p>Interbank rates fell further on Wednesday due to improving liquidity and continued aggressive lending by big local banks as well as foreign banks, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Short-end rates are falling very fast and the one- and three-month money is also coming off," said a dealer at a Malaysian bank. "The big banks are long and still lending."</p>
<p>He said players borrowing at the far end of the yield curve on concerns over the Thai baht were lending aggressively at the short-end.</p>
<p>The fall in rates on Wednesday came on the back of maturity of a 500-million ringgit Bank Negara bill issue which further improved market liquidity.</p>
<p>Bank Negara bills worth 1.5 billion ringgit had matured last week. The central bank has not announced any new issue to roll-over the maturities.</p>
<p>Dealers said the focus will be on whether a Bank Negara lending maturity on Thursday, said to be for two billion ringgit, will bring rates back up again.</p>
<p>One-week money was at 6.60/70 percent against 7.20 percent on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>One-month money was at 7.45 percent from 7.55, and three-month at 7.55 percent against 7.60.</p>
<p>The overnight rate was expected to stay around 5.8 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>There has been speculation the central bank, through its agent banks, has been supporting the overnight from falling below its perceived floor of 5.80 percent.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange posted small gains.</p>
<p>At 0330 GMT, the three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was up one point to 92.57, or an implied yield of 7.43 percent.</p>
<p>The December contract rose two to 92.68, or 7.32 percent and March 1998 was also up two to 92.76, or 7.24 percent.</p>
