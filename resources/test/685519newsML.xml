<p>Shares in South African firms in the Grinaker stable rose on Wednesday following a cautionary announcement which analysts said was likely to point to a restructure of the group's electronic interests.</p>
<p>Grinaker could not be reached for comment but sources close to the firm said that the earlier announcement was related to a further revamp of the group structure which began last year with the unbundling and listing of its construction interests.</p>
<p>"You would not be wrong to think it pertains to a further restructuring of the group. But you're also not completely right," the source said.</p>
<p>Another source said that an announcement was likely to be made within the next three weeks.</p>
<p>The cautionary on Wednesday said that Grinaker Holdings Ltd, its electronics subsidiary Grintek Ltd, Grintek unit Siltek Ltd and Siltek associate Q Data Ltd were in talks.</p>
<p>Analysts said that it was likely that the group could be streamlined through the removal of pyramid structures to give shareholders a direct stake in the underlying operating firms.</p>
<p>"It could be the unbundling and maybe a collapse of Grinaker Holdings or Grintek, or one of the two," said an analyst who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>"Ideally you do away with Grinaker Holdings as that is a pure pyramid. You can also do away with Grintek and basically take the electronics business currently in Grintek and put that into Siltek. So the shareholders, instead of holding Grinaker and Grintek, hold Siltek shares," the analyst said.</p>
<p>By 1250 GMT Grinaker shares on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange were up over five percent to 870 cents, Siltek gained 50 cents to 19.75 rand, Q Data jumped almost six per cent to 910 cents and Grintek added 15 cents to 350 cents.</p>
<p>Grinaker managing director Jack Saulez earlier this month said that the group planned to continue its unbundling, hoping to complete it within a year.</p>
<p>He said the unbundling and public offer last December of construction arm Grinaker Construction had been very successful and showed that "it will pay us to unbundle".</p>
<p>Originally announcing its plans to restructure last June, Grinaker said that over and above the plans for the construction side, it was also looking at the partial rationalisation of the pyramid structure of its electronic interests.</p>
<p>However, talks between Grinaker and Siltek were terminated two months later.</p>
<p>Analysts have welcomed the split in the business between construction and electronics, saying there was little rationale linking two very different industries in one firm.</p>
<p>Grinaker could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
