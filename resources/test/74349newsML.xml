<p>Dial Corp. said Wednesday it will cut 250 jobs and shed half of its outdated brands in an attempt to reap higher profits in the increasingly competitive household products market.</p>
<p>The maker of Dial soap, Purex detergents and Brillo scouring pads said the cuts were meant to save about $40 million a year.</p>
<p>"This decision was obviously a very painful one but it was neccesary to help ensure the future sucess of the total corporation," President Malcolm Jozoff said at a news conference at company headquarters here.</p>
<p>Dial said it will take a one-time writeoff of about $50 million in the third quarter to cover the costs associated with the changes.</p>
<p>The move is the latest in a series of restructurings at Dial, which recently spun off its travel services unit into a separate company called Viad Corp.</p>
<p>In a statement, Dial also said it expects 1996 earnings will be about 15 percent lower than most analysts had expected, due to slowness in new-product acceptance, as well as selected detergent and personal care programmes.</p>
<p>Jozoff said the changes, which were expected to reduce overhead costs by 20 percent, were the "crucial second step" in the firm's attempts to "keep our costs in line with the competition in a very price sensitive consumer marketplace."</p>
<p>The first step in that process came in August when Dial spun off Viad. Before that, Dial closed six of its U.S. manufacturing plants and cut nearly 700 jobs, mainly at the production plants. Management and corporate staff positions were virtually untouched during the cutback.</p>
<p>Of the 250 additional job cuts, about 80 percent are to come from management and administration, leaving Dial with about 2,800 employees, a 33 percent drop from 4,200 in 1990. Dial said it would notify affected employees Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dial said that while it plans to shed about half of its products, those lines only account for about 10 percent of the company's total sales volume.</p>
<p>"Most of the products we're eliminating are largely unknown to consumers," Jozoff said, adding that the products were "frankly no longer of interest to American consumers."</p>
<p>"These were once viable products, but consumer habits have changed," he said.</p>
<p>Jozoff said the company will focus its efforts on such core products as Dial soaps, Purex detergents, Armour Star food products and Renuzit air fresheners.</p>
<p>"It's important to note that every single one of Dial's competitors have already taken steps such as the ones we're announcing today," Jozoff said at the news conference.</p>
<p>Dial also said it plans to move from its present headquarters in a Phoenix office tower. The company is considering several metropolitan areas, including Phoenix, and expects to reach a decision by year end.</p>
<p>Dial stock added 12.5 cents to $13.125 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
