<p>Deputies of ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan People's Party (PPP) withdrew a no-confidence motion against reinstated Punjab chief minister Manzoor Wattoo on Saturday, sources said.</p>
<p>The move was part of complex political manoeuvring in Punjab, Pakistan's richest and most populous province.</p>
<p>The three other provincial assemblies were dissolved after President Farooq Leghari sacked Benazir Bhutto's government and dismissed the National Assembly (lower house) on November 5, saying corruption and misrule had paralysed the government.</p>
<p>Dissolution of the Punjab assembly has been held up by a tussle for control of the provincial government.</p>
<p>The Lahore High Court reinstated Wattoo on November 2 to the chagrin of the PPP, which had engineered the ouster of the chief minister last year after a party revolt against him.</p>
<p>Wattoo leads a breakaway faction of Nawaz Sharif's Pakistan Muslim League (PML), the main opposition to the PPP. Once a Sharif loyalist, he changed sides to enable the PPP to take control of Punjab, but the PPP later turned against him.</p>
<p>The Lahore High Court had told Wattoo to show that he commanded a majority in the 248-seat assembly, failing which his outgoing rival Arif Nakai would be automatically reinstated.</p>
<p>The PPP had tabled a no-confidence motion against Wattoo, but withdrew it on Saturday in an apparent attempt to prolong the life of the doomed assembly. The PML opposed the withdrawal of the no-confidence motion, but were outvoted.</p>
<p>Wattoo must now seek a vote of confidence on Sunday, but a source close to him said he might resign later on Saturday rather than face a humiliating defeat in the assembly.</p>
<p>"Since he is not in a position to take a confidence vote, he might resign for an honourable exit," the source said.</p>
<p>This would pave the way for the Punjab provincial governor to dissolve the assembly, following similar actions in Sindh, Balochistan and North West Frontier Province.</p>
<p>The PML leader in the Punjab assembly, Shahbaz Sharif, said he would submit the resignations of 97 deputies later on Saturday and accused the PPP of working against the federation.</p>
<p>"They want this assembly to continue when the three other provincial assemblies have already been dissolved," he said.</p>
<p>The caretaker federal government led by Meraj Khalid has promised to hold a general elections on February 3. Provincial assembly elections would normally take place a few days later.</p>
