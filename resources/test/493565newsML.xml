<p>Weekend frosts which hit Argentina's soybean crop and sent international prices rising Monday do not seem have to have done much damage, an analyst for Argentina's Cereals Elevators Association said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"They don't seem to have had much affect," the association's Armando Casalins said in an interview. "Flowering's already over. Pod filling's practically over."</p>
<p>But the crop was hard hit by dry weather early in the year, and he said the association expected output to total just a bit more than in 1995/96, when production was 12.4 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The Argentine government in mid-March reduced its soybean output forecast to 13.5 million tonnes from 13.9 million tonnes after dry weather.</p>
<p>But most in the industry say they think output will be 12.5 to 13.0 million tonnes.</p>
<p>But Casalins said the dry weather has helped the speed the maize harvest, which was about 70 to 80 percent complete.</p>
<p>He said he thought maize and sunflower seed output would be close the government's forecasts of 14.3 million tonnes and and 5.4 million tonnes, respectively.</p>
