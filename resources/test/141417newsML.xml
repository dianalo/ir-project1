<p>News Corp's plan to mortgage part of its stake in BSkyB by issuing a convertible preference share issue sent BSkyB shares sharply lower and roused the options market on Thursday, dealers said.</p>
<p>By 1341 GMT, nearly 2,200 lots had traded in BSkyB options in brisk two-way activity, they said.</p>
<p>While some of the trades were intended to protect BSkyB holdings, dealers said they suspected most of the trades were outright bets on a further drop in the share price or on an increase in volatility.  </p>
<p>Most of the volume in BSkyB options, more than 1,500 lots, was carried out on the put side. The most actively traded puts were the December 550 and December 650 contracts.</p>
<p>The shares were down 29-1/2p to 606-1/2p.</p>
<p>Trading in BSkyB options was light yesterday and on Tuesday, even as the underlying shares tumbled.</p>
<p>Activity in British Petroleum options was also active, with a 1,000 lot transaction in the January 600 puts and another 1,000 lot in the January 800 calls. More than 1,300 lots traded in British Petroleum options. The shares were down 13-1/2p to 67-1/2p after SBC Warburg downgraded the oil sector.</p>
