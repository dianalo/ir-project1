<p>Last February, Evergreen Media Corp. reformatted its WYNY-FM, the New York radio station it acquired in a May 1995 purchase from Broadcasting partners, and reintroduced it as WKTU-FM, a rhythmic, dance station.</p>
<p>In the first two months afterward, WKTU almost doubled the ratings of its predecessor station, increased its market share in what is probably the nation's most competitive radio market and poised itself high on the pecking order for ratings.</p>
<p>The move for Dallas-based Evergreen is one of the more dramatic examples of the new movement, wheeling-dealing and competitive race underway in the American radio industry.</p>
<p>Churning may be a more apt description.  In the second quarter of this year, some 700 American radio stations changed hands for a cool $7.6 billion price tag. This compares with $5.4 billion in radio deals for the entire year of 1995.</p>
<p>The merger mill ground even faster in July and August so that by the end of the year's first eight months 1,615 radio stations had been sold for some $11.9 billion.</p>
<p>And it wasn't just buying and selling for its own purpose. The new owners proved creative, with total radio advertising growing about 6 percent over the year before and average same-station advertising among public companies rising 8.4 percent over 1995.</p>
<p>What's going on is an industrywide momentum ignited by the Telecomunications Act passed in February. Aimed at altering the structure of radio ownership in the United States, the federal bill allows any radio company to merge with any other and also permits radio-station owners in the nation's top 10 markets to own eight stations with as many as five FM stations.</p>
<p>In the top 100 markets, one company can own six stations with a maximum of four FM's in contrast with the prior local limit of four stations and two FM's. The new statute also removes the national  ownership limit of 20 FM and 20 AM stations.</p>
<p>The freeing of ownership curbs has led to a scramble for deals, as companies move to control larger audiences to attract national advertising. A prime example of an industry mover in one of the top 10 markets is Evergreen Media, which, by a combination of its aggressiveness and the mobility provided by the new law, has become the third-largest radio group with 40 stations in 12 markets.</p>
<p>"The best-positioned radio groups in this looser, regulatory environment are those such as Evergreen that have a top-10 focus, control clusters of three or more FM's and already are bumping up against ownership limits, said Andrew W. Marcus of Alex Brown &amp; Sons, Baltimore.</p>
<p>Evergreen is outperming the industry on most key sales and earnings ratios, managing to quickly triple its size and gain a presence in each of the top 10 markets.</p>
<p>"The critical mass resulting from its extensive reach, and market dominance resulting from its highly-clustered strategy, reduce the company's sensitivity to fluctuations in station ratings and minimises its reliance on any single station or market," said John S. Reidy of Smith Barney, New York.</p>
<p>Chairman Scott K. Ginsburg spelled out Evergreen's growth credo after it acquired stations in San Francisco and Philadelphia last month. "Evergreen's acquisition strategy is focused on fortifying our presence and creating additional super-duopolies in the nation's largest radio revenue markets," he said.</p>
<p>Whether Evergreen is coming to a halt in its acquisition drive is not clear but, at the same time, there are some unconfirmed reports that the company itself is being eyed as a takeover target.</p>
<p>Are these any roadblocks to the radio-business push for growth? One possible risk, as Andrew Marcus of Alex Brown sees it, is that the industry could suffer an unexpected advertising recession. As far as Evergreen itself is concerned, the hot Dallas broadcaster could run into a deceleration of its positive ratings momentum, he says, or make a bad acquisition.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in the meantime, it is riding high and broadcasting to beat the band.</p>
