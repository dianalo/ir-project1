<p>The Serbian opposition has scored a major victory in its campaign to restore results of annulled municipal elections but said a two-month protest campaign would continue.</p>
<p>Electoral officials in the capital overruled a district court to award victory on Tuesday to the opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition in the Belgrade assembly. Zajedno confirmed a court in Nis, Serbia's second biggest city, had made a similar ruling to return full control to Zajedno there.</p>
<p>The decisions, which won cautious support even from hardline leftist parties backing President Slobodan Milosevic, came a day after the opposition drew a crowd of up to half a million to Belgrade for an Orthodox New Year's Eve rally.</p>
<p>The demonstration was the biggest in two months of constant protests by Zajedno and students to overturn the annulment of November 17 elections in which Zajedno candidates won majorities in 14 of Serbia's 18 biggest cities.</p>
<p>Zajedno reacted cautiously to the electoral decisions, saying they were awaiting final verification of the election results. The coalition said it wanted their victories restored in all 18 cities and that protests would continue.</p>
<p>Students who have run a parallel protest campaign backing Zajedno's main demands also said they would continue demonstrating.</p>
<p>"Regardless of the regime's recognition of the electoral will of the people of Belgrade and Nis today, the 1996/97 student protest will not halt its activities," the students said in a fax sent to news agencies.</p>
<p>"We shall continue our protests until the full electoral will of the people expressed on November 17 last year is recognised and those responsible be brought to trial."</p>
<p>The students also are demanding that the rector of Belgrade University be replaced.</p>
<p>Washington applauded the concessions but said the United States would remain sceptical until the opposition took over the city council in Belgrade.</p>
<p>"This appears to be a step in the right direction," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said. "However, the United States will withhold final judgment...until we can see that this result is actually implemented."</p>
<p>The rulings made strange bedfellows of bitter rivals on the fractious Serbian political scene. Even the hardline leftist Yugoslav United Left (JUL) headed by Milosevic's wife said the electoral decisions were in accordance with the rule of law.</p>
<p>The strains within Serbia's ruling Socialist coalition were underscored by the expulsions of two prominent Socialist Party (SPS) members, hardline Nis party chief Mile Ilic and moderate Belgrade mayor Nebojsa Covic.</p>
<p>A statement carried by the state-run Tanjug news agency said Ilic was being expelled "as he bears most of the responsibility for the situation in Nis".</p>
<p>Covic, who had backed Zajedno demands, was expelled because of his conflicts with Branislav Ikovic, the chief of Belgrade Socialists, who was displaced as a member of the SPS executive board, the statement said.</p>
