<p>A passion for pizza got the better of a fugitive jailbird who flew back to Italy for a bite of his favourite bake and got arrested.</p>
<p>Police at Rome's Fiumicino airport said Vincenzo Esposito was captured during passport checks when the plane he had taken from Madrid landed on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Esposito, 44, fled Italy two years ago after a court sentenced him to six years and three months in jail for aggravated robbery.</p>
<p>Asked by police why he had come back, Esposito told them he had missed his family and the pizzas in Naples, his hometown and the cradle of Italy's most famous fast food.</p>
