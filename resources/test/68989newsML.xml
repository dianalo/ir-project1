<p>A prolonged emergency triggered by North Korean infiltrators who landed on a beach near South Korea's east coast city of Kangnung has drastically cut regional business income, city officials and residents said on Saturday.</p>
<p>"We have received a lot of complaints from the residents in this region, mostly fishermen and farmers, in connection with the guerrilla incident," Kim Kil-hyon, a spokesman for the Kangnung city government told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>"They are biting their nails ahead of Chusok holidays," he said, referring to the Korean Thanksgiving, the most important holiday, which lasts for four days starting from next Thursday.</p>
<p>Kim said city authorities have yet to calculate exact losses stemming from the incident, which began on Wednesday when around 26 North Korean infiltrators came ashore from a submarine. On Saturday a small group of the infiltrators was still at large.</p>
<p>Squid-fishing housholds in the Kangnung area appeared to be suffering a combined daily income loss of about 800 million won ($975,000) since authorities have prohibited fishing boats from leaving ports, Kim said.</p>
<p>He said September was a big season for catching squid in the country.</p>
<p>Since the infiltration, authorities have imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the region, an action that has also upset owners of night-time entertainment places.</p>
<p>The curfew has left guest rooms at most accommodation facilities for tourists in the mountainous area almost empty.</p>
<p>Nearby Sorak Mountain is one of the country's best-known resort areas, frequented by millions of South Korean climbers, skiers and other tourists throughout the year.</p>
<p>"Our room occupancy rate has fallen by about 30 percent -- compared with that in the same period of last year -- apparently affected by the infiltration incident," said Kim Gwang-yon, manager of a hotel located on the foot of Sorak.</p>
<p>"There have been many telephone calls from customers to cancel their reservations made for Chusok," he said.</p>
<p>The Kangnung city official said the incident has also seriously damaged mushroom harvesting in the area. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>The Korea Times daily said a one-kg (2.2 lb) carton of champignon mushrooms is now selling for as much as 120,000 won ($146). The mushrooms are in high demand as gifts on the occasion of Chusok.</p>
<p>It said farmers, who used to pick four kg (8.8 lb) of champignon per day before the incident, make much less since they have been banned from entering mountains in the region.</p>
<p>Another Kangnung official said there has been an outcry from residents demanding that city authorities take steps so they can resume their work.</p>
<p>Since the infiltration, terrified local residents have been bolting their doors at night and some have even been doing so during the day.</p>
<p>"We spend everyday in a helpless situation," said Chon Song-hee, a female resident at a town on the outskirts of Kangnung. "I feel like I live in the dark. I don't go out even during the daytime."</p>
<p>So far 18 of the North Korean infiltrators have been shot and killed. Another was captured alive. During a helicopter chase on Saturday, one South Korean paratrooper was shot in the head and died in hospital.</p>
