<p>The United States, in the first major trade policy statement since President Clinton's re-election, Monday issued a ringing statement of commitment to open markets and the rules of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>The statement was delivered by Deputy Trade Representative Jeffrey Lang to envoys from many of the 125 countries now in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) at a session focused on U.S. trade policies.</p>
<p>Diplomats said some representatives at the session voiced strong criticism of Washington.</p>
<p>"The openness of our market and the increasing openness of foreign markets have undoubtedly contributed to the growth of U.S. trade and the overall robust health of the U.S. economy in recent years," Lang said.</p>
<p>"Our commitment to an increasingly open multilateral trading system and U.S. market, in fact, are anchored in our faith in the domestic economic benefits promoted by trade liberalisation."</p>
<p>"Our perspective is firmly grounded in the belief that only by pursuing open markets, both at home and abroad, can the United States continue to be so prosperous," he said.</p>
<p>"But the pursuit of our national interest in open markets reflects our profound belief that open global markets benefit all trade partners."</p>
<p>All countries benefit together from better use of national resources, Lang said.</p>
<p>The two-day session was called to discuss a report by analysts in the two-year-old body's Secretariat on the U.S. role on the world trade scene, part of a series of individual studies of the policies all WTO members.</p>
<p>The survey of the United States, the world's largest trading nation in imports and exports of goods and services, is widely awaited. The report, which comes around every two years for the big powers, will be publicly released Tuesday.</p>
<p>Since Clinton won a second four-year term in the White House Nov. 5, U.S. officials have said there will be no change in trade policy -- although there have been signs of an effort to achieve closer cooperation with the European Union, the No. 2 global trade power.</p>
<p>Many trading partners have been alarmed by Clinton's endorsement of efforts to limit foreign investment in Cuba, Iran and Libya, while developing countries are critical of U.S. treatment of their textile and clothing exports.</p>
<p>The U.S. administration, facing alarm among unions at what they see as an inevitable loss of jobs as production moves to low-wage countries under the open markets policy, is pushing for the WTO to link trade and labour conditions.</p>
<p>There is strong opposition to the measure from Third World countries.</p>
<p>Lang, deputy to Acting Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, said the United States has been "a leader in opening up its domestic market to increased access and increased competition."</p>
<p>It has some of the lowest tariff rates in the world, allowed a large range of commodities -- mainly from middle-income countries and the poorest -- into the country duty-free, and was opening up its telecommunications market.</p>
<p>The United States has also sought to resolve trade disputes through the WTO's dispute settlement procedure -- under which neutral panels review complaints and bring in enforceable findings on whether the body's rules are being violated.</p>
<p>"The U.S. government ... is strongly committed to making the World Trade Organisation the centrepiece of multilateral, open market disciplines," Lang said.</p>
