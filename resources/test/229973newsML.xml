<p>Malaysia's tin price fell eight cents to 14.99 ringgit ($5.93) a kg despite a rise on the London Metal Exchange (LME) on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>"There were high initial offerings as many players thought the market will go up after the higher LME," said a trader. "Although they withdrew later, the price still closed lower."</p>
<p>There were offers for 101 tonnes against bids of 61, leading to a turnover of 75 tonnes against 97 on Friday. The local price was trading at a discount of $30 against London, compared to a premium of $40 on Friday.</p>
