<p>Former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani on Friday used his first major public speech since stepping down to blast the United States for provoking a security crisis in the Middle East.</p>
<p>He also ridiculed Washington for trying vainly to impose sanctions on Tehran, slammed it for trying to hamper Iran's ties with its Arab neighbours and denounced it for claiming that Iran wanted nuclear weapons, a charge Tehran denies.</p>
<p>Speaking at a mass prayer meeting at Tehran University, Rafsanjani said Washington had no credibility in the peace process because it insisted that Israel's security and not Palestinian rights was the basis of any peace settlement.</p>
<p>"You do not believe in peace and are violating past agreements signed by the presidents of America, Russia and others as mediators and blame everything on the innocent people of Palestine," Rafsanjani told a crowd of several thousand.</p>
<p>Washington's reaction to the suicide bomb attack in a Jerusalem market last week and to the building of new Jewish housing showed how the U.S. ignored Palestinian rights, he said.</p>
<p>"Suddenly they (U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeline Albright) announced that the first principle in the peace negotiations is Israel's security and thus any resistance by the Palestinian nation is regarded as being against peace," Rafsanjani said in a speech carried on state radio and by megaphones through neighbouring streets.</p>
<p>The veteran revolutionary cleric said Jewish housing projects were a "provocation" which Moslems and Arabs would resist.</p>
<p>The crowd, gathered on a hot summer day in central Tehran, chanted "Death to America," but the event was one of calm with families arriving on coaches and walking a few blocks through sealed roads to the university campus.</p>
<p>U.S. sanctions against Iran had failed though Washington was still bent on this policy, Rafsanjani said.</p>
<p>"All of America's efforts against us have been like the sound of a mosquito buzzing in our ear...they did not affect us at all," Rafsanjani told his audience, in which men and women were segregated by blue canvas screens.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani also ridiculed Washington's latest attempt to toughen sanctions by reducing the amount that non-U.S. firms could invest in Iran's oil and gas industry before being penalised by U.S. sanctions.</p>
<p>"America is showing its real nature by intensifying sanctions against Iran through lowering the ceiling from $40 million to $20 million, despite the rumours in recent days America was going to change its policy towards Iran," he said.</p>
<p>The U.S. State Department said on Wednesday that under the terms of the 1996 Iran Libya Sanctions Act, the U.S. must now punish firms that spend $20 million or more a year on developing Tehran's oil and gas deposits.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani said that Washington had tricked its oil-rich allies in the Gulf into buying unnecessary U.S. arms by falsely portraying Iran and Iraq as military threats.</p>
<p>"Americans exploited Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and they have polluted the Persian Gulf waters ever since...Our Arab brothers were deceived by America who demonised Iran or Iraq," he said.</p>
<p>"The powers that created such disasters (atomic bombings) are now accusing Iran of trying to acquire nuclear arms and say Iran should be deprived of everything," he added, referring to the anniversary this week of the atomic bombing of Japan in 1945.</p>
<p>Rafsanjani stepped down as president this month after serving the maximum two four-year terms permitted under the constitution. But he is expected to remain a powerful political figure during the new administration.</p>
<p>His successor is Mohammad Khatami, a 54-year-old moderate Shi'ite cleric, who sealed his landslide election victory of last May when he was sworn in on Monday as the Islamic republic's fifth president since the 1979 revolution.</p>
<p>Speculation has grown since Khatami's election that ties between Tehran and Washington could improve, though analysts do not predict any major or rapid changes as Iranian foreign policy remains in the hands of supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has rejected the possibility of a thaw in relations.</p>
