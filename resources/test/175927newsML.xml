<p>President Boris Yeltsin left Moscow's Cardiology Research Centre on Friday, moving to another hospital to continue his recovery from the quintuple heart bypass operation he underwent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin told Itar-Tass news agency Yeltsin had been transferred to the more comfortable surroundings of Moscow's elite Central Clinical Hospital.</p>
<p>"Now the president is gaining strength very quickly," Chernomyrdin said. The main task of those around him was to "save him from overload".</p>
<p>Television crews saw Yeltsin's motorcade, including his stretch Mercedes limousine, moving down a closed-off road in Moscow's western suburbs between the two hospitals.</p>
<p>The presidential press service said Yeltsin was in satisfactory condition after the transfer, which was authorised by his doctors at an early morning meeting.</p>
<p>Doctors said his circulation, temperature, pulse and blood pressure were all normal and Yeltsin's movements would gradually be increased.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, was out of bed and walking on Thursday. He has been visited by Chernomyrdin, by his chief of staff Anatoly Chubais and by members of his family. No further appointments were scheduled for Friday.</p>
<p>The next stage in presenting his recovery to the Russian people is likely to be a radio or television address from the hospital.</p>
<p>Renat Akchurin, the Russian surgeon who led the operating team, told NTV television on Thursday Yeltsin was recovering ahead of schedule and could be ready to talk in public as early as Friday or Saturday.</p>
<p>In less than a fortnight, Yeltsin could be carrying out most of his presidential duties although doctors say he will have to avoid straining himself too quickly and may need up to a couple of months for a full convalescence.</p>
<p>"I think that somewhere around 10 to 12 days after the operation he could quite easily fulfil the major part of his duties," Akchurin told NTV.</p>
<p>"You're going to see a vigorous leader," Michael DeBakey, the pioneering U.S. surgeon who advised on the surgery, said after meeting Yeltsin on Thursday, adding that the president had heeded doctors' pleas to stay another day in the emergency room.</p>
<p>DeBakey also said the presidential liver did not bear the tell-tale marks of heavy drinking, which Yeltsin has, despite repeated Kremlin denials, been reputed to indulge in.</p>
<p>In fact, the 88-year-old Texan doctor said, the president could even allow himself the odd booze binge if he wanted. But he will have to cut down on fatty Russian sausages.</p>
<p>Sidelined by heart trouble since his reelection in July, Yeltsin seems to have come out of the operating theatre with a renewed appetite for power and politics.</p>
<p>Announcing his return to the fray, he issued a statement on Thursday calling for national unity and reconciliation as his communist opponents marched in cities across the country to mark the 79th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution.</p>
<p>He issued a decree renaming the November 7 Revolution Day holiday. It is now the Day of Accord and Reconciliation.</p>
<p>Yeltsin hopes the heart surgery will not only save him from a lingering death but inject new life into his presidency -- he won a new four-year term in July -- and let him to push on with the reforms Russia needs after the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>"We are one nation. We have one fate, one future," he said. "We have one Russia and we must be together."</p>
<p>Because of his absence from the Kremlin since his re-election, Yeltsin's second term has been overshadowed by Kremlin infighting and drift over policy.</p>
