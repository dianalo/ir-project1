<p>The rupee closed at 35.8150/8250 against the dollar in lacklustre trade on Monday, up compared to 35.83/84 opening, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the market was swinging back to the earlier mood of dollar oversupply and suppressed demand.</p>
<p>The market opened at 35.83/84, the level at which the rupee closed against the dollar on Friday.</p>
<p>"It was basically short-covering on Friday," said a dealer, referring to Bank of Baroda's unexpected demand which dragged the rupee to a low of 35.86/87 on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The market was oversold," he said.</p>
<p>The usual weekend remittances on Monday pushed the rupee to the 35.81 level when the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) entered the market and made "token" purchases, dealers said.</p>
<p>But the spot dollar soon reverted to the 35.81/82 level against the backdrop of abundant dollar supply.</p>
<p>"The market has factored the oil price hike," said the chief dealer at a foreign bank, referring to a long-debated hike in petroleum product prices.</p>
<p>"Whatever will be announced will be a watered-down version," he said, alluding to opposition to the price hike by Left parties that are supporting the ruling United Fronto government.</p>
<p>The market is looking to the price hike which will generate fresh rupee revenues for oil firms, enabling them to buy dollars from the market, helping correct an overvalued rupee.</p>
<p>The forward dollar market saw some mild paying interest (banks paying premiums to buy forward dollars), helping the six month annualised premium to close at 4.25 percent compared with Friday's close of 4.21 percent, dealers said.</p>
