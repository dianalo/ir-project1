<p>An unexpected rate cut by Taiwan's central bank will not be strong enough to cure the ailing "Asian dragon" economy but should improve confidence in the local stock market, analysts said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Inspired by Friday's rate cut, the island's stock index soared 1.79 percent at the opening on Saturday but lost steam to finish down 9.66 points or 0.16 percent at 6,190.56 in a late flurry of profit-taking.</p>
<p>The central bank's trimming of its reserve requirements for domestic banks by up to 0.5 percentage points, effective from Saturday, was aimed at pumping T$25 billion ($900 million) into the island's sluggish economy.</p>
<p>"The rate cut significantly boosts investors' confidence. People feel the government will do everything to boost the slow economy," said Lin Long-hsien, an assistant manager at broker United Securities.</p>
<p>Tsao Chung-ping, a manager at Ting Kong Securities, agreed.</p>
<p>"The surprise rate cut is definitely bullish news to investors and the market will continue to reflect the news in coming sessions," Tsao said</p>
<p>The market had been hoping for a rate cut, although analysts said the move had not been expected before the central bank's September 12 board meeting.</p>
<p>Tsao said Friday's rate cut was "only a beginning of a string of measures" by the government to spur the economy, adding that he expected the central bank to further loosen monetary policy in September.</p>
<p>But economists said the central bank's medicine may not be enough to cure fundamental problems in Taiwan's economy, noting that it targeted an increase in bank liquidity while a worsening investment climate was hurting business conditions.</p>
<p>"The fundamental solution to revive the economy is to improve the entire investment climate," said Wu Hui-lin, research fellow at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research.</p>
<p>Friday's reduction in reserve requirements marked the fifth such rate cut by the central bank in the past 12 months and analysts said the central bank was losing its bargaining chips.</p>
<p>"Adopting a short-term stimulus policy is like taking a painkiller...it will not help economic development," Wu said.</p>
<p>Analysts have attributed Taiwan's economic slowdown to various factors including delays in public construction projects and a lack of willingness to invest at home.</p>
<p>The Commercial Times, one of Taiwan's leading business newspapers, said in a commentary on Saturday: "The current economic slowdown is not a result of lacking resources...it's not a war the central bank can fight alone."</p>
<p>The island's economic output, or gross domestic product (GDP), grew only 5.42 percent annually in the second quarter against a revised 5.12 percent in the first, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said on Friday.</p>
<p>The bureau revised its forecast for the 1996 gross domestic product to 5.89 percent, well below an prediction of 6.17 percent issued three months ago.</p>
<p>Other economic figures were equally disappointing.</p>
<p>Taiwan's jobless rate inched up to a 10-year high of 2.97 percent in July and was seen likely to move even higher in August before flattening.</p>
<p>The broadest money supply measure, M2, grew 8.47 percent in July, below the central bank's target zone of 9-14 percent.</p>
<p>But economics minister Wang Chih-kang on Saturday vowed to bring the island's annual economic growth to 6.0 percent this year by taking measures to spur investment by local manufacturers foreign investors in the economy.</p>
