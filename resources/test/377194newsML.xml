<p>Indonesia's state-owned oil company Pertamina will resume operations at its Balongan 83,000-barrel-per-day long residue catalytic cracker later on Thursday after an unexpected shutdown on February 6, sources close to the refinery said on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The source said Pertamina was hoping to successfully restart the unit later Thursday but was not able to confirm if the unit was already operational.</p>
<p>Pertamina had shutdown the cracker in November for a 60-day scheduled maintenance while the crude unit was closed at the same time for a shorter 30-day period.</p>
<p>The company will close its 125,000-bpd Dumai crude unit in mid-February for maintenance as scheduled earlier. Sources said the company had earlier this week closed a 27,500-bpd hydrocracker ahead of the crude unit's closure.</p>
