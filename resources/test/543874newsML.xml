<p>Yemen reported a high voter turnout in the country's first parliamentary elections since a 1994 civil war, but two fatal shootings in which nine people died overshadowed Sunday's polling.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Sanaa appeared calm on Monday as military police armed with AK-47 assault rifles manned polling stations while votes were counted.</p>
<p>The Minister of Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Abdullah Ahmad Ghanem said first results were expected on Monday afternoon, but election observers said vote counting was extremely slow.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Supreme Election Committee announced an 80 percent voter turnout, but international monitors believed it was closer to 60 percent.</p>
<p>Before voting began, a soldier started shooting at people randomly at a polling station in the town of Mukayras, killing five soldiers and three civilians, Interior Minister Hussein Mohammad Arab said.</p>
<p>Arab said security officials were investigating the incident but no political motive had been established. "We were expecting more incidents because some are discontented with holding general elections in Yemen," he said. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>He said one of the victims of the first attack was a member of Yemen's ruling party, the General Peoples Congress (GPC).</p>
<p>Also on Sunday, a man who was refused access to a polling station in Dhamar, 100 km (60 miles) south of Sanaa, fired on a security officer who died after the attack, an election observer said.</p>
<p>The incidents raised to four the number of election-related fatal attacks. A man was killed when clashes broke out between supporters of the GPC and its junior coalition partner, the Islamist Islah Party, in Ibb on April 20 and a child was killed in Taiz on Thursday when gunmen opened fire on a GPC rally.</p>
<p>Election observers said the violence was not surprising as many Yemenis routinely carry AK-47s and other weapons.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of ongoing tribal violence that has nothing to do with the elections," an election monitor said. "A lot of people carry arms, whether they are wearing grenade belts or they have Kalashnikovs."</p>
<p>Another observer said family clashes in the Dhamar and Marib area left two people dead on Sunday. Violence erupted after members of feuding families had voted, but it was apparently unrelated to the election, the observer said.</p>
<p>One election observer said the voting and counting process seemed free of violations in several polling stations visited.</p>
<p>Western diplomats expect President Ali Abdullah Saleh's GPC and its Islamist junior coalition partner, the Islah Party, to retain power.</p>
<p>The main opposition Yemen Socialist Party, some of whose former leaders launched the separatist campaign that sparked civil war, and three others boycotted the polls due to alleged irregularities. The government denied the charges.</p>
<p>Diplomats say they were encouraged by Yemen's democratic experiment, but add that power ultimately rests with the president, his appointed ministers, and military and security forces loyal to the GPC.</p>
<p>A total of 2,306 candidates, including 17 women, stood for the 301 parliamentary seats, either under the banner of 12 parties or as independents.</p>
<p>Diplomats said the government hoped to boost its democratic image and provide the political stability needed to attract foreign investment and aid to the impoverished Arab state, a small oil producer.</p>
