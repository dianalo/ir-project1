<title>LUXEMBOURG: Court says Belgium impeding free movement of EU workers.</title>
<headline>Court says Belgium impeding free movement of EU workers.</headline>
<dateline>LUXEMBOURG 1997-02-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>The European Court of Justice said on Thursday Belgium's practice of charging member state nationals for multiple residency documents violates Community law.</p>
<p>The court also found that Belgian law, which expels persons unable to find work within three months after applying for a residency permit, violates the fundamental freedom of European Union citizens to move and establish throughout the Community.</p>
<p>Belgium said it was in the process of extending the three month period to assist job-seekers and that it intends to reduce the number of registration certificates required for workers during their first six months residency from two to one.</p>
<p>Additionally, the court found that workers who remain in Belgium for three months or less should not be required to obtain a residency document. The court said the "worker's authorisation to remain arises from the document with which he entered the territory and from a statement by the employer on the expected duration of the empoyment."</p>
<p>Council directive 68/360/EEC, article 8(1)(c) allows a worker to remain in any member state for three months with a letter from his employer stamped by the competent authority of the member state where the temporary work will occur, the court said.</p>

<p>EXCERPTS FROM THE JUDGMENT</p>
<p>(Court translation into English. Original language of the case: French)</p>
<p>THE COURT hereby</p>
<p>1. Declares that</p>
<p>- by requiring nationals of other member states who are seeeking employment in Belgium to leave its territory after a period of three months;</p>
<p>- by issuing, during the first six months of their residence, to persons holding employment for a period of at least one year two successive registration certificates instead of a residence permit for a national of a member state and by requiring payment for those certificates;</p>
<p>- by issuing to employed persons and to seasonal workers whose activity is expected to last for no more than three months a document relating to their residence and by requiring payment for that document;</p>
<p>the Kingdom of Belgium has failed to fulfil its obligations under article 49 of the EC Treaty and under Council directive 68/360/EEC of 15 October 1968 on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for workers of member states and their families.</p>
