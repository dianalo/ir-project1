<p>President Boris Yeltsin on Saturday pledged to promote reforms and human rights in Belarus and told Russians they would not be harmed by a Union Treaty he signed last week with their western neighbours.</p>
<p>"We will not step back in order to be on a level with our ally and partner," Yeltsin said in a nationwide radio address. "We will do everything to make democratic values, freedom of speech and the media a common achievement of the Union."  </p>
<p>Yeltsin at the last minute sharply scaled back the treaty he signed with Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko on Wednesday after Russian liberals had expressed fears integration was going too fast and that hard-line Lukashenko could get too big a role.</p>
<p>"It is the beginning of the path to unity, and not its end," Yeltsin said, stressing that the treaty and accompanying memorandum constituted no more than a basis for further discussion.</p>
<p>"I will not hide that some politicians thought it would be possible, having signed the Treaty and memorandum, to present our peoples with a fait accompli. That is wrong. Russians should all have the chance to have their say in the making of such an important decision," he said.</p>
