<p>An anonymous buyer on Friday paid a record 5.3 million pounds ($8.8 million) for a sketch by Raphael, the Italian 16th-century Old Master, a spokeswoman for London auctioneers Christie's said.</p>
<p>Raphael produced the "Study for the Head and Hand of an Apostle" as part of his work on the figure of St John the Evangelist in "Transfiguration", the outstanding masterpiece of the artist's later years.</p>
<p>When the drawing was last sold 12 years ago at Christie's, it fetched a record price for the time as well.</p>
<p>"We were thrilled to have it back to sell again," the spokeswoman said.</p>
