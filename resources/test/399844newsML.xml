<title>JAPAN: One-time copper king Hamanaka free on bail.</title>
<headline>One-time copper king Hamanaka free on bail.</headline>

<p>Just a week after he pleaded guilty to his role in the biggest trading scandal in history, Yasuo Hamanaka, once the "king" of international copper trading, walked out of jail Monday after posting bail of 50 million yen ($409,000).</p>
<p>Hamanaka, 49, pleaded guilty to fraud and forgery in connection with unauthorised trades over a decade that cost his former employer, Sumitomo Corp., $2.6 billion.</p>
<p>Despite pleading guilty at the opening of his trial Feb. 17, Hamanaka still has further court hearings, with the next scheduled for March 10.</p>
<p>Justice Ministry sources said that since Hamanaka had acknowledged his guilt, the court likely concluded there was no reason to believe he would either try to destroy evidence or attempt to flee Japan to avoid serving a prison term.</p>
<p>The two counts carry a penalty of up to 15 years in prison, although Hamanaka's lawyers plan to introduce evidence that shows Hamanaka was not completely to blame for the massive losses.</p>
<p>Hamanaka's trading activities, which earned him the name "Mr. Five Percent" for the control he wielded, are also under investigation by regulators in both Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Traders over the years have claimed that Hamanaka kept copper prices artificially high through skilful use of complex derivatives transactions and through his iron grip on a large portion of the copper stocks in London Metal Exchange warehouses.</p>
<p>He was fired by Sumitomo, where he had spent his entire professional life, last June when the company said it discovered his long trail of unauthorised trading.</p>
<p>The prosecution contends that Hamanaka had started to lose money in the volatile copper market in 1985 and then tried to cover up the losses.</p>
<p>However, Japan contends that since the trades took place overseas, they are not involved in trying to determine if Hamanaka or Sumitomo had tried to manipulate the world copper market.</p>
