<p>Cincinnati Milacron Inc said Tuesday that it expects steady sales and earnings growth for the rest of 1997 and into 1998.</p>
<p>Cincinnati Milacron reported second quarter earnings of $0.45 a share on sales of $452 million, compared to $0.40 a share on sales of $411 million the previous second quarter.</p>
<p>The company said that it expects pricing pressure to continue in its plastics machinery segment's injection molding businesses both in North America and Europe.</p>
<p>However, due to recently implemented productivity enhancements and cost-reduction measures, the company looks for gradual improvement in these businesses as the year progresses, it said.</p>
<p>Second quarter sales for the company's plastics machinery segment were $179 million, up 13 percent over the year before.</p>
<p>Milacron said the machine tool group remains on track for "substantial" improvements in sales, orders and operating profit in 1997 and said it expects continued gains in sales and earnings in the industrial products segment in the second half.</p>
<p>In the scond quarter, machine tools sales rose 21 percent to $105 million and industrial products sales rose to $168 million from $167 million the year before.</p>
<p>"We believe these good business levels will continue for the balance of the year," said Daniel Myer, chief executive officer in a press release.</p>
<p>"The eventual recovery in Europe should hold significant upside potential for us.  But, regardless of the timing of that turnaround, we expect steady sales and earnings growth for the rest of 1997 and into 1998," he said.</p>
