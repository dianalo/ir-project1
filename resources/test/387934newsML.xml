<p>Mongolia wants to take another step away from more than seven decades of dependence on its big neighbour, Russia. It wants to process its own copper.</p>
<p>Raw copper is the biggest single export from this land-locked nation, which is three times the size of France but has just 2.3 million people.</p>
<p>But with doubt hanging over the capacity of the copper industry to maintain profits, the Ministry of Agriculture and Industry wants to build a plant to process at least half of Mongolia's raw copper at home by the end of the century.</p>
<p>Domestic production is essential to ensure a profit and to cut costs as the percentage of raw copper concentrate mined in Mongolia has fallen, officials said.</p>
<p>"We have an immediate need to get a plant where 50 to 60 percent of concentrate we produce can be processed into copper," T. Battseren, deputy director of the ministry's mining department, said.</p>
<p>He said he wanted to see a plant in operation by 2000.</p>
<p>Currently, all copper concentrate is sent to Russian refineries from the huge Erdenet mine, Mongolia's only mine and a joint venture with Russia.</p>
<p>In 1996, Mongolia exported 486,100 metric tons of copper concentrate from the mine, up from 446,200 tons in 1995. That included some concentrate taken from stockpiles both years as its total production in 1996 was just 351,500 tons, up from 346,400 tons the previous year.</p>
<p>The amount of concentrate mined was expected to increase while annual production of pure copper would remain steady at about 121,000 metric tons, Battseren said.</p>
<p>The Erdenet mine in northern Mongolia, where the percentage of copper declines as mining goes deeper, holds reserves for another 50 to 60 years at current production levels, Battseren said.</p>
<p>Mongolia has found more copper in its Central Gobi province, but the government has no plans to exploit the deposit, about one-fifth the size of Erdenet, he said.</p>
<p>The mine needs foreign investment and technology to develop large-scale domestic processing, a proposal under discussion with several foreign companies including Outokumpu of Finland, he said, but declined to identify the other firms.</p>
<p>"Outokumpu seems to be the closest partner and the most realistic," he said, adding the biggest problems are financing for a plant and updating ageing equipment at the mine.</p>
<p>"To prevent production falling, we need investment of $240 million," Battseren said.</p>
<p>Mongolia is also discussing the investment with its Russian mining partners, but has yet to reach a final decision.</p>
<p>Currently, production costs at the mine account for 60 percent of revenue while taxes, customs duties and other costs take up some of the remaining 40 percent, he said.</p>
<p>"However, last year actual profit was more than 10 billion tugriks ($13.9 million)," Battseren said.</p>
<p>Profit is divided between the joint venture mining partners on the basis of equity, with 51 percent going to Mongolia and 49 percent to Russia.</p>
<p>Revenues could soar if Mongolia could refine at least some of the copper domestically, Battseren said.</p>
<p>A U.S.-Mongolia joint venture processing plant, Erdmin, is expected to start production at the Erdenet mine in the first quarter of this year, with output at 3,000 to 3,600 tons a year.</p>
<p>However, operations are limited by infrastructure problems such as power shortages, although once-regular black-outs had declined in the past six months.</p>
