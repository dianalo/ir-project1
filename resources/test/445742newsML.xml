<p>Dutch brewer Heineken NV has reached an accord with the controlling shareholders of Tempo Beer Industries to acquire at least 51 percent of the Israeli company, Tempo said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The two sides also agreed to break up Tempo, which makes beer and soft drinks, into two publicly traded companies along product lines, Tempo managing director Yaki Vadmani said.</p>
<p>"On March 13, 1997 a letter of intent was signed by the Heineken group and the Bar-Bornstein group concerning the readiness of Heineken to acquire more than 51 percent of the issued share capital of Tempo Beer Industries," Tempo said in a statement of the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE).</p>
<p>"After the break-up, Heineken will retain control of the beer company alone," the statement said, adding that the split is subject to approval by Israel's tax commissioner.</p>
<p>The agreement comes after the Bar-Bornstein group, which already holds 51 percent of Tempo, agreed on February 3 to acquire a 44.5 percent stake controlled by the rival Podhorzer group for $42 million.</p>
<p>The acquisition, in the form of a 90-day option, is contingent on Bar-Bronstein winning Heineken's consent to buying the shares.</p>
<p>Tempo manufactures under license and imports Heineken beers.</p>
<p>Vadmani would not provide any details beyond what was in the TASE statement nor would he confirm newspaper reports that Heineken would buy shares at less than the $96 million valuation the Bar-Borenstein group was paying.</p>
<p>The announcement did not specify how much of the brewing business Heineken would hold. Tempo does not break down revenues or earnings for its two product lines, but industry sources said the beer businsess accounted for at least 60 percent to 70 percent of total revenues.</p>
<p>Most of Tempo's soft drink products are produced under license from PepsiCo Inc, but Tempo's soft drinks business has been sluggish in recent years.</p>
