<p>Swedish appliance maker AB Electrolux Thursday launched a two-year restructuring that will include closing about 25 plants and cutting 12,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Electrolux said it expected restructuring costs of about 2.5 billion crowns ($321.6 million), which will be charged completely against its operating income in the second quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>It said the costs would be partly offset by a capital gain of about 600 million crowns ($77 million) from the divestment of Husqvarana Sewing Machines in the second quarter.</p>
<p>"In order to achieve the group's long-term financial goals, (that is) an operating margin of 6.5 to 7.0 percent, and a return of equity of 15 percent, the board of directors of AB Electrolux has authorised a restructuring programme," Electrolux said.</p>
<p>It said it currently employs about 105,000 people at about 150 plants.</p>
<p>Electrolux was to hold a news conference in Stockholm Thursday afternoon to discuss further details of the move.</p>
