<p>The declining security situation in Zaire has forced a further cut in American staff at the United States embassy in Kinshasa to 25 from 37, diplomats said on Monday.</p>
<p>"It is one of a series of steps given the prevailing insecurity in Kinshasa," one U.S. diplomat in the region said. He said the departing staff would leave on Monday.</p>
<p>Staff at the embassy have been progressively cut back from more than 50 as Laurent Kabila's rebels have advanced towards the city of five million in their war to overthrow President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>Most families and dependents of the staff remaining at the embassy have already left, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Rebels were last reported to be 200 km (125 miles) from Kinshasa. On Monday they said they were advancing towards the city and expected it to fall in "the next few days".</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Bill Richardson, who was in Zaire last week to try to help ease control of the country from Mobutu, said on Sunday he did not feel international citizens in Kinshasa were in serious danger.</p>
<p>A contingent of U.S. marines based in the the Congo capital Brazzaville, three km (two miles) from Kinshasa, is among troops from France, Zaire's former colonial power Belgium, Britain and Portugal waiting to evacuate expatriates if trouble erupts.</p>
