<p>The largest cruise ship in the world, taller than the Statue of Liberty, was delivered Saturday by shipbuilder Fincantieri to Miami, Fla.-based Carnival Corp,  the Italian group said over the weekend.</p>
<p>The company said it had handed the 100,000 plus gross ton ship over to Carnival, the world's largest cruise line, in a ceremony at its Monfalcone shipyard in northeastern Italy.</p>
<p>"The "Carnival Destiny' is the world's largest passenger ship of all time," said a statement from Fincantieri, part of state industrial holding IRI.</p>
<p>No price was given for the 885 foot vessel, which was completed in 20 months and is big enough for 3,400 passengers and 1,000 crew with 16 decks and 1,320 cabins, most of which had ocean views.</p>
<p>The cruise liner also featured a nine-deck high atrium, a theatre seating 1,600 people, two restaurants of 1,050 and 750 seats and four swimming pools.</p>
<p>The largest cruise ship had previously been the 77,000-ton "Sun Princess' owned by P&amp;O's Princess Cruises U.S. unit, which Fincantieri built last November.</p>
<p>Fincantieri-built ships were the first passenger ships after World War II to take emigrants to Australia and the late Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis once worked as a stevedore at its docks in Trieste.</p>
