<p>U.S. rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's Corp said on Tuesday that more regional Japanese banks are likely to fail over the next couple of years, but the failures will not have a major negative impact on Japan's financial system.  </p>
<p>Naoko Nemoto, an associate director at S&amp;P, told reporters that the rating agency had expected Hanwa Bank Ltd to fail.</p>
<p>Japanese authorities last month ordered the regional bank to halt its business -- the first time they have ordered a bank to shut in five decades.</p>
<p>Hanwa is based in western Japan.</p>
<p>She added: "It will be difficult for second-tier Japanese banks with weak credibility to continue their operations."  </p>
<p>"The possibility is high that several (second-tier) regional banks will go under in the future," Nemoto said.</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities' decision to wind down Hanwa Bank by establishing a new bank to take over its assets and collect loans over a certain time period could become the method by which they deal with future bank failures in Japan, he said.</p>
<p>Hanwa Bank is only the third bank failure in Japan in the postwar era.</p>
<p>Like much of Japan's financial system, Hanwa was hard-hit by the collapse of property prices from the sky-high levels of the 1980s "bubble" era, when share prices also soared.  </p>
<p>Ernest Napier, a director at S&amp;P, told reporters in the same news conference that financial failures would occur in the process of financial liberalisation as Japanese regulators were shifting their grip to "self-responsibility" from protection.</p>
<p>"We will see some regional bank failures," he said. But he said this would be a "natural process".</p>
<p>As long as the process was well-managed, regional bank failures would not cause a lack of confidence in the financial system, he said.</p>
<p>Napier also said the Finance Ministry had made it clear that major Japanese financial institutions would not collapse and that the authorities would not hesitate to step in if they faced difficulty.</p>
