<headline>ALPINE SKIING-GIANT SLALOM WASHED OUT, OTHER RACES IN JEOPARDY.</headline>
<dateline>PARK CITY, Utah 1996-11-22</dateline>

<p>Steady rain throughout the night forced the postponement of a men's World Cup giant slalom Friday, and organisers rescheduled the race for Monday at the end of the four-race Park City programme.</p>
<p>Continued rain on Friday and the forecast of wet, heavy snow falling in the evening, however, could threaten the entire programme.</p>
<p>The unseasonable rain began about 9 p.m. Thursday and continued to pepper a race course already softened by warm temperatures and sunshine.</p>
<p>A women's giant slalom was conducted under good conditions on Thursday, won by Sabina Panzanini of Italy.</p>
<p>The revised schedule includes a women's slalom Saturday and a men's slalom Sunday, provided the weather and conditions cooperate.</p>
<p>Race officials were working feverishly Friday to compact the snow and treat it with chemicals to restore the firm surface essential to racing.</p>
<p>If the race course surface cannot be packed down sufficiently, the new wet snow that is expected could transform the course into a quagmire, threatening cancellation of the whole programme.</p>
