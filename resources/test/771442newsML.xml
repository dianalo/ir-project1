<headline>Helsinki up with Nokia at new highs, Raisio drags.</headline>

<p>Shares headed further into record high territory in early Thursday trade on bullish U.S. markets and with Nokia at all-time highs above its Wall Street close, but brokers said dealings were subdued.</p>
<p>Holidays and data due later -- U.S. Q2 advance real GDP at 1530/1230 GMT -- kept investors sidelined, brokers said.</p>
<p>Raisio fell sharply on news U.S. Monsanto had a licensing agreement to develop a cholesterol-lowering oil, but later traded off lows, down 21.00 markka at 586.00.</p>
<p>The company said it was looking into the implications of the plan, which could rival its Benecol cholesterol-cutting agent.  </p>
<p>Merita opened up at 23.20 markka, paring Wednesday's losses. "On Wednesday we saw a surprising situation in that one sector was so low against otherwise bullish market, but it was simply profit-taking in Merita," one broker said.</p>
<p>Metra continued to rally, up 6.00 markka at 195.00, as brokers said the stock was driven by dollar strength and a joint-venture in Japan it announced on Wednesday. "I believe it can hit 200 markka in a week," another broker said. -- Helsinki Newsroom +358-9-680 50 248</p>
