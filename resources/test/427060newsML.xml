<p>Opposition Social Democrats (SPD) on Friday postponed key German tax reform talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats in protest against government plans to slash aid to coal miners.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel's tax reform plan, which includes 30 billion marks ($17.5 billion) in tax cuts, is seen by both sides as a way to spark investment, create jobs and get the economy back on track.</p>
<p>Weakness of the economy has caused concern about Germany's ability to meet targets to qualify for European economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>But opposition leaders said they could not talk with the coalition about creating new jobs while the government was making plans to throw thousands of coal miners out of work.</p>
<p>No new date was set for the tax talks but SPD leaders were to discuss the matter on Monday, a party official said.</p>
<p>Waigel said the government was still ready to talk with the SPD about tax reforms despite the decision to postpone the talks.</p>
<p>"We are open for further talks but there must be a real will on the part of the SPD to reach an agreement," he said in a statement.</p>
<p>The SPD postponed the talks after Heinz Schleusser, SPD finance minister of the coal-mining state of North Rhine-Westphalia, said he would boycott Saturday's round.</p>
<p>Schleusser said he was protesting against Bonn's plan to cut aid to the coal industry to 3.8 billion marks in the year 2005 from around 10 billion annually now.</p>
<p>The SPD said in a statement, "The government's plan to eliminate 60,000 jobs in German mines is an unacceptable provocation... In this atmosphere and on this basis the planned tax talks have no point."</p>
<p>CDU general secretary Peter Hintze said Schleusser's decision "could strengthen the suspicion the SPD is not prepared to join the battle to reduce unemployment but is playing party tactical games."</p>
<p>The proposed cuts in coal subsidies would hit hardest in North Rhine-Westphalia and Saarland, which both have SPD governments. State officials termed the plan a catastrophe.</p>
<p>North Rhine Westphalia state premier Johannes Rau said the government plans would lead to the closing of 10 coal mines by 2005. Additional unemployment benefits for out-of-work miners would surpass any savings in subsidies, he said.</p>
<p>Rau said the state did not have the funds to increase its share of the subsidies as the federal government demands.</p>
<p>"I cannot imagine Chancellor Kohl understands how dramatic the situation is," Rau said.</p>
<p>Miners demonstrated across the country on Friday, blocking highways, occupying mines and parading in downtown areas.</p>
<p>The Berliner Zeitung reported earlier that following two unsuccessful rounds of tax talks last week, the government was ready to give ground on Saturday on proposals to tax unemployment benefits and pensions, if it could raise gasoline and value-added taxes by about 25 to 30 billion marks instead.</p>
<p>Government officials, commenting on the newspaper report, said no firm decisions had been made. In the past, SPD officials said they opposed a rise in VAT to finance tax reform.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was already polarised on Thursday before the coal news as data showed unemployment reached another postwar record in February. SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine said this was a black mark for Kohl's government.</p>
<p>Waigel has said tax reform will proceed with or without the SPD. But the opposition could use its majority in the upper house of parliament to give any legislation a rough ride.</p>
<p>The Berliner Zeitung also reported the government was ready to accept a top tax rate a little above 40 percent, bowing to SPD opposition to a deeper cut. The top rate is now 53 percent.</p>
<p>The top tax rate, and government proposals to tax income from night- and holiday-shifts, were among the major stumbling blocks in earlier talks.</p>
