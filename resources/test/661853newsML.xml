<p>The families of Timothy McVeigh's bomb victims applauded the death sentence handed down against him on Friday and said they hoped the anti-government paranoia that inspired the attack would die with him.</p>
<p>Dozens of people gathered at the downtown Oklahoma City site where the blast on April 19, 1995, killed 168 people, and many applauded briefly as news came through that McVeigh had been sentenced to death inside a courtroom 600 miles (1,000 km) away in Denver.</p>
<p>There was, however, little of the joy seen here last week when the Denver jury first found McVeigh guilty of the worst terrorist attack ever on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>Instead of cheers and hugs, small groups of people simply held each other's hands and wiped away a few tears.</p>
<p>"You don't want to celebrate somebody else's death," said Catherine Alaniz, whose father Claude Medearis was killed in the blast. "But my dad didn't have a choice to live or die and I dont think McVeigh should either. We got the verdict that we deserved."</p>
<p>While some survivors and family members wanted McVeigh sentenced to life in prison without parole, the vast majority had called for the death penalty and hope the appeals process does not postpone McVeigh's execution beyond a few years.</p>
<p>"The punishment fits the crime. I mean, he killed 168 people. What other sentence could there be?" said Jim Denny, whose young son suffered brain damage in the bombing and whose daughter was also injured.</p>
<p>Behind him, a small group of victims sang "God Bless America" as they unfurled an American flag and draped it over the chain-link fence that surrounds the grassy field where the Alfred P. Murrah federal building stood before it was torn apart by McVeigh's truck bomb.</p>
<p>McVeigh was a decorated Gulf War veteran whose anti-government ideas turned to violence after 82 Branch Davidian cult members were killed in a siege by federal agents at Waco, Texas, in 1993.</p>
<p>He bombed the Murrah building on the second anniversary of the fiery end to the Waco siege, allegedly hoping the terrorist attack would spark an uprising against the federal government.</p>
<p>In asking for the death sentence, prosecutors attacked the so-called Patriot Movement that McVeigh has been linked to and instead labeled him a traitor.</p>
<p>The families of those killed said they hoped the death sentence would send a message to right-wing extremists like McVeigh that Americans would not tolerate their message of hate.</p>
<p>"If we were to let him off with a light sentence, who knows how many other people would want to step up to the plate and do the same thing?" said Kathleen Treanor, whose four-year-old daughter Ashley Eckles was killed. "We have to make sure this doesn't happen again and if we had backed away from the death penalty issue, it would encourage other radicals out there."</p>
<p>But there were some voices of dissent.</p>
<p>Bud Welch, whose daughter Julie died in the bombing, has been a staunch critic of the death penalty and predicted on Friday that many people's desire for revenge might backfire when McVeigh is actually put to death.</p>
<p>"How can you receive peace from yet another death? I think people will have even more trouble dealing with it all after he is killed," Welch said.</p>
<p>Others said they felt no joy at the sentence but insisted there was no other option.</p>
<p>"This by no means brings my husband back. It by no means heals my heart but it does mean he can't do it to anybody else," said Janet Walker, one of about 100 people who saw the sentence verdict on a special telecast of the Denver court's proceedings in an auditorium on the outskirts of Oklahoma City.</p>
<p>Calvin Mosier, who was injured in the bombing and lost a close friend, said any other sentence would have allowed McVeigh to promote his cause from inside prison.</p>
<p>"He'll not be able to espouse his theories and ideas on a network or computer. His story is ended," Mosier said.</p>
