<p>A Hillsborough County proposal for a half-cent sales tax increase that would benefit the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is legally worded and will remain on the Sept. 3 ballot, Judge James Whittemore ruled late Monday evening.</p>
<p>In a 15-page order, issued after 10 p.m. EDT, Whittemore upheld the language of the ballot question and rejected the argument by former Tampa Mayor William Poe that the ballot issue was unconstitutional.</p>
<p>Poe did not immediately say if he would appeal. In his lawsuit, Poe claimed that the proposed Tampa Bay Bucs stadium tax was buried in a "wish list" of police, fire and infrastructure funding, and would unfairly benefit a private, for-profit football team.</p>
<p>If approved, the sales tax increase would raise $2.7 billion over the next three decades, with 12 percent of that revenue used to pay debt service on a $168 million stadium for the football team.</p>
<p>In his order, Judge Whittemore wrote, "The legislative determination that the community stadium satisfies a paramount public purpose is not so clearly wrong as to be beyond the authority" of local government. The judge also ruled that the ballot language summary was lawful and would not mislead voters.</p>
<p>The Hillsborough County commission has said it would not go forward with the ballot issue if the Bucs do not sign a lease for the current stadium by Thursday.</p>
<p>Under an agreement between the city of Tampa and Hillsborough County, the Bucs' stadium would be financed with revenue bonds issued by the Tampa Sports Authority and repaid from stadium and sales tax revenues.</p>
