<p>MidAmerican Energy Co said it is not conceding in its effort to merge with IES Industries Inc, despite IES' announcement Thursday that its shareholders approved its proposed three-way merger with WPL Holdings Inc and Interstate Power Co.</p>
<p>"We're not conceding that (the three-way merger) as the outcome," said MidAmerican chief executive Stanley Bright in a press conference Thursday monitored by teleconference.  </p>
<p>IES said shareholders representing 57 percent of total shares outstanding voted Thursday at a meeting to approve the three-way merger.</p>
<p>In response, Bright said, "The information we have ... would suggest to me that the vote is likely to be much, much closer than that. The outcome cannot be known until a final tally is completed and we will await that."</p>
<p>Shares in Des Moines-based MidAmerican, the largest power utility in Iowa, were up 3/8 to 16-1/4. Shares in Cedar Rapids, Iowa-based IES, which calls MidAmerican's merger proposal a hostile takeover attempt, were off 1 at 32-1/8.  </p>
<p>The final tally rendered in a few weeks may prove to be closer than the preliminary results, but it will not likely change the outcome, said Securities Corp of Iowa utilities analyst John Curti. "I don't know what MidAmerican can do ... It looks like the shareholders have spoken," Curti said.</p>
<p>MidAmerican proposed a $1.17-billion merger with IES a month ago and has since vigorously opposed the three-way merger of IES, WPL and Interstate, in which analysts estimated about $2.25 billion in equity would change hands.</p>
<p>The three-way merger would result in a new holding company to be called Interstate Energy Corp.  </p>
<p>IES said in mid-August that its board voted to reject the MidAmerican offer.</p>
<p>IES said Thursday that the shareholders of Madison, Wis.-based WPL and Dubuque, Iowa-based Interstate also voted to approve the three-way merger.</p>
<p>"If in fact the shareholders have approved the three-way merger, we will have to consider our options ... We think there are major issues that remain to be resolved in accomplishing the three-way merger," Bright said.</p>
