<p>Jordan, last year's Middle East economic summit host, has decided to limit its delegation this year to ministerial level, ruling out a higher profile political team due to lack of peace progress, officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>They said the cabinet approved on Saturday the composition of a 46-strong official delegation, including 15 captains of industry and commerce from the private sector and semi-governmental associations.</p>
<p>The delegation will be led by Trade and Industry Minister Ali Abu Al-Ragheb, they said.</p>
<p>Officials say the government had considered a more senior delegation headed by Prime Minister Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti but opted for ministerial representation more appropriate with its expectations of the summit.</p>
<p>Many businessmen warn Israel could find itself isolated by Arab businessmen at the November 12-14 conference which will group 85 states and some 25 international groups, unless it makes progress in talks with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>Officials say a faltering peace process and heightened tension in the region have placed unexpected hurdles in front of the coming Cairo summit, the third in a series of annual meetings originally aimed at integrating Israel.</p>
<p>Jordan's government, which predicted a flurry of multi-million dollar contracts at last year's summit in Amman, is wary of raising hopes unrealistically this time round.</p>
<p>So far 30 Jordanian businessmen have enrolled, in addition to the official delegation.</p>
<p>Last year Jordan's private sector submitted a prepared package of 137 projects worth $1.2 billion to the Amman summit. This year, organisers say, the private sector has not produced a summit wish-list.</p>
<p>The Jordanian government will submit $4 billion worth of projects, many still awaiting investors since they were first promoted at the Amman summit a year ago.  -- Amman Bureau +9626-623776</p>
