<p>Medical Polymers Technologies Inc said Friday that it has been unable to pay all interest due as of April 1 on a $797,000 note secured from 24 stockholders in 1995, and because of the default, the company is considering a complete reorganization of its affairs.</p>
<p>The company said it plans to seek shareholder approval on a one-for-seven reverse stock split of its common stock and a conversion of the $797,000 note, including interest, to common stock.  </p>
<p>"Cash flow from our existing products, although improving, is not sufficient to allow for an orderly retirement of debt and continuing operations," stated company Chief Executive Lee Cooke.  After considering various alternatives, the company board decided that this reorganization plan is the best, Cooke continued.</p>
<p>Besides a reverse split, the company said it will seek cancellation of 3.2 million shares of escrowed performance stock.  </p>
<p>The company said it would have about 1.2 million common shares issued after a one-for-seven reverse split and cancelling the escrow shares. It said it would have to issue about 1.2 million common shares after the reverse split to settle the note.</p>
<p>For the fiscal year ending June 30 the company reported a net loss of $917,000, or $0.11 per share, on revenues of $504,000.  For the prior fiscal year the company reported a net loss of $2.5 million, or $0.29 per share, on revenues of $305,000.</p>
<p>The company said it would also seek a name change to U.S. Medical Systems Inc.</p>
