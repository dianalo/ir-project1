<p>China has trained a crack division of rapid-response paratroops to fight and survive in all terrains and to operate behind enemy lines, the China news service said on Friday.</p>
<p>The airborne division was able to reach any combat zone in China within 10 hours, it said quoting the headquarters of the air force of the People's Liberation Army, which was shocked into a race to modernise its military since it saw the sophisticated weaponry used in the Gulf War.</p>
<p>The paratroopers had attained battlefield standards similar to those in developed nations in terms of parachuting, combat and survival skills, the report said.</p>
<p>The elite troops had been trained in explosives, engineering, reconnaissance, communications and chemical warfare as well as in basic military skills, it said. The airborne division, originally divided into different specialist units, launched a training programme in the mid-1980s to develop more multi-skilled troops, it said.</p>
<p>Fighting methods and zones of combat varied greatly in modern warfare and soldiers had to be able to survive and fight in all environments, it said.</p>
<p>In the last 10 years, paratroops had trained in different terrains and climates including deserts, mountains, forests and paddy fields to help them to adapt to varying conditions, it said.</p>
<p>China has caused unease among many of its Asian neighbours in recent years with its drive to modernise a military burdened with obsolete weapons, inadequate training and poor maintenance by going on an overseas shopping spree for more advanced weapons.</p>
<p>China's three million-strong People's Liberation Army is the largest in the world.</p>
