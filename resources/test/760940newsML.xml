<p>Cisco Systems Inc on Monday said it has signed a definitive agreement to buy the high-speed networking business of privately held Integrated Network Corp for $108 million in cash.</p>
<p>As part of the purchase of Integrated's Dagaz xDSL unit, Cisco also agreed to assume the business' option plan with about 230,000 shares of Cisco stock, which the company said are worth about $16.5 million.</p>
<p>Cisco will acquire Dagaz xDSL's products and intellectual property, personnel and other xDSL-related assets.  </p>
<p>In connection with the transaction, Cisco said it expects to take a charge of between $0.08 and $0.11 per share against after-tax earnings in the first fiscal quarter of 1998.</p>
<p>Cisco expects the transaction to have a neutral impact on its earnings in the first year and to be accretive thereafter.</p>
<p>xDSL products and systems use high-speed Digital Subscriber Line to allow service providers and enterprises to more efficiently and quickly deploy high-speed data, video and voice service to end users over the existing infrastructure of ordinary copper telephone lines.</p>
<p>The purchase has received board approvals from each company and is expected to be completed in August, Cisco said.</p>
