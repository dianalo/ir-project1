<p>Kapiti-Horowhenua power company Electra on Thursday reported a NZ$7.12 million operating profit before tax and distributions to customers in the year to March 31, 1997, up from $3.8 million last year.</p>
<p>After tax and distributions the profit was $230,000 against $689,000 last year.</p>
<p>Electra's shares are held by the Horowhenua Energy Trust and the company's operating surplus is distributed to customers in the form of discounts as a matter of policy.  </p>
<p>Electra Chairman Warren Thessman said revenue in the period was up six percent to $41.6 million, while operating costs per customer declined nearly 3 percent.</p>
<p>The operating surplus as a percentage of total shareholders' equity increased from 7.3 percent in 1996 to 13.6 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>Electra had previously announced a 16.5 percent discount to customers this year. This was equal to a minimum of $150 for customers with the company for the whole year, up from $105 last year.  </p>
<p>"The pleasing aspect of our performance in the last year is the company has been able to continue to increase its efficiency through improving its business processes as well as significantly improving its customer satisfaction levels.</p>
<p>"The company has also benefited from a decrease in transmission charges from the national grid operator, Transpower," Thessman said.</p>
