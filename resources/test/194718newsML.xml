<p>Australia's Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said on Saturday that outspoken race row MP Pauline Hanson was pushing a "dumb and divisive" political agenda.</p>
<p>Speaking in Melbourne before the launch of a photographic exhibition on multiculturalism by Marina Mahathir, daughter of Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, Fischer also defended his government's refusal to criticise Malaysia for the suppression of a conference on East Timor last weekend.</p>
<p>Hanson sparked a passionate national debate on race and immigration with a maiden parliamentary speech two months ago warning Australia was being swamped by Asians.</p>
<p>The Queensland MP also criticised government assistance for Aborigines and has aimed her barbs at other minority groups too.</p>
<p>"As the member for Oxley (Hanson) works her way through her predictable list, mainly Asians, Aborigines, gays and most recently Indonesian and Singaporean soldiers, it can be fully expected next week it will be the Maories and Kiwis and maybe even an invasion from Chile," Fischer said.</p>
<p>Australia had a large intake of Chilean migrants in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Fischer said he understood Hanson would appear on a television gardening programme next week.</p>
<p>"Her agenda remains dumb and divisive and is now taking the next media turn to be expected, namely the garden show circuit."</p>
<p>Australian Prime Minister John Howard has been widely criticised for not directly condemning Hanson for her remarks.</p>
<p>But Fischer, who heads the junior party in the ruling conservative coalition and is also trade minister, has been less reluctant to attack Hanson.</p>
<p>Fischer defended the federal government's decision not to lecture Malaysia over a short-lived conference last week on human rights in the territory of East Timor. Malaysian police arrested 46 international participants at the conference, including 10 Australians.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day there will be areas where Australians and the Australian government will disagree with aspects of human rights ... in Asia," Fischer said.</p>
<p>"But that should be kept in perspective as many in Asia disagree with certain internal policies of Australia."</p>
