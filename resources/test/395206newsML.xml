<p>The German government said on Friday it was still engaged in dialogue with Tehran over the fate of an Iranian journalist arrested in his homeland this month but had agreed to keep the talks confidential.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry spokesman Martin Erdmann said Bonn had been in contact with the Iranian government several times recently concerning Faraj Sarkuhi, who was arrested in Iran earlier this month and charged with trying to leave the country illegally.</p>
<p>"We're declining to discuss the situation publicly because it serves the interests of the person better concerned if we use the path of quiet diplomacy," Erdmann said.</p>
<p>Friday's edition of the Tageszeitung daily reported Sarkuhi had telephoned his wife, who lives in Germany together with his two children, to say he was well.</p>
<p>Farideh Zebarjad, quoted her husband as saying from prison: "I am well, I can even listen to the radio and watch television." He also said he expected to be convicted, but did not say what for.</p>
<p>The telephone call was the first confirmation that Sarkuhi, editor of the monthly Adineh (Friday), was still alive since his arrest.</p>
<p>Zebarjad said earlier this week Sarkuhi's brother Ismail, also under arrest, had contacted her to say that if she cooperated with Tehran, her husband could be released in two or three months.</p>
<p>He urged her to dismiss as a forgery a letter from her husband in which he alleged he was held for six weeks and tortured by the Iranian secret service in Tehran late last year to force him to confess to spying for Germany.</p>
<p>Zebarjad has said she fears her husband is being held as a bargaining chip to put pressure on German authorities not to convict an Iranian and four Lebanese on trial in Berlin for a 1992 assassination of Kurdish dissidents.</p>
<p>State prosecutors have angered Tehran by accusing the Iranian government of ordering the killings. The trial is expected to end within the next few months. Iran denies any involvement in the killings.</p>
