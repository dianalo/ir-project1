<p>Even if you've never bought a technology stock or fund, you may have profited from huge gains in technology stocks during the past six years.</p>
<p>The reason is that many diversified funds have loaded up on technology shares, investing 30 percent to 40 percent or even more of their assets in the sector.</p>
<p>Some observers think it's past time to back away from such bets. The surge in technology stocks that began in mid-1990 carried them more than 300 percent higher during the past six years, better than double the already-handsome gain for the S&amp;P 500 index of stock prices.</p>
<p>Not that there haven't been interruptions.</p>
<p>The most recent one came last summer, when inventory buildups at some firms led to a sharp sell-off in technology stocks. But the shares invariably have rebounded sharply from such setbacks. In fact, the S&amp;P 500 Technology Index gained 22 percent through September vs. an 11.6 percent gain for the broader S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>"There's been a significant comeback in technology," acknowledges John Coil, an investment officer who specialises in technology investments at Standard &amp; Poor's. "It's been fuelled mainly by an increase in demand for personal computers, with lower prices and new operating systems from Microsoft and Intel."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, no fewer than 57 diversified equity funds tracked by Morningstar Mutual Funds have at least 30 percent of their assets in technology shares. If the bull market in technology stocks persists, those funds and their shareholders will be well-rewarded. However, they should understand the risks they are taking.</p>
<p>For starters, it's important to realise that technology stocks won't necessarily outperform the broader market forever -- despite what some analysts claim.</p>
<p>In fact, a study by the No-Load Fund Analyst investment newsletter in Orinda, Calif., found that during the 26 years through mid-1996, technology shares gained 682 percent -- far less than the S&amp;P 500's 2,094 percent gain. The study included several sustained periods when technology stocks were poor performers, including the devastating technology decline from 1983 through mid-1991.</p>
<p>Moreover, you have to be in the right sectors of the technology industry at the right times if you want to earn stunning returns over the long run.</p>
<p>For example, communications stocks delivered 1,028 percent gains during the period from January, 1988 through May of 1996. But software stocks posted a 594 percent return -- and hardware stocks (shares of computer and other equipment manufacturers) gained only 50 percent, according to the No-Load Fund Analyst.</p>
<p>The moral? Technology stocks will continue to offer solid returns to long-term investors who are willing to ride out severe price fluctuations and occasional prolonged slumps in the sector.</p>
<p>But most investors should consider doing their technology investing through a mutual fund, so that a professional money manager can decide which sectors offer the best values from year to year, or month to month.</p>
<p>Some investors might choose to stash 10 percent or so of their total savings in a technology fund such as T. Rowe Price Science &amp; Technology (800-638-5660; $2,500 minimum investment; no-load), which has a nine-year record and holds a diversified portfolio of technology shares in industries ranging from software to semiconductors.</p>
<p>Others might prefer to invest in a more diversified fund that holds a significant technology stake.</p>
<p>Some recent candidates included Harbour Capital Appreciation (800-422-1050; $2,000 minimum; no-load), which recently held more than 30 percent of its portfolio in technology stocks. Manager Spiros Segalas believes that the sector offers the best potential for long-term growth.</p>
<p>Another choice: Wasatch Mid-Cap (800-551-1700; $2,000 minimum; no-load). Manager Karey Barker looks for companies that have earnings-growth rates of at least 25 percent over the recent one-year period. That approach caused her recently to invest almost half of the fund's portfolio in medium-sized technology firms, and has led the fund to a 20 percent average annualized return during the past three years.</p>
<p>Ed Keely, manager of Founders Growth (800-525-2440; $1,000 minimum investment; 0.25 percent load), recently held 40 percent of his fund's portfolio in large tech firms such as Cisco Systems and Ascend Communications. Keely often buys stocks that have suffered temporary losses due to earnings disappointments, and holds them as they recover. That strategy kept the fund's losses to a minimum during the recent technology stock correction.</p>
