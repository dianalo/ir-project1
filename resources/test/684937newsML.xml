<p>French shares bounced into positive territory, after opening down half a percent, when the Japanese finance ministry said Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had been wrongly reported in remarks that triggered a steep sell-off on Wall Street overnight.  </p>
<p>The CAC-40 blue-chip share index was 6.52 points or 0.24 percent higher at 2,768.72 points, at 0812 GMT, after opening down 0.49 percent in the wake of Wall Street's second biggest one-day loss.</p>
<p>New York's late afternoon sell-off was ignited by Hashimoto's comments that stable exchange rates were critical to Japan's continued buying of U.S. government securities.</p>
<p>"I hope the U.S. will engage in efforts and in cooperation to maintain exchange stability so we will not succumb to the temptation to sell off Treasury bills and switch our funds to gold," Hashimoto said.  </p>
<p>But Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told reporters in Japan on Tuesday that Japan had not sold U.S. Treasuries and had no intention of doing so.</p>
<p>He also said Hashimoto's "real intention" concerning investments in U.S. Treasuries had been incorrectly reported.</p>
<p>The remarks, coming a few minutes after the French opening, wiped out opening index losses which had already been softened by earlier Japanese remarks designed to reassure the markets.</p>
<p>State-controlled French bank Credit Lyonnais was among the biggest early gainers with a 4.50 percent jump after a newspaper report that it expects a two billion franc profit for 1997 after a cost-cutting programme.</p>
