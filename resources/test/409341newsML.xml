<p>Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer said on Thursday that current foreign exchange rate levels were more in line with fundamentals on both sides of the Atlantic.</p>
<p>In a speech to a Goldman Sachs conference in Frankfurt, Tietmeyer said the recent exchange rate corrections should not be seen signalling the future single currency would be weak.</p>
<p>"As the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 countries recently affirmed in Berlin, what we have seen so far is a correction of the exaggerated moves seen in past years," he said.  </p>
<p>Tietmeyer says currencies better suit fundamentals</p>
<p>A text of the speech was released in advance of delivery.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer said that Germany remained interested in a stable mark and a stable euro and that he hoped this view was shared by other European Union nations.</p>
<p>"We in Germany are interested in the mark remaining a stable currency and in the euro being a comparably stable and strong currency," he said. "I hope that this is also seen this way in other European countries."</p>
<p>He added that the stability and credibility of the single currency would play an important role in ensuring a smooth transfer from national currencies to the euro.</p>
<p>"Only then will the transition from national currencies to the euro be possible without (market) distortions," he said.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer said that the decision on which countries could take part in the euro should be made in the early part of 1998, no earlier and no later.</p>
<p>He added that any "short-sighted decisions" on fiscal policy, or any softening of the Maastricht entry criteria would set a wrong signal.</p>
