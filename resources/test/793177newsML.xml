<p>German City Estates NV said on Tuesday it was changing its name to European City Estates NV, in line with its wider area of European operations.</p>
<p>It also said the operational result after tax for the half year ended June 30 was 4.1 million guilders, an increase of 35 percent over the same period in 1996. It said the investment results in this period of over one million guilders should be added, giving a total profit of 5.14 million versus 2.66 million at 30 June 1996.</p>
<p>The operational result after tax for 1997 is expected to be around 20 percent higher than the 6.3 million guilders in 1996.</p>
<p>The total investment return for the whole year 1997 will partly depend on prevailling market conditions at the year end, it said.</p>
<p>"Market conditions in Germany were generally depressed during the first half of the year with further reductions in rents and a general trend of widening yields for all but the most prime property," it said.</p>
<p>It added that the Dutch market, in which European City Estates has begun to invest, has shown consistent signs of improvement indicating a revival of capital values.</p>
<p>"With the northern European property markets, apart from Germany, showing signs of improvement, the company will continue to target those markets and specific locations offering better returns and potential for growth in value," it said.</p>
