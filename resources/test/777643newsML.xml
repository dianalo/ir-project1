<p>Philippine inflation in July should rise to 5.3 percent from 4.8 percent in the previous month as a result of rising food prices, a Reuters poll of six financial institutions showed on Monday.</p>
<p>The July forecast is lower than the 8.9 percent posted in the same month last year.</p>
<p>Analysts said their forecasts for July inflation did not fully factor in the de facto devaluation of the peso on July 11, since its effect would be felt only in subsequent months.</p>
<p>"The rainy season is the factor in July. There's a harder time transporting goods to Metro Manila. We expect prices of basic commodities to go up," said Antonio Panaligan, an analyst of F. Yap Securities.</p>
<p>But Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI) economist Ces Tanchoco, whose forecast of six percent was the highest among those polled, said the peso's fall would have an immediate impact on inflation.</p>
<p>"It's the confusion arising from the exchange rate," she said, adding that traders may have taken advantage of the situation and raised prices of goods.</p>
<p>The de facto devaluation of the peso has led economists to raise their inflation forecast for the year. The Reuters poll showed an average projection of 6.04 percent from an earlier estimate of 5.8 percent.</p>
<p>Inflation in 1996 was 8.4 percent. It averaged 4.6 percent in the first six months of this year.</p>
<p>Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo said on Monday inflation would remain within the six to seven percent range for the year despite the oil price increase announced late last week.</p>
<p>"If it's going to have an effect on inflation, it will be minimal so that we can still attain an average of six to seven percent this year," de Ocampo told reporters.</p>
<p>Oil companies raised their prices effective August 1 following the sharp depreciation of the peso against the dollar. Most of the country's petroleum products are imported.</p>
<p>The oil firms have said the move will not be inflationary since the new prices are still lower than the levels before the industry was deregulated in February.</p>
<p>Though the peso was expected to trade at 28/29 to the dollar for the rest of the year, economists said that would bring the peso average for the year to about 27.67, a 5.6 percent depreciation from last year's 26.216.</p>
<p>Analysts, however, said the crucial factor would be the government's effectiveness in stamping out the inflationary fears of consumers and cracking down on  profiteers.</p>
