<p>When Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Inc. recently launched Caverject, an anti-impotence drug, it ordered up the usual physician marketing programme. Then, in line with a growing trend, it also called Time magazine.</p>
<p>And Newsweek and Smithsonian and the New Yorker magazines and more than 50 other national publications and radio stations -- all of which are part of a massive "consumer awareness" campaign about impotence, paid for by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn.</p>
<p>Whether it is impotence, baldness, depression, schizophrenia, osteoporosis or allergies, consumers are being flooded with ads for health problems -- and often, in a departure from tradition, prescription drugs to cure them.</p>
<p>Spending for prescription drug ads in all U.S. media topped $323 million in just the first six months of 1996, compared with $356.8 million for all of 1995, according to Competitive Media Reporting, a market research firm.</p>
<p>"It certainly is a growing category for Time magazine and for news magazines in general," said Robert Pondiscio, spokesman for the Time Warner Inc. newsweekly.</p>
<p>Time broke new ground in the category last month with a 90-page special issue called "Frontiers of Medicine" almost fully underwritten by Britain's Glaxo Wellcome Plc, the largest drug manufacturer in the world.</p>
<p>The spread of direct-to-consumer prescription drug advertising marks a victory for drug companies, which fought for years with physicians and regulators opposed to the idea.</p>
<p>The American Medical Association, based in Chicago, still publicly opposes such ads. The Food and Drug Administration, after banning the ads in the early 1980s, now allows them as long as they follow certain guidelines.</p>
<p>FDA rules explain why prescription drug ads sometimes identify a company and a drug, and other times do not.</p>
<p>For instance, Pfizer Inc. is advertising its Zyrtec allergy drug in major daily newspapers.</p>
<p>The ads show a picture of a smiling woman surrounded by wildflowers and weeds. Underneath is large-type text promoting the drug and off to one side is a 1,500-word "brief summary" in fine print about side effects and dosages. The summary is required by the FDA because the ad mentions Pfizer and the drug by name.</p>
<p>In contrast, one of Glaxo's many ads in the Time special issue describes how Olympic gold medalist Jackie Joyner-Kersee keeps her asthma under control with a "program" put together by Glaxo. A toll-free telephone number is provided. Callers are automatically sent a free "asthma control kit" from Glaxo.</p>
<p>The ad makes no mention of the fact that Glaxo is a world leader in asthma medicines. Its Ventolin is an industry standard. Serevent was introduced a year ago and Flovent was just unveiled. Because none of these drugs is named in the ad, it does not have to include a brief summary of their attributes.</p>
<p>The FDA is talking with drug companies and broadcasters about how to handle radio and TV ads for prescription drugs. Some are airing, but so far remain much rarer than print ads.</p>
<p>These ads, whether they name the drug or not, are meant to raise consumers' awareness of new drugs and to reach physicians through patients.</p>
<p>"The ads are effective in informing consumers of the availability of a drug. The action step is to suggest to the consumer that they consult their physician," said Dick Johnson, spokesman for Hoechst Marion Roussel, which is advertising its Allegra allergy medicine this fall with pictures of a windsurfer skimming across an open field.</p>
<p>The ads seem to be working on the consumer end.</p>
<p>In 1987, about 18 percent of U.S. patients initiated conversations with their physicians about advertised drugs. In 1995, that figure was up to 51 percent, according to a study done by American Home Products Corp., which advertises Premarin for menopause and Effexor for depression.</p>
<p>"The ads create a more educated consumer and an educated consumer is more prepared to have an intelligent dialogue with the physician," said American Home spokeswoman Audrey Ashby.</p>
