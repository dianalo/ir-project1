<p>A Kazakh civil aviation official, rejecting charges by Indian aviation authorities, on Thursday blamed air traffic control at New Delhi airport for the world's worst mid-air collision.</p>
<p>"We think air traffic control at New Delhi airport is not satisfactorily organised, and minor mistakes...may lead to such large loss of life," Bekbulat Salimov, acting chairman of the Air Space Usage and Civil Aviation Committee, told Reuters.</p>
<p>All 349 people aboard were killed when a Saudi Arabia Airlines Boeing 747 and a Kazakh Ilyushin Il-76 cargo crashed above New Delhi last November.</p>
<p>The Airports Authority of India on Tuesday blamed Kazakh Airlines for the collision, saying the tragedy happened after the Kazakh aircraft failed to maintain the height assigned to it by air traffic controllers.</p>
<p>But Salimov said in a press release that "the most probable reasons for the crash" were the fact that New Delhi airport had only one take-off and landing runway and the absence of secondary radar control.</p>
<p>"This does not allow the Air Traffic Control operator to see on his radar screen a difference in altitudes of planes flying towards each other," the release said.</p>
<p>Salimov said the crew of the Boeing 747 were not informed that it was flying towards the Il-76, whose pilots were told only 38 seconds before the crash.</p>
<p>Kazakh Airlines had argued that their plane lost altitude suddenly in thick cloud after severe turbulence.</p>
<p>But the Directorate General of Civil Aviation, which oversees Indian air traffic and airports, rejected the Kazakh submission that air turbulence caused the collision.</p>
<p>The directorate said the sudden drop in altitude of the Kazakh aircraft was due to a technical fault in the plane's altitude transducer, a device converting non-electrical signals into electric ones.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia Airlines last month also blamed the Kazakh cargo plane for the accident.</p>
<p>But Salimov, speaking by telephone later, insisted the collision was caused by the poor quality of Air Traffic Control and said there had been seven "near-misses" above New Delhi Airport since last November.</p>
