<p>Hong Kong's financial markets watchdog, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), said on Wednesday it had signed agreements for regulatory cooperation with its counterparts in New Zealand and Spain.</p>
<p>The agreements would better protect investors and promote the integrity of financial markets in Hong Kong, New Zealand, and Spain by providing a framework for mutual assistance and the exchange of information, the SFC said in a statement.</p>
<p>A joint statement issued by the SFC and the Securities Commission of New Zealand said: "This Memorandum recognises the increasing international activity in the securities, futures and options markets and the corresponding need for mutual cooperation between the relevant national authorities".</p>
<p>The scope of the agreements would include the enforcement of laws, rules and regulations relating to securites and futures markets, clearing and settlement activities, takeovers and mergers, the disclosure of information relevant to investors, and the prevention of fraudulent practices.</p>
