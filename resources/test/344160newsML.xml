<p>The chairman of French holding company CGIP said Thursday he wants to sell a 20 percent stake in information technology company Cap Gemini and would consider several options for the proceeds of the potential sale, including a share buyback.</p>
<p>"We have known that we would not be a shareholder for the future. It is time for us to pass the baton," Ernest-Antoine Seilliere told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>CGIP has indicated a willingness to sell to Germany's Daimler-Benz AG, which holds 24.4 percent of Cap Gemini.  </p>
<p>Seilliere said CGIP has not held any discussions with the German company about the potential sale, but would be willing to entertain other offers if Daimler-Benz does not make a decision on its strategy.</p>
<p>CGIP has held the stake for 15 years.</p>
<p>"We cannot stay forever in this situation, but for the time being, it is wait-and-see. There is a limited time this can go on," he said, but declined to identify a timetable.</p>
<p>In November, CGIP sold four percent of its investment in Cap Gemini.  </p>
<p>Discussing the reasons that the holding company wants to sell the Cap Gemini stake, Seilliere noted CGIP's criteria to retain a strong role in its investments.</p>
<p>"We are not the powerful shareholder that can dedicate all its means to the company," he said.</p>
<p>CGIP would weigh several options for proceeds, including a share buyback, Seilliere said, adding the stock is trading at a discount despite a 51 percent jump since October.</p>
<p>The company would also consider expanding its 33 percent investment in private biological diagnostic firm BioMerieux Alliance.  </p>
<p>"It's a niche in the diagnostic world. It's a field where you can converge all sorts of information technology," he said.</p>
<p>Other considerations include building its current involvement in abrasive pellet firm  Wheelabrator-Allevard or quality control company  Bureau Veritas, he said.</p>
<p>Earnings for 1996, which are slated to be issued in early April, are expected to be strong, Seilliere said.</p>
<p>"They are going to be good because all the companies of the group are increasing their results," he said.</p>
<p>CGIP ended months of speculation in November when it signed a deal to acquire a 20 percent stake in French car parts maker Valeo SA from an investment company controlled by Italian businessman Carlo de Benedetti.</p>
