<p>The yield of the benchmark three percent 182nd 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) fell further to a record low of 2.100 percent on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>The yield ended at 2.120 percent on Friday in Tokyo.  </p>
<p>Traders said a rally in the bond's price was spearheaded by short-covering by traders and better-than-expected sales of newly launched corporate bonds to end-investors.</p>
<p>Some investment trust funds, however, bought cash put options, suggesting they take the view that the JGB market is approaching a ceiling, they said.</p>
<p>About 250 billion yen worth of corporate straight bonds were launched on Monday, which had been expected to depress the JGBs.</p>
