<headline>RESEARCH ALERT -- Red chip rules healthy long term.</headline>

<p>New guidelines imposed by China on red-chip companies listed in Hong Kong should support the healthy development of the sector in the long term, Nikko Research Center (HK) Ltd said in a report.</p>
<p>The impact on individual red chips would largely depend on their relationship with mainland authorities, it added.</p>
<p>China last week announced guidelines relating to asset injections, acquisitions and listings of red chips, which are Hong Kong-based companies with Chinese financial backing.</p>
<p>Nikko said the rule that asset acquisitions and injections had to be approved by relevant Chinese authorities was likely to hurt near-term sentiment the most.</p>
<p>But the regulations were widely anticipated and, in the long term, should support the healthy development of the red-chip sector, it said.</p>
<p>While the rules were likely to have minimal effect on large red chips well connected to central, ministerial or provincial authorities, question marks were raised over some companies.</p>
<p>Nikko said it wondered whether CITIC Pacific Ltd would receive immediate approval for China asset acquisitions given its weakened relationship to its parent following last year's management buyout.</p>
<p>Shum Yip Investment Ltd, Guangzhou Investment Co Ltd and GZI Transport Ltd, ultimately held by the Shenzhen or Guangzhou municipal authorities, may also weaken relative to better connected companies, it added.</p>
<p>Asset purchases were likely to be at reasonable prices rather than at the very favourable rates prevailing until now, and the introduction of quotas would slow acquisitions, which will hurt property developers especially, it said.</p>
<p>The prospect of favourable asset acquisitions was behind the recent surge by red chip shares on the Hong Kong stock market.</p>
