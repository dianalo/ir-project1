<p>A surge of refinery demand and the prospect of more Brent moving to the United States pushed North Sea crudes higher on Thursday, traders said.</p>
<p>Two Brent cargoes due to load May 9-11 were kept from the paper chains by a UK major then sold to a U.S. refiner at June Brent -35 cents, five to 10 cents firmer than Dated deals on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Almost everything is looking a little bit better today. There's a lot of oil moving out of the North Sea and it looks like more will follow," said a trader.</p>
<p>June Brent gained 7 cents to $18.13 a barrel by 1708 GMT.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs were also stronger, next week's dates talking at June Brent -36/-30 cents, 10 cents firmer than two deals early on Thursday and wiping out the prompt contango.</p>
<p>May 5-9 and May 12-16 were talked at June Brent -38/-30 cents and June Brent -36/-30 cents respectively, dealers said.</p>
<p>Other North Sea crudes were also stronger on the back of robust refining margins. Statfjord was the busiest of the grades, trading at least four times at premiums of between 13 and 15 cents to Dated Brent.</p>
<p>Ekofisk gained ground, a May 27-29 cargo fetching Dated Brent +20 cents, six cents firmer than a deal on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Dealers said heavy sales of May loading West African barrels to the Far East were leaving a gap in the U.S. Gulf which North Sea producers were more than happy to fill.</p>
<p>Mediterranean sours were also holding on to recent gains amid thin prompt supply of both Russian Urals and its main rival Iraqi Kirkuk Blend, traders said.</p>
<p>A large cargo of Urals due to load in early May was on offer at around Dated Brent -$1.00 against best bids no higher than -$1.10, they said.</p>
<p>Kirkuk traded earlier this week at Dated Brent -$1.30 cif Augusta or the equivalent of May OSP +25 cents fob Ceyhan.</p>
