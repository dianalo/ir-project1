<p>A Beirut military magistrate demanded on Wednesday up to 15 years hard labour for a journalist accused of contacting Israeli agents in Lebanon, judicial sources said.</p>
<p>Magistrate Riad Talee' also charged Pierre Atallah of the conservative newspaper an-Naharr with "distributing leaflets that incite strife, disturb Lebanon's relations with a friendly country and slander the army".</p>
<p>"When Atallah moved to an-Nahar in 1993...he interviewed Etian Saqr and published Saqr's ideas and his opposition to the Lebanese government, to the Syrian presence in Lebanon and to Hizbollah," the indictment handed down by Talee' said.</p>
<p>"The military magistrate demanded between three and 15 years in jail for Pierre Atallah," a judicial source told Reuters. No date has been set for the trial, he added.</p>
<p>Etian Saqr, former head of the Guardians of the Cedars, a small nationalist Christian militia during the 1975-90 civil war, was sentenced to life imprisonment in absentia last December for collaborating with Israel and undertaking hostile acts against Lebanon.</p>
<p>The indictment said investigations had shown that Atallah met Saqr regularly in 1990 while working for Middle East Television which broadcast inside Israel's south Lebanon occupation zone.</p>
<p>Two other Christians were also charged with Atallah with distributing leaflets.</p>
<p>Atallah, a Maronite, is the second Christian journalist to be indicted in two days. On Tuesday, Talee' demanded at least five years imprisonment for Tony Chamie, a television journalist editor, on charges of collaborating with Israel.</p>
<p>Atallah, a 34-year-old sub-editor at an-Nahar, was one of 48 people rounded up last December after a van carrying Syrian workers was machinegunned in a mainly Christian area north of Beirut.</p>
<p>He was released on bail in January.</p>
<p>The Paris-based press freedom watchdog group Reporters sans Frontieres (Reporters without Borders) has appealed to Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri for Atallah's release.</p>
