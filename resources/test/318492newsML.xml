<p>Street clashes in Albania at the weekend are the latest episode in a long saga of pyramid investment schemes which mushroomed across Eastern Europe in the post-communist era.</p>
<p>Albanians, the poorest among fellow East Europeans, were the latest to play Russian roulette with get-rich-quick schemes, which offered fast returns on their investments.</p>
<p>Popular anger turned to violence in the Albanian capital Tirana on Sunday when baton-wielding police dispersed some 3,000 protesters, as the sunken pyramid scheme scandal spilled into a political crisis threatening President Sali Berisha's government.</p>
<p>Sunday's showdown capped a week of minor demonstrations in Albania, sparked by the collapse of three dubious investment groups over the past three weeks, taking with them the life savings of hundreds of people.</p>
<p>The wrath of the Albanians follows that of millions of east Europeans who fell easy prey to dubious pyramid schemes which thrived on their hopes of beating poverty and inflation and their lack of knowledge of how financial markets work.</p>
<p>In a bid to defuse the crisis shaking his country -- the poorest in Europe -- Berisha has vowed to crack down on pyramid investment schemes.</p>
<p>Last week the Albanian government moved to seize some $255 million, deposited by investment schemes in the country's commercial banks. With no official estimates of the total losses, that might be just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Berisha's plight echoes that of post-communist governments in the region, where fledgling financial markets have been shaken by similar scandals in recent years.</p>
<p>Russian, Romanian, Bulgarian and even Czech investors who lost their money to collapsed pyramid schemes are blaming post-communist authorities for allowing firms to promise profits they could not deliver.</p>
<p>Offers of 200 percent returns over three months, beating inflation and bank rates, were an irresistible attraction to many poverty-stricken Albanians, hundreds of whom sold their homes, cattle or farms to deposit their money into pyramid schemes.</p>
<p>Albanian newspapers say that some $130 million in deposits garnered from those schemes may have been smuggled out of the country over the past few days.</p>
<p>In absolute terms the Albanian losses are small compared to two huge pyramid schemes which collapsed in Russia and Romania three years ago, each sucking in an estimated $1.0 billion worth of investors' deposits.</p>
<p>East European countries have no legal safeguards against pyramid schemes, which prosper "mathematically", paying old investors with the deposits of the new.</p>
<p>The systems collapse when they run short of new investors.</p>
<p>Such was the fate of Russia's MMM scheme, which tempted millions of Russians with promises of 3,000 percent interest.</p>
<p>Russian officials reckon that MMM sucked in $1 billion before it collapsed in 1994.</p>
<p>The same year some four million Romanians, lured by offers of eight-fold returns in three months, lost their savings into the Caritas pyramid scheme, which also sank with $1.0 billion.</p>
<p>Both schemes exploited gullible Russian and Romanian investors, at a time of spiralling inflation as their countries emerged from decades of communist isolation.</p>
<p>In 1995 Romania's newly-born securities market regulators issued warnings to investors against the spread of foreign-controlled pyramid schemes.</p>
<p>Learning the meaning of "once bitten, twice shy", angry Czechs vowed last year to sue a Russian businessman who told them in a newspaper advertisement that he had cheated them out of millions of dollars in his sunken investment fund.</p>
