<p>The Taiwan dollar closed unchanged against the U.S. dollar on Tuesday, as investors stepped to the sidelines to await results of the U.S. presidential and congressional elections, dealers said.</p>
<p>The local unit ended at T$27.501, the same as Monday's close. Turnover through dealers was a modest US$166 million.</p>
<p>"Investors have adopted a wait-and-see attitude before the U.S. elections," said one dealer.</p>
<p>"Also, the Taiwan dollar is in a situation that is insensitive to most factors now that it has cooled down after its sharp recent falls," he said.  </p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar had dipped as low as T$27.620 in intraday trade in late October, but has rebounded in that past week. In theory, the dealer said, the Taiwan dollar still has room for a depreciation because of a low Taiwan dollar interbank rate and a firming U.S. dollar overseas. But it has moved little.</p>
<p>"Both investors and banks alike recently seem to have had little interest in trading," he said.</p>
<p>For Wednesday, a T$27.48-27.52 range was seen.</p>
