<p>Turkey's first Islamist prime minister broke a prolonged silence to distance himself from a scandal over alleged state-backed death squads that the Kurdish opposition blamed for thousands of mystery killings.</p>
<p>"You cannot have a gang within the state...Nobody can be allowed to do anything illegal, with no exceptions," Erbakan told Turkish columnists in an interview widely published on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Erbakan was speaking in detail for the first time since a scandal over alleged "state gangs" in the underworld erupted last month following an accident in which a wanted gangster, Abdullah Catli, and a top policeman died in the same car.</p>
<p>A pro-Kurdish opposition party on Tuesday blamed state-sponsored gangs for some 3,500 unsolved murders in southeast Turkey, scene of a 12-year fight with the rebel Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).</p>
<p>"We can say these gangs have a direct links with mystery killings. This is no longer a hypothesis or a guess, this is a reality acknowledged by officials," Guven Ozata, a senior member of the People's Democracy Party (HADEP), told a news conference.</p>
<p>"The exact figure cannot be confirmed but, according to the Human Rights Association, since the middle of the 1980s around 3,500 people have fallen victim to mystery murders," Ozata said in Ankara.</p>
<p>Sedat Bucak, a government MP who heads Turkey's biggest private Kurdish militia in the fight with the PKK, was also in the car with Catli but survived with minor injuries.</p>
<p>"Nothing, including fighting the PKK, can be an excuse for a crime. If such things happen, those gangs, whatever their make-up, will be disbanded," said Erbakan in an apparent rebuff to comments by his deputy, Tansu Ciller, that anyone fighting for the state was a hero. Bucak is an MP for Ciller's party.</p>
<p>Ciller last week defended Catli, saying "those who fire bullets or suffer their wounds in the name of this country...will always be respectfully remembered by us."</p>
<p>Ciller had stressed that Catli had no confirmed convictions in Turkey. Catli had been on the run since the late 1970s, when he was accused of killing seven leftists in Ankara. He was also wanted by Interpol for his alleged role in the 1981 attack on the Pope and had been jailed -- and escaped -- in Switzerland for heroin trafficking.</p>
<p>Asked directly about Ciller's comments, Erbakan said: "Everyone is entitled to their own view."</p>
<p>"When he answered this question you could see from his face that he was not at all pleased by Ciller's attitude, but in his answer he was thinking of the coalition," wrote columnist Fatih Cekirge in the daily Sabah.</p>
<p>The scandal has rocked the government and cost Ciller her hardline interior minister, Mehmet Agar, who quit following the crash in the quiet western town of Susurluk amid allegations he knew of the relationship among the unlikely trio in the car.</p>
<p>But analysts say Ciller's stance during the scandal played into Erbakan's hands and strengthened the coalition, which the U.S.-educated former premier entered amid allegations of corruption against her. She needs backing from Erbakan -- whom she had vowed never to ally with -- to clear her name.</p>
