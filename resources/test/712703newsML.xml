<p>Shares in South Africa's Lenco Holdings Ltd fell sharply on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange early on Tuesday on news its talks with fellow packaging group Malbak Ltd had been called off.</p>
<p>By 0735 GMT Lenco had shed over six percent or 40 cents to 595 cents, making it the third biggest percentage loser on the bourse in early dealings.</p>
<p>Malbak was untraded at 690 cents.  </p>
<p>"The (Lenco) shares are off on the deal being called off," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Malbak said earlier that discussions which were taking place between itself and Lenco, which may have an effect on the Malbak share price have been terminated. No reasons were given for ending the talks.</p>
<p>Malbak acting chief executive Denzil McGlashan told Business Report newspaper that after evaluating the Lenco business it had been decided that it did not fit with Malbak.</p>
<p>"It's packaging interests are in areas in which we no longer operate, and re-entering this sector is not part of our larger game plan," McGlashan said.</p>
<p>The suspension of talks follow a flood of rumours in the market that industrial conglomerate Rembrandt Group Ltd (Remgro) was set to buy Malbak through its Lenco unit, or alternatively that Malbak was set to buy Lenco.</p>
<p>McGlashan said that Malbak aimed at growing locally and internationally by way of acquisition and organic growth, although opportunities for growth locally by purchase were limited.</p>
