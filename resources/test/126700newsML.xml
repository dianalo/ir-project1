<p>A huge inflow of Chinese-made toys and Christmas decorations during August limited the improvement in the U.S. trade deficit to a small one, the Commerce Department said Friday.</p>
<p>The gap between imports and exports worldwide narrowed 6.6 percent to $10.83 billion in August from $11.6 billion in July but was around $2 billion higher than analysts had anticipated.</p>
<p>It was partly overshadowed by a soaring 23 percent increase in the bilateral deficit with China to a record $4.71 billion as that country once again surpassed Japan as the leading contributor to persistent monthly U.S. trade gaps.</p>
<p>Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor blamed the rising China gap on "sanctuary markets" that block American-made goods from entering China and attempted to put the best face on the deteriorating trade picture.</p>
<p>"Our trade deficit with China is increasing at an ever decreasing rate," Kantor told reporters in a telephone conference, vowing to keep up the pressure on China to open its markets.</p>
<p>August marked only the second month in which China was the No. 1 contributor to the U.S. deficit. The other occasion was in June when a $3.3 billion shortfall was posted.</p>
<p>By contrast, the deficit with Japan fell in August by 11.8 percent to $3.8 billion.</p>
<p>Economists called the trade report disappointing and said it implied third-quarter economic growth slowed even more abruptly than anticipated because exports were not providing the boost to national activity that was expected.</p>
<p>"This will probably see third-quarter GDP (gross domestic product) expectations toned down," commented David Sloan of I.D.E.A. Inc. in New York, "I expect now we'll probably be back below 2 percent."</p>
<p>Republican presidential challenger Bob Dole used trade figures to lash out at the Clinton administration, claiming big monthly deficits "mean that thousands and thousands of American jobs are being given away to foreign countries."</p>
<p>Dole charged that Clinton's trade policy was "to sell out American workers and communities to the lowest bidder."</p>
<p>But financial markets were not dismayed, with the Dow Jones industrial index rising 35.03 points to another record close of 6,094.23, its fourth record for the week.</p>
<p>The inflation-sensitive 30-year Treasury bond edged up only fractionally in price, but dealers said it was buoyed by rising prospects that a slowing economy will head off more interest-rate rises since wage and price rises are being tamped down on their own.</p>
<p>Goods and services output, measured by GDP, expanded at a 4.7 percent annual rate in the second quarter but recent reports show it easing back substantially. Business inventories swelled in August while new-home building dropped in September and industrial output grew more slowly.</p>
<p>Federal Reserve policymakers believe a so-called trend growth rate around 2 percent to 2-1/4 percent will permit the economy to expand safely without generating strong inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>The United States typically runs a deficit in merchandise trade with the rest of the world that is partly offset by a surplus in services like tourism and insurance.</p>
<p>In August, the merchandise deficit grew 2.9 percent to $16.99 billion while the services surplus rose 4.4 percent to $6.15 billion.</p>
<p>Total exports rose 3 percent to $69.32 billion in August after falling 3.5 percent in July, while imports grew 1.6 percent to $80.15 billion after rising 1.3 percent in July.</p>
<p>Some of the rise in the August gap reflected retailers preparing for an expected strong Christmas shopping season by purchasing more toys and other seasonal goods made in China, analysts said.</p>
<p>Imports of toys and Christmas decorations from China jumped $301.8 million in August while clothing imports rose $86.9 million from July, the department said.</p>
<p>The deficit with Canada grew almost 42 percent to $2.59 billion while the gap with Mexico rose 11.3 percent to $1.54 billion.</p>
<p>There was major improvement in the trade deficit with Western Europe, which dropped 63.2 percent to $1.56 billion.</p>
<p>Exports of civilian aircraft rose $497 million to $1.35 billion in August. Analysts had said that Boeing Co. had strong shipments to overseas customers in August.</p>
<p>Imports of crude oil fell to $4.3 billion from $4.7 billion -- still a relatively high level as the price per barrel climbed to $18.65 from $18.24 in July.</p>
