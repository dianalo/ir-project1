<headline>Condoms airfreighted to Bhutan -- but how many?.</headline>
<text>
<p>NEW DELHI, March 10, Reuter - Druk-Air (Royal Bhutan Airlines) was due to freight six tonnes of condoms from India into its home airport in the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, (population 600,000), an airline agent said here Friday.</p>
<p>The condoms were due to leave Calcutta on Friday as part of the United Nations' Family Planning programme. The plane one of the airline's two British Aerospace 146-100 series, has been converted to just carrying cargo from its usual 72-seater configuration.</p>
<p>The usual minimum cargo rate from Delhi to Paro is $3 per kilo but rates for special cargoes are negotiable and the airline agent declined to divulge the rate for the condom shipment or the actual number as they only charge by weight.</p>
