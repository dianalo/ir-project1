<p>A top U.S. pork industry official said news that Taiwan had banned pork exports because of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the island's hog herd could increase pork export opportunities for the U.S. but that it was too early to say to what degree.</p>
<p>"This is an important event but we don't know the significance until we know all the facts," said Al Tank, chief executive officer of the National Pork Producers Council.</p>
<p>"If true, it would be a very significant development that clearly the United States, Denmark and Canada would be the greatest beneficiaries of," Tank said.  </p>
<p>The Taiwan Council of Agriculture announced on Thursday it was banning all exports of fresh and frozen pork temporarily due to an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease among hogs in nine counties and 20 breeding farms.</p>
<p>Taiwan's domestic pork prices plummeted on the news and officials said curbing the highly contagious disease would be hampered by shortages of vaccines in Taiwan.</p>
<p>Taiwan's $3 billion dollar pork industry is one of the country's top export sectors. Taiwan holds a 45-percent share of the Japanese pork import market, followed by the U.S. at 23 percent, Tank said.  </p>
<p>Taiwanese officials said that Japan had been importing about 16,000 tonnes of Taiwanese fresh and frozen pork per month despite Japan's tariff on pork exports since July, 1996.</p>
<p>"Until we know how long the ban will take place, it would be too premature to anticipate what will happen to exports," Tank said.</p>
<p>At the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Thursday, futures prices on lean hog carcasses and pork bellies shot up for limit gains early in response to the Taiwan news, with traders citing the clear opportunity for stepped-up Japanese bookings of U.S. pork to make up for the Taiwanese shipments.  </p>
<p>CME pork belly futures for May delivery were locked up the 3.00-cent-per-lb limit at 76.30 cents and hogs for June delivery were locked up the 2.00-cent-per-lb limit at 78.150 cents in midmorning trade.</p>
<p>The U.S. in 1996 shipped 183,193 tonnes of pork and pork variety meats to Japan, the U.S.'s biggest pork export customer, valued at $755.8 million, Tank said.</p>
<p>The 1996 U.S. pork shipments to Japan were 36 percent greater than the previous year's 134,246 tonnes, USDA and U.S. Meat Export Federation statistics showed.</p>
<p>Total U.S. pork exports in 1996 were 413,166, up 13 percent from 1995, USDA reported.</p>
<p>Taiwan shipped 326,000 tonnes, according to their statistics, Tank said.</p>
<p>Tank said he did not expect the news from Taiwan to spur Japan to change its tariff, which controls the amount of pork imports, until the end of June.</p>
<p>The tariff, which is allowed by world trade rules as a way for Japan to control a flood of meat imports, was orignally slated to be lifted April 1. However, earlier this month it was extended by Japan's agriculture ministry.</p>
