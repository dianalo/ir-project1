<p>Most Irish people living in Britain have faced insults, hurtful jokes and intimidating behaviour because of their origins, the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Although only 20 percent reported a 'bad atmosphere' at work, 79 percent had been subjected to abusive and insulting anti-Irish jokes and remarks," the CRE said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The majority of those questioned could immediately identify instances of behaviour which they had found insulting, hurtful or intimidating."</p>
<p>The CRE urged employers to ensure their equal opportunity policies included people of Irish origin, who make up Britain's largest ethnic minority by immigration.</p>
<p>Irish-born and their children are estimated to form 4.6 percent of the population of Britain and 11.5 percent of the population of greater London.</p>
<p>Most of the Irish-born belong to the most deprived social classes and have lower than average rates of upward mobility and rates of car ownership well below average, said the CRE.</p>
<p>Male Irish unemployment in Britain is above average and their health in middle age below average.</p>
<p>Despite a long and large presence in Britain, especially in its inner cities, Irish immigrants often find themselves the butt of English jokes, stereotyped as ignorant and drink-sodden.</p>
<p>"Britain has been a place of welcome and opportunity for many Irish people," said the CRE. "Yet in spite of this visible integration, there is evidence of inequality, discrimination and prejudice."</p>
<p>The independent body said the increasingly positive attitudes in Britain towards Irish culture offered an opportunity for improved race relations.</p>
