<p>North Sea Brent crude barrels fetched weaker prices late Thursday in U.S. aftermarket dealings, traders said.</p>
<p>July Brent declined around 10 cents in extremely thin volumes. Partial cargoes traded for 100 lots at $20.10, eight cents weaker than the IPE settlement at $20.18 a barrel.</p>
<p>Other deals were seen for July Brent paper at $20.09 for a total of 200 lots in two separate trades, 200 lots moved at $20.07 and 150 more at $20.08.</p>
<p>The grand total for outright deals amounted to 650 lots in six deals, and featured a Wall Street trader selling most of the crude to a U.S. refiner.</p>
<p>An inter-month spread deal for a full cargo moved in June/July at plus seven cents, a shade stronger than markings earlier in London.</p>
