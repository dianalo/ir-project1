<p>The Bangladesh taka edged up to 42.5380/42.5480 despite losing early gains on demand for the dollar in interbank trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>The taka quoted at 42.5300/42.5450 against dollar in early trading compared with the previous closing at 42.5450/42.5500.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was little activity in the morning session due to weekend closure of most international markets but the demand for dollars by certain banks, seeking to keep long positions, picked up later.</p>
<p>The interbank call money rates closed at 4.0 percent to 4.75 percent against the previous 4.5-5.0 percent, dealers said.</p>
