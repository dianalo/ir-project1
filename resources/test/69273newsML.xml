<p>The China Minsheng Banking Corp, China's first privately run bank under communist rule, is aiming to expand to booming cities in the east and south, the China Daily Business Weekly said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Minsheng would open branches in eastern Shanghai and southern Guangzhou by the end of this year, the newspaper quoted bank president Tong Zengyin as saying.</p>
<p>The bank would also open three sub-branches in Beijing, Tong said. The bank now has two branches, both in Beijing.</p>
<p>Minsheng was looking to move into other regions such as Chengdu, capital of the southwestern province of Sichuan, or coastal cities, the newspaper quoted other bank officials as saying.</p>
<p>"The bank will definitely fulfill its goal of increasing its financial capital to 5.0 billion yuan with deposits of 3.5 billion yuan during its first year of operation," it quoted Tong as saying.</p>
<p>The bank, set up in January, had a start-up capital of 1.38 billion yuan, it said.</p>
