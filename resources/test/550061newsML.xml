<headline>Bucharest first-tier share prices, turnover climb.</headline>

<text>
<p>The Bucharest stock exchange's four first-tier listings held centre-stage on Wednesday amid a bullish sentiment which has centred on high-caps since last week.</p>
<p>Heavy trading and higher prices sent two independent indices to year highs for the sixth consecutive session.</p>
<p>Three of the four heavyweights climbed, with Azomures fertiliser maker racing ahead with a 43 percent rise in its average price to 3,676 lei. It closed higher at 3,800.</p>
<p>Accepted average price variation is plus/minus 50 percent.</p>
<p>"After the special trade last week investors realised that Azomures shares are worth buying," a trader said. They are still cheap and promise nice returns. So, there was a rush."</p>
<p>Last week, Azomures had a large trade outside the market worth more than 20 billion lei.</p>
<p>The other first-tier chemical plant, Oltchim, gained 38 percent in its average price to 2,430 lei and closed firmer at 2,550.</p>
<p>Of the tier's two pharmaceuticals companies, Terapia rose 500 lei to close at 4,600, while Antibiotice lost 50 lei to end at 4,600.</p>
<p>Volumes increased ahead of Labour Day on May 1, when the stock exchange is closed, with turnover climbing to 8.37 billion lei from the previous 5.15 billion. The first tier took almost 95 percent of turnover.</p>
<p>Brokers said the rally might carry over to next week, when first-tier prices and turnover are expected to touch new highs.</p>
<p>Second-tier activity was sluggish, with eight stocks suspended and three companies having no trade.</p>
<p>Policolor dye maker outshone the 28 other listings, with 219.9 million lei in turnover and a closing quote 475 lei stronger at 3,000.</p>
<p>The VAB and BIG unofficial indices rose by 23 and 23.17 percent respectively from the previous session. The BIG first-tier index rose by 27.21 percent to 3,131.62 points.</p>
