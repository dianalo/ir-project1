<p>What does a country that has the world's biggest movie industry do when its cinema halls start to shut down faster than you can say "clapper board"?</p>
<p>Long used to thronging thousands at movie halls, Indian cinema owners are bracing for a slowdown caused by an assault from television and home videos and doing something they never had to do before -- selling themselves.</p>
<p>On offer now are dressed-up decor, snazzier projection, smaller theatres for niche audiences and plenty of food and drinks to match a feast for the eyes.</p>
<p>Of India's 13,000 cinemas, at least 1,000 have already closed due to losses, said Rajan Gupta, owner of Liberty cinema in the Indian capital and president of the National Association of Motion Picture Exhibitors.</p>
<p>At least five major cinema halls in New Delhi have closed in the past seven years and nearly half of the 72 cinema owners have asked for permission to close, Gupta said.</p>
<p>"There has not been any increase in the total number of cinema halls in New Delhi in the last decade although the population of the city has increased by millions," said Joginder Sahni, owner of Plaza cinema in the heart of New Delhi.</p>
<p>Rajesh Khanna, owner of Chanakya cinema said: "Cable and satellite channels have adversely affected ticket sales but one has to fight them with innovative ways. It's a question of survival."</p>
<p>And surviving they are.</p>
<p>THE COMING OF THE MULTIPLEX</p>
<p>Four cinemas in the Indian capital have already spruced up their interiors, while the first multiplex (several cinema halls in one huge mall) opened its doors on June 3.</p>
<p>Chanakya, which has a regular English movie fare, has upgraded its projection and sound facilities and plans to improve some of the other technical facilities, Khanna said.</p>
<p>Shailesh Podar of Priya Entertainment, a popular Delhi cinema that is also opening a four-cinema multiplex later this month, said the only way to lure back the movie buffs was by offering better facilities in an attractive package.</p>
<p>"We are going to cater to a family's night out -- we'll offer them a choice of movies, a nice place to have dinner, games for the kids and a very quiet and classy ambience," Podar said.</p>
<p>The cinema owners are hoping to cash in on a marked increase in the disposable income of Indians after the country launched a sweeping economic reform programme in 1991, dismantling a decades-old socialist system for a market-driven economy.</p>
<p>"People have the money and they don't mind paying a price for quality products," Khanna said.</p>
<p>India's first multiplex, Priya Village Roadshow, a joint venture between the Priya group and Australian cinema operator Village Roadshow Ltd, offers a choice of films, good restaurants and a video game parlour.</p>
<p>The multiplex will also cater to the serious film watcher as the small auditoriums with 150 seats will be economically more sustainable for such films, Podar said.</p>
<p>"The smaller cinemas can offer more films in the same space, making the business more profitable," he said. "BOLLYWOOD" STRUGGLES WITH ECONOMICS</p>
<p>Rajiv Maheshwari, a celluloid addict, says the concept of a multiplex is bound to be a hit with Delhi's nouveau riche. "It will have a status symbol attached to it," said Maheshwari.</p>
<p>Cinema is the chief form of mass entertainment in India, where matinee stars are often revered as demigods. The country is home to the world's biggest film industry, with more than 800 films churned out by "Bollywood" every year.</p>
<p>But the number of films has been steadily declining, said Gupta.</p>
<p>"Some people have woken up to the reality that for every movie that's a box-office hit, there are nearly 20 flops," Gupta said.</p>
<p>He said cinema owners were renovating, not because they wanted to but because they had to.</p>
<p>"There is always this film festival audience, specially amongst the older generation, who stand for hours in long queues to see good, serious cinema. They will definitely be regulars for any good films on show," said Seema Bawa, a cinema critic.</p>
