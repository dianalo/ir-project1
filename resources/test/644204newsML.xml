<p>Interior ministers of Germany's 16 federal states said on Friday they had agreed to put the Church of Scientology under coordinated nationwide observation by the federal and state anti-extremist watchdogs.</p>
<p>Two large southern German states, Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg, have already been carrying out surveillance on Scientology, which has accused Germany of persecuting it and its members.  </p>
<p>The interior ministers, meeting for a two-day conference in Bonn, said they had decided that the group, which Germany sees as a profit-making organisation, not a religion, met the legal conditions necessary for observation.</p>
<p>"With Scientology there are really clues of efforts against the basic liberal-democratic order and therefore the legal prerequisite for an observation of the organisation by the protectorate of the constitution," the interior ministry of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern said in a statement.</p>
<p>Scientology, which is based on the teachings of late American science fiction writer L. Ron Hubbard, has accused Germany of mounting a "hysterical witchhunt" against it at taxpayers' expense.</p>
<p>The states said the federal and state anti-extremist watchdogs would be asked to develop a joint working concept on how best to observe the group and present a report to the interior ministers' conference in a year.</p>
