<p>The shareholders committee of the California Jockey Club alleged on Thursday that the company had filed a document containing "serious departures from the truth."</p>
<p>The shareholders cited a document issued by the company August 27 stating that the committee advocated selling the company's real estate holdings.</p>
<p>"Their suggestion that we advocated selling real estate is false," said Thomas Loran, a laywer for the committee.</p>
<p>Christopher Kaufman, outside counsel to CJC, said the company had no comment on the allegation.</p>
<p>The committee has fielded a five-member slate of candidates in Friday's board election.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GAMCO Investors Inc said on Thursday it plans to support the current board in the election.</p>
<p>GAMCO is the largest single shareholder in CJC with 7.3 percent of the company's shares, Kaufman said.</p>
<p>"We're disappointed because GAMCO had given us proxies in the last several weeks, which indicated that GAMCO supported us in the board election," Loran said.</p>
