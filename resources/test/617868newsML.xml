<p>Belgian holding company Electrafina, part of group GBL, said on Tuesday the higher weight of the media sector in its portfolio and the sale last year of its stake in utility holding company Tractebel SA would affect current earnings and its dividend payout capacity.</p>
<p>Belgian financier Albert Frere, chairman of Electrafina and head of group GBL, told Electrafina shareholders that furthermore the increase of cash reserves in a climate of low interest rates and the investment in new assets "can only reinforce this phenomenon in the near future".</p>
<p>Despite this the capital gain realised on the sale of its Tractebel stake and of some assets of American Cometra would allow Electrafina to continue "a generous dividend policy" in the coming financial years, he said.</p>
<p>However, concern about shareholders' income had to be within the limits of sound financial management. In the short run payouts should not exceed current cash income, he said.</p>
<p>Dividend on 1996 earnings was increased by two francs to 142 francs gross per share, reaching a total 4.8 billion francs.</p>
<p>Frere said that the sale of production assets in Texas of American Cometra to Lomak of the U.S. for $400 million would lead to a five billion franc gain in 1997.</p>
