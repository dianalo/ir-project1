<p>While Germany has generally been slow to jump on the global Internet bandwagon, individuals and companies have been racing into cyberspace over the past few months.</p>
<p>Hardly a day goes by without one of the country's leading industrial companies, publishers or broadcasters staking a claim on the World Wide Web, the graphical part of the Internet computer network that is quickly becoming a global marketplace.</p>
<p>Although Germans have trailed the United States in developing Internet technology and services, telephone giant Deutsche Telekom has created a digital highway that is expanding fast.</p>
<p>Last year telecommunications officials were still joking about the digital ISDN network, saying the clumsy acronym stood for "It Still Does Nothing". No one is laughing now.</p>
<p>In three years Deutsche Telekom has transformed its Integrated Services Digital Network from a hybrid solution for companies in need of fast communications into a mass market that is spurring the development of multimedia applications.</p>
<p>"We broke through the sound barrier of one million connections six months ago," Detlev Buchal, Telekom board member, said on Wednesday at the CeBIT Home trade fair in Hanover. "I am confident that we will reach a total of two million this year."</p>
<p>The ISDN network uses digital instead of analogue signals to carry data, voice, image and fax communications over ordinary telephone wires.</p>
<p>While high-speed modems carry data at speeds of 28,800 bits per second, a single ISDN channel uses rates of 64,000 bits and two channels can be combined for transfer rates of 128,000 bits per second.</p>
<p>ISDN is a far cry from the so-called broadband networks that telecommunications gurus say will create the Information Society of the next century.</p>
<p>But it is a wider road that allows innovative services now -- such as video conferencing on personal computers which is not possible over analogue lines.</p>
<p>While generally impressed with Telekom's achievement, critics say ISDN is outdated and will be overtaken by new developments such as Internet access over cable TV networks, or broadband networks being built by Telekom's rivals.</p>
<p>"Others can roll out new technology if they want. ISDN will be around for a long time," said Buchal in response to such comments.</p>
<p>After European countries agreed a common standard for ISDN in 1993, Telekom began an aggressive roll-out of the service in Germany.</p>
<p>At first, orders trickled in from businesses. But during the first half of this year, Telekom subsidised ISDN connections and cut prices for the service, sparking rapid growth and creating a residential market for digital services.</p>
<p>Demand was for ISDN was so high that there is a waiting list for new connections well into next year.</p>
<p>Now 40 percent of its 1.7 million basic ISDN connections are in the residential and small business market, a fact that has led online services such as America Online and Microsoft Network to move quickly to offer ISDN access to their commercial online services.</p>
<p>The ISDN boom has also benefited Telekom's own online service, T-Online, which with around 1.2 million subscribers claims to be Europe's biggest online service and serves as an entry to the Internet for 600,000 of its members.</p>
<p>Nearly one-third of T-Online users dial into the service over the ISDN network. Even at weekends, when T-Online's traditional business subscriber is out of the office, ISDN access to the service is as high as 20 percent.</p>
<p>Wolfgang Keuntje, managing director of Online Pro Dienste GmbH, the umbrella company for T-Online, said Telekom would extend its Internet infrastructure. Despite a decision not to buy into the recently closed Europe Online, T-Online would expand beyond Germany.</p>
<p>"We will certainly become European," he said.</p>
