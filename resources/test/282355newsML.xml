<p>DAGENS NYHETER</p>
<p>- Hoarding of drugs over the past two months ahead of price increases in the New Year has cost the state at least a billion crowns, according to the chemist owners' association figures. Sales of prescription drugs in November and December rose by five percent.</p>
<p>- Sweden's population this year only increased by 8,000 to 8,845,249 which is the smallest increase in 14 years. Figures show this was mainly due a fall in the number of births.</p>
<p>- 1996 was a record year on the Stockholm bourse. Shares worth 916 billion crowns were traded which was an increase of 38 percent on 1995 with trading boosted by falling interest rates and rising company profits. The general index closed at a record high on Monday, the last trading day of 1996.</p>
<p>SVENSKA DAGBLADET</p>
<p>- The New Year is expected to be a good year for the car industry in Sweden with large orders expected in January and February when companies are affected by new company car rules. The total volume is expected for the first time in five years to pass 200,000, a newspaper survey of the country's biggest car importers found.</p>
<p>- Carl Bildt, leader of the opposition conservative party, the Moderates, writes in a column that the government's refusal to come clean on possible membership of Europe's Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) has left people confused and is doing nothing to clarify the issue.</p>
<p>- Sweden's population may not reach nine million by the year 2000 as previously thought after slower than expected growth in 1996, population monitors says. The Central Statistics Bureau (SCB) shows a rise of just 8,000 this year.</p>
<p>- Managing director of Volvo Cars in Sweden, Peter Hansson, expects companies to buy larger cars in 1997 when the new rules on company cars comes into effect. Volvo expects to sell 50,000 cars in Sweden next year and 10,000 Renault models, he says.</p>
