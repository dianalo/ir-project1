<p>The South African government said on Monday that it planned to sell a 30 percent stake in state telecommunications concern Telkom to a consortium of SBC Communications Inc and Telekom Malaysia Bhd.  </p>
<p>The Ministry for Posts, Telecommunications and Broadcasting said it would commence final negotiations for the sale of the strategic stake with the two companies following the closure of bidding last Friday.</p>
<p>The final outcome is expected on schedule by early April.  </p>
<p>The ministry said France Telecom had expressed a desire to continue to participate in the partial privatisation but present negotiations would proceed solely with SBC and Telekom Malaysia.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telecom -- seen by many analysts as a leading contender for the stake -- failed to submit a bid, it said.  </p>
<p>A full announcement on the financial details of the transaction, as well as details on commitments to roll-out and transformation of the service, would only be made once negotiations are concluded, the ministry added.</p>
<p>Analysts have estimated the value of the 30 percent stake at over six billion rand, valuing Telkom at more than $4 billion, making the it the largest privatisation in Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p>The sale of Telkom shares is the first major step in the South African government's privatisation drive.</p>
