<p>A serial killer whose victims are all young women is on the rampage in Shanghai and is being hunted by police, a police spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>Rumours circulating in China's biggest city say at least 10 women have been murdered so far, but the official said he was not able to reveal the figure.</p>
<p>"They are all females, no men," the Public Security Bureau official said by telephone.</p>
<p>According to some rumours, the victims were young women with long hair. Others say they also all carried fashionable knapsacks.</p>
<p>The official declined to say how the victims were killed or to reveal any other details of the case.</p>
<p>"I can't tell you," he said.</p>
<p>But he confirmed the killer was still at large.</p>
<p>A senior police source said there would probably be an announcement on the case in the next day or two.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an official in a police bureau in the Yangpu district in northeast Shanghai said he was aware of "one of two cases" of murder.</p>
<p>"But we're not sure how they are linked," he said.</p>
<p>China's official media have yet to make any reference to the murders, and police rarely make such matters public before cases have been fully resolved.</p>
<p>An official in the Baoshan district of northeast Shanghai, where most of the murders are rumoured to have taken place, said she knew of no such case.</p>
<p>"There must be some mistake," she said. "Nothing like that has happened."</p>
<p>A 42-year-old truck driver was executed in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong in 1995 after being found guilty of murdering 12 young women between 1990 and 1994.</p>
<p>The man strangled them, raped their corpses and then dismembered the bodies.</p>
