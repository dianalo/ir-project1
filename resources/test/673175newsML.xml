<p>Wall Sreet stocks barrelled higher into record territory Thursday with the Dow Jones industrial average topping the 7,800 mark for the first time.</p>
<p>The 30-stock blue chip average was up 87.30 points to 7,806.01 in late afternoon trading amid bullishness on Wall Street that overcame a stronger-than-expected report on the economy.</p>
<p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index was up 10.54 points to 899.60, also in record territory, while the Nadaq index gained 15.56 to 1,447.99.</p>
<p>Several analysts said the gains reflected Wall Street's pervasive bullish mood, which was boosted in the morning when Prudential market analyst Ralph Acompora raised his already-high targets for the Dow to 10,000 in one year.</p>
<p>"A lot of this is triple-witching," said one trader, referring to Friday's simulataneous expiration of futures and indexes. "A lot of people are short out there ... and they have to buy stock to replace them when they expire. That's causing a run-up," he said.</p>
