<p>CBOT March soymeal futures set an 8-1/2 year high for a nearby contract and old crop months ended limit up amid ideas USDA will further cut 1996-97 soybean ending stocks in Tuesday's crop report, traders said.</p>
<p>Analysts predicted USDA would shave 10 million to 15 million bushels off of an already tight estimate for 140 million bushels of soybeans.</p>

<p>Soyoil was also strongly higher on spillover strength from soybeans and soymeal. Funds were buyers on the day.</p>
