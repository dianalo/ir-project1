<dateline>TOKYO 1997-03-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Japan announced on Monday a package of measures aimed at boosting liquidity in Japan's land market.</p>
<p>They include the easing of rules to allow the securitisation of collateralised real estate, as well as the use of public money and deregulation to promote urban development.  </p>
<p>The government said bodies such as the Housing Loan Administration Corp, which administers the debts of failed "jusen" housing loan firms, would present a list of property worth a total of round 380 billion yen to the government to be considered for development for public purposes.  </p>
<p>The following are the main points of the scheme:</p>
<p>1) Securitisation of collateralised real estate.</p>
<p>a) Measures involving trust banks to be implemented immediately.</p>
<p>- designating trust certificates on real estate business loans as "securities" under the Securities and Exchange Law to increase liquidity, reliability and investor protection.</p>
<p>b) Measures involving special-purpose companies to be implemented in fiscal 1998/99.</p>
<p>- easing of business regulations including the possibility of establishing new law for special-purpose companies.</p>
<p>c) Review of taxes aimed at promoting securitisation of bad assets. Taxes to be reviewed include those relating to trust banks and special-purpose companies.</p>
<p>d) Promoting use of insurance offered by non-life insurance companies.  </p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance said the government aims to do the following:</p>
<p>- in future securitise real estate with the aim of promoting investment by investment funds.</p>
<p>- ease regulations so that securitisation will be carried out simply, inexpensively and in a variety of forms to help banks solve their bad-loan problems and promote liquidity of land held as collateral in line with "Big Bang" financial reforms to be completed by the year 2001.</p>
<p>- ensure that investors are adequately protected and promote investment from abroad under the new Foreign Exchange Law.  </p>
<p>2) Measures to help improve integration of small tracts of land into larger sites.</p>
<p>a) Easing regulations, including zoning restrictions, and utilise private bodies such as the Organisation for Promoting Urban Development to buy land for development.</p>
<p>b) Using public money to purchase land held as collateral for public purposes.</p>
<p>A list of property worth around 380 billion yen will be presented to the government by bodies such the Housing Loan Administration Corp, the Resolution and Collection Bank and the Cooperative Credit Purchasing Co.</p>
<p>The land will be used to develop welfare facilities for the aged, day-care centres, sports centres and parks.</p>
<p>3) Measures to sort out the various rights to collateral for land so that auctions of land can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>4) The establishment of a database of Japanese real estate held as collateral and improving land appraisal methods.</p>
<p>Separately, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said on Monday that Japan was not in a situation now to consider a further increase in the consumption tax.</p>
<p>"An increase in the consumption tax is theoretically possible, but Japan is not in a situation now to consider a further increase," he told a news conference.</p>
<p>He was replying to a question on whether he was considering another increase after the consumption tax is raised to five percent from three percent on Tuesday.</p>
