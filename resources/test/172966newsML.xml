<p>The U.S. Beef Promotion Operating Committee (BPOC) has approved $150,000 to spend in Japan promoting the safety and wholesomeness of U.S. beef, the committee said in a statement.</p>
<p>The BPOC said the money would be spent on advertising, trade education seminars and public relations efforts promoting the safety of U.S. beef. Consumption of beef and other foods dropped sharply in Japan after an outbreak this year of E.coli bacteria.</p>
<p>An additional $2.33 million has been pooled from the U.S. Agriculture Department, export companies and meat and grain producers to promote food safety in Japan, the statement said.</p>
<p>The $150,000 allocation was approved this week and will be administered in Japan by the U.S. Meat Export Federation. The federation is currently conducting food safety seminars in Japan promoting U.S. beef.</p>
<p>The BPOC is an independent group appointed to administer funds collected through the U.S. beef checkoff program.</p>
<p>The E.coli outbreak has not been linked to beef, but the meat export federation has said it damaged Japanese consumer confidence in the safety of several food items including fish, raw vegetables and imported meat.</p>
