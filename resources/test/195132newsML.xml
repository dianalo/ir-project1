<p>LAC VERT, Zaire - Below a portrait of former Rwandan President Juvenal Habyarimana lie discarded clothes, unused syringes and contraceptive pills -- the last taken on Friday, the day Hutu fighters abandoned this former training camp.</p>
<p>Two days later the camp displays the relics of total panic and a massive stampede as the mixed band of ex-Rwandan army troops and dreaded Interahamwe militia fled westwards into the bush before a fierce onslaught from Zairean rebels.</p>
<p>In the road lie abandoned cars, trucks and buses hit by mortar fire.</p>
<p>Their flight was the catalyst for the return of hundreds of thousands of Hutu refugees to Rwanda -- the homeland they fled in panic after a Tutsi-led government won power in 1994.</p>
<p>The gunmen, chief culprits for the slaughter of up to one million people, mostly Tutsis, in Rwanda's Hutu-led 1994 genocide, convinced or forced hundreds of thousands of fellow Hutus they would face reprisals.</p>
<p>The genocide was sparked by the death of Habyarimana, a Hutu hardliner, when his plane was shot out of the sky as he landed in Kigali in April 1994. Many ordinary Hutus took part or stood by as extremists butchered their Tutsi neighbours.</p>
<p>The fighters' two-year hold on the nearby Mugunga camp was broken by a lightning strike through eastern Zaire by the rebels, who have close links with Rwanda, four weeks ago.</p>
<p>Today, the atmosphere is surreal.</p>
<p>Discarded military boots and identity cards and piles of military uniforms reveal how the militia stripped off their kit to try to hide among the returning refugees.</p>
<p>The ground is covered with live ammunition, mortar rounds, anti-tank mines, documents and hundreds of thousands of condoms. On the corpse of a former Rwandan soldier, shot in the head, lies a "Complete Introduction to Biology" text book.</p>
<p>Strewn women's underwear, gas masks, text books and thousands of documents in French and Kinyarwanda detailing two years of military training, political ideology and reports of insurgency activity into Rwanda.</p>
<p>On the floor of the camp lay the bodies of five people, killed as they fled the advancing rebels -- a mixture of Zaire's Banyamulenge Tutsis, Rwandan volunteers and opponents of ailing Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>In the background loom the hills of the Masisi, where the Hutu militia and former government forces have fled, pursued by the Rwandan army and Zairean rebels from Goma.</p>
<p>East of Mugunga towards Goma, the flow of returning refugees is thinning out, although an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 have yet to cross the border back into Rwanda, according to the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR.</p>
<p>On the road westwards towards Sake, old men, women and children are dying. A Reuters correspondent on Sunday counted 13 bodies of those who had died of exhaustion, dehydration or disease.</p>
<p>The only help available to these people struggling towards Rwanda is from local workers of the International Commission of the Red Cross (ICRC), who are picking up the wounded and dying and taking them back to Goma.</p>
<p>They are overwhelmed by the sheer size of the exodus. On one 14-km (nine-mile) stretch of road from Goma westwards into Zaire, not one single vehicle or official from any aid organisation could be seen.</p>
