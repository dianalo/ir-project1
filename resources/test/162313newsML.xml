<p>The Venezuelan government reiterated that windfall oil revenues will only be used to repay the country's foreign debt.</p>
<p>Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff was quoted in the local press Sunday as saying that "to use this money for other local purposes would fuel inflation."</p>
<p>Government officials have said that higher-than-budgeted oil prices boosted by recent tension in the Middle East will bring in windfall revenues of up to $3.0 billion this year.</p>
<p>Petkoff said the money will go "to the special debt repayment fund; to put it in circulation ... would only fuel inflation."</p>
<p>Venezuela's inflation rate was 4.2 percent in October, up from 3.6 percent in September but below a 12.6 percent peak in May, following the launch mid-April of an IMF-backed economic adjustment program.</p>
