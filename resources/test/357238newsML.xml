<p>Spot prices of most U.S. refined products were moderately lower late Wednesday tracking futures, although differentials on U.S. Gulf Coast low sulfur diesel and conventional unleaded gasoline firmed on refiner buying, players said.</p>
<p>Back third cycle USG low sulfur diesel was sold for 0.75 cent over the March print, about 0.40 cent firmer than Tuesday diffs, traders said.</p>
<p>"Low sulfur was the hot ticket this morning," one Gulf player said, although others noted that activity slackened in the afternoon, leaving late-day offers about 0.35 cent firmer than Tuesday.</p>
<p>Traders said Gulf low sulfur diffs were helped by high premiums for California grade (CARB) diesel prices, with some players considering shipping the distillate out West.</p>
<p>California diesel prices rose nine percent last week following unexpected shutdowns of two diesel-making units. On Tuesday West Coast traders priced CARB diesel between 85 and 87 cents a gallon, over 20 cents higher than prompt barrels in the Gulf.</p>
