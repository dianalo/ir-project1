<p>The spot electricity market Wednesday remained in the doldrums amid flat power demand due to normal to lower-than-normal temperatures in the region, market sources said.</p>
<p>Most marketers said short-term physical trading was featureless because of subdued buying interest.</p>
<p>Regional utilities have been able to meet current usage levels with production mainly from coal and nuclear stations, thusly keeping generation costs low, marketers said.</p>
<p>"The coal units are running in the mid-teens," noted one local utility trader, referring to the average per-megawatt- hour generation costs of the region's coal-fired power plants.</p>
<p>In the East Central Area Reliability Coordination Agreement (ECAR), non-firm, peak electricity for Thursday delivery was quoted at $18.00-$19.00 per megawatt hour (MWh), flat from Tuesday's values.</p>
<p>Non-firm, off-peak ECAR power for next-day delivery was discussed in the $11.00-$13.00, near unchanged from Tuesday.</p>
<p>Next-day electricity for delivery at the border of ECAR and the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnect power pool was offered in the $23.00 area, compared with $22.00-$23.00 on Monday.</p>
<p>In the Mid-American Interpool Network (MAIN), non-firm, peak power prices for Thursday were assessed at $20.00-$21.00, flat from Tuesday.</p>
<p>MAIN power for non-firm, off-peak delivery Thursday was valued at $11.00-$13.00, unchanged from Tuesday's quotes. In the Mid-Continent Area Power Pool (MAPP), non-firm, peak electricity for Thursday was quoted at $17.50-$19.00, compared with Tuesday's $18.00-$19.00 range.</p>
<p>MAPP electricity for non-firm, off-peak delivery was pegged at $10.00-$12.00, up from Tuesday's $9.00-$11.00.</p>
<p>In the Southwest Power Pool (SPP), non-firm, peak electricity for Thursday was assessed at $18.00-$19.00 with deals reported at $18.20, compared with Tuesday's quotes in the $18.00 area.</p>
<p>Fourth-quarter 1996 SPP deals were heard done today in the $18.50-$18.60 range, marketers said.</p>
<p>The ECAR district includes Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, lower Michigan, western Pennsylvania, northern Tennessee and northwestern Virginia.</p>
<p>The MAPP region is made up of Nebraska, Minnesota, the Dakotas, eastern Montana and western Wisconsin, and the MAIN district includes Illinois, northeastern Missouri, eastern Wisconsin and the Michigan pennisula.</p>
<p>The SPP region includes Kansas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas, parts of eastern and northern Texas, southeastern New Mexico, southwestern Missouri and western Mississippi.</p>
