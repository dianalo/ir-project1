<p>Construction of U.S.-based Eastman Chemical Company's copolyester plant in Malaysia is expected to be completed by November 1997, the national Bernama news agency reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Construction is about 20 percent complete, and the plant is scheduled to be on-stream in early 1998," Bernama quoted Wayne Burchette, the project's engineering and construction manager as saying.</p>
<p>In a statement issued by the company in Kuala Lumpur, Burchette said the engineering, drafting and procurement activities for the plant were nearly complete.</p>
<p>One of the plastics to be produced at the plant, Spectar copolyester, is being marketed as a replacement for acrylic and polycarbonate sheets, Bernama said.</p>
<p>Sheets made from Spectar are used in signs and architectural products, said the agency.</p>
