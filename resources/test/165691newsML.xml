<p>German second-division side Eintracht Frankfurt, already in the red, was thrown into crisis on Tuesday when its chairman and treasurer quit after alleged tax problems involving former captain Tony Yeboah.</p>
<p>Eintracht chairman Hans-Joachim Otto and treasurer Bernd Thate resigned their positions after less than a month at the troubled club which was relegated from the first division last season and is around seven million marks ($4.63 million) in debt.</p>
<p>Eintracht managing director Detlef Romeiko said Frankfurt public prosecutors were investigating tax irregularities relating to alleged payments made to Ghanaian forward Yeboah, believed to be around two million marks ($1.32 million).</p>
<p>Yeboah, who left the club under a cloud two seasons ago and now plays for English premier league side Leeds United, did not want to comment on the affair on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But sources close to the player said: "If it comes to court, it's Tony Yeboah who is going to be at the centre of it and he is prepared to defend himself."</p>
<p>The board said it had no knowledge of any payments to Yeboah and did not know how long the investigation would last.</p>
<p>But the club said in a statement: "The current board of Eintracht Frankfurt is not in a position to introduce its planned restructuring programme in the near future to secure a basis for the sporting and economic development of the club."</p>
<p>The investigation involved four people, it added.</p>
<p>The announcement comes as bad news for Eintracht fans who have watched their team slip from first division title contenders and European campaigners at the start of the 1990s to their current position in the bottom half of the second division.</p>
<p>Eintracht, which won the UEFA Cup in 1980, was one of the founding members of the Bundesliga in 1963. It was a shock to Germany's financial centre when it was relegated. Now it could be in danger of losing its professional status.</p>
<p>Only last month Bernd Hoelzenbein, a member of West Germany's 1974 World Cup winning side, quit as commercial manager, ending a relationship with the club which began nearly 30 years ago.</p>
