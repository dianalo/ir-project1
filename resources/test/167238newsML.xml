<p>Yonkers Financial Corp said Tuesday that it will repurchase up to 142,830, or about four percent of shares issued in the company's initial public offering in April 1996, in order to fund its management recognition plan.  </p>
<p>In a release Tuesday, the company said the shares will be repurchased from "time to time depending on market conditions" at prevailing market prices.</p>
<p>A Yonkers Financial executive said in the release that using repurchased stock to fund the management recognition plan will not dilute the stock ownership of shareholders.</p>
