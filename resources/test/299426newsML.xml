<text>
<p>Soymeal basis levels were mostly steady on Friday in quiet conditions with crushers preoccupied with buying soybeans following a sharp run-up in CBOT futures prices, soymeal dealers said.</p>
<p>"I'm buying a lot of soybeans this morning but it is not too easy to sell the product $10.00 up," one Indiana-based crusher source said.</p>
<p>CBOT soybeans and meal touched their respectively 30 cents a bushel and $10.00 per ton limits in key months Friday following bullish U.S. stocks and production data issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>Cash sources also noted crushings continued at a fast pace with weekly data issued by the National Oilseed Processors Association showing only a marginal decline to 30.48 million bushels, down from 30.54 million a week earlier.</p>
<p>Diminishing margins were, however, expected to start slowing crushing operations shortly, they added.  </p>
