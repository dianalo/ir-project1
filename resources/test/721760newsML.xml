<p>NWE oil swaps were steady to a touch firmer on Friday in quiet markets. Crude's consolidation over $18.00 a barrel was supportive, but rumours of a heavy sell-off before the close caused concern, traders said.</p>
<p>Gasoline swaps were $1 firmer, naphtha broadly steady Brent crude CFDs a touch weaker close in but stronger further out.</p>
<p>Brent CFDs had a very quiet day with one of the market's main players noticeably reticient.</p>
<p>July 14-18 was pegged at -18 cents against August Brent from -13 cents while July 21-25 fell one cent to -24/25 cents from -23/24 cents. July 28 to August 1 was a few cents firmer at -26 cents from -28 cents and August 4-8 strengthened to -27 from -29.</p>
<p>July 28-August 1 traded against September Brent in the morning at -25 cents.</p>
<p>Heavy fuel was a touch stronger, reflecting some tightness in the physical market. Activity was, however, fairly dull with July holding around $85-86, August $1 contangoed and September a further $1.25 contangoed. October through to December was showing a steepish spread of $2-2.25.</p>
<p>Gasoline swaps were $1 or so firmer with phsyical tightness resulting from recent arbitrage trade to the United States and lower output at two refineries both important factors.</p>
<p>July was steady, but very slow at $184.50-185 with the gains more clearly shown in August which was up $1 at value $186.00</p>
