<p>German politicians who want to protect the purity of their beer have drafted legislation to prevent the use of genetically altered ingredients by brewers.</p>
<p>A bill from the opposition Social Democrats calls for genetically manipulated barley, hops and yeast to be banned from brews conforming to Germany's famous Purity Law for beers, the journal of the lower house of parliament reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>The pub-loving politicians noted with concern that genetically altered barley and yeast were already available and even manipulated hops could become a reality.</p>
