<p>Israel and the PLO restarted U.S.-brokered talks on Thursday on implementing a long-delayed Israeli troop redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>"Progress has been made but there are still some differences that both sides are trying to overcome," U.S. mediator Dennis Ross told Reuters as negotiators began a session in a Jerusalem hotel likely to run into the early hours of Friday.</p>
<p>"The closer you get, some problems come up that are not anticipated but it's part of the overall process. I feel there is a genuine effort to reach agreement and I am hopeful," he said.</p>
<p>PLO officials said Palestinian negotiators submitted on Wednesday a paper listing all the points of agreement and contention between the two sides in the talks that have staggered on for weeks.</p>
<p>The PLO said the main sticking point was Israel's insistence on "hot pursuit" of Arab guerrillas into what would be Palestinian-controlled areas of Hebron and its objection, on security grounds, to the reopening of a road in the town centre.</p>
<p>Israel handed over other West Bank towns to Palestinian rule under a 1995 peace deal but delayed a pullback from Hebron, home to 400 Jewish settlers and 100,000 Arabs, after a spree of suicide bombings in February and March.</p>
<p>Palestinians view a partial pullback from Hebron as a litmus test of right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's pledge to pursue peace efforts begun by the former centre-left Israeli government.</p>
<p>Netanyahu opposes the former administration's policy of returning occupied Arab land for peace.</p>
<p>Near Tel Aviv, police shot and wounded a Palestinian, saying he fled a security checkpoint set up to prevent anti-Israeli attacks to mark an Islamic leader's assassination.</p>
<p>When police at the Morasha junction discovered that the man, one of five Palestinian workers in a van, had forged identity papers, he fled for a field and refused their order to stop, they said. Police shot and seriously wounded him.</p>
<p>Israel was on high security alert ahead of the October 26 anniversary of the killing of Fathi Shqaqi, leader of the militant Islamic Jihad group behind suicide attacks in Israel.</p>
<p>Shqaqi was gunned down in Malta last year in what Palestinians believe was an attack by Israel's Mossad secret service. The militant group vowed to avenge his murder.</p>
<p>Israel set up roadblocks to enforce a closure imposed on the West Bank and Gaza Strip for fear of suicide attacks. Palestinians assail the closure as a collective punishment denying their workers jobs in the Jewish state.</p>
