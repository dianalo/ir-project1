<p>HBO &amp; Co said on Wednesday it expects 1996 revenues to come in at about $790 million, up from about $600 million in 1995 after restatement for three acquisitions this year.</p>
<p>HBO chief financial officer Jay Gilbertson also said the company expects 1997 revenues to top $1 billion after anticipated acquisitions.</p>
<p>"We have about $750 million in acquisition revenue working. We think we can close 10 percent of that next year, conservatively. That takes us well into the $1 billion range," Gilbertson said in an interview with Reuters.  </p>
<p>Speaking after remarks at a Robinson-Humphrey investors conference here, Gilbertson said HBO is comfortable with a range of analysts' 1996 earnings estimates of $1.15 to $1.16 per share. As restated for acquisitions, the largest U.S. healthcare information management concern reported 1995 earnings of $0.74 per share.</p>
<p>Gilbertson also said Atlanta-based HBO supports the high end of analysts' 1997 earnings estimates ranging from $1.55 to $1.60 per share.</p>
<p>"We feel comfortable at the higher end of that range," he said.</p>
<p>Gilbertson added that HBO's recently acquired CyCare Systems unit is expected to generate revenues of $75 million this year and $120 million next year.</p>
<p>"It probably adds $0.05 to $0.07 next year" to HBO's earnings per share, he said.</p>
