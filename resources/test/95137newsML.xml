<p>Lord Sterling, chairman of Britain's P&amp;O, said on Thursday he believed the British government had already made clear that it would not object to P&amp;O's plan for a ferry joint venture with Stena Line AB to compete with Eurotunnel's channel tunnel.</p>
<p>Refering to the government's decision earlier this year to lift specific bans on P&amp;O Ferries cooperating with its rivals on the English Channel, Sterling told an analysts' meeting in London that the political attitude "has already been set".</p>
<p>"There is no way (the British) would hold it up...they said there must be strong competition with the tunnel".  </p>
<p>Sterling said that he hoped the planned joint venture, which would be 60 percent owned by P&amp;O and 40 percent by Stena, would change the competitive balance despite being much smaller in financial terms -- he described P&amp;O Stena Line as a David to Eurotunnel's Goliath.</p>
<p>"There is no point in (ferries) fighting each other, what's important is to have a major competitor up against the tunnel in the years to come," he said.</p>
<p>Though he recognised that regulators would be focusing on the possible anti-competitve effect of the link, Sterling said he saw the situation as being beneficial for customers.</p>
<p>"The alternative for the consumer is you get an emasculated competitor that's on its back foot all the time... that can't be in the interests of the consumer," he said.</p>
<p>Looking at the likely issues to be addressed by regulators, Sterling added that the success in market terms of the Eurotunnel could not be ignored, saying, "The tunnel is a very dominant factor indeed."</p>
<p>The firms declined to detail the impact on profits or jobs of their outline merger plan but a P&amp;O spokesman said it was likely that the crews on the two large ferries due to be taken out of service by the end of this year would be made redundant.</p>
