<p>Two United Nations human rights investigators have delayed a visit to Nigeria because authorities have refused to give them full access to prisoners, U.N. sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>Param Cumaraswamy, special rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers, and Bacre Waly Ndiaye, special rapporteur on extrajudicial or arbitrary executions, were due in Lagos at the weekend for a 10-day trip at the invitation of the government.</p>
<p>The investigators expected full access to detainees and dissidents, which the Nigerian authorities have refused, U.N. sources said.</p>
<p>The envoys were hoping to visit 19 jailed Ogoni leaders who were close to the executed writer Ken Saro-Wiwa and also face the death penalty, and Moshood Abiola, the presidential claimant who has been jailed on charges of treason since June 1994 after a previous army government annulled a 1993 presidential poll.</p>
<p>U.N. sources said an official of the U.N. human rights centre in Geneva was in Nigeria negotiating with the authorities to clarify the terms of reference for the visit.</p>
<p>Nigeria drew worldwide outrage in November 1995 when it hanged Saro-Wiwa and eight Ogoni minority rights activists after their conviction in the 1994 murder of four pro-government tribal chiefs.</p>
<p>Their trial was judged unfair by international judicial experts, and the defendants had no right to appeal. They had been campaigning for compensation for Ogoniland in south-eastern Nigeria for oil extracted there by multinational corporations.</p>
<p>The 19 Ogoni leaders, said to be detained in poor conditions and in deteriorating health, were followers of Saro-Wiwa and belonged to the Movement to Save the Ogoni People.</p>
<p>Nigeria will be one of the countries in the dock when the main U.N. human rights forum opens its annual six-week meeting in Geneva on March 10, according to U.N. sources.</p>
