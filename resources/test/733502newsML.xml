<p>French luxury goods company LVMH is asking too much for its proposed inclusion in a planned merger between Guinness Plc and Grand Metropolitan Plc, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Our belief is that he (Bernard Arnault) is asking far too much here. The structure of the deal as he has proposed it should allow him no more than 27 percent in the combined drinks company on our calculations," said Mark Puleikis, an analyst at Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Bernard Arnault, the flamboyant chairman of LVMH, has opposed the 24 billion pound ($40.2 billion) merger scheme since it was announced in May, arguing that a three way tie up of their drinks businesses would add more value for shareholders.</p>
<p>Arnault sent a plan to both companies earlier today which envisaged creating a separate drinks company, to be listed in Paris and London, boasting proforma sales of 7.4 billion stg for the year 1995/1996 with 19 of the 100 best known wines and spirits brands in the world.</p>
<p>Under his scheme LVMH would have a stake of some 35 percent in the new grouping, in exchange for its 66 percent stake in Moet Hennessy and its holdings in Guinness and GrandMet.</p>
<p>Analysts calculate that the 66 percent stake in Moet Hennessy owned by LVMH and its 14.2 percent stake in Guinness and 6.4 percent holding in GrandMet are worth about five billion stg.</p>
<p>The combined value of Guinness's spirits arm, United Distillers and GrandMet's equivalent IDV is some 12.4 billion. Moet Hennessy is valued at 3.8 billion stg giving a value for the entire drinks group of 16.2 billion.</p>
<p>On that basis Arnault might be entitled to a 30 percent stake in the business, said analysts.</p>
<p>"The extra cost savings of merging Moet with GMG Brands would be an extra 50 to 60 million pounds a year, but then Arnault would take 35 percent of the income stream from the business," said Puleikis</p>
<p>"He is asking too much, because if you look at the valuations involved, 35 percent is unacceptable," said Charles Winston an analyst at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>LVMH argues that including Moet Hennessy in the drinks group would produce added cost savings by a closer integration of existing joint ventures operated in several countries by Moet Hennessy and Guinness owned United Distillers.</p>
<p>It would also benefit from the inclusion of a wider range of brands in cognac and champagne and greater geographical reach especially in Asia, said LVMH.</p>
<p>The company also argues that by creating separately listed companies for food, fast food and brewing its proposal will add greater value for shareholders.</p>
<p>Some analysts agree there are cases where separately listed, single product companies, like Coca-Cola for instance, benefit from a clearer focus amongst management and often a takeover bid premium.</p>
<p>"The market would like purer companies, partly because of the focus and the bid premium attacthed but in many cases its not practical," said Russell Duckworth, an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</p>
<p>"They set us a task to come up with a proposal which would deliver additional value. This we have now done," said a spokesman for LVMH in London.</p>
<p>Guinness and GrandMet said they would reply to the proposal later today.</p>
