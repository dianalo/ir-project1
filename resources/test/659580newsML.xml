<p>Tenants of a Bronx apartment building who link asthma-related problems to their landlord's alleged failure to rid their homes of cockroaches may file a class action lawsuit, their lawyer said on Friday.</p>
<p>Jayson Lutzky said he would pursue litigation against owners of the building "if there are enough complaints."</p>
<p>Residents of 264 East 199th Street were spurred to action by their former neighbour, Carmen Marty, 30, who filed a lawsuit Monday at Bronx Supreme Court on behalf of her two sons, Jonathon, 8, and Steven, 5. She is seeking $22 million for "painful personal injuries" and "emotional trauma" caused by frequent, severe asthma attacks that she said were triggered by the swarms of bugs roaming their previous home.</p>
<p>Last month, a study in the New England Journal of Medicine linked the rates of U.S. inner-city children with asthma to high levels of cockroach allergens. Marty's lawsuit was the first filed in New York based on this data, Lutzky said.</p>
<p>Marty, who said her sons' asthma improved when the family moved to a new apartment, told Lutzky that despite frequent complaints the 199th Street building owners, HKH Enterprises and Norwax Associates, had sent an exterminator to the building only twice in 10 years.</p>
<p>The companies were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Since Monday, several of Marty's former neighbours, including a man who claims he lost part of his lung to asthma, have approached Lutzky about pursuing litigation, he said.</p>
<p>"Landlords are trying to get rid of rent control and raise rents but they don't spend money to fix apartments," Lutzky said. "I hope this sends a message that people have a right to safe apartments."</p>
<p>A few years ago, Lutzky won $20 million for a client who held his landlord accountable for vermin or insect bites on his testicles.</p>
