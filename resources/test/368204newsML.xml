<p>The South Korean won ended Monday's trading lower after drifting against the U.S. unit in the afternoon session, pressured by import settlements and speculative dollar buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>The U.S. unit's rise is expected to continue, fueled by South Korea's huge trade deficit.</p>
<p>The won ended at 868.60 against an opening high of 866.50. It fell to a low of 868.80 early in the day.</p>
<p>"Aside from intervention by the central bank, we believe there are no strong factors to bolster the won from falling still further," a local trader said.  </p>
<p>"Contrary to most expectations, the central bank did not intervene when the won had reached 868, allowing an additional 0.60 fall (in the won) by market closing," said a local dealer.</p>
<p>Traders predicted the dollar/won would range between 868-870.</p>
<p>Tuesday's base mid-rate is expected to be pegged at 867.80, unchanged from Monday.</p>
