<p>Around 800 kilogrammes of chemicals flowed into the Rhine river on Thursday after a breakdown at the German chemical group BASF AG's plant at Ludwigshafen, the company said on Friday.</p>
<p>A semi-finished product in the production of conditioner leaked into the plant's industrial waste system through a faulty connection in a metal pipe, BASF said.</p>
<p>The group said it was able to stop some of the product escaping, but the rest of the material leaked into the plant's sewage plant. From there around 800 kilogrammes of the chemical flowed into the Rhine over Thursday evening and Thursday night.</p>
<p>BASF described the chemical as mildly water-threatening and easily biodegradable</p>
