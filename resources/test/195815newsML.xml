<p>Investors enthusiastically welcomed Europe's biggest share flotation on Monday, competing furiously to pay a substantial premium to secure Deutsche Telekom shares.</p>
<p>The 20 billion mark ($13.3 billion) issue failed to ignite the overall German stock market, however, because it seized the lion's share of investor interest</p>
<p>Among Europe's other major bourses, Paris also sagged as market players took profits after last week's gains. The London market eked out a small rise, but Wall Street was down 13 points by the time Europe closed.</p>
<p>The dollar slipped off its highs in late European trade, dropping to around 1.50 marks after reports that German Bundesbank council member Ernst Welteke said he saw no reason for the U.S. currency to rise.</p>
<p>The huge flotation of Deutsche Telekom, Europe's biggest telecommunications company, gripped investors on both sides of the Atlantic, however.</p>
<p>Nearly 38 million Telekom shares had changed hands by the time the German market ended floor trade . The stock began trading at a 16.5 percent premium and then surged to close just off its 34.10 mark high at 33.90.</p>
<p>It slipped to around 32.55 marks in later screen-based trade in Germany, but remained well above the 28.50 marks the issue was priced at on Sunday.</p>
<p>"There's only one subject today and that's Telekom. Don't go looking for much action elsewhere in the market," said one Frankfurt trader.</p>
<p>The company also made a splashy Wall Street debut, opening at 22-1/8, up 3-15/64 as investors swarmed to buy the stock. It later edged back to around $21.50.</p>
<p>The company, which opens in Tokyo on Tuesday, was runaway volume leader in New York with 5.7 million shares traded less than 20 minutes after it opened on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom earlier painted Frankfurt pink to mark the climax of its long-awaited share issue, blazoning chandeliers, baseball caps and even the walls of the Frankfurt stock exchange with its corporate colour.</p>
<p>Despite the enthusiasm, however, Germany's 30-share DAX index ended 31 points, or 1.14 percent down, at 2,763.84. In later computerised trade, the IBIS DAX was at 2,776.27.</p>
<p>The London stock market ended a lacklustre session only marginally higher as scepticism about Wall Street's ability to sustain its record-breaking run and worries about next week's Budget nibbled at investor confidence.</p>
<p>Traders said bid speculation swirling around British Gas and favourable government borrowing figures should have set the stage for healthy gains, but the FTSE 100 index managed to eke out only a 3.9 point gain to close at 3,962.1.</p>
<p>"We're all hanging around to see if Wall Street will drop out of the sky and the feeling is, one morning we'll see the bears vindicated," one dealer said.</p>
<p>French stocks fell on profit-taking following the bourse's 1.6 percent rise last week, but traders said sentiment remained positive and the market should resume its advance after a brief pause.</p>
<p>The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed down 11.52 points, or 0.51 percent, at 2,228.81, while the CAC-40 November futures contract fell 11 points to 2,231.</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at session lows against the mark in late European trade following Welteke remarks.</p>
<p>Although he said German exporters favoured a stronger dollar, dealers said his comments were giving the market an excuse to liquidate long dollar positions accumulated over the last week.</p>
<p>The dollar lost almost half a pfennig against the mark after his remarks but recovered above 1.50 marks after dipping to a session low of 1.4990.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1710 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 111.32 yen and 1.5012 marks, compared with 111.12 yen and 1.5076 marks in late European trade on Friday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS -- CLOSING INDICES</p>
<p>LONDON - The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares closed up 3.9 points at 3,962.1.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 share index closed down 11.52 points at 2,228.81.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The 30-share DAX index closed floor trade down 31.96 points at 2,763.84. In later screen-based trade the IBIS DAX index was at 2,776.22.</p>
