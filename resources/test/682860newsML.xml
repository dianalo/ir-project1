<p>Brazilian stocks opened firmer Tuesday as the bolsa awaited a rebound in New York following Tokyo's move to calm markets shaken by comments from Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, brokers said.</p>
<p>"We thought it might tick upwards waiting for New York to open," said John Carioba of Indusval brokerage. "Locally, there's nothing going on."</p>
<p>Sao Paulo's Bovespa index of 48 top shares opened at 12,347, 0.88 percent above Monday's close of 12,239 points on trade totalling 786 million reais ($731 million).  </p>
<p>Brokers said local shares Monday closed up, shrugging off a drop on Wall Street after comments by Hashimoto created fears Japan culd begin disposing of U.S. government bonds to boost its gold reserves.</p>
<p>Later, the Japanese Finance Ministry has acted to defuse the impact of those comments, saying they were misreported.</p>
<p>Dealers said Brazilian issues in New York, especially Telebras' ADR, were poised for a rebound along with U.S. stocks and were likely to pull local shares higher.</p>
<p>A lack of local news means investors' eyes will be on New York, Casrioba said.  </p>
<p>"Here, there is no news," he added. "Congress is in half-recess."</p>
<p>Lawmakers from northeastern and northern states were expected to take part of the week off in observance of Tuesday's holiday of St. John, or Sao Joao as he is known in Brazil.</p>
<p>Benchmark blue chip Telebras preferred had already moved 1.41 percent higher trading at 158.50 reais by 10 minutes after the opening bell.  </p>
<p>Despite weeks of rises, dealers said they did not profit-taking to hit local stocks until later this week as investors continue buying to adjust portfolio ahead of the month's close.</p>
