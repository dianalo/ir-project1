<p>The New Zealand government said on Thursday it posted a NZ$2.683 billion operating budget surplus for the 11 months to May 31, 1997, against a revised forecast surplus of $2.738 billion.</p>
<p>The government said one of a primary factors responsible for the operating surplus being NZ$55 million below forecast was taxation revenue that was NZ$107 million, or 0.4 percent, below forecast. Expenses were $39 million (0.1 percent) lower than forecast.</p>
<p>Net public debt was $25.31 billion, which was $153 million (0.6 percent) lower than forecast, and $3.33 billion (11.6 percent) lower than net public debt at June 30, 1996.</p>
<p>The improvement in net public debt over forecast was principally due to lower-than-forecast cash disbursed to operations.</p>
<p>Net public debt as a percentage of GDP was 26.8 percent at May 31 against a forecast 27.0 percent.</p>
<p>The Crown balance (net worth) at May 31 was $6.275 billion, which was $41 million lower than forecast and $2.931 billion higher than at June 30, 1996.</p>
