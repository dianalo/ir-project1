<p>Miss World pageant organiser Julia Morley once said her beauty contest had "always had its fair share of knockers", meaning critics.</p>
<p>But the ugliness generated by the beauty pageant in first-time host India could outdo anything seen in the event's 45-year history.</p>
<p>Some Indian women are threatening self-immolation if the pageant goes ahead as planned on November 23 in the southern city of Bangalore.</p>
<p>The populist Farmers' Association, whose members have stoned American fast-food restaurants in Bangalore, has threatened to torch the Chinnaswamy cricket ground where the pageant will be held.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the furore threatens to upstage the extravaganza, which will feature 480 dancers and 60 ornately decorated elephants, in addition to the contestants, who arrive in New Delhi on November 4.</p>
<p>Already, fear of offending local sensitivities has forced Miss World organisers to move the swimsuit section of the competition to the Seychelles islands in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan, one of India's top screen stars and a friend of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, is the man responsible for bringing the contest to Bangalore, the political base of current Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>Bachchan said he wanted to stage the pageant in India's "Garden City" in the hopes that the publicity surrounding the contest would help promote the Karnataka state capital. The contest is expected to be viewed by a worldwide television audience of more than two billion people.</p>
<p>But many in Karnataka have been decidedly ungrateful. Pageant opponents have staged marches in which they have burned effigies of Bachchan, known as "Big B" to his fans, and brandished placards depicting the macho superstar in a skimpy woman's bathing suit.</p>
<p>Even chief executives of multinationals operating in Bangalore have chimed in. The have staged a protest against money spent in advance of the pageant, which they claim was used for cosmetic improvements to a city that is in need of a major infrastructure overhaul.</p>
<p>Amitabh Bachchan Corporation (ABCL), which holds the licence to stage this year's contest, has fought off court attempts to block the show.</p>
<p>Ruling in favour of ABCL earlier this month, Bangalore justice S. Rajendra Babu gave the activist group Mahila Jagarna Samiti (Forum to Awaken Women) a lecture on the sensual side of Indian culture.</p>
<p>"Coming as you do from the land where there is worship of the phallus, worship of nude women by tantrics ... where erotic sculpture is part of traditional temple architecture, where Vatsayana wrote on the art of love in the Kamasutra, necessary sense and sensibility regarding culture and decency -- to discern between art and beauty on one hand and obscenity on the other hand -- should always be maintained."</p>
<p>Undeterred, right-wing Hindu nationalist parliamentarian Uma Bharati renewed the threat of violence last week.</p>
<p>"We will give our lives, we will take lives, but we will not allow the show," the Bharatiya Janata Party deputy warned at a rally of more than 500 supporters.</p>
<p>Bangalore's police chief is deploying 1,000 police and a crack team of commandos to ensure the new Miss World is crowned without incident.</p>
