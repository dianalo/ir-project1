<p>U.S. Defence Secretary William Perry rejected on Thursday a French demand that the military command of the southern region in Europe be held by a European and not by an American.</p>
<p>Perry said the United States favoured reorganising NATO's military command structure to give Europeans a higher profile following a French decision to enter a revamped military structure of the alliance.</p>
<p>But he insisted that a U.S. commander remain in charge of the southern NATO forces based in Naples, Italy.</p>
<p>French Defence Minister Charles Millon threatened on Wednesday to abandon plans for a full return to NATO unless a European replaced the traditional U.S. command.</p>
<p>General Charles de Gaulle pulled France out of the alliance's military wing in 1966 in protest at U.S. domination, but President Jacques Chirac has since taken steps back to full participation.</p>
<p>"It is quite clear we have a different view on that issue," Perry said, referring to the question of southern region command.</p>
<p>"The United States believes that it is essential that NATO's AFSOUTH (Allied Forces South) command, which includes the U.S. Sixth Fleet and other forces in the Mediterranean, remain under U.S. command.</p>
<p>"It really makes supreme military sense for an American commander to be in charge," he told a news conference on the second and last day of a NATO defence ministers' meeting in Bergen, Norway.</p>
<p>"I might point out that some of those units, for example the Sixth Fleet, besides serving NATO also perform other functions for example in the Middle East," Perry said.</p>
<p>France, noting that Washington holds the top two posts, says the senior command post in the southern and northern European commands should be rotated among the European allies to make the European identity in the 16-nation Atlantic Alliance a reality.</p>
<p>Millon told reporters France considered the issue of "fundamental importance" and could put on hold its reentry into NATO's military wing.</p>
<p>Unless resolved, the new row could also derail attempts to overhaul NATO's command structures and the plans to take in new members from eastern and central Europe.</p>
<p>France is being backed by Germany, Italy and Spain in its insistence for the command to be rotated among European but a majority of NATO countries, including Britain, support the American line, U.S. sources said.</p>
