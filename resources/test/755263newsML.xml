<p>Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered revoked the VIP status of Palestinian police chief Ghazi al-Jabali, suspected by Israel of ties to guerrilla cells within the PLO-led force, an official said.</p>
<p>The status, conferred on senior Palestinian self-rule officials, affords its bearers enhanced freedom of travel in crossing into and through Israel and other privileges the Jewish state denies most Palestinians of the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>Asked to confirm a television report on the revocation, Netanyahu's media adviser David Bar-Illan told Reuters late on Wednesday: "The prime minister has issued the instruction to revoke his VIP status."</p>
<p>Bar-Illan said he did not know if the order had been put into effect.</p>
<p>Israel has made progress in stalled peace talks conditional on Yasser Arafat's Palestinian self-rule Authority (PA) cracking down on suspected guerrillas in its security ranks.</p>
<p>Israeli forces have arrested four Palestinian policemen Israel alleges were involved in planning attacks against Jewish settlers.</p>
<p>For their part, Palestinian security officials have arrested a senior PLO police officer in the West Bank, but Israel has demanded they take further "real action" to root out "terrorist organisations outside of the authority of the PA and inside it".</p>
<p>Without singling out Jabali by name, Netanyhahu has left little doubt Israel regarded the police commander with suspicion.</p>
<p>"Imagine what would have happened if there was evidence or concrete signs that the chief of Israel's police had sent policemen or soldiers to murder Palestinian children," Netanyahu told reporters on Sunday. "There would have been a worldwide outcry.</p>
<p>Israel arrested three PLO police officers last week, saying they were on their way to shoot up Har Bracha, a Jewish settlement near the Palestinian-ruled West Bank town of Nablus.</p>
<p>They arrested a fourth police officer on suspicion of planning attacks near the West Bank town of Nablus.</p>
<p>Palestinians have demanded Israel turn the detained police over to them for interrogation.</p>
