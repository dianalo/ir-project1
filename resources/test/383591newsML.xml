<p>Canadian Finance Minister Paul Martin on Tuesday said Canada's debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio was poised to drop in fiscal 1997/98, setting the stage for a permanent declining trend for the first time in over 20 years.</p>
<p>In his 1997/98 (April-March) budget, Martin predicted that the debt-to-GDP ratio would drop to 73.1 percent in the new fiscal year and 71.2 percent in 1998/99 from 74.4 in 1996/97.</p>
<p>"As a result, our economy will soon be growing faster than our debt," Martin said in his budget speech to Parliament. "The debt will become more manageable. More and more of each revenue dollar will go to pay for services that Canadians need, rather than to pay bond holders."</p>
<p>But the finance minister noted that Canada's debt burden is still very high and a series of operating budget surpluses would be needed to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to more manageable levels.</p>
<p>Canada has the second highest debt-to-GDP ratio among G7 countries. Italy has the highest.</p>
