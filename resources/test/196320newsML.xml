<p>With municipal elections over, Brasilia's halls of power are likely to echo to the muffled sounds of political horse-trading and ministerial musical chairs as the government presses on with its reforms, analysts said.</p>
<p>A constitutional amendment allowing President Fernando Henrique Cardoso's re-election is expected to top the agenda, but government leaders say reforms of the civil service, tax system and social security will not be neglected.  </p>
<p>"The government will be keen to show it's not just interested in (re-election) and will want to flex some muscle. The negotiations for votes have already begun," said political analyst Ricardo Pedreira of Santafe consultants.</p>
<p>The main ace up Cardoso's sleeve is an array of ministries and official positions he can barter in exchange for support.</p>
<p>They include the ministries of transport and health, possibly the ministry of justice if Nelson Jobim switches as expected to the Supreme Federal Tribunal, and the presidencies of the Senate and the Chamber, both up for grabs in February.  </p>
<p>"The government will get the votes it needs through a ministerial reshuffle," Pedreira said.</p>
<p>On the re-election front, a victory in Sao Paulo's municipal vote for the candidate of arch-Cardoso rival Paulo Maluf will hamper the government's work, but warnings that Maluf had emerged a formidable foe were "exaggerated", the analysts said.</p>
<p>Celso Pitta, of Maluf's right-wing Brazilian Progressive Party (PPB), easily defeated former Workers Party (PT) mayor Luiza Erundina by 57.4 percent to 34.7 percent in Sao Paulo.  </p>
<p>Santafe consultants puts support for re-election in the lower house at only 200 votes of the 308 needed.</p>
<p>But political scientist Murillo Aragao was more optimistic.</p>
<p>"It will be difficult but not impossible," Aragao said. "I don't think Maluf has the strength to impede a vote in favour of re-election."</p>
<p>"Maluf's worth is being exaggerated," echoed Carlos Setti of political consultants Walder Degois. "Maluf is strong. But his power is nowhere near as strong as he thinks it is and his party is divided (on re-election)."  </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the government's chief whip in the lower house, Benito Gama, said this week was likely to be quiet in Congress, with efforts concentrated on analyzing Friday's municipal vote and scheduling the agenda for the next months.</p>
<p>She said the re-election issue would not get in the way of a lower house committee vote on the civil service reforms and discussion of bills regulating the opening up of the petroleum and telecommunications sectors.</p>
<p>Progress in the Senate on a social security reform bill is expected to take longer.</p>
<p>"It's a complex game today," said Setti. "Everything is interrelated -- re-election, the fiscal reforms, a re-arrangement of ministerial portfolios and the presidencies of the Senate and Chamber."</p>
<p>He added, "We believe that all of these issues will be resolved by February or March. Once it becomes clear that re-election will get a favourable vote, the government will have improved its chances of getting what it wants from Congress."</p>
