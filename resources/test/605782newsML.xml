<p>U.S. Agriculture Department said Thursday the strong showing by Kansas in the latest Conservation Reserve Program enrollment was due to the high environmental quality of the acres offered.</p>
<p>"The environmental quality of the bids in that state were much higher than the quality of the bids in other states," USDA official Parks Shackleford told a briefing.</p>
<p>Shackleford said for example, comparing Kansas with Texas, producers in Kansas had either planted higher quality cover crops to protect wildlife or were willing to, whereas producers in Texas "as a trend were not as willing to do that."</p>
<p>"That's something where for the next signup we can work with those producers, they can do things to increase the quality of that bid and increase the chances it will be accepted," he said.</p>
<p>USDA announced it had accepted 16.1 million acres in the nation's largest long-term land-idling program, and would hold a second sign-up this autumn.</p>
<p>In Kansas, 1,943,499 CRP acres expire this fall and 1,646,688 acres were accepted in the latest signup. In Texas, 2,798,524 CRP acres expire this fall and 1,779,488 acres were accepted in the latest enrollment unveiled by USDA Thursday.</p>
