<p>Sudan has put its main prison up for sale because of overcrowding, a newspaper said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The privately owned al-Rai al-Akher said the Ministries of Finance and Internal Affairs were discussing the value of the prison in Khartoum's twin city Ombdurman.</p>
<p>The paper said there were 1,200 inmates and the prison could not handle the increasing numbers.</p>
<p>"This affects the health and environment in the prison and the surrounding area," it quoted the director of the prison force, Major General al-Shaikh al-Rayah al-Shaikh, as saying.</p>
<p>A recent visit by officials to the prison led to plans to move it to al-Hadi town west of Omdurman, he said.</p>
