<p>The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) said it would not hold a tender for short-term securities repurchase or reverse repurchase on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The banking sector is below the minimum reserve required level and the interbank interest rates have been reacting to our activity by an increase, thus we will not hold a tender today," Peter Andresic, head of the Open Market Operation Department, told Reuters.</p>
<p>According to official NBS figures, the banking sector is short of liquidity, with banks' minimum reserve demands fulfilled at 94.2 percent as of Monday, after 94.3 percent the previous day.</p>
<p>Interbank money market rates firmed in early Tuesday activity to about 20.5 percent offer on overnights and 18 percent on six-month terms.</p>
