<p>The UK spot natural gas market was quiet,  thin and largely unchanged on Friday, traders and brokers said, as  players took stock after a busy day on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The market's in the same ranges as at the close of business yesterday,"  said a trader. He added that he had been involved in administration  and not actively trading the market, and several other players appeared  also to be giving less attention than normal to the spot market.</p>
<p>There was some interest in short term gas, with one company reporting  a deal for 500,000 therms on the within day market.</p>
<p>A significant gap has appeared between Bacton and NBP pricing in the  prompt market. The balance of August was traded at each location at  a differential of 0.20 pence a therm, and there were unconfirmed reports  that a similar differential was seen on the day ahead and weekend  markets.</p>
<p>Little trade was then reported further forward. The fourth quarter  1997 was traded at least twice at 13.45 pence a therm, and Q4 98 was  traded at 13.60 pence, the same price as was done on Thursday. There  were unconfirmed reports that the Q4 98 trade was done twice at the  same price.</p>
<p>A seller at St Fergus reported two deals that were done on Thursday  but not generally known about on the market until Friday. These were  for Q4 97 at 12.70 pence a therm (50,000 th/d on a Reasonable Endeavours  basis at St Fergus), and for Q1 98 at 16.50 pence a therm (50,000  th/d, firm, St Fergus).</p>
<p>The IPE was also quiet on Friday. Only 40 lots were done after the  record-breaking run of 960 on Thursday. But in each of the three traded  months on the IPE (October, December and January) the price was stronger,  while OTC prices were little moved across the forward curve.</p>
