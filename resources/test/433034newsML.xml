<title>CAYMAN ISLANDS: Swiss national granted bail in Caymans.</title>

<p>Swiss national Peter Kruger has been granted bail of more than $400,000 while he awaits a hearing on extradition to face charges of filing a fraudulent bankruptcy, Cayman Islands officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Kruger had been held without bail since Feb. 20 when he was re-arrested on an extradition warrant. A date for the extradition hearing will be set on Thursday.</p>
<p>Swiss authorities have sought Kruger's extradition since 1995. He and his wife Barbara were first arrested in February 1996 on another extradition warrant, but won an appeal in August that allowed them to remain in the Caymans, an upscale British Caribbean territory.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy resulted from the collapse of Kruger's real estate empire in Switzerland. A number of Swiss banks reportedly lost millions in the failure.</p>
<p>Swiss authorities claim the Krugers did not mention several properties during their bankruptcy, including a US$2 million beachfront home and two US$1.5 million condominiums in the Caymans, a luxury yacht and various other businesses and assets.</p>
<p>The latest warrant was based on a new extradition law passed in Britain in November 1996. Barbara Kruger, who was not named in the second warrant, was not arrested with her husband.</p>
