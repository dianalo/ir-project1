<p>The return of economic strategist P. Chidambaram as India's finance minister lends stability to India's new minority government, which represents barely one quarter of a deeply split electorate.</p>
<p>But analysts said the re-entry of Chidambaram's regional party would do little to alter the hard fact that Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral remains at the mercy of powerbrokers in his rainbow coalition and of its uneasy ally, the Congress party.</p>
<p>Chidambaram was sworn in as finance minister on Thursday evening, 11 days after Gujral's government assumed power.</p>
<p>The 51-year-old, Harvard-educated liberal had been sidelined by the ouster of Gujral's predecessor, former prime minister H.D. Deve Gowda, and the tentative decision by his Tamil Maanila Congress (TMC) party to boycott the new government.</p>
<p>An angry TMC took the decision after the United Front alliance passed over the regional party's leader, G.K. Moopanar, and named Gujral prime minister.</p>
<p>But the party decided on Tuesday to rejoin the government.</p>
<p>"Chidambaram's return is a very good thing as clearly business does trust him and his pro-business budget will now go through," said Sanjeev Sanyal, an analyst at French bank Societe Generale in Bombay.</p>
<p>Indira Rajaraman of the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy said: "His return is to be welcomed as it represents stability."</p>
<p>Chidambaram's absence from Gujral's initial team had shaken financial markets, which are comfortable with his open-market ideology and had pinned their hopes on parliamentary passage of his 1997/98 (April-March) budget.</p>
<p>The budget, which Chidambaram presented to parliament on February 28, won widespread plaudits and sparked a rally in stock markets that appreciated its proposed tax rate cuts and measures to bolster private investment.</p>
<p>Gujral's allies outside of the government -- the Communist Party of India-Marxist and Congress -- want changes in the budget but are not willing to risk bringing down the prime minister by proposing amendments on the floor of the house.</p>
<p>The Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) does not have the votes to topple Gujral on its own.</p>
<p>Rajaraman said that with Chidambaram's help, the budget, including the tax cuts, would emerge largely unscathed from parliament, although a service tax on road transport that sparked a crippling truck strike last month could be dropped.</p>
<p>But Gujral's honeymoon could be brief given the political and economic realities.</p>
<p>He wasted no time announcing in a television interview on Thursday that he would have to take bold decisions to curtail a mounting oil subsidy bill. The prospect of a rise in domestic oil prices to plug the deficit helped to push down share prices on the Bombay bourse on Friday.</p>
<p>Politically, Gujral remained vulnerable to shifting forces in his 15-party minority alliance, which includes regional parties, communists and centrists. Barely a week in office, a corruption case involving the head of his Janata Dal party had exposed divisions within the coalition.</p>
<p>Congress, which abruptly toppled Deve Gowda by withdrawing vital support on March 30, was already flexing its muscles.</p>
<p>"Till March 30, the BJP, the United Front and others used to set the agenda. But it is the Congress party that has set the agenda after that day," Congress president Sitaram Kesri said on Thursday. "We have got what we wanted."</p>
<p>With the BJP, Congress and several left-wing groups outside the government, the parties in Gurjal's cabinet represent just one quarter of the 545-member lower house of parliament.</p>
<p>"The government is clearly fragile," Sanyal said. "I expect that in the next year or so, the United Front will possibly face another crisis."</p>
<p>Said Rajaraman: "Gujral is not free man. He is hemmed in by so many forces. He is at the helm, but he is constrained."</p>
