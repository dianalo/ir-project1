<p>The Bank of Japan's independence must be protected under any revisions to the laws which govern the central bank, BOJ Governor Yasuo Matsushita told a news conference on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Matsushita said the constant presence of a government representative in the central bank's policy-making board meetings is not in line with the policy of preserving the BOJ's independence.</p>
<p>"We must devise a system where the government's overseeing does not turn into pressure," he said.</p>
<p>A government panel recently recommended in a report a basic outline for reviewing the law which governs the BOJ.</p>
<p>The proposals included one to have a government representative participate in the bank's board meetings if the BOJ and the government agree.</p>
<p>At the moment, the representative always attends the meetings, although the person does not have the right to vote.</p>
<p>Matsushita also said it would be necessary to consider the issue of whether the central bank can decide its own budget.  </p>
<p>Matsushita said he was not in the position to talk about what should and should not be included in the revised law, but said he hopes his views will be reflected in the revision.</p>
<p>The government has said it will submit the reform bill to the next parliamentary session which begins in January.</p>
