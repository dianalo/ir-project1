<headline>Egypt may pass on U.S. wheat after rally - trade.</headline>

<p>Egypt may shun U.S. wheat purchases this week after a sharp rally at the Chicago Board of Trade tacked on $9 per tonne to the purchase price, several U.S. exporters said.</p>
<p>"If they buy, I think they'll buy 400,000 to 600,000 (tonnes)," one exporter said. "I think they'd like to buy 500,000 a month, but personally, unless we get a major crash I don't think they'll buy anything this weekend."</p>
<p>CBOT September wheat futures have rallied about 25 cents a bushel since Monday when Egypt bought 450,000 tonnes of U.S. soft red winter wheat.  </p>
<p>Egypt said it will decide Sunday on a tender to buy 50,000 tonnes of French wheat, but several exporters said Egypt had no intention of buying French wheat, which is priced higher than U.S. supplies.</p>
<p>"From what I hear, the French offers are $148 to $152 (per tonne, CIF) while the U.S. offers are closer to $142," another exporter said. "French wheat is just too expensive."</p>
<p>The tender was for August, September or October shipment.</p>
<p>Egypt's main wheat buyer Samir el-Shakankiri told Reuters on Friday he would not comment on whether he intended to buy U.S. wheat.  </p>
<p>"No comment. I will decide to buy when I want to and announce a tender when I want to. It's none of anybody's business," Shakankiri said Friday.</p>
<p>"We're drastically cheaper than France, but we've rallied $9 a tonne in just the few days since the last time Egypt bought," a third exporter said.</p>
<p>A fourth exporter said Egypt can hold out for about two weeks before securing supplies for September shipment. The exporter noted Egypt's purchase earlier this week was set for shipment this weekend or early next week.</p>
<p>"They've always been pretty patient," the exporter said. "They waited to buy the August until a few days before the shipping period. They can hold out a couple of weeks for the September."</p>
<p>Egypt typically imports about six million tonnes of wheat each year, trade sources said.</p>
