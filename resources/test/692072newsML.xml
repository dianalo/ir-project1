<p>Romania's main privatisation agency said on Friday it would relaunch the sell-off of steel maker Otelinox after four bids for a 51 percent stake failed to meet its minimum selling price.</p>
<p>The State Ownership Fund (FPS), the majority shareholder in Romania's sole stainless steel maker, said it would call a new tender for the plant, based in Tirgoviste, 83 km (51 miles) north-east of Bucharest.</p>
<p>"With all four bids below the ask, we will relaunch the privatisation offer, including through an international advertising campaign," FPS spokesman Stefan Ciochinaru said.</p>
<p>Four Western companies -- Ugine, belonging to France's Usinor Sacilor, Samsung Deutschland GmbH and Italy's Stainless Steel International Spa and Finven Spa -- placed bids for the Otelinox stake in a tender earlier this month.</p>
<p>Otelinox has a share capital of around 141 billion lei in shares with a face value of 25,000 lei each.</p>
<p>"The minimum selling price will be maintained at the new tender," Ciochinaru said, declining to give an ask level.</p>
<p>Brokers' community sources said the FPS's was asking 119,000 lei per share -- or the equivalent of over $45 million for the whole package.</p>
<p>FPS bid selection criteria normally include the size of the stake to be purchased, the price offered for that package, further investment plans and environmental protection targets.</p>
<p>Otelinox had a net profit of 7.5 billion lei last year, up from 4.5 billion lei in 1995, which had reversed a 1994 loss of 4.6 billion lei.</p>
<p>The company now trades on the over-the-counter (OTC) market but a local broker said Otelinox would be suspended from OTC trading next week prior to its move to the Bucharest exchange, where it won approval for its listing.</p>
<p>Intermob brokers, who prepared Otelinox' bourse switch, said the company would start bourse trading early in July. ($=7,027 lei)</p>
