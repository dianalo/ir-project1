<title>USA: NYMEX electric futures seen higher on unit outages.</title>
<headline>NYMEX electric futures seen higher on unit outages.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-10</dateline>

<p>NYMEX electricity futures were expected to open higher Thursday on strong cash market prices due to ongoing generation problems in the West and transmission reduction on the Pacific Intertie.</p>
<p>"Between all the unit outages and that (Pacific Intertie reduction), this thing is unstoppable," a New York futures broker said.</p>
<p>Due to maintenance, capacity on the AC segment of the Pacific Intertie were set to be trimmed by 250 megawatts (MW) to 3,200 MW between 0800 and 1800 PDT today and by 450 MW between 0900 and 1600 on Friday, said Bonneville Power Administration Wednesday.</p>
<p>August Palo Verde (PV) futures are poised to set new life-of-contract highs today based on strength in ACCESS and over-the-counter (OTC) activity.</p>
<p>In OTC business, August PV was quoted at $37.40-37.60 a megawatt hour (MWh) more than a dollar higher than Wednesday's settlement, while August California-Oregon Border (COB) was talked at $23.25-23.75 versus yesterday's close at $23.33.</p>
<p>On ACCESS, August PV finished at a new contract high of $36.50, up 44 cents from Wednesday's settlement and August COB ended at $23.50, up 17 cents from yesterday's close.</p>
<p>If the complex continues this week's rise, August PV is not expected to encounter chart resistance until $38.00 and August COB $24.00, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>The 1,073 MW Diablo Canyon nuclear power unit 2 dropped to 60 percent power overnight from 75 percent to repair its feedwater system for 12 hours.</p>
<p>Power production at the 1,158 MW WNP-2 nuclear power plant in Washington state was boosted to 25 percent of capacity from 15 percent as of early Thursday, with the unit expected to be on line later this week.</p>
<p>The 750 MW unit 5 at the Four Corners coal-fired power plant in New Mexico will be shut Friday for three weeks. The unit needs work to repair a ground, or dead spot in its high pressure generator field.</p>
<p>Four Corners' other 750 MW unit plus a 245 MW unit and two 185 MW units were said to be operating normally.</p>
<p>Restarts of the 1,070 MW unit 2 and 1,080 MW unit 3 at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating (SONG) Station, in San Clemente, Calif., were set for July 15 and July 17.</p>
<p>Cool, wet weather is expected to linger over the Pacific Northwest into the weekend, followed by warmer, drier conditions next week.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, seasonably hot and arid conditions are predicted for most of the Southwest through next week.</p>
