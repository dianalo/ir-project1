<p>The current and past chiefs of Peru's anti-terrorist police, known as DINCOTE, were among hostages being held on Wednesday by Peruvian guerrillas at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, another former DINCOTE head, John Caro, said.</p>
<p>"The information I have is that the former DINCOTE chief, Carlos Dominguez, and the current chief, Maximo Rivera, are inside (the residence)," Caro told reporters.</p>
<p>Also among the hostages, who could number as many as 490, were two Peruvian ministers and at least 15 foreign ambassadors.</p>
<p>DINCOTE sources told Reuters the guerrillas did not recognise all the hostages they held and had sought identification from their captives.</p>
<p>It was not known if the rebels knew they were holding the police officials.</p>
