<p>Spot wholesale electricity prices in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic rose Friday on outlook of warmer weather moving into the region bolstering power demand next week, market sources said.</p>
<p>"The load is expected up slightly," said a Northeast-based trader.</p>
<p>Latest forecasts indicated the Mid-Atlantic would enjoy peak temperatures in the 60s to 70s Fahrenheit Saturday, and the region would experience seasonal to above-normal autumn temperatures all next week.</p>
<p>Some participants attributed today's rise to marketers who were short-covering their October positions in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnect pool.</p>
<p>Transmission contraint was again heard in the Philadelphia control area where a major substation continued to operate at reduced operation after an oil fire two weeks ago.</p>
<p>"People have to schedule around it. They may have to increase generation to move power into that area," another PJM trader said.</p>
<p>Firm, peak PJM electricity for Monday delivery was quoted at $21.50-$22.50 a megawatt hour (MWh), up from Thursday's range of than $20.25-$21.50.</p>
<p>Firm, off-peak power for Monday's light load hours in PJM was notationally assessed at $13.00-$14.00, a wider quote than Thursday's $13.00-$13.50.</p>
<p>For the rest of October, PJM electricity for firm, peak delivery was pegged near $21.25-$22.25, compared with a $21.00 quote on Thursday.</p>
<p>November PJM electricity for firm, peak delivery was assessed at $23.00-$23.35, up from Thursday's $22.60-$22.90. A November deal was heard done at $23.10.</p>
<p>December PJM power with similar delivery conditions was discussed between $28.00-$28.25, up from a Thursday range of $27.65-$27.90. A December transaction reportedly changed hands at $28.10.</p>
<p>January/February 1997 PJM deliveries were pegged at $32.00-$32.25, up from Thursday's $31.75-$32.00 quote. Deals were heard transacted between $31.75 and $32.05.</p>
