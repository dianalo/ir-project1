<p>Vietnam confirmed on Friday it was talking with the U.S. company Oxbow International Power Corp over plans for a roughly $300 million coal-fired power plant in northern Quang Ninh province.</p>
<p>A Government Office official said by telephone that Oxbow had been singled out by the Electricity of Vietnam (EVN) in September for discussions on the country's first build-operate-transfer power project.</p>
<p>Industry sources have said contract negotiations were likely to take several months before a project licence might be granted.</p>
<p>The 300-MW generating plant, which will use low-grade coal from local mines, is expected to go into operation by 1999 and be transferred back to EVN 20 years later.</p>
