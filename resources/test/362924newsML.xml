<p>Poland supports talks between NATO and Russia as long as they do not lead to any decisions limiting Warsaw's future status in the pact, Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati said on Friday.</p>
<p>Rosati was asked at a news conference to comment on French proposals for a "bigfive" of U.S., Russian, French, German and British leaders to meet in April to establish outlines of a deal on European security that might allow Moscow to accept NATO's enlargement.</p>
<p>He said details of the initiative were not available, but in principle Poland advocated talks between NATO and Russia on their own mutual relations.</p>
<p>However, Poland wanted to be kept fully informed and believed such talks should be transparent, he said.</p>
<p>"These talks should not lead to limiting our status in future membership of NATO, because this status can be decided only by us and member countries of NATO," he said.</p>
<p>"We want a guarantee from our partners that in these talks nothing about us should take place without us," Rosati added.</p>
<p>Warsaw, which shook off Moscow's domination in 1989, is eager to become a full member of NATO as fast as possible and expects to be invited at NATO's Madrid summit in July to start entry negotiations, along with Prague and Budapest.</p>
<p>Poland is concerned that NATO should not dilute or delay this enlargement in the face of Russian protests that the pact's eastward expansion poses a security threat.</p>
<p>In an initial reaction to the French proposal on Thursday, a Polish foreign ministry spokesman called it an unfortunate idea, which could be applauded by opponents of the country's NATO accession plans. REUTER</p>
