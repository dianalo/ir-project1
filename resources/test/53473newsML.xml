<p>The German parliament on Friday approved three key bills in Bonn's austerity drive, which aims to cut 70 billion marks ($46 billion) from public spending next year to help qualify for Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl's centre-right coalition voted en bloc to pass the bills covering pension and health system reforms as well as sick pay cuts and reductions in workers' protection from firing.</p>
<p>The votes, which were cliffhangers because Kohl has only four votes over the absolute majority he needed, overturned objections to the bills lodged by the opposition Social Democrat-controlled upper house of parliament on Thursday.</p>
<p>Bonn's austerity package, called the Programme for More Growth and Jobs and initiated nine months ago, has taken a major step forward.</p>
<p>The health and pension reforms account for about a third of the 70 billion marks cuts Bonn is seeking, most of which are now assured. The cuts in sick pay and protection from firing are aimed at cutting firms' costs and promoting employment.</p>
<p>"This is an important day for Germany. The eyes of the world are on us," Finance Minister Theo Waigel told deputies.</p>
<p>Trade unions and opposition Social Democrats (SPD) angrily pledged to resist the cuts, but only a handful of protesters gathered near the Bonn parliament to show their disapproval.</p>
<p>Whips for Kohl's Christian Democrats and Free Democrat coalition partners frantically checked with all government deputies before the vote. Kohl slapped his thigh in delight when all 341 members in his coalition voted for the bills.</p>
<p>Two ailing government deputies -- Agriculture Minister Jochen Borchert and Michael Glos, parliamentary leader of the Christian Social Union -- turned up for the vote despite having both been operated on earlier in the week.</p>
<p>Some of the tax changes included in the government's overall reform package have yet to be thrashed out with the SPD in the upper house in talks over the 1997 tax bill.  But this will have little impact on the spending cuts figures.</p>
<p>"I appeal to the SPD to give up its refusal to work with us and to give the green light to our tax bill," Waigel said.</p>
<p>Bonn is desperate to get Germany's public deficit back under three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) as required for countries joining the single European currency.</p>
<p>Germany spends around 1,000 billion marks a year -- equivalent to a third of its GDP -- for social purposes including unemployment, health and pensions. Kohl's cuts would lop around two percent off this.</p>
<p>Question marks remain, however, over the government's ability to cut nearly 10 billion marks off unemployment spending next year because joblessness is now forecast to stay close to record post-war levels of four million.</p>
<p>Waigel has pledged to find extra cuts during the passage of next year's budget over the next two months.</p>
<p>The SPD has promised to block Bonn's postponement of a planned rise in child benefits which would save three billion marks next year. This will be dealt with in the tax bill talks.</p>
<p>"The policies of social injustice will merely raise unemployment and public deficits. Resistance will grow," said SPD leader Oskar Lafontaine.</p>
<p>About 240,000 people demonstrated last weekend to protest against the austerity drive but fewer people stood at a trade union protest in Bonn on Friday than crowded into parliament's visitors' gallery to watch the voting.</p>
<p>Kohl is confident that a majority of Germans grudgingly admit his cuts are necessary, something revealed by a leading polling insitute this week.</p>
<p>The Bonn Express newspaper summed up the resigned mood in a headline: "Friday the 13th -- Today the savings hammer hits us." ($1=1.5126 Mark)</p>
