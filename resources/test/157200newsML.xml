<p>Norwegian shares finished lower on Thursday, burdened by a falling shipping index despite bullish trade in the banking sector and in drug company Nycomed.</p>
<p>Nycomed firmed after the company announced a series of measures to cut costs and restructure operations. Nycomed's A share closed nearly seven percent higher at 88.50 crowns.</p>
<p>But the Total share index fell 0.16 percent to 867.88 points. Turnover was a healthy 693 million crowns.</p>
<p>The banking index rose following the release of nine-month profits by three of the country's top four banks, but both the shipping and industry sectors traded in negative territory.</p>
<p>Den norske Bank (DnB), which reported rising net profits, finished 1.44 percent higher at 21.10 crowns on the bourse.</p>
<p>Fokus Bank and Union Bank of Norway (UBN) reported weaker results, but Fokus finished unchanged at 37.20 crowns while UBN's hybride-share primary capital certificates closed 0.28 percent higher at 182 crowns. Christiania Bank also firmed.</p>
<p>Shipping group Bergesen's B share was down 0.7 percent at 138 crowns while industrial conglomerate Norsk Hydro, which has a 20-percent weighting on the Total index, closed 0.7 percent lower at 294 crowns.</p>
