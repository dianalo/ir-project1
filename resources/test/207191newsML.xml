<p>A U.N. official said on Thursday that a planned U.N. conference on aid for war-torn Afghanistan would be shifted to a new venue after Pakistan, the original host, objected to its arch-rival India taking part.</p>
<p>The meeting, organised by the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance to Afghanistan (UNOCHA) in cooperation with the U.N. Development Programme and other non-governmental organisations, had been due to take place on December 2-3 in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar.</p>
<p>"We are exploring every possibility to hold the meeting as scheduled, but in a different location. We'd like to hold it on the same dates, but we may have to delay it by a few days," UNOCHA coordinator Alfredo Witschi-Cestari told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The humanitarian needs of Afghans are too serious and too urgent to be held hostage to politics," he said. "The purpose of the meeting is to discuss a comprehensive strategy for meeting humanitarian needs and rehabilitating the country."</p>
<p>A Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman said earlier that the meeting had been organised without consulting Pakistan and that some delegates had no right to attend such a conference.</p>
<p>He took particular objection to India, which he said did not figure in the list of donors to Afghanistan.</p>
<p>U.N. officials said India was among countries that had responded to U.N. appeals for aid to Afghanistan and had recently contributed $400,000 of medical supplies and tea.</p>
<p>They voiced fears that any controversy over the meeting might diminish the donor response to a planned U.N. appeal for funds for vital programmes such as mine clearance, food aid, water and sanitation, health and repatriation of refugees.</p>
<p>"We have now learnt that the venue of the conference has been shifted to Geneva," the Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>"We also understand that India is still on the list of invitees and we will convey to the UNDP and the United Nations our reservations on India's participation in this conference."</p>
<p>Pakistan, as an important donor for Afghanistan, would attend the meeting despite its objections, he said.</p>
<p>Last month Pakistan boycotted an Iranian-sponsored regional conference on Afghanistan in Tehran because India was invited. Pakistan opposes any Indian role in Afghanistan on the grounds that it does not border Afghanistan and did not oppose Soviet occupation of the country in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Pakistan and India have fought three wars since independence from Britain in 1947, two of them over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, where New Delhi is fighting a Moslem separatist revolt in two-thirds of the region under its control.</p>
