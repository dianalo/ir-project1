<p>The Philippine balance of payments surplus plunged $2 million in the first five months of 1997 compared to a hefty $1.96 billion surplus for the same period last year, official but preliminary statistics showed on Sunday.</p>
<p>Central Bank officials said the massive drop was caused by loan payments and the selling by the Bank of dollars to defend the peso from speculative attacks triggered by spillover effects of the Thai baht.</p>
<p>The statistics released by the Bank showed the Philippines completely missed the payments surplus target of $1.3 billion for the January-to-May 1997 period under a monetary programme agreed on with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>
<p>The Philippines incurred a payments deficit of $368 million for the month of May compared to the $370 million surplus it posted from January to April, the data showed.</p>
<p>Net international reserves as of end-May stood at $10.037 billion compared to $10.035 billion as of the start of this year, according to the statistics.</p>
