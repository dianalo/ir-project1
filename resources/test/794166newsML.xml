<p>- Police said Tuesday they were not sure who would be charged with shooting a Florida man seven times with BB pellet guns -- his children, who pulled the triggers, or their mother, who told them to open fire.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old father, who showed up at a hospital Sunday with five BB wounds in his chest, one in his arm and one in his cheek, was not cooperating with Lake County sheriffs deputies, officials said.</p>
<p>Hospital staff said the man, whose name was withheld to protect the minor children, got into a shoving match with his wife, sheriff's officials said.</p>
<p>The mother ordered their two children, ages six and eight, into the house and told them to shoot their father, using the Red Ryder BB rifles they had been playing with outside, officials said.</p>
<p>The kids riddled Dad with BBs, then Mom told him to get out, which he did, heading straight to the hospital.</p>
<p>A police spokesman said the mother could face charges of child abuse, child neglect or contributing to the delinquency of a minor.</p>
<p>The children were handed over to juvenile authorities, who will decide whether to charge them with battery.</p>
