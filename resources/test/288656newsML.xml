<p>Singer Frank Sinatra, who spent eight days in a hospital last November, was admitted to Cedars-Sinai medical centre on Monday, his publicist said.</p>
<p>Susan Reynolds declined to say why Sinatra, 81, was admitted to the Beverly Hills facility but said he was expected to be released on Tuesday.</p>
<p>She said the famed crooner and movie actor was driven to the hospital in a private car but Sinatra requested no further details be released.</p>
<p>The singer was admitted to Cedars-Sinai in November suffering from a pinched nerve, but stayed there for eight days after developing pneumonia and reportedly suffering a mild heart attack.</p>
<p>In an interview last month his daughter Nancy Sinatra said that when asked what he wanted for Christmas, the singer replied, another Christmas.</p>
