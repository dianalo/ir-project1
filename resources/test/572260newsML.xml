<p>China sold 358,000 automobiles in the first quarter of 1997, up 9.32 percent from the year-ago period, the Market Daily said on Friday.</p>
<p>Sales had peaked in March, when car dealers sold 150,000 units, a year-on-year rise of 15.23 percent, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Production of automobiles rose a year-on-year 6.21 percent in the first three months to hit 370,000 vehicles, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>China's carmakers still had 110,000 cars sitting unsold in storage by the end of March, it said.</p>
<p>"The present stock of automobiles is still a bit high," it quoted an official with the Ministry of Machine-Building Industry as saying.</p>
<p>Production in China's automotive sector has far outstripped demand, saddling the industry with whole lots of cars it cannot sell, analysts say.</p>
<p>About 91 percent of China's vehicle output was concentrated among just 13 firms, the newspaper said. China has more than 300 factories making whole automobiles.</p>
<p>Analysts have said output of China's flagging automobile sector has been far below capacity, with production of sedans running at just 45 percent of capacity.</p>
