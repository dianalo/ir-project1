<p>An opponent of the Kenyan government threatened on Monday to launch a wave of popular uprisings and industrial unrest there if President Daniel arap Moi, facing elections this year, did not agree to step down.</p>
<p>Sheikh Khalid Balala, a radical Moslem preacher who has lived in Germany for the past two years, said he would seek entry visas for several African countries and the United States to contact opposition figures.</p>
<p>"I am in the process of mobilising Kenyans internally and externally not only for a popular uprising but also for striking...But I'm leaving the option open for a peaceful solution," Balala said by telephone in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>Balala was due to attempt to reenter Kenya last weekend ahead of the July 1 deadline to register for the elections but said allies had warned him that his presence there could aggravate an already "politically and socially hot situation".</p>
<p>Kenya's embassy in Germany reiterated Nairobi's stance that it did not view Balala as a Kenyan citizen and would bar him from entering the country as such.</p>
<p>Balala said he planned to travel to Rwanda in the next two days to meet Raila Odinga, one of Kenya's leading opposition politicians.</p>
<p>Balala has threatened to enter the country illegally and wage an armed struggle to bring down Moi's government, which he accuses of being an oppressive regime and likens to that of ousted Zairean president Mobuto Sese Seko.</p>
<p>"We are justified in using any methods to remove Moi...We are ready to pay any price," he said, adding that he and his allies could count on huge backing from the country's disaffected young.</p>
<p>Balala was refused entry to Kenya on June 7 when security officers detained him as he arrived at the coastal resort of Mombasa aboard an airliner from Frankfurt and forced him to return to Germany.</p>
<p>He said his passport had expired while he was in Germany but the Kenyan embassy in Bonn refused to renew it. He said he had German travel documents but remained a Kenyan citizen.</p>
<p>Kenyan immigration officials have said Balala, who has a Kenyan mother and Yemeni father, automatically gave up his Kenyan citizenship when he failed to renounce his Yemeni citizenship at the age of 21.</p>
<p>Vincent Ogutu-Obare, Kenya's ambassador in Germany, said by telephone on Monday that Kenya continued not to recognise Balala as a Kenyan citizen and that there was no question of him returning to the country with a Kenyan passport.</p>
<p>President Moi, aged 73 and in power since 1978, must call elections in 1997 pitting the ruling KANU party against an opposition fractured mainly along ethnic and personal lines.</p>
<p>Opposition politicians including Odinga were due to hold "illegal" rallies this month to press for constitutional reforms before the elections, but last week said they would instead seek a dialogue with the government.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, one person was killed and scores of shops in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi were looted during rioting after security forces broke up an opposition rally.</p>
