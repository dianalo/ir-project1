<p>Kobe rubber futures were mostly firmer in after-hours trade on Tuesday, as individual investors hunted for bargains after prices fell during the day, traders said.</p>
<p>Only the benchmark August was lower than the day's close, which was off 0.2 yen at 151.4 yen. Other prices ranged from 0.6 yen to 2.7 yen firmer. Total trading volume during the day was 12,120 lots, an exchange official said.</p>
<p>"A feeling that prices were too low stimulated buying in the after-hours session. Prices are likely to consolidate at current levels," one trader said.</p>
