<p>British foods group Geest Plc said on Thursday its results in 1997 to date had met its targets and that it was on course to meet its expectations for the full year.</p>
<p>Geest said it had strong positions in the British chilled foods market and that existing businesses were progressing well. It said it planned acquisitions but gave no further details.</p>
<p>"Geest has the capacity and cash resources to develop in areas of the food market which are showing the fastest growth. The results so far for 1997 have met our planned targets," Vaco said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company gave no details of its targets or possible candidates for takeover.</p>
<p>Geest recently bought Belgian chilled meals manufacturer Vaco for 4.6 million stg. It said it would invest another 2.0 million stg to produce a new range of short shelf-life chilled products for Dutch supermarket chain Albert Heijn.</p>
