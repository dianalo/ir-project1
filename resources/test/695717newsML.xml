<headline>Zloty falls half point vs basket, future hazy.</headline>
<text>
<p>1115 GMT - The Polish zloty weakened half a percent against the currency basket by mid-day Monday to 0.72/0.41 pct from the trading band centre vs opening's 1.05/0.97 pct in volatile trade marred by one figure spreads.</p>
<p>* It was at 3.2880/980 to the dollar, down from 3.2720/60 at 0700 GMT and at 1.8835/95 to the mark, down from 1.8807/12.</p>
<p>* Dealers said it was difficult to anticipate future zloty moves as the market was shallow and trade extremely choppy.</p>
<p>* Some said foreigners sold small amounts of Polish paper on Monday, but that much of today's currency buying sentiment was driven by speculation. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700</p>
