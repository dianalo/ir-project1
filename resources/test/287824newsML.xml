<p>MAPCO Inc announced Monday it has bought independent wholesale propane marketer Gas Supply Inc, a deal that will more than double the company's propane market base in the U.S.</p>
<p>MAPCO spokesman Rick Neal said the acquisition last week of the Minnesota-based company will increase MAPCO's wholesale base from 105 million gallons in 1996 to 225 million gallons in 1997.</p>
<p>Gas Supply Inc's market base was focused in the central and northeastern regions of the U.S.</p>
<p>"The Gas Supply Inc acquisition dramatically strengthens MAPCO's presence in the wholesale propane market..." company chief James E. Barnes said in a press release.</p>
<p>"It is a further example of our determination to establish a market-leading position in selected energy markets that have the potential to help double our earnings per share within five years," he added.</p>
<p>The company would not disclose terms of the deal.</p>
<p>MAPCO is a diverse energy group that has one of the largest operators of natural gas liquids and ammonia pipelines in the U.S.</p>
<p>In November, the company bought two retail propane concerns, bolstering its position as the fourth largest retail propane concern in the U.S.</p>
