<p>Telesoft Corp said Monday it expects its results for fiscal 1997 and part of fiscal 1998 to be hurt by product delays.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement that delays in the roll out of its TelMaster, a final version of which will not be released until the fourth quarter of 1997, combined with delays already experienced, will hurt profitablility. TelMaster is the company's new product for the accounting market.</p>
<p>Telesoft reported a second quarter loss of $465,067, or $0.12 a share compared with a profit of $502,376, or $0.13 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenues were $7.1 million compared with $5.8 million a year-ago.</p>
<p>The weak results were affected by a $384,000 pre-tax charge for restructuring of its GoodNet subsidiary, as well as continued operating losses at GoodNet. Results were also hurt by the slow roll out of TelMaster. The company expects additional losses at GoodNet through 1997.</p>
<p>It said that, based on its existing backlog, its Student Telephone Services should post higher comparable quarter sales and operating income in the fourth quarter of 1997 and into fiscal year 1998.</p>
