<p>HOSPODARSKE NOVINY - Marko Stehlik sold 100 percent of his company Bohemia Art, including its share in Poldi Steel, to the Prague holding company ProWin. Representatives of ProWin stated yesterday that a contract had already been signed on February 28.</p>
<p>- The chairmen of the Czech and Slovak National Property Funds, Roman Ceska and Milan Rehak, signed a protocol in Prague yesterday to settle property of the former federal fund. The document allows administrators to immediately sell the remaining shares of 64 federal businesses and so finish their privatisation.</p>
<p>- Trade with military materials in the Czech Republic amounted to $151.5 million last year, which is one quarter less than in 1995.</p>
<p>- Investicni a Postovni Banka decided to change auditors approximately one month before last year's results are to be announced. Its long-time auditor Coopers &amp; Lybrand will be replaced by Ernst &amp; Young.</p>
<p>PRAVO - For mistakes during privatisation of the former Cedok hotels in 1990, the state treasury will pay at least 4.5 billion crowns. The cabinet will decide whether to approve a plan, which, if successful, would prevent this sum from being one billion crowns higher.</p>
<p>- The Senate will begin discussions on the Czech-German Declaration today. President Vaclav Havel will address the Senate.</p>
<p>- Part of the issued shares, which were used in September to increase Agrobanka's basic capital, will be cancelled, and the bank's basic capital will decline nominally by 399 million crowns. This is according to the compulsory administrator of the bank, Jiri Klumpar.</p>
<p>LIDOVE NOVINY - Defence Minister Miloslav Vyborny denied allegations that important NATO documents were misplaced in his ministry. In the Partnership for Peace programme, a total of 730 standards were given to the ministry, of which 595 are at the ministry's disposal.</p>
<p>MLADA FRONTA DNES - The Labour Ministry now has the first draft for the future pension system. If approved, the state will pay part of pension as it does now, but mandatory individual savings should play a progressively larger role. People will also be able to directly influence the amount of money which they will receive during retirement.</p>
<p>- The tender for a strategic partner for Aero Vodochody, the largest domestic munitions plant, from which the cabinet expects multibillion crown investments, is close to being cancelled. A small amount of companies entered the tender, and now there are few to choose from.</p>
