<p>Striking Venezuelan doctors said on Tuesday they would return to work in emergency wards and resume stalled pay talks with the government after walking out of hospitals last Friday.</p>
<p>"Depending on how the talks go will determine how long the truce lasts," Federation of Venezuelan Medics president Fernando Bianco told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Venezuelan government has blamed the striking doctors for six deaths during the strike.</p>
<p>But representatives of Venezuela's 27,000 public doctors, who have asked for a 1,000-percent pay rise, said the government was to blame.</p>
<p>Venezuelan doctors earn an average $126 per month in a public health system notoriously underfunded and poorly supplied.</p>
<p>Over the weekend unattended mothers gave birth in hospital doorways and patients went untreated as overstretched military doctors staffed emergency wards throughout the country.</p>
<p>Doctors had ignored a presidential decree that ordered them back to work on Friday.</p>
<p>"They have taken the Venezuelan poor hostage and are simply decreeing death sentences to those that arrive at emergency wards in a serious condition," Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff said before the doctors agreed to return to work.</p>
<p>"The expectation of a $1,000 minimum salary, however just it might be, is just outside the reach of the Venezuelan economy," he added.</p>
