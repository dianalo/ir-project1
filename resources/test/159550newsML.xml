<title>UK: LIFFE white sugar resumes bearish trend, Dec focus.</title>
<headline>LIFFE white sugar resumes bearish trend, Dec focus.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-01</dateline>

<p>London's spot December white sugar contract took centre stage in solid Friday volume with mixed sellers continuing to pressure nearby values after a lacklustre raws performance failed to inspire an upturn in sentiment.</p>
<p>After a firmer open, commission house buying interest in March and May kept both positions supported and gave the market the prospect of a corrective bounce after the recent sell off.</p>
<p>But with New York's March contract failing to move more than one point higher than its open, the reversal of sentiment went unconfirmed and London prices saw resumed selling pressure.</p>
<p>Trade and commission house players kept the two nearby contracts weighed down, although light buying kept values off the session lows.</p>
<p>The December/March spread was reported to be active, narrowing to $2.00 at one point. "The Dec is coming under a little bit of pressure," said one trader.</p>
<p>"The market's trend is down and it's in a bit of an oversold situation in both London and New York," he said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the December contract ploughed through major chart support at $310 as mixed outright selling gathered pace with the decline in fortunes of the March raws.</p>
<p>Technical analysts have said both nearby positions are oversold and could expect an upward correction at some stage.</p>
<p>At 1641 GMT December was $1.10 lower at $308.00, 50 cents off its intraday low, and March was 50 cents down at $305.00.</p>
<p>Although the market's main open interest has shifted to the second-month March contract, December accounted for the bulk of the overall volume of 2,254 lots.</p>
<p>The Matif white sugar market was closed on Friday due to All Saints Day.</p>
<p>Traders said the market needed to see a stronger move in either direction to encourage decisive action from buyers or sellers, adding that physical offtake was also lacking.</p>
<p>"We're a little bit stuck -- we're seeing a little physical offtake but not enough of it. The offtake will probably come on a bounce," the trader said.</p>
<p>In fundamental news, Iran bought three cargoes of Thai and European Union (EU) origin white sugar for shipment in February. It bought one Thai cargo at $322 per tonne, fob, and two EU cargoes at $318 and $317.</p>
<p>Physical brokers said the purchases were made at relatively low prices and formed part of Iran's regular buying programme at this time of year.</p>
