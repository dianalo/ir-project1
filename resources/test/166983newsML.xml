<p>Spanish government bonds are set to outperform the Italian market as dealers regain confidence in Spain's improved chances of being included at the start of European Economic and Monetary Union, analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They said Italy offers more value short term via lower inflation, greater margin to cut interest rates and the lira's likely re-entry to the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM).</p>
<p>But Spain has a unique and very important advantage -- a smaller public debt burden.</p>
<p>"Italy is a big country and it has a large debt: that could make the (European) Union very unstable," said Henrik Lumholdt chief economist at Bank of America in Madrid.</p>
<p>Usually considered twin countries by foreign investors, Italy and Spain have recently increased competition aiming to attract money from outside and fund public deficits at cheaper rates.</p>
<p>The 10-year spread between Italian bond and Bono yields -- trading today near a 1996 record low of 28 to 30 basis points -- should soon widen again, analysts forecast.</p>
<p>"We think fair value would be around 30 basis points," said Alfredo Urrutia, chief economist at Societe Generale in Madrid.</p>
<p>Bank of America's Lumholdt agreed: "The spread could be squeezed another 10 basis points more to 20 bps, but it will soon widen again towards 50 or even 60."</p>
<p>A Portuguese newspaper said on Tuesday that the European Commission expects all EU countries except Italy and Greece to meet budget deficit targets for the single currency. The EU report is due to be released officially on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It seems Btps have discounted all the good news so we should see the yield spread going back to higher levels." said Robert Huw, bond strategist at Natwest Markets in London.</p>
<p>After surprise preliminary data pointing to a decline in Italian inflation --up 3.0 percent year on year in October versus 3.4 percent in September-- the Bank of Italy aggressively cut its discount rate by 75 basis points to 7.50 on October 23.</p>
<p>"People on the market believe they have room to cut again right after the budget is approved, and also that the lira will be in the ERM again" said Urrutia.</p>
<p>Spanish inflation performance is perhaps a little worse, but neither should its prospects spook the market.</p>
<p>Analysts see Spanish inflation ending 1996 at around 3.4 percent year on year, breaking under 3.0 percent in the first quarter of 1997 and ending 1997 around 2.5 percent from 3.5 percent in September.</p>
<p>At 1550 GMT the 10-year bono future was up 121 basis points at 108.47, while the Liffe Italian contract rose 115 to 124.84.</p>
<p>"Today all bond markets are rising, but I think they are moving on U.S. elections, not on EMU matters," said Lumholdt.</p>
<p>"Until the market rallies, Italy will win. But my feeling is that both Spain and Italy have reached the top," he added.</p>
<p>The risk for bonos is the possibility that both Spain and Italy miss EMU targets. In that case the Italian spread over bonos could dip even further, dealers said.</p>
<p>"If we believe Germany and trust that neither Italy or Spain will make it on time, we should sell Spain and buy Italy until the spread is squeezed to zero," said Alessandro Ceccaroni, a trader at UBS in London.</p>
