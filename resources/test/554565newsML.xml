<title>USA: CME hog and pork belly futures calls range mixed.</title>
<headline>CME hog and pork belly futures calls range mixed.</headline>

<text>
<p>Early calls on CME hog and pork belly futures ranged mixed, from 0.100 cent lower to 0.100 higher, livestock analysts said.</p>
<p>Some analysts said steady to lower cash hog indications, as wet fields keep farmers from fieldwork in some areas and allow them time to sell hogs, were expected to weigh on hog futures.</p>
<p>However, others cited further strength in pork cutout values and averall tight hog supplies. Hog numbers have been well under previous expectations, even with a larger holdback of gilts for breeding, they said.  </p>
<p>Analysts looked for further rolling of long May positions into back months of pork belly futures ahead of first delivery notice day on Monday. Some analysts also cited overhead technical resistance and continued talk that the cash market is actually weaker than is being reported.</p>
<p>However, others said the rolling and continued lighter-than-expected hog slaughter pace will support the market. Also, exports have been active and stored stocks are down much more than had been expected, they added.</p>
