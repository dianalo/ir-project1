<title>ISRAEL: Israeli shares end higher as shekel strengthens.</title>
<headline>Israeli shares end higher as shekel strengthens.</headline>
<dateline>TEL AVIV 1997-07-02</dateline>

<p>Israeli shares rose on Wednesday as the shekel continued rebounding against the dollar, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares ended up 1.44 percent, or 4.18 points, to 294.50 on all-share turnover of 159 million shekels against 151 million shekels on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index closed 1.18 percent higher at 302.25.</p>
<p>"The shekel is stabilising and this is good for the market. Foreign investors are returning to buy. They don't like to buy when the shekel is weakening," said Yoram Ben-Yaeir of Ahrayut Investment Management.</p>
<p>The Israeli shekel rose 1.2 percent against the dollar on Wednesday, bringing the currency's gain to a total of 2.4 percent since Friday. The shekel tumbled five percent in the last week of June.</p>
<p>"There is a clear correlation between the shekel and the stock market. When the shekel lost five percent against the dollar, the market lost 3.4 percent. Now that the shekel has gained 2.4 percent, the market has risen three percent," said Eyal Kolka of Sigma Securities.</p>
<p>Kolka said the market is worried that the steep decline of the shekel will lead to higher inflation and to an interest rate hike. "Many investors believe that the benefits of a shekel depreciation are less than the loss from a rate hike," he said.</p>
<p>"Volume remains moderate and the market has not recovered yet but it appears that in the short run shares will continue to rise," Ben Yaeir said.</p>
<p>Industrial Buildings, the top gainer on the Maof, surged 4.5 percent to 693 agorot on volume of 6.1 million shekels. Traders said the share rose on rumors that a foreign investment bank is interested in buying a big stake in the company.</p>
<p>The most active shares were Bank Leumi, which gained 0.25 percent to 550 agorot on turnover of 13.4 million shekels; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, which fell 2.5 percent to 22,779 on volume of 11.3 million shekels; and Bank Hapoalim, which rose 1.0 percent to 767 agorot on volume of 6.3 million shekels.</p>
<p>($1 = 3.5 shekels)</p>
