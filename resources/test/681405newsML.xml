<p>Polish shares on Monday fell after gaining slightly late last week and analysts saw the market down on Tuesday and flat or down into next month as investors save up to buy copper giant KGHM Polska Miedz SA.</p>
<p>The firm's 1.3-1.7-billion-zloty ($402 million-$525 million) public offering starts on June 30, the day large Bank Handlowy starts trade on the main market, where KGHM opens on July 10.</p>
<p>"(The selling) is likely due to the new issues soaking in a huge amount of money and a lack of new money, so the bourse is not behaving as it should considering the economy is going so well," said Jan Koch of Polish Development Bank (PBR) house.</p>
<p>The main market's all-share WIG index fell 1.2 percent to 15,862.6 points and turnover fell 9.4 percent to 116.5 million zlotys ($40 million) on all three markets. Losers led gainers by 71 to 19 with 16 stocks flat.</p>
<p>Analysts said good economic data which would prevent heavier selling during the KGHM issue included the statistical office's Friday statement the economy should continue to grow fast this quarter after 7.3-percent growth in the first.</p>
<p>Analysts said the National Investment Fund NIF index, down 3.6 percent to 147.2 points, extended recent falls as a result of the ongoing conversion of NFI units and sale of shares after the latter's speculative surge earlier this month.</p>
<p>Mass privatisation NFI shares started bourse trade on June 12. Analysts said both shares and NFI units, down two percent on Monday to 149 zlotys ($46), could rebound during the next few sessions, signalled by their ever decreasing turnovers.</p>
<p>They said trader Universal, down 7.1 percent in moderate trade to 10.5 zlotys ($3.2), was hurt by Saturday's news the shares in its convertible bond issue were priced at 10 zlotys ($3.1).</p>
