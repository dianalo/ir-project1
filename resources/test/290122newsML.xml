<p>Opening the new congressional session, House lawmakers Tuesday introduced several bills and proposed constitutional amendments aimed at requiring the federal budget be balanced.</p>
<p>At the same time, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said the House will vote in February on an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to require the budget be balanced.</p>
<p>Reps. Dan Schaefer, R-Colorado, and Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, and a bipartisan group of sponsors introduced the same balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution that passed the House last year 300-132.  </p>
<p>The balanced budget amendment failed in the Senate last year by one vote, but it gained two supporters as a result of the 1996 election and is expected to pass this year. The vote is expected to be closer in the House since several of its supporters were not returned in the November election.</p>
<p>A constitutional amendment must win two-thirds of the House and Senate to pass and be sent to the states for ratification. It needs passage by 38 states to become law.</p>
<p>House Ways and Means Committee chairman Bill Archer introduced his version of a balanced budget constitutional amendment. Archer's version would require approval by two-thirds of the House for spending above the budget limits rather than the three-fifths vote required in the Schaefer-Stenholm version. He has introduced this measure each year.</p>
<p>Freshman Republican Kay Granger of Texas introduced a bill to require the president to submit a balanced budget each year. If passed, it would have the force of law, but would not change the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>"One resolution must be kept: the commitment by President Clinton and the leaders of Congress to balance the budget by 2002, and keep it balanced," she said.</p>
