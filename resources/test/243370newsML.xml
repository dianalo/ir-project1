<p>THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW</p>
<p>While the big money-spinner for Australian universities is still charging overseas students to come to an Australian campus, most of Australia's 37 universities have now established some form of overseas presence to deliver Australian-credentialled course and several universities, including RMIT, Monash, Sydney and NSW are establishing their own branch campuses in Asia.

<p>The Federal Government has come under further criticism over its sale of telecommunications giant Telstra. The Opposition and Liberal backbenchers claim full privatisation of the company is on the drawing board, but as amendments to the Telstra bill were eing thrashed out in the Senate yesterday, Prime Minister John Howard assured critics the Government would continue to encourage competition in the telecommunications market.

<p>The House of Representatives looks set to pass a vote to override the Northern Territory's euthanasia legislation in what appears to be a decisive majority. Father of the House and former National Party Leader Ian Sinclair called for an amendment to the bll, seeking to put it aside as it was 'discriminatory' against the people of the territories, but the amendment failed 45-82. The Andrews euthanasia bill will go to a Senate inquiry before a Senate vote next year. Page 4.</p>

<p>According to a poll by the Far Eastern Economic Review - one of Asia's top business magazines - more than two-thirds of senior executives in the region say the race debate has made Australia a less attractive place for investment and say they are not satisfied with the Federal Government's handling of the debate over Asian migration.

<p>The United Kingdom and the European Union both backed Australia's push for a new "millennium" round of multilateral trade negotiations before the end of the decade and a forward looking free trade agenda concerning information technology and investment also gained support from other industrialised countries at yesterday's world trade talks in Singapore.

<p>Under a radical proposal unveiled by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation yesterday, the national broadcaster will shed 60 executives - one in five - and merge its radio and television divisions in an effort to cope with an upcoming A$55 million cut toits budget next year.
