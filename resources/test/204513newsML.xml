<title>SWITZERLAND: EU to press request for WTO panel on Helms-Burton.</title>

<p>The European Union will on Wednesday press its request for a World Trade Organisation (WTO) dispute panel on the U.S. Helms-Burton law aimed at reducing foreign investments in Cuba, an EU official said.</p>
<p>The official was speaking before a meeting of the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) at which creation of a panel will be approved automatically as long as the EU maintains its demand.  </p>
<p>"We have seen no change in the U.S. position, so we will be going ahead," the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>U.S. officials indicated that Washington's trade ambassador Booth Gardner would be arguing that the law, signed by President Bill Clinton at the start of his re-election campaign at the start of this year, was currently in suspense and did not have a wide-ranging effect.</p>
<p>The United States is also expected to say that its move against communist-ruled Cuba was taken in its national security interests -- an argument some trade analysts say is covered by an article in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) which underpinned the WTO.</p>
<p>The EU argues that the law, named for its congressional sponsors and widely condemned by nearly all U.S. trade partners, runs counter to a range of WTO rules.</p>
