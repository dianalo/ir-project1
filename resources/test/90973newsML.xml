<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello, under heavy criticism for comments made after a private meeting with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, should not resign, Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said.</p>
<p>"No, absolutely not," Fischer told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio when asked if Costello should resign as the Labor Opposition has demanded. "Peter Costello has the full confidence of the government," Fischer said.  </p>
<p>After a meeting with Greenspan Costello told Australian reporters in Washington that Greenspan was very optimistic and saw no threats to inflation.</p>
<p>Costello also said he did not think there was any expectation of a rise in U.S. interest rates and that Greenspan had said he did not expect a change in the current U.S. scene.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury markets rallied on Tuesday after the comments were reported in The Australian Financial Review newspaper.</p>
<p>Costello said later he did not comment on other countries' policies and that the Financial Review report was "fanciful".  </p>
<p>However a tape recording of his comments later broadcast on radio supported the newspaper's report. The Labor opposition later said the comments showed Costello was unfit for the position of Treasurer and had embarrassed Australia and compromised its relations with U.S. policy-makers.</p>
<p>"How can he ever be trusted again with a confidence by any senior minister or senior bank official after his outrageous breach of faith," Labor Treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Fischer said had not seen Costello's full comments, but financial markets often over-reacted. "The markets have a habit of reacting and over-reacting," Fischer said.</p>
<p>"In no way shape or form should he consider the steps suggested by Gareth Evans," he said.</p>
<p>Costello again repeated his denial about making comments on U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>"I'm not making comments on U.S. interest rates and I'm not quoting them and any suggestion that I would be is wrong," Costello told Australian Broadcating Corp television in Washington.  </p>
<p>When asked if he had made a mistake by divulging comments made in the private meetting, Costello said:</p>
<p>"I'm not giving out any quotes on American interest rates. People can look at published materials and make up their own mind."</p>
