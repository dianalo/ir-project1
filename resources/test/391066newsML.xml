<p>A senior Chinese official in charge of exchanges across the Taiwan Strait said on Thursday that the death of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping would not change China's relations with Taiwan.</p>
<p>"I believe China will not change because of Deng's death and there will not be any change in cross-strait relations either," Wang Xiaomin, deputy director of the exchange bureau of China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said during a cultural visit to Taipei.</p>
<p>"His (Deng's) death is our biggest loss, but I believe he will live in my heart forever," Wang said on Taiwan's state-run television. Wang is a daughter-in-law of China's retired parliament chief and Communist Party politburo member Wan Li.</p>
<p>Deng died in Beijing late on Wednesday at 92.</p>
<p>Deng's reforms and open-door policy in China had formed a strong consensus on the mainland and the current reform pace would not change regardless of who became Deng's successor, the Taiwanese television quoted Wang as saying.</p>
<p>Wang started an eight-day visit to Taiwan on Thursday with 29 other Chinese delegates to promote cultural exchanges between the two sides, rivals since a civil war ended in 1949.</p>
<p>The group includes delegation leader Bayinqolu, a vice president of the All-China Youth Federation and a secretary of the Communist Youth League of China, and Cheng Jinzhong, a director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council.</p>
<p>Only through exchanges between Taiwan and China would they promote understanding between the two sides, Wang said.</p>
<p>Nineteen months ago, China clamped a freeze on what had been slowly warming unofficial ties with Taiwan, which Beijing has seen as a renegade province since 1949.</p>
<p>Both governments in Taipei and Beijing say they want reunification, but under very different terms.</p>
<p>The strained relations were caused by a controversial visit to the United States by Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui in June 1995, a trip interpreted by Beijing as an attempt to promote independence of the island.</p>
<p>Wang's group is scheduled to visit cultural, educational and scientific establishments in Taiwan during their stay, Taiwanese organisers have said.</p>
