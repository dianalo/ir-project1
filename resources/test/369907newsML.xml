<text>
<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Tuesday urged Croatia to exert control over Bosnia's Croats and prevent a recurrence of Monday's attacks on Moslems in the divided city of Mostar.</p>
<p>Kinkel said he had instructed Bonn's ambassador in Zagreb to visit the Croatian government "so that it lives up to its responsibilities in the Dayton Agreement and exerts its influence on those with responsibility in Mostar".</p>
<p>At least one person died and 22 were wounded on Monday when Croats, including policemen, opened fire on a Moslem crowd trying to visit Moslem graves in a cemetery in Mostar.</p>
<p>Kinkel said in a statement the violence was a "slap in the face of those who are striving for peace and reconciliation in a country ravaged by war".</p>
<p>He said "misguided fanatics" should not be allowed to endanger the goal of a town where Serbs, Croats and Moslems could live together in peace.</p>
