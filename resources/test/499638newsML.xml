<p>Fletcher Challenge Forests on Friday confirmed the sale of its 51 percent interest in a Nelson joint venture forest operation to Weyerhaeuser for US$185 million, plus US$5 million of working capital.  </p>
<p>Weyerhaeuser is the world's largest private owner of softwood timber.</p>
<p>"This sale is the third in a series of significant changes consolidating Fletcher Challenge Forests NZ activities on the world class central North Island plantation forest estate," FCL Forests said.</p>
<p>Interests on the east coast of the North Island were sold in December 1996 and areas in the South Auckland region were sold in March 1997.</p>
<p>"Total proceeds from the three sales exceed NZ$500 million," FCL Forests said.  </p>
<p>"This further sale enables us to focus our efforts on getting the best management and cost structures in place in the central North Island."</p>
<p>Most of the New Zealand planted forest estate was now in the hands of respected long term industry owners and all are working towards ensuring New Zealand could compete cost effectively in global markets.</p>
<p>The transaction is due for completion by June 30, 1997, and is conditional on approval from the Overseas Investment Commission. It also requires the approval of the joint venture partner, RII NZ Forests I Inc.  </p>
