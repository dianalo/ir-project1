<p>After years of public clashes with the tobacco industry, President Bill Clinton and the White House are approaching the tobacco settlement with caution -- mindful the battles are far from over.</p>
<p>"The biggest pitfall is that this is not what it's advertised to be," said one senior White House official who has been involved in administration strategy sessions since it became a presidential cause in 1994.</p>
<p>"This isn't the solution, it's only an important step," he said. "There is still a huge amount of work that has to be done."</p>
<p>Tobacco companies agreed on Friday to pay $368.5 billion, admit that tobacco is addictive and accept extensive federal regulation over their products and advertising.</p>
<p>In return, the companies would receive immunity from any further punitive liability for deception, fraud or conspiracy that might have occurred in the past.</p>
<p>In a series of interviews with White House and other administration officials, all stressed that Clinton was delighted with the outlines of the pact with the industry but -- as one official said -- "the devil is in the details, and these guys are devils."</p>
<p>Clinton, in Denver hosting the annual summit of the world's leading industrial powers, quickly announced that he was creating a special task force to study all aspects of the historic agreement and weigh its potential impact.</p>
<p>Officials say the panel, to be chaired jointly by Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and White House Domestic Policy Adviser Bruce Reed, will be given four to six weeks to review the agreement and make recommendations.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of room for mischief here," said one senior administration official. "Much of the agreement depends upon Congress and what it does ... I didn't see any tobacco-state lawmakers in the talks, so who knows."</p>
<p>One official said the selection of Shalala and Reed to head the task force "sends a strong message that all views will be listened to" in reviewing the accord.</p>
<p>Shalala has been an ardent supporter of efforts to impose strict public health standards in any agreement, while Reed advocates what one official described as "a more middle of the road approach."</p>
<p>"The president wants the best advice on this, and that's why he turned to them," one White House official said. "He wants all views considered."</p>
<p>The administration officials said the exact size of the task force was not set and could grow as its deliberations proceded.</p>
<p>The review period also allows "pro" and "anti" smoking forces to marshal their efforts -- something likely to be weighed by the White House as it enters the implementing phase with Congress.</p>
<p>"Look at what happened to the budget deal," one White House staffer noted in discussing the steady stream of bickering that has erupted since Clinton and Republican congressional leaders reached their agreement.</p>
<p>"That could be a piece of cake compared to this," he said, noting the intense and effective lobbying pressure the tobacco industry can create on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>"We just want to make sure there are no hidden loopholes in this" agreement, he said.</p>
<p>When White House strategists sat down in 1994 to discuss a strategy to establish strict federal controls over the tobacco industry, they were sure of one thing -- a long bitter fight.</p>
<p>The announcement Friday of an agreement between the industry and lawyers for 40 states appears to have shaved years and perhaps decades off that fight.</p>
<p>"It's almost easy to forget just how impossible this once seemed," said one White House official who has been involved in the effort.</p>
<p>In August, 1995 Clinton authorized the FDA to regulate how cigarettes are sold and marketed in a bid to curb smoking among children.</p>
<p>The move defied conventional political wisdom, which predicted he would pay a heavy toll during the 1996 presidential campaign. Instead, the move proved popular with voters and pushed the battle further into the political arena.</p>
