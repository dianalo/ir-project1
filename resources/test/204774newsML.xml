<p>Big Japanese companies have probably grown cheerier about business prospects, but the growing corporate optimism is unlikely to persuade the central bank to tighten its easy credit policy any time soon.</p>
<p>Financial markets are jittery ahead of next Wednesday's release of the Bank of Japan's quarterly corporate survey, or "tankan", a vital clue to the central bank's credit policy.</p>
<p>The Bank of Japan has kept interest rates at rock-bottom levels since September 1995, when it slashed its official discount rate to 0.5 percent to keep the economy from diving.</p>
<p>Speculation of stronger-than-expected tankan numbers simmered last week, only to be followed by talk on Tuesday that the survey would show companies were still somewhat gloomy.</p>
<p>Most economists surveyed by Reuters forecast that the diffusion index for big manufacturers, an important gauge of corporate sentiment, would rise modestly, but not to the level predicted by the companies themselves in the last survey.</p>
<p>Their average forecast was about minus three, up from the minus seven seen in August, when the previous survey was done.</p>
<p>Private forecasts ranged from minus 10 to zero. None expected the index to rise into positive territory. If it did so, it would be the first time since November 1991. The firms forecast a November index of zero in an August survey.</p>
<p>The index represents the percentage of firms expecting business to improve minus those who expect it to worsen. The higher the number, the more optimistic the outlook.</p>
<p>A weaker yen, which makes Japan's exports more competitive, strong output data and progress in trimming inventories should have helped lift the corporate gloom in November, they added.</p>
<p>Bank of Japan Governor Yasuo Matsushita told a news conference on Wednesday the recovery seemed to be solidifying but the central bank needed to make sure the improvement could be sustained without reliance on public spending.</p>
<p>"Both the Bank of Japan and the Finance Ministry are getting more bullish (about the economy), but the evidence is anecdotal," one government source said. "It might not show up in data yet."</p>
<p>A few economists, however, expect manufacturers' business sentiment to have stuck at about the same level as in August or even worsened, partly due to worries about the impact of a rise in the sales tax to five percent from three percent next April.</p>
<p>"The economy is almost stalling," said Masaru Takagi, chief economist at Fuji Research Institute, who sees a manufacturers' diffusion index of between minus five and minus seven.</p>
<p>Business circles are concerned about both the consumption tax rise and a falling off in public works spending as Japan's deficit-laden government strives to tighten its fiscal belt.</p>
<p>"It's not 'shock, horror', but I think sentiment might go down," said Chris Calderwood at BZW Securities, adding that other data in the survey would likely show encouraging signs.</p>
<p>Financial markets were jolted in August when the key tankan numbers proved worse than most forecasts.</p>
<p>Sentiment at major non-manufacturers probably also improved a bit from August, when their index was minus four. The average forecast was about minus two, with a range from minus six to zero. The firms had predicted a November index of minus three.</p>
<p>Even the expected improvement in tankan data, however, is unlikely to prod the Bank of Japan to boost interest rates, given concerns about a slowdown and persistent worries about the bad loan burden on smaller financial institutions.</p>
<p>Several economists said credit policy would likely stay on hold at least for the rest of the business year to next March.</p>
<p>"We're still not looking for a change (in monetary policy) until some time next year," said Matthew Poggi, an economist at Lehman Brothers. Lehman had thought the manufacturers' index might turn positive, but on Wednesday said it was likely to range between minus two and zero.</p>
<p>Poggi said: "At the moment, there is no reason to do so (raise rates). Inflation is still zero and...sentiment happens to be a very fragile thing."</p>
