<p>A stunning fall in British manufacturing output in May is a clear indication of the harm the strong pound is inflicting and should not be written off as a monthly blip, economists say.</p>
<p>But the slide in manufacturing activity is still too little and too late to stop Britain's monetary authorities from pushing interest rates higher.</p>
<p>"The manufacturing fall is a warning shot across the bows of the monetary policy committee that there has been a severe tightening inflicted on manufacturing by the strength of the exchange rate," said John Shepperd, chief economist at Yamaichi International.</p>
<p>But he said that may not be enough to stop the Bank of England's committee, now free to change interest rates, from tightening policy at the end of its latest meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p>"It leaves them between a rock and a hard place and whatever they do, someone will tell them that they are wrong. But the betting must be that interest rates still go up but it's not a foregone conclusion that it happens this week," Shepperd said.</p>
<p>Manufacturing output tumbled by 1.1 percent in May, the largest monthly fall since June 1993. The Office for National Statistics said export levels held up and there was little evidence that sterling was having effect.</p>
<p>But most economists disagreed.</p>
<p>"Even though the ONS stated that there was no obvious signs that sterling strength was having an effect, we feel that this is clear evidence," said Neil Parker, economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.</p>
<p>The problem for the Bank of England is that Monday's figures fit the picture, now well established, of a twin-track economy boasting vibrant consumer demand but sluggish manufacturing exports.</p>
<p>"We've got a dual economy and that dichotomy is becoming more pronounced," Shepperd said. "These figures suggest the peak in interest rates won't be as high as some commentators have forecast."</p>
