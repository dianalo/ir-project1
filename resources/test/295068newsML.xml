<p>Indonesia's President Suharto urged farmers on Wednesday to increase corn and soybean production in a bid to curb imports.</p>
<p>"In order to fulfil our corn needs, we have to take special efforts (to raise production). I hope with this, corn imports can be reduced in 1997," he said when giving awards to exemplary farmers at a ceremony in his office.</p>
<p>"We must also increase soybean production. Although soybean output has increased, demand is also growing, so we are forced to import in large amounts," he said.</p>
<p>He said food security was important in Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous country with some 200 million people.</p>
<p>"Food security is one of the main conditions for social, political and economic stability," he said.</p>
<p>A U.S embassy report in November estimated Indonesian corn output in 1996/97 (Oct/Sept) at 6.0 million tonnes, against an estimated 6.2 million tonnes in the previous U.S. marketing year.  </p>
<p>Indonesia has said its soybean production was expected to fall by 100,000 tonnes in 1996 from 1.6 million tonnes in 1995, while imports are seen at around 600,000 tonnes per year.</p>
<p>Suharto said there was also a need to increase efficiency in the country's sugar mills.</p>
<p>"The intensification of sugar cane cultivation has increased production, but we need to increase efficiency of our sugar mills," he said.</p>
<p>The Indonesia Sugar Association had said domestic sugar production could reach 2.55 million tonnes in 1997 from 2.10 million tonnes in 1995.</p>
