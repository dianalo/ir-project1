<p>NOTE - The tyre maker said it was deferring consideration of an interim dividend until after the March 12 budget.</p>
<p>Gentyre said it had been hit by intense local market competition and weak European markets, which impacted on exports. Industrial action at the Port Elizabeth plant in October and November had severely affected production.</p>
<p>But chief executive Johan Bester said the outlook for the remainder of the financial year was better.</p>
