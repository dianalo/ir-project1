<p>Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) is gearing up to raise crude export facilities to at least two million barrels per day (bpd) by 2005, a senior company official said on Monday.</p>
<p>He said the country was also planning to raise its refinery capacity in Asia to 400,000 bpd as part of a wider programme of expansion.</p>
<p>"We are studying adding enough crude oil export facilities to cater for exports of at least two million bpd by the year 2005," Hani Hussain, KPC managing director of marketing, told an oil conference.  </p>
<p>Kuwait, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), now exports just over one million bpd as part of an OPEC quota of two million bpd.</p>
<p>Kuwait's onshore refining capacity is just under 900,000 bpd.</p>
<p>"We are expanding our refinery capacity outside Kuwait with the prime objective of securing an increased market share for Kuwaiti crude oil," he told the conference.</p>
<p>Talks are being held with several Asian countries.  </p>
<p>The most advanced talks are in India where a memorandum of understanding was signed in late 1995 to build a 250,000 bpd refinery at Paradeep on the east coast. It is expected to be on stream by the year 2000, Indian officials said late last year.</p>
<p>KPC said last week it was discussing with China National Petrochemical Corp (Sinopec) a joint venture to own and modernise an existing refinery in China and supply it with crude.</p>
<p>"It is hoped these efforts would lead KPC to establish refining capacity of some 400,000 bpd outside Kuwait in Asia," Hani said.  </p>
<p>Kuwait does not have any refining capacity in Asia. It processes 30,000 bpd of crude in Singapore through Singapore Petroleum Co  SPC.SI.</p>
<p>KPC is also pressing ahead with plans to raise crude production capacity to three million bpd by 2005 and 3.5 million by 2010 from 2.4 million bpd currently.</p>
<p>Hani said KPC was also planning to raise domestic refining capacity to one million bpd.</p>
