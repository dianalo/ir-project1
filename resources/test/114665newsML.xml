<p>Bombay shares resumed a downtrend as support from local funds dried up with most large players remaining on the sidelines, traders said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-share index fell 60.36 points or 1.91 percent to a provisional close of 3100.16.</p>
<p>"Most of the domestic institutions were sitting quietly," said a trader at a foreign brokerage.</p>
<p>Last week, Bombay's benchmark stocks rose 59.25 points or 1.91 percent to 3160.52 after tumbling 153.46 points or 4.71 percent the week before.</p>
<p>Traders said the rebound was largely a result of purchases by local funds.</p>
<p>"Now that they (local institutions) have stabilised the drop they are staying pretty much on the sidelines. It is quite clear they were there not to make a bull but just stop the downtrend," said a chief dealer at a foreign brokerage.</p>
<p>He said prices had fallen on low volumes.</p>
<p>Traders said a one percentage point cut in the cash reserve ratios of banks -- expected to be announced in the central bank's monetary policy on Saturday -- would ease liquidity and boost sentiment.</p>
<p>But others said a sharp fall in the first half profits of top private firm Reliance Industries -- due on Friday -- was bound to dampen the mood.</p>
<p>"In the shorter-term, the Reliance results may be more important than any cut in CRR," one analyst said. A recent Reuter poll projected the petrochemical major's earnings would shrink 25 percent, hit by poor global prices.</p>
<p>Traders said the market expected a one-for-two bonus share issue from electrical equipment maker ABB on Thursday. But ABB shares fell and some traders forecast a lower bonus ratio.</p>
