<p>Sri Lanka's Tamil Tiger rebels on Saturday said they had lost 140 fighters, including 78 women, in a raid this week on army positions in the north.</p>
<p>Rebel Voice of Tigers radio, monitored by Reuters, said the Tigers destroyed 11 artillery pieces and an ammunition dump during the raid on the Paranthan army base on Thursday.  </p>
<p>The government has said 250 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels died in the attack in which 142 army soldiers were killed and 232 were wounded.</p>
<p>The army said its troops destroyed the artillery pieces and ammunition dump themselves to prevent them falling into rebel hands after the Tigers breached army defences in a human-wave attack early on Thursday.</p>
<p>Rebel radio said the LTTE had captured three 120mm mortars, three heavy machine guns, rifles, artillery shells and a large stock of ammunition as well as night vision goggles.</p>
<p>The rebels are fighting for independence in the north and east of Sri Lanka.</p>
