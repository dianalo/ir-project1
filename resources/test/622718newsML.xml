<p>O.I. Corp, a maker of instruments used to detect and analyze chemical compounds, said Thursday that a federal appeals court in Washington D.C. had affirmed a lower court judgment that a competitor did not infringe on the company's patents.</p>
<p>"We are shocked and disappointed in the outcome of the appeal and are considering if further action in this matter is appropriate," said William Botts, president of O.I.</p>
<p>The company said expenses related to the case incurred as of the year ended December 31, 1996 were $0.15 per share after tax, compared with $0.05 per share after tax the prior year.  </p>
<p>Botts, in a telephone interview, identified the company O.I. sued as Tekmar Co, of Cincinnati, Ohio.</p>
<p>Botts said that the patent infringement complaint, which O.I. filed in March 1995, involved a patent in the field of purge-and-trap concentration technology, used to aid in water testing.</p>
<p>Botts said O.I.'s lawyers are currently reviewing what course of action to take.  He said he did not think that the company would elevate the matter to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>According to an O.I. statement, The U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas granted a motion for summary judgment of non-infringement on June 17, 1996.</p>
<p>"Even though the ruling placed certain limitations on the company's (O.I.) patents in suit, the patents remain valid, and they protect the product manufactured by the company," Botts said in the statement.</p>
<p>A Tekmar spokesman was not immediately available to comment.</p>
