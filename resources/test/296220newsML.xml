<p>An explosive new book by a former top Central Intelligence Agency official provides an unflattering peek at the spy agency and suggests Israel was a treacherous ally during the Panama Canal negotiations.</p>
<p>Entitled "A Spy for All Seasons -- My Life in the CIA," the 430-page memoir was written by Duane Clarridge, who rose to the top echelon of the CIA in the course of a 33-year career in the agency's supersecret clandestine service.</p>
<p>One of its most jarring disclosures concerns a Panamanian military unit that Clarridge considered using as part of U.S. counter-terrorism operations in the 1980s, and the role of Israel -- then and now the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid by far -- in training it.</p>
<p>"The unit I was interested in had actually been developed by the Israelis during the Carter administration at the time of the Panama Canal crisis. In the event that the negotiations with the United States failed, the unit would sabotage the canal," he writes.</p>
<p>Clarridge's reference is to U.S. negotiations with Panama in the late 1970s over the future of the canal that resulted in treaties requiring the United States to cede control of the strategic waterway to the Panamanians by the end of 1999.</p>
<p>But Israel's alleged assistance to Panama in that instance might have been payback for alleged U.S. dealings during a 1976 crisis in Lebanon with the Palestinian who planned and led the 1972 Munich massacre of Olympic athletes.</p>
<p>"The situation in Beirut had deteriorated, and to evacuate everyone (at the U.S. embassy) safely out of the city was going to take some real doing. Through an intermediary, we established a relationship with Ali Hassan Salameh (aka Abu Hassan) of Al Fatah," Clarridge writes, adding the Black September leader wound up covering the U.S. pullout to signal his faction's desire for better relations with Washington.</p>
<p>But the shifting alliances described in the book are only part of its eyebrow-raising, sometimes unintentionally comical content.</p>
<p>Among other things, Clarridge also discloses:</p>
<p>-- That in order to provide food, arms and ammunition to U.S.-backed Contra rebels fighting Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government in the mid-1980s, the CIA "acquired a number of Honduran mules, hoping the guerrillas would use them to establish caches of supplies inside Nicaragua."</p>
<p>"Once inside the country, the guerrillas ate the mules!" Clarridge writes.</p>
<p>-- That the CIA positioned a yacht off Grenada a few days before U.S. forces stormed that island in 1983 to serve as a communications link with CIA agents in Grenada. "However, the U.S. Navy shooed all of the private yachts out of the area, and we were unable to coordinate quickly enough with the navy to allow our yacht to remain in place," he writes.</p>
<p>Clarridge became entangled in the Iran-Contra scandal -- a Reagan administration embarrassment that involved trading arms for U.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian militants in Lebanon -- and resigned under pressure from the CIA in 1988.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury later indicted him on perjury charges lodged by the Iran-Contra special prosecutor, but George Bush, in one of his last acts as president, pardoned Clarridge and several others caught up in the case before they stood trial.</p>
<p>Clearly embittered by that experience, Clarridge is disdainful of the conduct of some of his CIA colleagues during the Iran-Contra probe, including former CIA Director William Webster, whom he describes as "a lightweight ... with no semblance of moral or political fiber."</p>
<p>Clarridge is also contemptuous of John Deutch, who has led the CIA since 1994, claiming that Deutch has bowed to pressure to strip the CIA of its cloak-and-dagger capabilities.</p>
<p>"Mr. Clarridge's views are his own. The agency does not have any comment on his book," CIA spokesman Mark Mansfield said when asked for reaction to "A Spy for All Seasons."</p>
<p>Mansfield noted that Clarridge had submitted his book to the CIA Publications Review Board prior to publication, but said the board's only function was to "ferret out classified information which would be damaging to national security."</p>
<p>"Agency regulations prohibit deletion of material solely because it may be embarrassing to or critical of the CIA," he said.</p>
<p>Clarridge did not respond to a request for an interview, made through Scribners, which published his book.</p>
