<p>Aussie Home Loans said on Friday that it would cut its variable mortgage rate to 6.99 percent from 7.49 percent, effective July 8.  </p>
<p>"We want to continue the pressure on the banking sector because there is some suggestion that some banks might be reluctant to cut further," Aussie Home managing director John Symond said. "We have always been the first off the mark in dropping and we want to maintain that strategy and continue the pressure on the banking sector," he said.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Bank of Australia , one of Australia's big four banks, also cut its mortgage and business rates. The CBA standard variable rate will be cut to 7.20 percent from 7.55 percent and its major business rate to 8.95 percent from 9.25 percent. CBA also lowered its no-frills  </p>

<p>The standard housing rate of the other major banks is set at 7.55 percent. They are National Australia Bank Ltd, Westpac Banking Corp, and the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd.</p>
<p>Aussie Home Loans is a non-bank mortgage originator which is exclusively funded from wholesale market funds raised by the PUMA arm of Macquarie Bank Ltd.</p>
