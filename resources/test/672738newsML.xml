<p>Some Australian stocks to watch this morning:</p>
<p>* QNI Ltd A$2.65 (-0.03)</p>
<p>Strong opposition from institutional investors to QNI's merger deal with Gencor could lead the deal being blocked at the shareholder meeting to decide on the deal, newspapers reported. Institutional investors and some analysts grilled QNI managing director Wynn Davies at a briefing on Thursday, arguing Gencor had been received very favourable terms under the deal.</p>
<p>* Qantas Airways Ltd A$2.96 (unch)</p>
<p>* News Corp Ltd A$6.25 (+0.11)</p>
<p>Ansett, equally owned by News Corp and Air New Zealand,  is expected to announce at 10.45 a.m. (0045 GMT) an alliance with Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand, possibly involving Singapore Airlines buying a stake in Ansett.</p>
<p>* Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd A$19.72 (+0.45)</p>
<p>BHP's ADRs rose US$1.25 or over four percent to US$29.88 in New York on Thursday after analysts revised up their profit forecasts on a strong rise in copper production. The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd also said on Thursday that it and its Central Queensland Coal Associates joint venture partners plan to spend A$500 million on the expansion of the Peak Downs and Saraji open-cut coking coal mines and the port of Hays Point.</p>
