<p>Serbian opposition won a gratifying victory on Tuesday when the parliament reinstated its local election victories but, sceptical of President Slobodan Milosevic's goodwill, signalled more protests.</p>
<p>"The adoption of the bill has solved one problem -- of the election theft. However, these 85 days have showed that there are many other problems left," Zoran Djindjic, one of the three opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition leaders, told Reuters</p>
<p>"The citizens are dissatisfied with many things -- economic poverty, bad media, bad policy, the arrogant attitude of the authorities -- which can be solved only by fundamental reforms.</p>
<p>"If the reforms do not come quickly, and I am thinking in terms of days, I think this process will not only continue but will even expand," he said.</p>
<p>This would be bad news for Milosevic who, facing economic disaster at home, ruined credibility abroad and pressure from the West, hoped to end the paralysing and potentially volatile street protests with the parliament action.</p>
<p>A special law passed by the Serbian parliament reinstates opposition election victories in Serbia's 14 biggest cities, including Belgrade.</p>
<p>The ruling Socialists had annulled the victories on grounds of unspecified "irregularities" -- a move that prompted an international outcry and three months of massive protests.</p>
<p>The huge demonstrations opened up cracks in the leftist monolith which had ruled Serbia for 52 years.</p>
<p>Milosevic, facing the biggest challenge in his 10 years in power and rifts within his party and the police over whether to use force, asked the socialist-dominated parliament to approve a bill recognising the opposition victories.</p>
<p>The Serbian deputies voted 128 in favour of the bill with three abstentions. Zajedno did not attend the session and ultra-nationalists walked out before the vote after obstructing the passage of the bill for hours.</p>
<p>The Serbian parliament also approved a new cabinet in line with Milosevic's promise of quick reforms but opposition leaders dismissed the shuffle as cosmetic.</p>
<p>A deputy prime minister and six other ministers were ousted. Among key changes was the appointment of Milan Beko to head a new ministry that will begin the privatisation of the huge, financially ailing state sector of the economy.</p>
<p>Radmila Milentijevic, a hard-line Milosevic loyalist, was appointed to the information ministry and immediately said the majority of students were not protesting in the streets.</p>
<p>For the past 12 weeks tens of thousands of students have protested against the elections fraud.</p>
<p>Judging by the protesters' reaction to the cabinet shuffle or the passage of the bill, it is unlikely they would cease venting their anger at the authorities, biased state media and the deteriorating economic situation.</p>
<p>"The Socialists are just buying time until the republican and presidential elections. As far as we are concerned, the opposition will have the necessary means to keep fighting on," said Ranko Funjga, a 33-year old Belgrade citizen.</p>
<p>"On November 18 the president of Serbia decided to steal our votes and spat in the face of all people in Serbia," Vesna Pesic, told 60,000 supporters in Belgrade on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>"The regime is terminally ill but we still face a long uphill struggle. We want full media freedom but I'm afraid we shall be seeing each other for quite some time to achieve that," the Nobel peace prize nominee said.</p>
<p>Pesic is one of three peace activists from former Yugoslavia to be nominated for the Nobel prize by the International Peace Bureau.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright issued a personal appeal to Milosevic, urging him to ensure the election results were reinstated and open a dialogue with his opponents.</p>
<p>In what could be an alarming signal of the new government policy line, Milentijevic in turn accused the United States and Germany of meddling in Serbia's internal affairs:</p>
<p>"The influence by the United States and Germany in Serbia's internal affairs is big and that is not such a good thing."</p>
