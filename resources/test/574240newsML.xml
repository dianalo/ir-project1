<p>Iraqi and Turkish officials said they signed a preliminary deal on Saturday to build a gas pipeline to carry Iraqi exports to the Mediterranean port of Ceyhan.</p>
<p>"We have signed an agreement between us under which gas would be transfered from Iraq to world markets," Turkish Energy Minister Recai Kutan said after signing the accord with Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Muhammad Rasheed.</p>
<p>The pipeline would provide Turkey with gas in return for meeting Iraqi needs for products such as food, Kutan said.</p>
<p>Rasheed said they signed a proposal for implementation of the project. The financial arrangment was expected to be agreed in the next few weeks.</p>
<p>"The most important project (agreed) is the 1,300 kilometer long (800 miles) gas pipeline," Rasheed said.</p>
<p>The ministers said the pipeline would cost $2.5 billion and would be capable of carrying 10 billion cubic metres of gas a year.</p>
<p>The ministers made no mention of when work would start on the project, or how long it would take to complete.</p>
<p>Apart from an oil-for-food concession, Iraq is banned from exporting oil under United Nations sanctions imposed on it for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>The oil-for-food deal allows Baghdad to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months to buy food, medicine and humanitarian needs.</p>
<p>He said a sales deal between Baghdad and Ankara would be reached by the end of this year.</p>
