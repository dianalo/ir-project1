<p>Qatar is close to signing an agreement with one or more foreign companies to develop the Idd Al Shargi South Dome (ISSD) oil field, the OPEC news agency (OPECNA) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"We have received four offers from four international oil companies to appraise and develop the ISSD field," Qatar General Petroleum Corp's (QGPC) manager for exploration and crude oil development Rashid al Sulaiti told a QGPC publication, according to OPECNA.</p>
<p>ISSD is located nearly 150 km northeast of Doha and is adjacent to the Idd Al Shargi North Dome (ISND) field, which produces an average 80,000 bpd under the operatorship of Occidental Petroleum Corp of the United States.</p>
<p>Al Sulaiti said QCPC was also considering signing exploration and production-sharing agreements for three more oilfields.</p>
<p>"These include block 2 (south) and block 2 (north), both onshore, and located near Dukhan, and block 7 (offshore), located east of Doha," he said.</p>
