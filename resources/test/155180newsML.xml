<p>Toyota Motor Corp said on Wednesday it had no comment on a newspaper report that it planned to shift production of its Scepter models from the United States to Japan.</p>
<p>The Yomiuri Shimbun reported on Wednesday that Toyota would shift output of its Scepter Wagons and Scepter Coupes from its U.S. unit to Japan when remodelled versions are launched in December because of the weaker yen.</p>
<p>"We cannot make any comment about our future products," a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Toyota Motor unit Toyota Motor Manufacturing Kentucky (TMMK) stopped making the Scepter station wagon in June because of poor U.S. demand.</p>
<p>Industry sources said Toyota would shift production to Japan, but attributed it to slack demand in the United States and not the weak yen.</p>
<p>Also, TMMK will start producing a minivan next summer, the sources said. The U.S. minivan market already stands at 1.2 million units a year and is growing rapidly.</p>
<p>Honda Motor Co Ltd said last week it was considering moving production of one of its popular estate car models, the Accord Wagon, from the United States to Japan.</p>
