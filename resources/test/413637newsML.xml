<p>Vice President Al Gore played the central role in soliciting at least $40 million in campaign money for the Democratic Party during the 1996 election, the Washington Post reported in Sunday editions.</p>
<p>Through his activities, Gore built the most formidable fund-raising network in U.S. politics, often asking for contributions in private phone calls in a manner several large Democratic donors described as heavy handed and inappropriate for an incumbent vice president, the paper said.</p>
<p>Donors and party officials said fund raising and government action became intermingled in at least one instance, when Gore called to thank a Texas telecommunications executive after his firm gave $100,000 to the DNC.</p>
<p>The Post quoted officials saying the contribution was intended in part as a reward to the administration for its efforts to help the firm win a $36 million telecommunications contract in Mexico.</p>
<p>The front-page report was based on records, documents and interviews with more than 100 organisers, donors and officials.</p>
<p>Republicans and at least one Democrat have called for an independent counsel to look into the widening fund-raising controversy and allegations that some foreign countries like China were seeking illegal influence.</p>
<p>In its latest report, the Washington Post said Gore became known at the Democratic National Committee as the administration's "soliciter-in-chief" after President Bill Clinton adamantly refused to directly request contributions.</p>
<p>Gore spokeswoman Lorraine Voles told the Post on Friday, "there is nothing inappropriate about the vice president calling people for money."</p>
<p>It is not illegal for a vice president to solicit campaign contributions, but Gore's activities were apparently unprecedented, the Post said, quoting other vice presidents who said they never solicited contributions.</p>
<p>DNC records showed that Gore also played a traditional fund-raising role in attending 39 events as the principal attraction, raising $8.74 million in 1995-96 for the DNC.</p>
<p>He was the main attraction at 23 White House coffees and joined Clinton at another eight. He also used the vice president's residence for a number of activities, including a key fund-raiser for 50 supporters who had already raised at least $100,000, the Post reported.</p>
<p>The Post quoted DNC officials and donors as saying Gore raised at least $40 million of the $180 million raised by the DNC in 1995-1996.</p>
<p>James Hormel, chairman of Equidex Inc., told the Post Gore called him in October 1995 to ask for a donation to a DNC advertising campaign, citing "a sense of urgency" to the call.</p>
<p>Another executive who declined to be identified recalled Gore phoning and saying, "I've been tasked with raising $2 million by the end of the week and you're on my list."</p>
<p>The donor, a longtime Gore friend and supporter, gave $100,000, but said he felt pressured by the vice president's sale pitch. "It's revolting," he told the Post.</p>
<p>Another executive said, "There were elements of a shakedown in the call. It was very awkward. For a vice president, particularly this vice president who has real power and is the heir apparent, to ask for money gave me no choice. I have so much business that touches on the federal government -- the telecommunications act, tax policy, regulations galore," according to the Post.</p>
<p>The donor said he sent the DNC a check for $100,000.</p>
