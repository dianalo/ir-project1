<p>Singapore gas oil prices rose in tandem with swaps which was catching up with rises seen last Friday in London and the U.S., traders said.</p>
<p>But traders said the market was largely quiet as many players were away for an International Petroleum Exchange (IPE) conference and a holiday in the U.S.</p>
<p>They said supplies were also being exhausted by recent regional sales and the effects of Singapore refineries cutting runs. But some traders said, as refining margins improved, refineries might soon restore production.  </p>
<p>Expectations that China could soon resume gas oil imports for March deliveries were also exciting the market, but Chinese enquiries of around $198 per tonne, c&amp;f, were considered too low. Sellers were indicating $204 a tonne.</p>
<p>Traders said China bought two 30,000-tonne gas oil cargoes before the Lunar New year break from a South Korean refiner at a 10-cent-per-barrel premium to Singapore spot quotes, free-on-board (fob) basis.</p>
<p>Traders also said gas oil prices also firmed as a local trader, which has been pricing Middle East cargoes over the past month, had completed its pricing exercise.  </p>
<p>Two traders on Monday appeared to sell at high levels. One trader started at $26.45 a barrel for March 4-8 while another started at $26.80 for March 14-18 lifting fob. But both later reduced their offers to $26.00.</p>
<p>A buyer was seen for a 200,000-barrel cargo for March 4-8 lifting at $25.70 a barrel fob, 20 cents more than its bid on Friday. Nothing was traded on the physical market.</p>
<p>But March gas oil swaps traded late in the day at $26.25 a barrel, up from Friday's $25.75.  </p>
<p>Jet fuel prices have also stabilised after a recent plunge, as supplies were said to be short. Traders also said the exit of a local trader, who had been pricing its sales to Indonesia at over $30.00 over the past month, also helped to soften prices to around $28.70 a barrel.</p>
<p>The swaps March jet fuel/gas oil regrade has also widened again to bid $2.40 a barrel, up from Friday's bid of $2.00.  </p>
