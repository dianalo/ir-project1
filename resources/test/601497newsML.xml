<p>Turnover on the central market fell to 670,000 litas from 930,000 litas.</p>
<p>"I'm not pessimistic," said Grazina Bachiuliene, a broker with Vilfima.</p>

<p>Vilniaus Bank shares rose to 240.00 litas from 232.00 litas on the central market, on turnover of 240,000 litas.</p>
<p>"I don't expect the price to be higher than 240.00 litas or 250.00 litas in the near future," Berzinskas said.</p>
<p>Hermis Bank shares slid to 178.00 litas from 180.00 on light turnover of almost 89,000 litas. Brokers see Hermis, which released positive results for the first four months of the year, as having rooom to grow.</p>
<p>"Compared to Vilniaus Bank, the price for Hermis is very low," said Arvydas Jacikevicius, a broker with Suprema.</p>
<p>In block trading, Vilniaus Department Store was active in turnvover of 420,000 litas at a price of 100.00 litas.</p>
