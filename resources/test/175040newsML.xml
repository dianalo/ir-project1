<p>Tokyo stocks rose in early morning trade on Thursday, inspired by U.S. markets which closed sharply higher overnight on post-election jubilation, brokers said. They said buy-backs and futures-linked trades were leading cash stocks higher.</p>
<p>At 0016 GMT, the key Nikkei 225 was 113.29 points or 0.54 percent higher at 21,104.81. Its December futures were 50 points higher at 21,150.</p>
<p>"The Nikkei average will try to consolidate around the 21,000 level today if it can, supported by buy-backs by dealers and arbitrage activity," a dealer at "big four" brokerage said.</p>
