<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures ended down sharply Thursday in an active session, with a bearish inventory report and more moderate weekend weather forecasts undermining cash and paper prices, sources said.</p>
<p>July expired 8.2 cents lower at $2.145 per million British thermal units. August slumped nine cents to close at $2.123. Other deferreds ended down by 1.7 to 9.3 cents.</p>
<p>"(Bearish) AGAs, no additional weather and some nukes coming back all pressured the market. Then when July couln't hold above unchanged, it killed it," said one Midwest trader, adding an August close below $2.105 would be very bearish.  </p>
<p>PECO said it expected its 1,055 MW Limerick 1 nuke unit in Pennsylvania, shut last weekend due to a leaking valve, to be back on line Friday.</p>
<p>Most agreed Wednesday's unexpectedly-large 97 bcf weekly AGA stock build coupled with late-week forecasts for more seasonal Northeast weather set the stage for long liquidation.</p>
<p>Weather in Texas and the Southwest was expected to drift around normal, while heat was expected to persist in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Chart traders pegged August support along the up trendline at $2.105, with more buying expected at the recent $2.08 low. Trendline resistance was seen at $2.27, with further selling likely at the recent $2.36 high and then at the $2.415 contract high.</p>
<p>In the cash Thursday, June Gulf Coast gas tumbled almost 10 cents to about the $2.20 area, with July on the same pipes pegged in the mid-teens. June Midcon lost a similar amount to the low-$2s. New York city gate gas was quoted in the low-$2.50s, down from the $2.60s Wednesday.</p>
<p>The NYMEX 12-month Henry Hub strip skidded 6.3 cents to $2.208. NYMEX said 94,197 contracts traded, up sharply from Wednesday's revised tally of 65,527.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, August finished eight lower at $2.00, while deferreds ended down by 4.5 to 7.5 cents. The August East/West spread narrowed by one cent to 12.3 cents (NYMEX premium). KCBT said 249 lots traded, down sharply from Wednesday's total of 1,256.</p>
