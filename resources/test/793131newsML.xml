<p>CS First Boston said it maintained its 'buy' rating on Danubius after the hotel group released mixed first half results.</p>
<p>"Danubius perplexed the market with its H1 results," analyst Spencer Jakab said. "Pretax income was up 39.2 percent year on year...but operating income was down 33.6 percent, while group sales rose by 7.8 percent."</p>
<p>Danubius's pre-tax profits for January to June rose to 2.524 billion from 1.813 billion in 1996 while operating profit was down at 1.104 billion forints, compared to 1.663 billion forints in the first half of last year, the company reported on Monday.</p>
<p>Net sales rose by less than inflation to 8.96 billion forints from 8.314 billion in the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>The results caused CSFB to revise the 1997 earnings per share forecast upwards but reduce the 1998 and 1999 prognoses.</p>
<p>Jakab said distortions in the H1 figures were caused by a discount received on the purchase with compensation coupons of Hungarhotels, an indebted Hungarhotels in 1996 versus a relatively debt free company this year, and a weak mark, the currency in which Danubius conducts most of its tour contracts.</p>
<p>He added that the figures do not portray the fundamentals of the company: occupancy rose 1.1 percent while rooms remained staedy in hard currency terms, he said, adding that the bulk of the growth was at Hungarhotels, the least profitable part of the company.</p>
<p>He predicted a strong third quarter and loss-making fourth quarter in line with seasonal variations.</p>
<p>"This is one of those cases in which one has to more or less ignore the company's financials," the report said, adding that the company is likely to sell 50 percent of Hungarhotels within the next year.</p>
<p>"The key to Danubius' share price remains the break-up value, which is somewhat in excess of 8,200 forints per share," Jakab said.</p>
<p>"We feel that this value will be better appreciated by the market late this year/early next once Danubius is forced to unload its 50 percent stake in Hungary.</p>
<p>"We maintain a buy on Danubius based on its appeal as value stock," the CSFB report concluded.</p>
