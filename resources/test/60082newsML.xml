<p>Anglo-Dutch Computer Management Group (CMG) said on Tuesday it expected second half results to outpace first half pretax profit of 11.3 million sterling compared with 8.6 million in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>"I know the results up until August and we expect that the second half year will be better than the first half...It is an order-driven forecast," chairman Cor Stutterheim told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>The company that was floated on the London and Amsterdam stock exchanges last year said its second half year was traditionally better than the first half.</p>
<p>CMG's 31 percent pretax profit rise was faster than CMG's rise in turnover of 23 percent to 116.6 million sterling from 94.6 million in the comparable period in 1995.</p>
<p>"The market is very strong and we're outpacing the average," Stutterheim said, adding he stuck to an average growth of the Dutch and British computer consultancy and services market of 10-15 percent.</p>
<p>"When we look at our client base, we see that the market is growing between 10 and 15 percent," he said.</p>
<p>CMG's fastest growing business remained in the Netherlands, where turnover rose to 79.8 million sterling from 60.5 million.</p>
