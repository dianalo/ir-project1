<headline>FOCUS-Northwest in MOU for 50 Airbus jets.</headline>
<dateline>PARIS, France 1997-06-19</dateline>

<p>European aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie said on Thursday that U.S. carrier Northwest Airlines had signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) for 50 firm orders and up to 100 options on A319 jets.</p>
<p>The value of the 50 aircraft is estimated at about $2 billion, based on an average price of around $40 million for an A319. The MOU is a commitment to buy rather than a firm order.</p>
<p>Airbus said delivery of the 125-seat, twin-engine jets are scheduled for 1999 through 2003.</p>
<p>"We are hopeful that this memorandum of understanding will result in a final agreement in the near future," Airbus quoted John Dasburg, Northwest's chief executive officer, as saying.</p>
<p>The A319 is a smaller version of the A320 and A321. All three aircraft feature identical flight decks and the widest passenger cabins of any single aisle aircraft, Airbus said.</p>
<p>Northwest currently operates 50 A320s and has an additional previously announced contract for 20 A320s to be delivered in 1998 and 1999.</p>
<p>Airbus is a consortium made up of French state-owned Aerospatiale, British Aerospace Plc, Daimler-Benz Aerospace, a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, and Construcciones Aeronauticas SA (CASA) of Spain.</p>
