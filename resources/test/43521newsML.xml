<p>Prices of Russian MinFin bonds rose in lively trading on Tuesday as worries about President Boris Yeltsin's health and the problem of stolen bonds seemed to have moved into the background, dealers said.</p>
<p>		 tranche  Sept 10		 Sept 9</p>
<p> 1999 maturity (3)    75.60-75.85	   75.15-75.45</p>
<p> 2003 maturity (4)    48.65-48.90	   48.20-48.50</p>
<p> 2008 maturity (5)    31.70-31.95	   31.30-31.60</p>
<p> 2006 maturity (6)    37.75-38.00	   37.60-37.90</p>
<p> 2011 maturity (7)    27.65-28.00	   27.70-28.00</p>
<p>"Almost all prices are going up, no one seems to care much now about Yeltsin's operation or stolen bonds," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin will have a heart operation probably at the end of September in Moscow.</p>
<p>Banking sources told Reuters in late August that Russian police are preparing an order to freeze further bonds of up to $7 million nominal which had been stolen. In June the authorities froze $24.22 million nominal of stolen bonds.</p>
<p>"Market liquidity has risen this week... London operators, who usually support prices, are also buying now while Russians have already raised long positions and are waiting for the time to take profits," another dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said Russia's hopes of getting an attractive credit rating for its first Eurobond issue could also encourage some investment buying.</p>
<p>Economy Minister Yevgeny Yasin said Russia hoped to get a credit rating similar to that of Greece, Spain, or Portugal for its first Eurobond issue.</p>
