<p>Credit Lyonnais Belgium (CLB), a unit of French group Credit Lyonnais, said on Monday the bank was not for sale.  </p>
<p>CLB chief executive officer Philippe Cloes told a news conference on 1996 earnings, "Credit Lyonnais France has no intention whatsoever of selling CLB...for three reasons:</p>
<p>- it would not sell a profitable unit;</p>
<p>- Belgium borders on France and CL France wants to cover its borders;</p>
<p>- thirdly, we play a key role with a number of specialities in the group, notably in retail (banking), in which we are considered innovative...we are a laboratory for the group."</p>
<p>"The probability of us being sold is very small."  </p>
<p>Belgian media have frequently speculated on a sale of CLB.</p>
<p>Cloes has repeatedly denied this.</p>
<p>The idea of a selloff gained new prominence after news last Friday that Belgian cooperative bank Bacob planned to buy Bank Paribas Belgium to widen its range of services ahead of the planned introduction of the euro in 1999.</p>
<p>The merger brings together Belgium's seventh and eight largest banks in a group which includes insurance company DVV/LAP and stock broking firm Smeets, Verbaet.</p>
