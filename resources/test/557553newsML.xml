<p>Traded contracts of South Korea's stock index futures reached 6,000 per day in April, up from 3,500 contracts in May 1996 when it was introduced on the Seoul bourse, the Korea Stock Exchange (KSE) said on Friday.</p>
<p>The exchange said in a statement published ahead of its first anniversary on Saturday that the country's first derivatives market had a successful year with steady growth in trading volume for the KOSPI 200 index futures.</p>
<p>The statement said the average daily trading volume was about 4,490 contracts or 175 billion won for the period, accounting for 35 percent of the underlying cash market's trading volume.</p>
<p>Open interest also rose, reaching 12,000 contracts on Friday, from 1,500 contracts a year ago. With increasing open interest, foreign participation in the derivatives market has gradually expanded, the KSE statement said.</p>
<p>At present, foreign participation is restricted to 30 percent of the average daily open interest for the last three months, it said.</p>
<p>For the past year, securities companies represented 75 percent of the total trading volume, followed by individual investors with 18 percent and foreign investors with nearly three percent, the statement said.  </p>
<p>Institutional investors have not participated as much as expected, it said. More recently, investment trust companies have shown increasing interest in the derivatives market by launching financial products using KOSPI 200 futures contracts.</p>
<p>The Korean futures market has experienced a wide deviation. During the one-year period, deviation of actual futures prices from theoretical prices was 2.1 percent on average, it said.</p>
<p>The main reason behind the wide deviation was the lack of arbitrage trading which resulted from problems in accounting rules and securities lending arrangements, it said.</p>
<p>The index futures market has not significantly affected the stock market. The so-called Triple Witching Hour Effect was rarely found on the settlement day, it said.</p>
<p>The KSE would make efforts to attract more institutional investors to its derivatives market by encouraging removal of regulatory and technical impediments, it said.</p>
<p>At the same time, the KSE would also conform its trading and clearing rules to international practices by introducing the risk-based margin system and shortening the settlement period to "T+1" from "T+2" on July 7, when the stock index options market is scheduled to launch, the statement said.</p>
