<p>The Hungarian state repurchased the loss-making Polgari Bank unit of Budapest Bank (BB), which is controlled by the U.S.'s General Electric Capital Services, the finance ministry said in a statement on Monday.</p>
<p>GE Capital Services, which has operational control of the bank, bought a 27.4 percent stake in BB last December.</p>
<p>The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is a financial investor, has 32.4 percent, the Hungarian state 22.8 percent and other investors 17.4 percent of the bank.</p>
<p>GE and the EBRD bought the combined stake for $87 million.</p>
<p>The state bought Polgari Bank according to the guarantee, which it undertook in the privatisation contracts, for the repurchase of assets worth up to 8.25 billion forints.</p>
<p>The government purchased Polgari at a price equivalent to its net book value, the finance ministry said.</p>
<p>It did not disclose further financial details of the deal.</p>
<p>The statement added that the original privatisation contracts also included a guarantee from the state for the repurchase of BB shares, but this guarantee was abolished in a later agreement.</p>
