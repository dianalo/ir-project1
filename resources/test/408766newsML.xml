<p>The European Commission said on Thursday it had been formally notified of Boeing Co's proposed acquisition of control of McDonnell Douglas Corp.</p>
<p>It said the deal was submitted to the Commission for clearance on February 18 under the European Union's merger regulation which bans creation or strengthening of dominant positions in the 15-nation market.</p>
<p>European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert has already indicated he is worried the alliance may harm fair competition.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the regulation, the Commission has one month from the day the operation was notified to clear the deal or start an in-depth probe which could last up to four months.</p>
<p>The notice was published in the EU's Official Journal of February 26. Interested parties have 10 days to file comments. -- Brussels Newsroom 32 2 287 6800</p>
