<p>The exploration company of Royal Dutch Shell Group in Nigeria on Monday denied that it had found large reserves of crude oil from its deep offshore drilling off the Nigerian coast.</p>
<p>"Reports that the Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company of Nigeria (SNEPCO) has found 2.2 billion barrels of oil reserves from appraisal drilling in its deepwater concessions are unfounded," the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>A senior Shell official told Reuters on Friday that results from the Bonga and Ngolo prospects in Shell's deep offshore concessions were "very encouraging."</p>
<p>He said the first well drilled in oil prospecting licence (OPL) 212 showed a crude oil reserve estimated at about 575 million barrels while the second well held reserves estimated at 700 million barrels.</p>
<p>"Evaluation of our other well drilled in OPL 219 indicated a reserve holding of about one billion barrels," he added.</p>
<p>SNEPCO said it had so far drilled only one exploration well in each of its two oil prospecting leases.</p>
<p>"In OPL 212, hydrocarbons were found and a follow-up appraisal well is being drilled to give further information about reserves.</p>
<p>"In OPL 219 the results of the exploration well are still being evaluated," the company statement added.</p>
<p>SNEPCO was set up in 1991 to operate in the deep offshore waters for Shell.</p>
<p>The company said it had made no official annoucement from the exploration because the evaluation process was still on.</p>
<p>Outgoing managing director of Shell Nigeria, Brian Anderson said at his valedictory news briefing last week that production from the deep offshore wells would begin before the end of this century.</p>
