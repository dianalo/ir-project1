<p>A U.S. Transportation Department official said on Wednesday that the department was ready to resume talks with Britain on an "open skies" aviation accord, but that such an accord might be reached with France first.</p>
<p>Talks on a new agreement had been periodically held the past year, but a new round set for last month was called off by the United States following what it described as a British proposal that was far short of any basis for discussions.  </p>
<p>Britain has balked at opening London Heathrow airport, the base of British Airlines, to more flights by American carriers, a chief U.S. demand.</p>
<p>The department official, who asked he not be identified, said the two sides remain in touch and that the United States stood ready to reopen negotiations toward an accord ending restrictions on aviation services.</p>
<p>But he said France has shown some desire to renew its aviation accord with the United States and it might be the next large country that reaches a free market aviation pact.  </p>
<p>Germany is now the only major country that has an "open skies" accord with the United States. Such accords typically allow an airline in one country to fly to any city in the other, as well as to and from third countries.</p>
<p>The United States had hoped to reach an "open skies" pact with Britain this year, paving the way for a proposed marketing alliance between BA and American Airlines</p>
<p>U.S. officials said they would not approve the antitrust immunity being sought for the alliance until the two countries had reached an "open skies" accord.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, AA released a survey that showed that more than 80 percent of U.S. international travelers backed an "open skies" accord between the United States and Britain as well as the proposed AA-BA alliance.</p>
<p>AA said the poll by Peter Hart Research and Wirthlin Worldwide found 82 percent supporting an "open skies" accord and 83 supprting the proposed alliance.</p>
<p>"This survey clearly demonstrates how imnportant a U.S.-UK open skies agreement and the American-BA alliance are to international travelers," said Will Ris, AA's vice president for governmental affairs.</p>
