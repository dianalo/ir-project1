<p>Namibian groups Namibian Fishing Industries Ltd (Namfish) and Namibian Sea Products Ltd (Namsea) are to merge in a bid to up their capital base, the firms said Tuesday in statements with their half year results.</p>
<p>On September 30 the firms issued a cautionary statement saying they were in talks likely to effect their share prices. Now, in announcements in South African newspapers, a planned merger has been revealed.</p>
<p>"The directors have taken the decision to merge Namfish and Namsea with a view to creating a single entity with a stronger capital base. Advice is being sought on how best to achieve this," the firms said.</p>
<p>They added shareholders would be kept informed of future developments.</p>
<p>The news came at the same time as both firms, who already have an element of cross-shareholding, posted slips into the red. </p>
<p>Namfish saw attributable income slip to a $N13.63 million loss from a $N0.86 million profit, while Namsea saw a $N5.05 million profit turn into a $N5.31 million loss. </p>
<p>The main factor has been the total absence of any pilchard catches during the allotted fishing period.</p>
<p>"By the time the season closed on August 31 not a single can of pilchards had been produced in Walvis Bay from pilchards caught in Namibian waters," Namsea said.</p>
<p>The group added many scientists were baffled by the absence of fish. </p>
<p>"Research scientists have not been able to identify with any certainty the reasons for the non-availability of pilchards in Namibian waters nor for the shortage of fish generally," the firm said.</p>
