<p>German commentators said on Monday a battle between the Bundesbank and the goverment over Finance Minister Theo Waigel's plans to revalue the central bank's reserves could tear the ruling coalition apart and cause turmoil across Europe.</p>
<p>Several leading newspapers urged Waigel to accept the Bundesbank's objections to revaluing its gold and currency reserves, saying he should scrap ill-conceived ideas on reducing government debt with quick cash profits from the central bank.</p>
<p>Several dailies said the government could no longer be sure of its slim 12-seat parliamentary majority because some deputies from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU) and his Free Democrat (FDP) coalition partners were threatening not to vote for a bill against the will of the respected Bundesbank.</p>
<p>"It is the right thing, but the wrong time," wrote the conservative daily Die Welt in an editorial. "Waigel's position may not seem so objectionable from a legal point of view, but his sudden grab for the gold should nevertheless be condemned."</p>
<p>It added: "Waigel should immediately abandon his plans to revalue the gold. It would be more honest to finally admit that the Maastricht Treaty doesn't require a perfect landing for the EMU criteria. If this doesn't happen, the currency union as well as the European Union itself will be in danger."</p>
<p>Chancellor Helmut Kohl held a crisis meeting with Waigel and leaders from his centre-right coalition government on Sunday night to discuss the gold revaluation plan and a hole in the budget.</p>
<p>Waigel aims to reap 20 billion marks ($12 billion) from the central bank asset revaluation that could partly ease the government's debt burden and help to meet the entry criteria for the European Union's economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>The decision on which countries qualify for the single currency will be based on 1997 data. The EU's Maastricht Treaty lays down the timetable and criteria for EMU.</p>
<p>"It would be better if the governing parties would leave the opposition work to the opposition parties," wrote the tabloid Bild. "Or are there those in the governing parties with a special zeal to move quickly into the opposition?"</p>
<p>Bild, Germany's largest selling daily, urged both the government and the Bundesbank to take some small steps towards each other rather than continue to poison the atmosphere with public threats.</p>
<p>"We Germans are fighting at the top of our voices and full of disharmony over every percentage point and every deciminal point," it said. "Every minister throws himself in front of every camera to state his unyielding position."</p>
<p>The conservative Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper said Kohl's coalition had manoeuvered itself into "a most unenviable" position by taking on the Bundesbank to help to plug budget holes and was now fighting a "growing sense of despair."</p>
<p>"Waigel's financial policies have made it difficult for Germany to qualify for EMU and have damaged Germany's ambitions to lead the march into the currency union," it said. "The government can try to counter the will of the Bundesbank, but it may not be able to count on its slim majority holding up."</p>
<p>Martin Kothe, in a commentary for N-TV television, said the FDP had its back to the wall because Waigel would pressure the party to drop its opposition to tax increases in order to fill budget holes that could defuse the gold row.</p>
<p>"The FDP probably will not commit suicide by leaving the coalition, but there is no doubt that this is a bona fide crisis for the government and nothing can be ruled out," he said.</p>
