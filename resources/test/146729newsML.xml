<p>NYMEX November electricity futures closed sharply higher on Monday after setting new contract highs on strength in natural gas prices and emerging heating demand in the northwestern U.S.</p>
<p>A price hike of daily offers by Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) also bolstered both cash and futures prices in the western U.S., brokers and marketers said.</p>
<p>Cold weather combined with strong demand for strong injection into storage rallied natural gas prices in the West and Canada for the second day.  </p>
<p>Spot natgas prices jumped on average 15 to 20 cents today compared with Friday's values. The benchmark value at Henry Hub offshore Louisiana for swing delivery was quoted at $2.71-$2.74 per million British thermal units, up sharply from Friday's range of $2.42-$2.45.</p>
<p>November California-Oregon Border (COB) futures expired up 64 cents at $21.92 a megawatt hour (MWh), almost halving the gain from  a life-of-contract high at $22.95.</p>
<p>December COB finished up $1.17 at $22.50. Deferred COB contracts ended five to $1.25 higher than Friday's close.  </p>
<p>November Palo Verde (PV) futures expired up $1.17 at $20.67 after hitting a new contract at $20.95.</p>
<p>December PV finished up $1.30 at $20.00, off from a high of $20.50. Other PV months ended 10 cents to a dollar higher.</p>
<p>The rally in the NYMEX electricity complex was expected to continue when December futures debut as the spot contracts open Tuesday.</p>
<p>"In a normal case I would say 'no' but nobody wants to pick the top here, natgas just keeps getting stronger," a Houston trader said.</p>
<p>"I think there's still some room on the upside," echoed another Houston trader, but cautioned the complex could ready tumble on bearish weather forecasts.</p>
<p>In the next six to 10 days, the western U.S. were predicted to experience normal to warmer-than-normal autumn weather.</p>
