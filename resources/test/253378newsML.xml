<p>Iraq has launched a tender in the grain market to import 100,000 tonnes of French wheat during January and February, grain traders in Paris said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Grain markets had been waiting for a move to buy wheat as Iraq prepares to sell limited quantities of oil under a U.N.-approved scheme to raise money for food and medicine.  </p>
<p>Traders said the grain would come in two equal shipments of 50,000 tonnes and could be the start of purchases to meet Iraq's need for two million tones of wheat and other basic goods.</p>
<p>"All we need to know is whether they are going to buy 100,000 tonnes, 500,000 tonnes or a million," a source close to the negotiations said.</p>
<p>The Turkish news agency Anatolia said earlier that tanker loadings of Iraqi oil through Turkey would resume on Friday for the first time in six years.</p>
<p>France, which conditionally backs Iraq's call for an end to sanctions imposed after the 1990 invasion of Kuwait, is expected to be among the first Western beneficiaries of oil and grain deals under the six-month U.N. plan for humanitarian relief.</p>
