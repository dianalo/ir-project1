<headline>Telefonica de Espana's history up to privatisation.</headline>
<dateline>MADRID 1997-01-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>Spain's telecoms operator Telefonica de Espana, which is to be fully privatised next month, started out as a private company when it was set up by U.S. operator International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation (ITT) in 1924.</p>
<p>Telefonica de Espana was nationalised under the dictatorship of General Francisco Franco in 1946 and spent more than two decades under complete state control before Franco started to sell off some shares in a populist appeal in the late 1960s.</p>
<p>The original shares were Spain's first major public offer and they became one of the most rock solid in the Spanish bourse throughout the 1970s and 80s.</p>
<p>They were affectionately called "matildes" after a radio and television spot that had a man on a street shouting up to his wife, "Matilde, let's go, the shares in Telefonica are ready".</p>
<p>By 1991, the state's direct and indirect participation had been whittled down to 33.7 percent of the group's share capital.</p>
<p>The Socialist government made the first modern placement of Telefonica in the Madrid bourse in October 1995, selling off 10.7 percent and reducing the state's stake to 21.01 percent.</p>
<p>The offer failed to impress institutional investors and the demand was so weak that the 10 million shares held in reserve as a greenshoe against oversubscription remained untouched.</p>
<p>To add insult to injury, share prices tumbled 11 percent after the offer from a retail price of 1,615 pesetas to 1,429 pesetas at the end of October.</p>
<p>The shares recovered gradually and after the initial nerve wrangling, more than compensated investors by nearly doubling in value since the end of 1995.</p>
<p>Telefonica shares closed on Thursday at 3,315 pesetas.</p>
<p>Besides the Madrid bourse, the Spanish telecoms operator quotes in the international markets in Frankfurt, Paris, London, New York and Tokyo and for foreign investors Telefonica's shares are now synonymous with Spanish shares. -- Madrid Newsroom 34-1 585-2160</p>
