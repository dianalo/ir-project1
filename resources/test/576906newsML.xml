<p>International bond investors should look to Spain and Portugal in preference to Italy, economists believe, but they they warn that risks remain with all the peripheral European markets.</p>
<p>Their comments come as European Union economic and finance ministers on Monday welcomed Portugal and Spain's economic convergence programmes to qualify for the European single currency. "The (Portuguese) plan was overwhelming applauded," said one EU diplomat in Brussels. The glowing appraisals for Spain and Portugal contrast sharply with the expected assessment for Italy, a country still struggling under the weight of relatively high budget deficits.</p>
<p>"The spread between Italy and Spain is around 70 basis points, and there could be some mileage in that spread," said Ken Wattret, international economist at Paribas Capital Markets in London.</p>
<p>Both countries' debt markets are on a roll.</p>
<p>The Bank of Portugal cut interest rates on Friday in a surprise early move ahead of this week's release of April inflation data.</p>
<p>Ten-year Spanish bond futures broke a contract high last week, and a Spanish rate cut is also expected this week, if April CPI data, due on Wednesday, is low.</p>
<p>Italian government BTPs weakened on Monday, after the European Commission recommended to EU member states that they tell Italy it is falling short of the goal for the single currency and should take measures to bring its public deficit in line with Maastricht Treaty goals.</p>
<p>"Spain and Portugal could be in a reasonable position to enter EMU in the first wave," said Wattret.</p>
<p>"There could be decoupling between Spain and Portugal and the Italian equivalent, and we have seen early signs of that."</p>
<p>Italian bonds were trading at a 162 basis point spread differential to German government Bunds at 1018 GMT, while Spanish bonds showed an 89 basis point yield gap.</p>
<p>But Keith Edmonds, chief analyst at IBJ International in London, thought the fervour for Iberian bond markets was overdone.</p>
<p>He saw an upbeat week for Spanish bonds this week followed longer term by a static Spanish bonos/Bund spread of 90 basis points on a three month horizon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Italy could narrow its spread with  Germany and tighten to 155 basis points over the same period, Edmonds added.</p>
<p>"We have seen the Spanish market fully discounting a 25 basis point rate cut as early as Friday, while there is still a significant chance of a rate cut in Italy."</p>
<p>The release next week of Italian inflation data for May could be a trigger for a drop in Italian interest rates, Edmonds said.</p>
<p>Bullish sentiments emerging from Monday's Ecofin meeting are likely to be overshadowed by events in core Europe, which have more capacity to derail the European economic and monetary union (EMU) process, said Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW in London.</p>
<p>Germany will release half-yearly tax estimates this week.</p>
<p>A high shortfall in German tax receipts will have a knock-on effect on EMU confidence, Reed said.</p>
<p>The French political scene ahead of elections on May 25 and June 1 is also creating tension, she added, despite an improved performance for the ruling centre-right in the most recent pre-election polls.</p>
<p>"There is a significant risk that we run into a period of underperformance in all the peripheral markets," Reed said.</p>
<p>She saw the BTP/Bund spread widening to 200 or even 250 basis points over the next couple of months, while the bonos/Bund spread could stretch to 150 basis points.</p>
