<p>The third suspicious fire in 10 days erupted at a records warehouse in South Brunswick Wednesday.</p>
<p>About 200 companies store some 800,000 business documents at the facility, which is owned by Iron Mountain Inc., a records management company based in Boston. The corporation has 117 storage centres in 35 cities nationwide.</p>
<p>The two previous blazes -- on March 10 and again on Monday 17 -- occurred at the smaller of the facility's two buildings.</p>
<p>One-quarter of the boxes of documents stored in that warehouse were damaged during those fires, company spokeswoman Judith Brackley said. She added that the company had stationed around-the-clock guards at the central New Jersey facility after the first blaze.</p>
<p>Brackley said she expected there would be significantly less salvageable material left after Wednesday's fire at the larger building. The three-alarm blaze raged for hours starting at mid-morning, sending flames high into the air.</p>
<p>Over 100 firefighters battled the fire. One firefighter was reportedly treated for smoke inhalation and another person was treated for minor injuries. There were no injuries in the previous blazes, Brackley said.</p>
<p>Local authorities reportedly suspect arson. According to CBS Radio, the South Brunswick police department has posted a $10,000 reward for the criminal's capture.</p>
