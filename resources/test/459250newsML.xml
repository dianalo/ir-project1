<p>Space Systems/Loral Inc. said it signed a contract Friday to build a $200 million communications satellite for China Telecommunications Broadcast Satellite Corp.</p>
<p>The unit of Loral Space &amp; Communications Ltd. will provide Chinasat with an 11,000-watt satellite operating on two frequencies to be put in orbit in late 1998, said Henry Stackpole, president of Loral Asia Pacific.</p>
<p>The high-powered Chinasat 8 orbiter is to begin providing video, data and digital services from 1999, with 16 Ku-band channels at 125 watts per channel and 36 C-band channels at 37 watts each allowing communications coverage to all of China.</p>
<p>"The package is about $200 million and our portion of that is $100 million," Stackpole said of the contract. "It is the most powerful satellite that China has purchased so far."</p>
<p>Chinasat 8 would have a mission life of 15 years, Loral said.</p>
<p>Chinasat, which is controlled by China's Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, has not announced its choice of a launcher for Chinasat 8, nor has it released its business plan for the satellite, Stackpole said.</p>
<p>Loral's stock rose 25 cents to $15.75 on the New York Stock Exchange in late trading.</p>
