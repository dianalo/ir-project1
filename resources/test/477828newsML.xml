<headline>Israel begins destroying Arab bomber's home.</headline>
<dateline>SURIF, West Bank 1997-03-31</dateline>

<p>Israel began on Monday demolishing the West Bank home of a Palestinian suicide bomber who killed three Israelis in a Tel Aviv cafe 10 days ago, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said the Israeli army imposed a curfew on the village of Surif near Jerusalem as a bulldozer began destroying the second floor of the house in which the 28-year-old bomber Mousa Ghneimat, his wife and four children lived.  </p>
<p>The demolition came one day after Israel's High Court rejected an appeal by the Ghneimat family against the destruction, which Palestinians and rights groups view as collective punishment. Judges said the measure was a legitimate form of deterrence.</p>
<p>Israeli courts have rarely barred military authorities from carrying out demolitions.</p>
<p>The suicide bombing came on the backdrop of Palestinian outrage at Israel's ground-reaking of a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>A caller told Israeli police the Islamic militant Hamas group ordered the attack in reprisal for the construction which Palestinians say aims to cut off Arab East Jerusalem from other parts of the West Bank.</p>
