<p>Zimbabwe's key industrial index closed weaker for the third week running on Friday, brokers said.</p>
<p>But Zimbabwe Stock Exchange Chief Executive Antony Barfoot said the market was likely to take heart from the central Reserve Bank's reversal of a requirement barring the transfer of shares from foreign registers to the local market without clearance.</p>
<p>"The Reserve Bank has gone back to the original position and this will be particularly welcomed by foreign investors who felt the Reserve Bank was interfering in their trading," Barfoot said.</p>
<p>On Friday the industrial index dropped 100.54 points or 0.98 percent, precipitated in part by declines in Meikles down 200 cents to 2,700 and bankers NMB off by 100 to 3,300. It lost 193.94 points or 1.9 percent during the week, as investors reacted to firming interest rates and a higher inflationary figure of 22.4 percent in the year to April.</p>
<p>Other counters to lose were bankers Barclays which lost 100 cents to 2,800 and timber merchants Border which shed 50 cents to 1,600 while drug manufacturers CAPS added 200 cents to 2,300. Clothing chain Edgars and hoteliers Zimsun both added 20 cents to 720 and 400 respectively.</p>
<p>The secondary mining index rose 6.88 or 0.68 percent to 1,013.09 on the back of firmer deals in Falgold, up 10 cents to 60 and Ashanti which added 500 to 1,150 cents. The index added 10.56 points or 1.1 percent during the week.</p>
