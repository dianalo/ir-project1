<p>The ONS said the 0.4 percent rise in manufacturing output between May and June reflected increases in the engineering, metals and food sectors.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 1997 around half of the manufacturing industries had shown decreases in production compared to the previous quarter.  </p>
<p>There were decreases of 1.8 percent in the output of the machinery and equipment industries, 1.0 percent in textile, leather and clothing industries and 0.7 percent in the output of the chemical industries. There were, however, increases of 2.0 percent in the output on non-metallic mineral products, 0.9 percent in the transport equipment industries and 0.5 percent in the output of the electrical and optical equipment industries.</p>
<p>*First quarterly fall since June 1996, when 0.2 percent fall</p>
