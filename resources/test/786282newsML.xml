<p>Annual growth in British retail sales eased slightly in July and is expected to continue at a broadly similar rate in August, the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Its July distributive trades survey showed a positive balance of 35 percent of retailers, wholesalers and motor traders reporting increased volumes compared with 39 percent in June. The CBI said 37 percent of retailers had expected an increase.  </p>
<p>"The growth in retail trade eased a little in July, but underlying sales growth continues to be relatively stable," said Sudhir Junankar, the CBI's associate director of economic analysis."</p>
<p>He said business sectors related to the booming housing market had done particularly well, probably helped by consumers spending some of the "windfall" gains millions have received as building societies turn themselves into banks.</p>
<p>"However, the survey clearly points to further steady sales growth in August, suggesting that upward momentum in consumer demand remains firmly under control," Junankar added.</p>
<p>The Bank of England's monetary policy committee, which has expressed concern about strong personal consumption, was meeting on Thursday to decide whether to raise interest rates from their present 6.75 percent level. An announcement was due at 1100 GMT.</p>
