<p>Canadian broadcaster WIC Western International Communications Ltd. faced a tide of shareholder discontent at its annual meeting on Wednesday as a dissident motion to liquidate the company won widespread support.</p>
<p>Almost 57 percent of the company's Class B shareholders voted for the proposal in a symbolic gesture of protest, a high level for shareholder-initiated motions. But it was doomed to fail because the two families that control WIC's Class A shares voted against it.</p>
<p>The motion by New York investment firm Oppenheimer &amp; Co. required two-thirds approval by both A and B shareholders.</p>
<p>But WIC, which owns eight television, 12 radio stations and a share of Canada's CTV television network, made a concession to the dissident group by agreeing to consider adding an independent director to its 13-member board.</p>
<p>The company, which defeated a hostile takeover bid by rival CanWest Global Communications Corp. a year ago, has been beset by controversy over lackluster performance and a two-tier share structure.</p>
<p>That structure allows the Griffiths family of Vancouver to control the company by owning most of its voting Class A shares, although it holds only seven percent of WIC's total equity. The Class B shareholders normally do not have voting rights except in certain rare circumstances.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer representative Eric Rosenfeld called that system "an anachronism." There has been profound disrespect for minority shareholders," he told the meeting.</p>
<p>WIC also said on Wednesday that earnings in its first quarter ended November 30 rose to C$8.3 million ($6.1 million) from C$7.9 million ($5.9 million) a year earlier, while revenues rose to C$129.6 million ($96 million) from C$123.2 million ($91.3 million).</p>
<p>In Toronto Stock Exchange trading, WIC's B shares gained 25 Canadian cents (18.5 U.S. cents) on Wednesday to C$23 ($17.04).</p>
<p>The large vote among B shareholders for the motion to dissolve the company surprised WIC executives. Chairman Ed King did a double take when the result was announced and asked it to be re-read.</p>
<p>He denounced it as an "arcane and extreme" way for shareholders to express their dissatisfaction, but said the company took shareholders' concerns seriously.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer's Rosenfeld said the outcome showed the depth of shareholder dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>"We're very happy with the result...It should be taken as a very strong message to the company and the board to get the stock price up," he said.</p>
<p>He said WIC's offer to consider adding an independent director was not enough to appease dissidents, but he did not know what other steps, if any, his group would take. "One director is a start but we don't think it's enough," Rosenfeld said.</p>
<p>Oppenheimer had also proposed a motion to require WIC to allow all shareholders to elect three of its 13 directors, but that was also defeated by the Griffiths and Allard families who own virtually all the A shares.</p>
<p>A British Columbia court was due to hear an appeal on February 10 by CanWest of a ruling last year that blocked its takeover effort. That ruling rejected an effort to award voting rights to the Class B shares.</p>
<p>King and WIC Chief Executive John Lacey disputed Oppenheimer's claims that WIC was poorly run with an entrenched management and they defended the two-tier share structure. King said the motion to dissolve the company was "potentially disruptive" and would not have been a good way to increase shareholder value.</p>
<p>WIC said it was poised to reap the benefits of several important strategic moves, including the acquisition of a TV station in Montreal, an expanded market for its Ontario TV station and the launch of its new local multi-point communications service in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>"Our company enters 1997 with really good prospects," said Lacey.</p>
