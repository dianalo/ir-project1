<p>U.S. Agriculture Department on Friday pegged Taiwan 1996/97 soybean imports at 2.374 million tonnes, down from 2.574 million tonnes seen last month and below 2.646 million tonnes estimated in 1995/96.</p>
<p>USDA analysts said decrease was largely due to the crippling outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease among hogs on the island that has cut feed needs.</p>
<p>In its April World Supply and Demand report, USDA said rising soybean prices and the forecast reduction in soybean imports by Taiwan were expected to cut the pace of U.S. soybean exports.</p>
<p>Taiwan is a major customer for U.S. farm products and was number three buyer of U.S. corn and soybeans last year.</p>
