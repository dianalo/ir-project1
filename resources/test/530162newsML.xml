<p>Taiwan share prices are expected to consolidate on Tuesday after Monday's strong rebound but with slow, cautious turnover, brokers said.</p>
<p>But the market should gain support from a statement by deputy central bank governor Hsu Chia-tung on Monday that the central bank, which has tried to cool the island's recent stock market fever, would like to see "appropriate" growth.</p>
<p>On Monday, the index ended up 119.62 points or 1.44 percent at 8,421.87, a rebound after five straight sessions of falls.</p>
<p>A 8,350-8,500 range was seen for Tuesday.  </p>
<p>"In theory, a strong rebound with slower turnover usually will lead to selling pressure in the following day," said National Securities international sales chief Oliver Fang.</p>
<p>"But deputy governor Hsu's saying the bank is happy to see appropriate market growth should help boost sentiment," Fang said.</p>
<p>He said he expected the consolidation to continue until the end of April, and investors will likely step to the sidelines in the near term.</p>
