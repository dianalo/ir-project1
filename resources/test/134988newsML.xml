<p>Greek equities rebounded following Monday's sharp fall and closed with mild gains, off the session's high of 920.6 points. Turnover picked up to 8.34 billion drachmas, boosted by block trades in Ergobank.</p>
<p>On Monday brokers attributed the fall to a bearish market climate because of an uninspiring macro-environment, lack of cash inflows and feared tax measures with the 1997 budget next month which may hit investor pockets.</p>
<p>"On the macroeconomic front, it is quite likely to see inflation stuck above 8.0 percent until year end. This strengthens an outlook of stable interest rates and is not boosting market psychology," said analyst Emmanuel Varsos at Investment Analysis.</p>
<p>"Also the mandatory revaluation of fixed assets for listed firms could turn out an unpleasant surprise if tax rates on the capital gains rise to 5-8 percent from 1.0 percent previously," he said.</p>
<p>This could have an impact on the liquidity of banks and heavy industrials and has not been discounted by the market Investment Analysis noted in its weekly outlook.</p>
<p>The Athens general share index closed up 0.49 percent, or 4.48 points higher at 918.46 from Monday's 913.98 close with turnover rising to 8.34 billion drachmas on volume of 4.4 million shares.</p>
