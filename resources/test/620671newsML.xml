<p>Conservative President Jacques Chirac warned French voters on Wednesday that change carries risks as Socialist Party leader Lionel Jospin savoured the prospect of winning power in Sunday's parliamentary election.</p>
<p>French financial markets plunged on worries that a left-wing alliance including Socialists and Communists -- or perhaps even the Socialists alone -- would win Sunday's decisive ballot in the two-round snap election.</p>
<p>Stocks plunged by 3.63 percent, the franc fell below a key level of 3.38 per mark and bonds also closed down though above their day's lows. The Bank of France had no comment on whether it was intervening in currency markets to prop up the franc.</p>
<p>"France cannot afford to change direction all the time without taking serious risks," Chirac told the final meeting of his cabinet before the decisive vote.</p>
<p>To change horses now would lead to "confusion and weakness", the Gaullist head of state was quoted as saying by government spokesman Alain Lamassoure.</p>
<p>He urged centre-right ministers to explain to voters that "in the next five years, France must be governed in a modern, coherent and determined way".</p>
<p>But Socialist leader Jospin, the left's candidate for prime minister, urged Chirac to brace for a period of sharing power with the left.</p>
<p>"Cohabitation", as the French call power-sharing, "shows respect for what the people have decided," Jospin told Radio Luxembourg. Later, at a rally in Muret, southern France, he warned left-wing voters against overconfidence, "even if victory seems more and more likely for us".</p>
<p>The left-wing opposition outpolled the centre-right coalition by more than four points in last Sunday's first round of voting and polling firms said it was on course for a narrow majority if the pattern were repeated in Sunday's runoff.</p>
<p>Chirac told his cabinet that the work done by outgoing Prime Minister Alain Juppe, who has announced he will resign whatever the election outcome, had enabled the country to face the next stage of its development "in good conditions".</p>
<p>An emotional Juppe later told a rally in Bordeaux, the southwestern city where he serves as mayor, that he would continue to fight for a centre-right victory.</p>
<p>"Convince your fellow citizens that Socialism would be an open road to decadence in France," he said to warm applause.</p>
<p>Seeking to lure back disenchanted voters, Chirac said in a televised message on Tuesday that he had heard their message but urged them not to return to "the socialist ideas of yesteryear".</p>
<p>Most analysts said his appeal fell short of the dramatic gesture needed to give his government a new lease on life.</p>
<p>"Is that all there is?" headlined the daily France-Soir over a picture of Chirac in a Superman costume.</p>
<p>What the president desperately needs is a friendly parliament for the final five years of his seven-year presidential term.</p>
<p>His gamble of dissolving the National Assembly, with its strong centre-right majority, and holding an election nearly 10 months early to strengthen his hand as France heads into European monetary union, has already gone badly wrong.</p>
<p>"Let us take care not to compromise everything at the moment when we are reaping the first fruits of our efforts," the Gaullist president said in his televised speech.</p>
<p>But Communist Party leader Robert Hue told Radio Monte the "fruits" consisted of "continuing unemployment, economic uncertainty, difficulties and privatisations".</p>
<p>"The French people no longer want these fruits," he said.</p>
