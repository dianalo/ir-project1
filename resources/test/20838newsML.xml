<p>Precious metals were stuck in a narrow and lower range on Thursday compared with prices earlier this week in a market which dealers described as gloomy.</p>
<p>Gold was fixed at $388.05 per ounce after $388.50 on Wednesday and a close of $388.55.</p>
<p>"Physical business is beginning to kick in but it is doing no more than mopping up any surplus," a dealer said, adding that he did not get bullish for gold until late September.</p>
<p>"I don't expect to see much before that and meanwhile the physical offtake is taking up any profit-taking from the longs (holders of gold) who bought in the rally from $381 to $389," he added.</p>
<p>Both New York and the Far East were quiet and featureless overnight with gold marginally easier in New York and regaining European closing levels in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Dealers said the precious metals would probably remain quiet this week ahead of the three-day U.S. Labor Day weekend.</p>
<p>Silver was no more exiting but dealers' and analysts' views varied on the medium-term price trend.</p>
<p>"Silver has been mixed and very difficult to figure out. Until gold starts to move I can see it sitting in a $5.15-$5.25 range," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Others were less optimistic, seeing silver losing ground after its continual failure to get over $5.25 per ounce earlier this week.</p>
<p>Platinum and palladium were also lukewarm with platinum indicated down $0.25 at $399.75 and palladium 80 cents easier at $126.20.</p>
