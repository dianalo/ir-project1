<p>Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov, stepping up the war of words against his main political rival, on Wednesday accused security chief Alexander Lebed of plotting to use force to seize power in Russia.</p>
<p>"(Lebed) has decided to move ahead using force instead of waiting for the next presidential poll," Kulikov, Lebed's bitter political opponent, told a news conference.</p>
<p>"The question is what awaits Russia if Lebed comes to power through a creeping coup."</p>
<p>Lebed quickly dismissed the allegations and said he would sue Kulikov.</p>
<p>"There can be no talk of a mutiny," Lebed told Interfax news agency. Asked to explain Kulikov's charges, Lebed replied sarcastically: "The poor thing has got everything wrong."</p>
<p>Rumours of plots and potential coups d'etat are all too frequent in Russia, alarming nervous financial markets abroad.</p>
<p>Tanks have appeared in Moscow twice in just over five years, once in August 1991 when hardliners tried to oust Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and again in October 1993 when Russian President Boris Yeltsin tried to oust a new batch of hardliners holed up in the White House government building.</p>
<p>The RIA news agency, which is usually close to the Kremlin, said Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin had summoned intelligence chiefs and Russia's defence and interior ministers to a special meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p>RIA said its sources had given no reason for the meeting and it was not clear if Lebed would attend. Chernomyrdin is in charge of coordinating the work of the so-called "power ministries" while Yeltsin prepares for heart surgery.</p>
<p>Lebed and Kulikov are involved in a fierce Kremlin power struggle which has worsened since Yeltsin revealed on September 5 that he planned to go under the knife.</p>
<p>"He (Lebed) is actively using his authority as Security Council secretary to create power structures reporting personally to him," Kulikov said.</p>
<p>"We have information that he is planning to go on vacation soon to prepare to use force on a local level," he said without giving details, adding that he had passed all details of the Lebed's activities to Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>Itar-Tass news agency, quoting Lebed's press office, said Yeltsin had not yet decided how to react to Lebed's request for two weeks leave of absence.</p>
