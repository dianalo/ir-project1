<p>Six Corsican nationalists suspected of a series of guerrilla attacks on the Mediterranean island have beeen placed under formal investigation and remanded in prison in Paris, judicial sources said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Four of them, held in a police swoop in Corsica on Monday, are suspected of planning a series of bombings between September and March, they said.</p>
<p>Two others were being held for alleged conspiracy and membership of a banned organisation.</p>
<p>The six were remanded in prison on Friday night and two other people rounded up in Monday's raids, both women, were freed on the orders of anti-terrorist judge Gilbert Thiel, the sources said.</p>
<p>A ninth person, whose house in southern Corsica had contained a major arms cache found by police, would be interviewed by the same judge later on Saturday.</p>
<p>French Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre said on Thursday that police had made their biggest ever arms seizure following the raids against suspected separatist guerrillas.</p>
<p>He told French radio nine people were initially being held on the island in Ajaccio and some had admitted responsibility in six bombings over the past six months.</p>
<p>The bombings were claimed by the hardline historic wing of the separatist Corsican National Liberation Front, which seeks greater autonomy from Paris.</p>
<p>The ministry said police had seized pistols, revolvers, sawn-off shotguns, a shrapnel hand grenade, explosives and gas containers connected to detonators.</p>
<p>As a result of the round-up, police also uncovered on Thursday another arms cache in an isolated farm building including a rocket launcher, an assault rifle, four sub-machine guns, explosives, communications equipment and hoods, the trademark headgear of separatist guerrillas.</p>
<p>FLNC separatists have claimed hundreds of bombings in a campaign spanning two decades. Recent targets have included tax and post offices, bank branches and offices of state-run companies France-Telecom and Air France.</p>
