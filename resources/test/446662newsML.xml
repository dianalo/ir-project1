<p>(Corrects month in headline from February to January).</p>
<p>Yugoslavia's M1 money supply fell 4.9 percent in January to 5.233 billion dinars ($929 million), the Institute for Market Research (IZIT) said on Monday in a report based on the central bank's latest figures.</p>
<p>This compared to 5.5 billion dinars at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>"Shrinking M1 was expected because it was necessary to halt the tumbling dinar from falling any further," IZIT's economist Slobodan Milosavljevic told Reuters.</p>
<p>A strong 10 percent monetary expansion late in December pushed the dinar down to as low as 4.3 to the German mark during eight days of New Year and Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>The dinar was changing hands at 3.9 to the mark ahead of the holidays.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia's government and the central bank vowed late last year to keep the dinar stable at 3.3 to the mark. It was fixed at 3.3 after a 70 percent devaluation in November 1995. Until then it had been fixed to the mark at par.</p>
<p>The share of cash in circulation fell to 2.523 billion dinars or 48.2 percent of M1 in January from 53.7 percent in December.</p>
<p>But deposits grew only 2.2 percent to 2.71 billion dinars in January, the report said.</p>
<p>The latest IZIT's survey showed M1 share in the country's gross domestic product (GDP) oscilated between five and eight percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Economists said M1-to-GDP ratio needed to grow further, but only gradually and to be accompanied with more financial rigour and an overall bank rehabilitation programme. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
