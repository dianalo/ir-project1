<p>Egypt said on Saturday it refused to help the Sudanese government against attacks in the east of the country because they were an internal matter.</p>
<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, in his first comment on Sudanese events since the army came under attack in the Blue Nile and Kassala areas last Sunday, said Sudan had asked him for financial and military help against the offensive.</p>
<p>The Sudanese government says Ethiopian and Eritrean troops are doing the fighting but the Sudanese opposition in exile says its rebel forces are responsible for the attacks.</p>
<p>Mubarak, at a meeting with intellectuals, was asked about his talks in Cairo on Thursday with Sudanese Vice-President al-Zubeir Mohammad Saleh and said: "I gave him some tough talk, politely".</p>
<p>"How can I support them when they are squabbling with the Sudanese people and there are Sudanese in opposition?" he added. "How can Egypt intervene and hit the Sudanese?"</p>
<p>"The truth is there is no Eritrean or Ethiopian attack or any foreign attack. We have asked and we're sure of that. No one has entered Sudanese territory," he added.</p>
<p>Even Saleh, who spent two days in Cairo this week, had told him that Ethiopian and Eritrean forces were operating from outside Sudan, he said.</p>
<p>Mubarak ridiculed contradictory behaviour by Sudanese leaders. "There is in Sudan a split in the positions of the leadership. The vice-president is here to make up and the other one (Islamist leader Hassan al-Turabi) is insulting us in the papers at the same time," he said.</p>
<p>In all its public statements, the Sudanese government has blamed mainly the two neighbouring states, reducing the rebels to the subsidiary role of agents or mercenaries.</p>
<p>But Turabi, the speaker of parliament, told Reuters this week that Saleh wanted to ask Egypt about its policy towards the northern opposition groups which are based in Cairo and which say they are running the military campaign in the east.</p>
<p>Despite its deep reservations about the Sudanese government, Egypt has never given its whole-hearted support to the Sudanese opposition in exile, opposition leaders say.</p>
<p>Cairo is worried that a secessionist state in southern Sudan might complicate access to Nile waters. It also has a difficult relationship with the largest northern opposition group, the Umma Party, which opposed union with Egypt in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Mubarak implied that the breadth of the opposition coalition made it impossible for Egypt to support the government.</p>
<p>"It's not just a question of (veteran southern rebel John) Garang. There is the Unionists and the Umma Party and others. I have heard from Garang more than once that he does not want to partition Sudan, unlike Turabi," he said.</p>
<p>On his return to Khartoum, Saleh said Egypt supported the unity of Sudan and was helping Khartoum to maintain its unity.</p>
<p>"What is happening in the Sudanese scene was clear to the Egyptian authorities and the two countries held identical views," Saleh added.</p>
<p>Two other Arab countries, Iraq and Jordan, have adopted the Sudanese view of events.</p>
<p>Jordan on Friday urged Arab states to come to Sudan's aid, saying it faced a plot against its territorial unity.</p>
<p>"What brotherly Sudan is being exposed to is a conspiracy aimed at the unity of its people and territory and this is a matter that necessitates from Arab countries a united stance," Prime Minister Abdul Karim al-Kabariti was quoted as saying in remarks in local newspapers.</p>
