<headline>Thomson-CSF slips, market eyes sale terms.</headline>

<p>Shares in French defence electronics firm Thomson-CSF eased 0.62 percent to 191.80 francs at 0932 GMT, after the group posted a return to profit with a 1996 net attributable gain of 745 million francs.</p>
<p>"The operating profit is in line with expectations," said a dealer. Net attributable profit was lower than the some one billion francs some had been expecting because the company had loaded the accounts with restructuring charges, which was viewed as a "good thing", he added.</p>
<p>But the market was not looking so much at the 1996 results as the prospects for Thomson's acquisition, he said.  </p>
<p>The market was down 0.55 percent at 0956 GMT. Market operators want to know whether Alcatel Alsthom or Lagardere Groupe will win the bidding for Thomson-CSF.</p>
<p>The rival bidders are expected to pay a premium to gain control of Thomson-CSF, which will please minority shareholders, traders said.</p>
<p>French newspapers have reported the terms and conditions of the Thomson-CSF sale are expected to be sent to the Privatisation Commission later this week or early next week.</p>
<p>Thomson-CSF is holding an analysts meeting this afternoon from 1400 GMT.</p>
