<p>Confirmation that U.S. processors are turning to Brazil to buy soybeans prompted a sharp selloff in Chicago futures on Wednesday but the imports are unlikely to have a long-term price impact, analysts said.</p>
<p>"It's going to be negative for the cash market for a while because it takes away some premium," said Dale Durchholz, grain analyst with Agrivisor Services in Bloomington, Ill. "But total world consumption is still strong," he said.</p>
<p>U.S. soybean stockpiles are at the lowest levels in 20 years due to booming exports, and prices this spring have climbed to levels not seen since a Midwestern drought in 1988.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, citing the tight U.S. soybean supplies, Minneapolis-based grain giant Cargill Inc issued a carefully worded statement confirming it had contracted to purchase an unspecified quantity of Brazilian soybeans.</p>
<p>"To carry us through this period, Cargill and other companies have turned to the global market for additional supplies," the company said.</p>
<p>Grain imports into the United States, the top grain exporter, remain a touchy issue with American farmers, since the purchases benefit competing overseas farmers and pressure U.S. farm prices.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Owensboro Grain, a small crusher in Kentucky, bought several cargos of soybeans from Brazil but later cancelled at least one cargo.</p>
<p>In January 1985, Cargill shocked U.S. farm circles by announcing a plan to import 25,000 tonnes of Argentine wheat to supply flour millers on the U.S. Gulf Coast at a time of high domestic wheat prices.</p>
<p>Cargill soon withdrew the plan but it prompted U.S. Senate hearings to discuss U.S. grain competitiveness a month later.</p>
<p>Brazil is currently the number one competitor for the United States in selling soybeans to world markets.</p>
<p>"You'll hear some grumbling and you'll hear it talked about around the coffee table," Durchholz said of the Brazilian imports. "But it's all about making money and they (farmers) understand that."</p>
<p>Soybeans for July delivery at the Chicago Board of Trade closed down the 30-cent-per-bushel daily limit at $8.30 on Wednesday. That was down from a high of $8.86 last Friday before rumours of soybean imports began to circulate.</p>
<p>Cargill said it would use the soybeans to supply its plants in the U.S. Southeast, which provide soymeal and other feeds to livestock and poultry producers.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, the Brazilian processor Ceval Alimentos said it was negotiating a sale of 40,000 metric tons of soymeal for shipment to the United States. Traders said the buyer was likely a large pork producer on the East Coast.</p>
<p>That news helped send July soymeal at the exchange down the $10 a ton daily limit to close at $273.10 a ton.</p>
<p>Durchholz said news of Brazilian soy imports should not come as a surprise because U.S. commercial firms began to look at Brazil as a cheaper source of soybeans as soon as that country began actively harvesting in March.</p>
<p>Despite the sharp drop in Chicago prices Wednesday, the market is supported long term by strong world demand, he said.</p>
<p>"The fact is, that exports are still okay for this time of year. We're crushing more than we did recently and the overall off-take in the world is still quite good," Durchholz said.</p>
<p>Traders said the psychological impact of Brazilian imports this year was muted by the switch to a more market-based farm economy in the U.S. and by historically low soybean stocks.</p>
<p>Big imports also aren't expected because shipping soybeans from Brazil only works out financially for soybean processors that have plants located near major U.S. ports, analysts said.</p>
