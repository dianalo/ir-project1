<p>The number of cellular phones worldwide will grow to 200 million by 2000, from 88 million at the end of 1996, a senior official of Nokia Telecommuncations, a unit of Finland's Nokia AB Oy, said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The use of mobile phones is fast replacing that of wireline phones, and over the next several years, wireless phones will overtake fixed line phones," Mika P. Vehvilainen, senior vice president at Nokia Telecommunications told a press conference.</p>
<p>He said the driving force in wireless telecommunications was wireless data, which in turn was being driven by the internet.</p>
<p>According to estimates by Nokia, data will account for 50 percent of all wireless traffic by 2000, up from about 10 percent today.</p>
<p>"As the need for people to be more mobile grows, so will the need for mobile data. This has already happened in several Scandinavian and European countries, and the trends are beginning to show in Asia," Janne Jormalainen, general manager, wireless data, Nokia Mobile Phones (SEA) Pte Ltd said.</p>
<p>He said in Asia wireless data would become a force over the next several years. At present, data accounted for less than five percent of wireless traffic in developed markets such as Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and Australia.</p>
<p>In India, network operators had already provided the service, he said, and that Nokia was looking at ways to promote wireless data.</p>
<p>"We have seen the penetration of cutting-edge telecom products is much faster in several Asian countries that do not have a conventional telecom base."</p>
<p>Jormalainen stated Nokia's big push for wireless data in India would start in 1998, when India would have in the region of 700,000 wireless phones.</p>
