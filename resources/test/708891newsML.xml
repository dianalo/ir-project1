<p>Veteran Chinese dissident Zhang Lin, recently released from a labour camp after finishing a three-year sentence, said on Saturday that his parents had been severely beaten by police informers.</p>
<p>Two neighbours of Zhang Lin's parents had beaten the elderly couple up on Friday evening after Zhang's mother quarreled with them for spying on the family since Zhang's release from prison last month, Zhang said by telephone.</p>
<p>"My father had three front teeth knocked out and my mother suffered serious head injuries and has several lumps the size of eggs," Zhang said from his home in Bengbu city in central Anhui province.</p>
<p>Zhang's mother, 58, was being treated for her injuries in hospital, he said.</p>
<p>"The assailants were people who have supplied information to the police about me and my family," he said.</p>
<p>Zhang had applied with the Public Security Bureau to hold a public demonstration protesting police inaction towards the case after police did nothing after he reported the beatings, he said.</p>
<p>"They rejected my application first because they said I had no identification... and they warned me not to act rashly," he said. Police were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Zhang was released from three years of re-education through labour on June 1, having been arrested in 1994 for not having his marriage licence in order. Police also accused him of having too many contacts with foreign reporters.</p>
<p>Zhang played a leading role in 1989 pro-democracy protests in Anhui that mirrored those held in Beijing's Tiananmen Square and later served two years in prison.</p>
