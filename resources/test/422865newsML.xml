<p>A mention by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan of a previously obscure statistic known as "voluntary job leavers" has put a spotlight on the number, but a government statistician on Thursday cautioned against reading too much into it.</p>
<p>"This is not a measure of people quitting their jobs," said Jay Meisenheimer, economist with the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p>The bureau publishes a statistic in its monthly employment report on the percentage of unemployed Americans who have left their jobs voluntarily.</p>
<p>Some economists, including Greenspan, believe it may be an indicator of worker confidence in the job market and a possible predictor of willingness to demand wage increases.</p>
<p>The figure has been dubbed the "quit rate" by some analysts, but Meisenheimer called that a misnomer.</p>
<p>He stressed that the job leavers rate represents only a small portion of those who quit and thus has limited value as a labor-market indicator. The rate does not include people quitting to leave the workforce altogether nor does it include people leaving one job to immediately take up another one.  </p>
<p>Such job-hopping would be a useful gauge, Meisenheimer said, but the Labor Department does not measure it.</p>
<p>"I suspect there are a lot more people who quit their jobs and immediately take others than those who leave and don't have a job lined up," he said.</p>
<p>"If people are interested in wage pressures, if we had a measure of people leaving to take other jobs rather those leaving to become unemployed, it would be much more useful," Meisenheimer added.</p>
<p>Job leavers as a percentage of the unemployed jumped in January to 12.3 from 11.7 percent in December -- a fact highlighted by Greenspan in his semiannual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress.</p>
<p>The Fed chief said the increase may be a sign of an end to an unusual period of worker insecurity that has helped keep a lid on wage demands.</p>
<p>Fearing that signs of growing wage pressures may prompt the Fed to raise interest rates, U.S. financial markets will be looking to see if a further rise in job leavers shows up in the February employment report, which is due out Friday at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time (1330 GMT).</p>
<p>Financial market traders are not the only ones to take an interest in the job leavers number.  </p>
<p>Last week, Sen. Connie Mack, vice chairman of Congress' Joint Economic Committee, released a report suggesting a link between the job leavers statistic and inflation.</p>
<p>For his part, Meisenheimer saw little correlation between movements in the rate and developments in the business cycle.</p>
<p>"It's all over the map," he said. "I see high numbers and low numbers at all sorts of different periods in the business cycle."</p>
<p>During the 1981-82 recession, for example, he noted the job leavers rate was hovering near levels where it is now and that in January 1991, in the midst of the last recession, the rate registered 12.7 percent -- higher than this past January.</p>
<p>Explaining how the job leavers statistic has figured into the Fed's thinking, Richmond Fed President Alfred Broaddus on Wednesday described it as "one piece of information" along with many others that the central bank watches.</p>
<p>"I don't think you can draw any firm conclusions from it," he added.</p>
