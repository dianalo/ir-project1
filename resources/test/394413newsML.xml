<title>FRANCE: Euro Disney boss to head Club Med.</title>

<p>Resort company Club Mediterranee on Friday named Philippe Bourguignon, the chairman who turned Euro Disney into a moneymaking success, as its new chairman.</p>
<p>Club Med, which pioneered the concept of all-inclusive vacations at friendly "villages," said it would report a loss of 743 million francs ($130 million) for the year ending Oct. 31, 1996, after taking 820 million francs ($144.3 million) in restructuring charges.</p>
<p>Club Med said in October that weak vacation spending would hurt its results, but analysts were still predicting a profit for 1995-96. Club Med earned 169 million francs ($29.7 million) in the previous year.</p>
<p>Despite the weak spending climate in France that has plagued the leisure industry, Bourguignon turned Disneyland Paris into a top tourist draw which has made money for two consecutive years after running up huge losses since it opened in 1992.</p>
<p>He replaces Chairman Serge Trigano, the son of Club Med co-founder Gilbert Trigano. Trigano has been asked to head the company's supervisory board in what appears to be a face-saving gesture.</p>
<p>Club Med said in a statement that the results of the summer season marked a break in the recovery trend seen since 1993, when Club Med reported its first annual loss amid concerns that its "sun and surf" resorts may be falling out of fashion.</p>
<p>"The inadequate results reflected tougher market conditions than those foreseen in Club Med's plans up to now," the company said, adding that competition and pressure on profit margins had risen sharply in Europe, its main market.</p>
<p>The trend in Europe is toward shorter vacations with little advance planning.</p>
<p>Euro Disney, operator of the Disneyland Paris theme park, said President and Chief Operating Officer Gilles Pelisson would succeed Bourguignon. The Walt Disney Co owns 39 percent of Euro Disney.</p>
