<p>Swedish shipping group Gorthon Lines said on Friday it aimed to more than double its profits in the coming three to five years and targeted a return on capital employed of 15 percent annually.</p>
<p>"We more than doubled the profit in the past five years. We hope to increase that figure much more," Gorthon chief executive Mats Nilsson told Reuters in connection with an analyst meeting.</p>
<p>The company will expand through both acquisitions and organic growth, Nilsson said.</p>
<p>The group ships forestry products and Nilsson saw an upturn in forestry trends in 1998 and 1999.</p>
<p>Gorthon Lines will probably order two new ships, with an option for another two, for the North Atlantic in 1997, Nilsson said, adding that the cost for two new ships amounted to 700-800 million crowns.</p>
<p>But Nilsson found it unlikely that the group with its current structure would expand its 18-ship fleet to more than 25 ships.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he did not see the company increasing its 25 percent market share to more than 50 percent.</p>
<p>In 1997, Gorthon Lines plans to dock four ships at a cost of between two million and 3.5 million crowns a ship and in 1998 between six and eight ships will be docked. Last year the docking of eight ships cost 15-20 million crowns.</p>
