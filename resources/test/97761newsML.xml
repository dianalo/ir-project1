<p>China accused Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten on Friday of trying to sabotage the smooth handover of the British colony to Beijing, but treated his remarks as almost irrelevant with just nine months left of British rule.</p>
<p>The commentary by the official Xinhua news agency charged Patten, who delivered his swan-song annual policy speech in Hong Kong on Wednesday, of trying to perpetuate colonial rule beyond the July 1, 1997 handover and of seeking to influence the government of his successors.</p>
<p>China's Foreign Ministry chose to ignore all of Patten's speech apart from his opposition to Beijing's decision to scrap the territory's Legislative Council and his demand that the council should complete its full four-year term.</p>
<p>"We believe this issue has already been settled and no further remarks should be delivered that are not conducive to bilateral cooperation," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>Diplomats said China appeared anxious to avoid allowing a row over remarks by Patten, whom Beijing already regards as a lame duck with just months remaining to the handover, to jeopardise a warming in ties with Britain over the last year.</p>
<p>"With only nine months to go before Hong Kong's return to the motherland, Sino-British relations are progressing to the direction of continuous improvement," Xinhua said.</p>
<p>China has said it will dismantle the existing legislature when it resumes sovereignty at midnight on June 30, 1997, and allow a hand-picked provisional legislature to take over.</p>
<p>"From (Patten's) address, his attempt is obviously exposed -- the smooth transition is not his only aim, and all he needs is a successful transition, which tries to extend the colonial rule beyond 1997 and influence the operation of the SAR (Special Administrative Region) government," Xinhua said.</p>
<p>"To people's indignation, the address made much criticism and maliciously attacked the people who love the motherland and Hong Kong," Xinhua said.</p>
<p>Patten said allowing the provisional legislature to operate before next July 1 would be unnecessarily provocative, and could lead to legal challenges in court.</p>
<p>The issue has been at the heart of bitter quarrels betwen Britain and China in recent years in the course of negotiations on handover details, although relations have thawed lately.</p>
<p>The Xinhua commentary charged Patten was repeating old errors that could only harm Hong Kong.</p>
<p>"After four years, he not only failed to examine his mistakes, but tried to seek every possible means to defend himself," Xinhua said.</p>
<p>China accuses Britain of overstepping a 1984 handover deal through electoral reforms introduced by Patten after he arrived in 1992. Britain sees China's views to scrap the Legco and to install an appointed legislature in a similar vein, but has avoided saying explicitly that it would be illegal.</p>
<p>"The British side should be well aware of who should be responsible for the failure of the through train arrangement," the Foreign Ministry said in a veiled reference to what it regards as Patten's interference with a smooth transition.</p>
<p>"As the policy address goes against the wishes of the Hong Kong people, and is widely divergent from the British government's repeated expression of restoring and developing the Sino-British cooperative relations, it has once again aroused new disputes in Hong Kong," Xinhua said.</p>
<p>"In the final and critical stage of the transitional period, increasing cooperation between China and Britain and guaranteeing a smooth transition has become the common aspiration of all the Hong Kong residents," it said.</p>
