<p>Smokers and people in southern tobacco states by large margins approve of the new restrictions on youths and tobacco, according to a poll released by an anti-tobacco group Thursday.</p>
<p>The group, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, also unveiled newspaper advertisements urging politicians to support the new Food and Drug Administration rules.</p>
<p>Backed by organisations including the American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association and the PTA, the ads will appear starting Friday.</p>
<p>The poll of 1,006 adults found that 85 percent of Americans agreed with the FDA policies aimed at curtailing youth access to tobacco and advertising aimed at teenagers.</p>
<p>It found that 83 percent of Southerners, whose regional economies are more dependant than the rest of the country on the tobacco industry, and nearly 82 percent of smokers agreed with the FDA.</p>
<p>"Support for the new FDA regulations is uniformly strong across all age, education, income, racial and regional segments," said William Novelli, president of the campaign.</p>
<p>"This poll shows that when it comes to protecting the health of young people, Americans want the federal government to take a leadership role," he added. "When it's a matter of life and death, people trust Uncle Sam, not the Marlboro Man."</p>
<p>The FDA rule bans outdoor advertising within 1,000 feet of schools and playgrounds, permits only black-and-white text ads in publications with significant readership under age 18, prohibits the sale or giveaway of such promotional materials as caps and gym bags with cigarette brand logos and bars brand name sponsorship of athletic or entertainment events.</p>
<p>It also requires proof of age for cigarette sales and limits vending machines to places like bars and nightclubs that are inaccessible to minors.</p>
<p>The poll found public support for each of those measures.</p>
<p>Taken last week by the Bruskin/Goldring research firm, the poll had a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points.</p>
