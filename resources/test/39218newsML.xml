<p>The Taiwan dollar closed unchanged against its U.S. counterpart on Saturday in slow trade, and dealers said they expected stable trade next week.</p>
<p>The local unit ended at T$27.491, the same as Friday's close. Turnover was a slow US$41 million.</p>
<p>Dealers noted balanced supply and demand for U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>"U.S. dollar supply and demand was quite balanced, and there is no major factor expected to influence next week's movement," said one dealer. Dealers said they did not see active inflows of foreign funds. A T$27.45-27.55 range was seen for next week.</p>
