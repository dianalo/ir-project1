<p>South Africa's official Bank rate is unlikely to increase immediately despite ongoing liquidity pressure in the money market where short-term rates continued their upward momentum on Thursday, economists said.</p>
<p>Money market conditions remained exceptionally tight, squeezing banks' margins, and dealers reiterated that there would be little relief until around the middle of January when the Christmas season was over.</p>
<p>But despite the crunch economists said Reserve Bank governor Chris Stals was likely to sit it out for now, holding the Bank rate at 16 percent pending further signals on money supply and the balance of payments.</p>
<p>Much would depend October money supply and bank credit growth figures due at the end of this month, and third quarter current account data due in the next Reserve Bank Quarterly Bulletin due on December 5.</p>
<p>South Africa's daily money market shortage dipped slightly to 9.677 billion rand on Wednesday from 9.810 billion on Tuesday -- but remained expeceptionally high for mid-month.</p>
<p>Commercial banks lifted their three-month NCD rates to between 16.95 and 17.15 percent from 16.85 and 17.10 percent on Wednesday, while the 90-day BA rate was hiked to 16.35 to 16.50 from 16.25 to 16.45 percent.</p>
<p>BOE Natwest economist Nick Barnardt said market rates pointed to a rate hike but he did not seeing it happening before the end of November, if at all.</p>
<p>"The entire structure of interest rates from call rates right through to long bonds are all above the Bank rate now and that is what Stals normally watches," he said.</p>
<p>In addition, weakness in the rand over the past month had increased inflationary risks and Stals would possibly want to counter these with a tighter monetary policy.</p>
<p>"On the other hand there are signs of a slowdown in the underlying levels of bank credit over the last months and the current account seems to be turning," Barnardt said.</p>
<p>"There's no easy answer...the only one I can give is to say there is a 50/50 percent chance (of a rate hike) at the end of November or early December...it's very finely balanced."</p>
<p>Other economists agreed that money and credit data due later this month were key indicators to watch.</p>
<p>"I would say there is a very low probability of the Reserve Bank hiking bank rate at this stage...the only reason Stals would hike bank rate is if money supply and private credit remain very high over the next two months," said Herman van Papendorp of SMK Securities.</p>
<p>Equisec economist Dawie Roodt said the pressure for a rate hike would ease in the new year and there was a good chance the market could escape a pre-Christmas hike.</p>
<p>"I see lower credit growth next year which is another reason not to increase rates," Roodt said.</p>
<p>Stals warned last week that the latest fall in the rand was likely to push inflation higher, demanding a continued restrictive monetary policy.</p>
<p>He said future monetary policy would depend on developments in domestic economic conditions, such as the growth in domestic expenditure, money supply and bank credit.</p>
<p>Money market traders said it was unlikely that banks would move unilaterally to raise rates as they did in May this year without the official lead from the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>"They need to take into account the political risk attached and the flack that they came in for the last time...on that score I think the banks are very reluctant to move, hoping that money market conditions will improve," one trader said.</p>
<p>South African banks' prime lending rate currently stands at 19.25 percent.</p>
