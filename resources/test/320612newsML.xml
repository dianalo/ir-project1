<p>New York precious metals futures gave back early gains to end mostly lower Tuesday, as the US dollar remained firm and US equity markets saw new record highs.</p>
<p>"Precious metals still look mostly oversold but still refuse to bounce much and it was a sloppy close," said Anthony Raia of Linnco Futures Group in Chicago.</p>
<p>US Federal Reserve chairman Greenspan gave Congress an upbeat assessment of the US economy, allowing US bond markets to recover ground and the stock market to push higher, meaning paper assets retained their attraction, analysts said.  </p>
<p>COMEX February gold saw a session high at $356.30 early, but ended down 80 cents at $353.80, not far from the contract low at $352.60 seen on January 15. Total estimated gold futures volume was a high 48,000 lots.</p>
<p>Spot gold in the bullion market ended quoted $352.70/20, compared to the London Tuesday afternoon fix at $354.70 and the New York close Monday at $353.30/80.</p>
<p>"While prices continue to hold above key support at $350, renewed short selling cannot be ruled out in this highly technical trading environment," CPM Group analyst Edward Kempf said.  </p>
<p>Spot gold slid to three year lows at $352 an ounce in mid-January, after news of a 300 tonne gold sale by the Dutch central bank.</p>
<p>But some fund shortcovering and rolling of positions into forward contracts has allowed gold futures prices to consolidate in the past few days, traders said.</p>
<p>As a result the COMEX February/April gold spread has narrowed in recent days to $1.60 an ounce, but the spread ended slightly wider at $1.90 Tuesday, as outright prices weakened again.</p>
<p>Open interest in COMEX February gold fell 4,083 lots Monday, in data released early Tuesday, while open interest in April gold rose 3,912 lots, and total gold open interest rose 81 lots to 202,191 contracts.</p>
<p>Gold prices are now down to a level that may mean some gold producers are struggling to break even, analsyts noted.</p>
<p>"The next big source of selling is expected to come from the still very under-hedged South African producers," Merrill Lynch analyst Ted Arnold said.</p>
<p>"There are 10 mines in South Africa at present with working costs of at least $350 an ounce and four with costs of over $380 an ounce," he said.</p>
<p>South African producers have escaped some of the impact of the gold price fall in the past year due to the depreciation in the South African rand, but the rand has now stablized and gold prices in rand terms have fallen to three month lows recently, analysts noted.</p>
<p>Silver has remained relatively stronger than gold in recent weeks, as the spot gold/silver index has slide to four month lows at 74.48 Monday, before closing marginally firmer Tuesday at 74.88.</p>
<p>COMEX March silver ended down 1.7 cent at $4.715 an ounce, after seeing a session high at $4.790.</p>
<p>NYMEX April platinum closed up 10 cents at $361.50, but off its morning high at $363.40, while NYMEX March palladium ended off 45 cents at $123.55.</p>
