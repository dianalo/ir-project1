<p>World oil markets fell sharply on Monday on news that Iraq had moved a clear step nearer to resuming oil sales.</p>
<p>Brent crude oil, the world benchmark, ended Monday down 27 cents at $17.82 a barrel after peaking at $18.45 earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The United Nations said on Monday it had finalised talks with Iraq on a food distribution plan.</p>
<p>The lack of a food distribution scheme had been holding up the renewal of an "oil-for-food" deal between Iraq and the United Nations.</p>
<p>The accord allows Iraq to sell some $2.14 billion worth of oil every 180 days in exchange for food and humanitarian aid. The deal began on December 10 and ran initially for 180 days. It was renewed from June 8 but has been stalled pending receipt of the new distribution plan.</p>
<p>Iraq's oil minister said two weeks ago that he expected oil exports to begin at a rate of around 740,000 barrels per day (bpd).</p>
<p>Exports are likely to resume early in August, traders said. Due to lower oil prices and a delay in the resumption of oil sales, export flows may average up to one million bpd in the 180 days from June 8 compared to an average of just 670,000 bpd in the first period.</p>
<p>"It's almost certain to go lower in the short term," said an oil trader at Bankers Trust International in London.</p>
<p>Although the immediate downward reaction to the Iraqi news was modest, traders saw the chance of another downward push when Iraqi oil actually hits the market.</p>
<p>"Some of the news was already priced into the market but the market will have to take notice of the oil when it actually gets sold," said another trader.</p>
<p>The return of Iraqi exports will "put renewed downward pressure on crude prices in the coming weeks," Salomon Brothers said in a recent report.</p>
<p>Also putting downward pressure on prices was Germany's plan to sell 2.8 million barrels of crude oil from stocks starting in the week beginning August 4.</p>
<p>Germany's exports, approved by a cabinet meeting in Bonn on Friday, are likely to amount to less than a 10th of the flow of Iraq oil.</p>
<p>Germany this year wants to sell $230 million worth of oil, stockpiled since the late 1970's, to help meet tough financial targets for entry to a single European currency.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency added to the bearish mood last week, saying that over the rest of the year, oil markets were "expected to soften appreciably".</p>
<p>There is also likely to be pressure on the market from increasing oil production from other areas of the world, notably the North Sea.</p>
<p>Leading upstream consultants Wood MacKenzie see  British North Sea oil output rising by about 300,000 bpd from the third quarter to the fourth.</p>
<p>But despite the bearish outlook towards the end of the year, some dealers believe the short-term picture is more balanced.</p>
<p>North Sea output is expected to drop in August due to oil field maintenance and both Saudi Arabia and Nigeria have hiked prices to Western customers for next month.</p>
