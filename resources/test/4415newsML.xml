<p>Austrian oil and chemicals group OMV said on Tuesday it would continue to reduce its cost base over the next few years and aimed to cut its workforce by around four percent annually.</p>
<p>OMV employed 8,663 staff on June 30, down from 10,028 at the same time last year.</p>
<p>"We have managed to cut our workforce by around 14 percent over the past year. The bulk is behind us but we will continue with the rationalisation," director Walter Hatak told a news conference.</p>
<p>"We aim to shed five percent of (existing) staff annually while replacing one percent," he added.</p>
