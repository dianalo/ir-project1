<p>Israel on Tuesday named a commission of inquiry to probe the collapse of a stadium bridge at the opening ceremonies of an international Jewish sporting event that killed two Australians and injured 43 others.</p>
<p>Competitors from the 370-member Australian team were standing on a temporary bridge over the Yarkon River on Monday ready to lead a march into the Ramat Gan Stadium near Tel Aviv for the 51-nation Maccabiah Games when the bridge collapsed.</p>
<p>"We were walking across. All of a sudden we heard a bang," Australia team manager Harry Purcell told reporters. "And then all of a sudden in slow motion it just collapsed in the middle and we started to slide."</p>
<p>Stunned athletes in muddied white sports uniforms and green hats of the Australian delegation tumbled with the bridge's twisted scaffolding into the marshy Yarkon waters.</p>
<p>Charles Kaplan, president of the New South Wales state Jewish sports organisation, named the two dead delegation members as ten-pin bowler Greg Small, 37, and 50-year-old Yetty Bennett, section manager of the men's bowling team. Both were from Sydney.</p>
<p>"We established an investigation committee team in order to check how this bridge collapsed and who approved the plan. We want to find out why it collapsed. It shouldn't have collapsed," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters.</p>
<p>Darren Rossen, Small's friend and employee, said in an interview broadcast on Australian television that Small couldn't wait to travel to Israel to compete in the games.</p>
<p>"Certainly, if it wasn't meant to happen to anybody, it wasn't meant to happen to Greg, not this early in his life," said Rossen.</p>
<p>The quadrennial games, nicknamed the "Jewish Olympics", were postponed for a day of mourning. More than 5,500 Jewish athletes will compete in the 15th Maccabiah games.</p>
<p>Organisers dropped the march of national teams but a public storm erupted over the decision to proceed with entertainment for the 50,000 spectators present for the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>"I didn't think it was possible that on one side they were working to save lives and on the other they were dancing," Minister of Education, Culture and Sport Zevulun Hammer told Israel radio. "I felt I couldn't be there and I left."</p>
<p>While rescuers formed human chains in the muddy river, Israeli President Ezer Weizman declared the games open.</p>
<p>"I am sorry this is the way to open the Maccabiah which should be more joyous and I hope that in this Maccabiah that there will be accomplishments that will make all of us happy," he told the crowd.</p>
<p>He and Netanyahu left during the ceremony to visit wounded in Tel Aviv hospitals. Organisers said the spot decision to proceed with the entertainment came before the severity of the disaster became clear.</p>
<p>Hospital officials said on Tuesday 43 people injured in the collapse of the wood and metal bridge were still in hospital, seven with severe injuries.</p>
<p>Police launched an investigation but said there was no suspicion of foul play.</p>
<p>"I assume during the investigation...we will have to also question the people who built it," said Tel Aviv district police chief Shlomo Aronishki.</p>
<p>A wet, shoeless and shirtless Australian named Zorek, a 15-year-old tennis player, described what he said was the worst experience of his life.</p>
<p>"I was under the water. I thought I was going to die. My head was under the water. I couldn't breathe for a minute until I felt the ground."</p>
