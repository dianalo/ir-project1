<p>AUS$ S/Term range  *Support *Restnce *RSI-14 *MA-10  *MA-20</p>
<p>US$ *0.7310/0.7430 *0.7330  *0.7380  *29.63  *0.7406 *0.7457</p>
<p>--------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - July 17 ------------------</p>
<p>*Offshore range roughly US$0.7320/7375</p>
<p>*AUD staged a rare 1/2 cent bounce after critical $0.7305/10 support held solid, but capped by $0.7380 resistance so far</p>
<p>*Rally not that impressive given how oversold market is after four months of decline, and downtrend seen far from over</p>
<p>*Talk of stops atop $0.7380 may attract speculative bids and of at least one bank protecting knock out option at $0.7310  </p>
<p>By 8.15 am (2215 GMT) the dollar had flagged to US$0.7345/50 from a US$0.7375 high but was at least up on Wednesday's late US$0.7325/30 -- its lowest local close since August 1995.</p>
<p>The scale of bids at US$0.7305/10 yesterday had confirmed that as the major level to break for bears, and incidentally encouraged rumours at least one big bank was protecting a binary option position there.</p>
<p>This area marks last year's intra-day low and 73 cents is a serious Fibonacci level being a 50 percent retracement of the entire uptrend from the US$0.6420 trough in 1993 to the US$0.8210 peak in December 1996.  </p>
<p>A break below this level would suggest a 62 percent retracement was on the cards, which would take the dollar to 71 cents and see the 1995 trough of US$0.7070 tested.</p>
<p>On the topside the currency needed to clear resistance in the US$0.7440/7480 area to counter the immediate bearish pressure and would have to recover as far as US$0.7550 for the market to have any confidence a bottom had been found.</p>
<p>Such a rally looked impossible while the threat of another Reserve Bank rate cut loomed large. Some doubts had crept into other markets this weak -- largely because of the dollar's very weakness -- but the forex market was taking no chances.  </p>
<p>Many traders had been surprised by no less than three of the past four easings and vowed not to be caught long again. They were looking for a cut either next Friday following inflation and wages data or on August 6 following the RBA board meeting.</p>
<p>If the bank had not moved by then, it would be hard not to conclude the easing cycle was over and the A$ should rally.</p>
<p>The scope for a cut seemed to have grown after U.S. consumer price data showed inflation remained subdued, thus lessening the chance of a Fed hike. RBA policy is primarily determined by domestic factors but a U.S. rise would have made a cut more difficult by pressuring the A$. -- Wayne Cole 61-2 9373 1800</p>
