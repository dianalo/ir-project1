<p>Foreign exchange reserves of the Czech National Bank (CNB) edged up $30 million to $12.66 billion, according to a preliminary report published in the economic daily Hospodarske Noviny on Thursday.</p>
<p>A central bank official could not confirm the figures, but said official reserve figures would be released on Friday.</p>
<p>The central bank's reserves had dipped over the past quarter, but the paper quoted CNB spokesman Martin Svehla as saying the drop was the result of a change to the regime in which the central bank fixes the crown.</p>
<p>"The fall (over the past few months) in reserves was influenced by the departure of some short-term capital when we widened the fluctuation band for the crown," Svehla said.</p>
<p>In February 1996, the CNB widened the band within which it fixes the crown daily to +/- 7.5 percent of the midpoint of its dollar/mark basket. It used to fix crown at +/- 0.5 percent.</p>
<p>The move was taken to help introduce more currency risk in the crown, which has proved to be one of eastern Europe's most stable currencies.</p>
