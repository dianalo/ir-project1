<p>France's ruling conservatives clung to a slippery lead as polls fell silent on Sunday a week before National Assembly elections, and Socialist opposition leader Lionel Jospin said a left-wing upset was still possible.</p>
<p>The last surveys allowed to be published before the May 25-June 1 vote showed Prime Minister Alain Juppe's centre-right coalition poised for another majority -- but sharply reduced.</p>
<p>Injecting some excitement into a lacklustre campaign, the polls showed the alliance between Socialists, Communists and ecologists making up some ground and a third of voters saying they could still change their mind.</p>
<p>"Nothing is certain, and since nothing is decided this means victory is possible," Jospin told a rally in the southwestern town of Perigueux, urging voters to teach the conservatives a lesson for breaking promises to cut unemployment.</p>
<p>The surveys indicated that the right would poll fewer votes than the combined left in the first round but end up with more seats in the run-off, partly due to the vagaries of the single constituency system.</p>
<p>"What matters, given the surveys' error margins, is that there is a neck-and-neck race, an equality between the right-wing coalition and the forces of change," Jospin said.</p>
<p>The right was seen winning between 300 and 340 seats to the combined left's 210-250 in surveys of mainland France's 555 constituencies. It holds most of the other 22 overseas seats.</p>
<p>The right won 470 seats in a 1993 landslide.</p>
<p>Pitting the unpopular Juppe against the uncharismatic Jospin, the campaign focused on whether more austerity is needed to allow France to join the single European currency or whether it may be relaxed to reduce a record 12.8 percent jobless rate.</p>
<p>Gaullist outgoing National Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin, who has toned down his anti-Maastricht campaign since emerging as the voters' favourite to succeed Juppe if the right wins, said he would not renounce his ideas for the premiership.</p>
<p>He said France must join the euro since it had approved it in a 1992 referendum, but the Maastricht Treaty must be re-oriented towards the fight for jobs.</p>
<p>"That the treaty forgot about jobs is intolerable," he said.</p>
<p>Communist leader Robert Hue called President Jacques Chirac a cheat for breaking election promises on jobs and accused Juppe of concealing plans to cut tens of thousands of public sector jobs in "a frightening austerity plan".</p>
<p>The campaign has failed to shake the scepticism of voters doubtful that either side holds the keys to jobs.</p>
<p>The polling institute BVA noted that, against the usual trend, the percentage of voters undecided or uninterested in the campaign appeared to be growing as the vote approached.</p>
<p>Compounding the uncertainty, BVA said that growing numbers of supporters of Jean-Marie Le Pen's far-right National Front appeared willing to heed his advice to vote for the left in the run-off in order to trip up the conservatives.</p>
<p>Le Pen hopes that having to share power with the left could prompt President Jacques Chirac to call another snap election next year in which the National Front could be better placed.</p>
<p>While the anti-immigrant National Front is seen winning at the most a couple of seats, pollsters say its supporters are in a position to play a decisive role in the run-off.</p>
<p>While its lead slipped, the right was buoyed by a poll showing Chirac's standing sharply up to 39 percent from 31. Juppe recovered slightly to 29 percent from 27.</p>
<p>The Internet cybernetwork looked certain to make a mockery of the French legal ban on publishing any opinion poll in the week to the vote -- which means no more surveys may be disclosed as the run-off takes place a week after the first round.</p>
<p>French media said several foreign newspapers were due to order their own polls, or use those made for French political parties, and publish them on the Internet, which has some 300,000 subscribers in France.</p>
<p>Raising the curtain on the election, voters cast their ballots on Sunday in French Polynesia where the polls are held a week in advance due to organisational problems in islands scattered over a Pacific Ocean area the size of Europe.</p>
<p>The law bans disclosing results before the mainland vote.</p>
