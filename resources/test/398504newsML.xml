<p>The Indian rupee closed steady at 35.88/89 against the dollar on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>"It was an anticlimax of sorts," said a dealer. "Everyone expected the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) to be buying dollars today but they didn't."</p>
<p>Banks looking for signs of a pre-budget spurt in demand were also disappointed.</p>
<p>The leading Calcutta-based state-run bank was passive, buying dollars only from those who approached it.</p>
<p>As a result, the spot rupee, which touched a low of 35.9075 edged up to 35.8850, its highest level on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>The premia on the forward dollar continued to climb, reflecting genuine paying pressure from banks seeking to roll-over FCNR (foreign currrency non-resident) deposits.</p>
<p>"The current levels are good for payers," said the chief forex dealer at a leading bank in Bombay.</p>
<p>The fact that RBI has exhausted its positions in the forward dollar market initiated earlier this month also helped premia rise, dealers said.</p>
<p>The six month annualised premium closed at 7.47 percent, up from the earlier close of 7.13 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>Some dealers expect a mild pre-budget tension and dollar covering beginning Wednesday. The budget is scheduled to be unveiled on Friday, February 28.</p>
<p>The government's ambitious projections for capital inflows during the Ninth Plan (1997-2002) could keep the rupee slightly overvalued in the long term "as it would encourage both imports and capital flow," NatWest Securities said in a research paper.</p>
<p>It expected the rupee to depreciate by about 5.0 percent to 38.64 against the dollar by the end of 1997/98 (April-March).</p>
<p>NatWest said it expected the trade deficit to worsen to $10.22 billion in 1997/98 from an estimated $8.18 billion in 1996/97. It said the trade deficit would be lower in 1996/97 from $18.94 billion in the previous year because of a slowdown in Indian imports.</p>
<p>"But we are expecting a revival in private consumption demand during 1997 and as a result, import demand should pick up during the second quarter of 1997/98," NatWest said.</p>
