<p>Santander Investments said on Tuesday it started coverage of the Brazilian steel sector, with buy recommendations on Usiminas and Companhia Siderurgica Nacional.</p>
<p>-- Analyst Monica Carvalho said in a research note she initiated coverage of Cosipa SA and Companhia Siderurgica de Tubarao SA with market perform ratings. She said she rated Acesita as underperform.</p>
<p>-- "Usiminas is the safe play in the sector," Carvalho said. "We foresee approximately 25 percent upside from current prices, reflecting the company's strong fundamentals and possible improved sales mix."</p>
<p>-- Total steel demand in Brazil was expected to rise by about six percent in 1997, Carvalho said. The Brazilian steel sector was also characterized by low imports, she said.</p>
<p>-- Usiminas closed at 0.90 reais, Companhia Siderurgica Nacional was off 0.60 reais at 35.20 reais, Cosipa closed at 0.57 reais, Companhia Siderurgica de Tubarao SA closed at 17.80 reais and Acesita was off 0.01 reais at 2.24 reais.</p>
