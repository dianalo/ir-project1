<p>Dutch electronics group Philips Electronics said on Wednesday it would not renew its contract to sponsor the European Champions League.</p>
<p>Spokesman Ben Geerts said the company's three-year sponsorship contract was expiring this season and it would not sign a new contract starting next season.</p>
<p>"The reason is that we are reviewing our advertising mix and sponsorship is part of that budget," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>He declined to specify the value of the deal, adding that estimates of 8-10 million guilders ($4.3-5.3 million) per year mentioned in Dutch media reports were too high.</p>
<p>Geerts also denied reports that Philips was pulling out because the sponsorship package was too expensive.</p>
<p>"It's a matter of priorities," he said.</p>
<p>But he said the company would still sponsor the 1998 World Cup in France. $=Dfl1.88</p>
