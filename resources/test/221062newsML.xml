<p>The Economic Cycle Research Institute (ECRI) weekly future inflation gauge (FIG) rose to 105.3 in the week ended November 15 from 104.8 in the previous week, ECRI said.</p>
<p>Slower growth in real estate loans and a narrower yield spread between 10-year Treasury notes and three-month Treasury bills helped push the index up, ECRI said.</p>
<p>"The labor market looks about as tight as it has been in years, while the other indicators are mixed," ECRI said.</p>
<p>"As a result, the FIG remains little changed from its level six months ago," it said.</p>
