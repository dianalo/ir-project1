<p>Several Zimbabwean hospital patients have died for lack of attention as thousands of striking civil servants - mostly doctors and nurses - remained on strike for the ninth day running, the official news agency ZIANA reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>It quoted medical consultants and army medical personnel helping out senior doctors at the hospitals as saying several lives could have been saved had the nurses and doctors been at work.</p>
<p>"The situation is disastrous. I cannot work alone. I am sorry to say people are dying and their deaths could have been prevented had they received the necessary treatment and care," said a consultant at one of the major hospitals in Harare.</p>
<p>Hospital authorities and ministry of health officials were unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>However, witnesses said one of Harare's main hospitals, Parirenyatwa, had suspended all surgical work except for emergencies and had closed several departments, including its outpatients department.</p>
<p>The civil servants, who are demanding higher allowances and a review of their working conditions, defied a government order on Monday to return to work.</p>
<p>They vowed to strike until the government of President Robert Mugabe gave in to their demands.</p>
<p>This is the second time in two months that Zimbabwean civil servants have gone on strike although this time their numbers are lower.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the striking junior doctors and nurses said about 12,000 of them were on the streets around the country but it was still unclear how many other civil servants were involved as Public Service Association officials were unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>Last month, more than 100,000 government workers -- including mortuary attendants, immigration and customs officials -- went on strike for three weeks, crippling essential social services.</p>
<p>They only went back to work after the government awarded them a 20 percent pay rise and agreed to negotiatiate on working conditions.</p>
