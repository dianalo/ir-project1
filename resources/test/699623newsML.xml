<headline>FINNISH EXCHANGE MERGER SEEN CUTTING COSTS.</headline>

<p>A planned merger of the Helsinki bourse and derivatives exchange SOM may cut costs and boost derivatives trading, but it was no surprise, analysts said.</p>
<p>By joining forces, the two exchanges can reach synergy benefits in technology and other cost savings, and the link-up was a logical event locally, they said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"This was a positive thing locally," said Patrick Hertzberg, head of equities in Helsinki at Swedish Handelsbanken.</p>
<p>"If you develop a system, I should imagine it can easily make use of it for many products, so yes, I see clear synergy benefits," he said.</p>
<p>FIM Securities managing director Jaakko Ylitalo agreed, and added: "We also might see more brokers trading on the derivatives side."</p>
<p>Swedish derivatives exchange OM Gruppen -- which will have a 16 percent stake in the new exchange if all owners convert their holdings -- said the merger was very positive, with scope to boost liquidity.</p>
<p>"Their (the exchanges') challenge is to create liquidity and client value and we think this solution gives chances for this," it said.</p>
<p>Banking group Merita will be the biggest owner in the new exchange -- to be called HEX Oy -- with a 30 percent stake, but voting power will capped at 1/20 of the total.</p>
<p>The exchanges said the merger would create a stronger and more versatile exchange and promote international cooperation based on networking; but some experts still called for more cooperation across borders in the Nordic countries.</p>
<p>"Instead of defending national positions, they could instead be looking to cooperate more with other exchanges," said one who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>"At this time we are not engaged in any negotiations in any direction," SOM chairman Juha Korhonen told a news conference.</p>
<p>"The future is the future, and we believe that with what we have now we will be a strong partner," he said when asked about possible plans for international bourse cooperation.</p>
<p>One expert said SOM and its owners had traditionally been more open and flexible than the bourse. This may help international projects since the SOM's owners acquired a larger share -- 60 percent -- of the new exchange, he added.</p>
