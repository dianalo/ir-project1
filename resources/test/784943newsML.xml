<p>Decisive action is urgently needed if Bangkok's ailing real estate market is to avoid a prolonged market downturn, property company Jones Lang Wootton (JLW) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Already flagging property prices must fall further and business must be laws revamped if confidence is to be restored and the market quickly turned around, said JLW managing director Jeremy Stewardson.</p>
<p>The property sector is at the heart of Thailand's current financial crisis, with analysts estimating banks and finance lending to the real estate sector at about 1.4 trillion baht ($51 billion).</p>
<p>Foreign investors, who are key to a market revival, remain reluctant to enter a market that lacks transparancy and an adequate legal infrastructure, he said.</p>
<p>"Banckruptcy and receivership laws in Thailand are outdated and inadequate... (We need) some internationally recognised bankruptcy and receivership legislation that would enable distressed owners and lenders to get hold of collateral and have proper transparent procedures," Stewardson said.</p>
<p>Even though the Thai currency, the baht, has fallen around 20 percent against the dollar and property prices have dropped about five percent in the first six months of this year, local sellers were still demanding unrealistic prices, Jones Lang Wootton said.</p>
<p>"At the moment there is still a gap between what owners expect and what purchasers are willing to pay, to try to quantify that gap is difficult...but you have to say it is still significant," research director Craig Plumb said.</p>
<p>Many local developers continued to expect to break even on projects and were basing project cost prices on land bought during boom years when values were up to 30 percent higher, Plumb said.</p>
<p>While prices were expected to fall further and market transactions increase, potential buyers were reluctant to commit while uncertainties surrounded the economy and the recently floated currency, he added.</p>
<p>"The complicating factor at the moment is the currency and a number of transactions have been delayed to some extent because of the uncertainties as no one really knows where the currency is going to end up," Plumb said.</p>
<p>Thailand on July 2 changed its 13-year old regime of pegging the baht to a basket of currencies and adopted a managed float. It effectively devalued the baht by about 20 percent.</p>
<p>Though 25 office projects were cancelled or delayed in the first six months, supply in the already overstocked market would continue to accelerate in most sectors as new projects were completed, Plumb said.</p>
<p>The country's financial sector woes had put the expansion plans of many firms on hold and further threatened demand in the office sector, he added.</p>
<p>Previously healthy demand, particularly in the retail sector, was hard hit by the country's economic downturn, as consumer spending has slowed, he said.</p>
<p>"While most sectors of the Bangkok property market have suffered from an increasing oversupply of space, the dramatic deterioration in the Kingdom's overall economy over the first half of 1997 has further dampened market conditions," JLW's second quarter report said.</p>
