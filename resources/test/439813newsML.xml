<p>The rapid increase in the use of lithium-ion batteries in personal computers and other applications will sharply increase the demand for cobalt in Japan, Toyoshi Iida of Tanaka Chemical Corp said.</p>
<p>"Lithium ion batteries are showing momentum to take over in a few years time," Iida told Metal Bulletin's Minor Metals Seminar.</p>
<p>Cobalt oxide is a key part of lithium ion batteries.</p>
<p>Production of lithium ion batteries, used also in camcorders and personal phones, in the year 2000 will be double the level of 1996, Iida said.  </p>
<p>He estimated that in the year 2000, some 400 million cells a year of lithium ion batteries will be produced in Japan, consuming 8,000 tonnes of cobalt. Production of 500 million cells of nickel cadmium and nickel metal hydride batteries in 2000 will consume an additional 500 tonnes of cobalt.</p>
<p>Lithium ion battery production should reach some 200 million cells this year, Iida said.</p>
<p>Japanese battery production consumed 1,300 tonnes of cobalt in 1995, with VTR and other applications pushing the total to 4,800 tonnes, Iida said.  </p>
<p>Tanaka's cobalt consumption has increased sharply to about 800 tonnes last year. Many newcomers are entering the lithium ion battery market because of strong demand.</p>
<p>Japan's battery production in 1995 was 6 billion cells, with lead batteries and manganese batteries taking the lion's share.</p>
<p>Cobalt demand in Japan will get an even bigger boost if the electric vehicle takes off and uses lithium ion batteries. Some 100,000 electric vehicles in the year 2000 would consume 6,000 tonnes of cobalt, Iida estiamted.</p>
