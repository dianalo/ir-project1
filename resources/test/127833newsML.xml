<p>Slovak President Michal Kovac said on Thursday he believed his small country still had a chance of joining NATO with its neighbours when the alliance takes in its first new members by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>"I was convinced the chances of the Slovak Republic to be with its neighbours in the first group is still present," he told reporters after meeting NATO's 16 ambassadors.</p>
<p>Kovac, who has been involved in a bitter feud with Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, said it was now "in the hands of the government" to ensure Slovakia met all the conditions.</p>
<p>The U.S. House of Representatives in July authorised up to $60 million to help three leading NATO applicants -- Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary -- to prepare for membership.</p>
<p>It did not include Slovakia which many western diplomats rule out on the grounds of human rights' abuses and lack of real democratic controls of the government.</p>
<p>Kovac said he thought the West's view of the situation in his country was broadly correct and objective.</p>
<p>"The West is criticising the same things, I myself have been criticising," he said.  REUTER  171838 GMT oct 96</p>
