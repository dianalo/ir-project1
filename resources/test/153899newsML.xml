<title>ITALY: Italian bonds/futures closing report.</title>
<headline>Italian bonds/futures closing report.</headline>
<dateline>MILAN 1996-10-30</dateline>
<text>
<p>Italian bonds and futures generally headed south in late trade although the most traded 10-year July Btp closed a few ticks up on the day.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market had been well bid in morning trade with a reasonable September wage inflation figure of 3.6 percent fuelling hopes that November's consumer prices would come below the 3.0 percent level.</p>
<p>"The bulls won out this morning and the market was squeezed at the start," one London broker said. But the market drifted off later in the day along with Bunds, and the December LIFFE future was 12 basis points down at 122.65.  </p>
<p>Support on the future was at 122.60 and 122.22, with resistance now plotted at the earlier support level of 122.80.</p>
<p>The July 2006 Btp was four basis points up at 104.72 with the spread over the benchmark 10-year Bund at 217 basis points and the yield 8.19 percent.</p>
<p>There was little to influence levels today. Traders noted the UK rate rise but said it had little impact here for now.</p>
<p>Traders said some longs were exiting, making the most of spikes to unload a few positions. "It's gone a long way and bounced off the tops. Now we're getting closer to budget votes people think it's not a bad idea to take profits," one said.  </p>
