<p>Alaska's governor and Canada's top fisheries manager said Tuesday they found common ground during a meeting held on the eve of renewed Pacific Salmon Treaty negotiations.</p>
<p>Gov. Tony Knowles and newly appointed Canadian Fisheries and Oceans Minister David Anderson told reporters they hoped treaty talks would result in improved joint conservation of the beleagured salmon runs.</p>
<p>"This is a very solveable issue," Knowles said from his office in Juneau, where the hour-long meeting was held.</p>
<p>Anderson said he was happy with Knowles' emphasis on fisheries conservation. "I was very pleased that we were so close together on that issue," he told reporters in Juneau.</p>
<p>But Canadian fishermen were anxious to secure a fair share of the harvest, Anderson said.</p>
<p>Anderson said he planned a similar meeting with Washington Gov. Gary Locke.</p>
<p>An overdue update of the Pacific Salmon Treaty has stalled over disputes about allocation of salmon that migrate through the waters of southeast Alaska, British Columbia, Washington and Oregon.</p>
<p>Among the issues of contention is the relatively small chinook harvest in southeast Alaska waters.</p>
<p>British Columbia fishermen accuse their Alaska counterparts of intercepting too many Canada-spawning chinook.</p>
<p>Alaskans, who harvest a mixture of salmon species, say it is nearly impossible to segregate British Columbian spawners from Alaskan spawners.</p>
<p>Both Knowles and Anderson said they want equity negotiations between fishermen to restart in the fall, after the commercial salmon season ends.</p>
<p>Disputes over trans-boundary salmon management have erupted in recent punitive actions. Earlier this summer, four U.S. fishing vessels were detained in British Columbia, and the province's premier announced the revocation of an agreement that allows for U.S. military operations there.</p>
<p>The Alaska Department of Fish and Game has predicted a statewide harvest of 171 million salmon this year. A record 217 million salmon were harvested in Alaska in 1995.</p>
