<headline>LIFFE cocoa ends narrowly up on arbitrage buying.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>London cocoa futures registered small gains in late arbitrage buying against New York on Wednesday after a flat session.</p>
<p>Traders said the third-quarter German grind which rose by a higher-than-expected seven percent from a year ago to 65,824 tonnes was supportive, but the news failed to spark any buying.</p>
<p>"The German grind was good but the market still can't do anything. It's not a dynamic," said one trader.</p>
<p>Some origin selling, including Nigeria and Cameroon, was still creeping in the market, keeping a lid on prices.</p>
<p>By the close, the benchmark March contract had crawled up to 1,006 stg a tonne, four stg higher on the day, but it was off a session peak of 1,009 stg.</p>
<p>Turnover totalled a moderate 3,713 lots.</p>
<p>The May 97/May 98 switch was active at 55 stg and 60 stg while Dec/March traded at 28 and 29 stg, traders said.</p>
<p>German traders who cited a cool summer and export activity, said the increase in the grind fitted a generally strong demand picture in Europe. The UK and Dutch grinds were sharply higher.</p>
<p>But the market spotlight is mainly on the Ivory Coast which is expected to announce its farmer price at the end of this week or the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>The Ivorian season officially starts on October 15 and talk is circulating among some traders that purchases could be slightly delayed.</p>
<p>But even so, analysts expect sufficient supplies pouring in once purchases kick off.</p>
<p>"The official starting date will be irrelevant," said one trader.</p>
<p>"People don't want to buy any Decembers. Even if there is a two-week delay, it not going to make December very strong," said another.</p>
<p>Technical resistance is pegged at 1,025 stg for March while support is around 985 stg.</p>
