<p>The economy kept expanding moderately in August with no clear sign of inflation, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday, though wages appeared to be climbing faster than prices.</p>
<p>The Fed's latest Beige Book summary of national economic activity was issued amid worries that central bank policy-makers may boost interest rates this month to quash inflation risks.</p>
<p>Despite its cautioning about rising wages and labor shortages, the Fed summary did not clearly warn of mounting inflation and financial markets rallied after its noon release.</p>
<p>"Inflation indicators ... were varied and generally inconclusive, although there appears to be greater upward pressure on wages than on prices," concluded the Beige Book summary, prepared by the Cleveland Fed.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average was up 22 points at 5,749 in afternoon trading while the bond market recovered from earlier weakness and the yield on the 30-year bond was steady at 7.11 percent, the same as Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>The findings were based on information collected in interviews with businesses before Sept. 4 in the 12 Fed districts. They will be used when the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee meets on Sept. 24 to decide interest-rate strategy.</p>
<p>The Beige Book surveys are released at about six-week intervals, with the last one published on Aug. 7. The latest survey suggested the economy was holding its momentum entering the second half, rather than slowing as the Fed and many private economists had forecast.</p>
<p>"Business activity in most Districts is reported to be generally good and expanding moderately," the Fed said.</p>
<p>The Minneapolis Fed mentioned a local telephone company that was forced to issue cellular phones to new homeowners because it could not lay cable quickly enough to service them.</p>
<p>Few businesses in any Fed districts saw big price increases since the last survey was concluded on July 30, but none indicated that inflation pressures were subsiding. Some industrial commodities like lumber and steel were rising in price, but it was generally confined to a few markets.</p>
<p>"Wage gains have tended to outstrip price increases, however," the Fed said. The upward pressure on wages seemed most intense in the Richmond and San Francisco Fed districts, but many regions reported wage increases for entry-level jobs.</p>
<p>Many regions saw "pockets" of labor market tightness, with a few saying the scarcity of workers was broadly based. The Chicago Fed said labor markets there were "tighter than the nation as a whole," yet there was no sign of rising wage demands.</p>
<p>The Fed said manufacturing activity was "either expanding or holding steady at a high level" across the country. Few constraints were seen on industrial capacity, and companies in the Boston and Atlanta regions were adding to capacity.</p>
<p>"Building activity remains strong in most parts of the country," the Fed said. "Agriculture conditions vary widely by District, but most regions report better crop conditions today than earlier in the summer."</p>
<p>Back-to-school shopping was "off to a good start," the Fed reported. "Several districts indicated that sales are meeting -- or exceeding -- expectations," it added.</p>
<p>Inventories of unsold goods at the retail level were in line with sales, although some retail stores in the Boston region were cautiously building stocks.</p>
<p>Auto sales were described as "flat or declining slightly" in most parts of the country, but that was partly because dealer inventories of popular models were lean.</p>
<p>"Loan demand appears to be holding steady at a generally high level," the Fed said. The Fed districts reported some deterioration in the credit quality of banks' consumer loans and higher delinquency rates but expressed no concerns about overall debt quality.</p>
