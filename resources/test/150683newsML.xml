<p>California Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush on Tuesday approved a 6.2 percent reduction in workers' compensation insurance costs.</p>
<p>The reduction was expected to save California businesses $316 million next year, Quackenbush said.</p>
<p>A 1995 law deregulating workers' compensation rates directed the Insurance Commissioner to approve advisory loss costs, which reflect the actual costs of paying and adjusting workers' compensation claims.  </p>
<p>Insurers take into account their own loss experience as well as market conditions when setting rates, but consider advisory loss costs as a statistically reliable indicator of costs and trends, the Insurance Department said.</p>
<p>The 6.2 percent decrease represents the average statewide cost reduction in all job classifications.</p>
<p>California employers paid $9 billion for workers' compensation insurance in 1993.  In 1995, they paid $5.1 billion, the lowest total since 1985.</p>
