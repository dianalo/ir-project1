<p>Heartland Wireless Communications Inc reached an agreement with its existing bondholders that will allow the company to issue an additional $125 million in high-yield bonds, sources familiar with the situation said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, the company will pay the holders of its $96.01 million in outstanding bonds a fee of about $6 million in exchange for their consent to go ahead with the deal.  </p>
<p>An official with Heartland declined to confirm or deny that an agreement had been reached.</p>
<p>The consent solicitation offer expires at 1700 EST/2200 GMT, the official said.</p>
<p>"That's an incredibly high fee," said one high-yield cable analyst who declined to be named. "A six point consent solicitation fee plus a likely three point underwriting fee will make this junk deal very expensive for the issuer."</p>
<p>Heartland will use the proceeds from the junk bond offering to expand its wireless cable system which operates primarily in rural areas in the U.S., the sources said.  </p>
<p>The indenture of Heartland's $96.01 million in outstanding bonds stipulates that the company must receive bondholder consent before raising additional capital.</p>
<p>The sources said payment of the fee is contingent on completion of the 144a private placement of $125 million in senior notes due 2004 which is expected to be priced over the next two week.</p>
<p>BT Securities will serve as lead underwriter of the offering, the sources said.</p>
<p>BT officials declined to comment.</p>
<p>Heartland Wireless is headquartered in Durant, Okla. -212-859-1662</p>
