<p>Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian in clashes at Ramallah on Saturday, the first fatality in 10 days of unrest sparked by Israel breaking ground for a Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Palestinian hospital officials said Abdullah Khalil Abdullah, 20, was shot in the back with live ammunition during clashes at the outskirts of Ramallah, a Palestinian self-rule enclave on the West Bank.</p>
<p>"This killing is a declaration of war," said Palestinian Authority Finance Minister Mohammed Nashashibi, as Palestinian ministers prepared for a cabinet meeting in self-rule Gaza.</p>
<p>"It shows who is doing the terrorism against whom," Palestinian Planning Minister Nabil Shaath said.</p>
<p>The death increased fears of an upsurge violence at a time peace moves are threatened by Palestinian outrage over the new settlement and Israeli anger over an Islamist suicide bomber who killed three women in a Tel Aviv cafe last week.</p>
<p>At least 24 other Palestinians were wounded when Israeli troops fired rubber bullets at demonstrators stoning them at the outskirts of Bethlehem, Ramallah, and Bir Zeit in the West Bank. One Palestinian was also wounded by live ammunition and 12 others in Ramallah were hospitalised for tear gas inhalation.</p>
<p>Thousands of Israeli police, backed by tanks and helicopters, were on high alert ahead of warnings unrest would peak on Sunday -- the annual "Land Day" when Israeli Arabs stage protests against government confiscation of lands.</p>
<p>At Bethlehem, protesters burned an effigy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu while the Palestinian Authority rejected Israel's conditions for resuming peace talks.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat told reporters in Gaza on his return from Cairo: "Netanyahu's orders and decisions are escalating the situation in the whole area."</p>
<p>Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah said: "What is needed is the implementation of the agreements and the return to the negotiating table without any preconditions or restrictions.</p>
<p>"The new Israeli conditions are not acceptable."</p>
<p>Arafat convened his cabinet in Gaza on Saturday night to discuss the crisis.</p>
<p>Netanyahu said after meeting U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross on Friday that only a sustained Palestinian crackdown on "terrorism" -- not just a pledge to fight militants -- would salvage peacemaking.</p>
<p>He demanded Arafat arrest militants, dismantle guerrilla groups and tighten security cooperation. He denied Ross asked Israel to make any reciprocal gesture.</p>
<p>Arafat, asked by reporters if Ross in their meeting in Rabat on Thursday requested him to calm tensions in areas controlled by his Palestinian Authority that abut Israeli army positions where there have been clashes said:</p>
<p>"Yes, they are against the violence, especially the violence of settlement and the Judaization of Jerusalem."</p>
<p>Palestinian-Israeli peace moves plunged into crisis this month after Israel began the settlement at a hilltop called Jabal Abu Ghneim in Arabic and Har Homa in Hebrew and after the Islamist suicide bombing in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Israel says Arafat gave militants the impression they had a green light for attacks. The Authority denies the charge.</p>
<p>Palestinians say settlement building in Jerusalem preempts negotiations that are to be held on its status in final peace talks which have yet to resume. They demand it be halted.</p>
<p>Europe's Middle East envoy, Miguel Angel Moratinos, speaking to reporters after meeting Arafat in Gaza, said political issues should be the top priority in peace talks.</p>
<p>"We have also to convey the security issue. President Arafat told me he is always condemning terrorism and violence...I'm going to bring this matter to Prime Minister Netanyahu," he said. Moratinos did not say when he would meet Netanyahu.</p>
<p>Ross, who wound up a two-day emergency shuttle on Friday, said he would report back to U.S. President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright before deciding how to tackle the crisis. He called for calm.</p>
