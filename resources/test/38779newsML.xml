<p>Government investment officials will present a report to Southeast Asian economic ministers next week on ways to boost investment in the region, ASEAN Secretary- General Ajit Singh said on Friday.</p>
<p>Singh said the officials discussed a framework for an ASEAN Investment Area (AIA) during a three-day meeting ending on Friday.</p>
<p>"They are discussing ways to give it a conceptual framework and vision and work out procedures for putting it into action," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) gave their support to an AIA at their summit in Bangkok last year.</p>
<p>The investment report will be presented to the ASEAN economic ministers at their annual meeting next Thursday following a meeting of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) council on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Singh said the aim was to "facilitate and liberalise investment measures in ASEAN" to boost both intra-ASEAN investment and foreign investment from outside the region.</p>
<p>"The concern is that with all the other regions becoming competitive, ASEAN has to remain attractive and be among the best, if not in front of the field as far as investment is concerned....</p>
<p>"This is a very competitive field and we must continue to attract investment which we need very badly," he said.</p>
<p>The investment meeting is one of a series of gatherings in preparation for next week's economic ministers' meetings.</p>
<p>Customs officials on Thursday completed a legal framework for customs cooperation in ASEAN covering the harmonisation of tariff nomenclature, customs valuation and customs procedures in the region.</p>
<p>Singh said the customs agreement, which now must be signed by the appropriate ministers, would help facilitate trade within ASEAN and give private business a point of reference when dealing with customs matters.</p>
<p>ASEAN groups Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, the Philippines and Brunei.</p>
