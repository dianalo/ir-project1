<headline>BASEBALL-MURRAY HITS 500TH HOMER BUT O'S LOSE GROUND TO YANKEES.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-09-07</dateline>

<p>Eddie Murray hit his historic 500th home run Friday, but it came in a losing cause as his Baltimore Orioles slipped further behind the New York Yankees in the American League East pennant race.</p>
<p>Cecil Fielder homered twice, including a tie-breaking solo shot in the eighth inning, and Mariano Rivera blew a save but rebounded to lead the first-place Yankees to a 4-3 win over the visiting Toronto Blue Jays, widening New York's lead in the A.L. East to five games.</p>
<p>Fielder, who led off the third with a homer, started the eighth with his 35th of the season to give New York a 4-3 lead and complete his 32nd career multi-homer game.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter where it comes from or who gets it done, we just need runs," Fielder said.</p>
<p>New York has won five of its last seven games.</p>
<p>New York starter Jimmy Key allowed a run and six hits through the first six innings and left with a two-run lead.</p>
<p>Rivera came on and promptly allowed the tying runs. But he rebounded to put out the fire, strike out two in the eighth and two more in the ninth, setting the side down in order both times.</p>
<p>"He spoils you so much," Yankees manager Joe Torre said of Rivera. "When he doesn't get the first guy out, you think something's wrong. He did a great job getting out of the jam. It was a huge win."</p>
<p>Yankee closer John Wetteland was activated from the disabled list earlier in the day, but was not used.</p>
<p>The win was New York's 100th straight when leading after eight innings. The Yankees have not blown a lead heading into the ninth since August 24 of last season.</p>
<p>In Baltimore, Bob Higginson singled home Phil Nevin with the game-winning run in the 12th inning as the Detroit Tigers beat the Orioles 5-4.</p>
<p>Murray became the 15th member of the 500-home run club with a solo shot in the seventh inning, his first homer in a week. It came on the first pitch from Tigers starter Felipe Lira and lifted the Orioles into a 3-3 tie.</p>
<p>Murray is the third player in major-league history to have 500 homers and 3,000 hits in his career, joining immortals Willie Mays and Hank Aaron.</p>
<p>Higginson also had a solo homer in the eighth and Nevin had a solo shot in the third and an RBI single in the fourth.</p>
<p>Rafael Palmeiro hit his 33rd home run for Baltimore.</p>
<p>John Cummings (3-0) got the win and Terry Mathews (0-1) took the loss, both in relief.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Mo Vaughn had four hits and scored three runs and Bill Haselman added three hits and two RBI as the Boston Red Sox pounded the White Sox 10-3.</p>
<p>The victory moved the Red Sox within 2 1/2 games of Chicago, which leads the wild-card race.</p>
<p>Tim Wakefield (12-12) pitched seven innings and raised his record to 7-3 since the All-Star break. He gave up three runs and eight hits with six walks and three strikeouts.</p>
<p>Mark Brandenburg finished up with two innings of one-hit relief as Boston improved to 24-8 since August 3.</p>
<p>Chicago starter Wilson Alvarez (15-8) took the loss.</p>
<p>In Milwaukee, John Burkett came within one out of a complete game and Juan Gonzalez had a two-run double to snap a fifth-inning tie and added his 43rd homer as the Texas Rangers defeated the Brewers 7-3.</p>
<p>Burkett (3-1) allowed three runs -- two earned -- and seven hits before leaving with two out in the ninth.</p>
<p>Gonzalez has 129 RBI, four behind Cleveland's Albert Belle for the major-league lead.</p>
<p>The Rangers increased their lead in the A.L. West to 6 1/2 games over Seattle.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, Brad Radke tossed a five-hitter for his first career complete game and Pat Meares broke a tie with a two-run single in the seventh as the Twins defeated the California Angels 6-2.</p>
<p>Radke (9-14) allowed two runs, walked one and struck out a career-high 10 to earn his first win since August 11.</p>
<p>Minnesota has won four of its last five and is 4-0 against California this season.</p>
<p>Loser Chuck Finley (13-14) pitched his third complete game of the season, allowing six runs.</p>
<p>In Oakland, Willie Adams (3-2) allowed one run over seven innings and errors by shortstop Jose Offerman and third baseman Craig Paquette allowed two runs to score in the fifth as the Athletics beat the Kansas City Royals 7-1.</p>
<p>Oakland's Mark McGwire slugged his major-league leading 47th homer, a two-run job.</p>
<p>The game in Cleveland between the Seattle Mariners and the Indians was postponed due to rain and will be made up a part of a doubleheader Sunday.</p>
