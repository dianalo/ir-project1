<p>IBCA, the European credit rating agnecy, said on Thursday it had assigned an individual rating of B/C and a legal rating of 4 to Singapore's Tat Lee Bank.  </p>
<p>Tat Lee is the smnallest bank in Singapore and is family controlled although the government owns around 25 percent of the bank, IBCA said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Tat Lee Bank is the least profitable bank in Singapore but has an adequate overall financial profile, the agency said.</p>
<p>"The mediocre profitability results from two factors: a high cost structure related to a relatively large branch network and a high tax burden."</p>
<p>It said Tat Lee's adequate overall financial profile was a reflection of high capitalisation rather than profitability.  </p>
<p>"Its equity/assets ratio is the highest among Singapore banks. Based on a high equity/loans ratio and its housing loan book, IBCA estimates the bank's Tier1 risk weighted capital adequacy ratio to be at least 25 percent," IBCA said.</p>
<p>A bank's individual rating is an evaluation of its financial strength on the premise that it is independent and therefore unable to rely on support from state authorities or its owners.</p>
<p>IBCA's Legal ratings are evaluated on the basis of the likelihood of support from owners or government authorities if it ran into difficulties. A Legal rating of 4 indicates that support is likely but not certain.</p>
