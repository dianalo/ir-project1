<p>Progressive Enterprises Ltd said on Tuesday group sales for the 13 weeks to April 27 were worth NZ$523.2 million, down 2.1 percent on the third quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Year-to-date sales of NZ$1.59 billion were 1.9 percent below the prior year.</p>
<p>On a comparable basis -- removing the impact of store and restaurant openings and closures -- group sales fell by 0.1 percent for the quarter and 0.8 percent for the year-to-date. All divisions were performing in line with expectations.  </p>
<p>Foodtown continued to trade above prior levels, while Countdown traded marginally below that of the previous year.</p>
<p>3 Guys stores traded significantly below that of the prior year on a comparable store basis.</p>
<p>The board had approved recommendations on future branding, format and network issues which will see the rationalisation over several years of the company's supermarkets into two distinct groups.</p>
<p>The first would be a chain of regional superstores branded as Countdown and secondly a chain of neighbourhood conventional supermarkets trading as Foodtown.</p>
