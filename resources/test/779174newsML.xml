<p>The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration said a Korean Air Lines Boeing 747 crashed on Tuesday on the Pacific island of Guam after losing contact with radar about three miles (five km) from the airport.</p>
<p>FAA spokesman Eliot Brenner said the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board would investigate the crash with FAA participation. He said the FAA had no firm number for the number on board Korean Air Lines flight 801 from Seoul.  </p>
<p>An FAA spokeswoman later said the plane had just been cleared for landing at 2:35 a.m. local time on Wednesday when radar contact was lost.</p>
<p>She said there were unconfirmed reports that 331 people were on board but the airline would have to confirm the number.</p>
<p>Air safety sources said visibility at the time of the crash was limited to about one mile (1.6 km) due to heavy rain but the FAA could not confirm this.</p>
