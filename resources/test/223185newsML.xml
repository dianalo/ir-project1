<p>Britain on Thursday pledged to keep up the pressure on its European Union partners to bring about liberalisation in the gas sector but admitted the path faced hurdles and reluctant members.</p>
<p>"The world is changing. The old certainties of state monopoly provision no longer offer the best opportunities for ensuring energy supply or for maximising consumer benefit," Lord Fraser, minister for energy at the Department of Trade and Industry, told a conference.</p>
<p>"The market solution works: it is working now in the U.K. and it will work for the rest of Europe, given the chance. At long last we are moving in the right direction, and the U.K. will keep up the pressure until the job is done," he told the Institute of Economic Affairs European Energy Forum.</p>
<p>Lord Fraser said partial opening up of competition in utilities in Britain and Scandinavia under a draft EU directive showed competition worked.</p>
<p>"We now need to do the same thing for gas...I appreciate that there are concerns about this change of direction...for example, the risk of stranded assets if competition undermines the economics of existing contracts, or about security of supply.</p>
<p>"But I believe the risks are manageable, and that security is in fact enhanced by competition, as new entrants and sources are encouraged into the market."</p>
<p>Britain, which expects soon to be a net gas exporter, has led the way in opening up its gas market to competition. But not all EU countries agree on the pace and extent of liberalisation, with some like France wanting to keep some form of price control.</p>
<p>"But many nations around the world, some of them in Europe, are not yet convinced by the arguments, partly at least because powerful incumbents are protective of their positions," Lord Fraser said.</p>
<p>He added that since Britain allowed a free market to develop, the energy industries were no longer a burden on the taxpayer while consumers had benefited.</p>
<p>He said that for western Europe, new pipelines either operational or in the process of being built from Algeria and Norway as well as the planned Interconnector from Britain to Belgium meant a security of supply.</p>
<p>"Europe-wide liberalisation, melding many markets with different starting points, will be more tricky than opening up a single domestic market, as we have done. But the prize is worth the effort and in the long run it is the people of the Union who will be the beneficiaries," Lord Fraser said.</p>
