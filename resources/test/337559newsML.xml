<p>The world's largest refined silver producer Industrias Penoles took a double blow in 1996, as world gold and silver prices weakened and the peso remained steady, analysts said.</p>
<p>"Silver and gold prices started to decline in December which has squeezed margins," ING Barings analyst Sebastian Barry-Taylor said.</p>
<p>In a survey of five analysts, average estimated earnings for 1996 were 2.53 per share, compared with 2.99 the previous year.  </p>
<p>A combination of a slipping peso and higher gold and silver prices boosted earnings for 1995.  Penoles benefits from a weak peso as most of the company's transactions are completed in dollars.</p>
<p>Although 1996 ended with a whimper as gold and silver prices weakened, plans to boost production probably helped the company's earnings recover some of the lost ground.</p>
<p>"The fourth quarter saw better sales volume but was also affected by low metal prices," BBV-Probursa analyst Jose Buendia.  </p>
<p>Gold and silver prices fell to $357 and $4.66 respectively per ounce, compared with 1996 averages of $387 for gold and $5.20 for silver.  Many brokerages lowered their earnings estimates for Penoles in light of the squeeze on precious metal prices.</p>
<p>The company's health in 1997 will depend on the company's expansion programs and silver and gold prices, analysts agreed.   Penoles is also working to reduce its vulnerability</p>
<p>to volatile world metal prices.  </p>
<p>The company's sodium sulfate and other chemicals output is expected to boom through greater extraction, Salomon Brothers analyst Mauricio Reveco wrote in a recent report.</p>
<p>Geographic and mining diversification toward more value-added products will also hedge dependence on metal prices, he said.</p>
<p>"We expect Penoles' treatment and production capacity expansions, along with greater operating efficiency, will fuel rapid growth in earnings at a compound annual real growth rate of 18.3 percent in 1996-2001 period," the report said.</p>
<p>Reveco said long-term contracts and more direct contact with clients is part of a larger effort to protect against sharp drops in metal prices.</p>
