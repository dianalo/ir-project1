<p>Luxembourg's economy will accelerate in 1997 and 1998, while jobs growth remains robust and consumer price inflation averages around two percent, the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development said.</p>
<p>In a semi-annual report released on Thursday the Paris-based think tank forecast Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at market prices would grow by more than three percent in both 1997 and 1998 versus a 2.4 percent increase in 1996.</p>
<p>Exports were expected to remain buoyant, reflecting the economic upturn in neighbouring countries and a more competitive steel industry. As a result, the contribution of foreign trade to growth was likely to become positive again.</p>
<p>On the domestic front, gross fixed investment should remain the most dynamic component of total demand, it said.</p>
<p>But the growth of private consumption may pick up only moderately, in line with the evolution of real wages.</p>
<p>Employment growth was projected to accelerate but as most new jobs would probably be filled with cross-border workers the unemployment rate may decline only slowly to slightly less than three percent in 1998, the report said..</p>
<p>The general government budget was likely to remain in surplus.</p>
<p>The main risks to the projections were a weaker than expected recovery in continental Europe which would "significantly depress" economic activity in Luxembourg, especially in the steel industry.</p>
