<p>Ethnic Germans who pose the main obstacle to a declaration intended to seal post-World War Two reconciliation between Germany and the Czech Republic criticised Bonn on Wednesday for failing to consult them over negotiations.</p>
<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Tuesday in Lisbon they believed the lingering dispute between the two states could be resolved soon.</p>
<p>But the chairman of the Sudeten German community, Franz Neubauer, told German Radio he was disappointed with the Bonn government's behaviour.</p>
<p>"The coalition didn't think it necessary to inform the Sudeten Germans of the exact wording (of the declaration).</p>
<p>"That makes little sense, to discuss the wishes of the expellees if everything is already fixed. The decisions are once again being taken over the heads of those concerned."</p>
<p>Neubauer said he was meeting Kohl and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel this week to discuss the matter. Kohl said in September he wanted a text to be approved by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The Sudeten Germans form the main block to the parliamentary declaration, which is intended to put the Czech Republic on the same friendly footing with Germany as the other countries which suffered Nazi invasion.</p>
<p>The dispute concerns ethnic Germans who were expelled from Czech territory after World War Two. Nazi Germany took over the country before the outbreak of war in Europe and kept it under brutal occupation almost until the end of the war.</p>
<p>The Sudeten Germans, backed by the Bavarian CSU who are partners in Kohl's centre-right coalition government, have demanded that Prague treat them as a full negotiating partner by consulting them directly and that it acknowledge that the expulsion of 2.5 million ethnic Germans was an injustice.</p>
<p>Prague has argued that the expulsion was legitimate in principle, though often carried out with regrettable brutality. It wants compensation from Germany for victims of the Nazi occupation like that already accorded to other countries.</p>
<p>Germany, which has often felt surrounded by enemies, is eager to build lasting security by bringing its Central and Eastern European neighbours into NATO and the European Union.</p>
