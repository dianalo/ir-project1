<p>French state-owned aerospace group Aerospatiale on Saturday said it needed permission from the government before it could make any offer to buy Thomson-CSF with merger partner Dassault Aviation.</p>
<p>The Le Monde newspaper said on Saturday that the government would have a favourable disposition to such a bid and said Alcatel Alsthom could also be associated with the bid.</p>
<p>Aerospatiale spokesman Patrice Kreis told Reuters that Aerospatiale and Dassault Aviation were at the moment not preparing an offer to acquire the state's 58 percent stake in defence electronics group Thomson-CSF.</p>
<p>"At the moment, and I say that after having talked to the boss -- chairman Yves Michot -- a few minutes ago, at the moment we are not working on an offer.</p>
<p>But he confirmed that the chairmen of the two companies had expressed an interest in aquiring Thomson-CSF.</p>
<p>Kreis said the companies had to await the terms of the new procedure for the sale of Thomson-CSF, expected in January, and for the green light of the state as shareholder before they could make a bid.</p>
<p>At the Ministry of Defence, an official said, "It is certain that Yves Michot and (Dassault Aviation chairman) Serge Dassault are working on an offer."</p>
