<p>Air Ukraine, the former Soviet republic's biggest carrier, said on Wednesday that two Boeing 767-200ERs and three Airbus 320-200s would be delivered by the end of 1999.</p>
<p>"We'll get the first Boeing next year and the second one in 1999. All three Airbuses will be delivered to Ukraine within two years," the state-owned carrier's Vice-President Oleh Narizhny told Reuters.</p>
<p>Boeing Corp won a tender last month to replace Soviet-made Illyushin 62s, and is due to provide Air Ukraine with two Boeing 767-200s for Transatlantic routes.</p>
<p>European Airbus Industrie won a tender to supply three Airbus 320-200s for middle-range routes.</p>
<p>Air Ukraine flies four times per week to New York and once to Chicago and Toronto but plans to add Los Angeles, Miami and Montreal routes by 1999 as well as renew flights to Washington.</p>
<p>Narizhny said U.S. aviation authorities had extended a deadline for a ban on Il-62s flights to the United States because of noisy take-offs and landings and safety considerations until Boeings were delivered to Air Ukraine.</p>
<p>He said Air Ukraine would start using the Boeing for flights to the United States in the middle of next year.</p>
