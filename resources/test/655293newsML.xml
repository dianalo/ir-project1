<p>Shares in First South African Foods Ltd dipped on Wednesday as profit-takers moved out of the share after the group's roaring bourse debut on Tuesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>"It is just off on some profit-taking after a very stong first day," one dealer said.</p>
<p>First Food dropped 15 cents to 340 cents in volumes of more than 430,000 shares.</p>
<p>The firm, which had been offered at an issue price of 200 cents, had surged as high as 375 cents on its first day's trading as dealers poured into the stock.</p>
<p>The initial share rise had been so marked because the public offer had been limited with the majority of shares being retained by holding firm First South Africa Holdings (FSAH), management or offered to institutions in a private placing.</p>
<p>The firm, which invests in niched food manufacturing operations, aims to use the cash raised in the flotation to pursue a number of expansion opportunities.</p>
<p>First Food owns four operating companies, namely Piemans Pantry, Astoria Bakery, Seemann's Quality Meat Products and Gull Food.</p>
<p>FSAH is a sibling of Nasdaq-quoted firm First South Africa Corp .</p>
