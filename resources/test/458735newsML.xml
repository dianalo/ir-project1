<p>The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) on Friday said it had approved binding limits for capital adequacy ratios for banks with state participation for this year, bringing them in line with international standards.</p>
<p>"The bank board approved binding limits for capital adequacy ratios of transforming banks (those with state participation) for the year 1997, so that (their) capital adequacy reaches the international standard," a statement issued after the board's regular meeting said.</p>
<p>It did not say what the limit was.  </p>
<p>The NBS had required banks' capital adequacy ratios to reach 8.0 percent by the end of 1996, with the exception of banks where the state hold an interest -- Slovenska Sporitelna, VUB, IRB.</p>
<p>"The NBS will take measures in accordance with law...in case they (the ratio limits) are breached," the statement added.</p>
<p>Under Slovak law, any bank breaching capital adequacy requirements may be subject to a fine of up to 10 million crowns or a requirement to reduce its basic capital or possibly be placed under central bank forced administration.</p>
