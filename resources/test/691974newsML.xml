<p>Bulgaria's central bank governor Svetoslav Gavriiski said on Friday that interest rates will remain stable around current levels in the next few months after the government launches a currency board system on July 1.</p>
<p>"If the interest rate calculation method does not change, I suppose the rates will remain at current levels," Gavriiski said in a state television interview.</p>
<p>The BNB cut its main rate to effective annual 10.60 percent on Thursday from 16.30 percent. The rate is calculated on the average yield to maturity on three-month discount T-bills, said Gavriiski.</p>
<p>This was a change from a previous practice where the main rate has been adjusted to the weighted average effective monthly yield on four-week discount T-bills auctioned daily by the Finance Ministry.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry has stopped the four-week issues as the budget no longer needed short-term funding, said Gavriiski.</p>
<p>"What is happening now, with the falling interest rates, is a proof that the currency board in Bulgaria is already operating successfuly," said Gavriiski.</p>
<p>Interest rates have come down to 1.27 percent monthly from 18 percent in March.</p>
<p>Bulgaria is due to introduce on July 1 an IMF-prescribed restrictive monetary policy, known as currency board. The system bans central bank lending to the government and commercial banks and requires the levs in circulation be fully covered by foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<p>Bugaria pegged the lev to the mark as anchor currency at an exchange rate of 1,000.</p>
<p>Economists warn that if rates fall too low, Bulgarian T-bills and other government securities may loose their appeal to foreign investors, which invested in the past few months around $140 million in Bulgarian paper.</p>
<p>The government's stringent monetary policy, backed by a 510 million standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund govt(IMF) since March, has led to a noticeable stabilisation.</p>
<p>The lev has traded steady at around 1,600 to the dollar and 950 to the mark in the past three months, after nosediving to 3,000 per dollar in February pressed by political and economic turmoil.</p>
<p>Inflation has since then steadily declined to 5.6 percent in May and minus 0.7 percent in April from 243 percent in February.</p>
<p>The lev eased to 995-997 per mark at Friday's close from the morning's 993-996, moving towards the 1,000-per-mark currency board peg.</p>
<p>The central bank has been buying marks on global and domestic markets in the past week to ensure it will meet demand for marks when currency board system is offically introduced next week, said Gavriiski earlier this week. -- Elisaveta Konstantinova, Sofia Newsroom, +3592-687181, +359-799-30990</p>
