<p>Slovenian shares advanced for the fifth straight day on Tuesday, pulled up by drug firm Lek which was the focus of strong international demand.</p>
<p>The blue-chip SBI index rose 0.7 percent to 1,469.85, as turnover jumped to 532.5 million tolars from 273.1 million.</p>
<p>Traders forecast the SBI would reach 1,500 points by the end of the week, adding foreign buying accounted for about 60 percent of total volume.</p>
<p>Issue A of drug company Lek was the most actively traded stock, up 2.65 percent to 34,900 tolars on volume of 11,543 shares.</p>
<p>"The demand for Lek is very strong. Once the price hits 35,000 tolars it will jump to 40,000 in a matter of days," one trader said.</p>
<p>A second saw investor interest fanning out across the board and noted Slovenian shares were competitively priced in comparison with other stock markets in the region.</p>
<p>"If one compares the book value and price/earnings ratio of Slovenian firms to similar firms in the Czech Republic and Hungary, the Slovenian firms are about three times cheaper," said Alain Al Soufi, a trader at brokerage BPH.</p>
<p>"There is no limit to the gains if foreign demand continues," he added.</p>
<p>Analysts said drug makers Lek and Krka, petrol trader Petrol and trader Mercator were likely to generate the highest profits in the short-term.</p>
<p>Overall eight SBI shares rose, 11 fell, one was unchanged and eight were untraded.</p>
<p>Ordinary shares of trader Kovinotehna were the top gainers, up 8.89 percent to 490 tolars on volume of 8,350 shares.</p>
<p>Preferred shares of bank Hipotekarna banka Brezice were the leading decliners, down 9.12 percent to 2,999 tolars on volume of just two shares.</p>
<p>Petrol firmed 0.8 percent to 21,010 tolars on volume of 2,999 shares.</p>
<p>Krka, which is traded on the over-the-counter (OTC) market, eased 0.5 percent to 23,190 tolars in a technical correction after rising 13 percent since last Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mercator, another OTC share, remained unchanged at 5,400 tolars on volume of 7,260 shares.</p>
