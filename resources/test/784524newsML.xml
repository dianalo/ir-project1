<p>Ivory Coast is considering raising its reference coffee farmgate price for 1997/98 (Oct-Sept) above 500 CFA francs a kilo following world price rises in 1996/97, Agriculture minister Lambert Kouassi Konan said in an interview.</p>
<p>"It is likely that the next season will open with a higher reference price," he was quoted as saying by Paris-based magazine Jeune Afrique in an interview published on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"At the moment, coffee prices are heading up," he added.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast's state Caistab marketing board opened its 1996/97 coffee season late with a farmgate price 200 CFA francs down at 500 CFA francs, including a five CFA per kilo allowance for jute bags.</p>
<p>The Caistab lost money in 1995/96 as prices fell after farm-to-port marketing prices had been set high at 700 CFA francs a kilo.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast forecast a crop of 230,000 tonnes for 1996/97 but port arrivals already total over 300,000 tonnes, the highest since the early 1980s and well above the 180,000 tonnes in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Koussi said prices could fall below reference levels if harvests were large.</p>
<p>A secondary market paying above reference coffee prices developed during the smaller harvest in 1995/96, he said.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast has loosened its monopoly on cocoa and coffee marketing since 1995 under terms for a $150 million agriculture credit from the World Bank -- which wants further changes.</p>
<p>Cocoa and coffee liberalisation are on a wider agenda for aid talks with the International Monetary Fund next week on a three-year economic plan for Ivory Coast.</p>
<p>Donors want the state Caistab commodities board to hand farm-to-port price-setting to the private sector, with exporters possibly assuming a greater role in export auction management.</p>
<p>Ivory Coast has agreed to sweeping coffee marketing reforms from 1998/99, and some for cocoa from 1999/2000, but full details have yet to be decided.</p>
