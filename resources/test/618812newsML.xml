<p>Singapore shares opened slightly higher on Tuesday in thin volume.</p>
<p>Dealers said activity might pick up later as funds reappeared after holidays in London and the U.S. on Monday.</p>
<p>"I think it will be a little more lively today but we're still not expecting much movement away from these ranges," said one local dealer.</p>
<p>"We see a gentle rise towards 2,100 points on the index and then a drift off again," said another.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-share Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) was 3.30 points higher at 2,059.62 by 0150 GMT.</p>
<p>Malaysian shares dominated early volume with timber group Construction and Supplies House Bhd down a cent (0.69 U.S. cents) to Singapore $2.27 as recent rumours of a merger with an unnamed group faded.</p>
<p>The UOB OTC index of Malaysian shares was down 4.30 at 1160.34 points.</p>
<p>Of the STII shares, Singapore Telecom was up three cents at S$2.49 on bargain buying by some funds after a recent sell-off.</p>
<p>"Singapore Telecom has underperformed the market and, as it is a major index stock, it is being bought by index matchers," said another dealer.</p>
<p>US$1 = S$1.44</p>
