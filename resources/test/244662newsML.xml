<headline>BAe gains amid renewed defence hopes.</headline>

<p>Shares in British Aerospace Plc rose on Monday after positive comment in the Sunday Times and a report in the Times newspaper said it continued to seek a role in a 100 billion stg fighter project contract.</p>
<p>The stock was marked 6p higher at 11.08-1/2 by 0741 GMT.  </p>
<p>The Times said BAe was in talks with both consortiums bidding for the Joint Strike Fighter commissioned by the UK and U.S. governments, after its design was rejected last month by American defence chiefs.</p>
<p>Separately the Sunday Times said BAe was also being courted by both bidders for the JSA contract.</p>
<p>The Sunday Times also said BAe could still pursue the merger of its missile business with Matra and Thomson, despite last week's French decision to suspend the privatisation.</p>
<p>The paper said the stock "can only benefit when either the French or the American deal materialises."</p>
