<p>President Bill Clinton on Wednesday announced his intention to designate William Kennard, general counsel of the Federal Communications Commission, to be its next chairman.</p>
<p>Kennard, 40, has been the FCC's general counsel for 3-1/2 years. If, as expected, he wins Senate confirmation, he would be the first black to head the five-member regulatory agency.  </p>
<p>Kennard would replace Reed Hundt, who has announced his plans to resign as chairman and leave the agency.</p>
<p>Clinton also formally nominated Michael Powell, the son of retired Army Chief of Staff Colin Powell, to be a member of the FCC.</p>
<p>Powell currently is the chief of staff of the Justice Department's antitrust division.</p>
