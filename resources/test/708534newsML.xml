<p>Hong Kong stocks look set for a rebound on Friday, with new records on Wall Street and continued strength in shares of HSBC Holdings Plc likely to wipe out Thursday's losses, brokers said.</p>
<p>"Today we are going to rebound, led by Hongkong Bank which was strong in London. Yesterday's selling in property stocks was a little bit overdone," said Antony Mak, sales director at Vickers Ballas. "We are likely to recover yesterday's losses."</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index fell 141.05 points to 15,055.74 on Thursday, the first trading day under Chinese rule. Later, the Hang Seng London Reference Index rose 85.83 points to 15,141.57.  </p>
<p>HSBC shares climed HK$3.15 in London trade to close at HK$241.15.</p>
<p>Kent Rossiter, institutional sales trader at Nikko Securities, said he expected the Hang Seng Index to trade in a range of 15,000 to 15,200 points. But he said property stocks could still see some weakness on Friday.</p>
<p>"In the short term there is going to be a little bit of pressure. There is going to be uncertainty until the government announces the details of its property measures," he said.</p>
