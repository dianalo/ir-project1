<p>Geotek Communications, Inc. said Wednesday International Business Machines Corp. has agreed to market the company's wireless voice and data communications services nationwide.</p>

<p>"This agreement will enable us to provide customers with the highest quality products and service as we expand our networks across the United States," said Jonathan Crane, president and chief operating officer of Geotek.</p>
<p>"With IBM marketing our digital 900 MHz wireless voice and packet data services, we are creating a powerful new distribution channel that will serve the needs of businesses seeking advanced communications solutions for managing mobile workers."</p>
<p>The deal is part of an ongoing relationship between the two companies. Last year IBM agreed to provide construction and project management for Geotek's digital wireless networks.</p>
