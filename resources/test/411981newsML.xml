<p>Standard and Poor's ratings agency said on Friday it had lowered the short term rating on Alcoa of Australia Limited to A-1 from A-1 positive, and affirmed the long term A-positive corporate credit rating.  </p>
<p>The downgrade "reflects the imminent impact of an A$300 million capital reduction program on the company's finanical risk profile," S&amp;P said in a statement, adding that Alcoa of Australia (AoA) had publicly indicated the programme was likely to be approved at an extraordinary meeting on March 6.</p>
<p>Alcoa of Australia is 60 percent owned by Aluminum Co of America and 39.25 percent by WMC Ltd.</p>
<p>"The corporate credit rating of AoA continues to reflect its market position as an extremely low cost producer of alumina and aluminium and the strong parentage of Alcoa," S&amp;P said.  </p>
<p>S&amp;P said Alcoa's and WMC's long and short-term credit ratings were unaffected by the proposed capital reduction programme.</p>
<p>"The rating outlook is stable," S&amp;P said, with AoA's business risk profile unaltered by the programme.</p>
