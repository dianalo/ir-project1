<p>Analysts International Inc chairman and chief executive officer Frederick Lang backed an analyst's estimate of $1.12 a share for fiscal 1997 earnings.</p>
<p>"Over the next three quarters Hanifen, Imhoff has us at $0.26, $0.28 (Corrects) and $0.31 for $1.12 for the year," Lang said on Thursday after the company's annual shareholders meeting. Hanifen, Imhoff is a Denver, Colo.-based investment bank.</p>
<p>"That's about a 33 percent increase for the year. At this early stage in the game, it seems reasonable, certainly feasible," he told Reuters.  </p>

<p>Analysts International, which provides computer software services to communications and electronics companies, earned $0.84 for its year ended June 30, 1996 adjusted for a two-for-one stock split paid September 30, 1996.</p>
<p>Lang declined to predict the amount of revenue the company might generate in fiscal 1997 from services to solve its clients problems in reprogramming computer software for the year 2000.</p>
<p>"That's hard to predict right now. We're completely up to capacity in normal work. As it is, we've got 25 percent more requirements than we have people. We'll get into the 2000 work as we need to," Lang said.</p>
<p>Shareholders at the meeting approved a proposal to increase the number of authorized common shares to 40 million from 20 million. The shares might be used for stock splits or acquisitions.</p>
