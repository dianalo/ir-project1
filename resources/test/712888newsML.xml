<p>Hungary's overnight interest rates dropped to 19.50 percent in ample liquidity on Tuesday following Monday's repo rate cut by the central bank, traders said.</p>
<p>"Monday's rate cut contributed to the drop in overnight rates, but there is also the fact that we are at the beginning of the (bank's two-week) reserve period," said Jozsef Laczi of ING Bank.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Hungary cut four of its five repo rates on Monday by 25 basis points each, of which the benchmark one-week reverse repo facility was reduced to 20.00 percent from 20.25 percent.</p>
<p>Overnight rates traded between 19.375 and 20.125 percent compared with Monday's close of 20.00 percent and the majority of the deals were struck at around 19.50 percent.</p>
<p>Laczi added that money flowing back from the central bank's reverse repo facility might also have contributed to the increase in liquidity.</p>
