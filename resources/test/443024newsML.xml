<p>Textron Inc Chairman and Chief Executive James Hardymon reiterated the company's revenue growth target of eight to 11 percent annually to the year 2001 and added that so far this year, the company was on track to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Textron had stated its eight to 11 percent revenue growth goal at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Speaking at a Smith Barney Multi-Industry Conference in New York City, he said that revenue growth would be driven by four initiatives:  internal investment, acquisitions, international expansion and improvement in operating margins and cash flow.</p>
<p>Hardymon said that over the next five years internal growth will account for about 60 percent of revenue growth, twice the level of the past five years.  The company would continue to make strategic acquisitions, he said, though not at the same rate as during the last five years.</p>
<p>Hardymon said Textron currently had operating margins of about 11.8 percent, and hoped to drive this figure up to 13 percent.</p>
