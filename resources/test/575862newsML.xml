<p>Stevedores from Brazil's Santos port are set to hold talks Monday with representatives from local steel firm Cosipa to resolve a labor dispute which already led to two strikes, a Cosipa spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Stevedores have been protesting a decision by Cosipa to use its own workers to load and unload vessels at its private terminal in Santos. Last week union leaders presented a proposal to reduce total costs for Cosipa by around 60 percent.</p>
<p>Cosipa is now expected to reply to the proposal at the meeting to take place at 1400 local/1700 GMT but the spokeswoman said she had no information as to what the reply will be.</p>
<p>For the time being, no other meetings are planned, she added. ((-Caroline Bulloch, Rio de Janeiro newsroom, 5521 5074151))</p>
