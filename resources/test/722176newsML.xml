<p>Central American presidents meet on Saturday to discuss ways to boost trade ties, foster a free-trade agreement with the United States and trim costs of regional institutions.</p>
<p>Foreign ministers and delegates on Friday were hammering out final details of the agenda of the 19th summit of Central American countries still recovering from Cold War-era civil wars.</p>
<p>"This summit will give us a good foothold for working toward the next century," Panama's Treasury Minister Miguel Heras told Reuters.</p>
<p>Host country Panama, at the end of the Central American isthmus and often considered the odd-man out in issues of regional integration, planned to use the summit to press its case for a separate free trade accord with its neighbours.</p>
<p>"What we are looking forward to at this presidential summit is the official launching of the free trade negotiations between Panama and Central America," Heras said.</p>
<p>Due to its unique position with a dollar-based and financial service-based economy, Panama does not presently see it in its interest to be part of a Central American free-trade zone.</p>
<p>Due to attend the summit were Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres, Honduran President Carlos Roberto Reina, Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman, El Salvador's President Armando Carderon Sol, Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu and Panamanian President Ernesto Perez Balladares.</p>
<p>Also attending as a guest was Dominican Republic President Lionel Fernandez, who wants to expand his Caribbean island's commerce with Central America. Vice Prime Minister Dean Barrow, of English-speaking Belize, was invited as an observer.</p>
<p>High on the summit agenda was the issue of regional institutions, many developed during the transition from civil wars to democracy in the early 1990s, but often lambasted as toothless and expensive talking-shops.</p>
<p>The Central American Parliament (PARLACEN) and the Central American Court of Justice (CCJ), for example, were due to come under tough scrutiny for their burden on a region of 32 million people where average per capita gross domestic product ranges from $481 in Nicaragua to $2,641 in Panama per year.</p>
<p>"We need to modernise these institutions and put them in line with modern times," said Costa Rican Foreign Ministry spokesman Luis Guillermo Solis.</p>
<p>The presidents also planned to discuss ways to foster a free-trade agreement with the United States, although Panama, following its tradition of acting alone, wants to negotiate separately with Washington.</p>
<p>"We need a Central American free-trade treaty and we want U.S. investment in the whole region," El Salvador's Calderon said last week.</p>
<p>Also on the agenda were measures to prevent money laundering and to pressure the United States into reconsidering its moves to deport illegal Central American immigrants.</p>
<p>Despite a massive security operation and large attendance the local media have virtually ignored the summit and Panama's government has done little to publicise the event.</p>
