<p>Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori insisted on Monday that the two-month Lima hostage crisis -- now Latin America's longest embassy siege -- had not knocked the country's progress off track.</p>
<p>"Despite the current difficulties .... Peru has continued its march. It has not stopped," Fujimori said in a speech during a visit to the Amazon jungle region of Loreto in northeastern Peru.</p>
<p>Fujimori has repeatedly argued that the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement's (MRTA) seizure of the Japanese ambassador's home was an isolated incident that would not set back his economic reforms or "pacification" process after nearly 17 years of guerrilla conflict.</p>
<p>Most analysts agree the economy has only been minimally affected. But political experts say the siege has shown Fujimori was premature in declaring, prior to the attack, the "death" of the MRTA and larger Shining Path guerrilla groups.</p>
<p>In Lima, Health Minister Marino Costa Bauer was less upbeat about the crisis, warning of health emergencies "at any moment" among the 72 hostages at the residence.</p>
<p>The mainly middle-aged and increasingly ailing captives have now spent 62 days under the guns of about 15 MRTA rebels since their spectacular Dec. 17 strike. Costa Bauer said in a radio interview some of the hostages in Lima required permanent, close monitoring, for which a special medical team had been set up.</p>
<p>"It is possible that emergencies might happen at any moment," he said, mentioning for special concern the cases of government legislator Gilberto Siura, former Supreme Court President Moises Pantoja "and two or three others."</p>
<p>Siura is being treated for cancer and Pantoja wrote recently to his family that he could hardly walk. "When I do, I lose my balance. My feet, hands and fingers have all gone hard. My arthritis stops me from reading and I can barely write," his message said.</p>
<p>Aid workers and police say the captives' ailments include hypertension, digestive problems, asthma and depression.</p>
<p>Despite three rounds of talks last week to set an agenda for negotiations between Fujimori's government and the MRTA, there was no end in sight on Monday to the siege.</p>
<p>The day began with the now-familiar broadcast from the residence of an MRTA revolutionary hymn commemorating fallen comrades. Half an hour later, police outside responded by blaring local "criollo" music -- with guitar rhythms and patriotic lyrics -- from loudspeakers aimed at the compound.</p>
<p>Last week's face-to-face talks at a Red Cross safe house between MRTA second-in-command Rolly Rojas and government negotiator Domingo Palermo raised hopes of a breakthrough after weeks without direct dialogue.</p>
<p>But there has been no sign of a narrowing in two apparently intractable positions -- MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa Cartolini's demand that 400 jailed comrades be freed and Fujimori's refusal to consider this.</p>
<p>"The liberation of our comrades is not negotiable," the MRTA's European-based spokesman, Isaac Velazco, told Peruvian television from Madrid late on Sunday.</p>
<p>He referred to the hostages, including Fujimori's brother, two cabinet ministers, the ambassadors of Japan and Bolivia and two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats, as "prisoners of war" and said the MRTA was respecting the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p>"Either there is an exchange of prisoners of war or there is no solution to this crisis," he said, adding that Fujimori could choose "a political solution ... or a military option."</p>
<p>According to an army intelligence memorandum obtained on Monday by Reuters, the Peruvian military has developed a plan for a commando raid on the compound to end the siege but it would likely result in heavy casualties.</p>
<p>According to the plan, U.S. and Peruvian commandos would drop onto the roof of the Japanese ambassador's home on a moonless night, plant explosives in six points and end the siege in just seven minutes. Casualties could be as high as 90 people, including three-quarters of the 72 men being held, almost all the hostage-takers, and 20 commandos, the document added.</p>
<p>The military card, therefore, should only be played if negotiations fail, said the memo, dated Feb. 5 and addressed to Armed Forces chief army Gen. Nicholas de Bari Hermoza Rios.</p>
<p>Experts speculated the military plan was leaked to spur talks aimed at peacefully ending the crisis. There was no word on when negotiations would resume.</p>
<p>Saturday's talks apparently produced nothing more than an agreement for mediators from the Vatican, Canada, the Red Cross and a Japanese observer to come up with proposals for "the continuation of the preliminary conversations."</p>
<p>In Latin America's previous longest embassy siege, Colombia's M-19 rebels held 57 hostages for 61 days at the Dominican Embassy in Bogota before taking $2 million and a plane to Cuba.</p>
