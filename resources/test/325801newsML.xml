<p>NWE gasoline edged higher with crude oil but traders awaited direction from the NYMEX after a U.S. refinery fire on Tuesday and before key weekly inventory data.</p>
<p>Traders were also closely watching the arbitrage after some gasoline was pulled out of NWE this month when U.S. prices rallied sharply.</p>
<p>An explosion and fire rocked Tosco Corp's 150,000 barrel per day Avon refinery in northern California.</p>
<p>The company said the fire was at a hydrocracker unit that makes gasoline. Some units were already down for maintenance before the fire and other units not affected by the fire were still operating, it said.</p>
<p>"The gasoline (increase on ACCESS) does not necessarily reflect the Tosco fire," cautioned one barge trader.</p>
<p>Eurograde barges rose $4 to $217/$219 fob ARA, with trades heard at $218 and $218.50. Regular unleaded rose a similar amount to $$210/$212.</p>
<p>"We've withdrawn from the market especially after news of the Japanese selling gasoline," the trader said. "We're waiting for the APIs."</p>
<p>American Petroleum Institute data was delayed one day, to later Wednesday, due to the U.S. Martin Luther King holiday.</p>
<p>Earlier, in Asia, gasoline prices fell after aggressive selling from a Japanese trader who lowered an offer for 50,000 barrels of 92-octane unleaded gasoline from $2.05 a barrel fob Singapore to $24.50.</p>
