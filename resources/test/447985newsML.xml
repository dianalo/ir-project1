<p>Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot trade unionists from divided Cyprus met on Monday to discuss the impact European Union membership would have on workers.</p>
<p>The three-day gathering, a follow-up to a first island-wide conference on a bicommunal basis two years ago, was discussing privatisation, movement of capital and labour and social policy in Europe. The conference is financed by the European Union.</p>
<p>Fifty delegates from 16 Greek and Turkish Cypriot unions are taking part. They met on Monday on the Greek Cypriot side of the capital Nicosia and will meet again on Tuesday on the Turkish Cypriot side.</p>
<p>The conference ends on Wednesday with a joint declaration.</p>
<p>"It is important to hold these kind of bicommunal contacts," said Giles Anouil, head of the E.U. Delegation to Nicosia.</p>
<p>The island has been divided since 1974 when Turkey invaded the northern third. The invasion was sparked by a brief Greek Cypriot coup backed by the military junta then ruling Greece.</p>
<p>The Greek Cypriot-led government is due to start entry negotiations with the European Union next year.</p>
