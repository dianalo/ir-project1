<p>China sparked up a market awash with sovereign issues on Thursday with its 500 million mark issue despite planned deals by Russia, Mexico and Cyprus.</p>
<p>The issue is at a spread of 55 basis points over bunds, and was lead managed by Credit Suisse First Boston and Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Traders predicted it would go well for a number of reasons.</p>
<p>"Partly, it's the mark factor. Investors really like sovereign paper in mark. Hong Kong and China are very much in with international investors in general," an analyst here said.</p>
<p>"If you want to diversify... into Asia, you're not going to buy Thailand. You're not going to buy Korea."</p>
<p>China, which had not done a mark deal in 10 years, was also expected to benefit from an upgrade by Standard&amp; Poor's in May.</p>
<p>"We are in the issue," said a Hong Kong-based banker with a European bank, which joined at co-manager level. "It's very well received. It's a fair price."</p>
<p>Another trader with another German bank said Asians were interested in more European currencies, citing recent peseta issues from the region.</p>
<p>He said his bank was regularly running roadshows on European currency to Asian clients interested in diversifying their funding base and building relationships in Europe.</p>
<p>China was not expected to swap the proceeds of the mark issue, having a requirement to maintain a certain portion of its foreign exchange reserves in marks, bankers said.</p>
<p>China's issue coincided with planned issues by Russia, Mexico and Cyprus in Europe.</p>
<p>The expected US$300 million cross-border securitisation from Dah Sing Bank, a unit of Dah Sing Financial Holdings Ltd, did not emerge on Wednesday, when it was expected.</p>
<p>Gary Wang, general manager and financial controller for Dah Sing Bank and its parent, said the briefing earlier in the month had been to meet Stock Exchange requirements.</p>
<p>The deal involved disposal of assets within a listed group, and was also a substantial transaction, so an announcement was needed for the publicly listed holding company, he said</p>
<p>He said the issue should go ahead within a couple of days.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong dollar debt market remained unusually quiet, with no one attempting last-minute issues before the market shuts down for the first three working days of the handover to China week.</p>
<p>Including the weekend, this means a five-day break.</p>
<p>"There's nothing to report," said one banker active in the Hong Kong dollar fixed-rate market.</p>
<p>PT Dharmala Intiland and a special-purpose company Netherlands-incorporated company launched a US$45 million transferable loan certificates facility.</p>
<p>The five-year loan, is guaranteed by PT Dharmala Intiland, and has a put option at the end of year fours. Its margin is 300 basis points over Singapore Interbank Offered Rate.</p>
<p>With fees, the all-in returns for top-tier managers is 328 basis points.</p>
<p>Leefung-Asco Printers Ltd, a unit of Leefung-Asco Printers Holdings Ltd (LAPH), launched a HK$160 million term loan/revolving credit facility.</p>
