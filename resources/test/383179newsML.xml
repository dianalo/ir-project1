<p>The Taiwan agency responsible for monitoring the Internet said on Monday it has cut off a domestic website that carried an address resembling that of the worldwide search vehicle provided by U.S.-based Yahoo! Inc.</p>
<p>The Institute for Information Industry said an Internet guide provided by a Taiwan company called "Szu Tung" had been using the domain name, or address, http://www.yahoo.com.tw. Yahoo!'s domain name is http://www.yahoo.com.</p>
<p>"While copyright laws recording Internet materials are still unclear, our policy is to reject any domain name that comes too close to a famous international site," an official for the institute said by telephone.</p>
<p>Yahoo is one of the world's most widely used Internet search engines.</p>
<p>She said the institute decided to terminate the address after it received a complaint from Yahoo!.</p>
