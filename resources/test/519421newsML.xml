<p>Canadian chilled pork exports to Japan are on the rise as a result of a ban on Taiwanese pork, said Jim Morris, president of Canada Pork International, an export promotion group.</p>
<p>"The tempo's picked up, but a lot of it's been on the chilled side, not frozen. There's a lot of demand that has not expressed itself yet and will sometime in the next month or two," Morris said.  </p>
<p>Japan on Thursday decided to maintain the import ban it placed on Taiwanese pork announced March 21 following the outbreak of highly contagious foot-and-mouth disease. Taiwan had supplied about 16,000 tonnes of pork a month to Japan.</p>
<p>"That has to be replaced by North American or European supplies, and the heavy betting is most of it will come from North America because we're closer," Morris said.</p>
<p>Canadian pork exports in 1996 hit a record 352,688 tonnes, up 14 percent in value at C$1.105 billion and 3.3 percent in tonnage. Canada held a 6.2 percent market share in Japan.  </p>
<p>Some 20 to 30 percent of Canadian pork sales to Japan are chilled, vacuum-packed pork shipped by ocean vessels, he said.</p>
<p>Traders at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Friday cited talk that stepped-up Canadian sales of pork to Japan had prompted some Canadian buying of CME hog and belly futures, tied to pricing or replacement buying. CME pork bellies set contract highs across the board on Friday.</p>
<p>Morris said basic fundamentals were more likely at work.</p>
<p>"Hog production is not expanding to speak of in Canada or the U.S., so that's fueling a speculative bubble on the Merc," he said.</p>
<p>Morris, also general manager of the commercial company Saskatchewan Pork International, said his firm had only bought a "half dozen" pork belly contracts on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. "It's not like there's a landslide business that I'm aware of," Morris said.</p>
