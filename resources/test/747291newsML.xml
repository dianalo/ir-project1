<title>NETHERLANDS: European feeds sapped by dollar strength.</title>

<p>Europe's physical feed trade offered soymeal a few dollars higher on Tuesday morning, after the close in Chicago but an overnight rise in the U.S. currency sapped any early buying, traders said.</p>
<p>Very nearby positions in Argentine sunmeal were reported to be very tight, based on recent consumer offtake and a lack of shipments. These positions now attracted a premium, pushing up nearby rates to $130 a tonne, against $120 further out.</p>
<p>But there were no trades reported early on.</p>
<p>"With the dollar/mark above 1.80, you can forget it," one trader commented. -- Amsterdam Newsroom +31 20 504 5000</p>
