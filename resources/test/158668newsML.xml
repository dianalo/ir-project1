<p>Shenzhen has launched a crackdown on enterprises that delay bank loan repayments for a long time, the Shenzhen-based Securities Times said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen People's Intermediate Court has punished a number of firms which had long delayed repayment and had no intention of paying and recently issued warnings to more than 40 defaulters, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Since 1996, the Shenzhen court has handled nearly 200 such cases involving more than 800 million yuan, sharply higher than in previous years, it said without giving comparative figures.</p>
<p>The sharply higher figure was due to those firms' poor management and wrong investment strategies which made them unable to repay loans on time, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Some firms spent the loans carelessly, while some officials turned a blind eye to the creditworthiness of some enterprises because they have special relationship with them, it said.</p>
<p>In October, the court settled a total of about 60 such cases involving a total of about 225 million yuan, the paper said.</p>
<p>Non-performing loans account for about 13-14 percent of total loans outstanding in China's banking system, central bank spokesman Ma Delong said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ma said about two to three percent of total loans are viewed as bad debts that would never be recovered.</p>
