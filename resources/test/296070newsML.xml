<p>Taiwan stock index futures launched in Singapore and Chicago on Thursday are expected to meet growing investor demand for hedging tools on the volatile Taiwan market, analysts and futures exchange officials said.</p>
<p>They said the contracts were likely to succeed with both Taiwanese and foreign investors despite Taiwan's ban on local investor trading in offshore futures and options.</p>
<p>"There is a very clear need for some form of hedging on the Taiwan stock market. In terms of market turnover, it's the world's sixth largest and foreign interest is rising as the government gradually liberalises foreign access," said Desmond Supple, senior emerging markets economist at I.D.E.A.</p>
<p>He said the market's volatility, a result of Taiwan's tense relations with mainland China, reinforced the need for both domestic and foreign investors to hedge their risk.</p>
<p>Taiwan, which has no local futures exchange, had greeted news of Singapore and Chicago's plans to launch the stock futures on their exchanges with distinct coolness, seeing it as pre-empting Taipei's efforts to set up its own futures infrastructure.</p>
<p>But officials of the Singapore International Monetary Exchange (SIMEX) played down the likelihood that Taiwanese regulators would exercise their threat to cut off access to stock price data crucial to the SIMEX and Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) indices.</p>
<p>"I personally really doubt that that would be a move they would really make," SIMEX president Ang Swee Tian told reporters after the contract's launch in Singapore.</p>
<p>Ang said SIMEX was still holding talks with Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission to show it was open to cooperation between the two countries.</p>
<p>Trading of the SIMEX Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Taiwan index futures and options got off to a slow start on Thursday, due largely to the absence of Taiwanese players.</p>
<p>Most dealers expressed disappointment with the first day's turnover of 500 lots and said the simultaneous launch of the CME's Taiwan stock futures and options on the GLOBEX electronic trading system had also reduced interest in the SIMEX contract.</p>
<p>"The customer base is not there because of the constraints on Taiwan investors," one foreign commission house dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said if those constraints did not exist, inaugural volume would have been healthier, often the case for any contract's first day of trade.</p>
<p>But some said they had received inquiries from Taiwanese investors and in time, investors could be tempted to skirt the ban, possibly by trading through "unofficial" offshore accounts.</p>
<p>"The initial margins are pretty low so I wouldn't be surprised if the Taiwanese are interested," said a trader at a local institution.</p>
<p>"I would expect more volume to come in as people get used to the contracts," said Richard Fan, associate director of equity trading at W.I. Carr in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Fan told Reuters Financial Television (RFTV) volume would increase as more foreign investors understood how the new contracts worked.</p>
<p>"We will definitely see more volume. I would expect to see at least 2,000 contracts trading a day within a month," he said.</p>
<p>U.S. funds, hedge funds, mutual funds, pension funds and proprietary traders would all take advantage of the futures contracts, he added.</p>
<p>Taipei brokers said local share prices had been noticeably more volatile on Thursday, clearly reflecting the launch of the offshore stock index futures.</p>
<p>But they said the impact had been weaker than expected, probably because of the restrictions on Taiwanese participation.</p>
<p>"At the very beginning, the index movement was volatile due to the addition of several new overseas indices for reference," said Jardine Fleming fund manager George Hou.</p>
<p>"But our hypersensitive local investors should get used to them pretty soon. In the long run, all price movements should return to fundamentals," he said.</p>
<p>The Taiwan weighted price index ended off 8.67 points or 0.12 percent at 7,010.76. The March contract on the SIMEX MSCI Taiwan index, ended at 307.3 against its opening of 299.7, after hitting a high of 311.0.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT, the March contract of the Dow Jones Taiwan Stock Index on GLOBEX was quoted at 172.38 against its opening of 175.10 on turnover of 502 lots.</p>
