<headline>UK utility rules to become more burdensome - Redwood.</headline>

<p>British government plans to review the regulation of utility companies are set to make rules more burdensome and restrict opportunities for profits, John Redwood, trade and industry spokesman for the opposition Conservatives, said on Monday.</p>
<p>"There would be no point in doing it unless that was their intention," Redwood told journalists.</p>
<p>He said he was particularly concerned that when Trade and Industry Secretary Margaret Beckett announced the review earlier, she said the sharing of profits above a certain level with consumers would be considered.</p>
<p>Redwood said such a system could hardly replace the existing price control mechanism under which monopoly utilities are generally required to raise prices by a specified percentage below the rise in the Retail Price Index (RPI-X).</p>
<p>If it did, there would no incentive to utilities to improve efficiency and cut costs.</p>
<p>"If Mrs Beckett is suggesting that on top of consumer protection there should also be profit sharing, she is proposing a sort of double taxation on the utilities," Redwood said. -- London Newsroom +44 171 5427767</p>
