<p>CSCE cocoa futures ended unchanged to weaker Monday, but steady speculative buying throughout the much of the day helped prices bounce back from session lows, traders said.</p>
<p>Profit taking on the heels of last week's rally to eight-year highs pushed benchmark September to a low of $1,614 a tonne, they said.</p>
<p>At the close, September stood at $1,629, up $3, after reaching a high of $1,635.</p>
<p>Rollover and long liquidation of July contract ahead of the spot month's first notice day on June 17, kept the market under some pressure, traders said. July open interest as of Friday stood at 4,821 lots, down 3,706 lots from the previous session.</p>
<p>Spot July ended $11 lower at $1,581, while the back months finished unchanged to $3 weaker.</p>
<p>Cocoa prices slumped at the opening, as the market pulled back after closing higher the last five consecutive sessions. Last week, September cocoa had surged $177 or about 12 percent on talk of a preliminary forecast for a smaller 1997/98 Ivorian crop and a developing weather pattern called El Nino, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders, however, remained skeptical, saying it was still too early to gauge the effects of El Nino and accurately predict what kind of crop the Ivory Coast would produce next year.</p>
<p>"Basically, cocoa pushed up up on the idea of the 1997/98 crop being smaller and El Nino, anticipating a tightening of stocks," said one trader. "But I don't think the tightness has materialized in any way. There's enough cocoa around in case of a real supply pinch.</p>
<p>"The market is technically strong," he added, "but I don't think the fundamentals match the technicals."</p>
<p>Some traders said that, technically, the market may still be due for a downward correction in the near-term.</p>
<p>On the charts, they pegged September support near today's low of $1,614, followed by $1,607-$1,605. The high of $1,635 should provide near-term resistance, with the next level seen at September's life-of-contract high of $1,644.</p>
<p>Volume reached an estimated 11,548 lots.</p>
