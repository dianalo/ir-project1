<headline>Vanguard suit alleges bad pricing on municipal index.</headline>

<p>Vanguard Municipal Bond Fund Inc. said Monday it filed a lawsuit against Thomson Publishing Corp. and six municipal bond brokers, alleging the fund lost at least $3.25 million as a result of incorrect pricing on the Bond Buyer Municipal Bond Index.</p>
<p>The index, which backs the municipal bond futures contract on the Chicago Board of Trade, is published by Thomson Publishing, a unit of Toronto-based Thomson Corp.</p>
<p>In the suit, Vanguard said it held 3,420 municipal futures contracts on Dec. 19, 1995. It said the brokers incorrectly priced the index that day, when the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates by a quarter percentage point and sparked a sharp reaction in the municipal bond market.</p>
<p>Vanguard alleges Thomson and the brokers, which Thomson's Bond Buyer unit uses to price its daily municipal bond index, committed breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation and violations of the Illinois consumer fraud and deceptive business practices act.</p>
<p>But Thomson officials said the suit was without merit.</p>
<p>"We followed (the Board of Trade rules), and did them accordingly, and we think the lawsuit is entirely without merit," said Michael Harris, Thomson vice president and general counsel.</p>
<p>The six brokers named in the suit were Cantor, Fitzgerald Municipal Brokers Inc.; Chapdelaine &amp; Co.; J.F. Hartfield &amp; Co.; J.J. Kenny Drake Inc.; Municipal Partners Inc., and Titus &amp; Donnelly Inc.</p>
<p>The brokers named were not available for comment.</p>
