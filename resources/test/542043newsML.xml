<p>Flamboyant Scotsman ROBERT CAMPBELL was born in 1769.</p>
<p>Campbell arrived in Sydney in 1800 and built a famous storehouse. He was arrested during the Rum Rebellion, and went to England to  testify on behalf of Captain BLIGH. He settled finally near Canberra, and his property was taken over by the Government in 1910. The land is now the site of Duntroon Military College.</p>
<p>Explorer CHARLES STURT, who named the Murray River, was born in 1795. STurt also took a boat and a sailor overland from Adelaide in search of the "Inland Sea", but all he found were a few small waterholes around Coopers Creek.</p>

Popular folklore has always claimed BLIGH's excessive cruelty started the Mutiny, but recent evidence suggests the incident was sparked more by the ambitions of     CHRISTIAN.
