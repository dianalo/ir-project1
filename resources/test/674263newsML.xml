<p>The Swiss National Bank (SNB) wants a revised Swiss Constitution to clearly spell out price stability as its primary objective.</p>
<p>SNB vice chairman Jean-Pierre Roth told a news conference that Article 39 of the constitution now states that the SNB's monetary policy should be in the "general interest of the country."</p>
<p>But in practise, Roth said price stability is recognised as the most important target for the central bank and the SNB would like that to be recognised in the constitution.</p>
<p>A working group is currently preparing a proposal for revising the articles of the constitution that deal with money and currency and Roth said he wished this group would use the opportunity to specify the tasks of the central bank.</p>
<p>The group should complete their proposal by end-July.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, a proposal should then be completed for a revision of the SNB's legal charter and the currency law.</p>
<p>Just as the Maastricht Treaty spells out that a European System of Central Banks should primarily aim at price stability, Roth said the Swiss constitution should specify that monetary policy should mainly aim for price stability and it should also support the government's general economic policy as long as this does not jeopardise price stability.</p>
<p>Work on revising the Swiss constitution has been under way since 1987, but Roth said completion is still far off and noted the new constitution also has to be approved by a referendum.</p>
<p>Last year Swiss politicians therefore decided to separate a revision of the SNB's charter from the constitutional changes.</p>
<p>This has allowed faster changes to the SNB's charter and on Wednesday the parliament approved changes that gave the SNB greater freedom to manage its reserves, including lending gold.</p>
