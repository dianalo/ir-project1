<p>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Friday told House and Senate members, who meet in conference next week to work out differences on a tax-cut deal, that neither has passed a satisfactory proposal.</p>
<p>In a letter sent late Friday to all the conferees, Rubin said tax cuts that are the centerpiece of a developing pact to balance the budget over five years had to meet basic tests that included not losing excessive revenues. They also had to foster education, help working Americans and encourage economic growth.</p>
<p>"Neither bill meets these tests," Rubin said.  </p>
<p>The eventual budget-balancing pact is to include $85 billion in net tax cuts over five years. Both the Senate and the House have passed their own version of tax cuts and the Clinton administration has its own proposal. They must now negotiate to fashion one agreed bill from the three proposals.</p>
<p>Rubin's letter to the conferees essentially was an effort to establish a position for the administration at the bargaining table before the talks got under way.</p>
<p>Rubin said the Senate's proposals were better than those passed by the House, but added "both bills provide too little tax relief to middle-income families."  </p>
<p>"In both the House and Senate bills, the middle 60 percent of families receive just one-third of the tax cuts; these families would receive twice as large a share under the President's proposals," Rubin said.</p>
<p>He called for the provision of $35 billion over five years to encourage higher education by giving a 100-percent credit for the first $1,000 of tuition and fees and 50 percent for the next $1,000 from 1998 through 2002.</p>
<p>Rubin also criticized as "too generous" proposals in the congressional bills for capital gains tax relief and said there should be a 30 percent exclusion for long-term gains.  </p>
<p>That would reduce the top tax rate on capital gains made from selling stock or other assets to 27.72 percent for taxpayers currently in the 39.6 percent bracket and lower the rate to 19.6 percent for taxpayers in the 28 percent bracket.</p>
<p>Rubin's letter offered specific criticisms of several individual proposals in the House and Senate bills, along with recommendations for change, but contained no mention of a ptoential White House veto if its views did not prevail.</p>
<p>"We remain eager to work with the Congress on a bipartisan basis to fashion, and ultimately sign, tax-cut legislation" if it meets adminsitration's standards for being fair, Rubin said.</p>
