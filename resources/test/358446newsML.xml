<p>Fernando Teixeira dos Santos, Portugal's under-secretary for finance, said he was not aware of any plan to delay the entry of Italy and other Mediterranean states to the first stage of Economic and Monetary Union.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on a Financial Times report that Italy could be offered a deal to delay its entry to the single currency, Teixeira dos Santos told Reuters: "I do not know the study in question. All I know is what I read in the press."</p>
<p>Separately, the finance ministry said in a statement: "With regard to news published today, the Portuguese government considers that the Maastricht Treaty must be applied fully."  </p>
<p>The Financial Times, quoting unnamed senior monetary officials, said Italy would be offered a deal that would delay its entry into EMU until 2000 or 2001 under a plan which could be extended to Spain and Portugal.</p>
<p>The Portuguese finance ministry statement added: "The membership of each country in the third stage of EMU can only be based on its own merits and on the objective evaluation of its ability to meet the convergence criteria defined in the treaty."</p>
<p>It said: "Portugal is firmly committed to all areas of European integration and has been constantly developing policies to consolidate its public finances."</p>
<p>It added: "We want a strong euro and we are determinedly contributing to that (aim)."</p>
