<p>Britain's London Rubber Company, the makers of the 'Durex' condom brand, is launching a three-month advertising campaign for a range of fruit-flavoured condoms, which will feature in youth-oriented magazines only.</p>
<p>The ads for strawberry, orange and banana flavoured, coloured condoms -- which use separate images of the different fruit to refer to a penis -- will run in popular British women's, men's, music and other youth interest magazines, McCann-Erickson, the ad agency behind the campaign, said on Friday.</p>
<p>Ads for other flavours and colours -- including ice tea -- will be introduced at a later date.</p>
<p>The choice of media is designed to avoid offending an'older and more conservative' readership, said Sharon Gallacher, account director at McCann-Erickson.</p>
<p>"This is not shock advertising...It is intended to be fun, topical and relevant to the age group. Shown out of context, I am sure the press ads would provoke a strong reaction," she said.</p>
<p>The drive is part of London Rubber's attempt to maintain market share in an increasingly competitive marketplace.</p>
