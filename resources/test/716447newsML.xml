<p>A woman claiming to be Bill Cosby's poor illegitimate daughter urged a top CBS executive to get the actor to pay her millions by threatening to expose him as a deadbeat dad, a prosecutor said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>During the first day of testimony in the trial of Autumn Jackson, who is accused of trying extort $40 million from Cosby, the government introduced a Jan. 16 letter the woman wrote to former CBS President Peter Lund.</p>
<p>In the letter, Jackson, 22, said she wanted to speak to both Lund and Cosby about her "undeserved and impoverished financial and living conditions" or she would expose the entertainer in a move that could hurt the ratings of his current CBS television programme.</p>
<p>She said that if Lund and Cosby could not help her, she would sell her story to the Globe supermarket tabloid. She enclosed a contract with the Globe for $25,000.</p>
<p>Jackson also said she would give other networks her story if Cosby and CBS could not provide a "fair settlement."</p>
<p>"I am quite sure that NBC, ABC and other networks will have an interest in hearing my story of desperation reaching out for my father's love," she wrote.</p>
<p>"His depicted, private and public life is very much contradictory of how he treats me," she wrote, adding that her disclosure "could undoubtedly effect your ratings negatively."</p>
<p>During opening statements, Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Engelmayer told a Manhattan federal court jury that Jackson also drafted letters to Cosby's television sponsors including Eastman Kodak and Philip Morris Cos. that portrayed Cosby as a "hypocrite" who did not deserve admiration.</p>
<p>The "scathing" letters said Cosby had refused to pay her money and that she was forced to spend last Christmas eve sleeping in a box in a public park. But Engelmayer said that in fact, Jackson and her fiance spent the evening in a hotel paid for with $3,000 Cosby had given Jackson for education.</p>
<p>"She would claim that despite his public image as a great dad, to her Bill Cosby had been a deadbeat dad," Engelmayer said.</p>
<p>He said Jackson and two accomplices "were driven by greed.</p>
<p>"They wanted to get rich quick ... The threat to Bill Cosby was simple ... your money or your reputation," he said.</p>
<p>Jackson's lawyer Robert Baum argued that there was no extortion and that his client only wanted a settlement of what she saw as her "moral and legal" rights as Cosby's daughter.</p>
<p>"It was not an intent to extort," he said.</p>
<p>He alleged Cosby paid support money to Jackson and her mother for years with the understanding they would never reveal he was Jackson's father. Because of this, Jackson believed she could never be part of Cosby's life and attempted to reach a final settlement through negotiations with Cosby's lawyer in January, Baum said.</p>
<p>He said she placed an "opening bid on the table" of $40 million. "Autumn Jackson had nothing to hide. She was doing nothing unlawful in her mind," Baum said.</p>
<p>Cosby has admitted to having had an affair with Jackson's mother but has denied being her father. According to court papers, Jackson was one of many young people whose educational expenses Cosby paid for several years.</p>
<p>Actual paternity is not an issue in the trial.</p>
<p>Jackson and the other defendants, Jose Medina, 51, and Boris Sabas, 42, were accused of conspiracy, extortion and engaging in interstate commerce to commit crimes. If convicted on all counts, they could face possible prison terms of 12 years and fines of $750,000.</p>
<p>Lawyers said the three worked out of a motel room in Burbank, Calif., where they tried to put together a children's television show called "Down on the Farm." The programme never got off the ground.</p>
<p>The extortion plot came at a tragic time for the Cosby family. The entertainer's only son, Ennis, 27, was shot to death in California on Jan. 16, two days before Jackson was charged. Authorities have said the incidents are unrelated.</p>
