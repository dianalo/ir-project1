<headline>U.S. Plains fed cattle very slow $63 - feedlots.</headline>
<text>
<p>CHICAGO, June 6  Reuter) - U.S. Plains feedlot cattle sales near midday Friday were very slow, with not enough traded to adequately test the market, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>About 400 slaughter heifers that will likely grade select and choice sold at $63.00 per cwt in the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma area following weekly movement of 131,700.</p>
<p>There were no reported sales in Kansas following record large weekly movement of 146,500.</p>
<p>The large weekly sales left most feedlots current but also provided packers with more than enough live inventories for next week, the sources said.  </p>
<p>Bids Friday were scattered at $63.00, with some packers reportedly seeking extra days to pick up the cattle, the sources said. Cattle owners were asking mostly $64.00, with a few at $65.00, they said.</p>
<p>Fed cattle prices late this week at $63.00 were down $1.00 from the bulk of cattle sold on Tuesday, down $2.00 from the bulk of last week's sales and down $3.00 from last week's top.</p>
<p>Prices next week were seen pressured by large supplies of market-ready cattle on the way and perceptions that retail beef demand would be light because retailers already had what they needed for Father's Day promotions.</p>
