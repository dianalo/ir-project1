<p>International aid officials hoped to gain access on Monday to some of up to 100,000 Rwandan refugees scattered in northeastern Zaire after rebel chief Laurent Kabila ordered their repatriation within 60 days.</p>
<p>Aldo Ajello, the European Union's special envoy to Africa's "Great Lakes" region, told Reuters he would lead the team with Filippo Grandi, the regional coordinator for the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR.</p>
<p>Ajello said the mission was part of a deal struck with Kabila during a three-hour meeting at which the guerrilla chief told the United Nations to repatriate all the Rwandan Hutu refugees remaining in Zaire.</p>
<p>"This has gone on for too long and if it is not completed we will do it ourselves," Kabila told a news conference afterwards. "I have given them 60 days to get this problem sorted out. It must be done."</p>
<p>Kabila later told Reuters that he would stick to the ultimatum and he hoped the world body would put its machinery into action.</p>
<p>Ajello said: "He (Kabila) has given us permission to visit the first few camps just outside Kisangani. I am delighted that tensions and mistrust we saw in the last few days have been cleared."</p>
<p>Aid agencies lost track of the Rwandan Hutus after they disappeared last week from makeshift camps about 35 km (20 miles) south of Kisangani.</p>
<p>Kabila denied that his forces sparked the exodus by attacking the camps and said he would seek a personal apology from U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan who described the fate of the refugees as "slow extermination."</p>
<p>"The United Nations has made promises it has not kept and Kofi Annan must come here himself to apologise," he said, adding that U.N. officials in Kisangani assured him that nothing in their reports to their headquarters should have prompted Annan's robust criticisms.</p>
<p>Kabila also said he would allow an independent investigation into alleged killings of Rwandan Hutus but he emphasised that the inquiry team must be amicably agreed upon by both parties.</p>
<p>About 50 refugees who reached Kisangani on Saturday said their camp was surrounded on Tuesday by soldiers and then attacked by villagers armed with axes and machetes.</p>
<p>Some of them were among 33 refugees who were airlifted from Kisangani to the Rwandan capital of Kigali on Sunday, the first such evacuation since U.N. officials approved an unprecedented air evacuation earlier this month.</p>
<p>Kabila said his forces knew where the bulk of the refugees were and he would help U.N. officials to locate them. "They can go now if they want," he said.</p>
<p>Some of the refugees played a prominent role in the 1994 slaughter of an estimated 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus in Rwanda and Kabila said last week that criminals among them had transported their lawlessness to Zaire.</p>
<p>More than a million Hutus fled Rwanda to escape reprisals for the genocide. Most returned in a huge wave of repatriation sparked by Kabila's sweeping rebel advance through eastern Zaire.</p>
<p>But up to 100,000 marched nearly 500 km (300 miles) west through dense jungle before being overwhelmed by hunger, exhaustion and illness just south of Kisangani.</p>
<p>Rebel authorities have blamed local hostility to the refugees on envy sparked by the sight of tonnes of food and other aid being given to them by aid organisations.</p>
