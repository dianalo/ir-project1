<p>The death of veteran union leader Fidel Velazquez could not have come at a worse time for Mexico's ruling party -- it marks the end of an era of unswerving labour loyalty just two weeks before a critical election battle.</p>
<p>Velazquez, a national figure who for more than half a century kept labour in the pocket of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), died on Saturday aged 97.</p>
<p>At the side of his coffin on Sunday in the headquarters of the 6-million-strong Confederation of Mexican Workers (CTM), President Ernesto Zedillo led his entire cabinet in homage to a man he described as "one of the most important Mexicans of this century."</p>
<p>But though Zedillo exhorted workers to maintain their "historic alliance" with the government, there was little disguising the fear that without "Don Fidel", the pro-government labour movement may become a rudderless ship.</p>
<p>"It's hugely significant that the death of Fidel Velazquez comes at a time when the political system of which he was a fundamental pillar is living through what seems to be its final hours, and when its party, the PRI, faces the most unfavourable electoral outlook in its history," centre-left La Jornada newspaper said in a front-page editorial.</p>
<p>"For better or worse, the death of the veteran leader signals the end of an era."</p>
<p>In a bid to preempt any hint of a power struggle at the CTM, Velazquez was immediately replaced after his death by 78-year-old Leornardo Rodriguez Alcaine, who will hold the post until a ballot is held next February.</p>
<p>PRI leaders assured that Rodriguez Alcaine would be capable of continuing Velazquez's mandate, which included cosy relations with business and government, and a refusal to support any labour unrest if it threatened national stability.</p>
<p>But he was considered likely to be little more than a caretaker, until a younger, more dynamic leader can be found.</p>
<p>Even before Velazquez's death, there was evidence that workers were becoming increasingly unruly, exasperated by a collapse in living standards during Mexico's 1994-5 economic crisis that compounded 15 years of falling real wages.</p>
<p>Normally docile CTM members heckled Rodriguez Alcaine when he stood in for Velazquez during a May Day ceremony. Since 1995, Velazquez had cancelled the traditional May 1 march, fearing embarrasing outbursts of unrest.</p>
<p>Velazquez, who in his waning years had a physical frailty and an almost indecipherable mumble that belied a cast-iron will, threatened CTM members with expulsion on grounds of "treason" if they backed the opposition in the July 6 polls.</p>
<p>In those elections, the PRI could lose its 68-year majority in the lower house of Congress, though opinion polls still predict it will win the largest vote.</p>
<p>In Mexico City, where for the first time in modern history elections are to be held for mayor, PRI candidate Alfredo del Mazo -- who was picked as the party runner on the nod of Velazquez -- is running a distant second in most polls.</p>
<p>Even if from the grave Don Fidel can still muster the PRI vote, commentators noted that the results -- if they do deal a blow to the PRI -- will not favour labour unity.</p>
<p>"The electoral results of July 6 could stimulate large national industrial unions to grow more independent...it's difficult to recognise in any of the heirs of Velazquez enough authority to impose order on the rest," wrote Reforma columnist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa.</p>
<p>Politics aside, Velazquez represented a link to the 1910-17 revolution in Mexico that remains the historic cornerstone of the PRI, and the bedrock of its ability to unite normally conflicting sectors of society -- labour, business and peasants -- under a common umbrella.</p>
<p>It was symbolic that as he lay in his coffin in the CTM building opposite the monolithic Monument to the Revolution, those who mostly showed up were fellow veterans of the revolutionary era in chauffeur-driven limousines.</p>
<p>Only a few hundred blue-collar workers of the younger generation paid their last respects.</p>
