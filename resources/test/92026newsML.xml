<p>Millions of dollars in bribes were paid to high-level Mexican prosecutors to protect reputed kingpin Juan Garcia Abrego's massive drug-smuggling operation, a former Mexican police commander who joined the Gulf Cartel testified on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bribes totalling $1.5 million a month were paid to Javier Coello Trejo, a deputy attorney general in charge of Mexico's anti-drug efforts, and two other officials, said Carlos Resendez, a close friend and top aide to Garcia Abrego.</p>
<p>"They would be paid for protection, to be able to work with the cocaine, so they would be able to turn the other way," Resendez told jurors in Garcia Abrego's drug-trafficking and money-laundering trial.</p>
<p>Garcia Abrego, charged with heading an illicit empire that shipped up to a third of the cocaine consumed in the United States, faces life in prison if convicted on 22 drug-related counts. He was captured Jan. 14 in Monterrey, Mexico, and flown to Houston for trial in federal court.</p>
<p>Resendez testified he tipped off police about Garcia Abrego's whereabouts and helped set up his capture. His disclosure brought a smile and a nod from Garcia Abrego, who had displayed little emotion during the two-week-long trial.</p>
<p>Resendez said he had known Garcia Abrego for 30 years and "loved him like a brother," but after a 1994 stint in a Mexican jail during which the United States tried unsuccessfully to extradite him, he said he was afraid and angry at the alleged cartel leader.</p>
<p>"Juan Garcia Abrego told me when I left jail not to be mad at him because he had abandoned me," said Resendez. "I was very afraid of landing in jail again."</p>
<p>Garcia Abrego was on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list at the time of his capture and had a $2 million bounty on his head, but Resendez denied he helped trap his friend for the money.</p>
<p>"It was for the fear, the pressure," he said.</p>
<p>Resendez, the latest in a parade of former Gulf cartel insiders to testify against the man known as "El Patron" -- The Boss -- said Garcia Abrego was hounded by police and forced into hiding -- even fleeing to Chicago briefly in 1990 -- because bribes had not been delivered to officials.</p>
<p>"They were after him. They had an arrest order for him, and the problem came because of the money, they were not seeing it," Resendez said through a translator.</p>
<p>Garcia Abrego, after returning to Monterrey in early 1991, learned that an intermediary pocketed more than $10 million in bribes sent to Coello Trejo, Resendez said.</p>
<p>Garcia Abrego, said Resendez, made a fortune in drugs and owned several ranches in Mexico where cocaine-laden planes sent by the Cali cartel in Colombia landed and from which drugs were ferried north toward the U.S.-Mexican border.</p>
<p>In May Resendez gave a statement to the Mexican Attorney General's office in which he said Garcia Abrego did not deal drugs. But Resendez testified he said that only to protect himself and his family.</p>
<p>A month later he fled to the United States and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in return for protection. Resendez said he had been told that Garcia Abrego intended to kill him, a statement which also provoked a smile from the alleged kingpin.</p>
