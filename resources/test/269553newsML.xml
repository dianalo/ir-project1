<p>Two opposing groups of global media titans have begun a battle for control of the lucrative Mexican pay-television market, making huge investments now in the hope of an even bigger return later.</p>
<p>Direct-to-home (DTH) satellite television has come to Mexico, beaming hundreds of digital-quality audio and video channels from satellites directly to customers via a pizza-sized satellite dishes.  </p>
<p>Mexico is one of the first countries after the United States with access to DTH services. Customers see hundreds of channels that have been "tropicalized" for their tastes: MTV Latino, ESPN International, HBO Ole and much more.</p>
<p>In late October, Galaxy Latin America -- headed by Hughes Communications' DirecTV International -- became the first to launch a DTH service in Mexico, offering up to 72 video and 30 audio channels.  </p>
<p>Lining up against DirecTV is a consortium of media heavyweights: Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, Mexico's Grupo Televisa SA, Brazil's Globo and U.S. cable company TCI Communications Inc. The group's joint venture is called Sky Entertainment Latin America.</p>
<p>This week, Sky launched its service, offering 60 video and 34 audio channels in several major Mexican cities just in time for Christmas. It expects nationwide service in a few months.</p>
<p>Up for grabs is a country of some 93 million people -- the world's largest Spanish-speaking market.  </p>
<p>Despite Mexico's recent economic crisis, both sides believe there is a large pool of affluent Mexicans who want more than a handful of cable television channels or the diet of soap operas and pro-government news on broadcast TV.</p>
<p>Different studies have estimated the potential market at between two million and 10 million customers by 2000.</p>
<p>"We don't give estimates because they have been unreliable in the past. ...But we are in this to make money and we believe we can," Kevin McGrath, chairman of Galaxy Latin America, said.  </p>
<p>DirecTV, together with its local partner Multivision, has hooked up about 30,000 homes in its first two months, according to estimates by the Daily Variety newspaper.</p>
<p>Both sides have already spent big bucks. Televisa estimates spending between $170 million and $200 million so far in Mexico alone. DirecTV says it will spend anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion to hook up all of Latin America.</p>
<p>Sky estimates that its break-even point at between 700,000 and 800,000 subscribers, which it plans to achieve in slightly less than three years.  </p>
<p>"This business may take awhile to turn a profit, but we are willing to wait awhile," said Jorge Alvarez, chief executive of Innova, Sky's Mexican division.</p>
<p>The package in both cases is very similar. Sky charges 3,190 pesos to be connected, compared with about 2,700 pesos for DirecTV. Both charge monthly rates of between 200 pesos and 450 pesos, depending on how many channels a customer wants.</p>
<p>Although both also offer similar packages of channels, officials at Sky said programming would eventually give its service an edge.  </p>
<p>"This is all about programming. Televisa is a programmer, so is Fox and so is Globo. We can offer everything the competition does and our own products," said Alvarez, who until recently headed up Televisa's Cablevision unit.</p>
<p>Sky recently got a boost when a potential rival, Medcom, threw in with Televisa for the DTH project. Medcom, led by former radio magnate Clemente Serna, brought seven more satellite transponders to Televisa's seven on Mexico's Solidaridad II satellite. Transponders give satellites the ability to beam more channels to the ground.  </p>
<p>Not to be outdone, DirecTV announced last week that it would launch a second satellite.</p>
