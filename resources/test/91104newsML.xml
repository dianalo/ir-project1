<p>Hong Kong's gold market recovered some of its composure on Wednesday to end a shade up from New York's Tuesday close after afternoon European buying buoyed the market, gold dealers and traders said.</p>
<p>The selling spree on Tuesday had quietened down by Wednesday as earlier producer sales, triggered by fears of a huge price slump, slowed down considerably, they said.</p>
<p>But volumes remained small and gaps between bids and offers were too unrealistic for many deals to be concluded, industry sources said.</p>
<p>"People want to buy between $378.00-378.25 and on the upside people want to offer around $379.00-379.50, so the gold market was quiet," Swiss Bank Corp's chief dealer Anderson Cheung said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong kicked off the morning with gold sales from the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) sparked by a higher dollar/yen, dealers said.</p>
<p>The afternoon saw European buying recover and gold moved steadily up to close at US$379.00/50 an ounce Wednesday against New York's US$378.70/379.20 close on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Local gold ended HK$13 higher at HK$3,495 a tael.</p>
<p>The carry over charge at the Chinese Gold and Silver Exchange Society rose to -5 from its fix at -6 on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>Demand for physical gold remained quiet with China's National Day holiday further dampening enthusiasm.</p>
<p>A slight wave of physical buying when prices approached $378 had died down by Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>Hong Kong traders saw little chance of shortcovering hitting the market, noting that shorts were comfortable and the market remained technically bearish.</p>
<p>Following the rebound in New York on Tuesday, the market would hold around $378 over the next couple of days, dealers said.</p>
