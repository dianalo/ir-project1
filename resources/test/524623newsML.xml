<p>Coconut oil prices are likely to take their cue from firmer Malaysian palm oil and Chicago futures prices this week, Manila vegetable oil traders said on Monday.</p>
<p>However, growing coconut supply from both the Philippines and Indonesia should put a cap on the rise in coconut oil prices overseas, traders said.</p>
<p>"The market may test the upside in view of the better Chicago soyoil close on Friday and the rally today in Malaysian palm oil," a senior trader in a Philippine commodity house said.</p>
<p>"We may see a $10 to $15 per tonne rise in coconut oil prices in Rotterdam," said a senior trader in a Philippine commodity house. Sellers for May/June shipment last quoted a price of $710 per tonne CIF, he added.</p>
<p>In the domestic market, copra also firmed up at 11.30 pesos per kg from last week's 11.20.</p>
<p>Coconut oil stocks in Rotterdam dropped to 21,765 tonnes on April 14 from 23,704 tonnes the previous week.</p>
<p>Traders said they do not expect fresh coconut oil arrivals in Rotterdam and the United States this week. Two vessels are currently loading 15,000 tonnes of coconut oil each from the Philippines and are expected to arrive in Rotterdam next month.</p>
<p>A Philippine commodity house said it expected exports to reach 60,000 tonnes this month from 44,000 tonnes last month.</p>
<p>Trade group United Coconut Associations of the Philippines Inc said coconut oil exports reached 36,000 tonnes between April 1 and 16 this year. Total exports in April 1996 reached 99,088 tonnes. --Dolly Aglay, 841-89-36, fax 817-62-67</p>
