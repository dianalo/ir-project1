<p>At least 12 people died and 82 were injured on Monday when one passenger train rammed another in this industrial town on the outskirts of New Delhi, officials said.</p>
<p>"According to our information, 12 people died and 82 were injured in the accident," Surendra Kumar Puri, principal medical officer at the nearby Badshah Khan hospital, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Puri said most of the injured sustained head injuries.</p>
<p>A railway police official, Deepa Mehta, had earlier put the death toll at 15.</p>
<p>N.C. Sinha, a railway manager in charge of rescue operations, said the Karnataka Express, which was running 12 hours late, had overshot a stop signal on a loop line and rammed into the slower-moving Himsagar Express.</p>
<p>Sinha said the accident occurred due to human error. He said the government had ordered an inquiry and punitive action would be taken against those found guilty.</p>
<p>Rescuers used blow torches to cut through the mangled metal of the coaches thrown off the tracks by the impact of the collision.</p>
<p>S.M. Kushalappa, an army officer, said he tried to climb out of the wrecked train after the accident but realised he had too many broken bones. "I waited and cried for help," he said.</p>
<p>Doctors said the death toll was not likely to rise. "Of the injured treated here, the condition of some is serious but only one more is critical," S. Sarup of the Badshah Khan hospital told Reuters.</p>
<p>Engineer G.R. Madan it was hoped that rail services could be fully resumed by Tuesday after clearing the site. Nearly 100 trains pass through the Faridabad station every day.</p>
<p>Railway Minister Ram Vilas Paswan expressed profound sorrow over the accident. Major political parties demanded in parliament that Paswan resign.</p>
<p>Divisional railway manager K.K. Gupta said a similar accident occurred in Faridabad in May when a passenger train overshot a red signal and crashed into a goods train. No casualties were reported.</p>
<p>The railways announced relief payments of 15,000 rupees ($420) to the families of the dead and 5,000 rupees to the seriously injured in Monday's crash.</p>
<p>The disaster was the latest to hit the accident-prone Indian railways. On Sunday one person died and 28 were injured when two coaches of a train were derailed in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.</p>
<p>Latest government figures show 594 people died in 398 accidents in 1995/96 (April-March), compared with 305 deaths in 501 accidents the previous year.</p>
<p>India's railways cover a vast network spread over 62,915 km (39,321 miles) and in 1995/96 carried 123 million passengers on long-distance journeys. Trains are the cheapest mode of transport across the huge country.</p>
<p>In August 1995, at least 350 people were killed in India's worst train accident, which occurred near the town of Ferozabad, 200 km (125 miles) from New Delhi when two trains collided. The accident was blamed on human error.</p>
