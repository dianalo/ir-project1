<p>A budding opposition to Athens' bid to host the 2004 summer Olympics has predicted an environmental, city planning and financial disaster if Greece wins the world's biggest sports festival.</p>
<p>Athens, among 11 cities vying for the Games, has prided itself on enjoying widespread public support and being spared the local opposition dogging other candidates.</p>
<p>But the newly founded Citizens Initiative Against Hosting the 2004 Olympics in Athens promised at a meeting late on Wednesday to change that, propounding a list of objections.</p>
<p>The Athens bidding committee rejected the claims on Thursday, saying they were unfounded.</p>
<p>The opposition group includes representatives of areas where major Games-related construction is planned, various professional unions and private citizens opposing the Games.</p>
<p>"We are organising a campaign against hosting the 2004 Olympics," architect Panayotis Dotsikas told Reuters. "We are collecting signatures and we are preparing an anti-bid file, which we will submit here and abroad."</p>
<p>"Our anti-bid file will include facts and arguments against hosting the Olympics as well as opinions from a wide range of groups, and will reveal all the problems in the existing bid file," Dotsikas said.</p>
<p>The group contends that construction for the Games will alter the Athens city plan, shrink the capital's precious few open spaces and force financially-strapped Greece to subsidise an event that will only profit construction firms.</p>
<p>"It is not unusual to have different views and the committee is open to any proposals," it said in a statement. "But these views are not based on the scientific facts the committee has put to various organisations and made available to the public."</p>
<p>A sprawling city of four million people, Athens was incensed that the centennial 1996 Games went to Atlanta and not the ancient birthplace of the Olympics.</p>
<p>It vowed never to bid again but soon changed its mind and decided to go for the 2004 Games by projecting an image of a modern city with state of the art facilities.</p>
<p>Work on a new $2.5 billion Athens international airport and $2.1 billion Athens subway system is scheduled to be completed by 2001. Athens already has an 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium.</p>
<p>But new motorways, an Olympic village at the foot of Mount Parnes north of Athens, a group of sports facilities at the Faliron coastal zone and a 3.5 km (two mile) long yachting centre are still to be built.</p>
<p>Environmentalists have already slammed the choice of venue for rowing and canoeing at what they say is a sensitive bird habitat at Skinias, north-east of Athens, forcing the committee to alter its plans.</p>
<p>"The bidding committee, understanding the importance of protecting the Skinias marine habitat, has designed a new orientation for the venue," the committee said in a statement.</p>
<p>Athens is considered among the top favourites along with Cape Town, Stockholm and Rome. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) will short-list four or five cities in March, before making their final choice in September.</p>
