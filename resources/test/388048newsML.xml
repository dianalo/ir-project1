<p>A Palestinian official on Wednesday said Israel's plan to build a new Jewish neighbourhood in Arab East Jerusalem, which Palestinians regard as the capital of their future state, would jeopardise the peace process.</p>
<p>Nabil Shaath, minister of planning and international cooperation in the Palestinian Authority, was referring to the Jewish state's plan to construct 6,500 Jewish homes at Jabal Abu Ghneim or Har Homa.</p>
<p>The area is a hill of pine trees between Jerusalem and Bethlehem, seized by Israel when it captured Arab East Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>"The building of a new settlement at Jabal Abu Ghneim is dangerous and will have dire consequences on the (peace) process," Shaath said after meeting Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa in Cairo.</p>
<p>"It will create an Israeli presence and is a violation of Palestinian rights in the final status of that area," he added.</p>
<p>The PLO wants East Jerusalem to be the capital of a future Palestinian state and has called Israeli housing projects an attempt to cement the Jewish state's hold over all of the city. Israel views all of Jerusalem as its capital.</p>
<p>The status of Jerusalem is to be decided along with other thorny issues -- such as Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees and shape of Palestinian-Israeli borders -- in the so-called final status talks between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO).</p>
<p>Palestinian and Israeli negotiators held a brief initial session of final status talks last May. The PLO has told Israel it expects the talks to resume next month.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu went to parliament for talks with opposition and government lawmakers on Wednesday on the plan to construct the homes.</p>
<p>Right-wing coalition partners and several members of the main opposition Labour party have been pressing Netanyahu to give the green light for the construction.</p>
<p>"The prime minister told parliament members he intends to build in all parts of Jerusalem including in the Har Homa neighbourhood," Netanyahu's spokesman said in a statement.</p>
<p>Critics said the plan would spark Palestinian rage that could prove more costly than gunbattles in which 61 Arabs and 15 Israeli soldiers died last year after Netanyahu opened a new entrance to a tunnel near Moslem holy sites in Jerusalem.</p>
