<p>German banks are granting more loans to the services sector, reflecting its rising importance at the expense of heavy industry and agriculture, the Bundesbank said in its October monthly report on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank said 40 percent of lending by large commercial banks in 1995 was directed at the services industry, compared with less than 30 percent in the mid 1980s.</p>
<p>The overall volumes of loans granted to German companies and individuals has risen 7.5 percent per year on average over the past 20 years, according to Bundesbank statistics.</p>
<p>The report noted that credit demand had accelerated in the late 1980s and early 1990s, fuelled first by a general economic upswing and then by the strong investment demand generated by German unification.</p>
<p>Credit demand rose 8.5 percent on average from 1990 through 1995, compared with a six percent average growth in the 1980s.</p>
<p>German banks' total non-bank lending volume at the end of 1995 was around 4.15 trillion marks, the report said.</p>
<p>Around three quarters of that amount was granted to German companies and individuals, 18.5 percent were public sector loans and five percent went to foreign non-banks.</p>
<p>Companies remain the most important private sector borrowers, but have declined in significance in the past 20 years and accounted for just 46.5 percent of all loans at the end of 1995 compared with 55 percent at the end of 1974.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank noted, however, that mortgage lending had increased in importance and accounted for 41 percent of loans last year compared with 36.5 percent at end-1974.</p>
<p>Consumer credits -- loans to individuals excluding mortgages -- accounted for 11.5 percent of borrowing against 7.5 percent at the end of 1974.</p>
<p>Large banks continued to focus on short term credit, mainly to corporates, while savings banks and co-operatives were relatively strong in long-term loans like mortgages.</p>
<p>However large banks had scaled back their short term corporate lending somewhat since the reunification boom, allowing small banks a greater share, which the Bundesbank said may be due to banks' fears of higher risks in company loans.</p>
