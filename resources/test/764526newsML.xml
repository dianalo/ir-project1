<p>Shipments between North and South Korea rose 25 percent in the first half of this year to $145.4 million from $116.3 million in the same period of last year, South Korean statistics showed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Ministry of National Unification said the communist North's sales of gold bars, zinc ingot and iron scrap to the South were largely responsible for an 18 percent increase in the arrival of goods.</p>
<p>South Korea bought $97.1 million worth of goods from the North in the six months, against $82.2 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Metal traders said North Korea, whose economy has shrunk in the past seven years, exported metals to earn hard currencies.</p>
<p>Shipments to the North rose a sharper 42 percent to $48.4 million in the period from $34.1 million, it said.</p>
<p>The shipments included food aid by the South Korean Red Cross to the North aimed at helping to stave off famine and donations of fuel oil by the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation (KEDO).</p>
<p>Ministry officials said the rise in the shipments to the North was due largely to the food aid and fuel oil supply but did not give exact figures. The fuel oil, financed by the United States, was purchased from South Korean companies.</p>
<p>KEDO is an international consortium, led by the United States, South Korea and Japan, responsible for building two light-water reactors in North Korea under a landmark 1994 agreement between Pyongyang and Washington.</p>
<p>Under the deal, the communist North agreed to freeze and eventually dismantle its suspected nuclear weapons programme.</p>
<p>The two Koreas are still technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace agreement.</p>
