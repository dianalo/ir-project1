<p>The Angolan government on Thursday demobilised the first 213 boy soldiers in its army under an agreement it signed with the former rebel UNITA movement in 1994 to end two decades of civil war.</p>
<p>The young soldiers, aged from 13 to 17 years, were among an estimated 1,000 in the Angolan Armed Forces (FAA) and were demobilised in a ceremony at a base in the capital Luanda.</p>
<p>Underaged soldiers who fought in UNITA's guerrilla army began demobilising at the end of last year from United Nations-run assembly camps.</p>
<p>"Once again the eternal pessimists have been proven wrong," said Alioune Blondin Beye, the United Nations special envoy to Angola overseeing implementation of the peace process, said of critics of Angola's two-year-old peace.</p>
<p>The young soldiers will be taken by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) to their homes, some in UNITA-controlled areas. All but four of the soldiers demobilised on Thursday were from Angola's provinces.</p>
<p>"I don't know exactly when I will leave for home, but I am looking forward to seeing my family," said 17-year-old Francisco Luca of the central Bie province.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to join the army, but they made me join. They came to my home one night and took me away. I was 13 years old then and ever since then I have been in the army," he added.</p>
<p>Luca, who does not read or write, said he planned to help his father farm.</p>
<p>Angolan military officials said the use of child soldiers was a "regrettable" result of the civil war, which erupted when Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.</p>
<p>"It was often the lower-level commanders who allowed this to happen," said Lieutenant-Colonel Pedro Seteco.</p>
<p>The IOM demobilisation programme director James Titelman told Reuters the soldiers would receive cash from the government and a kit from IOM containing seeds, farming tools and cooking equipment. They will be able to get food hampers from the World Food Programme after three months.</p>
<p>More underaged soldiers in the FAA are expected to be demobilised next month.</p>
