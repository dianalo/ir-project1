<p>More than 150,000 protesters demonstrated in Belgrade on Sunday and Serbian opposition leaders demanded that President Slobodan Milosevic acknowledge their victories in November local elections.</p>
<p>In a breakthrough for the opposition a court in the southern town of Nis ordered the city election commission to hand back victory won in the elections to the opposition, an official of the opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition said.</p>
<p>On the 28th straight day of street protests in Belgrade and across the country prominent Zajedno leader Zoran Djindjic vowed the daily marches would continue until Milosevic backed down in a crisis over alleged election fraud.</p>
<p>The cheerful carnival atmosphere in Belgrade, with music playing, flags waving and firework rockets shooting into the night sky, belied the serious message from Zajedno that it wanted the annulled election results reinstated.</p>
<p>"Our protests will last until Serbia becomes a legal state," Djindjic told Reuters. "Today we have been informed that elections results have been reinstated in Nis," said Djindjic, adding he hoped this trend would continue.</p>
<p>"Zajedno does not agree to re-run elections, we want the results of the elections to be verified. If new elections are called afterwards we have nothing against that," he added.</p>
<p>On Sunday a small group of students set off from Nis on a symbolic 230-km (145-mile) protest march to Belgrade to join Belgraders' protests and to try and raise their colleagues objections about the handling of elections to Milosevic.</p>
<p>In Belgrade, students were joined by trade union members in the march which grew as it snaked around the city for a rally in the central square. "Many are still joining the column of marchers," one opposition leader said.</p>
<p>Members of the crowd waved American, German and Italian flags as well as opposition flags. Belgraders switched the lights of their apartments off and on as the march passed in gestures of support.</p>
<p>Reflecting Washington's concern about the government's handling of the elections and their aftermath, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs John Kornblum was to meet Serbian opposition leaders in Geneva on Sunday.</p>
<p>Kornblum is in Geneva to take part in a meeting on Monday on refugees and other humanitarian issues in Bosnia.</p>
