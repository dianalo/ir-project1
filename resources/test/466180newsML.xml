<p>Saudi Arabia's King Faisal Foundation laid the cornerstone on Tuesday of a $950 million riyal ($253 million) al-Faisaliah Complex, formally launching what is says is the largest construction project of its kind in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Riyadh's governor Prince Salman laid the cornerstone of the project, a luxury complex which will include a five-star hotel, a shopping mall, office bloc and residential accommodation in the Olaya district in the heart of the capital Riyadh.</p>
<p>"There has never been a commercial multi-use project of this size in the Middle East" Sean Cuddihy, the foundation's director of engineering and construction, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The foundation earlier said it awarded the construction contract to the Saudi Binladen Group which beat a host of foreign and local firms to the deal.</p>
<p>Cuddihy said an agreement would be signed between Binladen and the U.S. Turner Steiner Construction Co to provide project management of the 55,000 square metre site.</p>
<p>"Construction will start immediately and will be completed early in the year 2000," said the foundation, a benevolent organisation based in Riyadh.</p>
<p>The project's financial director Yasser al-Kadi said financing would be provided through a 687 million riyal loan from the Jeddah-based Saudi National Commercial Bank (NCB), the biggest privately-owned bank in the kingdom.</p>
<p>The rest of the project would be covered by the foundation's equity, Kadi said adding that the complex would pay for itself in 10 years.</p>
<p>"The payback period is about 10 years, out of cashflow, not revenue," he said.</p>
<p>The complex will include a 32,000 square metres of office space, 100 residential flats and 26,000 square metres of retail space, Cuddihy said.</p>
<p>The project's sleek 260 metre (850 feet) Al Faisaliah Tower will be the highest building in Saudi Arabia, he added.</p>
<p>The architectural design for the complex was created by Britain's Sir Norman Foster &amp; Partners. Britain's Buro Happold provided the engineering design and is the cost consultant. Both firms in the joint venture will be providing construction management services.</p>
<p>The shopping centre would focus on top class retailers and be unique in Saudi Arabia, Cuddihy said.</p>
<p>"The foundation's intention is to bring in top of the market retailers, especially ones who have not been here before," he said.</p>
<p>He said many Saudi women now tended to go overseas to cities like Paris or New York to shop. "The prince (Foundation secretary-general Prince Bandar bin Saud) wants to make first class retail available in Riyadh,".</p>
<p>No retailers had signed up so far, he said.</p>
<p>"The marketing effort by the foundation is just about to get underway," he added.</p>
<p>Income from al-Faisaliah centre would be used to fund the King Faisal Foundation's philanthropic projects, the foundation said.</p>
<p>The centre would probably not be its last construction project.</p>
<p>"The foundation has the intention of doing further developments in Saudi Arabia," Cuddihy said.</p>
