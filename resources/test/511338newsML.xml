<p>Italy is within reach of meeting key goals laid down in the Maastricht Treaty for EMU aspirants, but said "substantial uncertainty" remained, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.</p>
<p>The Paris based organisation said in a regular survey that the lira's return to the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) last year, coupled with falling inflation, will allow a gradual reduction in interest rates.</p>
<p>"Italy is thus in a position where the achievement of the Maastricht exchange-rate, inflation and the long-term interest rate criteria is within reach," the OECD said.  </p>
<p>The group said it forecast that Italy would achieve a deficit of 3.6 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), against the three percent target limit laid down by the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p>But the report was written before Prime Minister Romano Prodi's government introduced corrective budget measures at the end of last month to slice 0.8 percentage points off the deficit/GDP ratio.</p>
<p>"With the three percent target within reach, its medium-term impact should be positive to the extent that real interest rates decline significantly and this may be expected to spur business investment and interest-sensitive spending," the OECD said.</p>
<p>However the organisation acknowledged the government faced a difficult battle getting the state accounts of heavily-indebted Italy into shape.  </p>
<p>"The task faced by macroeconomic policies is unusually demanding and, with the outcome remaining subject to considerable uncertainty, success requires a sustained policy effort, to which the government is committed," the report said.</p>
<p>It noted that to achieve the three percent goal, Italy would have to cut the deficit by more than half from 1996 levels.</p>
<p>"Such a reduction is not unprecedented among OECD economies," the report said, but added that success depended on three inter-related factors:</p>
<p>-- The full implementation of the budget measures adopted.</p>
<p>-- A hope that the economy will not suffer in the face of the above measures.</p>
<p>-- Continuing confidence in the convergence process on the part of financial markets.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the OECD said the 1997 budget "excludes the effects of recent interest rate reductions prompted by the prospect of Italy being among the initial members of EMU".</p>
<p>It added that rates on 12-month short-term bills in January stood at 6.5 percent. Government forecasts were based on the assumption that rates would be at 7.7 percent by the end of 1996, falling to 7.0 percent within a year.</p>
<p>"This implies significant interest savings," it wrote. -- Rome newsroom +396 6782501</p>
