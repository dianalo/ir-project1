<p>Germany will not meet the fiscal criteria for European Monetary Union (EMU) membership, set out in the Maastricht Treaty, in 1997, according to a magazine survey of economists.</p>
<p>The 27 senior economists from major banks forecast that Germany's budget deficit will be 3.1 percent of GDP, 0.1 percent above the three percent target for EMU membership in the Maastricht Treaty, said a survey in the magazine Boerse Online.</p>
<p>The German government's debt-to-GDP ratio could reach 61.3 percent, which is 1.3 percent above the Maastricht guideline, according to a copy of the survey made available in advance of next Thursday's publication.</p>
<p>The economists said that current levels of moderate economic growth would continue, with predominantly export-led growth rising to around 2.2 percent.</p>
<p>The outlook was for around four million jobless by year-end, a rate of around 10.5 percent.</p>
<p>Economists forecast a slight increase in leading interest rates and in bond yields, while the dollar was forecast to trade around its current level of 1.55 marks, the survey said.</p>
