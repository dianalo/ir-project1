<p>Following is the China Interbank Offered Rate (CHIBOR) for Tuesday issued by the official Xinhua news agency on behalf of the People's Bank of China, the central bank.</p>
<p>The figures represent weighted averages and not closing prices and are annual percentage rates.</p>
<p>		1DAY   7DAY  20DAY   30DAY  60DAY  90DAY  120DAY</p>
<p> TUESDAY   10.834 11.509 11.160 11.144  11.321 11.609 11.671</p>
<p> MONDAY    11.283 11.774 12.060 11.227  11.445 11.595 11.890</p>
<p>Turnover surged to 3.75 billion yuan from 1.607 billion yuan on Monday with the seven-day contract the most active.  </p>
<p>"The new issues and listings on the domestic A share market today were the key factors for the surge in volume," one local trader said.</p>
<p>One company issued shares and two listed on the A share market.</p>
<p>Traders said continued gains on the A shares seemed to be another factor support rates, especially the early-maturing contracts.</p>
<p>Shanghai's A share index rose 4.477 points or 0.37 percent to 1,217.230 points on volume of 977.8 million shares worth 11.9 billion yuan.  </p>
<p>But if the A share index cannot maintain its upward trend, the rates for early-maturing contracts are likely to face a correction in the next few days, traders said.</p>
<p>The gap between the interbank rates and the repo rates will encourage more non-banking financial institutions to enter the interbank market if the repo rates continue to move at high levels over the next few days, they said.</p>
