<p>Malaysia's late car tycoon Yahaya Ahmad made world headlines when he bought British sports car maker Group Lotus Ltd last year for 51 million sterling.</p>
<p>But even before he came on the world stage, the respected 50-year-old businessman captured the imagination of the Malaysian corporate world when he engineered the 1995 privatisation of national carmaker Perusahaan Otomobil Nasional Bhd (Proton).</p>
<p>That same community was stunned on Tuesday to learn that multimillionaire Yahaya and his wife Rohana Othman were among three people who died when a helicopter crashed in eastern Pahang state late on Monday night.</p>
<p>The couple had four children.</p>
<p>To some extent, Yahaya was the embodiment of Malaysia's newly found confidence as an industrialising power and an example of the rising class of successful Malay businessmen.</p>
<p>Yahaya engineered a 1.7 billion ringgit ($685 million) complex buy-out of 32 percent of Proton's parent Hicom Holdings Bhd, a heavy industrial group, from the government. It was widely seen as a corporate coup as other suitors were waiting in the wings.</p>
<p>Yahaya shuffled the assets of Proton and Hicom and his own stable of vehicle-linked firms, including Diversified Resources Bhd (DRB), and called the controlling company DRB-Hicom.</p>
<p>The bespectacled, slight-framed automotive engineer, dubbed the "car czar" in Malaysia, virtually controlled the domestic transport business through the restructured DRB-Hicom.</p>
<p>Apart from the popular Proton cars, his companies controlled vehicle assemblers and a plant that turns out Malaysia's homemade motorcycle, the Kriss. His empire also includes EON Bank Bhd, EON Finance Bhd and Gadek Capital Bhd.</p>
<p>Yahaya's companies also run Kuala Lumpur's main bus firm, Intrakota, and he created a stir locally in January when he plied Kuala Lumpur's streets on a Kriss motorcycle to personally check out complaints about poor bus service.</p>
<p>His transport empire also included aviation interests. Hicom recently launched domestic airline AirAsia.</p>
<p>The breadth of his empire was evident on Tuesday, as the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange suspended trading in nine of his company stocks following news of his death.</p>
<p>The Lotus buyout by Yahaya was hailed by industry experts as a bold move by Proton to gain control of the British carmaker's engineering expertise. Analysts said cash-strapped Lotus benefited from the acquisition.</p>
<p>Yahaya, a product of the prestigious Malay College Kuala Kangsar in northern Perak state, rose from humble village beginnings to the upper echelons of Malaysia's newly rich Bumiputera (ethnic Malay) class.</p>
<p>Among his classmates at the college were Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.</p>
<p>His foray into cars started as a salesman for former motor company Wearnes Brothers, which distributed Jaguar cars. He left Wearnes to start Automotive Corp of Malaysia in 1979, which holds the franchise to assemble Isuzu passenger cars and trucks.</p>
