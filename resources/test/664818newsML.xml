<p>British Aerospace Plc's Australian subsidiary will supply Canada with equipment for its Nulka naval missile decoy system, the company said on Monday.</p>
<p>"Under a contract signed June 5, British Aerospace Australia will supply Nulka Fire Control Systems and launchers to the Canadian navy, for its Iroquois Class destroyers," British Aerospace Australia said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Australian Nulka system fires hovering rockets that lure anti-ship missiles away from their target ship.  </p>
<p>The company said it expected to sign a multi-million dollar contract to provide Nulka decoy rounds to Canada, Australia and the United States soon.</p>
<p>The Nulka programme originated in Australia and was developed by British Aerospace Australia in a joint venture for the Australian and United States navies.</p>
<p>The fire control systems feature touch screen panels produced by Computer Devices Canada. The company said the lightweight launchers each held four Nulka decoys.  </p>
<p>The Royal Australian Navy purchased the control systems and launchers under a A$58 million contract last August to mount on its FFG-7 and ANZAC class ships.</p>
