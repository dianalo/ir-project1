<p>Israelis for and against Benjamin Netanyahu's hardline government have had the same four words on their lips since violence erupted in the West Bank and Gaza: "I told you so".</p>
<p>Right-wingers say clashes between Israeli troops and Palestinian police that claimed 73 lives proved the bankruptcy of peace deals with the PLO while leftists blame the bloodshed on Netanyahu's foot-dragging on the deals.</p>
<p>His popularity in opinion polls has suffered only slightly from the unrest and his government appears stable enough to withstand demonstrations at home, American pressure and even economic decline.</p>
<p>"We kept warning not to give them (Palestinian police) guns. The people who gave them guns didn't think they would be used against Israeli soldiers and settlers," said settler leader Aharon Domb as Israelis and Palestinians were set to resume peace talks on Sunday for the first time since the clashes.</p>
<p>His remarks reflected the thinking of about half the population in a country deeply polarised over buzz words such as "peace" and "security".</p>
<p>Instead of causing a shift in public opinion, the unprecedented clashes, touched off when Israel opened a second entrance to an archaeological tunnel in a religiously sensitive quarter of Jerusalem's Old City, appear to have entrenched Israelis further in their own diverging positions.</p>
<p>"I knew all along that if there's no progress in the talks with the Palestinians, the territories (West Bank and Gaza) would explode. I just didn't think it would happen so soon after elections," said Yael Kopelman, 32, an activist in Israel's main peace group Peace Now.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's "Peace and Security" election mantra struck a chord at a time when Israelis were receptive to such tough talk. He was elected three months after a wave of Islamic suicide bombings killed 59 people in the Jewish state and shellshocked much of the population, ousting Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shimon Peres by less than 30,000 votes.</p>
<p>Four months later, peace moves with the Palestinians are in crisis, talks with Syria are a distant memory and relations with Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace deal with Israel in 1979, are at their lowest ebb in years.</p>
<p>But support for Netanyahu has hardly been affected.</p>
<p>A week after the clashes erupted, when 15 Israeli soldiers had already died, 43 percent of those questioned in a Shvakim Panorama poll said they were satisfied with the way Netanyahu was handling the situation.</p>
<p>Israeli governments have fallen over much less. If Netanyahu survived this, analysts said, he could survive anything.</p>
<p>"This week of all times it became clear to us that there is nothing more stable in this unstable region than Netanyahu's government," wrote political commentator Hana Kim in the newspaper Haaretz this week.</p>
<p>Netanyahu's coalition owns 66 of parliament's 120 seats and has the support of two additional far-right legislators who are not in the government. By contrast, Peres's former Labour coalition included only 56 parliament members and relied on the support of five legislators from Arab-dominated parties for its survival.</p>
<p>Labour could muster only the slimmest of margins on key votes. Its 1994 peace deal with the PLO known as Oslo 2 was ratified in parliament by just a 61-59 majority.</p>
<p>Toppling the government and forcing new elections requires support from at least 61 members of parliament.</p>
<p>None of Netanyahu's coalition partners, including the more dovish ultra-Orthodox Shas party, has been ruffled by the prime minister's handling of peace talks. None has even hinted at a coalition crisis.</p>
<p>But that could change if more Israelis felt the impact of Netanyahu's policies in their pocketbooks. The Tel Aviv stock market has fallen sharply since the violence erupted in the West Bank and Gaza and activity of foreign investors -- a key to years of robust economic growth -- has dropped noticeably in the market since Netanyahu was elected.</p>
<p>Economic analysts have stressed that political stability is a condition for maintaining the level of growth Israel has experienced since its landmark 1993 peace deal with the PLO.</p>
<p>"It's early to say what effect the clashes will have on the mood of foreign investors although the effect on tourism, for instance, is immediate," said investment manager Yoram Gabai, a former senior treasury official.</p>
<p>Asked to put himself in the shoes of foreign investors, Gabai said: "I would sit tight for a while and wait. I would just wait to see how things unfold."</p>
