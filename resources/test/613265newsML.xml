<p>American teenager Venus Williams, seen by many as a future star, made a promising French Open debut by taming Japanese Naoko Sawamatsu after a tough battle on Monday.</p>
<p>On her first appearance in a grand slam tournament, the 16-year-old Williams mixed brilliant shots with clumsy unforced errors before winning 6-2 6-7 7-5.</p>
<p>She impressed first of all with her looks, resplendent in a shiny, metal-grey outfit with strings of white beads in her hair.</p>
<p>Her game in the first few sets was just as pleasant to look at as she built a 4-0 lead before wrapping up the first set 6-2 in 37 minutes.</p>
<p>But she then showed she still needed time to adapt to slow surfaces by letting Sawamatsu, ranked 45th in the world and 45 places above her, fight her way back.</p>
<p>The brave, petite Japanese forced a tie break which she won 7-2 to take the second set.</p>
<p>The decider was a close affair with Williams eventually breaking her opponent to open up a 6-5 lead. She then served for the match and Sawamatsu obligingly hit a backhand wide on the second match point.</p>
<p>The match lasted two hours and 37 minutes under stifling heat but Williams did not look tired. She stood most of the time between the games, using her chair only twice.</p>
<p>Williams said: "I had never played on the red clay before and I thought I would play a lot worse, be more erratic. I stayed calm and I never gave up."</p>
<p>Sawamatsu, who received treatment for a blister on her right foot before the very last game, said: "I knew how good she was and I knew what to expect but she's also mentally very strong and that surprised me."</p>
<p>Williams, looking cool and relaxed at the post-match press conference, said she felt no pressure.</p>
<p>"It's just like another tournament, you still run, you still sweat and you still have to win matches," she said.</p>
<p>"The difference is that everybody wants to win even more -- and that lots of people around you speak French. Obviously, I want to win the tournament like everybody else but I know I must be ready for matches even tougher than today's."</p>
