<headline>Morris resignation cost Clinton some support - poll.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-08-31</dateline>
<text>
<p>Nearly a quarter of U.S. voters surveyed said they were less likely to vote for President Bill Clinton following the resignation of his top campaign advisor Dick Morris, a poll released on Saturday said.</p>
<p>Morris quit the campaign on Wednesday after a sensationalist supermarket tabloid reported he had a year-long affair with a prostitute and had confided White House secrets to her.</p>
<p>The latest Newsweek poll conducted on Aug. 29 found 24 percent of 401 respondents "less likely" to vote for Clinton because of the Morris resignation.</p>
<p>However, among those who described themselves as Clinton supporters, just 6 percent said the resignation made them less likely to vote for the president in his bid for re-election this November.</p>
<p>Among all voters, 27 percent said the resignation made them doubt Clinton or the Democratic Party's commitment to family values.</p>
<p>The margin of error on these questions was 5 percent.</p>
<p>Also on Saturday, the Washington Post reported that Clinton-Gore campaign will examine thousands of dollars of expense account payments to Morris to ensure the campaign did not pay any expenses related to his alleged affair with the prostitute.</p>
<p>In a wider Newsweek sample of 862 registered voters taken Aug. 28-29, 54 percent said they would vote for Clinton if the election were held today, compared to 33 percent fo Republican nominee Bob Dole and 5 percent for Texan billionaire Ross Perot. That question had a 4 percent margin of error.</p>
<p>A week prior, just before the Democratic convention, 47 percent supported Clinton, 40 percent supported Dole, and 7 percent favoured Perot.</p>
