<p>Foilmark Inc said Wednesday it advised A.D. Tech it sees no reason to discuss A.D. Tech's unsolicited takeover offer for the company.</p>
<p>Foilmark said its decision was based upon an evaluation of the available public information relating to A.D. Tech and the recommendations of its advisors.</p>
<p>Last week Foilmark received an unsolicited takeover offer by A.D. Tech, and said it would consider its merits. Specific terms of the proposed deal, which would have been for cash and stock, were not disclosed.</p>
<p>A.D. Tech said the offer represented a premium to Foilmark's share price, which was 4-1/8 at the close of the market on May 13.  The stock closed at the same price May 20.</p>
<p>Foilmark makes products used to apply metallic, pigmented, holographic foils and ink decorations to book covers, wine labels, paper and plastic packages, home appliances and electronic goods.</p>
<p>Ad Tech commercializes new technologies and products related to thin film, coatings, dielectric film and vapor depositions.</p>
