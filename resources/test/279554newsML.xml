<headline>Israel ports shut as union calls for general strike.</headline>

<p>Israel's labour federation shut down ports and called for a national strike on Sunday following the arrest of a labour official.</p>
<p>"At this moment I have ordered the closing of all the ports, all the railways and all workers in the State of Israel are called on to leave their workplaces so long as (trade union division chief) Shlomo Shani is held here," Amir Peretz, chairman of the Histadrut labour federation, told Israel radio from a police station near Haifa.</p>
<p>The action came after police arrested trade union chief Shani for failing to appear before a Tel Aviv labour court in connection with a series of labour actions that began last Thursday.</p>
<p>The Histadrut had intended to strike seaports on Sunday but called for a general strike after Shani's arrest.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Ports and Railways Authority confirmed workers walked out, but a spokesman for the Airports Authority said workers had not yet received formal notice of a work action. Electricity and water workers went on reduced schedules.</p>
<p>The Histadrut began a series of strikes last week to protest against cuts in government spending that union leaders said targetted the poor.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted worker actions on Friday as politically motivated.</p>
<p>A Histadrut spokeswoman said Sunday's strikes were targetted at ports, railways, airports and the telephone company, as well as the national airline El Al.</p>
<p>The spokeswoman said Shani had intended to appear in court on Sunday and said his arrest was just for show. She said the strike would continue until his release.</p>
<p>Leaders of the labour federation had said strikes were planned in other sectors in coming days and threatened a general strike on Tuesday when parliament is to vote on the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>The government's 1997 budget proposal includes seven billion shekels ($2.15 billion) in spending cuts and new taxes and other revenue measures that Netanyhau said are needed to rein in the deficit. Union leaders say the measures will erode workers' salaries.</p>
<p>The budget must be passed in parliament by the end of the month.</p>
