<p>Men in the Afghan village of Estalef lifted stones and shovelled dirt as they set about restoring the Hazret Bilal mosque on Monday while intermittent shelling growled in the valley below.</p>
<p>It was during the Soviet invasion that Russian soldiers destroyed the mosque, set among Estalef's narrow stone and mud-walled streets which are built on the foothills of the Paghman mountains, some 60 km (40 miles) north of the capital Kabul.</p>
<p>"Whether there is fighting or not, we have to build the mosque as we need a place to pray," said one of the workmen, 55-year-old Abdul Mohammed Qasob. "If we wait for peace to build the mosque, we'll wait all our lives."</p>
<p>In the valley below the village, hidden behind yellow-leafed poplars and tall pines, forces loyal to the former Afghan government are trying to dislodge the radical Islamic Taleban militia from Kabul but are stuck at two passes north of the capital.</p>
<p>The Taleban seized Kabul at the end of last month, placing over two-thirds of the war-torn country in its hands.</p>
<p>"There won't be peace for a long time in Afghanistan," said Zabet Zaher, 44, with a shrug as he helped work on the mosque.</p>
<p>The Taleban held the village for a few days before being driven out by Masood's troops, their fundamentalist brand of Islam unwelcome.</p>
<p>Women in long blue veils moved like agitated ghosts through the streets with wide-eyed children clutching their shirt tails.</p>
<p>Stalls on the main street sold pulses, soaps, rice, spices and pottery. On one, a live, plump partridge hung for sale in a wicker cage.</p>
<p>"The war makes everything more expensive," complained one stallholder, 45-year-old Malang (one name). "And with all the soldiers here, there's a shortage of flour (for bread)."</p>
<p>Afghanistan's population of 17 million have known nothing but war for 18 years. The spectacular mountains and valleys are littered with lethal landmines, which have already killed or maimed some 400,000 Afghans.</p>
<p>The whine of a Soviet-built Antonov transport plane belonging to the Taleban broke the afternoon quiet as it wheeled high above the village, the October sun glinting silver off the fuselage.</p>
<p>Seconds later, the aircraft's bombs smashed into the mountainside around two kilometres (1.2 miles) to the south.</p>
<p>Fighters under the command of the former government's military chief, Ahmad Shah Masood, watched the aircraft helplessly from their base in a mountain guesthouse that once belonged to the Afghan monarchy.</p>
<p>It was too high for their anti-aircraft gun, propped up amid an untended garden of cream roses and red geraniums, so they went back to cleaning their assault rifles.</p>
<p>Abdul Rafur, 39 and a commander at the guesthouse, has been fighting ever since the Soviets invaded in 1979. "In the beginning we accepted the Taleban but they are just using Islam for their own ends," he said. "We will be successful as our way is true," he said.</p>
