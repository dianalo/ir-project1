<p>State-run South African Airways  SAA.CN and the aviation technicians and engineers union have agreed to enter into mediation to resolve a 10-day wage dispute, SAA said on Friday.</p>
<p>"Following a meeting between South African Airways and the SAAEAU (South African Aviation Engineering and Allied workers Union)...both parties have agreed to enter into a process of mediation to resolve the current wage dispute," SAA said in a statement.</p>
<p>SAA said both parties had scheduled a meeting for Saturday to bring an end to the industrial action and the enforcement of the lock-out.</p>
<p>The airline said it would continue with its revised timetables for Saturday and Sunday which constituted approximately 60 percent of normal published flights.</p>
<p>The 2,200-strong union has declared a dispute with SAA because of its refusal to offer a 25 percent wage rise. Management is offering a 10 percent increase plus a 20 percent productivity bonus.</p>
<p>SAAEAU suspended a work-to rule protest action on Tuesday afternoon on condition that mediation was resumed. SAA refused and locked out about 1,800 union members on Wednesday.</p>
<p>SAA said the go-slow and lock-out had cost it over 40 million rand ($8.8 million).</p>
