<p>British catering equipment and home improvement group Berisford International Plc confirmed that a possible bid approach for the company, drawn to shareholders attention last week, had come to nothing and would not progress. A statement dated Friday but distributed on Monday, confirmed weekend press reports. Berisford's directors said "that they have this evening been notifed that the part which had previously expressed preliminary interst in making an offer for the company does not now intend to put forward a proposal."</p>
<p>It added that, after this ending of uncertainty, the firm would be able to get on with a planned loan stock buyback plan.  </p>
<p>"Berisford will announce shortly the terms of the previously announced programme to purchase a proportion of the company's outstanding 5.0 percent convertible unsecured loan stock," the statement added.</p>
<p>It quoted company chairman John Sclater as saying, "We are pleased that the period of uncertainty created by the expression of interest has now ended. This allows us to get on with our loan stock buyback programme".</p>
<p>Analysts had seen a potential value for the company of between 300 and 365 million stg, at a bid price in a range of 175 to 200 pence per share.</p>
<p>The company's shares closed on Friday at 144 pence.</p>
<p>Manufacturing companies Tomkins Plc and Wassal Plc had been among the possible contenders identified by the market, with Swedish white goods giant Electrolux also named in the market as a feasible suitor.</p>
<p>Berisford made no comment on the identity in its statement.</p>
