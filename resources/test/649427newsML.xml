<p>Croatian oil concern INA and China's Sinochem will boost cooperation by launching joint oil exploration and production operations in third countries, state agency HINA said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Sinochem and INA are about to begin research and oil production in Russia," INA's chief executive officer, Davor Stern told the agency.</p>
<p>The two companies are scheduled to sign an agreement on Wednesday to expand cooperation which began in 1984 and continued throughout the war in former Yugoslavia when Sinochem was Croatia's main supplier of crude oil.</p>
<p>"This year we are going to purchase 2.5 million tonnes of oil from Sinochem, which is more than 50 percent of Croatia's needs," said Stern.</p>
<p>A visiting Chinese delegation met Prime Minister Zlatko Matesa who said Croatia was keen to strengthen economic cooperation with China, a country with which it has good political relations. -- Metka Jelenc, Zagreb Newsroom, 385 1 4557075</p>
