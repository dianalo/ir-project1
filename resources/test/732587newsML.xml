<p>The American Bankers Association (ABA) said it would ask the Federal Reserve to reconsider its petition to expand money market deposit accounts for commercial entities.</p>
<p>On July 10, the Fed denied ABA's request to allow for-profit businesses as many as 24 money market deposit account transactions per month, up from the current maximum of six.  </p>
<p>"There are a lot of small businesses that cannot have interest on their checking accounts," said Jim McLaughlin, ABA director of regulatory and trust affairs. The current six-transaction limit makes money market deposit accounts impractical for them, he said.</p>
<p>The limit turns small businesses away from their local banks and toward mutual fund money market accounts, where different regulations apply, he said.</p>
<p>In his response to the ABA petition, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said increasing the number of allowed transactions to 24 would conflict with the Glass-Steagall Act's prohibition of interest payments on demand deposits.</p>
<p>"We recognize that the prohibition puts depository institutions at a competitive disadvantage and fosters a wasteful use of resources to circumvent it," Greenspan said.</p>
<p>"Instead of taking regulatory action that would circumvent the law, we believe that a statutory change would be more appropriate," he added.</p>
