<p>Oxford Health Plans Inc said on Wednesday enrollment in the health maintenance organization's plans stood at 1.44 million at the end of the third quarter, up 57 percent over the level at last year's third quarter.</p>
<p>The total has grown to about 1.5 million in November, the company said in a statement with its earnings.</p>
<p>Oxford reported third quarter earnings of $0.33 a share, up from $0.21 a year ago. Wall Street consensus for the third quarter profits was for $0.31 a share, according to First Call. Oxford's shares were up 1-1/8 to 48 in early trading.  </p>
<p>Oxford said its medical-loss ratio, a ratio of revenue spend on direct medical costs for members, stood at 80.2 percent at the third quarter, up from 78.1 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>Administrative expenses were 15.4 percent of operating revenue for the third quarter, compared with 18.0 percent for the third quarter of 1995 and 18.7 percent for full-year 1995.</p>
<p>"Favorable medical cost trends and a continued reduction in the ratio of administrative expenses to operating revenues in the third quarter contributed to a 10 percent improvement in operating margins compared to the second quarter of 1996," said Stephen Wiggins, Oxford's chief executive officer.</p>
