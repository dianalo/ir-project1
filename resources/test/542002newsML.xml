<p>The Russian government's economy chief, Anatoly Chubais, suggested on Sunday the 1998 budget deficit could be limited to debt service costs leaving it at two percent of gross domestic product, Interfax news agency said.</p>
<p>First Deputy Prime Minister Chubais was quoted as telling journalists on his flight from Moscow to the International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that, in his personal view, 1998 budget revenues could be set at 15 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>He was considering a plan by which "the budget deficit will be completely confined to debt servicing expenses," he said. "That means that budget expenditures should be 17 percent of GDP." That would leave the deficit at two percent of GDP.</p>
<p>In the 1997 budget, the deficit for the current year is targeted at 3.85 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Chubais also said he was firmly opposed to suggestions the government should forgive massive tax and other debts owing to it, saying it would have a "powerful anti-stimulative effect on the whole economy."</p>
<p>He said the government was in favour of its debtors restructuring their obligations or offering assets instead of cash repayment but firmly against debt forgiveness.</p>
