<p>Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori on Tuesday decried "terrorist blackmail" by Marxist guerrillas holding 74 hostages at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima but pledged to stand firm and avoid bloodshed.</p>
<p>"We maintain a firm position of not giving in to blackmail from the terrorists," Fujimori told reporters during a surprise visit to a Lima shantytown.</p>
<p>But he said he hoped for a peaceful solution to the three- week-old crisis and said the "physical well-being" of the hostages was assured "because there are not going to be acts of blood."</p>
<p>Fujimori, who had ended his regular visits to shantytowns when the crisis began, said his trip was intended to show the world that life continued as normal in Peru despite the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement's (MRTA) takeover of the residence. "We should not transmit the image that in Peru we are living a situation of terrorism," he said.</p>
<p>Asked for his current stand in the crisis, he said: "A mixture of firmness in our position -- and in this sense the non-liberation of MRTA prisoners -- and at the same time prudence." The rebels demanded from the outset that the government free all of their roughly 400 jailed comrades.</p>
<p>During a tour of the city's outskirts, Fujimori also visited a jail, passing by a wing holding MRTA members.</p>
<p>Fujimori's Prime Minister Alberto Pandolfi, in a statement, said the government would "continue in a timely way unofficial attempts towards reaching a global solution to the problem" through Education Minister Domingo Palermo. He gave no details.</p>
<p>Around 3 p.m. (2000 GMT), a reporter and his interpeter working for a subsidiary of Japanese television station Asahi entered the residence at the invitation of the MRTA after sneaking into the compound through an adjoining house.</p>
<p>They left about two hours later, only to be arrested and driven away by anti-terrorism police to their headquarters in downtown Lima, where their notebooks and camera were confiscated. Asahi TV named them as Peruvian interpreter Victor Borja and New York-based reporter Tsuyoshi Hitomi.</p>
<p>Their entry into the residence, as well as that on New Year's Eve by a bigger group of journalists, was condemned by Pandolfi as "damaging to the seriousness and fluidity of talks."</p>
<p>Japanese diplomats in Lima also criticised them, saying their action was "extremely deplorable."</p>
<p>Earlier, an MRTA fighter fired two gunshots into the air shortly before dawn, shattering the edgy peace around the residence in the upscale San Isidro district. Two guerrillas slipped out of the building toward cars in the driveway, then fired a warning salvo as they went back inside, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Reuters Television images filmed from a vantage point above the residence showed a man dressed in combat gear and carrying an automatic rifle running across the driveway at the front of the compound shortly before the explosions.</p>
<p>"I think the guerrillas were trying to get one of the car batteries but they made a noise and decided to abort the operation, firing a couple of shots after they reached the house again," Reuters cameraman Carlos Valdez said.</p>
<p>Police surrounding the residence moved to a state of alert and speculated the MRTA was trying to make its presence felt. "We think it was a psychological tactic to let us know that they're there," one policeman said.</p>
<p>Red Cross spokesman Jean-Pierre Sharer later confirmed the shots were outside the house and there were no injuries to the hostages, who spent the morning writing letters to families.</p>
<p>The explosions underscored the delicately balanced nature of the crisis, which began on December 17 when about 20 heavily armed MRTA rebels stormed a cocktail party at the residence and took more than 500 guests hostage.</p>
<p>Fujimori held a 10-hour cabinet meeting overnight with ministers. He has not sent Palermo back to the residence after the first face-to-face negotiations with the MRTA on December 28.</p>
<p>The series of hostage releases in which the guerrillas have freed a total of more than 430 captives has stopped since seven were let out on January 1, and an MRTA spokesman said (on) Monday they would continue to hold firm until the two sides sat down to negotiate.</p>
<p>The rebels, who possess automatic rifles and grenade launchers, mined and booby-trapped the residence in anticipation of an assault by government forces.</p>
<p>A report by local radio on Tuesday said security forces in the central jungle captured an MRTA "military leader" but this could not be confirmed with police.</p>
<p>Carlos Dario Perez was detained in the Chanchamayo Valley, a zone 220 miles (350 km) east of Lima, where the MRTA was thought to have bases, according to Cadena Peruana de Noticias radio. It gave no other details.</p>
