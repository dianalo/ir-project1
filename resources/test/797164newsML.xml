<p>Royal Bank of Scotland said Wednesday it agreed to buy one of Britain's biggest mortgage lenders, Birmingham Midshires, for 605 million to 630 million pounds ($956 million to $995 million).</p>
<p>The bank said the deal would make it Britain's tenth-largest mortgage lender managing residential mortgage assets of 12 billion pounds ($18.9 billion).</p>
<p>It said the acquisition, expected to be completed in the second half of 1998, would have a neutral effect on earnings per share in the first year and be earnings enhancing thereafter.</p>
<p>Royal Bank planned to finance the acquisition without recourse to an equity issue to shareholders.</p>
<p>"The deal creates many new business opportunities, building on the respective skills and product expertise of each organization," Royal Bank Chief Executive George Mathewson said in a statement.</p>
<p>Birmingham Midshires agreed to the deal after a strategic review of its options following the flotation of some of Britain's biggest mutually held mortgage lenders, known here as building societies.</p>
<p>Birmingham will operate as a separate business within Royal Bank, with existing management in place for at least three years after completion of the deal.</p>
<p>Birmingham Midshires, with branches concentrated in central, northwest and southwest England, had residential mortgage assets under management of 6.1 billion pounds ($9.6 billion) and retail deposits of 4.5 billion ($7.1 billion) at the end of 1996.</p>
