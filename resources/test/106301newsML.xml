<p>Irish government bonds firmed in moderate trade on Wednesday as gains by other European markets pulled prices higher, dealers said.</p>
<p>"European markets opened strong on Wednesday morning and Dublin followed suit. I think's its more a case of the Irish market being marked up rather than being bid up. There's still a lot of hesitancy among investors in the Irish market," one dealer said.</p>
<p>By 1515 GMT the eight percent bond due 2000 was up 24p at 107.34 to yield 5.82 percent while the eight percent bond due 2006 was 45p stronger at 108.30 to yield 6.70 percent.  </p>
<p>"There has been evidence all week of investors sitting on the fence and waiting for economic factors to influence trading. It has been a quiet week so far in the Dublin market," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Earlier, UK gilts eased off their morning highs after minutes from the September monetary meeting showed that Bank of England governor Eddie George's expressed a preference for tighter monetary policy, but Chancellor Kenneth Clarke disagreed. In German markets, speculation of a possible repo rate cut at Thursday's Bundesbank meeting boosted Bund buying and this helped pull up bond prices in Dublin,dealers said.</p>
<p>Economists polled by Reuters this week were unanimous in their prediction that the Bundesbank would leave the repo rate unchanged at 3.00 percent.</p>
