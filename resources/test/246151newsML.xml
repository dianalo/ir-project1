<p>Deputies from Argentina's ruling Peronist Party have agreed on a draft confidentiality bill offering worried foreign businesses extra patent protection, Clarin newspaper reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>Humberto Roggero, Peronist head of the Industry Committee of the lower house of Congress, told Clarin in an interview that the Peronist majority had made a deal with the Foreign Ministry that is a compromise between U.S. and local demands.  </p>
<p>"With this draft we have united positions: everyone objects," joked Roggero, who expects the bill to be debated by Deputies in Wednesday's extraordinary session after it failed to make the Chamber last Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We had to reach a compromise to avoid relations with the United States deteriorating. We couldn't risk trade sanctions," Roggero said.</p>
<p>The Argentine Foreign Ministry lobbied Congress to toughen up the original draft bill to keep the United States, and other pharmaceutical exporting nations, happy. </p>
<p>Patent protection, especially for pharmaceuticals, has been a sticking point in otherwise fluid relations between Argentina and the United States for two years and has also been a subject of complaint for European Union countries.</p>
<p>One senior U.S. official complained recently Washington was "frankly disappointed" at the patent law passed in March.</p>
<p>Confidentiality is designed to beef up patent protection by blocking dissemination of technical information on a new product for five years after it is registered.  </p>
<p>President Carlos Menem increased pressure on Congress to pass the bill, saying Monday it would show "loyalty in trade relations" that would help win Argentina a "privileged" position as a non-NATO ally for the United States.</p>
<p>But Menem, who talked patents with President Bill Clinton last week, said it was "a request and not a demand from the United States" and Argentina hopes for beef sales in return.</p>
<p>Opposition anger at last-minute changes to the draft bill by Peronists in the Industry Committee, including one bringing the law into immediate effect instead of from 2000, led to last Wednesday's disappointment in Congress.</p>
<p>Germany's ambassador to Buenos Aires, Wiegand Pabsch, made a plea for the bill. The patent law passed in March "did not completely satisfy us but is a step forwards," he said. A confidentiality law would "improve the situation a little."</p>
<p>Peronist Deputy Roggero said the new draft was not totally in line with U.S. requests as it protected products for five years instead of six and was not retroactive. He also also acknowledged local drug firms' objections. "They are very angry. But the foreigners are not completely happy either."</p>
