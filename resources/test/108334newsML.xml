<p>The U.S. Treasury market gets data on September wholesale prices and retail sales on Friday.</p>
<p>If the data come in as expected, the market could attract some buyers, analysts said.</p>
<p>"Unless it's a very, very bearish print, there will probably be a bit of a relief rally after the numbers," said Waldo Best, senior economist at BZW Securities Inc.</p>
<p>"If the numbers are neutral, I would look for a (market) improvement," said Michael Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc.  </p>
<p>The data are due at 0830 EDT/1230 GMT. Economists polled by Reuters estimate that the Producer Price Index (PPI) rose 0.3 percent in September and increased 0.2 percent when more volatile food and energy items in the index were set aside.</p>
<p>September retail sales are expected to be up a slight 0.2 percent, the economists said. Without the auto component, retail sales are expected to be up 0.3 percent.</p>
<p>"We're looking more at the retail sales," said Joshua Feinman, vice president and global markets economist at Bankers Trust. "We really want to see what the consumer is up to here."  </p>
<p>Best said after a week-long sell-off, the market would open lower on Friday before the 0830 EDT economic reports.</p>
<p>"There will be some selling pressure early in the session up until you get the number," he said.</p>
<p>But afterwards, if the data don't contain any negative surprises, the market should improve.</p>
<p>"We've oversold the strength of the PPI number," said Best. "I think it's going to be a trend number -- not horrible -- for both the PPI and the (September) CPI (Consumer Price Index) on Wednesday."  </p>
<p>The market rallied on an unexpected drop in September payroll jobs last Friday.</p>
<p>But since then, the market has retreated, erasing all the gains from Friday's rally.</p>
<p>Prices fell sharply on Thursday. The 6-3/4 percent 30-year bond was down 20/32 to 98-11/32 in late afternoon trade, yielding 6.88 percent, versus a 6.75 percent yield at the Friday, October 4 close.</p>
<p>Even if Friday's numbers are friendly to the bond market, the upside could be limited by the knowledge that the September CPI report is just ahead.  </p>
<p>"People are thinking of the CPI," said Moran. "They might conclude that we still have to look at the CPI and I think there's a very good chance that we will se a high side CPI on Wednesday."</p>
<p>The introduction of fall fashion apparel items carrying relatively high price tags, a likely increase in housing prices, higher college tuition payments, and the reinstatement of the airport tax that could boost prices of some airfares could all contribute to a bigger than usual increase in the September CPI, Moran said.</p>
<p>Federal funds will open between 5-3/16 percent and 5-1/4 percent on Friday, dealers indicated.</p>
