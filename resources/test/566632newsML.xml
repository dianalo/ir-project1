<p>Kansas Gov. Bill Graves supports the omnibus spending package approved by legislators earlier this week and thus far has not found reason to exercise his line-item veto, a spokesman said Wednesday.</p>
<p>While the spending package is still being reviewed, so far no "line-item veto fodder" has been found, Mike Matson said.</p>
<p>Legislators approved the plan, the last portions of the fiscal 1998 budget beginning on July 1, early Tuesday. It includes spending for 200 new prison beds this year and another 200 next year, if the need is shown, said Bill Miskell, spokesman for the Kansas Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>Under the spending plan, Norton Correctional Center will be expanded by 200 medium security beds paid for with $5 million of federal funds, $780,000 of state corrections funds and $364,000 from the state general fund, Miskell said.</p>
<p>The spending plan also includes the authority to issue up to $6.7 million of bonds in April 1998 to expand the Hutchinson Correctional Center by 200 beds, if a study determines that there is a need for it, Miskell said.</p>
