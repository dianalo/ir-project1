<p>Cabouchon, a glitzy costume jewelry firm, goes public in the United States next week, hoping to repeat its rapid growth in Europe and Japan.</p>
<p>Petra Doring, the German-born socialite who founded the company six years ago, said Wednesday she thought the group would succeed in the U.S. market.</p>
<p>"Initially, to be honest, I was a little bit scared because the U.S. has so much costume jewellery, but when we started our trials we had fantastic success," Doring, 36, said by telephone.</p>
<p>The company, with sales of about 120 million pounds ($200.8 million) last year, operates via a network of individuals -- whom the company calls "consultants" -- who sell directly to friends or run teams of other sellers.</p>
<p>It now operates in 17 countries and currently has 16,000 "consultants" -- including some celebrities and aristocrats -- who earn commissions on what they sell.</p>
<p>The company launches two new jewelry ranges each year with a special theme for each, such as the Russian czars or images of India. It has also recently expanded into accessories such as belts, buckles, watches and ties.</p>
<p>Individual pieces cost between four and 140 pounds (about $7 to $200).</p>
