<p>House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer said Tuesday that no effective date had been set yet for an expected capital gains tax cut.</p>
<p>"I'm not leaning toward anything right now, that's very much up for consideration and I'll be talking to Senator (William) Roth about it," Archer, a Texas Republican, told reporters. Roth, a Delaware Republican, is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.</p>
<p>A capital gains tax cut was one of the components included in the budget deal announced Friday between congressional leaders and the White House.  </p>
<p>There is some concern that investors may hold off on selling assets until they find out when a capital gains tax cut would go into effect.</p>
<p>Archer said he expected "markup" of tax legislation to occur "reasonably quickly" after the budget resolution is passed. A committee markup gives lawmakers the opportunity to amend proposed legislation.</p>
<p>"I want to have a package that will give relief to hard-hit middle-income families, particularly with children, and one that will have adequate incentives for savings and capital formation and job creation," Archer said. "I think there should be a very good balance between those two."  </p>
<p>Asked whether Superfund money would be used to offset tax cuts, Archer replied: "I don't plan on putting any Superfund taxes into this tax bill until I see major structural reform of the spending program."</p>
<p>The one item that would definitely be included in his own tax plan would be the elimination of ethanol subsidies, Archer said.</p>
<p>On the airline ticket tax, Archer said, "I am hopeful that we will have a revised formula that we can put in place for a number of years into the future."</p>
