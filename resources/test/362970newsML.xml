<p>Serbia lost around 1.26 billion dinars ($230 million) in 1996 tax revenues on the illegal cigarette trade, Belgrade daily Politika said on Friday.</p>
<p>"Based on our calculations, due to poor sales of locally produced cigarettes, the state lost at least 1.26 billion dinars in uncollected taxes and excise duties last year," Tobacco Fund director Svetozar Zlatkovic was quoted by Politika as saying.</p>
<p>Smuggled cigarettes account for as much as 71 percent of estimated annual domestic consumption of around 23,000 tonnes (1 tonne = cca 50,000 packs).</p>
<p>"If the state were to calculate taxes on all smuggled foreign cigarettes, the loss would increase by as much as 40-50 percent since taxes, customs and excise duties on imported cigarettes are much higher," Zlatkovic said.</p>
<p>According to the fund's figures, domestic producers sold slightly over 7,000 tonnes of cigarettes last year.</p>
<p>Average monthly consumption in "normal conditions" is estimated at 1,916 tonnes, but local producers sold only 183 tonnes on the legal market last December.</p>
<p>Zlatkovic warned that tolerating the booming illegal trade has inflicted serious damage on the domestic tobacco industry, currently operating at just a third of its capacities.</p>
<p>Unless the state takes urgent steps to curb the grey economy, Yugoslav tobacco factories could come to a complete halt, Zlatkovic warned.</p>
<p>The state last summer introduced tax stamps on cigarette packs, which domestic producers said only raised their prices, making them even less competitive with contraband goods.</p>
<p>Cigarette smuggling became profitable business during 3-1/2 years of an international trade embargo which brought Yugoslavia's economy to a standstill.</p>
<p>Despite frequent pledges by government officials to clamp down on the grey economy, little has been done in fear of social unrest from the hundreds of thousands who have survived on it.</p>
