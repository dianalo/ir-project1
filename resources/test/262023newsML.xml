<p>Pakistani cotton rates dropped on Tuesday as sharp price rises over the past few sessions forced spinners to the sidelines. Dealers said the market was likely to remain weak to steady on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The buying spree is over," dealer Mustafa Hussain said, adding that spinners had stayed out while ginners marked down their rates to lure them back into the market.</p>
<p>Hussain said fresh cotton arrivals from farms would depress prices further in the next few sessions.</p>
<p>In the kerb market NIAB-78 variety was traded at 2,150 rupees ($53.45) per maund (37.32 kg), dealer said.</p>
