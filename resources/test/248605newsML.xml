<text>
<p>British Prime Minister John Major's government was again under fire over allegations of sleaze on Wednesday when a junior minister was forced to resign after his behaviour was slammed in a parliamentary report.</p>
<p>Including David Willetts, Major's government has lost nine ministers and seven senior members of parliament because of improprieties, mainly of a sexual nature, since the 1992 election.</p>
<p>The Standards and Privileges Committee said Willetts should not have discussed a sleaze inquiry, into ex-minister  Neil Hamilton, with the chairman of a committee investigating it when he was a government "whip", or parliamentary business manager.</p>
<p>It said Paymaster-General Willetts had gone "beyond what should properly have taken place" and his evidence to the Standards Committee was not accurate.</p>
<p>The following is a list of the political casualties:</p>

<p>Oct 1994 - Neil HAMILTON, corporate affairs minister, quit saying he needed to fight to clear his name after the allegations he had taken cash for questions and that he failed to declare favours from Fayed, including a stay in Paris Ritz.</p>

<p>Jan 1994 - Earl of CAITHNESS, aviation and shipping minister, resigned after his wife's suicide.</p>
