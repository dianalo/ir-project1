<p>Panama denied Wednesday it was violating international tuna conservation efforts and expressed surprise at a possible call by the United States for an international ban on tuna imports from Panama.</p>
<p>"This news took us by surprise because we don't have any knowledge of any Panamanian ship fishing in contested waters," Commerce Minister Raul Arango Arango told reporters.</p>
<p>He said all Panamanian-registered ships were told last month their registry would be cancelled if they were caught fishing bluefin tuna.</p>
<p>Arango asked the Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna (ICCAT) to investigate "and tell us which ships are committing this indiscretion."</p>
<p>A U.S. government official said last week the United States might call for an international ban on imports of tuna from Panama, Honduras and Belize to pressure those governments to back tuna protection efforts.</p>
<p>ICCAT, which is due to meet in San Sebastian, Spain from Friday, warned the three countries, which are not members of the commission, last year that fishing of bluefin tuna by their ships was undermining conservation.</p>
<p>The bluefin tuna has been depleted in the Atlantic by about 87 percent in the last 20 years. About 43,000 tons of tuna are caught annually worldwide. Japan imported a total of 674 metric tons of bluefin tuna from Belize, Panama and Honduras in 1994.</p>
