<p>Madrid stocks closed flat on Wednesday after recouping early losses as bigger shares staged a late term recovery.</p>
<p>Dealers said U.S. factors, including publication of the Federal Reserve's Beige Book on interest rate outlooks, would have the biggest influence on Madrid stocks short term.</p>
<p>The General index fell 0.19 points, 0.05 percent, to 351.95 and the Ibex-35 lost 2.37 points, 0.06 percent, to 4,001.34.</p>
<p>Repsol gained 60 pesetas, 1.46 percent, to 4,160 with more than 570,000 shares traded, regaining ground after a temporary price slide due to announced petrol price changes</p>
<p>"The session was pretty uninteresting, although later on there was more buying in companies like Repsol that helped the indices and the ambience is lightly positive," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Trading volume was off a bit from Tuesday with 19.0 billion pesetas in business done.</p>
<p>Electricity firm Iberdrola came under pressure from foreign sellers and shed 15 pesetas, 1.3 percent, to 1,120 with 2.6 million shares traded.</p>
