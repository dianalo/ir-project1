<p>Japanese whaling ship Nisshin Maru returned to a Tokyo port on Tuesday with 77 minke whales caught during a two-month "research" mission to the northwest Pacific, fishery ministry officials said.</p>
<p>The whale carcasses will be unloaded in several days and shipped to warehouses throughout Japan. Some of the whale meat will eventually be distributed to people in whaling villages and some will be auctioned.</p>
<p>The 7,440-tonne Nisshin Maru and three catcher boats set sail from Yokosuka, south of Tokyo, in July with the aim of catching 100 minke whales.</p>
<p>The catcher boats were expected to return home on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The International Whaling Commission (IWC) adopted a resolution in Jule in Aberdeen, Scotland, calling on Japan to stop research whaling.</p>
<p>Activists say Japanese research whaling is thinly disguised commercial whaling because most of the meat ends up as an expensive delicacy in Japanese restaurants.</p>
<p>Environmentalists have criticised Tokyo's claim that whaling is a deep part of the country's culture. However, no protesters were seen at the ship's return.</p>
<p>Japan has conducted research whaling in the Antarctic since 1987 and in the northwestern Pacific since 1994.</p>
<p>Japan has killed about 300 minke whales annually in the name of scientific research since since it joined the global moratorium in 1987.</p>
<p>Japan, the world's biggest consumer of whalemeat, says successive research missions to the Antarctic have shown that stocks in some areas have recovered enough to justify the resumption of commercial whaling.</p>
