<p>Secessionist leader Umberto Bossi was taking his three-day "independence" march across Italy to his Northern League party's heartlands on Saturday after clashes erupted after a rally on the first leg.</p>
<p>Police wearing riot gear and carrying shields moved in to contain some 700 ultra-left-wing youths who were pelting League supporters with stones and glass in the northern city of Turin on Friday night after a speech by Bossi and a fireworks show.</p>
<p>A police spokesman said tear gas was used to disperse the clashes but said no arrests were made. Italian television showed shots of a large group of youths with banners and others running through the streets, displacing metal crush barriers.</p>
<p>Five police officers were hurt, the most serious having been hit on the head, and some cars damaged, the spokesman said. Several civilians were also reported slightly injured.</p>
<p>"The situation was always under control," he said.</p>
<p>The ugly scenes were not the most auspicious end to the first day of Bossi's "March to the Sea" from the source of the River Po in the west to the lagoon city of Venice in the east.</p>
<p>Bossi launched his journey with a quasi-religious rite at the Alpine source of the Po, when he clambered over rocks to fill a flask with water symbolising the birth of his nation.</p>
<p>The firebrand leader aims to proclaim independence for the self-styled state of "Padania" in Venice on Sunday evening, but his rabble-rousing anti-Rome invective contained darker hints.</p>
<p>Bossi, whose party flag shows a mediaeval warrior raising aloft his sword, told followers that Italy had one year to grant independence or "Padania will take its own freedom".</p>
<p>His journey moves into the heart of Lombardy on Saturday, the seat of the original Lega Lombarda (Lombard League) which was created in 1167 as an association of Lombard cities against the Emperor Barbarossa.</p>
<p>Police estimated some 3,000 supporters thronged the banks of the Po, Italy's longest river, in Turin on Friday night to hear Bossi declare the first day a towering success and cry "Viva Padania". He estimated millions would turn out at Venice.</p>
<p>His opening gambit high in the mountains near Italy's border with France roused massive media attention but only a few hundred of his own supporters turned up in the early stages.</p>
<p>Bossi was set to board a boat and a catamaran to negotiate part of the second leg of his trek, including rallies scheduled for the towns of Cremona and Borgoforte, near the mediaeval town of Mantua where his self-styled parliament of the north sits.</p>
<p>Although discontent at high taxes, bureaucracy and public-sector inefficiency runs deep in the region, Italy's richest and most developed, few apparently share Bossi's radicalism.</p>
<p>A survey by Datamedia published on Friday found 85.6 percent of Italians opposed secession while only 7.6 were in favour.</p>
<p>A host of groups have organised counter-demonstrations in favour of unity and politicians from across the political spectrum have dismissed Bossi's policies -- which include a separate currency to take "Padania" into Europe's planned Economic and Monetary Union -- as ludicrous stunts.</p>
<p>Former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who was toppled from power in 1994 when Bossi acrimoniously upset the governing coalition, accused the League leader of sowing "ethnic hatred".</p>
<p>Bossi has ploughed on regardless, declaring an "unstoppable" momentum. "The force is with us," he said.</p>
<p>"Like it or not, on Sunday we'll make history in Venice," a key lieutenant, ex-interior minister Roberto Maroni, echoed.</p>
<p>"On September 15, 1996, like on July 4, 1776, a new nation will be born," he told supporters, alluding to the U.S. declaration of independence.  REUTER</p>
