<p>SUGAR - World market for March 4, 1997</p>
<p>White sugar futures in London ended a range-bound day firmer. May added $0.60 to close at $308.00 per tonne, while August was up $0.50 to close at $307.10 per tonne.</p>
<p>Raw sugar futures in New York closed higher across the board with front month May adding 4 points to close at 10.88 cents/lb, while July closed 7 points higher at 10.71 cents/lb. The May/July spread narrowed to 17 points from 20 points after the previous close.</p>
<p>Dock-workers at Brazil's Paranagua port said there is a 90 per cent chance that they will stage a 24-hour strike Wednesday, which, however, is not likely to have any significant impact on world market prices. In the absence of fresh fundamental news prices are likely to remain rangebound.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>INDIA - Indian sugar production continues to be significantly lower than last season. Production in January 1997 reached 2.2 million tonnes, raw value, down from nearly 3 million tonnes produced the same month the previous year. That brought total production since the beginning of 1996/97 (October) up to 6.1 million tonnes, down from 7.0 million tonnes produced the same period in 1995/96.</p>
<p>The figures up to the end of January points to a seasonally adjusted total of 14.3 million tonnes, which compares to the latest estimate of Indian Sugar Mills Association of 15.3 million tonnes and last year's production of 17.9 million tonnes. Hence, production will have to pick up to meet expectations. However, even if production should be only 14.2 million tonnes this season, there will be more than enough sugar left for domestic consumption and exports.</p>
<p>ITALY - Sugar imports in October 1996 amounted to 49,865 tonnes, raw value, up from last year's 25,035 tonnes. This brought cumulative imports in the first quarter of 1996/97 (August/October) up to 93,206 tonnes compared to 62,344 tonnes in the like period the previous year. Total imports in 1995/96 reached 379,026 tonnes against 266,279 tonnes in 1994/95.</p>
<p>Major countries of origin in August/October 1996 were Germany with 35,266 tonnes whites against 13,719 tonnes, France with 21,287 tonnes compared to 27,427 tonnes and the United Kingdom with 9,484 tonnes, up from 8,109 tonnes.</p>
<p>Sugar exports in October 1996 reached 21,807 tonnes, down from 38,971 tonnes in October 1995. This brought cumulative exports in August/October 1996 up to 48,514 tonnes compared to 105,713 tonnes in August/October 1995. Total exports in 1995/96 reached 170,210 tonnes against 124,787 tonnes in 1994/95.</p>
<p>Major countries of destination in August/October 1996 were Lebanon with 11,288 tonnes whites against 14,343 tonnes, Croatia with 10,057 tonnes against 10,103 tonnes and Greece with 6,838 tonnes compared to one tonne.</p>
<p>SWEDEN - Sugar exports in November 1996 amounted to 8,704 tonnes, raw value, down from 10,827 tonnes in November 1995. This brought cumulative exports in the first quarter of 1996/97 (September/November) up to 11,383 tonnes against 10,910 tonnes in 1995/96. Total exports in 1995/96 reached 32,570 tonnes against 17,606 tonnes in 1994/95.</p>
<p>Major countries of destination in September/November 1996 were Norway with 3,813 tonnes whites, Uzbekistan with 2,000 tonnes and Estonia with 1,999 tonnes.</p>
<p>TENDERS</p>
<p>Bangladesh will hold buying tenders on March 8 and 15 for one cargo of 150 ICUMSA white sugar on each day. The country bought 12,500 tonnes of 150 ICUMSA white sugar at $347.95 per tonne c&amp;f at its tender on March 1.</p>
<p>China bought another cargo of Thai raw sugar from Mitsui for prompt shipment. Traders said they expected the shipment of two more cargoes this month. The sugar is most likely for refining and re-export.</p>
