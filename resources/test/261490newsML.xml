<p>CBOT rice futures closed narrowly mixed and the market remained rangebound as it absorbed bullish input from slow farmer selling and a mild recovery in Asian cash market values, traders said.</p>
<p>The market this week also took note of flooding in southern India, which led to talk of a short-term rice shortfall in that region.</p>
<p>But futures trading remained choppy with Tuesday's volume estimated by the CBOT at 300 contracts, below the 482 contracts traded Monday.</p>
<p>Rice futures closed one cent per cwt higher to one cent lower, with January down one cent at $10.68 per cwt.</p>
