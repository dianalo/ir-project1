<p>U.S. credit markets will have a busy day on Thursday as players brace for the release of two key economic indicators -- the consumer price index and retail sales data, both for the month of October.</p>
<p>Wall Street pundits said the two indicators are likely to be market friendly, but focus will be kept on retail sales.</p>
<p>They said the behavior of the American consumer will be key to define how much the U.S. economy will grow in the fourth quarter and, ultimately, the future of monetary policy in the months to come.  </p>
<p>"The retail sales report may be more important because it will give us a feeling for whether the economy is continuing to slow or whether it's rebounding in the fourth quarter," said Peter Kretzmer, economist at Nationsbanc Capital Markets.</p>
<p>"My own sense is that the October number is going to be weaker than what a lot of analysts think," he added.</p>
<p>In a Reuters survey, U.S. economists expect overall retail sales to post a 0.3 percent rise in October against a 0.7 percent jump earlier. The ex-autos number is also seen up 0.3 percent versus a 0.4 percent rise in September.  </p>
<p>On the consumer inflation front, analysts expect a fairly subdued number, mainly after the release of the October Producer Price Index (PPI) on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The overall PPI rose a more-than-expected 0.4 percent. However, the core index, which excludes the volatile food and energy price fluctuations, fell 0.3 percent.</p>
<p>"We're looking for just trend-like increases in the CPI," said Dana Johnson, head of market analysis at First National Bank of Chicago. U.S. analysts in a Reuters poll expect the October overall CPI will rise 0.3 percent while the core index will rise 0.2 percent.  </p>
<p>The market will also take in jobless claims for the week ended November 9. Analysts see claims rising to 334,000 against 331,000 in the previous week.</p>
<p>If the data come in as expected, the Treasury market is expected to consolidate at current levels.</p>
<p>Analysts said the recent run-up in prices after the U.S. elections, which took prices to the lowest levels in eight months, took place very quickly and the market is now expected to catch its breath. "Keep your long-end (yields) circled around 6.50 percent (because) it's probably where we're going to settle down here," Johnson said.  </p>
<p>Late on Wednesday trade, the 6-1/2-percent benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury bond was quoted down 4/32 at 100-20/32. Its yield was at 6.45 percent.</p>
<p>Some analysts were a little more bearish on the near future of the U.S. Treasury market.</p>
<p>John Williams, managing director and chief global markets economist at Bankers Trust, said he sees the yield on the 30-year bond moving towards 7.00 percent by the end of the year and to around 7.50 percent by mid-1997.  </p>
<p>Analysts said the market also quickly digested a decision by the Federal Reserve Board to keep monetary policy unchanged at the November 13 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC).</p>
<p>"That was totally in line with the market's expectations. It became a non-event going forward," said a trader at a foreign investment bank here.</p>
<p>The Fed refrained from open market operations on Wednesday. The federal funds rate is expected to open at 5.25 percent on Thursday, in line with the Fed's target.</p>
