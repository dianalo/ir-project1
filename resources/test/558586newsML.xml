<p>Three men died in a hail of bullets in a drive-by shooting in Macau on Sunday in the latest wave of violence to batter the tiny Portuguese-run territory, police said.</p>
<p>The three were inside a car riddled with bullets by gunmen travelling on motorcycles, they said.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, police had detained more than 100 people for questioning after a sweep of several casinos.</p>
<p>A spate of gangland-style killings and bombings has rocked Macau in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Police say organised gangs, known as triad societies, are waging a "turf war" over gambling-related businesses in Macau, which is famed for its casinos.</p>
