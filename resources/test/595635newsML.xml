<p>The leaders of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, arrived at the House of Commons on Monday to protest against a ruling that they may not use offices in the parliament to which they were elected on May 1.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams and the party's chief negotiator Martin McGuinness shook hands with a few cheering supporters and posed for photographers before going in for talks with parliamentary authorities.</p>
<p>Adams said they had been elected on a mandate which had been "arrogantly set aside" by the Speaker of the House of Commons, Betty Boothroyd, and they had come to challenge that.</p>
<p>"We're Irish republicans. We want to see peace on the island of Ireland and between the people of our island and the people of this island," Adams told reporters.</p>
<p>The Commons speaker last week ruled the two could not use parliamentary offices or other facilities such as free telephones unless they took the oath of allegiance to Queen Elizabeth sworn by every MP before taking his seat.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein and its Irish Republican Army (IRA) sympathisers refuse to swear allegiance to the crown. They want an end to British rule in Northern Ireland, where the majority of the population is Protestant and loyal to London.</p>
<p>Adams and McGuinness were elected to the Commons for two constituencies in Northern Ireland. Adams argued at the weekend that his party had nowhere else to send elected representatives even though it contests parliament's authority.</p>
<p>The presence of Sinn Fein at Westminster has enraged many, who say they cannot be separated from the armed guerrillas. A republican splinter group, the INLA, blew up British MP Airey Neave in 1979 as he left parliament's underground car park.</p>
<p>Former Northern Ireland minister Peter Bottomley said he hoped Sinn Fein would commit itself to democratic and peaceful forms of protest and renounce violence.</p>
<p>After paying tribute to Neave, he told reporters: "Let's try to get everyone to realise that crosses on the ballot paper matter more than crosses in cemeteries. It's time for people to give up violence...and submit themselves to the popular will."</p>
<p>Sinn Fein has been excluded from all-party peace talks until the IRA stops its bombing campaign.</p>
<p>But the new Labour government has offered to ease a ban on official contacts with Sinn Fein to help find a negotiated settlement to the 28-year Northern Ireland conflict.</p>
<p>The British and Irish governments have banned contacts with Sinn Fein since the IRA resumed its war in Northern Ireland by ending a 17-month ceasefire in February 1996.</p>
<p>But Prime Minister Tony Blair said last week, in the first new initiative on Northern Ireland since the bombing resumed, that he would allow government officials to meet Sinn Fein provided the IRA did not carry out further acts of violence.</p>
