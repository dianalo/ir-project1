<p>Pakistan needs to take "decisive" measures to stabilize its economy, a senior International Monetary Fund official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"There is a need for a decisive set of measures to be implemented by the government,' IMF First Deputy Managing Director Stanley Fischer told Reuters. "That is what we're looking for."</p>
<p>Fischer is flying to New York today to meet Pakistan Prime Minister Benazhir Bhutto to discuss what needs to be done and the possibility of the IMF sending a mission to the country to try to work out an economic plan with the government.</p>
<p>The IMF withheld an $80 million tranche due in June, and part of a $600 million standby loan, pending a review of Pakistan's 1996-97 budget. "We'll see whether the government can implement the polcies that are needed to stabilize the situation," Fischer said.</p>
<p>An adviser to Bhutto told the IMF/World Bank annual meeting on Wednesday that Pakistan was working to get back into the good graces of the two organizations.</p>
<p>Bhutto is also slated to meet World Bank President James Wolfensohn Thursday. Wolfensohn, who is flying to New York for the meeeting, termed the get-together a "courtesy call."</p>
