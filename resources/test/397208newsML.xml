<p>Hyatt Hotels Corp said Monday it will spend $1 billion over the next three years to acquire between 20 and 30 hotels and resorts in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Owned by Chicago's Pritzker family, Hyatt said the acquisition program follows a recent reorganization of various Pritzker-owned real estate interests in Hyatt hotels. The family recently formed Hyatt Equities L.L.C., a real estate acquisition company, which has a portfolio of 32 hotels.</p>
<p>Being a private company, Hyatt Equities will be able to use a much broader range of transaction structures than is typically available to public companie, real estate investment trusts or acquisition funds, the company said.</p>
<p>Hyatt Hotels and its Hyatt International unit operates 176 hotels and resorts in more than 35 countries.</p>
