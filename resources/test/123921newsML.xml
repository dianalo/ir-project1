<p>Summit Technology Inc., which makes laser devices for treating vision problems, said Thursday that a private German company agreed to pay it 1.23 million German marks ($800,000) in satisfaction of a judgment Summit won in a patent-infringement suit.</p>
<p>Summit said Herbert Schwind GmbH &amp; Co. agreed to the payment after Summit won a judgment in Germany that Schwind's Keratom ophthalmic excimer laser system infringed Summit's "Azema" patent.</p>
<p>The company, based in Waltham, Mass., said it also obtained a separate judgment in Germany against Chiron Technolas for infringement of the same patent. No financial details were announced regarding that action.</p>
<p>Summit's stock gained 37.5 cents to $5.75 in afternoon trading on the Nasdaq market.</p>
