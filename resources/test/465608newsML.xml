<p>British property group Chelsfield Plc on Tuesday reported increased profits and plans to raise 62.2 million pounds ($100.5 million) by placing 20 million new shares.</p>
<p>Chelsfield chairman Elliot Bernerd told Reuters he was pleased with the group's asset performance, which rose 22 percent in 1996 even without taking into account two of its main developments, which it was holding at cost.</p>
<p>The group's net asset value (NAV) per share rose to 225.6 pence from 184.8 pence a year earlier. Pretax profits for 1996 were 14.4 million pounds against 10.6 million pounds in 1995 and it will pay an increased total dividend of 3.0 pence.</p>
<p>Bernerd said the group was also extremely pleased with its 90 million pound purchase of the London and New York Westbury hotels from British media and leisure group Granada Group Plc .</p>
<p>The proceeds of the new share placement, which will be at 317 pence per share, will be used to finance this as well as the group's overall development programme.</p>
<p>Bernerd said the Westbury hotel in London's West End would enable Chelsfield to develop a high standard retailing space as well as improving the hotel itself. "This kills two birds with one stone," he said.</p>
<p>He would not be drawn on whether the Westbury buy was a precursor to further activity in the hotels sector, but said that Chelsfield was already involved in leisure and this formed part of that.</p>
<p>"We are dealing within the core portfolio," he said, adding that the group was interested in expanding its leisure interests while reducing the office element of its portfolio.</p>
<p>Bernerd said Chelsfield hoped to begin work on its White City site, in west London, by the end of 1997 or early 1998 now that the appropriate planning consents had been obtained.</p>
<p>In his results statement he described it and Chelsfield's Paddington Basin investments as "amongst the most interesting development situations in central London at the present time".</p>
<p>He said the group was now "well on its way" with the White City leisure and retail project, which he said would be the largest shopping centre of its type in central London.</p>
<p>There was already good tenant demand for the site, which would be completed in a couple of years, although Bernerd declined to name which tenants would take space.</p>
<p>He described the Paddington Basin development as a "more complex situation" but said that the site provided "such an attractive starting base" that it could be built in a relaxed fashion and would be completed in phases.</p>
<p>A master plan had been submitted to the local planning authority and the first phase, a residential development of 500 apartments, would start later this year.</p>
<p>Bernerd said the leisure element of the development, which is situated around a canal basin near Paddington railway station, had great potential, with plenty of interest from restaurants and residential developers.</p>
<p>Chelsfield's shares were marked down one penny at 327 at 1600 GMT. ($ = 0.618 British 5 pence Pounds)</p>
