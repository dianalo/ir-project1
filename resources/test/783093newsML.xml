<p>Swedish engineering firm  Atlas Copco said on Wednesday that its weakest business area Construction and Mining Technique (CMT) could improve this year or in 1998.</p>
<p>"This year or next year I think we could see a turnaround in trends," chief executive Giulio Mazzalupi told a news conference in connection with the group releasing six-month earnings.</p>
<p>"Whether this means a profit margin of 10.2 percent or 9.8 percent is not essential."</p>
<p>Atlas Copco has a target of a double digit profit margins.</p>
<p>"The potential is there and CMT can generate double-digit margins," he said. "CMT is the result of many small acquisitions and needs constant consolidation and structural overhaul."</p>
<p>Atlas Copco said profit after financial items rose 10 percent to 1.72 billion crowns in the first half of the year compared to a year ago, well ahead of market expectations of 1.55 billion.</p>
