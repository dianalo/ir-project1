<p>Secretary-General Kofi Annan urged the Security Council on Friday to press rebels in eastern Zaire to accept a ceasefire agreed to by the Zairean government.</p>
<p>After a lengthy closed-door session with council members on the crisis in the Great Lakes region of central Africa, he said he also spoke about the need to get aid to the people affected by the fighting and what would have to be done to monitor a truce.</p>
<p>A cessation of hostilities is the first point of a five-point peace plan drafted by the secretary-general's trouble-shooter for the region, Mohammed Sahnoun, and endorsed last month by the Security Council.</p>
<p>The other points are withdrawal of all external forces, reaffirmination of respect for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity of Zaire and other states of the region, protection for all refugees and the eventual holding of an international conference.</p>
<p>The Zairean government on Wednesday agreed to the U.N. plan that it had earlier said was too timid. It also called for international monitors to help implement a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Annan, who was accompanied by Sahnoun at the council briefing, said he discussed with members the "urgent tasks we will need to undertake if there were to be a ceasefire, and appealed to them to put pressure on the other side to accept the ceasefire proposals or the five-point plan which the Zairean authorities have accepted."</p>
<p>He said he stressed the need for humanitarian access to bring in aid, freedom of movement for aid workers "and eventually a mechanism for monitoring a ceasefire, if it were to be agreed upon, and disengagement of the forces."</p>
<p>Tutsi-led rebels, who now control a large swathe of territory in eastern Zaire, took up arms in October, accusing the Zairean authorities of denying them citizenship and planning to expel them to Rwanda, the ancestral home they left up to 200 years ago.</p>
<p>The government ordered the expulsion of about 40 U.N. and non-governmental aid workers after they withdrew last weekemd from the country's third largest city, Kisangani, now threatened by rebel forces. The government said the pullout triggered a rebel slaughter of Hutu refugees and displaced Zairians.</p>
