<p>New afternoon floor trading hours for wheat futures and options on the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) will bolster interest in the contract by cash market participants, SFE chief executive Les Hosking said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Currently most trading in the wheat cash market occured during the afternoon and the new trading hours would encourage market participants to take immediate advantage of arbitrage opportunities between cash and futures markets, he said.  </p>
<p>The new trading hours would correspond with the trading hours of the Chicago Board of Trade's (CBOT) overnight screen dealing system, Project A, making it more convenient for Australian traders who operate in both markets, he said.</p>
<p>Interest in trading wheat futures and options during CBOT hours was strong among cash market participants, Hosking said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday a record 104 wheat options were traded on SYCOM, the SFE's screen-based trading system, compared with the previous record of 36 contracts set on July 24.  </p>
<p>As reported by Reuters on Wednesday, new trading hours for SFE wheat will be between 2.00 p.m. and 4.00 p.m. (0400 and 0600 GMT), beginning on August 11.</p>
<p>"A survey undertaken by SFE indicated unanimous support for a move from morning trading to an afternoon trading session," Hosking said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
