<p>Hitachi Ltd said on Wednesday it has shifted management of its bond investments to foreign companies from Japanese institutions because of a lack of transparency in their practices.</p>
<p>"We've completed switching almost all the money into transparent funds being managed by foreign companies," a Hitachi official said.</p>
<p>Since last year, Hitachi had urged major Japanese securities houses and their affiliated investment management firms to disclose details of their fund management, including information such as appraisal profits and losses on each invested fund.</p>
<p>But Hitachi said it only received lukewarm responses to its request.</p>
<p>The company invested around 50 billion yen in such funds at the end of February.</p>
<p>"The lack of disclosure in Japanese financial companies will force us to put money in foreign firms for the time being," he added.</p>
<p>The official declined to specify which foreign firms had won its business.</p>
<p>Hitachi had a net cash position worth about 146 billion yen at the end of March, with the rest of the money being invested in bank deposits among others, he added.</p>
