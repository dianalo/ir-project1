<p>After two years of operating joint lobster flights to meet Christmas-New Year demand in France, Air Canada and Air France plan separate programs to meet this year's peak demand for the popular holiday delicacy.</p>
<p>Air France is planning two dedicated B-747 freighter runs from Halifax, and will also carry some lobster traffic to France via its scheduled freighter runs ex-Montreal, said official Alain Vigeant.</p>
<p>Air Canada will ship lobster to France on its Halifax-London flights and by back-hauling lobster from the Atlantic provinces to Montreal and Toronto for transshipment on scheduled passenger flights, an official said. Through December, the daily Montreal-Paris flight is a B-747 combi.</p>
<p>Air Canada also has plans to ferry a B-747 combi without passengers to Paris-Orly in late-December for scheduled maintenance at Air France, and will fill all cargo and baggage space with as much as 60 tonnes of lobster.</p>
<p>Until last spring, Air Canada and Air France were passenger marketing partners, but their only special joint ventures on cargo were the lobster charters. -Air Cargo Newsroom Tel +44 171 542 7706 Fax +44 171 542 5017</p>
