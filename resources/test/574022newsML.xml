<headline>BASEBALL-CORA HAS 5 HITS AS MARINERS POWER PAST ORIOLES.</headline>
<dateline>BALTIMORE 1997-05-09</dateline>
<text>
<p>Joey Cora had a career-high five hits, including a solo home run, and Ken Griffey Jr added his league-leading 15th homer and four RBI to power the Seattle Mariners past the Baltimore Orioles 8-2 on Friday.</p>
<p>The diminutive Cora went 5-for-5 with three singles, a double and his second homer of the season. In his last five games, Cora is 11-for-19 (.578). He has hit safely in his last 11 starts.</p>
<p>"My fifth time up at-bat, I was thinking about a fifth hit," said Cora. "I'm excited that it happened. Our team is winning, and that is even more exciting."</p>
<p>Seattle, whose 11-5 road record is the best in the American League, broke open a 3-0 game in the fourth inning on Griffey's three-run homer. It moved Griffey past Tino Martinez of the Yankees for the league lead, while his four RBI placed him second behind Martinez with 39.</p>
<p>Jamie Moyer (2-0 ) improved to 4-0 against his former team, allowing two runs and six hits in 6 1/3 innings, while striking out eight.</p>
<p>"I had good movement," Moyer said. "The Orioles are a tough club and in this park anything can happen. Things happen, but you just have to concentrate on making your pitches."</p>
<p>B.J. Surhoff, who is hitting .416 (25-for-60) over his last 16 games, had a solo homer for the Orioles, whose three-game win streak ended.</p>
<p>Rocky Coppinger (1-1) got the loss, surrendering five runs and eight hits in three innings.</p>
<p>In New York, shortstop Derek Jeter's throwing error in the top of the 12th inning allowed Tim Spehr to score the go-ahead run as the Kansas City Royals rallied past the Yankees 7-5 for a controversial victory.</p>
<p>Jeff King added an RBI double in the 12th for the Royals, who scored three runs in the sixth after an incorrect call by third-base umpire Dale Ford with two out opened the door.</p>
<p>With a play in progress, Ford called Jay Bell out thinking incorrectly he had passed Jose Offerman on the basepaths. That stopped the play with Bell apparently about to be caught in an inning-ending rundown. After a conference, the umpires allowed the Royals to keep batting with Bell on third and King on second -- and Chili Davis singled them both in.</p>
<p>Jeter had a two-run homer for New York.</p>
<p>In Chicago, Dave Martinez's two-out single to right scored Norberto Martin with the winning run in the bottom of the 10th as the White Sox edged the Oakland Athletics 3-2 for their fourth win in five games.</p>
<p>The White Sox took advantage of a key error by third baseman Dave Magadan to score the game-winner.</p>
<p>Frank Thomas continued his torrid hitting with two more hits for Chicago. He has 20 hits in his last 40 at-bats and has raised his average to .348.</p>
<p>In Milwaukee, Cal Eldred rebounded from a poor start with seven strong innings and Mark Loretta and Jose Valentin each had two hits and an RBI as the Brewers beat the Anaheim Angels 5-4.</p>
<p>Eldred (4-3) allowed two runs and eight hits with four strikeouts and a walk. Doug Jones worked out of a jam in the ninth to record his seventh save.</p>
<p>Shigetoshi Hasegawa (1-2) suffered the loss, allowing five runs and seven hits in six innings with six strikeouts.</p>
<p>Darin Erstad led off with a homer for Anaheim, which suffered its third straight loss. Jim Leyritz and Tim Salmon also homered, but struck out back-to-back with the potential go-ahead runs on base in the ninth.</p>
<p>In Boston, Bobby Witt threw a five-hitter to become the American League's third sixth-game winner and Rusty Greer, Juan Gonzalez, Will Clark and Dean Palmer all drove in runs with two out in the fifth inning as the Texas Rangers defeated the Red Sox,5-1.</p>
<p>Witt (6-0) joined Andy Pettitte of the Yankees and Jimmy Key of the Orioles with six wins. He walked one and struck out five for his 42nd career complete game. Witt also tied Ferguson Jenkins for second on the Rangers' all-time list with 93 wins.</p>
<p>In Minnesota, Pat Hentgen dominated the Twins for the second straight start and Carlos Delgado and Benito Santiago had run-scoring singles in the second inning as the Toronto Blue Jays posted their sixth win in seven games, 4-1.</p>
<p>Hentgen (3-1), who pitched a four-hit shutout against Minnesota on Sunday, allowed one unearned run and six hits over eight innings. He walked one and struck out five to improve to 9-1 lifetime against the Twins. Hentgen has not allowed an earned run in his last 21 innings.</p>
<p>In Detroit, Charles Nagy pitched a seven-hitter for his first shutout in nearly 20 months and David Justice and Matt Williams homered as the Cleveland Indians blanked the Tigers 5-0.</p>
<p>Nagy struck out 11 and walked two en route to his first shutout since September 1995 against the Yankees.</p>
