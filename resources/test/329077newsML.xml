<p>British steel castings group William Cook Plc is preparing a leveraged buyout to fend off a hostile takeover bid from British engineering group Triplex Lloyd Plc, the Evening Standard newspaper said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The report said William Cook was expected to offer its shareholders 420p in cash.</p>
<p>Earlier this week Triplex stepped up its two-month fight for William Cook with a bid it said was worth 400.7p per share. Its target said however the bid was worth closer to 389.1p.</p>
<p>A spokesman for William Cook on Thursday declined to comment on the report.  </p>
<p>The report said William Cook would team up with venture capitalists GE Capital and Electra in the leveraged buyout.</p>
<p>Triplex said earlier this week its new offer valued William Cook at around 74.8 million pounds. The offer was based on 21 new Triplex shares and 3,740 pence in cash for every 20 William Cook shares.</p>
<p>The offer was described as final but Triplex reserved the right to raise its bid in the event of a rival offer being made. --London Newsroom +44 171 542 4017</p>
