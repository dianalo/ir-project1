<p>The Mauritian rupee weakened versus the dollar but firmed against the pound on Friday, reflecting overnight international trends, commercial bank foreign exchange dealers said.</p>
<p>The rupee was quoted at a mean commercial rate of 20.6395 against the dollar on Friday from 20.5670 on Thursday.</p>
<p>The rupee traded at a mean rate of 32.0305 for one pound from 32.1200 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Money dealers said the dollar's overnight strengthening in international markets was behind the weaker rupee against the American currency.</p>
<p>"We have been fixing the rupee mostly on international trends for one week now," one commercial dealer said.</p>
<p>The dealer added that less weakening pressure currently existed on the rupee as commercial banks are not quickly running short in their foreign currency reserves.</p>
<p>"The (interbank forex) market is more or less square. Banks can now meet their customers' demand with the receipts they are getting from exports and the tourism sector," the dealer said.</p>
<p>He added a central bank intervention of dollar sale last Monday also helped to square the interbank forex market position.</p>
<p>During the May-July period, commercial banks foreign currency reserves quickly got short because of a slower inflow of forex proceeds from the country's sugar exports and the low tourism season.</p>
<p>With the June to December 1996 sugar harvest season now well under way and the tourism sector having reached a peak in August, forex dealers currently see a more fluid foreign exchange market.</p>
