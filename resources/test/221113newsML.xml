<p>Parties in Italy's centre-left government said on Wednesday they were ready to change a controversial "Euro-tax" plan in the 1997 budget that has run into an outcry from the opposition and business groups.</p>
<p>Cesare Salvi, leader in the Senate (upper house) of the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), said proposed amendments to the unpopular scheme so as to reduce the burden on self-employed Italians would be published on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>He told reporters after coalition party politicians met Prime Minister Romano Prodi that the changes would be achieved without lowering the total amount of revenue -- 12.5 trillion lire ($8.3 billion) -- which the Euro-tax is meant to bring in.</p>
<p>"At eight o'clock (1900 GMT) the government will make its proposal to modify the Euro-tax and it will be a proposal (supported) by the parliamentary majority," Salvi said.</p>
<p>Prodi has drawn up a tough budget designed to cut 62.5 trillion lire ($41.3 billion) from next year's deficit and help Italy join Europe's planned single currency in 1999.</p>
<p>A key element of the package is the Euro-tax, a mixture of a one-off levy on income tax worth 5.5 trillion lire with the rest coming from an assault on tax evasion and other fiscal measures.</p>
<p>As now conceived, the levy would kick in for the self-employed on incomes above 10 million lire and at above 23 million lire for wage earners.</p>
<p>Salvi said the changes would not affect the impact of the levy on wage earners but did not make clear how any shortfall in overall revenue as a result of concessions to the self-employed would be covered.</p>
<p>Labour Minister Tiziano Treu and government supporters said the proposed revisions were intended as an olive branch to the centre-right Freedom Alliance.</p>
<p>"The government is committed to doing all it can to reach an understanding with the opposition," said Ottaviano Del Turco of the centrist Italian Renewal party in Prodi's coalition.</p>
<p>The Freedom Alliance, led by media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, boycotted the budget debate in the lower house this month in protest against government plans to legislate on some aspects of fiscal affairs without recourse to parliament.</p>
<p>It has not yet decided its position in the Senate.</p>
<p>Details of the Euro-tax were missing when the rest of the budget was approved by the Chamber of Deputies (lower house) this month in the absence of the opposition. A deal on the measures was hammered out with trades unions leaders last week.</p>
<p>The unions insisted on Wednesday that any revisions should not come at the expense of their members, a position backed by the hardline Communist Refoundation party whose support ensures Prodi his parliamentary majority.</p>
<p>Refoundation's Senate leader Luigi Marino said after Wednesday's talks with Prodi, however, that he believed a revision that all coalition parties could accept was possible.</p>
<p>The Freedom Alliance, which has organised demonstrations against the budget, wants to ease Euro-tax thresholds for the self-employed. But it indicated that the government offer of a review may not be enough win it over.</p>
<p>Enrico La Loggia, a senior member of Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, said the government must drop its request for special powers on fiscal policy.</p>
<p>"The fact that an issue as important as the Euro-tax is to be discussed in parliament is neither a courtesy nor a sign of openness to dialogue," La Loggia added.</p>
