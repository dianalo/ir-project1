<p>The Thai overnight interbank rate was up to 13.00-13.50 percent in late trade on Tuesday from 12.00 percent earlier and 11.00-12.50 percent late on Monday amid tightening money supply, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the liquidity was very tight today because banks were maintaining funds for the next reserve requirement and the corporate tax payment had begun to affect the money supply.</p>
<p>The baht was steady at 25.308-25.312 to the dollar in late trade from 25.308-25.311 early as strong demand for baht dampened the dollar's rise, dealers said.  </p>
<p>"Dollar buying brought the baht down to as low as 25.322 against the dollar in the afternoon as a result of the U.S.-Iraq crisis," said one currency dealer. "But the tight liquidity and strong demand for baht eventually pushed down the dollar against the baht."</p>
<p>The one-month dollar/baht swap premium rose to 9.75/10.50 satangs late from 8.25/9.25 earlier.</p>
<p>The mid-rate was fixed at 25.32 to the dollar against 25.31 on Monday.</p>
