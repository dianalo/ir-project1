<p>President Boris Yeltsin told the Russian people on Friday the economy had finally turned the corner after years of industrial decline.</p>
<p>"The breakthrough has already happened," Yeltsin declared in a radio address marking the first anniversary of his re-election for a second and final presidential term.</p>
<p>"That is it. We have reached the point when it is possible for production to go up. The decline has been stopped."</p>
<p>The 66-year-old president did not say when or by how much the economy would grow and made clear ordinary Russians would not feel the benefit immediately.</p>
<p>He later told a group of regional leaders that he wanted all wage arrears to public sector workers, such as teachers and doctors, paid within three months.</p>
<p>This would build on the recent success of paying off a huge backlog of unpaid pensions and go hand-in-hand with promises to pay all wages owed to the military in the next two months.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Anatoly Chubais, sitting beside Yeltsin, remonstrated with the president, telling him three months was not long enough to catch up.</p>
<p>But Yeltsin, looking flustered in brief television footage of the meeting, said: "It is possible if we all pull together."</p>
<p>The exchange appeared to be the first public disagreement between Yeltsin and Chubais, who was brought into the government last March to take charge of reforms. Chubais at times sat tapping his fingers on the table.</p>
<p>The presidential press service denied a report by Itar-Tass news agency that the president had said he might turn to foreign leaders for help in paying off the huge wage arrears, although the agency had directly quoted Yeltsin on this matter.</p>
<p>Tass reported the Kremlin denial without comment.</p>
<p>In his televised remarks, Yeltsin did not say how Russia might try to raise the money nor how much was needed.</p>
<p>Russia has funds set aside from the World Bank to help pay pensions and cushion the social effects of reforms, but only $300 million of the $800 million loan approved in June will be available immediately.</p>
<p>Russia's assessments of the economy are increasingly rosy. Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Wednesday that gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic health, had risen one percent in the first six months of this year.</p>
<p>That, he said, was the first rise in GDP, the value of goods and services produced, since the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, first elected in 1991, was sidelined by health problems for most of the first eight months of his second four-year term, which started a year ago. He has reaffirmed his grip on power since undergoing heart surgery last November.</p>
<p>"This year, I think, was the most difficult of my life, but it was also a special, unique one. I could never have imagined that a man of my age could change so much. But that is how it turned out," he said. "I can feel how I have changed."</p>
<p>Yeltsin said he had reshuffled the government in the spring to promote liberal reformers partly because his ill health made him realise how little time his presidency gave him to act.</p>
<p>"It was precisely then that I felt with particular acuteness how quickly time goes by, how much I still need to do," he said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said he had a new ability to seek compromise with opponents, including the communist-led State Duma, the lower house of parliament. The Duma has blocked reforms and refused to interrupt its summer vacation to consider urgent laws.</p>
<p>Yeltsin discussed the impasse on Friday with the Duma's communist speaker, Gennady Seleznyov. There was no word of any breakthrough but Seleznyov said the meeting had been "calm", and Tass said he was intending to take a planned holiday.</p>
<p>"In the old days, I would not have been able to put up with it (resistance) and would lash out," Yeltsin, who sent tanks to end a rebellion by hardliners in the Soviet-era parliament in 1993, said in the radio address.</p>
<p>"But now I have started to discuss things with them calmly, seek a solution. We have only one country and we must work together".</p>
