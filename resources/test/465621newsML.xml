<p>An unbeaten 73 from Saurav Ganguly and a timely interruption for rain helped India force a draw in their three day match with Barbados on Monday after they had been in danger of defeat.</p>
<p>The tourists, facing a first innings deficit of 128 runs, slumped 67 for three in their second innings with two full sessions still to go.</p>
<p>But showers during the lunch interval, which cut ten overs off the afternoon session, and the efforts of middle order batsman Ganguly allowed India to survive as the struggled to 166 for five at the close.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old left hander grinded away for three hours, striking 13 fours and facing 122 balls.</p>
<p>India have drawn all their matches on their Caribbean tour so far -- two tests against the West Indies plus matches against Jamaica and Barbados.</p>
<p>Barbados, on 338 for four overnight, declared their innings at the start of the day's play.</p>
<p>Openers Ajay Jadeja, who has not played in either test, and Vangipurappu Laxman provided a flourishing opening stand but the tourists then lost both openers and Robin Singh for nought in the final half-hour before lunch.</p>
<p>Jadeja was caught for 32 at third slip by Ottis Gibson off seamer Hendy Bryan, who four balls later made Singh fend a bouncer to leg gully where Vasbert Drakes held a brilliant diving catch.</p>
<p>Laxman batted solidly before Drakes bowled him for 30 with the score on 67.</p>
<p>In the shortened afternoon session, Ganguly and Rahul Dravid put on 35 runs for the next wicket before Dravid was caught down the legside for three by wicket-keeper Courtney Browne off Bryan, the pick of the bowlers with three for 37 off 17 overs.</p>
<p>In the final period, Patterson Thompson claimed the wicket of acting India captain Navjot Sidhu, who made a double century in the second test against the West Indies, for six. At the close, Saba Karim was not out nine.</p>
