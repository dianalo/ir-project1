<p>A sharp surge in Japan's trade surplus in May has reinforced U.S. fears that Tokyo's troublesome trade gap is again on an upward trend.</p>
<p>But Washington's worries are more likely to put pressure on Tokyo to keep domestic growth on track and open its markets than to foreshadow a U.S. push for a stronger yen, economists say.</p>
<p>Data released Wednesday showed Japan's customs-cleared trade surplus, often the source of bitter dispute with Washington, jumped more than 200 percent in May from a year earlier to 738.27 billion yen ($6.53 billion).</p>
<p>The surplus with the United States surged 93 percent in May from a year earlier to 322.87 billion yen ($2.85 billion).</p>
<p>"We still can't make any final judgment based on two or three months or even a quarter, but the numbers do reinforce our concern that the surplus appears to be climbing again and that this year there may be a significant increase in Japan's trade surplus," a U.S. official in Tokyo told Reuters.</p>
<p>The official declined to comment directly on what steps Japan should take to curb the rise in its surplus.</p>
<p>But he said: "There is an agreement on both sides that Japan also wants to have domestic demand-led growth and has pledged to avoid a resurgence in its current account surplus. That's why we're watching this closely."</p>
<p>The dollar edged down briefly to below 113 yen on the trade figures, as traders bet Japanese and U.S. authorities would favour a higher yen to rectify the trade gap. But it later rebounded to around 113.23 yen in late morning.</p>
<p>Officials on both sides of the Pacific have sought to play down speculation of a bust-up over trade when leaders from the Group of Seven of leading industrial nations meet in Denver, Colo., on June 20-22.</p>
<p>"In the short term, I think our trade in goods and services balance will be affected by temporary factors or the relative demand situation in Japan and overseas markets," a Finance Ministry official told reporters late Tuesday.</p>
<p>"But abstracting these various factors from the medium-term perspective, we do not envisage that Japan's trade in goods and services surplus will grow to an extent that would invite severe trade friction," the official added.</p>
<p>Economists agreed that Washington would bring up the trade gap in Denver but was unlikely to make a big fuss.</p>
<p>"I think all the posturing has taken place beforehand and I can't imagine there is going to be a lot of fisticuffs (in Denver)," said Richard Jerram, chief economist at ING Barings.</p>
<p>Washington is, however, likely to pressure Tokyo to keep interest rates at the rock-bottom levels, where they have rested since the Bank of Japan slashed its official discount rate to 0.5 percent in September 1995 to prop up the economy.</p>
<p>"You've got to put yourself in (U.S. Treasury Secretary) Robert Rubin's shoes. He said he would like to see domestic demand expand in Japan. What is the best way to achieve that? Yen strength would hurt manufacturers ... and if companies have no profits ... domestic demand won't go up," said Michael Hartnett, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Japan.</p>
<p>"The U.S. will make damn sure that (Japanese interest) rates don't follow taxes in going up," Hartnett added.</p>
<p>Washington has long voiced concerns that a rise in Japan's sales tax to 5 percent from 3 from April 1 would dampen Japan's domestic growth and depress its appetite for imports, and a Finance Ministry official acknowledged on Wednesday that the tax increase was one factor behind the surplus surge.</p>
<p>The United States might also urge Japan to loosen its tight grip on public spending. But with few signs that Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto will be willing to break a promise to get his fiscal house in order, encouraging deregulation is probably a better bet.</p>
<p>"They would prefer Japan to grow, but the U.S. understands that the room for manoeuvre on fiscal or monetary policy is quite limited," said Robert Feldman, chief economist at Salomon Brothers Asia. "The U.S. is concerned that Japan's budget deficit getting out of hand would be detrimental to the world economy, so that leaves deregulation."</p>
<p>A U.S. official said Tuesday that the two nations were close to agreeing on a new format for deregulation talks and could unveil the fresh deal when President Clinton meets Hashimoto in Denver ahead of the summit.</p>
