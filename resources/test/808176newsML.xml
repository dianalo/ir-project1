<p>A wet summer will force reductions in estimates of Ukraine's grain harvest and severely reduce quality, Western analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Most recent official forecasts have predicted a grain crop of 37.0 to 38.0 million tonnes, against a pitiful 25.4 million tonnes last year, which was blamed on drought.</p>
<p>"It will be give or take a couple of million from 35 million," said one Western analyst. "But the rain has been causing a real deterioration in the potential quality of the crop."</p>
<p>While the rain has slowed this month, Ukraine had above-average rainfall in July.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Yuri Karasyk said increasing amounts of grain were spoiling due to rains and harvest delays, state news agency Ukrinform reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The analyst said milling quality was low and that Ukraine was mostly producing feed wheat. Winter wheat has been forecast at 20 million tonnes against 13.4 million last year.</p>
<p>"Thirty-five million tonnes of lousy wheat is worse than a poor crop with a lot of good wheat," he added, saying the situation could spark battles between the government and private companies for available grain.</p>
<p>"About 20 percent of the crop would go to seed, and waste, and that's normal. Twenty percent would stay on the farms, and the state wants five to seven million. That doesn't leave much room for manoeuvre."</p>
<p>Industry representatives said earlier that Ukraine was releasing pre-purchased grain which some regions had prevented from being moved until the 1997 state grain order, set at 5.9 million tonnes from 5.0 million last year, had been filled.</p>
<p>Another analyst said about 75 to 80 percent of wheat harvested in central areas this year was class four and five, generally used as feed wheat, and that state contracts had made allowances for purchases of lower-quality grain.</p>
<p>"More silos have been receiving grain than usual. More grain is being delivered because it has to be dried," he said, adding that grain dryers required fuel -- difficult for the cash-starved sector to purchase.</p>
<p>Although the government said earlier the harvest was nearing completion, the analyst said it could stretch into September in northern and western areas.</p>
<p>"There's still a lot of grain out there. They could still get rain," he said, adding that some government departments now estimated a grain harvest of between 30 and 35 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Ukraine regularly produced annual grain crops of 50 million tonnes in the Soviet era, but the sector has suffered from shortages of money, good machinery, seed, fertiliser, herbicides and pesticides in the six years since independence.</p>
<p>"The weather is influencing the final estimates in two ways, quality and quantity," said an industry expert. "The older combines, and even newer combines, have trouble picking it up."</p>
