<p>Mexico will scrap its existing narcotics-fighting apparatus and start fresh with an independent new agency modelled on the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, Time reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>The weekly news magazine in its latest edition said under the plan, to be announced soon by President Ernesto Zedillo, the DEA, the FBI and even the CIA would be invited to help train and screen a new crop of better-paid Mexican drug fighters.</p>
<p>"We guarantee this new agency will be bulletproof when it comes to corruption," Time quoted a high-ranking Mexican official as saying.</p>
<p>But U.S. agents doubted Mexico's new drug superagency would be the first, Time said.</p>
<p>It quoted DEA administrator Tom Constantine as saying "There is not one single civilian law-enforcement institution in Mexico with which the DEA has a really trusting relationship."</p>
<p>Mexico's National Institute to Combat Drugs came under intense fire last week when its chief, Gen. Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was arrested for allegedly taking bribes from a drug kingpin at a time when the White House was debating whether to crertify Mexico as cooperative in the war against drugs.</p>
<p>Time said President Bill Clinton was initially inclined to yank Mexico's certification but Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, antidrug chief Gen. Barry McCaffrey and Attorney General Janet Reno cautioned that the anti-U.S. backlash would outweigh any potential political gain.</p>
<p>In the end Clinton declared Mexico a U.S. partner in the war on drugs, praising Zedillo for his "brave action" in a tough battle that must be fought together.</p>
