<p>Tight bowling by India's spin trio saw South Africa collapse to 119 for seven at tea on the second day of the first test on Thursday.</p>
<p>Anil Kumble, Sunil Joshi and Narendra Hirwani exploited a helpful pitch to set their team up for what could be a match-winning lead in the first innings.</p>
<p>The home side were also helped by some doubtful umpiring decisions. South African captain Hansie Cronje and Darryl Cullinan were both given out leg before to deliveries which pitched outside the leg stump.</p>
<p>The umpire in both cases was S.K. Bansal.</p>
<p>Cullinan hit 43, the highest score so far in the South African innings. Joshi had taken three for 24 runs, Hirwani two for 28 and Kumble two for 38.</p>
<p>India were out for 223 shortly before lunch.</p>
