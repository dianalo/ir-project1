<p>The Dutch central bank's sale of 300 tonnes of gold has increased fears of further central bank sales, clouding the price outlook for the precious metal, Asian and Australian dealers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Somehow that action reflects the European banks' philosophy or attitude towards their gold reserves, it opens the path for other central banks to follow," said a Chinese dealer in a Hong Kong firm.</p>
<p>The Dutch central bank said on Monday it sold 300 tonnes of gold from its reserves last year, one-fifth of its total holdings, raising US$3.8 billion which it will hold as interest bearing foreign currency reserves.</p>
<p>"Normally one would expect news like that to be bullish to the market. The sales are out of the way, therefore the price should rally," said Jonathan Spall, Deutsche Bank AG's precious metals head for Asia based in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>But spot gold had dipped to $357.00/50 an ounce at midday in Hong Kong on Tuesday, down from the market opening in the British colony and New York's overnight $358.30/70 close.</p>
<p>Gold was unchanged at the fix in London on Monday afternoon from its morning session at $359.60 following the news from Amsterdam.</p>
<p>"There's concern in the markets here that there may be further sales from European central banks pre-European Monetary Union and that has helped the bears more than it would help the bulls," Spall said.</p>
<p>Dealers said some of the gold had probably been absorbed by physical markets in Asia and some was likely to have gone into establishing long positions.</p>
<p>Some dealers said the gold had possibly been bought by Asian central banks, but noted that no big buyers had been noticed in the market last year.</p>
<p>China, Taiwan and Singapore, all Asian countries with very large foreign exchange reserves, have been mooted by the market as possible gold buyers moving to diversify their assets.</p>
<p>Taiwan central bank officials were not immediately available for comment, but local dealers said it was unlikely the country would increase its gold reserves this year and that China was a more likely buyer of large volumes of European gold.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I can't comment on that," said Swiss Bank Corp chief dealer Anderson Cheung in Hong Kong, referring to possibly buying by an Asian central bank.</p>
<p>But traders said it did not make a difference whether the gold turned up in a jewellery shop in Hong Kong or New York since there was simply more gold in the global market.</p>
<p>Japanese dealers said spot gold could now ease gradually towards the $350 level in the absence of a bullish reaction to the Dutch news.</p>
<p>"After the Dutch central bank's announcement, we expected gold to gain to above $360 immediately. But it didn't," a dealer at a major trade house in Tokyo said. "Some disappointed traders may launch concerted selling," he added.</p>
<p>But Koichiro Kamei, a manager in the Japan office of the industry promotional body, the World Gold Council (WGC), said the price of the precious metal could recover towards $365.</p>
<p>"Now we can confirm what was behind the gold market's steady price fall since the end of last year. This will be a positive factor," Kamei said.</p>
<p>"A growing concern in the market was that other central banks which have bigger gold holdings, such as Italy and Switzerland, were selling. We were relieved it was the Dutch."</p>
