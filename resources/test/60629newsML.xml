<p>Hideo Nomo threw the 20th no-hitter in Dodger history -- and the first ever in hitter-friendly Coors Field -- as Los Angeles beat the Colorado Rockies 9-0 Tuesday, padding their Western Division lead.</p>
<p>Nomo (16-10), who walked four, retired the final 11 batters en route to the major leagues' third no-hitter of the season, joining the Yankees' Dwight Gooden and Florida's Al Leiter.</p>
<p>Nomo, the first Japanese pitcher to hurl a no-hitter, retired all three batters in the ninth. The hard-throwing right-hander induced Eric Young to ground out to second for the first out and then got Quinton McCracken on a first-pitch grounder to the same spot. Nomo struck out Ellis Burks, his eighth strikeout of the game, for the final out.</p>
<p>Nomo, who won his fourth consecutive decision, allowed just two hits over eight innings five days ago against the Cardinals. Nomo improved to 3-0 lifetime in Colorado.</p>
<p>"I only concentrated on (the no-hitter) in the ninth inning," said Nomo through an interpreter.</p>
<p>The Dodgers won their fourth straight, increasing their National League West lead to 1 1/2 games over San Diego.</p>
<p>Ramon Martinez, the last foreign-born player to throw a no-hitter, was also the last Dodger to throw a no-no. Martinez turned the trick on July 14, 1995 against Florida.</p>
<p>The Rockies were also no-hit on May 11 by Leiter. The 1977 Angels were the last major-league team to be no-hit twice. The 1971 Reds were the last N.L. team to be held without a hit twice in the same season.</p>
<p>In Atlanta, John Smoltz picked up his 22nd win and Ryan Klesko had a bases-loaded double to cap a four-run fifth inning as the Braves held on for a 5-4 win over the fading Houston Astros.</p>
<p>Smoltz (22-8) allowed three runs and eight hits over eight innings, walked one and struck out seven, boosting his National League-leading total to 262.</p>
<p>His 262 strikeouts tie Phil Niekro's 1977 total for the most by a Braves pitcher since the team moved from Milwaukee. His wins match Tom Glavine's 1991 total as the most by a Brave since Tony Cloninger went 24-11 in 1965.</p>
<p>Mark Wohlers worked a shaky ninth for his 36th save, getting Craig Biggio to ground into a game-ending double play with the bases loaded.</p>
<p>The Astros have lost four straight and seven of nine to fall 3 1/2 games behind first-place St Louis in the National League Central Division. Houston is 0-8 on the road this month.</p>
<p>The World Series champion Braves remained six games in front of second-place Montreal in the Eastern Division. Atlanta has eight games remaining with Montreal.</p>
<p>Darryl Kile (12-9) took the loss.</p>
<p>In San Francisco, Barry Bonds' two-run homer in the bottom of the eighth snapped a tie and capped a six-run comeback as the Giants ended a six-game losing streak with a 9-7 defeat of the San Diego Padres.</p>
<p>Bonds, who had three hits including a two-run double in the fourth inning, passed his father Bobby and moved into sole possession of 54th place on baseball's all-time homer list.</p>
<p>Giants reliever Jim Poole (2-1) allowed one hit over 1 2/3 innings for the victory. Rod Beck retired Scott Livingstone, representing the tying run, in the ninth for his 34th save.</p>
<p>Dave Veras (2-1) took the loss in relief for the Padres, allowing two hits including Bonds' homer over two innings.</p>
<p>Ken Caminiti had a pair of homers for the Padres. His 121 RBI established a new franchise record for San Diego.</p>
<p>In Montreal, Jeff Fassero tossed a six-hitter and Moises Alou homered and drove in three runs as the Expos defeated the New York Mets 7-1.</p>
<p>Alou had three hits for the Expos, who moved within one game of the Padres in the N.L. wild-card race.</p>
<p>Fassero (15-9) walked two and struck out 10 in tossing his fifth complete game of the season and eighth of his career. The 10 strikeouts are the fourth time this season he has reached double figures.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, Pat Rapp won again against his favourite rival team and Devon White and Kurt Abbott each hit fourth-inning homers in the Florida Marlins' 11-5 victory over the Phillies.</p>
<p>Rapp (7-16) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs and eight hits. The right-hander walked two and struck out five as he improved to 3-1 with a 4.50 ERA against the Phillies this season. Against the rest of the league, Rapp is 4-15 with a 5.32 ERA.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Francisco Cordova scattered eight hits over seven innings and John Wehner had three hits and scored three times as the Pirates defeated the Cincinnati Reds 5-3 for their season-high sixth straight win.</p>
<p>Cordova (3-7) allowed two runs -- one earned -- while striking out two without a walk.</p>
<p>John Smiley (12-14) lost his fourth consecutive start. The left-hander has allowed 16 runs and 29 hits during the slide.</p>
