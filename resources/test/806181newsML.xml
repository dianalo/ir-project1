<p>Santander Investment analyst Luis Fernando Oliveira has started coverage of Brazilian tobacco company Cia Souza Cruz Industria e Comercio SA with a rating of buy.</p>
<p>-- In an August 15 report, Oliveira set a 12- to 18-month price target on the stock equivalent to $13, representing a 28 percent increase from current levels.</p>
<p>-- He said Souza Cruz, the largest tobacco company in Latin America, is the least expensive tobacco stock in the region. It is the world's largest exporter of raw tobacco.</p>
<p>-- "Tobacco and cigarette exports allow the company to increase cash and profits, despite self-imposed caps on domestic cigarette prices," Oliveira wrote.</p>
<p>-- "Given its nearly debt-free status, Souza Cruz would be virtually unaffected in the case of a devaluation of the real, making the stock a defensive investment option."</p>
<p>-- The company's shares were off 0.25 real to 10.65 in Sao Paulo. Souza Cruz is an affiliate of Britain's B.A.T Industries Plc.</p>
