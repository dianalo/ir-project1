<p>Federal officials said Monday they have no comment on penalties paid by municipal bond underwriter Calvin Grigsby, who was fined by California regulators last week for political contribution reporting violations.</p>
<p>"We don't confirm or deny possible ongoing investigations," said a representative of the National Association of Securities Dealers, when asked about a $5,000 fine Grigsby paid to the California Fair Political Practices Commission.</p>
<p>A Securities and Exchange Commission representative also had no comment about the fine paid by Grigsby, president of Grigsby Brandford &amp; Co., Inc., one of the largest African American-owned municipal bond underwriters in the U.S.</p>
<p>Grigsby was unavalable for comment.</p>
<p>Christopher Taylor, executive director of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, an industry regulatory panel in Washington, said he did not know if SEC or NASD are examining Grigsby's contributions.</p>
<p>MSRB rules are approved by the SEC.</p>
<p>Taylor said the board's rule G-37, which curbs political contributions by bond firms to elected municipal officials, would not apply to the $53,500 in contributions made by Grigsby and entities he controlled in 1993.</p>
<p>That is because the rule did not take effect until April 1994, Taylor said.</p>
<p>But Taylor said pre-1994 contributions activity may be covered by longstanding MSRB rule G-17, which requires bond firms to deal fairly and ethically with muni bond customers.</p>
<p>He said MSRB notified bond dealers in 1993, when rule G-37 was proposed but not yet finalized, that their contributions could be covered by rule G-17 in the interim.</p>
<p>The California commission said last week that Grigsby made contributions totalling $11,500 in the first half of 1993. It also said Fiscal Funding Co., Inc. and other entities controlled by Grigsby made campaign contributions totaling $42,000.</p>
<p>The panel said Grigsby and Fiscal Funding failed to file timely major donor campaign statements reporting the contributions. Grigsby is a 50 percent owner and controlling partner of Fiscal Funding, an equipment leasing company.</p>
