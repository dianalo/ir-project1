<p>Australian Opposition treasury spokesman Gareth Evans said on Thursday that capital expenditure and wages figures released earlier pointed to the need for a further interest rate cut.</p>
<p>"Until now, very strong investment growth and concerns about future wages have been the only plausible barriers to further interest rate cuts," Evans said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Today's new figures have removed these barriers," he said.  </p>
<p>Official statistics released on Thursday showed that private new capital expenditure fell 2.4 percent, seasonally-adjusted, in the December quarter to an estimated A$10.27 billion from A$10.52 billion in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Private sector average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE) rose 0.8 percent in the three months to November for a rise of 2.8 percent on the year, while public sector earnings rose 2.2 percent in the quarter, to be up 7.6 percent over the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank has cut rates a total 1.5 percentage points since July, 1996.  </p>
<p>Its official overnight cash rate now stands at 6.0 percent.</p>
