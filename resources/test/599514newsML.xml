<p>Southeast Asian currency markets were mixed in a stable climate with the fall in the U.S. dollar lending support to the Singapore dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Singapore currency gained in line with the dollar's fall against the yen in the Asian morning, with funds unwinding length as dollar/yen slipped past 114, they said.</p>
<p>Before the release of Singapore's April non-oil exports this afternoon, dealers said investors had squared positions.</p>
<p>"We are expecting April to be slightly negative to up one percent, better than previous months," a dealer with a U.S. bank said, noting this spurred buying of the Sing dollar.</p>
<p>Dollar/Sing fell to an estimated low of 1.4285 but was quoted at 1.4290/1.4300 at 0400 GMT.</p>
<p>April non-oil exports released at 0358 GMT showed a higher increase of 5.9 percent on year, compared with 2.1 percent fall in March.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of 11 economists on Monday had predicted a tiny rise of 0.5 percent for April.</p>
<p>A dealer with another U.S. investment house said the rise in the export figure would underpin the Sing dollar and also cap dollar/Sing rises at 1.4300 in the short-term.</p>
<p>In Thailand, the baht improved with the weaker dollar and as foreign funds continued to raise short-term baht funds.</p>
<p>Dollar/baht fell to about 25.090/190 at 0400 GMT, down from the last fixing of the mid-rate by the Bank of Thailand at 25.78 per dollar on Monday.</p>
<p>Thai currencies were seen calmer but with investors still wary of volatility after recent moves by Asian central banks to squeeze out speculators.</p>
<p>"Players are still trying to out-guess the fund shortage. The rate is well bid, especially on 6-months," the dealer said.</p>
<p>Malaysia's ringgit recovered from an earlier low on renewed selling of dollar/ringgit as dollar/yen weakened.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was still speculation that Bank Negara intended to support the local currency around 2.4950/2.5000, where many banks were lined up to sell dollars.</p>
<p>Foreign funds were seen trying to get out of their positions and the dollar would be sold on rallies against the ringgit.</p>
<p>Dollar/ringgit was at 2.4990/2.5000.</p>
<p>Earlier, dealers said the ringgit was also pressured by sales for Sing dollars, although some resistance was seen at the 0.5710 level. The rate was at 0.5700/0.5707 at 0430 GMT.</p>
<p>In Indonesia, the rupiah was steady with the focus on the forward market but remained vulnerable to further potential turmoil linked to the upcoming general election.</p>
<p>Markets were tense about bouts of violence at the weekend and rumours of troops, on alert for fresh clashes, firing warning shots overnight, dealers said.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was quoted at 2,443.50/4.50 to the dollar at 0430 GMT, compared with Monday's 2,442.0/2,445.0.</p>
