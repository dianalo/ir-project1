<p>Triumphant independent filmmakers partied until the early hours on Tuesday after dominating the Academy Awards, while the major studios slunk home virtually empty-handed.</p>
<p>The independent film "The English Patient" took the lion's share of the Oscars at Monday's awards ceremony, walking away with nine Academy Awards including best picture and best director.</p>
<p>The place to be in the wee hours of Tuesday morning was the plush Mondrian Hotel in Hollywood, practically taken over by the Miramax studio in anticipation of a big night.</p>
<p>Miramax produced "The English Patient" and also had Oscar winners with "Sling Blade" in best adapted screenplay for Billy Bob Thornton, who also was nominated for best actor, and with "Emma," which won for best original musical or comedy score.</p>
<p>The entire first floor of the newly renovated hotel was given over to partying and on the 12th floor Hollywood royalty cavorted in private suites.</p>
<p>Even the fact that "The English Patient," a romance set in the Second World War, managed only one of the four acting category awards -- a best supporting actress Oscar for French-born Juliette Binoche -- did not stop the champagne from flowing.</p>
<p>With its nine Oscars, the film tied in third place on the all-time Academy Award-winning list with "Gigi" and "The Last Emperor." "Ben Hur" is the Oscar champion, taking 11 in 1959. "West Side Story" took home 10 awards in 1961.</p>
<p>In addition, it was a night of double honours for veteran producer Saul Zaentz at the 69th annual awards celebration presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences at the Shrine Auditorium.</p>
<p>As well as winning best picture for "The English Patient," the academy presented him with the coveted Irving G. Thalberg award for his considerable body of work.</p>
<p>In addition to Anthony Minghella's best director award for the "The English Patient," the film also garnered Oscars for art direction, cinematography, costume design, film editing, original dramatic score and sound.</p>
<p>Best actor went to Geoffrey Rush for his portrayal of mentally troubled Australian pianist David Helfgott in "Shine," produced by the independent Fine Line Features, while Frances McDormand took best actress for her portrayal of a pregnant police chief in the gritty crime drama "Fargo," another independent production, by Gramercy films.</p>
<p>The Miramax celebration was by no means the only party in town. Vanity Fair held its annual Oscar bash at trendy Morton's restaurant and Columbia-TriStar studios had a shindig at the Eclipse to celebrate the Sony picture division's only major Oscar, won by Cuba Gooding Jr. for best supporting actor for his role as a struggling professional football player in "Jerry Maguire," a TriStar production.</p>
<p>It was the only top Oscar won by a major studio.</p>
<p>Elton John's annual party at the Maple Drive restaurant to benefit his AIDS foundation turned into something more special at midnight as revellers celebrated the British singer's 50th birthday.</p>
<p>Also doing the rounds was Madonna, who was not nominated for her role in "Evita" as Eva Peron, the wife of Argentine strongman Juan Peron, but saw her song, "You Must Love Me," win the best song award for Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice.</p>
<p>Larry Flynt, the controversial publisher of "Hustler" magazine and the subject of the film, "The People vs. Larry Flynt," was partying with Woody Harrelson, who portrayed Flynt in the movie and just missed out on the best actor award.</p>
<p>Also on the party scene was boxing great Muhammad Ali, who received a standing ovation during the ceremonies when he took the stage with George Foreman, his opponent in a world heavyweight title bout in Zaire featured in "When We Were Kings," which won for best documentary feature.</p>
<p>Pianist Helfgott, who entertained the Oscar audience with some of the music from "Shine," was out partying with Rush.</p>
