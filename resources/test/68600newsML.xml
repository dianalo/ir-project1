<p>Captain Vladislav Savrda, as expected, has turned to Petr Korda and Daniel Vacek to play the doubles portion of their Davis Cup World Group semifinal tie against Sweden on Saturday.</p>
<p>Savrda had originally named Bohdan Ulihrach and Jiri Novak to face the Swedish pair of Nicklas Kulti and Jonas Bjorkman, but made it known that Korda and Vacek, his top two singles players, may be called to action at the last minute if needed.</p>
<p>Korda and Vacek paired up to beat favourites the U.S. in their quarterfinal tie, which proved to be the turning point in their 3-2 win over the reigning champions.</p>
<p>The two Czechs both lost their opening singles matches on Friday, leaving their team down 2-0 against the Swedes.</p>
<p>A win in the doubles by the Swedes would place them into the final against the winner of the second semifinal between France and Italy, which the Italians also lead 2-0.</p>
