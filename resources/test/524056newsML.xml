<p>NWE low sulphur straight-run offer levels picked up slightly on Monday on the back of last week's late deals, stronger crude and opening gambits by sellers, traders said.</p>
<p>Offer levels were $96 fob or higher. Bids were not loudly spoken with many buyers appearing willing to wait until the cargoes in the offing become imminent.</p>
<p>Although Brent futures have picked up, refiners appear not yet willing to make space in their plants to run much straight-run, sellers said.</p>
<p>Traders said the most obvious home for the material was still the United States. Around 200,000 tonnes is believed to have headed trans-atlantic in the last 10 days. - London newsroom +44 171 542 8060</p>
