<p>Paris Saint-Germain's 17-year-old sensation Nicolas Anelka has signed a two-year contract with English premier league club Arsenal starting in June, the daily newspaper Le Parisien said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It said Anelka, unhappy at PSG, had wanted to leave for some time and his decision had been helped by the fact that Frenchman Arsene Wenger was Arsenal's manager.</p>
<p>Anelka told the newspaper in an interview that he had signed a two-year deal, with an option to stay for two more years, on Tuesday and would leave PSG at the end of the season.</p>
<p>"People don't show enough confidence in me (at PSG)," the lanky young striker said. "At Arsenal, I've been assured that I would be on level terms with the other forwards.</p>
<p>"In France, there are other young players who play in the big teams. They've had their chance. There's only me who has played only one full match. I'm not leaving for the money, I'm leaving to play."</p>
<p>Le Parisien said Anelka had been anxious to settle his future since scoring his only first division goal for PSG against Lens on September 20.</p>
<p>His resolve to leave PSG appears to have been strengthened by the club's signing of another striker, former France international Cyrille Pouget, from Swiss club Servette on December 28.</p>
<p>PSG already have France's Patrice Loko and Panama's Julio Cesar Dely Valdes as their first-choice strikers.</p>
<p>PSG offered Anelka a six-year contract but had not yet met his father Jean-Philippe and his brothers, who act as his agents, to finalise the deal when Arsenal made contact with them on Monday.</p>
<p>All Anelka needs now is a letter from the French Football Federation (FFF) allowing him to leave PSG.</p>
<p>FFF regulations state that an apprentice must sign his first professional contract with his first club. But there is no such rule governing the movement of players between European clubs.</p>
