<p>Optus Communications Pty Ltd chairman Russell Fynmore said on Tuesday that the share market listing of Australia's second telecommunications carrier was still set for sometime later in calendar 1996.</p>
<p>"You might have heard that Optus Communications is planning to float sometime this year," he said in a luncheon speech to the Committee for the Economic Development of Australia (CEDA).</p>
<p>"Having said that, there is not much I am able to say about Optus' own future, except to confirm we are still on track for a listing sometime before the end of the year (subject to the necessary regulatory approvals)," he said.  </p>
<p>"Now I really can't say any more about our plans for Optus," Fynmore said in his speech, which otherwise dealt with industry deregulation from July next year and general competition issues.</p>
<p>The largest single shareholder in Optus is local transport and healthcare group Mayne Nickless Ltd with a 25 percent stake.</p>
<p>Next are two companies each with a 24.5 percent holding -- BellSouth Corp and Cable and Wireless Plc.</p>
<p>Other smaller shareholders include local life offices AMP Society and National Mutual, and the Australian government's investment group AIDC.</p>
