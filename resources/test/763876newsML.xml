<p>British Prime Minister Tony Blair said on Tuesday he had developed a strong working relationship with U.S. President Bill Clinton and revealed they were both ardent Chuck Berry fans.</p>
<p>"It is a strong relationship personally and politically," Blair told The Sun newspaper in an interview to mark his first three months in office since Labour's May 1 landslide election victory.</p>
<p>Blair's first months have been marked by a strengthening of ties between London and Washington. Clinton was fulsome in his praise of Blair when he paid an official visit to Britain in May.</p>
<p>Blair, returning the compliment, said: "I like President Clinton immensely. He is extraordinarily able and intelligent. We do have a lot in common."</p>
<p>He also confessed that the two were star-struck when they met rock legend Chuck Berry at the recent Denver summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations with Russia.</p>
<p>"It was really a mutual case of Wow! Never mind about meeting world leaders. This was a real superstar.</p>
<p>"President Clinton and I are both from the same generation who grew up with rock and roll and all the rest of it, and meeting Chuck Berry was a great moment for both of us."</p>
