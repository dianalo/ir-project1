<p>Australian building industry groups on Friday blamed the country's continuing high unemployment rate for a slight easing of the housing recovery in June.</p>
<p>"The poor unemployment figures in recent months appear to have dampened consumer confidence and led to this pressure on housing finance," Housing Industry Association Ltd managing director Ron Silberberg said in a statement.</p>
<p>Finance commitments for owner-occupied housing fell a seasonally-adjusted 2.1 percent by volume to 39,162 dwellings in June from the May level of 39,985.  </p>
<p>Official data released on Thursday showed Australia's unemployment rate rose to 8.7 percent in July from 8.5 percent a month earlier.</p>
<p>Unemployment has been stuck at or above 8.5 percent since the Liberal-National coalition won government in March 1996.</p>
<p>Master Builders Australia agreed that the high unemployment rate was suppressing the housing market and said the June housing finance figures showed that a sustained housing recovery was still some time away.  </p>
<p>"Housing demand has been tempered by low population growth, primarily due to a low immigration intake over the last five years," national deputy executive director Wilhelm Harnisch said in a statement.</p>
<p>"There has also been low employment growth coupled with the fact that most of the growth has been in part-time work which is exacerbating the weak recovery."</p>
