<p>U.S. blue chips slipped in late afternoon and tech stocks dipped near their session lows as investors cashed in on the market's scorching gains.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials hovered near the 8000 level, falling 41 points to 7998.  The Nasdaq Composite skidded 13 to 1568, apparently on its way to its first decline in two weeks.</p>
<p>"It's good, it's healthy," said Arnie Owen, managing director of capital markets at Cruttenden Roth. "Taking profits is the most wonderful thing a person can do."</p>
<p>Bonds turned slightly lower.  The benchmark 30-year U.S. Treasury fell 4/32 to yield 6.49 percent.</p>
