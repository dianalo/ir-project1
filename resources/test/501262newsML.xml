<p>South Africa media group Primedia Ltd said on Thursday it had bought a 69 percent stake in British marketing firm Mailcom for 40 million rand.</p>
<p>"The a rcquisition is in line with Primedia's policy of taking significant holdings in well managed businesses which have leadership positions in their sectors and offer opportunities for...growth," chief executive William Kirsh said in a statement.r</p>
<p>Kirsh said Mailcom would fall under its Primedia Direct unit which currently has 50 percent of the direct-to-home distribution industry in South Africa, distributing around 450 million pamphlets and catalogues a year to 5.5 million homes.</p>
<p>The buy will help the group develop an integrated marketing services operation and also help it expand offshore, he added.</p>
<p>"The remaining shareholding will belong to the entrepreneurial senior management team who have entered into service contracts with Primedia," Kirsh added.</p>
<p>The purchase price will be settled by a mix of cash from resources within South Africa and an issue of combined units.</p>
<p>Milton Keynes-based Mailcom operates in database marketing, direct mail processing, response handling, mail order, tele-marketing and provides direct marketing support services.</p>
