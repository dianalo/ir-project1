<p>The mark ended the European session clutching mild gains on most crosses, though narrow ranges held as players shrugged off new Franco-German vows that EMU would go ahead on time with the criteria fulfilled.</p>
<p>"The timetable will be respected. We have no doubt whatever on these points," French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said after a bilateral economic summit in Lyon, echoing assurances by Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer.</p>
<p>But with the market still fearful of EMU delay, its concerns were highlighted by leading German economist Herbert Hax, who repeated his view that monetary union should be postponed.  </p>
<p>"It is necessary to act taking into account the possibility the parameters for the euro might not be met," Hax, one of Germany's "wise men" advisers, told Italian radio.</p>
<p>"This doesn't mean relaxing the parameters but rather putting off the start of European Union for a year," he said.</p>
<p>The proposed stability council was also discussed at Lyon, with German Finance Minister Theo Waigel saying he would approve of an informal body.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer said the council would not control, supervise or be a counterweight to the European Central Bank.</p>
<p>Analysts said few surprises had emerged from Lyon.  </p>
<p>"Very little has come out at all. As expected, there was the commitment to EMU on time," said Gwyn Hacche, senior European economist at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>"We need to see more evidence on recovery coming through, particularly in Germany," he said. "When markets switch from ultra-gloom over the German economy to believing more in recovery coming through, then you'll probably get a period when there's less talk of delay."</p>
<p>The mark firmed against the Italian lira to 997.05/25 lire by 1625 GMT from late Tuesday's European level of 995.15/45. Dealers said earlier that the Bank of Italy had checked prices.  </p>
<p>The central bank checked mark/lira prices at around 996 lire per mark, but did not deal, traders said. At that time, the cross stood at around 995.70.</p>
<p>The French franc softened slightly to 3.3733/38 per mark from yesterday's close of 3.3712/15, while the peseta eased to 84.83/86 from 84.75.</p>
<p>Nordic currencies made mild gains during the session but most had rowed back to near previous European closing levels by late session.</p>
