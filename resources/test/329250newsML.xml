<p>Singapore's benchmark share index clambered higher on Thursday spurred by foreign fund buying of blue chips, but dealers said the market was likely to stabilise on Friday with few extra gains ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>"You can tell where most of the buying is coming from by looking at which shares are benefiting," said one dealer.</p>
<p>"The foreign tranches of most blue chips are rising while the local tranches, which foreigners can't touch, are unmoved."</p>
<p>The key 30-share Straits Times Industrials Index (STII) closed at 2,248.34, up 8.33 points. Total market volume was 266.7 million shares with 156 gainers and 229 losers.</p>
<p>Many of the gainers were stocks which have been favoured recently by brokers' recommendations.</p>
<p>Top gainer was sound-card maker Creative Technology which continued to benefit from a re-evaluation of the prospects for the electronics sector now the recent industry slump has ended.</p>
<p>Banks, property and food and beverage companies also rose.</p>
<p>The most active share was new listing Lung Kee Metal, which rose 63 percent from its initial public offer price of US$0.55 to a high of US$0.90 in the first few minutes of trade and then slipped back to close at US$0.79 with 36 million shares traded.</p>
