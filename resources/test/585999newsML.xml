<p>The Polish government has called for slower wage growth to keep economic reforms on track, but analysts said such restraint may prove politically difficult before parliamentary polls this year.</p>
<p>The political cost of any move to curb public sector wage growth before the election, due in September, would probably keep the government from taking decisive action.</p>
<p>"The benefits of a large-scale solution to curbing wage growth are long-term, while the political cost is immediate, making such a move unlikely ahead of elections," said Halina Franczak, analyst at the private Demoskop polling agency.</p>
<p>But the analysts said it was also unlikely that public sector salaries would grow quicker than envisaged in this year's budget.</p>
<p>"Additional wage increases, not already in the budget, are not likely, but neither are administrative decisions to curb wage growth," said Bohdan Wyznikiewicz, deputy head of the independent Gdansk Market Economics Research Institute.</p>
<p>The ruling ex-communists face a strong challenge from a right-leaning opposition alliance grouped around the Solidarity trade union, which is just behind them in recent opinion polls.</p>
<p>Government officials had recently said wage growth had to be curbed to slow the quick expansion of domestic demand, which has led to a dangerous widening of the trade deficit.</p>
<p>"We cannot allow wages to grow too quickly because if this occurs, they will later have to be painfully reduced," Finance Minister Marek Belka said earlier this week.</p>
<p>Average wages have been rising by about five percent in real terms during the first quarter of the year, after a six percent rise last year, according to Economy Ministry data.</p>
<p>"If growth in consumption is maintained, it may pose a threat to our reforms...Companies' managements ought to be disciplined as far as wage policy is concerned," Economy Minister Wieslaw Kaczmarek said this week.</p>
<p>The government has no say over wages in private firms but it can influence pay in state-owned companies, where levels are set annually by the so-called Trilateral Commission, a body of government, trade unions and employers' representatives.</p>
<p>The average wage in the enterprise sector was 1,073 zlotys ($340) per month in March.</p>
<p>The central bank has been trying to cool demand for goods, especially imported consumer products, by keeping interest and credit rates high against a background of falling inflation, but analysts said this policy had not effectively reduced growth in credit.</p>
<p>"Economists are somewhat surprised by the small effect that a tight monetary policy and high interest rates have on slowing credit action in Poland," said Krzysztof Bledowski, chief economist at WoodCommerz in Warsaw.</p>
<p>Analysts said rapid credit expansion was caused by an ever-larger number of Poles becoming eligible for loans and by improving risk-evaluation and credit policies by Polish banks, which have stepped up marketing campaigns.</p>
<p>Over the first quarter of 1997 credit action remained the fastest-growing component of money supply, increasing 8.5 percent, including a 10 percent rise in personal credit, against a 4.2 percent rise in broad money as a whole.</p>
