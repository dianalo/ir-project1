<p>Polish shares fell for the third consecutive session on Wednesday and analysts saw them extending losses in low turnover in the wait for the final decision on next year's income taxes.</p>
<p>The main market's WIG index fell 168.9 points, or 1.2 percent, to 13,547.4, and turnover rose 4.5 percent to 71.9 million zlotys ($25.7 million) on both markets as 62 issues fell, eight rose and 10 were flat.</p>
<p>"The stagnation is likely to last for some time as the market is awaiting a decision on income taxes next year," said Czeslaw Pospieszynski, an analyst at Bank Gdanski brokerage.</p>
<p>Some analysts said investors were waiting for the bourse to slide to about 13,200 or 12,900 points of the main market's WIG index and were holding back with buying until prices hit levels they considered attractive.</p>
<p>Analysts said a Senate vote this week in favour of the government's moderate tax cuts proposal might have a positive impact while the passage of the lower house's bill slashing taxes for the low-paid would be a negative signal.</p>
<p>But they said the impact of the vote, expected late on Wednesday or on Thursday, would be limited because the final decision rested with President Aleksander Kwasniewski, who has said he would veto a bill which would be economically unsound.</p>
<p>Analysts said October earnings reports, most of them due on Monday, could bring some optimism to the market, as they were expected to prove good.</p>
<p>Mass privatisation NFI units fell 2.5 percent in a 12.6-million zloty ($4.5 million) turnover in the regular bourse session and fell 3.3 percent in 13.3-million ($4.8 million) zloty continuous trade.</p>
