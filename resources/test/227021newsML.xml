<p>Ajax Amsterdam's miserable Dutch league season continued on Sunday when the defending champions were held 1-1 after Groningen's Dean Gorre scored a late equaliser.</p>
<p>Ajax dropped to sixth in the first division, 13 points behind leaders PSV Eindhoven, who beat NEC Nijmegen 4-1 on Saturday and have 42 points from 18 matches.</p>
<p>The Amsterdam team launched an early siege that was rewarded with a ninth minute goal from Ronald de Boer but Groningen, hovering just above the relegation zone, showed resolution.</p>
<p>Ajax's main problem, apart from constant injuries, is their repeated squandering of chances, though Patrick Kluivert did get the ball in the net midway through the second half, only for his effort to be disallowed for offside.</p>
<p>Groningen striker Harris Huizingh troubled the Ajax defence, crucially missing injured skipper Danny Blind and Frank de Boer, and it was finally breached in the 81st minute.</p>
<p>They failed to clear a Groningen attack efficiently, allowing Gorre the chance to fire the equaliser.</p>
<p>Ajax, who were knocked out of the Dutch Cup by second division side Heracles in midweek, face a vital last game in the European Cup Champions' League on Wednesday against Grasshopper Zurich, with a quarter-final place at stake.</p>
<p>Ajax coach Luis van Gaal said the result on Wednesday  would depend on the morale of his players. "In the dressing room I have seen very disappointed players," he said.</p>
<p>However, there is optimism that Frank de Boer will be fit enough to face the Swiss side.</p>
