<p>Shares in Carlton Communications Plc rose in early trading on Wednesday after the media group posted first-half results which met expectations, coupled with a positive trading statement, dealers said.</p>
<p>Recovering from Tuesday's near-year's low of 496p, the stock was up 18-1/2p at 517-1/2 by 0757 GMT in volume of 881,609 shares.</p>
<p>"The figures were as expected but the stock has been a bit of an underperformer," said one dealer.</p>
<p>He pointed out that Carlton shares had been hit this week by talk of weak advertising growth, yet the company's statement said ad revenues had been strong.</p>
<p>"There is a bit of a relief factor there," the dealer added.</p>
