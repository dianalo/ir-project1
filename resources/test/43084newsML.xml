<p>Payless Cashways Inc said Tuesday it plans to close nine underperforming stores, for which it took an after-tax store closing charge of $8.5 million in the August 24 third quarter.</p>
<p>The building materials specialty retailer also said its lenders agreed in principle to amend Payless Cashways' 1995 Credit Agreement to revise certain terms and to extend and increase available credit.  </p>
<p>The amended agreement was designed to provide the company with flexibility and liquidity to continue implementing its strategic plan.</p>
<p>Chairman David Stanley, in a statement, said "(It) will put to rest questions about the company's ability to meet its obligations. It is a long-term agreement -- through November 2000. The covenants are based on a realistic operating profile."</p>
<p>Payless did not identify the locations of the stores it plans to close. It operates 200 stores in 22 states.  </p>
<p>Payless Cashways also reported a third-quarter loss, including charges, of $0.61 per share compared to a year-ago profit of $0.17 per share.</p>
<p>Sales declined to $723.8 million from $737.2 million.</p>
<p>"In spite of intense new competition, comparable store sales results improved each month of the quarter," Stanley noted. "August's 2.5 percent increase was the highest since December 1994."</p>
