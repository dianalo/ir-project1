<p>Water industry regulator OFWAT said on Friday it would seek further rebates from South West Water, for which two bids were earlier blocked by the UK government.  </p>
<p>The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) decided not to permit proposed bids for South West Water from Severn Trent and Wessex Water.</p>
<p>South West Water said in May, announcing its annual results, that it would pay customers 10 stg as a rebate in July and hiked its dividend by 11.7 percent to 30.5 pence per share, but denied at the time either move was part of an effort to defend itself against the planned bids.</p>
<p>The following month it announced it would pay households 10 stg a day if supplies were disrupted due to drought, up to a maximum of the average annual charge paid the previous year.  </p>
<p>In a statement following the DTI deicision, director general of water services Ian Byatt said: "South West Water has improved its efficiency and shown itself ready to share this with customers in the form of rebates in advance of a price review."</p>
<p>"The company has said it intends to continue to share benefits with customers as well as shareholders. I will be pressing the company to deliver, at the earliest opportunity, rebates which go beyond those already given," said Byatt.</p>
<p>He welcomed the government's decision to block the bids for South West Water, saying mergers involving water and sewerage companies in particular were damaging to competition.</p>
