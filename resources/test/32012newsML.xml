<p>Turkey is planning the creation of a security cordon inside northern Iraq to curtail increasing Kurdish separatist activity along the porous border between the two countries, the foreign ministry said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"You call it what you like...It is question of five or 10 kilometres," a foreign ministry spokesman said, when asked how deep the security cordon would go. He said Turkey had asked the United States about the plan, but had not yet received a reply.</p>
<p>Foreign Minster Tansu Ciller had earlier said Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas in northern Iraq had massed on the border, prompting Turkey to take the "necessary measures".</p>
<p>"At the moment there is no question of us constantly sending soldiers there. But this does not mean that we are not going to intervene tomorrow and station soldiers there," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said Turkey did not plan on challenging Iraq's sovereignty or take over the area. Ankara had informed Baghdad and local Iraqi Kurdish groups of its intentions and wanted to pursue its plans in coordination with local groups.</p>
<p>Turkey has long been talking about increasing security of its long border with Iraq, by buying in electronic monitoring systems or permanetly increasing troops in the area. The security cordon has also been mooted in the past.</p>
<p>None of these plans have been realised.</p>
<p>"We have noted that to a large degree the terrorists have massed on our borders and there could be infiltrations of our borders," Ciller told reporters.</p>
<p>"In such a dangerous situation, Turkey is of course going to ensure border security and stop crossings," she said. "Turkey is going to evaluate what measures it will take with neighbouring countries and do what is necessary."</p>
<p>Ciller was speaking in a news conference about the situation in northern Iraq, where Iraqi troops helped an Iraqi Kurdish faction oust a rival group from the city of Arbil on Saturday, prompting U.S. missile attacks on Iraq on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Up to 35,000 Turkish troops poured into northern Iraq in March 1995 in their biggest cross-border incursion in pursuit of the PKK, which is fighting for control of southeast Turkey.</p>
<p>Ankara says instability in northern Iraq enables the PKK to set up bases there and attack Turkey.</p>
<p>"I believe it is best to interpret (Ciller's) remarks today as a warning to certain people and circles," Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel told reporters earlier on Wednesday, referring to the PKK.</p>
