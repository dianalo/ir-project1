<p>The dollar surged to hit a key resistance point of 118.50 yen in Tokyo trade on Wednesday, its highest level since March 1993.</p>
<p>It had earlier surged to a new 31-month high against the mark.  </p>
<p>Bids appeared to have emerged in an effort to trigger stop-loss buying orders lying in wait near 118.30 yen, with short-covering from 118.40 yen by dealers who had sold earlier in the day also helping to lift the greenback, a dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said that having topped the key technical point of 118.50 yen, the greenback was likely to head towards 120 yen.</p>
