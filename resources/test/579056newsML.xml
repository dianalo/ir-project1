<title>AUSTRALIA: Australia boosts defence spending.</title>

<p>Australia's conservative government on Tuesday announced a boost in defence spending to give the military more firepower and increase its ability to fight overseas.</p>
<p>Treasurer Peter Costello, announcing the budget for the fiscal year from July, said defence spending would increase to A$10.4 billion from A$10.0 billion, a two percent real rise.</p>
<p>It is the second consecutive year that defence has been shielded from across-the-board cuts aimed at wiping out the government deficit, forecast at A$3.853 billion in 1997/98.</p>
<p>Savings from defence staff and administrative cuts -- up to A$1 billion (US$780 million) a year -- would also be used to buy more weapons and upgrade existing firepower and facilities.</p>
<p>"The defence of Australia's interests is a task that this government takes very seriously," Defence Minister Ian McLachlan said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The development and maintenance of a more efficient, effective and capable defence force is therefore a priority."</p>
<p>New measures announced in the budget include upgraded weaponry, sonar and countermeasure equipment for the ANZAC class frigates, purchase of maritime seabed mines and new communications.</p>
<p>Since winning office 14 months ago, the Liberal-National government has abandoned the previous Labor administration's policy of largely limiting defence to protection of Australia's coastline and air and sea approaches.</p>
<p>McLachlan said last month that Australia was prepared to send its forces anywhere in the world to defence Australian interests and could even intervene in internal disputes in other countries.</p>
<p>Canberra and Washington also last year agreed to boost their defence cooperation and ability to jointly fight offshore.</p>
<p>Spending on equipment and stores would increase about five percent in 1997/98, a one percent real boost, with A$2.3 billion to be spent buying and upgrading weapons and equipment, McLachlan said.</p>
<p>The money will be spent on ongoing programmes to buy new ANZAC class frigates, Collins class submarines, transport aircraft, long-distance radar and light armoured vehicles, upgrades for F-111 bombers and F/A 18 fighters and to fund an already announced restructuring of the army.</p>
