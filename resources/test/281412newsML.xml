<p>After the two-test series ended in a washed out draw on Monday, England captain Mike Atherton has the chance to rescue something from the short tour of Zimbabwe in the last two one-day internationals in Harare.</p>
<p>The first of these is on Wednesday and the second on Friday. Zimbabwe already lead the series 1-0 after a two-wicket win in Bulawayo.</p>
<p>Atherton is aware that patience with his captaincy is beginning to run out and realises that his team are in a "must win" situation.</p>
<p>"We're one down and we have to win these two games to take the series. It's as simple as that and that's what we'll be looking to do," he said.</p>
<p>"But now that Craig White has arrived I think we're in a better position. He's an all-rounder and that's what you need in one day cricket".</p>
<p>Atherton, however, has played down the increasing pressure which a string of low scores has put on his shoulders. His form with the bat in Zimbabwe brought him just 34 runs in four test innings and, like his leadership, his batting is now under close scrutiny.</p>
<p>"I would have liked to have scored some runs in this Zimbabwe series but now it's just a case of looking forward to New Zealand," he said.</p>
<p>"I have had a worse test trot before now so it's nothing new. But this has been a short test series and quite a compact itinerary.</p>
<p>"There will be a bit more time when we get to New Zealand with a few four-day games in particular before the test series starts there."</p>
<p>England may make just one change to the test side with Phil Tufnell making way for Yorkshire seamer Chris Silverwood.</p>
<p>White may well find himself in the starting line-up alongside Ronnie Irani although the Essex all-rounder is still struggling with a bad back.</p>
<p>Even if he is fit, though, England will still face a tough job.</p>
<p>They have a poor one-day record against Zimbabwe and were outplayed in the opening game. They also face a side clearly annoyed by Atherton's comments after the second test.</p>
<p>The England captain said that his team would have won both tests given good weather, a remark that irritated Zimbabwe captain Alistair Campbell.</p>
<p>"That's just the kind of comment that gees us up. We feel that we are a good match for England and we have a better balanced side," said Campbell.</p>
<p>Zimbabwe are likely to replace paceman Henry Olonga with either all-rounder Craig Evans or seamer John Rennie.</p>
