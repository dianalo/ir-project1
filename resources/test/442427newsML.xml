<p>Pressure on Mexican peso contracts had eased slightly by mid-morning on Thursday.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the peso was still toying with the eight-per-dollar mark as the market braced itself for the U.S. House of Representatives vote on decertifying Mexico as a drug war ally, traders said.</p>
<p>"The peso opened under great pressure, then some stepped in to sell (dollars)," a trader said.</p>
<p>The benchmark 48-hour peso and its 24-hour counterpart stood 3.2 and 2.5 centavos weaker, respectively, at 7.9980/8.0020 and 7.9860/7.9910 per dollar.</p>
