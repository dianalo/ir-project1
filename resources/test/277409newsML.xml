<p>The dollar rose above 115 yen in morning Tokyo trade on Thursday for the first time in over 44 months, supported by falls in Tokyo stock prices, dealers said.</p>
<p>By mid-morning, the dollar had risen as high as 115.06 yen.</p>
<p>Dealers said triggering of dollar purchases just above 115 yen, placed in advance to cut losses on existing positions, was the direct cause of the rise.</p>
<p>But they said the greenback had been supported from morning trade on expectations of commercial purchases and fragile Tokyo share prices.</p>
<p>The recent weakness in stock prices has strengthened the view that Japan will be forced to keep its interest rates at record lows, hurting yen sentiment and giving the dollar support.</p>
