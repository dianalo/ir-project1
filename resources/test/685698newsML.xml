<p>Poland's parliament on Wednesday rejected a bid by the ruling ex-communists to call a referendum on whether to continue to allow abortion for so-called social reasons such as a pregnant woman's financial hardship.</p>
<p>The decision is a blow to supporters of liberalised abortion and means that within a few months pregnant women are likely to find it harder to terminate a pregnancy.</p>
<p>Deputies voted by 197 to 178 with 14 abstentions to throw out the proposal for a vote on abortion at the same time as parliamentary elections on September 21.</p>
<p>The secular-minded ruling Democratic Left Alliance (SLD) and some opposition deputies last year liberalised the previous restrictive abortion law to allow terminations, up to the 12th week of pregnancy, for women who had financial or other personal problems.</p>
<p>The change was opposed by rightist parties and the Roman Catholic Church, which fought to retain the former 1993 law allowing abortion only for such cases as irreparable damage to the foetus, serious danger to the life or health of the mother or when pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.</p>
<p>Last month anti-abortion campaigners got a boost when Poland's Constitutional Tribunal ruled that the amended law clashed with constitutional guarantees of the right to life.</p>
<p>This means parliament must tighten the law again within six months, unless supporters of easier abortion can muster the two-thirds of votes needed to overturn the tribunal ruling -- which is unlikely in this parliament or the next.</p>
<p>The ex-communists, calling the tribunal ruling politically-inspired, suggested a referendum, while the Church and its political allies, who view abortion as killing, argued that such moral questions could not be decided this way.</p>
<p>The referendum would have allowed the ex-communists to separate the abortion question, over which Poles are divided into almost equal camps, from other election issues.</p>
<p>But even President Aleksander Kwasniewski, who once led the ex-communists and is now trying to mend fences with the Church, opposed the referendum proposal.</p>
<p>The abortion issue has already begun to figure strongly in campaigning for the elections which will pit the ex-communists, now in power with a Peasant party, against Solidarity Election Action (AWS), a pro-Church alliance of rightist parties led by the Solidarity trade union.</p>
<p>The SLD and AWS are competing for the lead in opinion polls, each with backing of between 20 and 30 percent.</p>
<p>The anti-abortion cause received a boost from Pope John Paul's 11-day visit to his homeland earlier this month, during which he strongly condemned the practice.</p>
