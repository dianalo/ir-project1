<p>Continental Can Co Inc said on Tuesday it agreed to buy an additional 34 percent of Plastic Containers Inc, or PCI, for $30 million from Merrywood Inc.</p>
<p>Also as part of the agreement, Merrywood will receive warrants to purchase 150,000 shares of Continental Can stock at about $20 each, the company said.</p>
<p>Continental Can said it was obligated to purchase the remaining 16 percent of Merrywood's stake in PCI by December 31, 2000, at a price of $15.4 million, plus interest.  </p>
<p>The company said it would obtain the funds necessary to purchase the Merrywood interest through a loan from PCI. In turn, PCI expects to enter into a $45 million sale and leaseback of some of its facilities and to refinance its outstanding senior secured notes.</p>
<p>PCI has tendered for its existing senior notes subject to the completion of a new senior note offering. When the tender is completed, PCI will incur an extraordinary charge for debt retirement and the write-off of unamortized fees, which will amount to about $7 million.</p>
<p>Continental Can said it expected all transactions to be completed in 1996.</p>
