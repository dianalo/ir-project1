<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) on Friday cancelled transactions in shares of state-run Bank of Baroda which were listed earlier in the day, brokers said.</p>
<p>They said BSE had flashed an announcement on their online trading systems which said transactions conducted on Friday in shares of Bank of Baroda had been annulled.  </p>
<p>The exchange had earlier suspended the shares due to confusion arising from the simultaneous listing of its partly- and fully-paid shares.</p>
<p>Brokers said early trade was confused as most investors were unsure which price quotes reflected the shares they held. Both shares listed at around 35 rupees.</p>
<p>In its initial public offer last December, the bank issued 100 million shares of 10 rupees face value at 85 rupees a share.</p>
<p>For retail investors, employees and banks, Bank of Baroda collected 25 rupees on application and 25 rupees on allotment. The balance will be collected later in the year.</p>
<p>Shares issued to non-resident Indians, overseas corporate bodies and foreign institutional investors were fully-paid shares at 85 rupees each.</p>
