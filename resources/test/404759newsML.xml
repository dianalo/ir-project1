<p>The Treasury substantially increased its current account balance with the Bank of Spain in 1996, Budget Secretary Jose Folgado said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>This was a defensive measure to offset any possible change in market expectations ahead of Europe's planned single currency, he said.</p>
<p>"We thought it was a good policy to have a big cushion for this account to counterbalance any possibile market volatility in a year so crucial as 1997," Folgado told a parliamentary committee.</p>
<p>The Spanish Treasury's current account balance rose by 967.6 billion pesetas during 1996 to 2,529 billion pesetas in December 1996 from 1,561 billion pesetas at end of 1995.</p>
<p>That increase was due to favourable market conditions and to the downtrend in interest rates, Folgado explained.</p>
