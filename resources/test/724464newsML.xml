<p>Tension rose across Spain on Saturday and political leaders prepared massive street protests as the clock ticked away to a deadline set by ETA Basque guerrillas for the death of a young politician.</p>
<p>The Basque separatist rebels set a 4 p.m. (1400 GMT) ultimatum to the government to move some 500 ETA inmates to prisons in their homeland.</p>
<p>Otherwise they would kill Miguel Angel Blanco, a town councillor from the ruling Popular Party whom they kidnapped on Thursday.</p>
<p>City and town centres were blocked off for demonstrations, television and radio aired special programmes and political leaders converged on the northern Basque region as the government called on the population to take to the streets in a mass protest.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar planned to lead what organisers said would be Spain's largest demonstration ever against ETA in the streets of the Basque capital Bilbao at midday.</p>
<p>Side by side with with fierce nationalist Basque leader Jose Antonio Ardanza, Aznar was to carry the only banner: "Peace now and forever".</p>
<p>Short of a last-minute rescue, officials feared they could do little to save Blanco's life after the government ruled out any concessions to what it calls a "band of terrorists".</p>
<p>"Today cannot be just another day," Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said in a widely quoted a television address. "We have to put out every bit of our moral strength."</p>
<p>Media commentators warned that silence was complicity and urged people to cooperate with police to find Blanco and show solidarity in protest against Basque separatist violence.</p>
<p>"Raise a unanimous voice so that the terrorist organisation does not carry out its death threat," the leading daily El Pais said in a front page editorial. "The chill provoked by this latest ETA villainy will not stop us shouting out for the freedom of Miguel Angel Blanco, which is also the freedom of everyone."</p>
<p>ETA has killed about 800 people since 1968 when it began a campaign for an independent Basque state encompassing parts of northern Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>The rebels have set deadlines to execute kidnap victims twice before, in 1981 and 1983, and in both cases the hostages were killed.</p>
<p>Hundreds of police and Civil Guards scoured the area around the Basque town of Ermua where the 29-year-old Blanco was last seen on Thursday at 3 p.m. boarding a train to go to work.</p>
<p>The outcry against Blanco's capture echoed around the world with the Vatican, human rights group Amnesty International and the European Union all weighing in with pleas for his release.</p>
<p>All Basque politicial parties, with the exception of ETA's political arm Herri Batasuna, condemned the kidnap and urged the government not to give in to blackmail.</p>
<p>On Friday thousands of Spaniards packed town hall squares in a silent protest. Among those who appealed to the guerrillas to spare Blanco's life were former members of ETA and a Herri Batasuna deputy in the Navarre region parliament.</p>
<p>In a dramatic phone call to state radio, the mother of one ETA prisoner pleaded with her son and his colleagues to spare Blanco's life. "You were all against the death penalty, what are you doing now?" she asked.</p>
