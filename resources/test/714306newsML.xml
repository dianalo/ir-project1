<title>USA: CME hog and pork belly futures expected lower.</title>
<headline>CME hog and pork belly futures expected lower.</headline>

<p>CME lean hog futures were expected to open 0.100 to 0.250 cent per lb lower while pork belly futures were called 0.250 to 0.500 cent a lb lower, livestock analysts said.</p>
<p>Carryover selling is expected in lean hogs, linked to the steady to mostly lower cash hog indications and continued weakness in cash pork prices. Hog runs are light but packer bids are down, influenced by somewhat poor demand for pork items, analysts said.</p>
<p>Demand for pork is running much less than anticipated both from domestic interests and for export, they said.</p>
