<p>French cargo charter airline, Aero Charter Darta, said it had made around 20 flights over the past week or so on behalf of shippers and forwarders who had decided to transfer traffic from road to beat truck barricades.</p>
<p>"If we'd had the means available we could have made 100 flights such is the demand at present," Aero Charter Darta's commercial manager, Andre Rouille, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The airline's fleet of small aircraft - King Air, Metroliner, Grumann G1 and Fokker 27 with cargo capacities ranging from 400 kilos to nearly five tonnes - had been fully deployed carrying "just-in-time" shipments - mainly automotive parts and computer components - on ex-France routes to European destinations.</p>
<p>With the main Channel ports blocked and Chunnel shuttle services suspended, one of the most popular destinations had been the UK.</p>
<p>Aero Charter Darta had operated flights from small French airports, such as Caen and Le Havre, to Coventry and London.</p>
<p>"The cost of chartering a small cargo plane works out at several thousands of francs but this compares with four million francs for every hour an assembly line is out of action so shippers see it as value for money," Rouille said.</p>
<p>The charter airline had also been approached to fly 20 tonnes of orange juice to the UK aboard its Hercules aircraft but the shipper finally decided against the idea.</p>
<p>Aero Charter Darta had also made flights from France to northern Italy, northern Spain and Portugal while its Hercules had made a charter flight to the Middle East with a cargo that had been blocked in traffic en route to a scheduled flight at Charles de Gaulle airport, Rouille added.</p>
<p>Talks resumed this afternoon to try and resolve the lorry drivers' dispute which began on November 18. - Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017</p>
