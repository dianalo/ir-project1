<title>USA: Protest comic books target Disney on Haiti.</title>

<p>One item handed out at Walt Disney Co's summer movie "Hercules" differs from the usual for-profit souvenirs -- a coloring book in which the film's cartoon stars call for better conditions for workers in Haiti.</p>
<p>"Will Hercules do the right thing -- or will he slowly turn into a greedy, complacent has-been just like Disney's leaders?" the book asks, saying workers at Disney-licensed plants in the Caribbean country make just $0.28 per hour.</p>
<p>The Disney movie is based on the myth of Hercules, an ultra-strong ancient Greek.</p>
<p>The Miami Herald Friday quoted a member of a group called the Modern Action Club, which is distributing the coloring books, as saying they were first distributed in June at Disney's Hercules kickoff parade in New York.</p>
<p>Disney officials were not immediately available for comment. The company has denied allegations that workers are exploited at plants in Haiti that manufacture Disney-licensed products. It says it has a code of conduct for its licensees and their manufacturers that is strictly monitored and enforced.</p>
