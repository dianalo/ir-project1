<p>Warplanes supporting Taleban forces on Wednesday bombed Jabal-os-Siraj, a stronghold of the ousted Afghan government where its military chief Ahmad Shah Masood is sometimes based, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Two bombs landed near Masood's base, one exploding harmlessly in a field and the other damaging a house but causing no injuries.</p>
<p>The 10 people living in the damaged house and eight other families immediately packed up and left the area.</p>
<p>The attack at about 9 a.m. was accompanied by frantic anti-aircraft fire as truck-mounted guns attempted to bring the plane down. A bombing run on Jabal os-Siraj on Tuesday sent two bombs into a hillside north of the town.</p>
<p>Citizens turned out in the streets to listen to the anti-aircraft fire. They also cursed Pakistan, which they believe to be the main supporter of the Taleban militia that forced the government out of Kabul on September 27.</p>
<p>Pakistan has supported the Taleban but has denied supplying military aid.</p>
<p>Jabal os-Siraj, about 90 km (60 miles) north of Kabul, occupies a strategic junction where the main highway continues north through the Salang Pass and a fork goes northeast into the Panjsher Valley, Masood's lair.</p>
<p>The purist Islamic Taleban, born in the refugee camps along the Afghan-Pakistan border two years ago, have faced their first serious reverses in the past week as guerrilla mastermind Masood swept from his Panjsher Valley stronghold.</p>
<p>Sealing pacts with fellow northern militia leader Abdul Rashid Dostum -- an Uzbek commander and once a rival -- and with other regional leaders, Masood has pushed south through the towns of Jabal os-Siraj and Charikar towards Kabul.</p>
<p>Witnesses said on Wednesday planes could also be heard over Charikar, about 10 km (six miles) to the south of Jabal os-Siraj.</p>
<p>Charikar was bombed on Monday when nine persons were killed and six were wounded, all civilians. The town was also hit by warplanes on Tuesday afternoon but there were no casualties.</p>
<p>Witnesses said fighting continued around Bagram military air base, 50 km (30 miles) north of the capital, where Masood forces earlier said they had taken all but a corner of the strategic airfield.</p>
