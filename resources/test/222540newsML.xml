<p>A Russian poultry farm came up trumps when a three-tonne whale washed up on a beach near the Arctic port city of Murmansk, Itar-Tass news agency said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Tass said the cash-strapped poultry farm had turned the whale into meat and bonemeal to feed its chickens. "The incident came as a windfall for the farm, which is living through a serious financial crisis," it said.</p>
