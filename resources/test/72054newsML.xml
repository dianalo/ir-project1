<p>Telident Inc said on Tuesday sales for the fourth quarter ended June 30 were hurt by orders from two distributors.</p>
<p>The company earlier reported sales of $680,000 for the quarter, compared to $1.1 million a year ago and a loss of $0.14 per share, compared to a profit of $0.01 a share a year ago.</p>
<p>"The temporary slowdown in sales is attributable to two distributors who originally stocked inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1995 and did not have the same volume of orders in fiscal 1996," President Michael Miller said.</p>
<p>"We are encouraged by the current backlog of orders, which approximates $500,000 and will be shipped in the first quarter of fiscal 1997," he said.</p>
