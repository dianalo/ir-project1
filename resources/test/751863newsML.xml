<p>Xerox Corp chief financial officer Barry Romeril said that as the dollar continues to strengthen against every currency, he expects a bigger hit to earnings in the second half of 1997 versus the first half.</p>
<p>"As exchange rates have worsened, the second half impact will be greater," Romeril said in a telephone interview, adding that he expects a "bit more than $0.10, a bit less than $0.20," negative impact to earnings for the second half.</p>
<p>In the first two quarters, Xerox saw a negative impact from currency of about $0.05 or so to earnings.  But it also had a gain of $0.04 a share from its Rank deal.  </p>
<p>In June Xerox acquired Rank Group Plc's remaining interest in Rank Xerox, which will add at least $0.10 a share to earnings in the second half of the year, Romeril said.</p>
<p>"In the second half we expect at least a $0.10 improvement over the prior year as a result of the deal we did," he said.</p>
<p>Romeril also said that Xerox's digital revenues continue to show strong growth and are improving each quarter.  He said that in the first half of the year, Xerox launched many new digital copier and printer products, "which hardly registered in the first half" in terms of revenues.</p>
<p>He said digital revenues should improve going forward.  </p>
<p>"We will certainly see a big surge in the digital products that were introduced in the first half," he said, but he declined to be more specific.  He also said that Xerox introduced new light lens products as well.</p>
<p>Light lens copiers are Xerox's older, analog copiers, which are slowly declining as more companies convert to digital copiers.  Digital copiers can also be connected to a computer network and double as printers and fax machines.</p>
<p>"Incrementally, it will lead to revenue growth," Romeril said. "Our target is to get to double-digit revenue growth."</p>
<p>Xerox's Q2 revenues were up six percent, before currency.  </p>
<p>"We have launched and have been launching new products that will take us to the 10 percent goal," he said, adding that the goal is "foreseeable in the next few quarters."</p>
<p>He said that in the second quarter, Xerox saw a "big progress" in the U.S., "excellent" sales in Brazil, and saw "huge growth" in the "non-Japan" parts of Asia not addressed by Fuji Xerox Co Ltd, its equally-owned joint venture with Fuji Photo Film Co Ltd.  "Europe remains soft," he said.</p>
<p>"We are optimistic," about the rest of the year, Romeril said.  He said he would not comment on analysts' 1997 full year estimates, which range from $3.85 to $3.97 a share, according to First Call, with a consensus of $3.94 a share.</p>
