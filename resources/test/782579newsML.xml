<p>The Financial Accounting Standards Board's latest derivatives accounting proposals have now come under fire from Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan who has sided with the nation's top corporate executives.</p>
<p>Not only did Greenspan tell the accounting board to slow down and allow more time for industry input on the controversial standards, he recommended the board consider a different proposal altogether.</p>
<p>"While we support FASB's objective of promoting greater transparency of derivatives in financial statements, the proposal continues to take a piecemeal approach to fair value accounting, which raises a number of concerns," Greenspan wrote in a July 31 letter to the independent board, which sets the accounting guidelines companies must use.</p>
<p>Greenspan recommended the accounting board, as an alternative, require companies to describe their derivatives holdings more rather than change how firms report related gains and losses each quarter in their financial statements.</p>
<p>His comments came after a group of top executives from major U.S. companies last week complained the accounting panel's pending rules might have a bad impact on the markets, which has become a heightened concern among market players as the Dow Jones industrial average has reached all-time highs.</p>
<p>Officials at the accounting board have been working on the rules for several years but recently picked up their pace under pressure from Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt, seeking completion by year-end.</p>
<p>The proposals aim to shed light on the fluctuating values of the financial derivatives companies buy to offset their risks from other investments.</p>
<p>The rules require that all derivatives be recognised in the financial statement. Gains and losses resulting from changes in fair values would be accounted for depending on the use of the derivatives.</p>
<p>Officials at both the SEC and the accounting board fear investors are provided with little information about how the derivatives companies own fluctuate in value.</p>
<p>Despite those concerns, in his four-page letter Greenspan outlined many problems with the rules. He noted that companies may actually avoid using derivatives to offset risks because of the red tape involved.</p>
<p>"The proposal may discourage prudent risk management activities and in some cases could present misleading financial information," Greenspan said.</p>
