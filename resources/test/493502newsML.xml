<p>The Slovak central bank said favourbale first quarter state budget results have delayed any reason for the state to seek international monetary sources, the economic daily Hospodarske Noviny reported on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The paper also quoted NBS Vice-governor Marian Jusko as saying the budget figures, which showed a surplus of around 400 million crowns as of last Friday, also meant the finance ministry did not need to open its treasury bill auctions directly to foreign participants.  </p>
<p>"The develpoment (of the budget) in the first quarter gives no reason for the finance ministry to change its policy and allow foreign participation in its treasury bills auctions," Jusko said.</p>
<p>Foreigners are allowed to buy Slovak T-bills, but only through registered Slovak brokers.</p>
<p>"Furthermore, the question of issuing an international bond to cover the 1996 budget deficit will become topical only in September when treasury bills issued for this purpose will mature," he added.  </p>
<p>The 1997 budget plans a 36.9 billion crown deficit, up from a 25.5 billion crown shortfall in 1996. The 1997 budget allows for the finance ministry is to issue a total 70 billion crowns in state securities this year to finance the deficits of both years.</p>
<p>Jusko was reacting to a recent statement by the finance ministry that high interbank money market rates made it expensive to refinance the budget and that it was seriously considering issuing an international bond.</p>
<p>Rates on the interbank market on Tuesday ranged from 19 percent for overnight funds to 20.3 percent for three month money.</p>
<p>Finance Ministry officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Last January, the ministry said it may allow foreign investors access to treasury bill auctions to help refinance the state budget deficit.</p>
<p>High interbank rates are a result of a liquidity shortage on the domestic money market which began at the beginning of the year after central bank moves to reduce consumption-led credit expansion at commercial banks.</p>
<p>Last Wednesdy the ministry rejected all bids in its state bond auction, when it considered banks demands for yields of up to 22 percent as "unacceptably high."</p>
