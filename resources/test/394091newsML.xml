<p>Chinese police on Friday detained a man in Beijing's Tiananmen Square as he carried a wreath apparently dedicated to late patriarch Deng Xiaoping, witnesses said.</p>
<p>Between 20 and 30 plainclothes police rushed up to the unidentified man as he walked from a subway entrance towards the Martyrs' Monument in the square.</p>
<p>He was bundled into a car along with the wreath, on which the words "Deng Xiaoping" were written on a ribbon, a witness said.</p>
<p>No further details were available on the incident, which was an indication of heightened security in the politically sensitive square following the death of China's paramount leader Deng on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Tiananmen Square was the focus of huge student-led protests crushed by the military on June 4, 1989, in a crackdown ordered by Deng.</p>
<p>A funeral ceremony for Deng is scheduled to be held in the Great Hall of the People next to the square on Tuesday.</p>
