<p>KCBT wheat futures closed lower on talk India had cancelled a tender for 500,000 tonnes of optional origin wheat, traders said.</p>
<p>Pressure also came from a sharp drop in deferred CBOT soybean contracts and on a decline in CBOT wheat futures, they said.</p>
<p>"We were up early on commission house buying but profit taking took it down again," a trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said Benson Quinn was an early buyer of six million bushels of July and E.D. and F. Man International was an early buyer of two million bushels of July, they said.</p>
<p>The market found support early on USDA's March 31 planting intentions report and quarterly stocks data, traders said.</p>
<p>USDA Monday said U.S. farmers this year would plant 69.187 million acres of wheat, below an average of analysts' estimates for 70.1 million. USDA said the stocks of wheat in the U.S. as of March 1 totaled 822 million bushels, below expectations for 827 million acres.</p>
<p>KCBT hard red winter wheat closed four to 6-1/4 cents per bushel lower, with May down 6-1/4 at $4.22-1/2.</p>
