<p>Argentine President Carlos Menem came out strongly in support of Economy Minister Roque Fernandez Tuesday after he was alleged by his predecessor of being "not capable or not honest."</p>
<p>At the end of a visit in La Paz, Menem described Fernandez as "exceptional, capable, low profile, and above all, hard-working and honest," the Argentine news agency DyN reported.</p>
<p>Former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo, who is heading an anti-corruption crusade, lashed out at Fernandez on Monday for describing as "normal" a businessman Cavallo accuses of graft.  </p>
<p>Cavallo, fired by President Carlos Menem in July after being credited for reforming the Argentine economy, is battling in the courts with Alfredo Yabran, a businessman close to Menem, whom he says heads a "mafia" or crime ring in the customs and postal services. Yabran denies the accusations.</p>
<p>"I have said that Fernandez was a capable and honest man. A capable and honest man does not commit these mistakes. One or the other, either he is not capable or he is not honest," the former minister told local television after Fernandez said he believed Yabran was a "normal businessman."</p>
<p>Menem's Peronist government includes several senior officials who have also been accused by Cavallo of corruption and have threatened to sue him.</p>
