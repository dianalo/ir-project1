<p>Russia's Tax Service head, faced with a 90 percent collection rate in the first half of 1997, said on Wednesday the service should rummage around everywhere for more money -- from national power utility Unified Energy System (UES) to magicians and healers.</p>
<p>"We must have a look into all untraditional spheres -- all these...magicians, healers, wholesale markets, railway stations, which have turned into bazaars -- and bring them into our view," Alexander Pochinok told a Tax Service meeting.</p>
<p>"We shall have to shake everyone who has never come under our attention. Such regulations are ready -- you need to shake, shake and shake."</p>
<p>The state coffers received 123.9 trillion roubles ($21.3 billion) in tax in the first half of 1997, or 90 percent of the budgeted volume, Tax Revenues Analysis Department head Andrei Ilyin said.</p>
<p>Pochinok ordered a thorough check on UES and the Railway Ministry, and said the Tax Office and Tax Police were already seizing their property and accounts.</p>
<p>"Debts on all these systems must be paid -- the deadline is December 1," Pochinok said. "Not a single kopeck, either of the Railway Ministry or UES, must be lost. Turn them inside out, check all their sources of tax evasion."</p>
<p>UES chairman Boris Brevnov said last week the company owed 5.60 trillion roubles in back taxes.</p>
<p>Pochinok said Russia's biggest tax arrears were shared among its biggest companies.</p>
<p>As of July 1, car-maker AO AvtoVAZ topped the list of non-payers with 2.8 trillion roubles of tax arrears.</p>
<p>Next come oil companies AOOT Yuganskneftegaz with 1.7 trillion roubles, OAO Noyabrskneftegaz with 1.6 trillion roubles and AOOT Kondpetroleum and AOOT Nizhnevartovskneftegaz with 800 billion roubles each.</p>
<p>Metals producer AO Norilsk Combine owes 600 billion roubles in overdue taxes, power utility PEO Tatenergo 700 billion roubles and oil refinery AO Omsky NPZ 600 billion roubles, the Tax Service said in a statement.</p>
<p>The low rate of tax collection has long been one of Russia's most serious problems, causing massive non-payments to public employees and pensioners, slowing industry's development and forcing the government to go to international markets for funds.</p>
<p>President Boris Yeltsin has ordered the government to pay off over 30 trillion roubles of wage arrears by January 1, 1998, but the government owes a further 76 trillion roubles to firms.</p>
<p>It has already paid about 22 trillion roubles in pension arrears by shaking up natural gas monopoly Gazprom , which paid taxes of 14.5 trillion roubles.</p>
<p>Pochinok said the Tax Service should start preparing documents on tax non-payers for the government's emergency committee meetings. "I do not know how you will do that, but it must be done," he said repeatedly. ($ = 5807 Russian Roubles)</p>
