<p>IMM currency futures ended mostly lower after the Swiss franc slumped in busy trading.</p>
<p>The Swiss unit tumbled to a daily loss of nearly $0.0100 in a spurt of business that hit waves of sell stops as support levels gave way.</p>
<p>"Everybody was buying it all the way down and that's why it kept going," quipped one harried floor broker, who added that these buyers "were not happy campers."</p>
<p>"Everybody was buying and saying, 'Boy, was this a mistake'...(but) if you'd looked at the D-mark, you'd buy Swiss because the mark didn't move much."  </p>
<p>The downmove in Swiss francs, which analysts linked partly to sentiment that the Swiss unit remains overvalued, was already in motion when market talk about easing of Swiss banking secrecy laws hit the trading floor.</p>
<p>"That accelerated it," said one floor broker.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Swiss Foreign Ministry said later on Thursday that easing of Switzerland's strict laws on banking secrecy might be eased as early as December or January rather than in April 1997.</p>
<p>The Swiss franc broke back below key support levels and matched the contract low at $0.7897.  </p>
<p>The pullback enlivened the market from a quiet afternoon following muted response when October's Chicago purchasing managers index rose to 56.9 versus forecasts for 54.0.</p>
<p>"Honestly, I kind of think the currency moves today in large part are position-squaring," said an analyst, noting that Friday is a holiday in parts of Europe and that traders also hesitated before the October U.S. jobs report.</p>
<p>Dec yen fell $0.00008 to $0.008822, marks lost $0.0034 to $0.6605, Swiss fr slid $0.0092 to $0.7914, pound off $0.0062 to $1.6260, Canadian dollar rose $0.0021 to $0.7491, Aussie dollar rose $0.0003 to $0.7908, Mex peso rose $0.000975 to $0.121625. -Derivatives Desk(312)408-8750/E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com</p>
