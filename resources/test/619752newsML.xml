<p>The Slovak SAX index lost another 1.43 points in listless trading on the Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) on Wednesday with brokers blaming the current instability on the money markets.</p>
<p>"Current instability on the money market has been completely paralyzing the activity on the stock exchange," Dusan Sykora of ING Barings said.</p>
<p>Sykora said that political turbulence after the failed referendums at the weekend marred any chances for a revival on the share market for a long time to come.</p>
<p>"I think that nothing else but time can help this," he added.</p>
<p>Oil refiner Slovnaft dominated trading on the bourse floor with 2,592 traded shares, closing up five at 1,040 crowns.</p>
<p>"However, there is still a theoretical hope that Slovak shares will become more interesting soon, as their prices seem to be already falling," Sykora said.</p>
<p>Overall volume fell to 171,313 shares, from 463,565 shares traded on Tuesday, while turnover decreased to 45.36 million crowns, from 118.53 million.</p>
