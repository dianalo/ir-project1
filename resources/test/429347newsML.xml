<p>European Commission President Jacques Santer said on Sunday the French government could have intervened to prevent car-maker Renault from suddenly closing a big Belgian plant and laying off 3,100 workers.</p>
<p>Santer told France-2 television in an interview that the way Renault announced its decision had dealt a serious blow to the spirit of European unity.</p>
<p>The centre-right government, main shareholder in Renault, "could definitely have intervened" through its representatives on the management board.</p>
<p>"The spirit of confidence which is the very basis of European construction, which aims to be not only a market but also a market based on a certain solidarity and on social cohesion, has definitely suffered a serious blow," Santer said.</p>
<p>"It is not within the spirit of European directives to not inform or consult workers to try and reach an agreement, even if it on accompanying measures," Santer added.</p>
<p>Renault car workers staged brief strikes in several countries on Friday as the fallout over plans to close the Vilvoorde plant with the loss of 3,100 jobs spread.</p>
