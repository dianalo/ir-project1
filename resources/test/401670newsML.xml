<p>The Pakistani rupee closed steady at 41.20 to the dollar in the kerb market on Tuesday but may fall in the next few sessions on renewed demand for the U.S. currency, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the dollar might soon go short as a lot of investors could put dollars in the government's debt retirement scheme offering attractive returns.</p>
<p>The State (central) Bank of Pakistan rate was unchanged at 40.1200/40.3206 to the dollar set on October 22. The premium on foreign exchange bearer certificates closed at 3.0 percent compared to Monday's 3.10 percent. - Ovais Subhani 9221-5685192</p>
