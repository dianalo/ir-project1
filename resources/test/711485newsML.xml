<p>The European Union (EU) said on Monday Italy was on track to qualify for the single currency in 1999 as long as Italy promised to keep taking necessary steps to make the grade.</p>
<p>At a meeting of EU finance ministers, held against a backdrop of continuing differences over economic and monetary union (EMU), some also worried aloud that France's difficulties in meeting EMU criteria could damage the project.</p>
<p>Presenting its economic convergence programme to a gathering of the bloc's 15 finance ministers, Rome was praised for its efforts to restrain spending but was urged to take more savings measures if necessary.</p>
<p>"There was encouragement on the one hand but also an invitation to be very tough," a diplomat said.</p>
<p>Rome's hopes of joining the euro at the start on January 1, 1999 have been boosted by expectations EMU entry criteria would be eased to allow countries like France, seen as an essential participant, to qualify.</p>
<p>Germany, one of the vocal proponents of budgetary rigour, supported Italy's government.</p>
<p>"We are still in the middle of the year. Why shouldn't one have the chance to reach a successful conclusion," said German Finance Minister Theo Waigel when asked about Italy's ability to straighten out its finances this year.</p>
<p>Governments wanting to join EMU will be judged on their 1997 and 1998 economic and budget performances.</p>
<p>But for France, the question of whether the EU could allow a government that has acknowledged its 1997 deficit might be significantly higher than the Maastricht Treaty's three percent deficit-to-GDP target remained unresolved.</p>
<p>While Germany sought to paper over differences with France over interpretation of the euro's preconditions, others were less diplomatic.</p>
<p>"France is a problem. It shouldn't be that one is looking at 3.6 percent and also at 3.0 percent. This distorts competition," Austrian finance minister Rudolf Edlinger told Austrian reporters.</p>
<p>The ministers, determined to project a united front on the euro, also emphasised the need for greater economic policy coordination after EMU begins.</p>
<p>Europe's disturbingly high jobless rate was the focus at the opening of the first ministerial gathering under the Luxembourg EU presidency.</p>
<p>Led by France, which has put the jobs issue at the top of the agenda, there seemed to be broad acceptance that economic policy must be better coordinated after the euro is launched.</p>
<p>"We all know good economic policy is one that pays heed to all the elements of the policy mix," said French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, adding that France remained firmly committed to the euro.</p>
<p>"We are very much closer to the finishing line now. We simply need to persevere," he added.</p>
<p>France's uncertain budget outlook and emphasis on growth and jobs has created problems for Germany, which is under intense domestic pressure not to allow creation of a weak euro.</p>
<p>Bavarian premier Edmund Stoiber said in a newspaper interview on Monday a delay was preferable to a weak one.</p>
<p>One of the main EMU worries in the aftermath of the new French government's electoral victory is a split between Bonn and Paris over how economic policy should be managed under EMU.</p>
<p>France has offered a series of proposals aimed to redress the balance of power away from a European Central Bank and more towards national governments.</p>
<p>Worried that too much importance has been attached to a German model of monetary stability, the French government has managed to shift the debate towards economic growth and jobs.</p>
<p>But Germany's key concern is avoiding a scenario that politicises the policy decisions of an independent central bank.</p>
