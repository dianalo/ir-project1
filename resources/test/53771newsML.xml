<p>An ambitious bill to reserve one in every three seats in India's parliament and state assemblies for women faced glitches on Friday, hours before anticipated approval of the legislation by the lower house.</p>
<p>Some members said the government had turned hesitant on the revolutionary bill, which, if passed, could bring a radical change in the world's largest democracy. India has an estimated population of 930 million people, 48 percent of them women.</p>
<p>Within hours of the end of the budget session of the lower house, or Lok Sabha, opposition members said there appeared to be covert attempts by the government to stall the bill by raising questions on details linked to Hindu castes and regions.</p>
<p>Parliament is not expected to reconvene for another two months after Friday.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda on Wednesday introduced a constitutional amendment in the house to introduce the quota, which would only apply to the lower house in the federal parliament and the lower house in state legislative assembles.</p>
<p>Currently there are 39 women in the 545-member lower house.</p>
<p>"Small objections are being raised on a historic occasion," Sushma Swaraj, a member of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), told the house. She is among a handful of vocal women members from various parties championing the bill.</p>
<p>Parliament officials said consideration of the bill was put off until 6.30 p.m. (1300 gmt) on Friday after members sought time to discuss the legislation. Major parties, however, have expressed support for the bill, lawmakers said.</p>
<p>Some analysts say that men would continue to dominate parliament even if the bill was passed.</p>
<p>To change the constitution, the bill must be passed by both the lower and upper houses of the federal parliament with a two-thirds majority and then ratified by at least two-thirds of the assemblies in India's 26 states.</p>
<p>"The government is developing cold feet," Swaraj told reporters after a closed-door meeting her caucus had with Lok Sabha speaker Purno Sangma. "Now they are trying to fire from the shoulders of every member."</p>
<p>The bill says quotas should not adversely affect existing quotas for representatives from low castes in India, and should be rotated between various constituencies.</p>
<p>As many as 78 seats in the lower house are currently reserved for the lowest of castes or tribal people, in proportion to their 22.5 percent share in India's population.</p>
<p>Swaraj said some members raised questions on how India's smaller states that have just two seats could accommodate both quotas.</p>
<p>Others sought a quota within the women's quota for backward castes not currently eligible for parliament's caste quotas, she said.</p>
<p>"It is a ploy (to stall the law)," Swaraj said.</p>
<p>Shailaja (one name), a Congress party member, said she wanted to know at the meeting how the government would ensure a quota for the lowest of castes, to which she belongs, while ensuring the benefits of the proposed quota for women in her state, which has only 10 parliamentary seats.</p>
<p>But this was not an objection to the bill, she said.</p>
<p>"They (government officials) will conveniently say women had a difference of opinion between themselves," Congress party member Sukhbans Kaur said.</p>
