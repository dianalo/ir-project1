<p>Fugitive Cypriot businessman Asil Nadir will shortly begin a legal process aimed at paving the way for his return to Britain, his lawyer said on Monday.</p>
<p>"I think he will shortly instruct me on his abuse of process application," Peter Krivinskas told Reuters, adding that Nadir would not come back before a decision on this was given. Nadir, who skipped bail in 1993, faces charges connecting to his collapsed Polly Peck empire.  </p>
<p>Krivinskas was speaking after Nadir's former financial advisor, Elizabeth Forsyth, had her conviction on two offences of handling stolen goods overturned by a London appeal court.</p>
<p>Forsyth, 60, spent 10 months in jail after she was found guilty of dishonestly handling 400,000 pounds ($640,000) in April last year. Her sentence of five-years in jail was quashed in January.</p>
<p>The outcome of Forsyth's case was widely viewed as an indicator of whether Nadir would would press ahead with attempts to have theft and false accounting charges against him dropped.</p>
<p>Polly Peck, Nadir's fruit-to-electronics empire, collapsed in 1990 under a mountain of debt. Forsyth said she could not say if Nadir would return to Britain but in a statement she encouraged others who had fled from British justice "to return to face trial or judicial inquiry to clear their name".
