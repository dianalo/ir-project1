<p>The units of Burswood Property Trust rose sharply on Wednesday after the Trust announced plans late on Tuesday to corporatise and raise up to A$123 million through an issue to Metroplex Bhd of Malaysia.</p>
<p>At 11.00 a.m (0100 GMT), Burswood units were 21 cents higher at A$1.52 on turnover of 4.14 million units.</p>
<p>Under the deal Burswood will take control of the Burswood hotel and casino in Perth after an agreement between Burswood Resort Management Ltd (BRML) and Victoria Co Ltd of Japan, the owner of the hotel, and Metroplex.  </p>
<p>Burswood said on Tuesday that the West Australian government had approved the transaction which would see Burswood Resort Management Ltd (BRML) and Victoria Co relinquish their casino operation management agreement for A$89.5 million and for Burswood to purchase the hotel for A$97 million.</p>
