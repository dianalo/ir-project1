<headline>NY precious metals end mixed, gold support holding.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-18</dateline>

<p>COMEX and NYMEX precious metals futures ended little changed Friday on low volumes, with gold prices still recovering from a test of the year's lows on Tuesday, and the platinum group metals (PGM's) still awaiting news on Russia's export intentions.</p>
<p>"Gold prices look like they may have put in a double bottom, after support held on this week's test of January's lows and a close back over $350.00 would make the outlook very interesting," said Andre Dimino, CTA and fund manager with Apostle Capital Management in New Jersey.  </p>
<p>COMEX June gold closed down 90 cents at $343.40 an ounce, after trading a $343.00-345.20 range, inside Thursday's session range, after recovering from Wednesday's life-of-contract low at $339.50.</p>
<p>Estimated COMEX gold volume was a low 12,000 lots.</p>
<p>Open interest in COMEX gold was down 1,308 lots at 163,784 contracts Thursday, suggesting funds did some covering of recently established short positions, analysts said.</p>
<p>In the bullion market, spot gold ended quoted $341.10/60 compared to the London Friday afternoon fix at $342.10 and the New York close Thursday around $342.30/80.</p>
<p>But activity was light and the Jewish Passover holiday next week and the Islamic holiday of Id in the Middle East was slowing activity, traders said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week gold prices slumped to around $337.50 an ounce, testing the four year lows seen in January this year around $336.00, but support held suggesting a significant bottom may be close to forming, analysts said.</p>
<p>In overnight news, Russian Finance Minister Chubais announced the deregulation of the Russian gold market.</p>
<p>Currently the Russian government maintains tight control over the production and marketing of precious metals.</p>
<p>The Russian government announced earlier this year that gold output fell six percent to 3.7 million ounces in 1996.</p>
<p>The figure of 3.7 million ounces reflected the amout of gold officially reported to the government by producers and banks, CPM Group analyst Jeffrey Christian said.</p>
<p>Additionally, Russia's central bank earlier said it plans to increase it's gold stocks about 25 percent in 1997 and 1998, presumably by buying gold stocks from the Ministry of Finance, Christian noted.</p>
<p>But the head of the precious metals division of Russia's central bank, Sergei Kyshtymov, denied Friday a report on Thursday which said Russia was in talks with Switzerland's UBS to replace about 30 tonnes of gold, held as colleratal for a loan, with platinum group metals.</p>
<p>The spot gold/silver ratio ended little changed at 72.4, after slipping from a two month high at 73.5 on April 4.</p>
<p>COMEX May silver ended up 1.8 cents at $4.713 an ounce after trading a $4.670-4.755 range, with support in the bullion market now seen around the year's lows around $4.650.</p>
<p>NYMEX July platinum ended down $1.20 an ounce at $377.20, after seeing its highest levels in a month Thursday, while NYMEX June palladium ended up $1.10 at $154.60.</p>
<p>The October NYMEX platinum/COMEX gold spread slipped to $28.40 from a four week high around $30.00 Thursday.</p>
<p>"But it's only the paper market which is lower on fund profit taking," one trade house source said.</p>
<p>"The physical PGM market in Zurich and the forward market remains very tight with lease rates very high."</p>
<p>Lease rates for both platinum and palladium jumped this week as some trade houses were forced to borrow to cover forward sales, with world PGM supplies very tight due to the disruption to Russian exports since December.</p>
<p>Russian officials Friday were still unaware of any plans for a talks next week on a resumption of PGM exports to Japan, after Chubais on said Thursday the talks would go ahead.</p>
