<p>The Indian government on Thursday said it had approved plans of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd (IPCL) to raise $175 million through issue of foreign currency convertible bonds.  </p>
<p>"The company will take a decision about the pricing and timing of the new foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) in consultation with the lead managers," a government statement said.</p>
<p>The state-controlled IPCL is setting up a grassroot petrochemical company in the western state of Gujarat and expanding its gas cracker unit in Baroda.</p>
<p>"The government, even after the issue of these FCCBs by IPCL, would continue to be the majority shareholder," the statement said.</p>
