<p>Japan will decide next week if new steps are needed to keep its economic recovery on track after studying growth data to be released later on Friday, Finance Minister Wataru Kubo said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has said that judging the state of the economy -- as well as diffusing Tokyo's dispute with Okinawa over the concentration of U.S. military bases on the southern Japan island -- are key to his decision on whether to call snap general elections.</p>
<p>Economists expect the gross domestic product (GDP) figures being released on Friday afternoon to show that the economy shrank somewhat in the April-June quarter after showing stunningly strong growth in the first three months of the year.</p>
<p>Private economists polled by Reuters estimated an average fall of 1.1 percent in the April-June period from the previous quarter, with forecast falls ranging from 0.3 to 1.8 percent.</p>
<p>Figures in that range, they said, would not be weak enough to alter the view that the economy is recovering gradually.</p>
<p>Japan's GDP -- output of goods and services minus net income from overseas output -- grew a surprising three percent in the first three months of the year from the previous quarter, or an annualised 12.7 percent. But many economists expect a slowdown later in the year.</p>
<p>With election fever in the air, many politicians are keen to push for an extra budget for the fiscal year to March 31, 1997, to woo voters worried about the recovery and accustomed to a dose of public spending ahead of national polls.</p>
<p>Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is already in the unhappy position of having to defend an unpopular rise in a consumption tax to five percent from three percent next April.</p>
<p>"Lots of people in the governing party side think that the economic recovery hasn't got real energy yet, so we should at least announce that we should have a supplementary budget with some public investment in it," LDP Secretary-General Koichi Kato said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The prime minister is keeping the public guessing over the timing of a Lower House election -- which need not be held until next July -- partly because his coalition partners are not keen to go to the polls.</p>
<p>But Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota is expected to accede as early as Friday to Tokyo's request that he force the renewal of leases for private land used by U.S. bases on Okinawa, diffusing a dispute which has bedevilled Hashimoto since he took office in January and clearing the way for an early poll.</p>
<p>Economists say that any ploy by politicians to promise a hefty extra budget or freeze the consumption tax would worry not only Finance Ministry mandarins concerned with Japan's huge budget deficit, but financial markets as well.</p>
<p>"Promises that will be made will come back to bite both the economy and the politicians," said Russell Jones, chief economist at Lehman Brothers. "The direction of domestic fiscal policy should be towards consolidation, not expansion."</p>
<p>Japan enjoyed budget surpluses until 1992, but the balance has plunged into the red as a five-year slump forced the issuance of government bonds to finance stimulative packages.</p>
<p>Many business executives, worried about the deficit and cautiously optimistic that the economy will not slip backwards, are opposed to hefty public works spending this time around.</p>
<p>Politicians also appear to be waking up to the problem.</p>
<p>Financial daily Nihon Keizai Shimbun said on Friday that a growing number of politicians in the LDP especially were backing the notion of drafting new laws to cut the deficit as a way to win votes in the election.</p>
