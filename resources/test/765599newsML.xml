<p>Jose Maria Olazabal will play his most intense schedule since returning to golf in a bid to ease the selection dilemma facing his friend and European Ryder Cup captain Severiano Ballesteros.</p>
<p>Until a three-week run prior to the British Open, Olazabal had not played more than two events in succession as he rehabilitates from his 18-month lay-off with foot problems.</p>
<p>Now Olazabal, who currently holds the 10th and last automatic Ryder Cup place, will trust his recovering feet to hold out for four events in five weeks to try to build up enough points to guarantee an automatic place. That would enable Ballesteros to pick U.S.-based players Nick Faldo and Jesper Parnevik.</p>
<p>"It is not taking too much of a chance playing four events because my feet are much better now and I can concentrate more on getting my driving in shape," said Olazabal on the eve of the Scandinavian Masters.</p>
<p>He will play the Swedish event, take a week off and then play the U.S. PGA championship, which counts for European Cup points, the European Open and the BMW International.</p>
<p>"I'm hoping I can ease Seve's wild-card problem but for my own ends. It will be nice to get into the team and my goal now is to do things right on the course so I can be in the team by right," said Olazabal.</p>
<p>"I don't know whether Seve would pick me anyway or whether he is thinking about Faldo and Parnevik. I don't want to interfere because that is solely his decision. But Parnevik is playing well and Faldo is experienced."</p>
<p>Eleventh-place Padraig Harrington is Olazabal's closest rival playing this week's event, which starts on Thursday. But the Spaniard is aware that several players are a threat.</p>
<p>"Any one of the top 20 can make it with one good week," he said</p>
<p>Parnevik, who is no longer a European Tour member and can play only with a wild card, is also in the Scandinavian field, along with Colin Montgomerie whose goal is to improve his order of merit third place as he looks for a record fifth European number one honour.</p>
<p>"I hope Jesper makes the team because he's certainly one of the best 12 players in Europe," said Montgomerie.</p>
