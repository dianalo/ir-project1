<p>Russian and Azeri officials agreed on Tuesday to improve trade and economic ties after disruption on their border caused by Russia's Chechen war and said they were confident Azeri oil would start flowing through Chechnya soon.</p>
<p>Valery Chernyayev, head of the Russian pipeline company Transneft, told reporters in Baku that the pipeline through Chechnya was "practically ready" and a trial batch of Azeri oil would be sent to Russia shortly.</p>
<p>But in Moscow the head of the oil company run by Chechnya's separatist leadership criticised Russia's energy ministry for dragging its feet in oil negotiations, which are among the most important for the peace process in the region.</p>
<p>Russia is keen for a share of revenues from transporting oil from Azerbaijan's Caspian offshore fields to the Black Sea. The pipeline, damaged in the fighting, runs through Chechnya.</p>
<p>A consortium including Western oil companies is planning to exploit massive Caspian reserves, pumping oil along two routes, one through Russia, including Chechnya, and one through Georgia.</p>
<p>Russian Deputy Prime Minister Valery Serov told reporters in Baku after talks with Azeri officials: "We guarantee the safety of the pipeline." Under their peace deal with Moscow, the Chechen separatist forces will guard the pipeline on their land.</p>
<p>Natig Aliyev, president of the Azeri state oil company Socar, said Chechnya would not pose a problem for the transport of Caspian oil now that the war was over.</p>
<p>But Khozhakhmed Yarikhanov, president of Yuzhnaya Neftyanaya Kompaniya (Southern Oil Company), told Itar-Tass news agency the Russian Fuel and Energy Ministry had "grossly violated one of the most important points" of the peace agreement signed by the Russian government and separatist leadership last November.</p>
<p>Under the deal, which Moscow hopes will help stave off Chechen demands for full independence by developing economic ties, Yarikhanov said the ministry should have concluded a firm agreement on the extraction, refining and transport of oil in and through Chechnya by December 1.</p>
<p>He said its failure to do this could only be "an attempt to put pressure on Chechnya".</p>
<p>Officials at the Fuel and Energy Ministry were not immediately available for comment on Tuesday, which is a public holiday in Russia.</p>
<p>RIA news agency, in a report from Baku, quoted Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Pyotr Rodionov as saying "we see several problems differently" but adding that there should be a mutually profitable partnership among Russians, Azeris and Chechens.</p>
<p>Rodionov's deputy, Anatoly Shatalov, told Interfax news agency that there would be no problems with transporting oil through Chechnya once the region had held elections for a new president on January 27.</p>
