<p>Shares in UK supermarket group Tesco Plc cut earlier gains on Monday after the group reported like-for-like sales growth of 7.5 percent for the five weeks covering the Christmas and New Year period.</p>
<p>The shares were up 1p at 368p by 1119 GMT after earlier hitting a record 373p.  </p>
<p>Tesco said in a trading statement that for the 21 week period to January 5 1997 total UK sales growth was 13.1 percent with like-for-like sales up 8.1 percent.</p>
<p>Total sales growth over the five week Christmas period was 12.2 percent. "Sales were very good, at the top end of expectations," said Bill Myers, food retail analyst at Williams de Broe. "There's no problem with these figures at all," he added.</p>
<p>Rival supermarket group J Sainsbury is expected to release its trading statement on Friday. The shares were down 7-1/2p at 389p ahead of the news.  </p>
<p>"At first glance the market will obviously think that if Tesco is doing well then they must be hurting somebody and that somebody is Sainsbury," Myers said.</p>
<p>"I think Sainsbury's figures will also be OK, but not as good as Tesco's," he added.</p>
