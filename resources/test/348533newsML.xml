<p>MIM Holdings Ltd chief executive Nick Stump said on Friday the Australia-based resources company should emerge from the current half year in better shape.</p>
<p>"We're in a stronger position for the second half," Stump told a press conference.</p>
<p>He said the first half (July-December) operating loss of $A400,000 announced earlier on Friday was not unexpected "given the copper fiasco of last year."</p>
<p>"We've got to look beyond that and we've come out in the second half in a much stronger shape," he said.  </p>
<p>The reduction in MIM's half-year dividend to 1.25 Australian cents a share from 2.5 cents a year ago, was related to the "uncertainty in copper," Stump said.</p>
<p>MIM produces a range of base metals, most notably copper.</p>
<p>The company is expanding its Mount Isa copper mine and is developing two additional mines, Ernest Henry, also in Queensland, and Alumbrera in Argentina.</p>
<p>It also is increasing copper smelting capacity at Mount Isa to 250,000 tonnes a year from the current 175,000 tonnes.  </p>
<p>MIM has said that every one cent move in the copper price over a year means A$3.77 million to the bottom line for the company.</p>
