<headline>FEATURE - British parties fight for centre in economic policy.</headline>

<p>Their economic slogans have become virtually interchangeable and their target audience is the same -- the moderate centre ground of British politics.</p>
<p>The ruling Conservatives and the opposition Labour party insist they offer fundamentally different visions of the country's economic future as they prepare for a general election no more than eight months away.</p>
<p>But voters may be hard pressed to tell the difference.</p>
<p>Both parties promise prudent management of the economy, a lower tax burden, steady growth and low inflation. They pledge to help businesses make profits and create jobs with minimal interference from the state.</p>
<p>Reminders that the two parties were once poles apart ideologically are now to be found mainly in the nuances.</p>
<p>The word "fairness" crops up rather more often in Labour party rhetoric, while the Conservatives talk more about "choice" and the need to roll back the state.</p>
<p>Last week, Prime Minister John Major derided what he called "the fashionable thought that there is no difference between the parties."</p>
<p>"Some of the lunatic ideas that the Labour Party have had have gone," he told a radio interviewer. "But some of the ideas they have at the moment are immensely dangerous because they're just plain wrong."</p>
<p>Major portrayed Conservative plans to curb the role of the state as a moral crusade, saying: "There is a moral case for smaller government and therefore less tax."</p>
<p>This drew a scornful response from deputy Labour leader John Prescott, who said he was happy to let morality be the electoral battleground, but added:</p>
<p>"We will give a voice to those suffering from record unemployment, homelessness and poverty and ask them what they think of John Major's money morality."</p>
<p>Away from the rough-and-tumble of daily politics, the broad outlines of the platforms on which the election will be fought have become clear.</p>
<p>The Conservatives will claim credit for economic recovery, which has come to fruition just in time to give them at least a hope that their dismal opinion poll ratings may pick up, while accusing Labour of planning to raise taxes and public spending.</p>
<p>Labour will promise to do more to help the poor and reduce unemployment, spend more on education and training and run the welfare state more efficiently -- all while maintaining a tight grip on state finances.</p>
<p>"The driving force in this election will be the economy," says Ciaran Barr, an economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>"A buoyant economy always benefits the party that is in office. The Tories will try to exploit Labour's perceived weakness on taxes, even though they have put them up by a whopping amount since 1992."</p>
<p>The Conservatives have pledged to reduce the standard rate of income tax to 20 percent from the present 24 percent when this is affordable and to reduce the amount of national income spent by the state to 40 percent and, eventually, even less.</p>
<p>But they appear to lack any new "big ideas" and prefer to trumpet what they hail as their transformation of the British economy during their 17 years in office, with privatisation, deregulation and choice being the buzzwords.</p>
<p>"The British experiment has succeeded," proclaimed Chancellor of the Exchequer (finance minister) Kenneth Clarke.</p>
<p>"We have taken firm control of the public sector and contained the growth of government. We have taken the market to areas no-one believed it could reach. We have redefined the role of the state. There has been a genuine cultural revolution."</p>
<p>A revolution of comparable importance has taken place in the thinking of the Labour leadership since Tony Blair took the helm two years ago.</p>
<p>Blair has effectively abandoned traditional socialism and no longer sees Labour as the party mainly of the working class. He has publicly embraced the profit motive and appears to consort more with business leaders than trade unionists.</p>
<p>At one of countless meetings with industrialists this year, he said: "If we fail to provide the right environment for business, we will not succeed as a government."</p>
<p>Beyond committing itself to a minimum wage and to the European Union's Social Chapter on workers' rights, Labour has been coy about what exactly its policies would be, especially in the key areas of tax and public spending.</p>
<p>It has no plans to renationalise enterprises such as the railways and telecommunications which were privatised by the Conservatives, but has pledged a one-off "windfall tax" on the profits of now-private utility companies.</p>
<p>Finance spokesman Gordon Brown favours a starting rate of income tax of 15 or even 10 percent to help the poor, but makes clear that this is a long-term commitment.</p>
<p>Blair says he has no plans to increase the top rate of income tax, which was cut to 40 percent by the Conservatives from 80 to 90 percent under 1970s Labour governments.</p>
<p>Labour leaders are believed to be sympathetic to a single European currency, but they have avoided any firm commitment to the project.</p>
<p>All the opinion polls suggest that Blair will be the next occupant of 10 Downing Street and his every word is subject to intense scrutiny by the media and the financial markets.</p>
<p>In an article in the Guardian newspaper last week, the Labour leader said his goal was "a modern civic society in which all individuals have the ability to develop their potential."</p>
<p>He said he still believed in socialism as a set of values based around notions of social justics, but added: "Socialism as a rigid form of economic determinism has ended, and rightly."</p>
