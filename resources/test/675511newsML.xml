<p>Japanese shares in London firmed in London amid some buying in some Japanese exporters and car maker Honda Corp.</p>
<p>The Nikkei/ISE 50 index was up 6.59 points, or 0.41 percent, at 1,603.41 by 1545 GMT.</p>
<p>Earlier in Tokyo the Nikkei average was weighed down 122.31 points or 0.60 percent to 20,385.54 as a broker scandal took its toll.</p>
<p>"Japan is looking at Denver (G7 summit June 20-22). So it was a cautious trading day", one trader said.</p>
<p>"There were some bigger blocks in Honda", he added, which had caused the stock to rebound as recent losses were considered overdone.</p>
<p>Honda was up at 3,285 yen, compared with a close of 3,210 yen in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Among others, Fujitsu was up 15 yen to 1565 yen in London, but down on its Tokyo close of 1,570 yen.</p>
<p>Canon was also actively traded, dealers said. The stock was up 22.50 yen to 3,065 yen, up from a close of 3,060 yen in Tokyo.</p>
