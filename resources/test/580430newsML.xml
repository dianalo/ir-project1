<p>Danish share prices closed at a record high on Tuesday, powered by a combination of Wall Street gains and independent advances by key Danish shares.</p>
<p>Dealers saw the ascent continuing.</p>
<p>"There is good sentiment and interest in the market, so I would not be surprised if it rise again on Wednesday," a trader said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index gained 1.92 point to 163.03, beating the March 11 record of 161.47. Overall bourse turnover was 1.12 billion crowns. The KFX June future rose 2.40 point to 163.25, with 794 contracts, each worth 100,000 crowns, traded.  </p>
<p>Banks once again were a driving force in the day's advance.</p>
<p>Unidanmark rose 10 crowns to 354.00 and BG Bank climbed 12 crowns to 317.00. Den Danske Bank at one point was 13 crowns up at 628.00, but profit-taking took the shine off and it closed up a single crown at 616.00.</p>
<p>Coloplast had a similar ride, closing five crowns up at 485.00 after earlier touching 501.00 after reporting better than forecast first quarter results.</p>
<p>Novo Nordisk rose 12 crowns to 684.00 ahead of its first quarter results on Wednesday. --Steve Weizman, Copenhagen newsroom +45 33 969650</p>
