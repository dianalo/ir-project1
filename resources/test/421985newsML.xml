<headline>INSTANT VIEW - German January industrial output.</headline>

<p>Following are economists' reactions to data showing German industrial output fell in January by 1.7 percent from December, with the fall in overall output caused by a dramatic 25 percent slump in construction activity. Year-on-year, January's output was up 1.7 percent.</p>
<p>ARMIN KAYSER, SBC WARBURG: "The figures were worse than expected but it looks as if the decline in construction contributed heavily towards the fall. If you exclude construction, manufacturing sector output grew. It shows that the economic recovery is on track. The export sector is developing very dynamically and capital equipment spending is showing first signs of life but the domestic economy is sluggish. Gross domestic product will probably show a small rise of 0.2 percent in the first quarter of 1997 and growth should pick up in the following quarters.  </p>
<p>LOTHAR HESSLER, TRINKAUS &amp; BURKHARDT: "Overall the figure was worse than expected but if you strip out construction you're left with a rise of 1.3 percent. We predict a rise of almost two percent in 1997 but that's merely a recovery from last year's 1.1 percent fall and is not a sign of a booming economy. The data signals a slight economic recovery overall and does not give the Bundesbank a reason to lower interest rates. We think that gross domestic product growth in 1997 will be about two percent, up from 1.4 percent last year.</p>
