<p>Mexican media company Grupo Televisa reported good second quarter results on Thursday due to healthy advertising revenues in its core television business.</p>
<p>But analysts were divided over the near-term future of the media giant, with some expressing doubt the company could cut costs and revamp programming fast enough to fend off hungry rival TV Azteca.</p>
<p>Televisa racked up second quarter profits of 4.895 billion pesos compared to a year-ago loss of 279.7 million pesos.  </p>
<p>Not including extraordinary gains from a restructuring at affiliate PanAmSat, the gain would have been 136.8 million. Many analysts had expected a slight quarterly loss without the one-time gains.</p>
<p>"You saw clear evidence this company is a lot about fixed costs. Revenues went up sharply and with a little bit of peso strength and fixed costs, margins improved and so did the bottom line," said Marla Marron at ING Barings in New York.</p>
<p>Quarterly revenues came in at 3.309 billion pesos, higher than a Reuters survey of three industry analysts whose average forecast was 3.134 billion pesos.  </p>
<p>Investors were clearly pleased, driving up the company's stock price by $1/01 to $29-7/8 on Thursday.</p>
<p>Higher advertising came for the political campaign for the July 6 mid-term elections, financial companies competing in the new private pension fund system and rival telephone firms battling in the newly opened long-distance market, the company said.</p>
<p>However, some analysts warned of slower ad growth in upcoming quarters.  </p>
<p>"The elections were a one-time thing, and pension fund and telecommunications companies may not keep up their pace of advertising. So what happens down the road?" one Mexico City analyst, who declined to be named, said.</p>
<p>The area of biggest disagreement among analysts was costs.</p>
<p>Televisa's cost of sales rose 15.2 percent versus the year-ago quarter and selling expenses increased 3.1 percent. Administrative expenses decreased, however, 5.7 percent.  </p>
<p>Most analysts said it was inevitable that the company's costs would rise as it revamped programming and modernized its news division to compete with Azteca, which has in past years stolen market share from Televisa.</p>
<p>"You would expect their cost of sales to go up. They are trying to improve the quality of their programming and expand it for the DTH (satellite TV) venture," Marron said.</p>
<p>And Televisa's year 2000 cost-cutting plan -- which calls for $90 million a year in lowering fixed costs -- will probably kick in later this year and next, analysts said.</p>
<p>"They've just initiated the program so you will not see it right away in expenses...but there should be a decrease in fixed costs by the second half and a big benefit next year," said Niraj Gupta, an analyst at Schroder Wertheim in New York.</p>
<p>But the Mexico City analyst said he was not convinced Televisa can both cut costs and hold Azteca at bay.</p>
<p>"It all comes down to whether or not you believe them," he said. "My attitude now is 'show me the money.'"</p>
