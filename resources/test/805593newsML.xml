<p>China's stock markets ended mixed on Monday with trading in Shenzhen's hard currency B shares halted due to a holiday in Hong Kong, brokers said.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign currency B shares rose slightly on Monday after a late spurt of buying lifted the index out of negative territory, brokers said.</p>
<p>But the Hong Kong holiday limited both foreign and Hong Kong demand, which had helped push Shanghai B shares sharply higher on Thursday and Friday, they said.</p>
<p>The B index closed up 0.748 point or 0.85 percent to 88.424 points on turnover of $30.0 million compared with $65.159 million on Friday.</p>
<p>Domestic investors bought B shares in late afternoon trading after the index touched a low of 84.673 points, brokers said. Some foreign institutions also picked up quality B shares towards the closing bell, they said.</p>
<p>"There was a public holiday in Hong Kong so foreign buying was light," said a trader at a foreign bank in Shanghai. "After Hong Kong opens again on Tuesday it should be better."</p>
<p>All 47 of Shanghai's B share issues were traded on Monday with 22 gaining ground and 20 falling back. Five were unchanged.</p>
<p>Shanghai Shangling Electric Appliances Co was the top B share gainer on bargain-hunting after early losses, surging $0.024 or 9.45 percent to $0.278.</p>
<p>Heilongjiang Electric Power Co was the most actively traded B share on institutional buying, rising $0.090 or 9.02 percent to $1.088 on volume of around 4.6 million shares.</p>
<p>Shanghai's domestic currency A shares fell slightly on Monday due to weak sentiment, but the rise in the B index helped drag the A share market off the lows, brokers said.</p>
<p>The A index ended down 9.382 points or 0.79 percent to 1,179.442 points on turnover of 2.750 billion yuan against 3.287 billion on Friday.</p>
<p>The SSE30 blue chip index slid 23.722 points or 0.66 percent to 3,556.188 points.</p>
<p>Shenzhen's domestic currency A share index closed lower Monday on steady losses after a string of disappointing first-half company results, analysts said.</p>
<p>The A share index tumbled 9.73 points, or 2.59 percent, to 365.47 on turnover of 3.3 billion yuan compared with Friday's 3.4 billion.</p>
<p>"The results are darkening the market's mood each day and we still have a lot of uncertainties ahead," said an analyst at China South Securities said.</p>
<p>Many of the 22 A share companies that released their first-half operating results over the weekend showed lower profits.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Shenbao Industrial Co Ltd, Weifu Fuel Injection Co Ltd and Shenzhen Properties &amp; Resources Development (Group) Ltd all reported a fall in first-half profits.</p>
<p>Shenbao's A shares tumbled their 10 percent limit, losing 0.83 yuan to 7.43 yuan to become one of the day's worst performers.</p>
<p>Shenzhen Properties also lost ground, shedding 0.38 yuan to 5.90 yuan. Weifu does not have A shares.</p>
