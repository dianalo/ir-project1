<p>Britain's chances of achieving sustained growth and low inflation are the best for 30 years, but interest rates will have to rise in 1997 to keep price pressures at bay, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.</p>
<p>"Cost pressures are expected to remain under control as average earnings growth remains modest, productivity growth remains healthy and monetary policy is firm," it said.</p>
<p>The OECD said British inflation could stabilise in the two to 2.5 percent range in 1997/98. Underlying annual inflation stripped of home loan costs stuck at 3.3 percent in November, well above the government's 2.5 percent target range.</p>
<p>"The OECD Secretariat projections assume a further small rise in base rates in the second half of 1997 to lock in low inflation levels," the report said.</p>
<p>"Such action would be a prudent response to above trend economic growth projected in the coming two years."</p>
<p>The OECD's year-end economic outlook, reviewing growth in its 27 member countries, was due to be published on December 19 but the organisation allowed the early release of the report after an international magazine broke the embargo.</p>
<p>The OECD said its inflation projections were subject to uncertainty concerning the level of the output gap -- which it estimated at around 1/2 percent of GDP in 1998 -- and structural unemployment.</p>
<p>The OECD forecast GDP growth of 3.3 percent in 1997 and 3.0 percent in 1998 -- well up from the 2.4 percent it predicts for 1996 -- but said sterling's appreciation could have a dampening effect.</p>
<p>The pickup in overall growth would initially reflect the end of stock liquidation, it said.</p>
<p>"But looking further ahead, private spending should be sustained by buoyant disposable incomess, recent tax cuts, low interest rates and other windfall receipts'," the OECD said.</p>
<p>The OECD said the risks surrounding its projections appeared balanced.</p>
<p>"On the upside, strong growth in the monetary aggregates could feed into stronger consumer spending and private investment. On the downside, a weaker than predicted recovery in continental Europe could spill over into lower exports and business confidence."</p>
<p>The OECD said that as private investment gathered pace and the government's borrowing requirement remained significant, a deterioration in the balance of savings to investment was possible.</p>
<p>It said low wage growth and falling unemployment were "the most tangible signs of the positive benefits of past and oongoing micro-economic reforms and a stable macro-economic policy framework."</p>
<p>Unemployment, which was 7.2 percent in October, could drop to below seven percent in 1998, the lowest level in eight years, while remaining above the structural rate.</p>
<p>The OECD said fiscal consolidation had been proceeding less rapidly than planned because of sluggish growth and weaker than expected tax revenues.</p>
<p>"But significant further progress in delivering the planned reduction in public sector borrowing will be needed to achieve the government's medium-term balanced budget objective."</p>
<p>It projected general government net borrowing at around 3.7 percent of GDP in 1997 and 3.0 percent -- the Maastricht Treaty's reference value -- in 1998.</p>
<p>Gross debt is expected to stabilise in 1997/98 at slightly above the 60 percent Maastricht target for European economic and monetary union.</p>
