<p>Industrial conglomerate Norsk Hydro ASA is expected to post a nine-month result before tax of about 8,825 million crowns, according to eight analysts polled by Reuters.</p>
<p>The comparative figure for last year was 9,023 million for Norway's largest listed company.</p>
<p>For the third quarter alone, analysts expected a pre-tax result of 2,684 million crowns, up from 2,659 million in the third quarter of 1995.</p>
<p>Hydro said on September 30 it expected earnings in the second half of the year to be hit by a recent downturn in aluminium prices.</p>
<p>It added that production problems at the North Sea Lille-Frigg gas condensate field meant it might not be able to fully recover its investment of 470 million crowns in the development.</p>
<p>Analysts were unsure what Hydro will do with the Lille-Frigg development. Some figured the company would make a complete or partial writedown in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Without a possible Lille-Frigg writedown in the third quarter, pre-tax profits of 8,943 million crowns were projected for the first nine months.</p>
<p>Six analysts said buy Hydro shares and two said hold.</p>
<p>Hydro will present the result on October 21.</p>
