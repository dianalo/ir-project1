<p>World production of oilseed meals in the 1996/97 (October/September) season, at 166.81 million tonnes, should be above the 166.07 million tonnes seen in 1995/96 but below earlier expectations, the Oil World newsletter said.</p>
<p>The independent publication cited smaller carry-in stocks of oilseed and cuts in production forecasts for cottonseed and rapeseed.</p>
<p>But Asian net meal import demand was set to rise sharply to 5.4 million tonnes in 1996/97 after 4.4 million in 1995/96.</p>
<p>Oil World, which based this forecast on 10 Far Eastern countries, including China, cited an expansion in livestock industries in the region.</p>
<p>China alone should import 2.5 million tonnes of soymeal in 1996/97 after an estimated 1.6 million in the 1995/96 season.</p>
<p>U.S. soymeal demand was seen stagnant at 24.25 million tonnes in 1996/97.</p>
<p>But oilmeal consumption in the EU-15 would fall to 44.75 million tonnes after 45.76 million in 1995/96 because of favourable feed grain prices amid high crops and stocks.</p>
<p>EU soymeal consumption was pegged at 21.65 million tonnes in 1996/97 (22.40 million in 1995/96).</p>
