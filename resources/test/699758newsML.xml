<p>Rothschild Continuation Holdings AG, parent of merchant banking group NM Rothschild, on Tuesday confirmed it had created a partnership drawing together its main UK, Australian, Hong Kong and Singapore companies.</p>
<p>Called NM Rothschild &amp; Sons Partnership, the structure is divided into three business divisions which will be managed and co-ordinated globally with the aim of serving clients who operate around the world.</p>
<p>The three divisions are -- treasury and bullion trading, resource banking and investment banking.</p>
<p>"The new structure not only aggregates a substantial amount of the group's capital for the benefit of clients, but also allows Rothschilds to manage its own resources more efficiently and therefore more competitively," Sir Evelyn de Rothschild, chairman of the group, said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Successful banks are those able to leverage client relationships across different products and regions. The global partnership arrangement should allow our main merchant banking businesses to do just that," he added.</p>
