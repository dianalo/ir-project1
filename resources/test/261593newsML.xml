<p>A Florida health worker accused of making public a confidential list of AIDS patients could face criminal charges even though he resigned and was not fired, a state official said Tuesday.</p>
<p>William Calvert, who collected information about new AIDS cases as part of a national effort to track the spread of the deadly virus, became involved in the nation's largest security breach of confidential AIDS information last September.</p>
<p>A list of people with AIDS and HIV, believed to have been downloaded from Calvert's computer, was mailed to two Florida newspapers. An accompanying letter blamed the leak on Calvert.</p>
<p>The Florida Department of Law Enforcement began a criminal investigation shortly after the leak.</p>
<p>The department expected to soon refer its findings to prosecutors for possible charges, a spokeswoman for the FDLE said.</p>
<p>Calvert, who denied making the list public and contended it was stolen from his computer, cooperated with investigators, his attorney, George Hayes, said.</p>
<p>The state's public health department fired Calvert in October for violating security procedures. Calvert was ready to contest that firing in a public hearing set to begin Tuesday, but instead reached a settlement with the state.</p>
<p>Calvert will get about $8,500 in back pay and be allowed to resign, according to the settlement, details of which were released Monday. Prospective employers seeking background on him will not see the strongly worded letter of termination from the state unless they make a public records request.</p>
<p>Both sides said the settlement was designed primarily to halt a lengthy and expensive hearing with as many as 50 witnesses, some of whom were expected to testify that Calvert used the AIDS database to screen his dates.</p>
<p>"It was evident he was never, ever going to be able to return to his job," Hayes said. "There has been too much attention by the media and too much animosity with his superiors."</p>
