<p>Toyota Motor Co said on Wednesday that it has developed a highly advanced hybrid power system for use in mass-produced passenger cars and will launch sales of passenger cars using the system later this year.</p>
<p>Under the new system, called the Toyota Hybrid System, a gasoline engine, electric motor and electric generator are used to achieve nearly twice the fuel efficiency of conventional gasoline engine cars and drastically reduce exhaust emissions.</p>
<p>The new system came after Toyota succeeded in developing environment-friendly, low fuel consumption engines such as a lean-burn engine in 1984 and a direct injection gasoline engine in 1996, the nation's biggest carmaker said in a statement.</p>
<p>An improved-efficiency gasoline engine provides the main power to drive the wheels, as in conventional automobiles.</p>
<p>Drive power can also be supplied by an electric motor, which derives its electricity from the nickel-metal hydride battery and an electric generator, it said.</p>
