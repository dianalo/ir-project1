<p>NYCE cotton futures ended higher on a light local short-covering rally on the close in an otherwise dull trading day.</p>
<p>With the exception of the last minute blip the market had a barely discernable range, with most of the market focused on the weather for the coming weekend.</p>
<p>The active December contract finished at 74.66 cents a lb, up 0.10 cents from Thursday, trading between 74.35 cents and 74.60 a pound.</p>
<p>"I had most of my people in the OJ pit," said one commission house trader, speaking of the orange juice market, which went limit down early Friday. "Cotton was a dawdle."</p>
<p>"We saw a couple of locals on the doing some buying on the close," another trader said. "There was some light trade buying as well."</p>
<p>There was little fundamental news to sway the market one way or the other. "We're waiting on the weather," the commission house broker said. "If it's perfect weather, cotton prices will fall."</p>
<p>Weather Services is forcasting scattered showers in the Delta region over the weekend. No damaging cold is expected in Brazil over the weekend.</p>
<p>Technical resistance was pegged at 75.00 cents a lb, while support was seen at Friday's low of 74.35 cents a lb.</p>
