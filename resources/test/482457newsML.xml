<p>	  vote of confidence on April 11</p>
<p>Bombay share prices overcame lethargy to rise sharply in late afternoon trade on Wednesday as market players drew solace from hopes the tax-cutting budget will not be marred by the political crisis, brokers said.</p>
<p>"The market is drawing support from expectations the budget will be untouched by political manoeuvrings," said a trader.</p>
<p>"There's a precedent that even after the resignation of the government, the budget has been taken up," P.A. Sangma, speaker of Lok Sabha, or lower house of parliament, told reporters in New Delhi.</p>
<p>The crippled government of prime minister H.D.Deve Gowda has to face a trust vote in parliament on April 11 after the Congress party withdrew its crucial support, plunging the country into a political crisis and putting the budget in jeopardy.</p>
<p>At 0955 GMT, the BSE index was up 113.59 points, or 3.31 percent, at 3,540.60.</p>
