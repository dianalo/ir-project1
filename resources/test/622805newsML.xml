<p>Russian Pavel Tonkov's lead in the Giro d'Italia cycling race survived a squall of attacks in Thursday's mountainous stage where risks came at every hairpin bend.</p>
<p>The Russian's key team-worker Giuseppe di Grande from Sicily won the 214-km leg from La Spezia, and later admitted that he too had taken a chance in going for victory.</p>
<p>"It was a risk to leave Pavel in the last three kilometres, especially if he had had trouble, but it worked out," said di Grande.</p>
<p>"It would have been dangerous if there had been more than three kilometres to go," said Tonkov.</p>
<p>"There had been a lot of attacks but they were doing it to show that they are still strong."</p>
<p>The Sicilian held off Spain's Marcos Serrano and third-placed Alexandre Shefer from Kazakhstan as five riders contested the sprint at this Ligurian resort.</p>
<p>Tonkov arrived 12 seconds later with his chief rivals France's Luc Leblanc and Italian Ivan Gotti, so the top three overall remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Tonkov, who took over the leader's jersey on the third day in San Marino, still leads Leblanc by 41 seconds with Gotti one minute seven seconds in arrears.</p>
<p>Tonkov was unshaken by constant attacks from Leblanc, Gotti and others as the head of the race toiled over the 1061-metre Passo del Faiallo and the 1287-metre Monte Beigua, spread-eagling 150 riders as far as 25 minutes behind.</p>
<p>The severe twists of the narrow final descent over most of the remaining 20 kilometres caught out several riders, often at 60 kph.</p>
<p>Colombian Jose Gonzalez was among the leaders until he crashed into a grass bank.</p>
<p>He came in with Tonkov's group, but Shefer and Leonardo Piepoli fought back from a spill with a TV motorcycle to contest the finishing sprint.</p>
<p>Piepoli, who finished fifth, also rose to fifth place overall. He was the only faller who needed medical treatment, having stitches for a cut chin.</p>
<p>The leaders' final close encounter came when Axel Merckx, son of five times Giro winner Eddy, led the group out of a corner. The Belgian and his co-leaders had to switch violently to avoid a photographer's motorcycle which had stopped.</p>
