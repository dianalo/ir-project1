<p>A Malaysian high court on Saturday acquitted two Turks of a charge of murdering a former member of the Canadian Air Force, the national Bernama news agency reported.</p>
<p>Justice Pajan Singh Gill directed a seven-member jury to return a verdict of not gulity on Olmez Orhan and Kocaslan Hidayet without their defence being called.</p>
<p>Orhan, 40, and Hidayet, 28, were jointly charged with the murder of John Gatley, 68, in central Cameron Highlands between February 10 and 11, 1994.</p>
<p>"The prosecution has no doubt proved that Gatley was murdered but has not linked the two to the death of the deceased," Gill said.</p>
<p>"Suspicion however strong cannot be substituted as direct evidence and is insufficient to prove that they caused the death of Gatley," he said.</p>
