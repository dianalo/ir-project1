<p>A six-day-old strike by one million postal and telephone workers in India appeared close to an end after an offer from Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda to meet trade unions, a labour leader said on Monday.</p>
<p>O.P. Gupta, head of the National Federation of Telecom Employees (NFTE), told Reuters labour leaders had been invited through an intermediary but said a word of assurance from Deve Gowda to meet their demands was not enough.</p>
<p>"Even if the meeting is held (today), the strike can be called off only in the afternoon," Gupta said, adding this meant work could actually resume only on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A senior government official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters the strike was expected to end later on Monday following a meeting of the unions with Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>But Gupta said differences within the prime minister's 13-party coalition, ranging from social democrats to communists, could hamper an early end to the strike.</p>
<p>Communications Minister Beni Prasad Varma belongs to the socialist Samajwadi Party. Deve Gowda belongs to the centre-left Janata Dal.</p>
<p>But an expected cabinet meeting on Tuesday could decide on the demand of six unions for the abolition of a 3,500-rupee ($100) ceiling on annual bonus payments, Gupta said.</p>
<p>The unions, three representing postal workers and three telecommunication workers, say Communications Minister Varma's promise to consider their demand was not sufficient.</p>
<p>The government, concerned over high interest rates and the cost of debt, had set itself an ambitious budget tightening target this year through a ceiling on bonus payments.</p>
<p>On the first day of the strike, Varma called the work stoppage illegal, saying the unions had not given adequate advance notice.</p>
<p>The strike has crippled government postal services with millions of letters piling up in post offices across the nation.</p>
<p>Telecommunications services, which are largely automated, have not been severely hit but operator-related services and repair and maintenance have been disrupted.</p>
