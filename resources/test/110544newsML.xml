<p>Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko stormed out of parliament on Friday and said he would "go directly to the people" after failing to win support for a referendum that could boost his political powers.</p>
<p>Lukashenko, accused by opponents of an authoritarian style of government, withdrew proposals intended to reach a compromise with parliament in a dispute over a planned referundum on the constitution.  </p>
<p>"I do not see any opportunity to find a compromise in this parliament. I will go directly to the people and I will withdraw my initiative, and the people will be our judge," Lukashenko said.</p>
<p>Lukashenko made his compromise proposal on Thursday but was angered after his plans were criticised by the head of the constitutional court.</p>
<p>The referendum scheduled for November 7 would grant Lukashenko a 10-year mandate and has been sharply criticised by parliamentarians in the former Soviet republic.</p>
<p>Lukashenko had held out an olive branch by offering deputies wider powers if they shelved plans for a separate referendum on their own proposed constitution planned for November 24, but he had vowed to press on with his own referendum.</p>
