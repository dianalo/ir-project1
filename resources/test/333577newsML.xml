<p>The U.S. oil company Pennzoil Co said on Sunday it would drill two wells to explore oil and gas in Qatar this year.</p>
<p>"We plan to drill two exploratory wells and carry out seismic survey over an additional 400 square km offshore area," said Walter Theis, vice-president and general manager of Pennzoil-Qatar.</p>
<p>The U.S. company has a production sharing agreement with the state's Qatar General Petroleum Corporation to explore and produce oil and gas at block 8, spread over a 2,850 square km offshore area.</p>
<p>Theis told reporters tenders would go out soon to acquire rigs for the new round of drilling. But he did not specify if the upcoming drilling would be vertical, horizontal or deviational.</p>
<p>Last year Pennzoil vertically drilled its first well, 250 km northeast of Doha. "But the discovery was not viable enough to start commercial operation," Theis said.</p>
