<p>The European Commission said on Friday it had cleared British Airways Plc's proposed acquisition of insolvent French airline Air Liberte.</p>
<p>BA already owns French carrier TAT. Air Liberte went into receivership in September. Both operate mainly in the French market out of the coveted Paris Orly airport.</p>
<p>"The Commission has examined the effects of the operation as concerns routes and in particular on the Paris-Toulouse route on which British Airways/TAT and Air Liberte both operate," it said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The Commission has come to the conclusion that the operation...does not create a dominant position," it added.</p>
<p>A Commission spokesman had told Reuters earlier this week that the deal would be approved.</p>
