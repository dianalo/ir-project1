<p>Yugoslav money supply has continued expanding in the past few months and is approaching seven billion dinars ($1.175 billion), the Belgrade-based Economics Institute said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Money supply has continued to grow in June and July. Whether it is now closer to six or seven billion dinar mark, I would say seven," Miroljub Labus, a prominent economist with the institute, told reporters.</p>
<p>According to the latest central bank data, M1 money supply in May stood at 5.933 billion dinars, up 6.7 percent from the 5.562 billion in April. The central bank publishes money supply data with up to two months delay.</p>
<p>The 643 million dinars rise in M1 in April and May alone led to a reduction in interest rates, although they were still prohibitively high, the institute said in its latest report.</p>
<p>The central bank discount rate was 2.6 percent per month in real terms, while real interest rates on the money market in June were slightly below seven percent.</p>
<p>It was a question how long money supply could continue to grow at such a rate before causing disruptions, Labus said.</p>
<p>While most macro-economic indicators were stable, including the dinar exchange rate and retail prices, wages jumped 9.9 percent to 807 dinars in June against May, when they were just 0.1 percent up on the previous month.</p>
<p>There was obviously a causal link between the money supply growth and the abrupt rise in June wages, the institute said. But the expansive monetary policy has not yet reflected on improvement in production and exports, while unemployment was still rising.</p>
<p>A monetary expansion in the last days of 1996 pushed the dinar black market rate down to 4.3 dinars to the German mark, its lowest since 1995 when it was officially set at 3.3 dinars to the mark to bring it in line with the then street value.</p>
<p>The central bank began withdrawing money to stabilise the market and restore financial discipline, but M1 began growing again in March.</p>
<p>The dinar's street value has been relatively stable since at 3.5 to 3.6 dinars to the mark.</p>
