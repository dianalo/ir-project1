<p>UUNET Technologies Inc said on Thursday it projected extraordinarily rapid bandwidth growth for the Internet and said it was essential for Internet service providers to have direct cost control of that bandwidth.</p>
<p>"Right now we are planning in the next three years for a network that is a thousand times faster than our current Internet network at UUNET," UUNET chief executive officer John Sidgmore told the Internet World conference here.</p>
<p>In the computer industry, the maxim states that computer performance relative to cost doubles every eighteen months, Sidgmore said.  But in the Internet industry, growth in bandwidth was doubling every three to four months, he said.</p>
<p>UUNET is a unit MFS Communications Co Inc. In August, MFS and WorldCom Inc announced plans to merge late this year or early in 1997.</p>
