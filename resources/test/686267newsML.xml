<p>The United States and India signed a treaty on Wednesday for the extradition of fugitives that both hailed as an big step to tighten law enforcement cooperation .</p>
<p>Under the treaty, each country commits itself to extraditing fugitives accused or convicted of offences punishable by more than one year in each country.</p>
<p>It also provides a legal basis for either government to arrest fugitives immediately on the request of the other government to prevent flight. Fugitives would be extradited under the treaty regardless of their nationality.</p>
<p>"The signing of this treaty is a major accomplishment and an important step in U.S.-India law enforcement cooperation," a joint statement said.</p>
<p>"The United States and India look forward to bringing this important treaty into force in the near future," it added. In the United States, treaties must be ratified by the Senate to take effect.</p>
<p>The treaty was signed by the Indian minister of state for external affairs, Saleem Shervani, and by U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott. It replaces a 1931 extradition treaty.</p>
