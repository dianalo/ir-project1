<p>The United States and other western nations joined on Friday in condemning a Palestinian Moslem suicide bomber's attack on a crowded Tel Aviv cafe in which three people, including the bomber died, and 43 were hurt.</p>
<p>"I condemn it...," U.S. President Bill Clinton told a news conference in Helsinki after a summit with Russian President Boris Yeltsin. "There is no place for such acts of terror and violence in the peace process."</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel sent a telegram of condolence to his Israeli counterpart, David Levi, saying the attack, which he said was intended to harm the Middle East peace process, filled him with "disgust and indignation".</p>
<p>In Rome, Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi condemned the bombing as an attempt to derail Middle East peace.</p>
<p>"As in the past terrorism has struck at innocent people in an attempt to hijack the peace process," Prodi said in a message of condolence to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>"It is a flawed strategy which has to be answered by giving a substantial boost to the negotiations," he added.</p>
<p>The French foreign ministry issued a statement expressing horror over the bombing and urging all sides in the Middle East to show restraint to prevent further violence.</p>
<p>"The French government learned with horror and consternation of the heinous attack that has just been committed in Tel Aviv. It expresses it sympathy to the families of the victims," the statement said.</p>
<p>France also voiced concern over violence in Hebron and Jerusalem, where Palestinians are protesting against the construction of a disputed Jewish settlement in Arab East Jerusalem.</p>
