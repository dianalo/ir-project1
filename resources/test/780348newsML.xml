<p>Pressure mounted on executives of South Korea's troubled Kia Group on Tuesday as the government said yet again it would not intervene and auto industry leaders worried openly about the spillover effect of Kia's problems.</p>
<p>Analysts said the group's days were numbered and executives would be forced to accede to creditors' demands and step down, setting the stage for a third-party takeover.</p>
<p>Creditor banks on Monday tempted the eighth-ranked conglomerate with 183.1 billion won ($205.9 million) in emergency loans to four Kia units, including flagship Kia Motors Corp.</p>
<p>They also suspended Kia's debt payments until September 29.</p>
<p>But creditors said the loans would be granted only after top group executives tendered resignation letters and the labour union agreed in writing to freeze wages and cut employees.</p>
<p>Kia chairman Kim Sun-hong has refused to resign, while the union has vowed to fight any moves to force management out.</p>
<p>"I don't think Kia can last more than one month," said James Son, auto analyst at SBC Warburg.</p>
<p>"Pressure will come from many sides. A lot of subcontractors will experience extreme difficulties, and eventually they will send an SOS to the government and to the creditors."</p>
<p>Kia's estimated 5,000 subcontractors are already hurting.</p>
<p>The chief executives of Hyundai Motor Co and other top automakers on Tuesday pleaded for government help.</p>
<p>Hyundai Motor chairman Chung Mong-kyu said most Kia subcontractors also supplied parts to other automakers. If they default because of Kia, other automakers would suffer, he said.</p>
<p>Earlier, finance minister Kang Kyong-shik reiterated the government's position that it would not intervene.</p>
<p>"The government has no intention and will never intervene in any takeover bid or industrial restructuring programme," Kang said in a meeting with Kia creditor banks.</p>
<p>"The government believes creditors made the right decision and fully supports it," he said.</p>
<p>Lee Jung-ja, head of research at HSBC James Capel, said Kang's comment signalled creditors would decide Kia's future.</p>
<p>"I think the banking sector wants to sell Kia to a third party. But they want to do it more easily so they are going through a process," Lee said.</p>
<p>"Creditors will continue to pressure management. Without emergency loans I don't think Kia can last more than a week or 10 days," she said.</p>
<p>The finance ministry denied a news report that it was considering allowing state-run Korea Development Bank to take over Kia Motors.</p>
<p>Munhwa Ilbo newspaper said it had obtained an internal government report outlining a scenario where Kia Motors would be pushed into court receivership and, ultimately, into the state-run bank's hands, if Kia Group rejected creditor demands.</p>
<p>"The report is totally groundless. We have never considered such an issue," finance ministry spokesman Chung Euy-dong said.</p>
<p>Analysts said such a move would be a step backwards.</p>
<p>"People looking at Korea from the outside would see a retrograde move where the Korean government would be engaging in nationalisation of private industry," said Henry Morris, managing director of Coryo International (H.K) Ltd.</p>
<p>The Kia Group, with 38 affiliates at home and abroad, recorded a combined net loss of 129.4 billion won in calendar 1996 on combined sales of 12.1 trillion won. The group's debts were estimated at 9.5 trillion won as of the end of May.</p>
