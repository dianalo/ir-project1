<p>The longest-ever U.S. Open course played longer, and the difficult greens grew more difficult to read after another lengthy delay Saturday stretched the patience and skills of the world's best golfers.</p>
<p>Bogeys littered the leaderboard after a sudden, violent thunderstorm swept over the sprawling Congressional layout late in the afternoon, forcing a two-hour stoppage.</p>
<p>No one suffered more than Masters champion Tiger Woods, who bogeyed four of the last five holes he played after the delay before darkness mercifully fell as he finished the 16th.</p>
<p>Woods, hoping to extend an incredible string of six successive years with a U.S. national championship -- having won three U.S. Junior and three U.S. Amateur titles -- stood at four over par, eight strokes behind leader Jeff Maggert.</p>
<p>The greatest U.S. Open come-from-behind win came in 1960 when Arnold Palmer charged back from seven strokes back to win at Cherry Hills.</p>
<p>Woods said anything is possible.</p>
<p>"It depends on what the leaders are doing and, obviously, what I do," said the supremely confident 21-year-old.</p>
<p>"If I play well, I can give myself a chance at winning. But it all depends on the leaders, whether they keep going forward or they stay right there."</p>
<p>Maggert did the best job of limiting his bogey-damage after the delay by taking only one to stand four-under through 14 holes. Tom Lehman, the reigning British Open champion, lost two strokes to par for second place at three-under after finishing 13 holes.</p>
<p>Twenty-one players were still on the course when play ended Saturday due to failing light. They will return at 7 a.m. (1100 gmt) on Sunday to finish before setting out on the final round.</p>
<p>Pleasant weather is predicted for Sunday, which would be a welcome break after the threat of lightning the last two days that kept the field from being able to finish the second and third rounds on the appointed day.</p>
<p>But the rain and humid air have already done their damage. The soggy fairways offered little roll to tee shots, the wet rough turned even more wretched, the damp sand terrorised players with bunker shots and the greens changed speed.</p>
<p>"It played awfully long," said Jay Haas, who was the leader in the clubhouse at even-par after completing a round of two-under 68.</p>
<p>Said Lehman about the damp, misty conditions, "It made a two-club difference.</p>
<p>"With the haze you couldn't see the shots land. I never saw a shot land after we resumed," he added.</p>
<p>Woods conjured up some occasional magic, like at the 11th -- his first hole after the delay -- where he used a three-wood to putt the ball up a bank and onto the green, where it rolled straight into the cup for a birdie that temporarily put him at level par.</p>
<p>"I might have to use it on the short putts, too," joked Woods, whose last three bogeys came as he three-putted.</p>
<p>"I could never get the speed right," Woods said about the water-soaked greens. "When you're playing greens this fast, you have to have the speed. I just didn't have my speed."</p>
<p>Woods showed other flashes of brilliance, sticking the occasional approach shot stunningly close, but has not been able to sustain his best form.</p>
<p>"I've had four, five, six good holes and then I'll lose it. It's never stayed with me all the way around," he said. "I've never had the flow of my golf swing all 18 holes or my putting stroke.</p>
<p>"And when you're playing on a golf course this severe you'll pay the price eventually."</p>
