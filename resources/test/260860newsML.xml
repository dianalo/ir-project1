<p>Ivory Coast on Tuesday announced details of offers by three foreign firms for the takeover of its state-owned telephone company, CI-TELCOM, the biggest remaining enterprise on its privatisation list.</p>
<p>Bids by three consortia involving rival French, Malaysian and Ivorian firms, were opened in public at the headquarters of Ivory Coast's Privatisation Committee.</p>
<p>France Telecom threw in a sweetener by agreeing to pay off CI-TELCOM's debt of 40 billion CFA francs ($76 million), the bulk of which is owed to itself as a major supplier and technical partner to the Ivorian state firm.</p>
<p>France Telecom, bidding through a local consortium led by its subsidiary France Cable Radio offered to pay 103 billion CFA for the 204,000 shares or 51 percent of CI-TELCOM being sold by the government to a strategic partner.</p>
<p>It offered to pay off CI-TELCOM's debt through state bank Caisse Autonome d'Amortissements over 10 years.</p>
<p>France Telecom's total investment commitments would amount to 136 billion CFA francs, according to its bidding letter read out at the session by an official of Ivory Coast's Privatisation Committee, Pierre Bitty.</p>
<p>In its presentation, France Telecom emphasised its close links with Ivory Coast, a former French colony.</p>
<p>It expects other interests to join the consortium, notably the Commonwealth Development Corp, the African Development Bank and the Lome-based West African Development Bank.</p>
<p>Ivorian-owned company, Africa Bell, made the highest cash bid of 106.6 billion CFA for the 204,000 shares and also agreed to pay 100 percent of an 11 billion CFA capital increase envisaged for the privatised CI-TELCOM.</p>
<p>Africa Bell's Bernard Houdin told Reuters the company had signed a technical agreement for the management of CI-TELCOM with Global Communications Services, a unit of AT&amp;T.</p>
<p>Telekom Malaysia, which is raising its profile in the region, made the lowest cash offer of 82.4 billion CFA for the shares. It offered to pay the 11 billion in capital increase direct to CI-TELCOM.</p>
<p>The Malaysians are counting on their experience in running the privatised telephone company in Guinea for which they paid $45 million last December. Officials of the company also say they are confident of clinching the deal to run Ghana's state telephone network, bids for which were opened on Monday.</p>
<p>Malaysia Telekom's Mohd Kamal Abu Bakar told Reuters his company planned total new investments of about $300 million if it won the CI-TELCOM franchise.</p>
<p>The winner will take a 51 to 55 percent stake in CI-TELCOM, the state will retain 35 percent, eight to 10 percent will be sold to Ivorian shareholders on the Abidjan stock exchange and staff will be offered one to two percent.</p>
<p>Estimates of the total value of CI-TELCOM range from $200 million to $350 million.</p>
<p>It is heavily indebted, the bulk of it to France Telecom.</p>
<p>Industry analysts say the eventual winner will inherit a bloated payroll and an ageing network that requires huge injection of cash for modernisation and increased telephone penetration.</p>
<p>U.S. industry sources said major U.S. carriers, notably AT&amp;T and MCI Communications Corp who have international circuits into Ivory Coast, showed initial interest in the bid but eventually backed out mainly because of the cost.</p>
