<p>Ousted premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh condemned Cambodian strongman Hun Sen on Saturday for rejecting mediation efforts, saying it would bring about isolation, an end to democracy and a return to civil war.</p>
<p>"In rejecting ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) mediation, I think Hun Sen is now isolating Cambodia by himself," Ranariddh said.</p>
<p>"Now I'm really afraid, we will have again a civil war in my country." said a solemn Ranariddh in his first news conference in the region since being ousted when Hun Sen's troops made a bloody power grab on July 5-6. He left the country on the eve of the fighting.</p>
<p>"I'm very sad for my country. From now on democracy is finished, it is ended in Cambodia."</p>
<p>Ranariddh made the comments shortly after Second Prime Minister Hun Sen rejected ASEAN's efforts to find a peaceful solution to the problem in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Indonesian foreign minister Ali Alatas, one of three ASEAN foreign ministers trying to mediate between the opposing Cambodian factions, told reporters in Phnom Penh Hun Sen had rejected ASEAN's efforts.</p>
<p>Ranariddh said he had told the foreign ministers during a meeting here on Friday that he would agree to name a replacement for him as long as Hun Sen agreed to several pre-conditions.</p>
<p>But the plan would not work since the talks failed. Ranariddh said he had expected Hun Sen to reject the mediation, and said the decision would only hurt Cambodia.</p>
<p>"Hun Sen and his colleagues...are clearly responsible for the recurrence of a new civil war in Cambodia. In staging his bloody coup d'etat, in continuing the killing and mass executions like Pol Pot...in rejecting ASEAN mediation, Hun Sen and his colleagues are alone responsible for the suffering and destruction in Cambodia."</p>
<p>Ranariddh said he had heard at least 100 opposition politicians -- many from his FUNCINPEC party -- had been killed across the country and about 1,000 detained in the wake of the coup.</p>
<p>Diplomatic sources in Phnom Penh have said there were at least 40 politically motivated killings after Ranariddh's ouster. Most were in the capital and neighbouring provinces.</p>
<p>"Hun Sen is a murderous prime minister ... Hun Sen's hands are as bloody as Pol Pot's," Ranariddh said, referring to the Khmer Rouge leader who was responsible for the deaths of about one million Cambodians during the group's violent 1975-79 rule.</p>
<p>Ranariddh also announced that FUNCINPEC party and three other parties were forming a movement aimed at finding a non-violent, diplomatic solution to the political crisis.</p>
<p>He said the movement, the Union of Cambodian Democrats (UCD), wanted all the nations of the world to reject "the illegitimate government" in Phnom Penh and to comdemn the slaughter of innocent people.</p>
<p>The UCD also urged all nations to suspend international assistance to Hun Sen's government and to channel humanitarian assistance through non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p>It called on signatories of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords to recall their ambassadors from Phnom Penh to protest against the violation of the accord.</p>
<p>The international peace treaty laid the ground for U.N.-sponsored elections in 1993. Ranariddh won the poll and agreed to a power-sharing coalition with Hun Sen.</p>
