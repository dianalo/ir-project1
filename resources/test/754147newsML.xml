<p>The mark eased a touch on most of the European crosses after the Bundesbank kept key interest rates on hold and set the rate for the next two repo tenders at a fixed, unchanged three percent.</p>
<p>Movements on the European crosses were confined to narrow ranges, dealers said. But the mark dropped further against the dollar though after the Bundesbank annoucement. Dollar/mark set a fresh six-year high above 1.83 marks.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank's decision was in line with expectations even though vague talk that the German central bank might switch to a variable rate had circulated in the market ahead of the meeting.</p>
<p>"The dollar's break higher against the mark showed that some people expected a change in rates but the impact on the European cross rates has been very limited," said Robert Prior, European economist at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>Analysts questioned why the Bundesbank fixed the next two weekly repo tenders rather than covering the whole four-week summer recess with one repo.</p>
<p>"This is likely to keep some speculation about the repo rate alive and keeps the option open to switch to a variable rate," said Prior.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank kept the discount rate at 2.50 percent, and held the Lombard rate at 4.50 percent. It left the M3 money supply target corridor unchanged at 3.5 to 6.5 percent.</p>
<p>Dealers said the mark was consolidating on the crosses after selling pressure earlier this week.</p>
<p>It firmed above 4.28 against the Swedish crown in a technical rebound after sliding to a 4 1/2 year low at 4.2795 on Wednesday. Mark/crown was at 4.2840/70 at 1210 GMT, from 4.2805/35 in late European trading on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Against the Swiss franc it failed to hold on to earlier gains and slid back within a whisker of strong support at 81 centimes. Mark/Swiss was at 81.08/10 from 81.28/38.  </p>
<p>Mark/lira was at 972.15/45 against 972.25/50. Mark/peseta was unchanged at 84.22/23.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank kept the discount rate at 2.50 percent and held the Lombard rate at 4.50 percent. It left the M3 money supply target corridor unchanged at 3.5 to 6.5 percent.</p>
<p>Despite today's consolidative tone, analysts said the big picture of further mark weakness was intact.</p>
<p>Michael Lewis, senior international economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said he did not expect the Bundesbank to intervene to limit the mark's decline. "There's no obstacle to further mark weakness," he said.</p>
<p>The German currency has been hit by the growing perception that European economic and monetary union will start on time in 1999 with a broad group of members.</p>
<p>The likely inclusion of currencies seen as traditionally less stable, like the Italian lira, has raised expectations that the euro will be weak.</p>
<p>The prospect of the mark's disappearance within 18 months into an uncertain euro has combined with a horizon of relatively low German interest rates and prolonged European economic restructuring to push traders out of the mark for now.</p>
<p>This in turn has boosted currencies not expected to be in the first wave of EMU, such as sterling, the Swiss franc and the Swedish crown.</p>
