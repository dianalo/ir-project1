<p>North Korea on Monday handed over the remains of four U.S. soldiers killed during the 1950-1953 Korean War, an apparent goodwill gesture on the eve of landmark four-nation talks, witnesses said.</p>
<p>At the tense Korean border, North Korean officers delivered four coffins draped in United Nations flags to representatives of the U.S.-led United Nations Command.  </p>
<p>The repatriation of the remains comes as the two Koreas, the United States and China prepared for a meeting on Tuesday in New York aimed at setting a date, venue and agenda for their peace talks.</p>
<p>The talks are aimed at hammering out a permanent peace mechanism on the Korean peninsula, the last Cold War flashpoint, to replace the 1953 armistice that ended the Korean War.</p>
<p>The United State backed the capitalist South during the war and China the communist North.</p>
<p>A team of 10 U.S. experts has been searching in North Korea since mid-July for remains of Americans missing in action from the war.</p>
