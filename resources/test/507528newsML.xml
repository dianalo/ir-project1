<p>The differential between UK gilts and Bunds is expected to narrow over the next two years as growth in Britain slows while German growth accelerates, a Reuters survey showed on Monday.</p>
<p>The mean of forecasts showed that the gilt/Bund yield spread is expected to fall to 157 basis points by end-1997 from current levels of around 185 basis points.</p>
<p>By end-1998, expectations of a rise in Bund yields will see the gap narrow to 118 basis points, the quarterly survey of economic indicators, exchange and interest rates showed.</p>
<p>Economic growth in Britain will slow to sustainable levels as interest rates are raised and gilt yields rise. But Bund yields will be relatively higher, analysts said.</p>
<p>"We are nervous about continental European bond markets. We see a gently deteriorating Bund market as German growth becomes more robust," said Philip Shaw, UK economist at Union Plc .</p>
<p>The mean of up to 23 forecasts shows gilt yields are expected to rise to 7.83 percent by first quarter 1998 before tailing off to 7.59 percent by end-1998 from around 7.6 percent now.</p>
<p>By end of first quarter 1999 gilt yields are expected to fall to 7.41 percent.</p>
<p>Thirty-two banks, investment and research organisations contributed to the survey carried out between April 7 and 9.</p>
<p>Forecasts for the differential between gilts and Bunds ranged from 120 basis points to 200 basis points for end-1997, and between 75 and 180 for end-1998.</p>
<p>Sterling strength versus the mark is expected to hold down British import prices while the weak German currency will serve to exaggerate the country's export recovery. Once markets start speculating about higher German interest rates, Bund prices will inevitably fall, analysts said.</p>
<p>On Friday, sterling broke through 2.8000 marks, the highest level for 4-1/2 years.</p>
<p>Alex Garrard, UK economist at UBS, said the political uncertainty normally priced into bond markets would also be reduced after the May 1 election. The opposition Labour party is widely expected to win the election.</p>
<p>Another encouraging factor for gilt yields is that expectations of a Conservative loss had not had the normal effect of a massive sell-off British assets.</p>
<p>Labour has wooed the business community. Many people believe the party's tax and spend days are over, analysts said.</p>
<p>"We expect a Labour government and once they begin to prove their credibility the gilt/Bund differential will narrow," said Shaw.</p>
<p>Britain is unlikely to join European economic and monetary union (EMU) when it begins on January 1, 1999. But the chances of it joining in the second wave are good, analysts say. This is also good news for the gilt/bund spread.</p>
<p>These chances are also seen to be better with a Labour government, which traditionally has been friendlier towards EMU and the single currency project.</p>
<p>"If the markets perceive a greater likelihood of the UK joining in the second wave, gilts will benefit from convergence trades," Garrard said.</p>
<p>Expectations of a broad-based EMU, which would include Italy, have seen differentials between Italian bonds and Bunds narrow to around 175 basis points from 475 basis points in January 1996.</p>
