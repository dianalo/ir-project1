<p>Two of European soccer's most evocative names, Juventus and Manchester United, venture into a whole new ball game on Wednesday as Europe's top clubs embark on a Champions' League season of dramatic potential.</p>
<p>For the first time since the tournament was revamped to incorporate group stages, guaranteeing more income for those involved, there are no restrictions on the number of foreigners a club can field.</p>
<p>The Bosman ruling has resulted in a flood of international activity since last season and nowhere will the new era be better illustrated than the Stadio Delle Alpi in Turin.</p>
<p>There are likely to be 11 different nationalities represented on the field, from Urugayan Paolo Montero to Dutchman Jordi Cruyff, and for United, in particular, the end to their perpetual eligibility problems transforms their prospects.</p>
<p>A 4-0 win over Leeds in the English premier league suggested they are also running into some form, in contrast to Juventus's low-key 1-1 draw at Reggiana on the opening day of the Italian league season.</p>
<p>Yet the reigning European champions know there is plenty of football to be played between now and May, and coach Marcello Lippi is sounding positive.</p>
<p>"Reggiana had one shot in the entire game and scored. Our performance augurs well not just for the tie with Manchester but also for the entire season."</p>
<p>Lippi will have to find replacements for defender Moreno Torricelli and Serb midfielder Vladmir Jugovic, both suspended.</p>
<p>Experienced midfielder Antonio Conte, who missed Sunday's game through suspension, will probably replace Jugovic and play alongside Frenchmen Zinedine Zidane and Didier Deschamps.</p>
<p>Italy's other Champions League entrants AC Milan limbered up for their home tie with Porto by recovering from a 1-0 halftime deficit to defeat newly promoted Verona 4-1.</p>
<p>New Milan coach, Uruguyan Oscar Washington Tabarez, now faces a difficult choice with four outstanding players - Montenegrin Dejan Savicevic, Roberto Baggio, Marco Simone and Liberian George Weah - in contention for three places.</p>
<p>Savicevic, who was suspended for Sunday's game, may come in at the expense of Baggio, since Tabarez could be reluctant to drop either of his in-form strikers, Weah and Simone.</p>
<p>Porto, meanwhile, are unable to call on Austrian midfielder Arnold Wetl. Wetl, a close-season signing from Sturm Graz, was not registered in time with UEFA and will be unable to take part in European competition before January.</p>
<p>Several of the other supposedly elite clubs in Europe have made surprisingly sluggish domestic starts, not least losing European finalists Ajax Amsterdam.</p>
<p>The Dutch champions have had a wretched time, taking just seven points from five first division games and are already eight points adrift of leaders PSV Eindhoven.</p>
<p>Injuries to Danny Blind and Patrick Kluivert plus the loss of Michael Reiziger, Finidi George, Edgar Davids and Nwankwo Kanu during the close season have sapped confidence and Blind, Richard Witschge, Nordin Wooter and Dani are all suspended for the encounter with French champions Auxerre.</p>
<p>The team from Burgundy beat Ajax in the UEFA Cup quarter-finals two and a half years ago, but Auxerre coach Guy Roux remains wary.</p>
<p>"What is impressive with Ajax is their discipline, their fidelity to the style they have chosen to play. It is very difficult to instil such discipline into French players," said Roux, on the bench for his 43rd European competition game.</p>
<p>Auxerre will be without defender and captain Franck Silvestre, out for two months with a shoulder injury.</p>
<p>Atletico Madrid's opener against Steaua Bucharest will be the first game played at the Vicente Calderon stadium since an invasion of worms at the ground in August.</p>
<p>On Monday, American experts were still supervising the installation of new turf laid over the old grass, a job hampered by the heavy rain which fell in the Spanish capital over the weekend.</p>
<p>The pitch will not be Atletico's only problem. Influential international playmaker Jose Luis Caminero and fellow midfielder Juan Vizcaino will almost certainly miss Atletico's first European Cup game for 20 years through injury.</p>
<p>Their absence was felt in Saturday's 3-1 defeat at Compostela, the first occasion under coach Radomir Antic in which Atletico have conceded three goals away from home.</p>
<p>Steaua, who beat Barcelona on penalties to take the European Cup home from Seville 10 years ago, will also be without three key men.</p>
<p>Top scorer Adrian Ilie has been banned for three games after being sent off in the preliminary round against Belgian champions Club Brugge in Bucharest. Midfielder Iulian Filipescu is also suspended and striker Marius Lacatus is injured.</p>
<p>Also in group B, Borussia Dortmund take on Poland's Widzew Lodz hoping to overcome a lengthy injury list and modest form, summed up by a scrambled 1-0 weekend win over Hansa Rostock courtesy of a hotly-disputed last-minute goal.</p>
<p>Ghanaian striker Ibrahim Tanko has a torn hamstring, Karlheinz Riedle has a neck injury which is taking time to heal and attacking midfielder Paulo Sousa, defensive midfielder Steffen Freund and defender Rene Schneider are long-term casualties.</p>
<p>Trainer Ottmar Hitzfeld has little choice but to field out-of-form Swiss striker Stephane Chapuisat up front. He may also decide to give a debut to teenage American striker Jovan Kirovski, who failed to get a British work permit and switched from Manchester United in the close season.</p>
<p>Rapid Vienna's impressive 2-0 weekend win over current Austrian first division leaders SV Salzburg has raised their hopes of a home win over Turkey's Fenerbahce, while Grasshoppers Zurich are hoping for more luck in front of goal against Scottish champions Glasgow Rangers.</p>
<p>They have been involved in two goalless draws in the past week.</p>
