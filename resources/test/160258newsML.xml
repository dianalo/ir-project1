<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss bond market closing report.</title>
<headline>Swiss bond market closing report.</headline>

<p>Swiss bonds ended lower, extending declines after U.S. payrolls pushed Treasuries and the dollar higher.</p>
<p>Prices in the short end of the market were off sharply, and also fell relative to the long end.</p>
<p>The Swiss franc's declines to roughly 21-month lows against the dollar and mark put further upward pressure on Swiss short-term rates. Traders said the curve flattened partly as a result of nervousness about prospects for higher German short-term rates before a speech by Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing at 1600 GMT on Friday after the market closed.  </p>
<p>Issing said despite signs to the contrary, inflation in Germany is not dead. Issing also said that he believed Germany would meet Maastricht criteria but it would be difficult.</p>
<p>The dollar and mark rose to 21-month highs versus the Swiss currency earlier in the day after release of U.S. payrolls. October payrolls rose by 210,000 jobs, roughly in line with analysts' forecasts, while hourly earnings were flat for the first time in months.</p>
<p>Some traders welcomed the increased volume, especially in EuroSwiss futures. "It has been a better week all round. It has been a dreadful couple of months," one trader said.  </p>
<p>Swiss bonds continued falling late in the day as U.S. bonds retreated from post-payroll highs.</p>
<p>The Swiss December Confederate Bond futures contract also continued falling late in the day, but remained above the week's low of 114.15 seen October 29, which was also the low of the month. The level was also tested on October 17.</p>
<p>The contract closed right near the day session low, however of 114.31. Analysts remain divided on near-term direction.</p>
<p>Christian Heyden at CS Research, said in a market comment this week that CS raised its one-month forecast for 10-year Swiss federal bond yields to 4.00 percent from 3.80 percent.  </p>
<p>But Bank Leu analyst Ernst Zbinden saw Swiss bond prices remaining fairly flat with a slight upside bias. -- Friday closing prices</p>
