<p>The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) plans to study the impact of the killer disease AIDS on farming production in rural Zimbabwe, an FAO official said on Monday.</p>
<p>Erich Baier, a senior officer for agricultural education and extension, told reporters his organisation had already studied the potential impact of AIDS on food production systems in Rwanda, Tanzania and Malawi.</p>
<p>Studies in these countries showed that rural communities had been most hit by AIDS, which was claiming a majority of its victims from the productive 15- to 40 age group, he said.</p>
<p>Baier said the study on Zimbabwe -- where AIDS is killing an estimated 300 people every week and where a 10th of the 10.5 million population are believed to have the HIV virus that causes the disease -- would start soon, but he gave no date.</p>
<p>The FAO official said there was now need to use more machinery to break rural Africa's reliance on labour-intensive food production methods.</p>
