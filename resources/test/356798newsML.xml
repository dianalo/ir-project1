<p>Slovakia posted a lower than forecast rise in industrial production for 1996 on Wednesday, but analysts said the slowdown would not affect overall economic growth.</p>
<p>The Slovak Statistical Bureau (SUSR) said total industrial output was worth 531.8 billion crowns ($16.5 billion) last year, a real year-on-year increase of 2.5 percent, compared with 2.7 percent growth in 1995.</p>
<p>The bureau had originally forcecast growth at 3.0 to 3.2 percent and the economics ministry had seen industrial output up about five percent in 1996. However, analysts said they had expected the lower growth.</p>
<p>"The slower growth of industrial production was just in line with our forecasts, and the lower figure is nothing dramatic," said analyst Martin Barto of ING Barings Bratislava.</p>
<p>He said the slowdown may have been partially caused by lower production in the oil processing industry and the decline in world prices in the paper industry, which both account for a significant part of Slovakia's industrial output.</p>
<p>The SUSR has forecast 1996 GDP growth at 6.8 to 7.0 percent year-on-year, compared with a 7.4 percent increase in 1995. Real GDP grew 7.0 percent in the first three quarters of 1996.</p>
<p>"But we do not think that the slowdown in industrial output growth will negatively influence GDP growth for 1996 as services are expected to compensate for the shortfall," Barto said.</p>
<p>The detailed structure of industrial output has not been made available. The economics ministry said it would not comment on the figures as it had yet to analyse them.</p>
<p>Vladimir Kuklis of CSOB Bank welcomed the full year industrial production growth as a positive signal but said the figures had to be examined more deeply.</p>
<p>"We have to ask where the production went... whether it did not just go to stock building," he said. "We will only be able to analyse the development after we see the breakdown of the figures."</p>
<p>However, Kuklis was concerned that future industrial production might be hit by high interbank money market rates.</p>
<p>Rates jumped to around 27 percent at the beginning of January, after the central bank moved to rein in rapid growth in money supply and cool off the consumption-led boom.</p>
<p>Rates have since retreated, ranging on Wednesday between 20.5 and 21.0 percent on overnight money and 17.5-18.0 percent for six-month funds.</p>
<p>"Industrial production may crash if the rates hold at their current high levels for long, as even big companies often use short-term credits to refinance their operation," Kuklis said.</p>
<p>Industry would need rates to fall to around 14 to 15 percent on the interbank market, bringing credit prices to what he called an acceptable level, 16 percent.</p>
<p>"High interest rates may also generate inflationary pressures if companies add the higher cost of credits to their prices, and this could also hurt their competitiveness," he added.</p>
<p>Barto said the expected recovery in the main western European export markets could boost industrial output growth this year.</p>
<p>The SUSR has forecast industrial production growth of around 3.5 to 3.9 percent in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
