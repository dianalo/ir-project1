<p>South African President Nelson Mandela will visit India later this month to discuss business ties and the future of the Non-Aligned Movement, diplomats said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mandela will travel to New Delhi and then Bombay on the official visit, set to start on March 27 and to end either the next day or on March 29, they said.</p>
<p>The South African leader will come from Dhaka, where he will take part in the 25th anniversary celebrations of Bangladesh's independence on March 26.</p>
<p>Agreements to promote bilateral tourism and investment may be signed during Mandela's visit to India, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Talks will also focus on the Non-Aligned Movement, which holds a meeting of foreign ministers in New Delhi on April 7-8.</p>
<p>South Africa joined the movement, which includes more than 100 countries, mostly in the developing world, after the end of apartheid and the holding of elections in 1994.</p>
<p>South Africa is set to take over chairmanship of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1998. "We are new at the game and regard it as an important forum," a South African diplomat said.</p>
<p>Mandela last visited India in January 1995 when he was the official guest at Republic Day celebrations.</p>
