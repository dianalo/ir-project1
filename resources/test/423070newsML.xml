<p>High winds Thursday caused power outages around Connecticut, a Northeast Utilities spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>"We have about 9,000 customers out so far around the state of Connecticut," Northeast spokeswoman Myra Humphries said.</p>
<p>"Primarily, these are occurring now in the southeastern portion of the state, in the Stamford-Greenwich area, as the storm is tracking into the state of Connecticut," she said. "I certainly think that we could expect further outages today, if indeed the high winds that are predicted do come to fruition."</p>
<p>Humphries said Northeast was keeping a close eye on the wind storm, and that extra crews might have to be summoned to repair damage if it is severe enough.</p>
<p>Wind gusts of more than 50 mph were reported in the morning, and gusts of more than 60 mph were predicted in the afternoon.</p>
