<p>Semiconductor equipment maker ASM International NV said it expected the recovery of the industry to solidify and orders to continue to rise steadily.</p>
<p>"Due to the production time required between the receipt of the order and the shipment of the equipment, the contribution to profit from new incoming orders will mainly benefit the 1997 fourth quarter and 1998," it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Earlier the company reported a fall in second quarter net earnings to 1.7 million guilders versus 27.6 million guilders in the same period of 1996.</p>
<p>Net earnings per share were 0.05 guilders per share for the second quarter of 1997 versus 0.82 guilders a year ago.</p>
<p>"Although showing an improvement over the 1997 first quarter, increased depreciation and investments in new product development reduced the contribution of the incremental sales," it said.</p>
<p>Sales in the second quarter of 1997 were up 31 percent from the first quarter.</p>
<p>ASM International is listed on the Amsterdam Exchanges and on NASDAQ.</p>
