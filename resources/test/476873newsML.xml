<headline>Alkermes drug agent trial falls short, stock plunges.</headline>
<dateline>CAMBRIDGE, Mass.</dateline>
<text>
<p>Alkermes Inc. said Monday its drug delivery agent failed to perform as well as expected in a trial, causing the biotechnology firm's stock to lose more than 30 percent of its value.</p>
<p>The stock fell $6.25 to $14 on Nasdaq, where it was among the most-active issues.</p>
<p>Alkermes' drug delivery agent RMP-7 was designed to open the blood-brain barrier, which is tough to penetrate, so that drugs administered afterward may reach the brain to treat recurrent, malignant brain tumours.</p>
<p>The Cambridge, Mass.-based company said RMP-7 failed to achieve its objectives in the third Phase II trial of the agent. Alkermes previously did two successful Phase II trials of the agent in Europe.</p>
<p>If the third trial had been successful, Alkermes said it would have gone straight to the Food and Drug Administration for approval, bypassing Phase III trials.</p>
<p>However, Alkermes said it will now conduct Phase III clinical trials of the agent.</p>
