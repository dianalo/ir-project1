<p>President Leonid Kuchma's choice of a young banker with no government experience to run the economy sparked dismay among Western analysts on Wednesday and one said reforms had stalled so badly foreign aid could be at risk.</p>
<p>Serhiy Tyhypko, 37, took over as deputy prime minister in charge of economic issues from Viktor Pynzenyk, who resigned last week in anger at the slow pace of implementing his plans to pull the economy out of its five-year post-Soviet decline.</p>
<p>"It's certainly not a central European model of economic reform," one Western diplomat said of the appointment of the head of Privatbank, one of Ukraine's top five banks and based in the central industrial city of Dnipropetrovsk.</p>
<p>"This appointment does not exactly broaden the regional base of the Ukrainian government," the diplomat added.</p>
<p>Kuchma and Prime Minister Pavlo Lazarenko both have their political roots in Dnipropetrovsk, stemming from the time when the president ran the Soviet Union's biggest missile plant and the prime minister was a regional political boss.</p>
<p>Recent cabinet changes have tended to be interpreted as either strengthening or weakening the position of Lazarenko, a member of the Dnipropetrovsk "clan" seen as responsible for bankrolling Kuchma's election campaign in 1994.</p>
<p>"Either Kuchma wants to give Lazarenko the rope to hang himself with or the regional links are so strong they cannot get away from each other," the diplomat said.</p>
<p>Tyhypko, who has worked in banking since 1990, is a metallurgist by training with a reputation as an energetic, organised manager able to delegate. Colleagues contacted by Reuters on Wednesday said they were sure he would do a good job.</p>
<p>Vadim Hetman, deputy head of parliament's finance and banking committee also saw the move as positive but warned: "He is smart, but Ukraine does not need experiments now".</p>
<p>Another well-placed economist said reforms were doing so badly Ukraine could risk losing its status in Washington as the third biggest recipient of U.S. aid after Israel and Egypt.</p>
<p>"We are a little dismayed that instead of choosing someone who has a known economic background they have chosen someone from the (Dnipropetrovsk) clan," the economist said.</p>
<p>"Ukraine is closer than it has ever been to losing some of its U.S. aid," the economist added, saying there had been calls in Washington for part of economic aid to be limited.</p>
<p>Ukraine is due to receive $675 million in U.S. bilateral aid to support reforms, agriculture and the destruction of former Soviet missile bases this year.</p>
<p>Tyhypko, once a leader of the Komsomol communist youth wing in Dnipropetrovsk, faces a tough task getting reforms through parliament while convincing foreign lending bodies and donors that reforms are safe in his hands now Pynzenyk has gone.</p>
<p>Ukraine has failed since last November to pass a package of tax reforms to underpin this year's delayed budget and without them it cannot win a $2.5 to $3 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan on which its budget plans depend.</p>
<p>Analysts said the appointment would not necessarily affect talks with the IMF since reforms were set by Kuchma himself and he has repeatedly stressed that he will not change his policies.</p>
<p>But one economist expressed concern at comments by Kuchma late on Tuesday saying Ukraine could do without a budget until July if necessary.</p>
<p>Pynzenyk said last year that government officials were too worried about their own pockets to implement real reforms included in his tax package which he said would have reined in monopolies and averted further corruption in many sectors.</p>
