<p>At least 12 people were killed when a train and a bus collided at a railroad crossing in central Java after a guard left the gate unmanned to go to the toilet, news reports said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At least 10 people were injured in Tuesday's accident near the town of Solo, 480 km (300 miles) east of Jakarta, the reports said, adding that all the victims were in the bus.</p>
<p>The official Antara news agency quoted police as saying the gate to the crossing was open at the time the train passed because the guard had left his post to go to the toilet.</p>
<p>The bus was flung into the air then landed on its roof, it said.</p>
<p>State television said the guard had been taken into custody.</p>
<p>Antara said 12 people were killed but the Kompas newspaper put the toll at 13. Both said 10 people were injured.</p>
