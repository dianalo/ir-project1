<p>Italy's Banca Popolare di Milano faces sweeping management changes after Francesco Cesarini failed to be confirmed as chairman late Saturday at the end of a daylong general meeting packed with more than 6,000 shareholders.</p>
<p>The meeting was called to decide Cesarini's future with Popolare Milano three years after he took the helm of the Milan-based banking group, one of northern Italy's largest.  </p>
<p>Cesarini's proposal to reappoint eight members of the 16-strong company board was easily defeated by a rival list prepared by the Organismo di Rappresentanza (ODR), the committee formed to represent the 5,000 employee-shareholders of the bank.</p>
<p>The rival list collected 5,207 votes, almost 80 percent of the total, against the 1,275 votes for Cesarini's list.  </p>
<p>Cesarini and his team helped Popolare Milano turn a 264 billion lire profit in 1996 after posting a 391 billion lire loss two years earlier. But Cesarini recently lost the support of the majority of the employees-shareholders, who through the committee choose board members on the basis of a statute of the co-operative "popolari" bank.</p>
<p>The former chairman had tried to change the bank's statute to give more weight to other shareholders, such as institutional investors, who hold about 18 percent of shares.  </p>
<p>Each of Popolare Milano's 100,000 shareholders holds a single vote, no matter how many shares each owns. That mechanism has bolstered the influence of the employee-shareholders.</p>
<p>The newly elected chairman, Paolo Bassi, who is supported by the commmittee, affirmed his faith in the co-operative model and told institutional investors that the bank's strategy would not change under his leadership.</p>
<p>With strong backing from the Bank of Italy last month to push through reforms, Cesarini had proposed the vote with the support of institutional investors, expressed yesterday by three main funds, during the meeting held in Milan.  </p>
<p>But the committee accused Cesarini and general director Giuseppe Grassano of acting without consulting them and of attempting to destroy the co-operative nature of the bank. In the end, the committee forced them to step down.</p>
<p>The bank showed positive results in the first quarter of 1997, with a 17.5 percent growth in fees and commissions, which helped offset a 8.2 percent decrease in its net interest margin, reflecting a decline in interest rates.</p>
<p>Profit before provisions edged up 0.4 percent compared with the first quarter of 1996, but the result was 44 percent better than the bank's internal budget, Cesarini told shareholders.  </p>
<p>He said deposits had risen by 3.1 percent, loans by 6.6 percent and managed funds by 65.1 percent. Total income rose 0.9 percent with fee and commission income increasing to 41.3 percent of total income from 35.5 percent.</p>
