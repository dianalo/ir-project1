<p>American Restaurant Partners LP, which operates 67 Pizza Hut restaurants, said Tuesday a same-store sales decline in the first quarter was larger than expected and its operating earnings were lower.</p>
<p>"We expected to experience same store sales declines in the first quarter because we were rolling over very good sales from the introduction of TripleDecker Pizza during the same quarter last year; however, the sales decline was more than we expected," Hal McCoy, chairman, said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The sales decline coupled with the increase in minimum wage has contributed to lower operating earnings," McCoy said.  </p>
<p>American Restaurant said it will pay a quarterly cash payout of $0.11 per Class A Income Preference Unit, payable April 25 to holders of record on April 11. The previous dividend was also $0.11 per unit.</p>
<p>"Based on the results for the first quarter, the Partnership is only able to pay the same level of distribution as we did in January," McCoy said.</p>
<p>American Restaurant operates 67 Pizza Hut restaurants in its exclusive franchise territory.</p>
