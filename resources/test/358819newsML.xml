<headline>Henderson Land attracts little buying on first day.</headline>
<dateline>TOKYO 1997-02-05</dateline>

<p>Henderson Land Development Co Ltd, only the second Asian company ever to list on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), finished its first trading day slightly lower than its inital offer price on Wednesday despite China-related shares' recent attractiveness.</p>
<p>The shares of the major property developer based in Hong Kong were first traded at 1,140 yen on Wednesday, lower than its initial offer price of HK$73.25 (about 1,161 yen).</p>
<p>Henderson's shares finished 1,140 yen, the same as the opening price, after being trapped in a narrow range of 1,100 yen to 1,150 yen throughout the day.</p>
<p>"Investors who bought at the offer price didn't want to sell at the (current) level," said a senior foreign stock broker at a major Japanese securities house.</p>
<p>But he added: "From a long-term viewpoint, Henderson's outlook is promising if the Chinese economy continues to grow, though the issue could fluctuate in the short term amid uncertainty over Hong Kong's return to China (on July 1)."</p>
<p>Henderson said last week it would issue 33 million new shares as part of a planned secondary listing in Tokyo. The first Asian issue on the TSE was by Malaysian infrastructure developer YTL Corp Bhd in February 1996.--Hiroko Nakata</p>
