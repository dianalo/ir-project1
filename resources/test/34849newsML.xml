<title>MALAYSIA: KL shares end firmer on followthrough buying.</title>
<headline>KL shares end firmer on followthrough buying.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1996-09-05</dateline>

<p>Followthrough buying from Wednesday's recovery nudged up Kuala Lumpur stocks for a second day running, but few compelling investing themes emerged to spark excitement, dealers said.</p>
<p>"It was actually quite a boring day," said Tony Shue, a vice president in institutional sales at Jupiter Securities. "There's not much corporate news."</p>
<p>The key Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index ended up 2.07 points to 1,107.49, while the Second Board tacked on a 1.23 point rise to 543.23. The index tracking second liners rose as high as 547.58 earlier in the session.  </p>
<p>Volume topped 195 million shares, with gainers leading losers 284 to 278. After recovering from the news of U.S. missile strikes on Iraq earlier this week, the market had now turned back to economic factors, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Overall, people have decided what is more important is the U.S. interest rate situation," said one institutional dealer, noting that the key U.S. monthly jobs report is due Friday.</p>
<p>Domestically, a slight ease in some banks' base lending rates provided some encouragement. But Shue said the rate cuts did not signify a change in interest rate direction and was just "an adjustment in terms of cost of funds".</p>
