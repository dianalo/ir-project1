<p>Three western European oil refineries are expected to close or cut capacity in 1997 -- the victims of Europe's oil industry battle against low downstream profitability -- but analysts expect only a long, slow recovery in margins.</p>
<p>Typical European refinery margins will grow by a meagre 25 cents per barrel in 1997 to around $1.70 per barrel, analysts estimate, well below the lowest level which pays for new investment of about $5 per barrel.</p>
<p>"Refining still doesn't look like a good business to be in," said Geoff Pyne, who monitors the oil markets for investment bank UBS.</p>
<p>With large capital costs sunk in them and closure charges prohibitive, refineries have an incentive to continue trading even in a low-profit environment.</p>
<p>Pyne sees complex European margins after variable costs increasing from $1.15-1.20 in 1996 to $1.30-1.40 per barrel next year.</p>
<p>Jeremy Hudson, oil analyst for Salomon Brothers, expects them to rise from $1.60 in northern Europe and $1.85 in the Mediterranean to $1.85 and $2.20 respectively.</p>
<p>But some oil companies are forecasting no substantial rise in margins at all.</p>
<p>Paul Skinner, a director of Shell International Petroleum, said this week: "We are not seeing any major change in refining margins... We expect the picture to remain pretty flat in the $1.50 to $2.00 range."</p>
<p>During the Gulf War in 1990/1991, European margins peaked around $3.00 per barrel, but otherwise have languished in a range of 80 cents to $2.00 per barrel since the oil price crash of 1986.</p>
<p>Skinner said continued capacity expansion, slow products demand growth and a diet of lighter crude would negate the effect of refining rationalisation.</p>
<p>UBS' Pyne was slightly more optimistic: "We expect the upgrading margin to improve slightly next year, but it looks like a long, slow recovery, and the sort of peaks we saw in 1990/1991 are nowhere on the horizon."</p>
<p>"The bottom line is there is still too much capacity being opened in the world, especially in south-east Asia," he said.</p>
<p>On Europe's refinery death row for 1997 are Kuwait Petroleum's 60,000 barrel per day (bpd) Danish refinery and Chevron's 115,000 bpd Pembroke, UK plant which are both expected to close. The Exxon /OMV Karlsruhe, Germany refinery is planning a 60,000 bpd capacity cut.</p>
<p>Also awaiting sentence are four refineries in France's Rhone Delta, owned by Total, Shell, British Petroleum and Exxon, whose fate should be announced in January.</p>
<p>Shell, which owns the 120,000 bpd Berre l'Etang refinery in the area, said this week that at least 120,000 bpd should close and is hoping to share the burden with other operators there.</p>
<p>Salomon's Hudson saw a growing list of refineries up for sale, including BP's 190,000 bpd Lavera, France refinery, Shell's 60,000 bpd Swiss plant and BETA's 190,000 bpd German Wilhelmshaven unit, but questioned whether there was a market for second-hand plant.</p>
<p>He saw some salvation in rising Asian demand growth in Asia, pointing to a $1.25 rise in simple Singapore margins to $3.20 per barrel.</p>
<p>"That is symptomatic of a catch-up in demand and absorption of new capacity and Europe will be the beneficiary of that. The import position at the margin can be just as important as a change of refining capacity in Europe," he said.</p>
<p>Further forward, Hudson saw European margins rising to $2.35-2.60 per barrel in 1998, partly because of a quickening pace of European rationalisation.</p>
<p>"We are seeing increasing competitive pressures in marketing, taking away the incentive to carry on with marginal refining capacity which was there to support profitable marketing networks," he said.</p>
<p>"In 1996 this was highlighted in the UK, but it is also occurring in Spanish gasoline and we have seen a small downwards drift in gross French margins."</p>
