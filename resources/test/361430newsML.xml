<p>The Church of Scientology on Thursday hit out at a German public opinion poll, saying it was evidence of a "hate campaign", and accused a minister of manipulating Bavarians.</p>
<p>In a statement issued from its Los Angeles headquarters, the church's president Rev. Heber Jentzsch decried the results of a survey for Bavarian television released on Wednesday as "the strongest evidence yet of the use of a hate campaign against the Church of Scientology in Germany in order to avoid the real issues that are facing Bavaria and the entire country."</p>
<p>The survey, conducted for Bavarian television, found that 59.2 percent of respondents were in favour of calling in the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution -- an anti-extremist watchdog agency -- to keep a eye on the controversial organisation.</p>
<p>Of those who had heard of the organisation, 40.6 percent favoured banning it altogether, according to the survey of 508 people carried out by the Allensbach polling group.</p>
<p>Germany and the Los Angeles-based church have been engaged in a fierce war of words over the last few months. Scientology has compared Germany's treatment of its members to Nazi persecution of the Jews before World War Two.</p>
<p>Jentzsch said: "The results show this wasn't a survey for public opinion; it is an indictment exposing government dis-information.</p>
<p>"The survey establishes that with a well-funded hate campaign politicians such as Labour Minister Norbert Bluem have been able to manipulate the opinions of the Bavarian people," he added.</p>
<p>Bavaria has been at the forefront of the fight against Scientology, excluding companies run by Scientologists from public tenders and asking applicants for public sector jobs whether they belong to the group.</p>
<p>Jentzsch said the survey "confirms the reports of intolerance discovered" by the U.N. Committee on Human Rights, the U.S. State Department and a committee of British lawmakers.</p>
<p>"Bluem and a handful of political fanatics in Germany should be condemned for their campaign to destroy human rights," said Jentzsch.</p>
<p>Germany does not accord Scientology the status of a religion, believing it to be a purely economic organisation. Officials say it exploits the insecurities of its members to make big profits from expensive self-improvement courses.</p>
