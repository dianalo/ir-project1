<text>
<p>Moody's Investors Service said on Thursday it placed the long term A3 debt rating of the Australian governments' National Rail Corp (NRC) on review for possible downgrade.  </p>
<p>Moody's said the review followed the government's recent announcement that it planned to sell its equity stake in NRC.</p>
<p>About US$220 million of debt is affected.</p>
<p>Moody's said the review was also prompted by the uncertainty regarding the future structure of the Australian rail transport industry.</p>
<p>It cited the government's decision to sell the Australian National Railways Commission (ANR), the impact upon NRC's operating environment from the uncertainty, and the risks associated with the potential for NRC to acquire or assume some of ANR's operations. - Sydney Newsroom 61-2 9373-1800</p>
