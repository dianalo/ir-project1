<p>Police fought pitched battles with protesters outside Ecuador's presidential palace on Friday after acting President Fabian Alarcon urged demonstrators to join him and take the building by force.</p>
<p>Hundreds of helmeted riot police, backed by armored personnel carriers and water cannon, fired repeated volleys of tear gas into an angry crowd of about 4,000 demonstrators as the moved to breech the security cordon around the Carondelet palace.  </p>
<p>National television said at least one youth was seriously injured in the disturbances, in which some protesters fought back with rocks and homemade gasoline bombs as dense plumes of tear gas rose up over the historic city center.</p>
<p>The demonstrators marched on the presidential palace, where ousted president Abdala Bucaram has been holded up since his destitution by Congress on Thursday, after attending a rally led by Alarcon in the nearby Plaza de San Francisco square.</p>
<p>Alarcon had urged Ecuador's military to join in his march on the palace, but police and army troops responded with force when he and his supporters sought to breech their lines.</p>
<p>Sporadic disturbances occurred all day in the colonial streets around the palace. But the clashes that erupted shortly before 6 p.m. (2300 GMT) were the worst by far and beefed up the pressure on Bucaram to hand over the presidency to Alarcon.</p>
