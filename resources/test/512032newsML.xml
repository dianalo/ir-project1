<p>An unexpectedly benign outcome for New Zealand's March quarter inflation prompted an immediate market-led easing of New Zealand monetary conditions on Tuesday, bringing them more into line with central bank aims.</p>
<p>Statistics New Zealand said CPI inflation fell 0.3 percent over the quarter -- its first such fall since 1991 -- bringing the annual number down to 1.8 percent from 2.6 in calendar 1996.</p>
<p>Only one of 14 economists polled by Reuters before the data had forecast a quarterly decline.</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) later calculated underlying inflation was running at just under 2.0 percent for the year to March, down from 2.4 percent in calendar 1996.</p>
<p>Local financial markets' reaction to the data was swift.</p>
<p>Bank bill futures rallied sharply, the June contract rising 18 basis points to 92.43 on heavy turnover of over 5,000 lots.</p>
<p>The New Zealand dollar, already undermined by a sharply lower Australian dollar, dropped about 20 basis points before finding support at around US$0.6883/90.</p>
<p>The combination gave welcome fuel to the share market, where the key index rallied just under one percent.</p>
<p>Economists said the inflation outcome supported the RBNZ's view, expressed last month, that conditions had become "inappropriately firm".</p>
<p>That comment had caught the market off guard and led to widespread scepticism that it was too optimistic.</p>
<p>"After fighting the Reserve Bank for an extended period, the market may now start to believe the bank's inflation outlook," Bankers Trust chief economist David Plank said.</p>
<p>The RBNZ, which is charged with keeping inflation within a zero to three percent band, forecast inflation at 1.2 percent for the March 1998 year and 1.1 percent in 1999.</p>
<p>"It reinforces what the Reserve Bank was saying a month ago, that we can have easier monetary conditions," ASB Bank chief economist Anthony Byett told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said if conditions do not ease further, the bank could well state that they are still too tight.</p>
<p>But economists said the challenge for the bank was not now, but in 1998 and 1999, when growth is widely expected to pick up strongly, dragging inflationary pressures with it.</p>
<p>"Inflationary pressures are going to creep up by then and 1998 is starting to come into the Reserve Bank's horizon," ASB's Byett said.</p>
<p>ANZ Bank chief economist Paul Stewart said monetary conditions were still tighter than required.</p>
<p>"But having said that, our assessment of monetary conditions is that they have probably moved back to the point where they (the RBNZ) don't necessarily feel compelled to make some sort of statement, given that they have some tolerance either side of what they require," he said.</p>
<p>Joselyn Stroombergen at WestpacTrust said the CPI was surprisingly low across many of the sub-sectors.</p>
<p>She expected to see a further steepening of the yield curve, with short rates falling further as a result of the data.</p>
<p>"As to inflation further out, I think that that long end (bond yields) will still be held up by some of the uncertainty," she added.</p>
<p>Treasurer Winston Peters on Tuesday welcomed the CPI report, which he said supported expectations of a downward trend in inflationary pressures.</p>
