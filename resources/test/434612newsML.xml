<p>The New Zealand share market closed lower on Tuesday after first rising and then falling on the back of market heavyweight Telecom New Zealand.</p>
<p>Telecom shares finished up a cent at NZ$6.53 after hitting $6.60 in early trade.</p>
<p>At the close the NZSE40 capital index had eased 5.81 points to finish on its low for the day at 2,274.26.</p>
<p>"It was best described as lacklustre," Geoff Brown, a broker with Ord Minnett, said.  </p>
<p>He said the rise and fall of Telecom shares drove the index and was the feature of the day. He said the only shares to trade in volume were Telecom, with 1.5 million crossed, and Brierley Investments, off a cent at $1.36 on trade of 4.4 million shares.</p>
<p>Fletcher Paper, which gained 13 cents on Monday, lost eight cents.</p>
<p>"The market just lacks direction really," Brown said. "It lacks any reason to go a long way from where it sits."</p>
<p>He said the earnings from recent results had disappointed and interest rates had gone higher than many expected.  </p>
<p>"Until you get one or other of those factors changing the market has no real reason to go forward.</p>
<p>He said an investment conference in Auckland may have partly explained the low volume, but the presence of international investors could be expected to boost interest as well.</p>
