<p>Vancouver City Savings Credit Union said on Tuesday that it has applied for federal approval to open the country's first totally branchless bank, early next year.</p>
<p>The new bank, Citizens Bank of Canada, will enable customers to do all their banking over the telephone, computer, television or an automated teller machine.</p>
<p>"Citizens Bank...expects to open early in 1997, but there will be no lineups, no waiting, no tellers and no branches," VanCity said in a statement. VanCity is the latest company to join the race to set up virtual banking operations in Canada.  </p>
<p>Earlier this summer, Dutch financial services giant ING Groep NV said it is planning to set up an electronic, branchless bank in Canada.</p>
<p>Last month, Trimark Financial Corp, AGF Management Ltd and Citibank Canada, a unit of Citicorp, said they also have plans to offer virtual banking services.</p>
<p>VanCity is Canada's largest credit union with nearly C$5 billion in assets and owns Citizens Trust. VanCity said it has sought federal approval to convert Citizens Trust's existing charter to national bank status.  </p>
<p>VanCity said Citizens Bank will offer a full range of banking services, including savings and chequing accounts, term deposits, mortgage lending, retirement savings plans, bill payments and ATM services.</p>
<p>Citizens Bank chief executive officer Linda Crompton said the new bank will offer customers a branchless alternative to Canada's traditional banks.</p>
<p>"We believe that over time we will change the face of banking in this country," Crompton said.</p>
