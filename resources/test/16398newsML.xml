<p>Russian and rebel military commanders in Chechnya said they had resolved their remaining differences on Tuesday and completed a ceasefire agreement brokered last week by Kremlin envoy Alexander Lebed.</p>
<p>Russian general Vyacheslav Tikhomirov told reporters in the Chechen village of Novye Atagi that a dispute over weapons seized from Russian soldiers would pose no further obstacle. Separatist chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov said both sides had pledged to avoid any further breakdown in the peace process.  </p>
<p>Tikhomirov said troops would resume pulling out of Grozny on Wednesday after halting at the weekend when a group of soldiers had their weapons taken. Withdrawal from some southern districts of Chechnya would be completed on Tuesday, he said. A final army withdrawal from the region would be the subject of new talks in the future, he added.</p>
<p>Tikhomirov said that over the next four days a system of joint Russian-Chechen police patrols would get under way in Grozny, much of it in rebel hands since an August 6 offensive. The two sides would also begin work on exchanging prisoners.</p>
<p>"There will be no more obstacles to the continuation of our task," Tikhomirov said following the final agreement on what he called the "practical implementation of the Lebed plan".</p>
<p>"We gave each other our word that no provocations would become grounds for a breakdown of negotiations," Maskhadov said. "Somehow in the end we got around to really acting on creating peace."</p>
