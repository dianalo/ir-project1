<p>About 47.1 percent of Chinese chemical firms reported a loss in the first quarter of this year, a rise of 8.65 percentage points compared with the same period last year, the Chemical Industry News said on Friday.</p>
<p>The 2,037 chemical enterprises, including 1,311 state-owned firms, reported a total of 2.197 billion yuan ($264 million) in losses, a rise of 880 million yuan from the same period of 1996, the newspaper quoted a notice issued by the Ministry of Chemical Industry as saying.</p>
<p>It attributed the loss to the rising costs of production and sales, saying sales costs increased by 15 percent.</p>
<p>The chemical industry made 3.006 billion yuan in pre-tax profits in the first quarter, a drop of 1.305 billion yuan compared with the same period of last year, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Industrial output reached 16.795 billion yuan in the first three months, up 1.36 percent from the same period of 1996 while sales revenue of chemical products hit 59.971 billion yuan, up 2.0 percent, it said but gave no further details.</p>
