<p>"Wacky." "Unbelievable."</p>
<p>Options traders and analysts are increasingly using adjectives like these to describe the market's daily gyrations, and Friday was no exception.</p>
<p>By 1345 CDT/1845 GMT Friday, the Dow industrial average was up about 20 points at 7,156. It had fallen to 7,094 and rallied to 7,196, an intraday range of about 100 points.</p>
<p>From Monday to Wednesday, the blue chip measure finished up 143 points, up 11 points and down 140 points. On Thursday it fell 30 points, then rallied 130, only to close up 51 points.  </p>
<p>"This type of behavior is more and more common," said Jerry Hegarty, an analyst at Thomson Financial. "Each month we see new events that are occurring for the first time."</p>
<p>He said in a report that traders need to focus on strategies and avoid letting emotions get the best of them.</p>
<p>One options trader who deals in major index options said he has been able to manage the market's volatility because his time horizon is so short.</p>
<p>"But from an investor standing outside looking in, I've never seen anything like this," he said. "It's zoo-ey."  </p>
<p>Trading in options on the S&amp;P 100 index .OEX, S&amp;P 500 index .SPX and Nasdaq 100 index .NDX was delayed for about 10 minutes after June S&amp;P 500 futures rose their opening seven-point trading limit.</p>
<p>By afternoon, put and call volume in both the OEX and SPX were about even, and traders said premiums were relatively stable compared to recent movement.</p>
<p>"It doesn't pay to be short premium and it doesn't pay to be long premium," the options index trader said.</p>
<p>In the OEX, the heaviest action was in the May 800 puts, which traded nearly 10,000 contracts.  </p>
<p>The option was down 2-7/8 at 5-5/8.</p>
<p>The May 810 call was the most active OEX call, with turnover of 8,050 contracts. The option rose 3/4 to 5-1/2.</p>
<p>The OEX was up 4.23 at 807.56 after falling to 798.65 and rising to 810.21.</p>
<p>June S&amp;P 500 futures were ahead 4.95 points at 827.50. They rallied up to 832.50 before easing back.</p>
<p>Earlier, one firm pegged fair value at 3.45 points premium to cash. Buy programs were expected at a 4.60-point premium and sell programs at a 2.55-point premium.</p>
<p>The spot SPX was up half a point at 824.30.  </p>
<p>The most active SPX option was the June 820 put, which traded about 6,640 contracts.</p>
<p>Other actives included the May 400 and June 400 calls, which traded 3,200 and 4,900 contracts, respectively.</p>
<p>The May 400 calls, which expire next week, traded at prices ranging from 427 to 419-7/8. Most of the trades were on the sell side. Open interest was 3,436.</p>
<p>The June 400 calls traded between 427-3/4 and 419-7/8. Some of that activity was from spreads also. Open interest was 3,454.</p>
