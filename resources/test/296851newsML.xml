<p>Indian Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said on Thursday that the government was ready to cut taxes if there was an increase in the number of taxpayers.</p>
<p>"If the tax base grows as much as I like and expect it to grow, you will find in response a reduction in tax rates," Chidambaram told an international business conference in Calcutta.</p>
<p>India, with an estimated population of 930 million, has a burgeoning middle class whose size is variously estimated between 150 and 400 million. But the number of taxpayers in India is considered low at 14 million.</p>
<p>Chidambaram said the tax base must widen if India was to meet a challenge of reducing the fiscal deficit. India aims to cut fiscal deficit, which was 5.9 percent in 1995/96 (April-March) to 3-4 percent over the next few years.</p>
<p>The finance minister, considered a free market radical, is scheduled to present the federal budget for 1997/98 at the end of February.</p>
<p>Industrialists want Chidambaram to slash corporate tax, particularly a minimum tax he imposed last year on firms that earlier avoided corporate tax by using a legal loophole offering exemptions on profits ploughed back into business.</p>
<p>The Harvard-educated minister, who took over as finance minister under Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda's centre-left coalition in June, said the federal government could not tax farmers, as agriculture came was a state government subject under the Indian constitution.</p>
<p>He said controlling unproductive government expenditure to rein in the fiscal deficit was also not easy, since defence spending, interest payments on government loans, and salaries paid to state workers came under the head, and gave little elbow room to cut spending.</p>
<p>The government was keen to increase tax revenue not by raising rates but by better compliance to taxation, Chidambaram said.</p>
<p>"We are examining other (new) methods of bringing in more people into the tax net," he said.</p>
