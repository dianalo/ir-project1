<p>Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has arrived in China's southern city of Shenzhen at the start of a three-day visit to boost economic ties between the two nations, Russian officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin would visit factories in booming Shenzhen, site of some of China's most ambitious economic reforms, and meet Guangdong provincial officials before flying to Beijing in the evening, a Russian embassy spokesman said.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin is scheduled to meet his Chinese counterpart Li Peng on Friday and the two are expected to sign a multi-billion dollar oil and natural gas pact, diplomats have said.</p>
<p>The two leaders are also to sign a railroad agreement that aims to improve rail freight between the two neighbours, the diplomats said.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin's visit has been preceded by a trip by several economic and energy officials, including First Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov and Minister of Foreign Trade Mikhail Fradkov, who have been hammering out details of the deals.</p>
<p>Nemtsov is to visit the site of the Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze River on Thursday after Premier Li suddenly invited him to visit the giant hydroelectric and water conservancy project, a Russian embassy spokesman said earlier but gave no details.</p>
<p>A Russian consortium is bidding for a big contract to supply 14 generators with a total installed capacity of 9,800 megawatts for the hydroelectric power station.</p>
<p>The China Yangtze Three Gorges Development Corp has said it was still reviewing tenders from several consortia to supply the generating units and had planned to select the winning bidder by late June or early July.</p>
<p>Diplomats said Chernomyrdin's visit is aimed at boosting lagging economic ties with China after a series of high-level official exchanges have bolstered political relations between Moscow and Beijing.</p>
