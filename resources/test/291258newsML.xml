<p>Speaker Newt Gingrich on Tuesday apologized to fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives for ethical lapses as he sought support before a vote on his re-election, a House member who attended a closed party meeting said.</p>
<p>Rep. Pete King of New York, asked whether Gingrich apologized at the Republican House meeting, told reporters: "He apologized for making the mistakes he did." King said Gingrich conceded that "as a leader he shouldn't have made those mistakes and thereby put the party in this position."  </p>
<p>King said Gingrich had not explicitly apologized when he addressed House Republicans for more than three hours on Monday night but told the group on Tuesday he believed an apology had been implicit in what he said.</p>
<p>Tom Delay of Texas, the deputy majority leader, also said Gingrich apologized to his Republican colleagues. "He's very contrite," Delay told reporters.</p>
<p>King, who called on Gingrich to step aside prior to his nomination by Republicans in November, said however that he would vote for the speaker on Tuesday. He said Gingrich told Tuesday's meeting he did not want a small group of Republicans to hold the House Republican majority "hostage".</p>
<p>At least five Republicans have publicly said they will not back Gingrich in the vote, scheduled for Tuesday afternoon shortly after the House convenes at the start of the 105th Congress. Gingrich has admitted he brought discredit to the House by not doing enough to prevent the use of tax-exempt donations in a partisan political activity.</p>
