<p>Chris Gratton and Dino Ciccarelli scored in the first period and Rick Tabaracci made it stand up as the Tampa Bay Lightning, desperate to reach the playoffs, beat the New York Islanders 3-2 Saturday.</p>
<p>The Lightning have 69 points, two fewer than Hartford and Ottawa, which are tied for the eighth and final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference. The Islanders have 68 points and are tied with idle Washington one behind Tampa.</p>
<p>"We probably played as desperate as we could play," Lightning coach Terry Crisp said.</p>
<p>Niklas Andersson got the Islanders back within a goal 62 seconds after Ciccarelli's goal but Shawn Burr scored a spectacular goal with 5:14 left in the second period.</p>
<p>Burr, with a defender draped on his back, drove into the circle and spun around, swatting the puck through Tommy Salo's pads in one motion</p>
<p>"We had to win, that's all there is to it," Burr said.</p>
<p>Zigmund Palffy scored for the Isles in the third period.</p>
<p>In Edmonton, former Oiler Martin Gelinas had a pair of goals, including the tying tally with two seconds left in regulation, as the Vancouver Canucks rallied for a 2-2 draw.</p>
<p>Gelinas, who was once traded for Wayne Gretzky, scored his 31st goal in the first period and drew the Canucks even by redirecting Adrian Aucoin's shot between the pads of goaltender Curtis Jospeh in the final seconds.</p>
<p>Doug Weight scored his 100th career goal and Ryan Smyth also tallied for Edmonton.</p>
<p>Both teams had great chances to score in the final 62 seconds of overtime, but Joseph and Canucks goaltender Kirk McLean stonewalled attempts at the game-winning goal.</p>
<p>Edmonton moved into a tie with Phoenix for the fifth playoff spot in the Western Conference. Vancouver is four points back of Chicago for the eighth and final spot.</p>
<p>In Boston, Ray Bourque's power-play goal 4:06 into the third period was the game-winner and Jean-Yves Roy scored twice as the Bruins broke a season-high seven-game losing streak with a 4-2 victory over the Florida Panthers.</p>
<p>The Bruins, who will miss the playoffs for the first time in 30 years, extended the Panthers' winless slide to five games (0-4-1).</p>
<p>Boston averted its first eight-game losing slide since 1955-56, the second-longest in team history. The club record of 11 was set in the Boston's first season, 1923-24.</p>
<p>Florida is just two points ahead of the Rangers and Penguins for fourth place in the East, a spot worth home-ice advantage for at least one round of the playoffs.</p>
<p>In Montreal, Kent Manderville and former Canadien Chris Murray each had a goal and an assist and Sean Burke stopped 31 shots as the Hartford Whalers moved into a tie for the final Eastern playoff spot by shutting down Montreal, 4-1.</p>
<p>Glen Wesley and Keith Primeau also scored for the Whalers, who are tied with Ottawa for eighth place in the East with 71 points. Both teams have four games remaining, including a head-to-head battle in Ottawa on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Whalers and Senators are one point behind seventh-place Montreal.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Petr Nedved had a pair of goals and Mario Lemieux added his 49th as the Penguins snapped the Ottawa Senators' franchise-record four-game winning streak 5-2.</p>
<p>The Penguins extended their unbeaten streak to four games (3-0-1) and moved into a tie with the Rangers.</p>
<p>The Senators lost for only the second time in nine games (6-2-1).</p>
<p>In Toronto, Mike Knuble and Mathieu Dandenault scored 28 seconds apart midway through the first period to lead the Detroit Red Wings past the Maple Leafs 4-2, snapping their longtime rivals' season-high five-game unbeaten streak.</p>
<p>It was the first career point for Knuble and just the third goal of the season for Dandenault.</p>
<p>Steve Yzerman and Vyacheslav Kozlov also scored for the Red Wings, who snapped a three-game winless string.</p>
<p>Detroit's Chris Osgood had 21 saves to improve to 8-2-3 lifetime against Toronto.</p>
<p>Wendel Clark had his 29th goal and Mats Sundin reached the 40-goal plateau for the second time in his career.</p>
<p>Toronto, which was enjoying its longest unbeaten stretch since November 1995, is 1-8-2 in its last 11 meetings with the Red Wings.</p>
<p>At Los Angeles, Mike Modano scored his second goal of the game with 12 seconds left in the second period to lift the Dallas Stars into a 3-3 tie with the Kings, whose latest winless streak reached six games.</p>
<p>Modano also had a chance to put Dallas ahead during a two-man advantage early in the third period, but fired wide of an open net.</p>
<p>Dave Reid had the other goal for the Stars, who climbed within two points of idle Colorado for the top seed in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>Aki Berg scored his second goal in as many games and set up another for Los Angeles.</p>
