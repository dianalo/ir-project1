<p>The European Parliament, flexing new investigative powers, interrogated the European Union's farm chief and Britain's chief veterinary officer on Tuesday to try to determine what went wrong in fighting mad cow disease.</p>
<p>EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler reiterated that it was up to member states to implement measures to stamp out the disease, known medically as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), and that stronger sanctions should be considered.</p>
<p>British chief veterinary officer Keith Meldrum, while admitting failings, notably in controls of animal rendering and feed plants, said tough corrective action had since been taken.</p>
<p>Fischler told a 19-member committee that scientists believed measures taken by Britain and the European Commission to combat the disease, which has ravaged British herds for the past 10 years, were right but had not been correctly applied.</p>
<p>"We do not have any powers of direct enforcement," Fischler told the hearing. "We should perhaps consider whether we need additional sanctioning mechanisms."</p>
<p>Fischer said that in order to help make controls more independent and more efficient he had proposed setting up a separate veterinary inspection agency.</p>
<p>"But, as is already becoming clear, the member states are showing little interest in reinforcing controls," he added.</p>
<p>The start of Fischler's public hearing was delayed by 1 1/2 hours as members of the European Parliament questioned him in private about a secret report criticising the Commission's handling of the BSE crisis.</p>
<p>The MPs first had to sign a pledge not to leak the report, which calls for a major shake-up of the Commission's veterinary services.</p>
<p>One British member of the committee said that it was a rough session, complaining that Fischler did not give satisfactory answers.</p>
<p>"The record of DG VI (agriculture directorate) over many years has not been very good," British socialist Philip Whitehead told reporters.</p>
<p>Meldrum, who heads Britain's 1,000 strong state veterinary service, said that Britain had first introduced animal feed controls in 1988 and they had since been tightened up where necessary.</p>
<p>Britain discovered in 1987 that consumption of contaminated animal feed was the cause of BSE, Meldrum said, adding that a 1988 ban on meat and bone meal in cattle feed had been remarkably effective in halting the epidemic.</p>
<p>But he admitted shortcomings.</p>
<p>"It is true that there have been failings in the animal health controls and I fully accept that we could have done better in our controls at rendering plants and feed mills," Meldrum told the inquiry.</p>
<p>Britain has taken corrective steps, including extending the meat and bone meal ban to pigs, poultry and all farm animals in March 1996.</p>
<p>Meldrum said there had been no secrecy about the problem and that Britain had not conspired to minimise the health risks.</p>
<p>"These allegations are completely untrue," he stressed.</p>
<p>The committee's report, the first to be completed under new powers in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty, is due in February 1997.</p>
