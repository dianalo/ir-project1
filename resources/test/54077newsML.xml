<p>China issued a stinging attack on Japan on Saturday, accusing Tokyo of conniving with rightwingers who have built a lighthouse on a group of disputed East China Sea islands and describing ties as distressed.</p>
<p>"It is incomprehensible that the Japanese government has taken no effective measures to prohibit such activities," said a commentary carried in the Communist Party mouthpiece, the People's Daily.</p>
<p>"Instead, it has taken a laissez-faire attitude and even connived at these activities, which have damaged Sino-Japanese friendship," it said.</p>
<p>A simmering dispute over the islands, flared in July after a rightist Japanese group built a lighthouse on one of the uninhabited but potentially resource-rich islands, known in Chinese as the Diaoyus and in Japanese as the Senkakus.</p>
<p>"The Japanese government should ban such activities to reverse the adverse impact they have produced," the People's Daily said.</p>
<p>"The acts, which defy China's solemn and just representations, cannot but arouse the indignation of the Chinese people," the People's Daily said. The islands are claimed by Beijing, Tokyo and Taipei.</p>
<p>Outrage over Japan's refusal to tear down the Diaoyu lighthouse has united nationalist sentiment in Beijing as well as in its arch-rival Taiwan. Even democratic activists in Hong Kong have joined calls for tough action by China.</p>
<p>The People's Daily criticised remarks by a Japanese official that Tokyo's decision to send warships or planes to patrol the islands was not linked to the territorial dispute so long as Tokyo exercised effective jurisdiction over the islands.</p>
<p>"These erroneous and irresponsible words not only violate previous understandings between the two countries, but also bolster and encourage the right-wingers who are intentionally provoking China," the People's Daily said.</p>
<p>"This has led to the now distressing position of Sino-Japanese relations, which was quite clearly started unilaterally by Japan," it said.</p>
<p>The row over the islands intensified this week after Tokyo effectively supported the rightists by sending patrol ships to repel private Taiwan vessels that tried to approach the islands.</p>
<p>Japanese rightists sailed to the islands and repaired the makeshift aluminium lighthouse, which was damaged by a typhoon last month, touching off anti-Japanese protests in Chinese communities in Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan and mainland China.</p>
<p>The People's Daily warned that the row could jeopardise the hard-won friendship between Japan and China, where many remember the brutal invasion in the 1930s and 1940s by Japan's Imperial Army when millions of Chinese were killed.</p>
<p>"Sino-Japanese friendship has not come easily and embodies the efforts of several generations of Chinese and Japanese," the newspaper said. "It should be cherished and safeguarded by both sides.</p>
<p>"Any attempts to lead Sino-Japanese relations astray will do neither side any good," it said. "People wonder whether the illegal activities of the Japanese rightwingers have the government's tacit support and whether there are ulterior motives for stirring up these incidents."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Beijing lodged a strong protest with Tokyo and called in its charge d'affaires in Beijing, warning of serious damage to bilateral ties if Japan failed to stop its rightists from setting foot on the islands.</p>
<p>China and Taiwan, rivals since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, agree the islands have been China's for centuries and dispute Tokyo's claim, which dates to China's forced cession of Taiwan and the Diaoyus after its defeat by Japan in 1895.</p>
