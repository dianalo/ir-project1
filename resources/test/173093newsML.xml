<p>The New York Cotton Exchange said it was fully aware of what some concerned traders described as the unprecedented open interest in spot month frozen orange juice contracts on the eve of expiry Friday.</p>
<p>"I can assure you that we are on top of the situation as we are with every expiry," said William O'Brien, NYCE's director of market surveillace.</p>
<p>He was in regular contact with those who held the November positions.</p>
<p>At 1157 EST November was up 0.55 cent at 112.50 cents per pound, with January up 0.80 cent at 99.55 cents.</p>
<p>The November to January premium widened to more than 13 cents Wednesday.</p>
<p>At close of trade on Wednesday, open interest in November was 4,408 contracts.</p>
<p>O'Brien said the number of FCOJ outstanding shipping certificates were 234 contracts, but added this did not necessarily represent the total amount of FCOJ available for delivery, details of which he declined to give.</p>
<p>Trading activity was thin as floor traders said they were closely watching the FCOJ spot November contract for an orderly expiry Friday.</p>
<p>"It's scary - I don't know what to think. There should not be that much contract open interest, especially when there are no delivery notices," a NYCE floor source said earlier.</p>
<p>"Traders are concerned about this, understandably," said analyst Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber. "This is what's holding the market up."</p>
<p>Dean Witter's Celeste Georgakis said there was not a great deal of concern about the November contract. "It's felt that it's in strong hands, but until the last minute you just don't know what's going to happen.</p>
<p>"The fact that we are reflecting tightness nearby is pulling up the back months," Georgakis added.</p>
<p>O'Brien declined to comment on the open interest and November premium over  most-active January.</p>
<p>O'Brien added, "It appears that the long position holders either anticipate the market to go higher and will liquidate, or want the spot juice delivered to them."</p>
