<text>
<p>Shares in Air Liquide largely outperformed the Paris Bourse on Tuesday on the back of bullish comments during an analysts' meeting, fund managers said. Air Liquide closed up 3.53 percent at 910 francs, while the blue-chip index ended 0.96 percent higher.</p>
<p>At least two brokerages have increased their recommendation. ABN Amro went to buy from neutral while Dupont Denant also went to A1 -- which means buy -- from A2, or neutral.</p>
<p>Analysts particularly liked the company's forecast for double-digit growth in operating profit this year and pre-exceptional earnings per share over a two- to five-year period.</p>
