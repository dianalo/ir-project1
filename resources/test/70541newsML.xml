<p>For a week, the pending nuptials of John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette were a whispered, well-kept secret in this natural paradise off the south Georgia coast.</p>
<p>With the sure knowledge that a pre-wedding leak would have created an unprecedented media frenzy on the remote island, the Kennedy clan and the people of south Georgia managed to pull off the top-secret wedding with a minimum of fuss.</p>
<p>"I think it speaks well for the people of Cumberland Island and St. Marys. We did respect their privacy," said Janet Brinko, St. Marys director of tourism.</p>
<p>The hush-hush production was known to some St. Marys townspeople a week before, Brinko said. The marriage license was issued last Thursday and the inn where the reception took place prepared for the event for days.</p>
<p>Yet Saturday's wedding, at a tiny chapel on the north end of an 18-mile (30 km) long barrier island accessible only by boat or plane, was pulled off with a sense of privacy rarely accorded America's most famous family. "The people here are nice enough that they felt they would like to treat people as they would like to be treated," Brinko said.</p>
<p>Life was far from normal on Monday on this exclusive island playground once largely owned by the Carnegie family as paparazzi cruised by land and by sea for pictures of the place where America's most eligible bachelor met his match.</p>
<p>Cumberland Island, graced by ancient oaks and miles of pristine shoreline, is home to small herds of wild horses and once was fortified by the British to prevent Spanish incursion into the coastal waters of Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina. Its sandy terrain features the ruins of both slave cabins and a 19th-century mansion.</p>
<p>The wedding service was performed at the African Baptist Church, a white, wood-framed church started by former slaves at the remote north end of the island.</p>
<p>"It's very simple. I'm surprised they used it," said Zachary Kirkland, a park ranger at Cumberland Island National Seashore, which owns the church. "It's just one room with wooden benches."</p>
<p>The intimate reception for the newly wed couple was held at the 96-year-old Greyfield Inn, an exclusive bed and breakfast in one of the Carnegies' former mansions. The inn, which like 20 percent of Cumberland Island is still owned by the Carnegie family, is not usually open to the public.</p>
<p>The groundsman who kept reporters away from its neatly manicured grounds could not hide signs of strain among staff members after a weekend spent ensuring the happiness of VIPs.</p>
<p>"We are all just gulping down the Advil now," quipped Karen Langshaw, the inn's office manager.</p>
<p>The exclusive resort issued a brief statement on Monday saying only that it had been honoured and delighted to be a part of the wedding.</p>
<p>When asked why details of the ceremony and reception were not available, Langshaw explained: "We've decided that we'll let the Kennedys handle that like most normal couples, which is what they are trying to be."</p>
<p>Camden County Judge Martin Gillette issued a marriage license for the couple last Thursday but it had not yet been returned to confirm the ceremony took place, an official in his office said.</p>
<p>By Monday, the Kennedys were long gone. But the paparazzi sniffed around for any sign of their weekend presence.</p>
