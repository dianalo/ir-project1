<p>Japan's bid to take on a global leadership role in efforts to control greenhouse gases has been met with cynicism among environmental groups back home.</p>
<p>"I have doubts whether Japan can really become a leader in these issues," said Yurika Ayukawa of the Japan branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature. "It can't even set its own target to reduce carbon dioxide emissions."</p>
<p>On Monday, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto sought to play the role of mediator in setting targets for cutting heat-trapping pollution and pledged to make a success of a global warming conference in the western Japan city of Kyoto in December.</p>
<p>Hashimoto, in a speech at the "Earth Summit Plus Five" at the United Nations, also proposed medium-term measures such as offering environment-related foreign aid and exchanging technology information with other nations.</p>
<p>But Japan failed to propose its own numerical target to curb greenhouse gases, which will be the key theme in Kyoto and was a topic of hot debate at last week's Denver summit of the Group of Seven industrialised countries.</p>
<p>Instead, Hashimoto hailed the Denver summit communique, which said the participants wanted "meaningful, realistic and equitable" targets for curbing greenhouse gases by 2010.</p>
<p>"Japan only appears to be trying to please the United States," Ayukawa said.</p>
<p>The European Union proposed a 15 percent reduction in emissions below the 1990 level, to be achieved by 2010.</p>
<p>But the United States, which accounts for nearly one-fourth of all emitted greenhouse gases, rejected European demands to set specific targets.</p>
<p>Japan accounts for roughly five percent of the world's greenhouse gases, and the nation's carbon dioxide emissions climbed to a record high of 332 million tonnes in fiscal 1995, an 8.3 percent increase from 1990.</p>
<p>"Hashimoto's speech was all rhetoric and no content. He sounds more like a mouthpiece of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)," said Yasuko Matsumoto of Greenpeace Japan.</p>
<p>Japan's powerful MITI and the industries it represents have been reluctant to consider strong measures to curb carbon dioxide emissions, such as setting targets and implementing "environment taxes".</p>
<p>"Hashimoto is talking only about vague medium- and long-term projects. Merely promising to start reduction by 2010 is too late," Matsumoto said.</p>
<p>Environment groups have targeted Japan on a host of other issues for its reluctance to put the environment before economic interests.</p>
<p>Japan's ambitious nuclear policy has suffered a setback after a cover-up of events that caused an explosion at a nuclear fuel reprocessing plant in March in Tokaimura, just 120 km (75 miles) from Tokyo.</p>
<p>The accident exposed 37 workers to low levels of radiation and was Japan's worst nuclear accident.</p>
<p>Rare coral reefs in southern Japan face destruction because of a government project to build an airport on the island of Ishikagijima in the East China Sea.</p>
<p>In April, authorities closed off the country's largest tidal wetland at Isahaya Bay in Kyushu, southern Japan, as part of a public works project.</p>
<p>In light of this, Matsumoto of Greenpeace doubted that Japan could persuade the Kyoto conference to agree on a numerical target for reducing greenhouse gases.</p>
<p>"The success of that meeting hinges on whether it can agree on specific measures to achieve early reduction of the gases. But Japan defines success as a condition where everyone is happy, which would be impossible for a conference like this," said Matsumoto.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hashimoto has already indicated, in a meeting with Australian Prime Minister John Howard in April, that he "understood" Australia's position and pledged not to turn the Kyoto conference into a "forum of confrontation".</p>
<p>Australia relies heavily on coal and is against any target, saying it would cause economic damage.</p>
<p>"The Japanese style of trying to please everybody will not lead the Kyoto conference to success," Matsumoto said.</p>
