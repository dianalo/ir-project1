<p>Hong Kong yacht Exile overtook German maxi Morning Glory on Friday to lead the fleet on the second day of the 52nd Sydney-to-Hobart race, observers said.</p>
<p>Australian Broadcasting Corp radio reported that Exile, a pocket maxi owned by expatriate Australian yachtsman Warwick Miller, was about three nautical miles ahead of Morning Glory with both yachts off Merimbula on the far south coast of New South Wales.</p>
<p>Exile, which lost two hours after being forced to restart on Thursday, staged a remarkable recovery in rough seas overnight to be second behind Morning Glory on Friday morning's scheduled radio position report.</p>
<p>"The duel which is emerging between Morning Glory and Exile is not only for line honours but also for handicap," race spokesman Peter Campbell said.</p>
<p>Thursday's heavy winds had abated to around 20 to 25 knots from the south, favouring Exile ahead of an expected northerly change.</p>
