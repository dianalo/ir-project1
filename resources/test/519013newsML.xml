<title>INDONESIA: Indonesian rupiah weakens on dollar short-covering.</title>

<p>The Indonesian rupiah weakened against the dollar in late trading on Thursday following some short-covering in the U.S. currency, dealers said.</p>
<p>"I think it's mainly short-covering which is driving the dollar higher. We haven't heard anythin yet in the market," one currency dealer in Singapore said, adding some dollar buying at the London opening helped push the rate up further.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah fell to 2,412.0/12.5 at 0840 GMT from an opening of 2,407.75/08.75. Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,411.75/12.25 and 2,407.75/08.50, respectively.  </p>
<p>Dealers said the sudden dollar upturn was not linked to a small protest by supporters of ousted minority party leader Megawati Sukarnoputri as there was no violence.</p>
<p>About 100 supporters of Megawati marched one km from the office of her chief lawyer to the Central Jakarta State Court to lodge a lawsuit against her ouster.</p>
<p>One local bank dealer said excess rupiah supply in the afternoon seemed to have aided increased dollar buying.</p>
<p>Overnight money dropped to seven percent from 14.0 percent at the opening.  </p>
<p>"Operators tend to go slightly long over the extended weekend. They just want to play safe," the dealer said. The market will be closed on Friday for a public holiday.</p>
<p>He said short-covering by both local and foreign players boosted the dollar and sustained a bullish dollar tone.</p>
<p>"Sentiment now appears to be bullish on the dollar. It might proceed until the election," another said. Indonesia will hold general elections on May 29.</p>
<p>Dealers were cautious in the morning, one day after a new bank reserve requirement rate of five percent was made effective.  </p>
<p>But the market appeared to be flush on ample central bank supply and on adequate anticipation by banks. The central bank announced the new requirement last year.</p>
<p>Tom/next swap was at 0.20/0.23, down from 0.28/0.33.</p>
<p>Dalers said swap rates edged up slightly in the afternoon.</p>
<p>One-month swaps were at 11.50/11.75, two at 24.0/25.0, three at 35.5/36.5 and six at 71.5/72.5 points.</p>
<p>Bank Indonesia raised its intervention band by one point to 2,402/2,594 and the conversion band to 2,402/2,450 on Thursday.</p>
