<p>Italy's Treasury and Budget Minister, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, rebuffed French President Jacques Chirac Tuesday for saying that Italy was unlikely to be among the first countries to join European Monetary Union.</p>
<p>In a statement, Ciampi said the Maastricht Treaty sets out clear terms for everyone and that no single country had the right to pass judgment on others.</p>
<p>"Italy is committed to fulfilling the (criteria of the Maastricht) Treaty which bind us to the same conditions valid for the other countries," he said.</p>
<p>"There will be examinations and evaluations for everybody, under the rules (which are) valid for all. No one can pretend to have an examiner's licence, and much less that of unique examiner, or believe to have already passed the exam. This is valid for Italy and it is valid for all", Ciampi said.</p>
<p>Earlier, Chirac said he doubted Italy could meet the Maastricht criteria for entering the ERM and that the lira's fluctuations are incompatible with the single European market.</p>
<p>Tuesday he said he hoped Italy would in fact be among the initial group of countries joining EMU.</p>
<p>France and Italy are to hold bilateral talks in Naples, Italy, on Thursday and Friday.</p>
