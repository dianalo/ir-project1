<p>Mitsubishi Materials Corp said on Monday it had developed concrete paving blocks that remove nitrogen oxide pollutants from the surrounding air.</p>
<p>The blocks' surface contains titanium oxide, a substance that, when hit by sunlight, undergoes a catalytic reaction that removes nitrogen oxides from the air around it, the company said.</p>
<p>It also cited experiments showing that the concrete blocks removed 80 percent of the nitrogen oxides from the air when tested in a container in a laboratory.</p>
<p>The company said 50 square metres of the paving blocks have been installed on sidewalks along a highway in Osaka Prefecture in western Japan as an experiment to evaluate the material.</p>
<p>A unit of the company will begin the manufacture and sale of the concrete blocks in January, utilising a network of franchise operations that includes 18 firms.</p>
<p>The blocks will sell for 12,000 yen per cubic metre, about the same price as high-end paving blocks, the company said.</p>
<p>The company is also studying other potential uses of the technology, such as concrete sound barriers used along major highways.  </p>
<p>The company said the pollutant-absorbing properties of the concrete would be long-lasting, as the small quantities of nitric acid that build up on the surface when nitrogen oxides are absorbed would be washed away by rainwater.</p>
