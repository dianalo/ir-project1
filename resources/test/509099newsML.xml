<p>Seventeen military police officers accused of gunning down 21 inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro's Vigario Geral shantytown in August 1993 will go on trial on Wednesday, a court official said.</p>
<p>The trial -- the first in the case -- will take place in the Rio de Janeiro state court, the official told Reuters.</p>
<p>A total of 52 police officers have been accused of involvement in the killings on the night of Aug. 30, 1993, when about 20 hooded gunmen opened fire on Vigario Geral residents to avenge the death of four policemen.</p>
<p>Those convicted face long jail terms. Two police officers were sentenced last year in an unrelated case to 309 and 261 years in jail on charges of gunning down eight street children near the Candelaria Church in downtown Rio de Janeiro in July 1993. However, under Brazilian law no prisoner may serve more than 30 years, regardless of sentence.</p>
<p>The latest trial comes as Brazil reels from fresh evidence of police brutality in the form of videotapes aired on television that show police beating, kicking and shooting at civilians.</p>
<p>A recent report by Human Rights Watch/Americas concluded police violence was rampant across Brazil and impunity was the single most important cause. The report outlined dozens of cases in which Brazilian police officers believed to have been involved in extrajudicial killings, near-fatal shootings and forced disappearances went unpunished.</p>
<p>"They (police) deal violently with suspects because they know they won't be punished," James Cavallaro, Human Rights Watch/Americas' representative in Brazil, said. "They are poorly trained, underpaid and often encouraged to be violent."</p>
