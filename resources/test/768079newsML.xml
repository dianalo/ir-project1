<p>French retailer Carrefour declined on Wednesday to say whether it planned to increase its stake in the holding company which controls hypermarkets firm Cora after winning clearance for a 42.4 percent holding.</p>
<p>A spokesman said the company had no comment on its intentions regarding Cora but was pleased by the Economy Ministry's announcement on Tuesday that Carrefour's holding in the GMB holding group did not violate competition rules.</p>
<p>Carrefour recently increased its stake in GMB to 42.4 percent from 41.4 percent acquired last year from members of the Bouriez family which controls the holding.</p>
<p>Its inroads have been interpreted by analysts as either a creeping takeover or an effort to forestall a takeover of Cora by a rival in the context of European retail industry consolidation.</p>
<p>Cora's network of 55 stores, mostly in northeastern France and Belgium, complements Carrefour's coverage of the French market.</p>
<p>Economy Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn will monitor the situation, the ministry's statement said.</p>
