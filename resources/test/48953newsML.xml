<p>A team of war crimes investigators on Thursday opened a mass grave they believe will provide evidence to convict Serbs accused of massacring thousands of Moslems from the enclave of Srebrenica.</p>
<p>The team, led by Dr William Haglund, found piles of human bones, skulls and clothing at the edge of a pit they estimate to be some 28 metres (yards) long by 10 metres wide.</p>
<p>The grave is in Branjevo Farm in northeastern Bosnia, near the town of Pilica, where Drazen Erdemovic confessed to participating in mass killings of Srebrenica men last year.</p>
<p>A Bosnian Croat who fought with the Bosnian Serb army, he told the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague that he helped execute Moslem men who had been captured as they fled the U.N. "safe area" of Srebrenica after the Serbs overran it last July.</p>
<p>Haglund said his team had only just begun scraping away the topsoil, but had already found a number of bodies, including one with hands bound behind its back.</p>
<p>"In the past few days we've been doing surveys and measuring, to find the ends of the grave," Haglund told Reuters Television.</p>
<p>"Judging by dimensions it looks like it's going to be very large, but it's hard to say if bodies occupy the (whole) space," he said. "One individual we can see is bound but we haven't managed to get it fully exposed."</p>
<p>The leaders widely regarded as responsible for the Srebrenica atrocities, former Bosnian Serb president Radovan Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic, are still at large.</p>
<p>Haglund said the team was breaking off its work until after this weekend's Bosnia-wide elections, which observers say could erupt into nationalist violence.</p>
