<p>Bangladesh call money rates opened up at 6.0 percent to 8.0 percent on Thursday from previous closing of 5.5-6.5 percent on liquidity shortfall, dealers said.</p>
<p>The call rates soared as the liquidity position of the banks strained after they bought Bangladesh (central) Bank bills worth 4.0 billion taka on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said the opening rates were wide but it was expected to narrow down to close at around seven to eight percent.</p>
