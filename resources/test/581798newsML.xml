<p>Shareholders in Shell Transport &amp; Trading Plc, the British arm of the Anglo-Dutch oil group, on Wednesday rejected an attempt to force Shell to pay greater attention to human rights and environmental protection.</p>
<p>Shell chairman John Jennings told the annual general meeting he had cast 316 million shares by proxy against a resolution seeking to change the company's policies out of a total of 357 million shares involved in the vote. The exact number of yes votes and abstentions was not immediately available.</p>
<p>Shell had urged shareholders to vote against the resolution, which was supported by PIRC, an influential shareholder action group.</p>
<p>About 40 protesters, including representatives of environment action group Friends of the Earth and Nigeria's Ogoniland region, gathered outside the building before the meeting began, beating drums and chanting "People not profits."</p>
<p>The Royal Dutch/Shell Group has come under increasing pressure from activists who accuse it of harming the environment and supporting Nigeria's military rulers. The group is a major oil producer in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The Anglo-Dutch company has dismissed the criticism, arguing that it has reduced emissions of greenhouse gases and is committed to human rights.</p>
