<headline>Co-op case against Regan adjourned until July.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-06-17</dateline>
<text>
<p>A court hearing of the Co-operative Wholesale Society's (CWS) private prosecution against entrepreneur Andrew Regan, due to take place on Wednesday, has been adjourned to July 3, a CWS spokesman said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The hearing has been adjourned by mutual agreement," the CWS spokesman told Reuters when asked to confirm the adjournment to the City of London Magistrates Court hearing.</p>
<p>An earlier preliminary hearing of the private case brought by the supermarkets-to-funeral parlours group against Regan -- who in April failed in a 1.2 billion pound ($2 billion) bid attempt for the CWS -- was adjourned to give the defence longer to prepare its case.</p>
<p>The CWS case against Regan, along with his business partner David Lyons, is for allegedly "aiding, abetting, counselling or procuring the theft and for handling stolen property".</p>
<p>Allan Green, a former senior executive with CWS, is accused by his former employer of theft of confidential documents.</p>
<p>Regan and Lyons have said they intend defending the case vigorously. ($ = 0.611 British Pounds)</p>
