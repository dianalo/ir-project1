<headline>Dow Jones says still mulling derivatives licensing.</headline>

<p>Dow Jones &amp; Co Inc said Wednesday it was still considering various exchanges' plans to license its Dow Jones Industrial Average for derivatives products.</p>
<p>"We've said that we're in discussions with people and we've also said...that we haven't reached any decisions about who, or indeed whether to do this," Richard Tofel, corporate communications director for Dow Jones, said in response to an inquiry.</p>
<p>"Until we reach an end to this process, we haven't made a firm decision to do this," he said.  </p>
<p>Options industry sources have said they expected an announcement from Dow Jones on the licensing issue by the end of May.</p>
<p>Tofel declined to elaborate further on the process.</p>
<p>Spokesmen for the New York Stock Exchange, American Stock Exchange, Chicago Board of Trade, Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Board Options Exchange all declined comment.</p>
<p>In early May, CBOE chairman William Brodsky told Reuters the exchange had filed a proposal to list Dow averages.</p>
<p>Options industry sources have confirmed that the AMEX has also put in a proposal to Dow Jones.  </p>
<p>The Philadelphia Stock Exchange acknowledged it was vying for options, warrants and other instruments based on the Dow 30 industrials and other Dow indices.</p>
<p>"We gave them a formal presentation and we submitted a written proposal to them, and now we're just waiting for their decision to be made," a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia exchange said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Pacific Exchange confirmed "that we put in a proposal to trade options on the Dow Jones Industrial Average."  </p>
<p>CBOT chairman Patrick Arbor said at the CBOT's annual meeting in February that the CBOT was discussing with Dow Jones developing a Dow product complex at the futures exchange.</p>
<p>"Our proposal will seek to trade not only futures on the Industrial Average but on a full complex of Dow index products which include products of foreign countries," Arbor said at the February 27 members' meeting.</p>
<p>The CBOT tried more than a decade ago to launch a futures contract based on the Dow Jones 30 industrials. That effort failed after Dow Jones &amp; Co sued the CBOT and successfully blocked the plan after a long legal battle.</p>
<p>The CME opened a futures contract January 9 based on the Dow Jones Taiwan stock index. That product is listed exclusively in after-hours electronic trading on GLOBEX.</p>
