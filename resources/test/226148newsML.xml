<p>Media group Singapore Press Holdings Ltd (SPH) said on Friday it had entered into a joint venture with Lum Chang Holdings Ltd and SC Global Investment Pte Ltd to buy Paragon shopping complex for Singapore $682.3 million from Japan's Sogo.  </p>
<p>The transaction is the largest commercial deal in Singapore in recent years. Paragon is a prime shopping complex located in the heart of Singapore's prestigious shopping belt Orchard Road.</p>
<p>Sogo had bought the Paragon and a piece of adjoining land back in 1989 for S$690 million.</p>
<p>SPH said in a statement that it would hold 75 percent of the joint venture company. Lum Chang would hold 20 percent and SCG would hold the remaining five percent.</p>
<p>Today's deal is the second property SPH and Lum Chang have bought together in two months.  </p>
<p>In September, SPH and Lum Chang bought the Promenade, located next to the Paragon in Orchard Road, for S$270.9 million.</p>
<p>"The acquisition of the property is in line with SPH's strategic initiative to diversify its core business activity to include investment in high grade properties situated in prime locations. The acquisition is a long term investment," said SPH.</p>
<p>SPH said it plans to build a 14-storey office extension above the existing Paragon complex.  </p>
<p>Analysts are divided over the move by SPH, which has a near monopoly on the newspaper business in Singapore, to move into property.</p>
<p>"I do not understand why they are buying now at the peak of the property market. They had all the cash but they only invest in property now," said an analyst who follows SPH.</p>
<p>She estimated that the SPH group has cash and near cash of about S$1.3 billion.</p>
