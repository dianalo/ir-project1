<p>The Bonn parliament on Friday gave the final go-ahead for its soldiers to join a new peacekeeping force in Bosnia, the first time German combat troops will take full part in a ground mission alongside Western allies.</p>
<p>With a large part of the opposition also in favour, parliament voted by 499 votes to 93, with 21 abstentions, to send some 3,000 German troops to join the NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR).  </p>
<p>The 18-month deployment marks the first time united Germany will send combat troops to serve on the ground in another country.</p>
<p>Bonn had about 4,000 troops in the multinational IFOR mission whose mandate is now expiring. But it limited their tasks to logistical jobs such as bridge-building and running a field hospital because of fears they might revive memories of the Nazi occupation of Yugoslavia in World War Two.</p>
<p>The new German contingent will for the first time include infantry and armoured-vehicle-based reconnaissance forces, ready and equipped to face combat situations.</p>
<p>Since World War Two, the only German combat troops to have served on the ground abroad were the communist East German forces sent to Czechoslovakia to help the Soviet army put down an anti-communist uprising in 1968.</p>
