<p>Prime Minister Zhan Videnov, under fire for his management of Bulgaria's economic crisis, has sought his party's backing to stay in office and introduce an IMF-backed currency board.</p>
<p>Senior members of the ruling Bulgarian Socialist Party met through the night to discuss calls for change after their defeat in November 3 presidential elections but have made no cabinet changes.</p>
<p>Videnov asked the party for a confidence vote to enable him to continue until January, when he plans a full party congress.</p>
<p>Influential former party chairman Alexander Lilov and other speakers called for a new cabinet with new policies but put forward no names.</p>
<p>Videnov said he supported introduction of a currency board proposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to restore confidence in the collapsing lev, and asked the party for backing to start negotiations.</p>
<p>"The country is on the verge of default on payments to our foreign creditors and we have to face the fact that a new default on payments will mean an end to Bulgaria's integration with the European economy," he said.</p>
<p>Introduction of a currency board must be approved by parliament, where the Socialists are half way through their four-year term.</p>
<p>Under the currency board system, the amount of national currency in circulation must be exactly matched by the central bank's hard currency reserves.</p>
<p>Currency boards, pegging the local currency usually to the dollar, have been used by Argentina and the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to restore confidence and help defeat hyperinflation.</p>
<p>Videnov said the system would prevent the central bank from pouring money into refinancing of collapsing banks or fuelling inflation by printing money, and would stabilise the whole economy.</p>
<p>"On the basis of that stable economic growth we think we will have favourable conditions for servicing payments to our foreign creditors," he said, adding that if Bulgaria adopted a currency board, his government would seek fresh support from international financial institutions.</p>
<p>The IMF has twice postponed a badly-needed $115 million credit due to Bulgaria's failure to meet reform targets which include curbing inflation, stabilising the exchange rate, speeding up privatisation and closing loss-making enterprises.</p>
<p>Delegates to the meeting at the Socialist party headquarters in Sofia said speakers were divided about equally between supporters and opponents of Videnov and no major government changes were expected before the party congress.</p>
<p>The meeting, which opened on Monday evening, is expected to end later on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The main opposition Union of Democratic Forces and its allies have said they will press for early general elections after their candidate Petar Stoyanov won just under 60 percent of votes in a November 3 presidential election run-off.</p>
<p>Main trade unions are discussing plans for a general strike on November 20 to protest against falling living standards.</p>
<p>The lev has collapsed from 70 to the dollar in January to 256 on Tuesday and annual inflation is forecast at 240 percent.</p>
<p>Bulgaria has overshot all its 1996 budget targets and has had to postpone drafting next year's budget because of the unpredictability of the central bank's main interest rate, which is currently 180 percent.</p>
