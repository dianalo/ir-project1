<p>Japanese Ambassador Morihisa Aoki put it best: "It has been a long but unforgettable party."</p>
<p>Aoki's unfailing good humour after heavily armed Marxist rebels burst in on a packed reception at his home in Peru's capital on Dec. 17 was one of the lighter moments which have eased the nightmare ordeal for his guests, former hostages said.</p>
<p>While Aoki wryly apologised for the "unexpected length" of his party, others joked that they would form a "Former Hostages of the Japanese Ambassador's Residence" club.</p>
<p>The fate of next year's festivities, however, was less certain.</p>
<p>"Many who had been thrilled to be invited after years of waiting joked 'This is the first and last time I come to this party'," said university professor Carlos Aquino Rodriguez, who was released on Dec. 22 with 224 others.</p>
<p>Faced with the ever-present danger of about 20 well-armed gunmen and the continuing concern that police would try to free them by force, the hostages developed strong ties and mutual support to keep their spirits high.</p>
<p>One former hostage recalled eating a sandwich prepared by a "dream team" of two former government ministers and the chef of one of Lima's top restaurants.</p>
<p>Another remembered the moment when a Japanese businessman knocked on the door and asked to be let in after spending the night outside in the garden.</p>
<p>"He had hidden when the assault and shoot-out started. It didn't occur to him to go over the wall and out onto the street," economist Francisco Sagasti, released on Dec. 20, wrote in a diary published in the weekly magazine Caretas.</p>
<p>Sagasti also recorded the moment when a leading congressman sleeping in his room announced loudly in the middle of the night that he needed to relieve himself.</p>
<p>"Instead of asking permission and going to the bathroom, he jumped between the tightly packed bodies ... grabbed a bottle, urinated into it and then left it on the bookcase as if it were a trophy," Sagasti wrote.</p>
<p>Despite the trying conditions inside the residence, hostages shared duties around the home without complaint.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela -- the rebels' prized captive -- for example, cleaned the bathrooms on the first day of the siege, freed Peruvian Foreign Ministry official Jose Carlos Mariategui said.</p>
<p>Although most were far from accustomed to doing tasks around the home, the all-male hostages took to the task of keeping the house clean with aplomb.</p>
<p>"We became quite house-proud," said Peruvian businessman Manuel Iga after his release on Dec 20.</p>
<p>Even barriers between the hostages and the captors were broken down with time.</p>
<p>Hostages in one room watched soap operas with the two teenage girls in the MRTA group and Iga said some captives even sought the autograph of rebel leader Nestor Cerpa.</p>
<p>But it was in the moments of highest tension that humour and camaraderie became the hostages best defence. When fuel ran out for the generator, throwing the home into total darkness, fears grew that a violent rescue attempt was imminent.</p>
<p>The rebels, also nervous, ordered all the hostages back to their rooms and told them to go to sleep.</p>
<p>"But it was seven o'clock. Who can sleep at seven o'clock? So we started to sing songs," said Aquino. "We must have sang about 15 songs until someone in another room shouted: 'Shut up we're trying to sleep!' But by that time our nerves had gone."</p>
