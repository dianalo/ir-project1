<headline>Zaire's Gecamines HQ to reopen Monday - official.</headline>
<dateline>LUBUMBASHI 1997-04-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>Zaire's Gecamines, which closed its head offices in Lubumbashi earlier this week fearing that civil war would engulf the city, would resume normal business on Monday, a senior manager told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>"We'll start up again on Monday without fail. As you can see there is not a single broken window," said Jean Nawej Yav, Gecamines administration and payroll director.</p>
<p>News of the office's closure on Monday in the face of advancing rebel troops underpinned a rise in the cobalt price to around $25 a pound in London this week.</p>
<p>Zairean cobalt production of some 5,000 tonnes a year accounts for roughly one fifth of global supply of the metal.  </p>
<p>"We have just had the Kolwezi operation on the radio asking for their salaries and we are getting those ready for them right now," Nawej Yav added.</p>
<p>The rebel forces of Laurent Kabila captured Lubumbashi, Zaire's second-largest city, on Thursday with remarkable ease.</p>
<p>By Friday shops were already reopening, streets were crowded and there were long lines at gas stations which had been closed during days of high tension as the rebel army advanced and the government reinforced its troops.</p>
<p>Officials said reports that there had been widespread looting by inhabitants after the rebels took the city were grossly exaggerated.</p>
<p>They said four or five shops in the centre of town had been looted, but rebel units moved quickly to stamp out the pillaging and seven people were shot dead.</p>
<p>The deputy governor of Shaba province Donatien Mwitaba, said he was confident that the copper and cobalt mining company, currently reduced to working at no more than 20 percent of capacity, could quickly be relaunched and modernised with help from foreign partners attracted by the prospect of an end to the dictatorial rule of President Mobutu Sese Seko.</p>
<p>Mwitaba said international business clearly saw rebel leader Laurent Kabila as someone they could work with.</p>
<p>"With Kabila's growing international credibility we think it will be possible to relaunch Gecamines very rapidly," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>"There are a certain number of privatisation and joint venture possibilities. There were offers already circulating, but I think now we can enlarge on these. Before, the potential partners were a bit reticent as they were doing business with a decadent regime."</p>
<p>Mwitaba said potential partners could from South Africa or the United States.</p>
<p>"We seek an opening to the south and partners in South Africa and the United States.</p>
<p>"These are the countries which have the finanical capacity to help us develop and now we will have the political stability that these partners seek. There will be a rebirth of confidence," Mwitaba said.</p>
<p>Mwitaba also said that Sizarail, a Belgian-South African consortium that runs the railway in the area, had also reopened for business.</p>
<p>The company could not be reached to confirm this.</p>
<p>Sizarail is responsible for transporting copper and cobalt from mines in Zaire's mineral-rich Shaba province, most of which Kabila's rebels have captured in their advance from the eastern border.</p>
