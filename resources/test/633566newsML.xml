<headline>Argentine official denies debt buyback plan rumors.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1997-06-03</dateline>

<p>Rumors that Argentina is planning a debt swap similar to the one in Brazil circulated in local markets Tuesday, but a government official denied such a plan</p>
<p>"There are rumors of a buyback of Brady debt and the launch of a 30-year bond," said one trader at a local bank.</p>
<p>"There is no such plan.  The rumors are circulating because Brazil is carrying out such an operation," an official from the Economy Ministry told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Another trader at a foreign bank said the rumor was a "logical consequence" of the Brazilian debt swap deal.</p>
<p>Brazil's deal allows investors to tender their par, discount or C bonds for a 30-year global bond issue or to purchase outright the new issue. The offer expires Tuesday at 1900 GMT and results are expected to be announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The second trader added that it was still only a rumor that Argentina was planning a swap.</p>
<p>"I do not think there are any offers (to carry out the deal) yet to the government," he said.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs &amp; Co and J.P. Morgan Securities are lead managing the Brazil 30-year global issue.</p>
<p>A third trader, asked about a possible Argentine debt buyback, said: "For now there is absolutely nothing."</p>
