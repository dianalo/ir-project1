<p>Tokyo rubber futures ended lower after lacklustre trade on Tuesday, as technical-driven selling dented prices following bearish sentiment from Monday, traders said.</p>
<p>Prices ranged from 2.2 yen to 3.5 yen per kg lower. Benchmark January was down 2.8 yen at 120.1 yen.</p>
<p>"After price gains last week amid a lack of fundamentally bullish factors, caution that prices were too high continued to stimulate sporadic long-liquidation," one trader said.</p>
<p>Weaker prices in producing countries on slow physical demand also dampened sentiment here, they said.</p>
