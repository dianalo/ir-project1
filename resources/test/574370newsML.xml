<p>Long-hitting Scott McCarron grabbed the outright lead at the 13th hole before pulling away to a three-stroke victory at the $1.5 million BellSouth Atlanta Classic Sunday.</p>
<p>McCarron, who started the final round tied for the lead with David Duval, carded a three-under-par 69 in brilliant sunshine on the new, highly-rated Sugarloaf course.</p>
<p>"I love this course. It suits my game and I couldn't be happier," said McCarron, who finished at 14-under 274.</p>
<p>Fellow Americans Lee Janzen (68), Brian Henninger (68) and Duval (72) tied for second on 277. It was Duval's seventh runner-up result on the PGA Tour, on which he has not won.</p>
<p>McCarron, 31, collected $270,000 for his second PGA Tour victory and jumped to 10th on this year's money list.</p>
<p>He was locked in a tight battle until he drove the green at the par-four 13th and two-putted for birdie. He went further ahead with another birdie at the par-four 15th, where he punched a wedge under a tree to seven feet, and when Duval bogeyed the 16th, it was as good as over.</p>
<p>"I hit some good drives, controlled my iron shots well, made some good putts and hit some good creative shots," said McCarron, the second longest driver on the PGA Tour this year, behind Tiger Woods.</p>
<p>McCarron, who also uses a long putter, jokingly offered part of the credit for his success to fellow pro Dicky Pride.</p>
<p>It was Pride who on Friday challenged McCarron to a race down the 11th fairway after play had been halted by bad weather.</p>
<p>Sprinting flat out, McCarron pulled his left hamstring, but he decided it was a blessing in disguise because it forced him to slow down his swing.</p>
<p>"Dicky's a character and I like having a bit of fun too," McCarron said. "I'm going to take Dicky out to dinner."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, course designer Norman made a run at the lead and closed to within one stroke before double-bogeying the par-four 17th, where he pulled a four-iron from a poor lie in a fairway bunker into an even poorer lie in deep bushes, from where he had little choice but to take a penalty stroke.</p>
<p>He birdied the last to shoot 68 and tie for fifth at 10-under 278 with, among others, his good friend Nick Price.</p>
<p>Price also was in the hunt until he double-bogeyed the final hole after pulling a nine-iron into the greenside lake.</p>
<p>"It was drawing perfectly, but the last 20 yards the ball nose-dived left," said Price, who was seeking to win two starts in a row.</p>
