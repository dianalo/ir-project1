<headline>EU grains mixed, focus remains on export rebate.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>European grains moved in all directions this week and the only common ground between markets beset by surpluses was the need for more generous rebates to speed-up the export flow.</p>
<p>French wheat firmed on a nationwide truck drivers' strike now on its third day, UK and Spanish grains were stable while German traders slashed prices further to attract buyers.</p>
<p>But the focal question in an otherwise lacklustre week for grains was how the European Union (EU) would price its wheat on Thursday and whether it would try to thwart aggressive sales by Argentina into its traditional outlets.</p>
<p>The Commission cut the refund on 256,500 tonnes of wheat exports to 15.97 Ecus a tonne last Thursday from 22.35, taking advantage of a drop in U.S. prices.</p>
<p>But French traders, enraged by the result of an Egyptian tender which favoured mainly Argentina and Australia, said the EU should track Argentine prices instead of the United States.</p>
<p>They said the EU could offer higher rebates this week to keep pace with falling world prices.</p>
<p>Rouen-delivered wheat traded at 855 francs for November from 850 last week on concerns that transports to and from ports could be disrupted by the strike.</p>
<p>French maize eased as prospects of a bumper crop turned grain co-operatives into sellers. Local crop analysts in France's southwest have revised upwards their yields estimates.</p>
<p>"We are now targeting a crop of 14.2 million tonnes," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Prices were marked down in Germany but wheat was still up to $20 a tonne more expensive than British, Danish and French origins, even after fob Baltic prices were cut by 2.50 marks this week.</p>
<p>Normal bread wheat (12 percent protein) was offered at 280-285 marks while higher quality offers were at 285-290 and 300-302 marks, depending on protein levels.</p>
<p>English feed wheat traded at a steady 100 stg a tonne in East Anglia as an apparent respite from farm selling offset the negative impact of sterling's renewed strength.</p>
<p>"I don't think this is a bullish development," said one trader. "Farmers have already sold a lot and now they are slowing down ahead of Christmas."</p>
<p>One trader said millers and compounders were not convinced of the market's inability to drop further.</p>
<p>Spanish demand for feed wheat was drying up with consumers opting for cheap French maize. This was reflected in a slight softening of ex-farm prices.</p>
<p>Demand for milling wheat, durum wheat and barley was steady, they added.</p>
<p>Maize prices were marginally firmer despite an abundance of cheap French maize as consumers preferred the better quality of Spanish maize.</p>
<p>Traders said the quality of the maize harvest had not been affected by the bad weather in Spain but harvesting had been slightly delayed in the north.</p>
<p>The harvest is now 70 percent completed in the north and 80 percent in the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in barley, German fob prices also lost five marks at the top to range between 250 and 265 marks as sales to domestic and Danish feed mixers were sluggish.</p>
<p>British barley was mostly untraded but bid at 96.50 stg in East Anglia for November deliveries.</p>
