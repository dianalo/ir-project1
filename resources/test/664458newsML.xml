<p>Austrian engineering group Schoeller Bleckmann Oilfield Equipment AG's shares sold in private placement were fixed on Monday at 840 Austrian schillings ($68.76), lead managers Investmentbank Austria said.</p>
<p>The bank estimated the offering of 500,000 shares, or 31 percent of the company's share capital, was eight- to nine-times oversubscribed.</p>
<p>Schoeller-Bleckmann issued 125,000 existing and 375,000 new shares in an offering to institutional European and U.S. investors. The shares are due to start trade on Easdaq, Europe's small cap growth market, on June 20.</p>
<p>Schoeller-Bleckmann had sales of 946.8 million schillings in 1996. First-quarter 1997 sales were 291.4 million schillings, up 33.6 percent from a year ago.</p>
<p>Current profit was 70 million schillings, up 59 percent on 1995. First-quarter current earnings were 37.5 million schillings.</p>
<p>Schoeller-Bleckmann, which makes oil drilling equipment, has been controlled since 1995 by Austria's Berndorf group. The offering will cut Berndorf's stake to around 60 percent from 75 percent, but Berndorf has said it wants to retain control for "the long term."</p>
