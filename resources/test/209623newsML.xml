<p>Britain's ambassador to Belgrade Ivor Roberts has written to the Yugoslav opposition leaders expressing "grave concern" over the results of Serbia's municipal elections.</p>
<p>The letter, faxed to Reuters early on Friday and dated November 21, was in response to an earlier letter from the three leaders of Yugoslavia's opposition Zajedno (Together) coalition.</p>
<p>"Like you, I consider the uncertainty and allegations over the results of the Serbian municipal elections a cause of grave concern," Roberts wrote.</p>
<p>The Zajedno leaders accuse the government of extensive fraud by annulling votes which gave the opposition sweeping victories in 15 of the 18 biggest towns in Serbia in the second round of polling last weekend.</p>
<p>The ruling Socialist Party conceded defeat in Belgrade and the northern town of Novi Sad, but in the industrial town of Nis turned a major defeat into victory after the local election commission ruled in their favour.</p>
<p>Some 20,000 people marched through Belgrade on Thursday, waving opposition party flags and flinging insults at Milosevic in the biggest demonstrations in the capital for three years.</p>
<p>Roberts said that the British government was following events closely, and that he hads spoken to "authorities at the highest levels" about Britain's concerns.</p>
<p>"In particular, I urged that any irregularities (for example in Nis) should be dealt with promptly and in accordance with the law. I stressed the importance of holding all elections on the basis of international democratic norms," he wrote.</p>
<p>Roberts also said he had initiated an urgent discussion of the situation within the European Union which was considering a joint statement.</p>
