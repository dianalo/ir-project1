<headline>CBOT corn ends down on nearly ideal crop weather.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-07-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>CBOT corn futures closed lower on nearly ideal crop weather in the U.S. Midwest, traders said.</p>
<p>"Corn continues to leak lower," said Dave Armstrong, analyst for ABN Amro, The Chicago Corp. "We have enough old crop and weather permitting we'll have plenty of new."</p>
<p>The U.S. corn crop is entering the key pollination or reproductive stage of development.</p>
<p>As of Sunday, the U.S. crop was three percent silked (pollinating), behind the four percent of a year ago and behind the four percent average.</p>
<p>Current weather remains conducive for crop development and there were forecasts for that weather to continue in the near term.</p>
<p>Meteorologists said cool weather and scattered showers should be common across the U.S. Midwest during the U.S. Independence Day weekend and early next week.</p>
<p>CBOT grain futures markets will be closed Friday, the U.S. Independence Day Holiday.</p>
<p>Corn was underpinned by USDA's weekly export sales report.</p>
<p>Corn closed 1/2 to 2-1/4 cents per bushel lower, with July down one at $2.44-3/4.  </p>
<p>New crop December closed 1-1/2 cents per bushel lower at $2.33-1/4.</p>
<p>USDA said during the week ended June 26, U.S. net export sales of old crop corn totalled 554,000 tonnes, above expectations for 250,000 to 350,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>USDA said net sales of new crop corn during the week ended June 26 totalled 341,500 tonnes, near the high end of expectations for 300,000 to 350,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Dean Witter sold 4.5 million bushels of December, Merrill Lynch Futures and Continental Grain sold two million December, traders said. Prudential Securities bought two million December and Cargill Investor Services bought 3.5 million bushels of December, traders said.</p>
<p>Lind Waldock spread 2.5 million bushels of July/September at 11 cents, premium July, traders said. Continental Grain spread two million December/September, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn futures volume was estimated by the CBOT at 47,000 contracts, below the 65,127 traded Wednesday.</p>
<p>In corn options, ADM Investor Services bought 1,000 December $3.00 calls at 1-1/2 cents, Tenco Inc sold 400 December $2.50 calls at six to 6-1/2 cents and sold 300 December $2.60 calls at 4-1/4 cents, traders said.</p>
<p>Corn options volume was estimated at 14,000 contracts, below the 17,421 traded Wednesday.</p>
