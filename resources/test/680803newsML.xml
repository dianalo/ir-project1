<p>The Indian government is considering imposing a "windfall tax" on oil companies as part of a package of measures to rein in the mounting cost of oil subsidies, the Economic Times said on Monday.</p>
<p>The business daily said the package being drafted by senior civil servants would gradually dismantle administered prices and phase in reductions in tariffs on crude oil imports.</p>
<p>The set of measures would aim to reconcile disparate interests within Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral's 15-party United Front coalition, which is set to consider domestic oil prices at a meeting on Friday.</p>
<p>At its last meeting on June 16, the United Front postponed a decision on whether to raise prices to plug the government's mounting debt to state oil companies, estimated at 155 billion rupees ($4.3 billion) at the end of March.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said on Saturday that the coalition could not wait much longer before deciding whether to raise domestic prices. Left-wing parties in the alliance have steadfastly opposed any increase.</p>
<p>The Economic Times said the proposed windfall tax would take effect once subsidies on petroleum products are scrapped and the firms begin to report substantial profits.</p>
<p>The daily said "it is felt that the oil companies should share a small percentage of their profits with the Finance Ministry which will be losing out on revenue following the proposed duty cuts on crude imports".</p>
<p>Tariffs on crude oil imports would be progressively reduced to levels recommended by the World Trade Organisation, it said.</p>
<p>But it quoted Finance Ministry officials as saying no tariff reductions would take place in the 1997/98 fiscal year that ends next March 31, and the tariff cuts would be staggered over five years.</p>
<p>The newspaper said that under the proposed package, the prices of domestic petroleum products would be raised by 10 to 15 percent, and the outstanding deficit on the oil pool account -- money the government owes to oil companies -- might be frozen at 155 billion rupees.</p>
<p>It said subsidies on high-speed diesel fuel and liquified petroleum gas would be phased out over two and three years, respectively. ($1 = 35.80 rupees)</p>
