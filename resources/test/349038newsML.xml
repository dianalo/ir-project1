<p>Swiss cartel authorities said they have recommended that the Swiss Cabinet force the country's telecom authority PTT Telecom to sell its interest in cable television operator Cablecom Holding AG.</p>
<p>"Telecom PTT's stake in its most important competitor, Cablecom, significantly restricts actual and potential competition in the area of local telephone networks, and thus contradicts the planned opening of the telecommunications market," the Competition Commission said.</p>
<p>"The Competition Commission thus sees sale of the stake the PTT holds in Cablecom in a competitively neutral process as indispensable," it said.</p>
<p>Telecom PTT meanwhile said in a separate statement that it would ask the Federal Ministry of Transportation and Energy, and the Swiss Cabinet to intervene in its favour.</p>
<p>The Swiss PTT has a 32 percent stake in Cablecom, which controls an estimated 50 percent of the Swiss cable television market.</p>
<p>German Veba AG and Siemens AG also hold 32 percent stakes in Cablecom through subsidiaries. The remaining four percent stake is held by Fischer Holding AG.</p>
<p>The transaction at the heart of the cartel decision dates back to June 1996, when Cablecom bought the controlling stake in a group of companies called SECE Cortaillod from Alcatel Alsthom . The group included Rediffusion, one of Switzerland's largest cable TV operators.</p>
<p>The Competitive Commission noted the purchase took place just days before revisions in Swiss antitrust laws went into effect on July 1, 1996. Under the changes, the deal would have required cartel approval.</p>
<p>The acquisition roughly doubled Cablecom's cable network to about one million subscribers, mostly in Switzerland.</p>
<p>The Competitive Commission in its decision said cable networks posed the only real potential competition to PTT Telecom's own dominance of the local telephone market, as cable services could in future be adapted to serve as two-way communication networks.</p>
<p>PTT Telecom argues, however, that there is already plenty of competition in the telecom sector, and there will be more in future due to increased use of mobile phones and satellite networks.</p>
<p>"The PTT reconfirms its opinion that its minority holding in Cablecom in no way hinders intense competition in the telecommunications sector, but rather puts resources to work in an economically sensible way and makes use of synergies," the PTT said.</p>
