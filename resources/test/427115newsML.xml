<p>French officials played down as premature a statement by Italy on Friday that a compromise deal to shelve a dispute with the United States over who controls NATO's southern command would be acceptable to France.</p>
<p>President Jacques Chirac's office declined comment on remarks by Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini and U.S. Defence Secretary William Cohen after talks in Rome.</p>
<p>The French Foreign Ministry said negotiations on boosting the European role in NATO were still going on.</p>
<p>"There's nothing new to add," one official said, referring questioners to a statement by the ministry's spokesman on Wednesday that Paris was studying proposals from Germany and the United States "with a will to reach an agreement".</p>
<p>A senior French source said Chirac would only decide in April or May, on the basis of a global package, whether sufficient progress had been made to warrant Paris rejoining the allied military structure which it quit in 1966.</p>
<p>France has urged Washington to hand over or share with the Europeans the southern command, known in NATO jargon as AFSOUTH, which controls the volatile Mediterranean region.</p>
<p>Based in the Italian port of Naples, it has always been run by an American admiral who also commands the U.S. Sixth Fleet.</p>
<p>Dini said a proposal to defer a decision on AFSOUTH for at least five years had been accepted by the rest of the alliance.</p>
<p>"We are encouraged by the fact that all other members of NATO would seem to consider this a reasonable approach to the problem," Dini told a joint news conference with Cohen.</p>
<p>"We are confident that also France may find it acceptable."</p>
<p>Italian Defence Minister Beniamino Andreatta, who met Cohen separately, said the compromise proposal had emerged from recent talks in Bonn among a number of European NATO countries.</p>
<p>Cohen said Washington considered it appropriate to defer the command issue for five, six or seven years and then review the question "without any prejudice". He called the recommendation "a very constructive proposal".</p>
<p>"We want very much for France to come in to NATO and we hope, by virtue of seeking constructive ways in which we can help bring that about, that that can become a reality," he said.</p>
<p>But a senior NATO diplomat in Paris said there would have to be other gestures to the Europeans in addition to the "neutral review" clause to make a package politically saleable in France.</p>
<p>Washington and Paris had been negotiating seriously for the last month and there were "encouraging developments", but he rated the chances of France returning to the integrated command as a little more than 50 percent.</p>
<p>Officials familiar with the talks said Washington remained hostile to rotating the command between European and American officers or splitting it by region or function, as the French have suggested.</p>
<p>"It's too early to declare victory," one French official said. "A deferral alone certainly doesn't do the trick. It could mean 'you get nothing now and we don't guarantee you'll ever get anything'," he said.</p>
