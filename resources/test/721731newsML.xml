<title>UK: FOCUS-Germany to dump oil on fragile world market.</title>
<headline>FOCUS-Germany to dump oil on fragile world market.</headline>

<p>World oil markets were looking vulnerable to further price falls as a second country lined up to sell crude on Friday, irrespective of how low prices go.</p>
<p>Crude oil prices have slumped nearly 30 percent this year and look likely to fall further when Germany joins Iraq in chasing an oil sale cash target.</p>
<p>Germany's sales, approved by a cabinet meeting in Bonn on Friday, were likely to amount to just a tenth of the volume of Iraq, but oil market nerves were already frayed and fundamentals fragile.</p>
<p>"It won't help," said Bob Finch, head of trading at Vitol SA, the world's largest independent oil trading and refining company.</p>
<p>Germany this year wants to sell $230 million worth of oil, stockpiled since the late 1970's, to help meet tough financial targets for entry to a single European currency.</p>
<p>It plans to sell 2.8 million barrels in the next few weeks and 7.3 million tonnes (or about 54 million barrels) by the end of 1999.</p>
<p>At current oil prices that would be at least 75,000 barrels per day during the rest of this year, roughly the same as a medium sized oil field in the North Sea.</p>
<p>Brent crude oil, the world benchmark, closed 11 cents higher at $18.07 thanks to a short-lived rally in the gasoline market in the Unied States.</p>
<p>But Brent remains about about $1 below levels at the start of July and traders predict further falls next week.</p>
<p>"The German move is yet another blow to an already bearish market," said John Toalster of SGST Securities.</p>
<p>"The volumes of crude from Germany are relatively small but the fundamentals are finely balanced," said Paul Spedding of Kleinwort Benson in London.</p>
<p>Iraq has moved closer to resuming oil exports under an "oil-for-food" deal with the United Nations and a meeting between U.N. and Baghdad officials on Sunday may finalise the aid plan needed before its crude sales can resume.</p>
<p>Baghdad can sell $2 billion worth of oil by December and the Iraqi oil minister said sales would resume at around 740,000 bpd.</p>
<p>The International Energy Agency confirmed the bearish mood this week saying over the rest of the year markets are "expected to soften appreciably."</p>
<p>Rising oil demand will be offset by rising oil stocks, the Petroleum Finance Company Ltd said.</p>
<p>"The final blow to prices however will be the rapid and concentrated resumption of Iraqi oil sales and the realisation of long expected North Sea output hikes," it said.</p>
<p>Leading upstream consultants Wood MacKenzie see UK North Sea oil output rising by about 300,000 bpd from the third quarter to the fourth.</p>
<p>Despite the bearish outlook towards the end of the year, some dealers believe the short term picture is more balanced.</p>
<p>North Sea output is expected to drop in August due to oil field maintenance and both Saudi Arabia and Nigeria have hiked prices to Western customers for next month.</p>
