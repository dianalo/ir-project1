<p>A top Israeli official said on Monday that state-owned defence companies had signed export contracts last year worth more than two billion dollars, up 25 percent over 1995.</p>
<p>Defence Ministry director-general Ilan Biran said he hoped the companies, burdened by years of heavy losses, would turn a profit equal to three percent of turnover next year.</p>
<p>"In 1996 we reached signed contracts worth slightly more than two billion dollars," Biran told reporters in Tel Aviv, adding that some of the contracts were multi-year deals.</p>
<p>Israel's Treasury has spent more than a billion dollars in recent years bailing out state-owned defence firms which have been buffeted by declining domestic orders and stiff competition abroad.</p>
<p>Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI), the largest of the state-owned defence companies, lost $40 million in 1996 but management projects earnings of $22 million on $1.62 billion in sales this year.</p>
<p>Biran said he hoped Israel would begin privatising IAI next year after the expiry on December 31 of a collective agreement that gives workers the right to veto any sell-off. IAI's powerful trade union has opposed privatisation efforts.</p>
<p>"For this reason we're talking about (launching privatisation in) 1998 and I hope it will materialise," Biran told reporters.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Benjamin has vowed to privatise 50 state-owned companies during his term but officials have said the defence firms would be left for last.</p>
<p>Some analysts have said obstacles to privatising the country's defence firms, including union opposition and political considerations, are too formidable for the government to surmount.</p>
