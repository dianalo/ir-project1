<p>Continental Airlines said Wednesday it suspended its advertising campaign in New York City urging the city's travelers to fly from New Jersey's Newark International Airport instead of JFK and LaGuardia airports.</p>
<p>The airline said it decided on the suspension pending a meeting with N.Y. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who objected to the campaign's slant as "disparaging of the city of New York."</p>
<p>The campaign was launched last week and Continental said New Yorkers were responding well to it.</p>
<p>Continental has used Newark as its hub since 1986. Newark is its departure point for about 350 flights a day, compared to 14 a day from LaGuardia.</p>
