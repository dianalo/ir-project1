<p>The European Commission is expected to attach further conditions to Deutsche Telekom's plan to grant price discounts to big customers, EU sources said on Thursday, but the plan will go ahead as expected on November 1.</p>
<p>The move is designed to ensure that business rivals can compete effectively with Deutsche Telekom in Germany -- Europe's largest telecoms market.</p>
<p>But although the conditions will further dent Telekom's dominant position in the German market, they are not of a nature to upset its sell-off on November 18 in the largest-ever initial public offering operation.</p>
<p>In practice, the Commission's decision will allow Telekom to go ahead with discounts of up to 35 percent to large business clients on Friday as planned while imposing conditions likely to benefit rival telecoms operators from the same date.</p>
<p>According to the EU sources, the conditions will address the issue of newcomers' right to interconnect with the established infrastructure network of Deutsche Telekom -- a highly thorny problem in all national telecoms markets previously controlled by a monopoly.</p>
<p>In a related issue, the Commission will also deal with "break-in and break-out access conditions" to Telekom's infrastructure and business networks in particular, the sources said.</p>
<p>The Commission's competition and legal departments were still discussing the exact wording of the conditions, which could be announced either later today or the beginning of next week.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom's main rivals in Germany argued to the Commission earlier this month that the tariff discounts ought to be delayed because the conditions meant to prevent it from abusing its dominant position had not been fulfilled.</p>
<p>The Commission cleared the discounts in June provided the German government granted new telecoms licences and promoted negotiations on access to Telekom's infrastructure.</p>
<p>To ensure fair competition did not remain a empty concept, the Commission would be asking Germany to make regulatory changes before the end of the year that would be retroactive to November 1, the sources told reporters.</p>
<p>"The decision is about attaching conditions that will have a retroactive effect to Nov 1...(the German government) will have to do it before the end of the year," one source said.</p>
<p>The companies that have complained to the Commission about Telekom's new pricing policy include Communications Network International, the Mannesmann unit, Thyssen subsidiary Plus Net, WorldCom Inc and Viag Interkom, the joint venture of Viag AG and British Telecommunications Plc .</p>
<p>European Competition Comissioner Karel Van Miert and German Post and Telecommunications Minister Wolfgang Boetsch have been in constant contact in the past weeks to defuse a crisis that could damage Deutsche Telekom's privatisation.</p>
