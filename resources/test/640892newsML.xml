<title>USA: High school student questioned in Levin slaying.</title>
<headline>High school student questioned in Levin slaying.</headline>

<p>A student at the high school where the murdered son of Time Warner Inc's top executive taught has been questioned about the slaying, media reports said Thursday.</p>
<p>Local radio and newspapers said police believed Jonathan Levin, 31, was murdered for his automatic teller machine card. Police sources said they thought he was jabbed with a steak knife until he revealed the personal identification number that gave access to the cash dispenser, the reports said.</p>
<p>Levin, a high-school English teacher and son of Time Warner chief executive and chairman Gerald Levin, was found Monday shot through the head in his one-bedroom Manhattan apartment. He had been bound and gagged and there was no sign of forced entry.</p>
<p>WCBS-AM radio and The New York Post said police had questioned one of Levin's former students at New York's Taft High School about the slaying. The student had left a message on Levin's telephone answering machine after the murder.</p>
<p>Taft is an inner city public high school in the poor South Bronx section of the city.</p>
<p>Detectives are checking the student's alibi. He allegedly has a criminal history, with two arrests for violent crimes, the reports said. A police spokeman said he could not comment on the report. There have been no arrests.</p>
<p>The Post and WCBS reported an ATM card was missing from Levin's wallet. Police investigators believe the killer shot Levin late Friday afternoon, raced to a Chase Manhattan Bank branch a few blocks away and withdrew $800.</p>
<p>Authorities are reviewing video tapes from the bank's security cameras to help identify a suspect.</p>
<p>Levin was buried Wednesday after an emotional funeral service that drew students from his inner-city school and some of the country's most powerful media executives.</p>
