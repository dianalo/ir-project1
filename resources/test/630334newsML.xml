<p>Opel Southeast Europe Ltd (OSE) said on Monday it questioned the accuracy of data on new car sales reported by automakers and importers in Hungary.</p>
<p>OSE, a unit of General Motors Corp's German automaker Adam Opel AG, said reports of sales totals for first-quarter this year were 35 percent above the number of new cars registrations reported by the Hungarian Ministry of Interior.</p>
<p>"We are extremely concerned about the differences (reported) in the market size -- the problem is big," Christopher Lacey, OSE's commercial director for souteast Europe, said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Automakers and importers reported selling 14,387 units, while the ministry reported 10,616 registrations, Lacey said.</p>
<p>The company with the biggest gap reported sales of 1,349 units, while the ministry reported 574 registrations, Lacey said.</p>
<p>Lacey did not identify this company, but the only one reporting this number of car sales was Ford Motor Co.</p>
<p>Ford said it had no comment but was reviewing the data.</p>
<p>The company reporting the largest sales volume of 3,123 units only had 1,962 units registered by the ministry, Lacey said.</p>
<p>These sales correspond to the volumes reported by Suzuki Motor Corp, which makes Swift hatchbacks and sedans in Hungary.</p>
<p>Opel, which has been the year-end market leader in Hungary since 1992, has been in dispute over sales data in the past with Suzuki, which has been second to Opel in sales since 1993.</p>
<p>Opel also owns roughly five percent of Suzuki, and the two companies have been negotiating jointly to design and build a mini car for Europe with production possibly in Hungary, Poland and Spain.</p>
<p>Suzuki's reported sales are ahead of Opel's reported sales of 2,166 units, but Opel's registrations of 1,999 units are the highest in the market, Lacey said without naming Suzuki.</p>
<p>"The registrations data change the market positions of the number one and the number two companies," Lacey said.</p>
<p>"We're not complaining, we're not criticising, we're big boys... but we are calling for realism," he added. "If we don't have realistic facts, people cannot make realistic decisions about the market."</p>
<p>Lacey said Opel was investigating the eight percent discrepancy in its own sales and registrations, adding that a possible explanation is that Opel has been including some of its commercial vehicle sales into its cars sales.</p>
<p>All major automakers and importers, except Suzuki, report their sales to the Hungarian Vehicle Importers Association, which consolidates the data for public release.</p>
<p>The association was not immediately available for comment.</p>
