<p>Japanese stocks closed firmer on Friday amid some profit-taking before the weekend.</p>
<p>"The Nikkei/ISE 50 index was up 4.48 points or 0.28 percent, at 1,604.59 points.</p>
<p>Earlier, the Nikkei 225 average in Tokyo marked a new year's high of 20,815.48 points, before traders locked in their profits, sending down the index to close 36.11 points lower at 20,528.35 points.</p>
<p>"It has been a cautious day. We saw some profit-taking and bargain-hunting", one trader said.</p>
<p>Sumitomo Bank was the most actively traded share in London. The stock was up 40 yen to 1,827.5 yen. This compares with a rise of 60 yen to a close of 1,830 yen in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Toyo Trust shares were up 38 yen to 887.5 yen, but some 10 yen off from Tokyo's close.</p>
<p>Kyocera was down 340 yen to 8,695 yen, after order intake in May declined.</p>
