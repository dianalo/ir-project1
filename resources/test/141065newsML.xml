<headline>Carnival takes delivery of biggest liner.</headline>
<dateline>VENICE, Italy</dateline>
<text>
<p>U.S. cruise operator Carnival Corp. Thursday took delivery of the world's biggest ocean liner and said it planned a big expansion into the lucrative Asian market.</p>
<p>Carnival's chief executive Micky Arison and other company officials outlined plans to reporters at the official launch in Venice of the Carnival Destiny, which weighs 101,000 gross tons and looms taller than the Statue of Liberty.</p>
<p>The $400 million ship, moored in the lagoon about 300 yards from Saint Mark's Square, dwarfed the occasional passing canal taxi.</p>
<p>Lin Arison, wife of the founder of Carnival Corp, named the vessel and smashed a magnum of champagne against the hull. But city authorities refused permission for the scheduled sounding of the ship's horn because of noise regulations.</p>
<p>The liner, described by its owners as a floating "fun palace," will set sail for Boston on Friday morning, then go on to New York and Miami, from where it will embark on its maiden cruise around the Caribbean on Nov. 24.</p>
<p>"There is no question this new ship will be a great success. Bookings are already excellent for its maiden cruise in the Caribbean in November," Micky Arison said in an interview on board the ship.</p>
<p>The cruise ship was built in just 20 months by Italy's state shipbuilder Fincantieri at its dockyard in the northeastern port of Trieste. It can accommodate 3,400 passengers on 12 passenger decks as well as 1,000 crew.</p>
<p>It has a three-deck high theatre that can seat 1,500, the largest casino afloat, four swimming pools and seven restaurants and cafes. Nearly two-thirds of all cabins have ocean views.</p>
