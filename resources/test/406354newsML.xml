<title>USA: Network stocks spark tech selloff, Nasdaq slammed.</title>
<headline>Network stocks spark tech selloff, Nasdaq slammed.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-02-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Massive selling in networking stocks spread throughout the technology sector, dragging Nasdaq shares down more than two percent on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite crumbled 27.89 points or 2.08 percent to 1312.66, the largest point drop since July 23. The Dow industrials fell 58 points to 6925.</p>
<p>The proposed merger of 3Com Corp and U.S. Robotics Corp sparked selling in networking stocks as some analysts said the deal put a low-ball premium on U.S. Robotics. 3Com sank four to 35 in heavy trading, while U.S. Robotics fell 1-7/8 to 59-1/8.</p>
<p>"People think the deal was weak. And that slammed them and the rest of the techs," one trader said. "The market has been so nervous in the past two days with (Federal Reserve Chairman Alan) Greenspan's remarks and the tech disaster today."</p>
<p>Intel Corp fell 6-41/64 to 139-47/64, Dell Computer Corp dropped 5-5/8 to 70-1/8 and Microsoft Corp shed 4-1/8 to 96-1/8.</p>
<p>"The momentum players are getting out of tech names," said another trader.</p>
<p>Overall, declining issues beat gainers 2449 to 1865 on total volume of 685 million shares.</p>
