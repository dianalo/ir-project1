<text>
<p>Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade Inc. said Friday it expects to report a first-quarter loss on a 5 to 7 percent decline in sales, significantly worse than Wall Street analysts' expectations.</p>
<p>A year earlier, the maker of premium ice cream reported a profit.</p>
<p>Ben &amp; Jerry's stock fell $1.75 to $11.50 in morning trading on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>"This sales decline, coupled with planned reduced production levels designed to lower the company's inventories, signficantly reduced the company's gross margins in the first quarter of 1997. In addition, increased commodity costs continued to negatively impact the company's gross margin," it said.</p>
<p>The company expects to report a loss equal to 12 cents to 15 cents a share, significantly worse than the eight cents a share in profits expected by analysts. A year earlier, Ben &amp; Jerry's earned $1.36 million, or 19 cents a share, on sales of $37.9 million.</p>
<p>"Although financial results are disappointing, the company anticipates a return to profitability for the remainder of 1997," it added.</p>
<p>Ben &amp; Jerry's is counting on the popularity of a new flavor called Phish, named after the rock band that plays its own material in the style of the Grateful Dead.</p>
<p>"We're optimistic for Phish. It's been very much a big hit," said Chief Financial Officer Frances Rathke, adding that the company first began shipping the chocolate ice cream with marshmallows and caramel in March.</p>
<p>She blamed Midwest flooding "where our trucks couldn't get to the stores or even our customers could not literally make it to the stores," accounting for about 20 percent of the sales volume decline during the quarter.</p>
<p>In addition, continuing high diary costs, a "pretty flat industry" and reduced production levels all contributed to cutting into the company's profits, she said.</p>
<p>Edward Froelich, who follows Ben &amp; Jerry's for Pershing/Div. of DLJ -- Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette -- said of the company's statement: "There's not a positive glow on this. They're looking for Phish to do well, but we can't be enthusiatic at this point.</p>
<p>"It's trading near its low for the year and could set a new one," Froelich said. "It is something that has value, but that's not shining through today."</p>
<p>The company added that it will be shipping its new line of low-fat ice cream in early April.</p>
