<p>The Russian government stepped up pressure on the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to keep St. Petersburg in the running for the 2004 Games, saying on Monday that hosting the event would reinforce Russia's new democracy.</p>
<p>"It is absolutely vital to have support which confirms the correctness of the course of reform Russia has chosen," First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Ilyushin told a news conference.</p>
<p>"Holding the 2004 Olympic Games in St. Petersburg could give powerful international backing to Russia's democratic transformation."</p>
<p>Ilyushin, a former top aide to President Boris Yeltsin, will head the Russian delegation to Lausanne next week to try to persuade the IOC to put Russia's second city on the shortlist of candidates for the 2004 Games.</p>
<p>The IOC will announce on March 7 a shortlist of five cities from the original 11 contenders. The final choice will be made on September 5.</p>
<p>Rome and Athens are among the early favourites but Russian officials remain publicly optimistic that their pledge of strong government support and an improved economy in seven years' time will allow impoverished St. Petersburg to stage a worthy Games.</p>
<p>Russian Olympic Committee officials repeated their criticism on Monday of last week's IOC evaluation document, which estimated the cost of a St. Petersburg Olympics at $9.6 billion.</p>
<p>Russia insists most of the cash to upgrade the Baltic city's infrastructure and sports facilities is already pledged for its 300th anniversary in 2003 and that only $2.1 billion is needed for the Games themselves.</p>
