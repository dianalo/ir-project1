<p>President Clinton was likely to get a briefing from Labour Secretary Alexis Herman on the United Parcel Service strike as they fly to St. Louis Tuesday for a presidential speech, a White House official said.</p>
<p>The official said Herman's presence was not related to the strike, saying she had always been scheduled to travel with Clinton because the event's subject of moving people from welfare to work falls within the concerns of the Labour Department.</p>
<p>"They are likely to have an opportunity to talk about the UPS strike on the way there," said the official. "Because of the nature of the event, she had always been scheduled to go."</p>
<p>UPS and Teamsters union representatives met with Herman Monday but there were few signs of a break in the 9-day-old strike.</p>
<p>"I made it clear that everyone involved must show greater flexibility and a willingness to compromise," Herman said Monday, describing the meetings as serious but offering no indication of progress.</p>
<p>Teamsters President Ron Carey told reporters after his meeting with Herman that he was ready to go back to the bargaining table, but only for serious negotiations.</p>
<p>UPS negotiator Dave Murray said the firm was not changing its offer despite Herman's calls for flexibility. "We still believe that the correct solution to this is for the Teamsters to put our people back to work and send our offer out for a vote," Murray said.</p>
<p>Before the strike, which has been described by a federal mediator as biggest in the United States in the past 25 years, Atlanta-based UPS delivered about 80 percent of all packages shipped by ground nationwide.</p>
