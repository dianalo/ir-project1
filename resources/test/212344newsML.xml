<headline>Rivals try to calm tension in Cambodian city.</headline>
<dateline>BATTAMBANG, Cambodia 1996-11-23</dateline>

<p>Political rivals met in Cambodia's second city on Saturday after trouble between their followers.</p>
<p>Deputy provincial governor Serey Kosal of the royalist FUNCINPEC party, who ordered troops to seal off the city on Friday, said the Cambodian People's Party had asked him to withdraw his forces.</p>
<p>"I cannot withdraw my troops unless I have an order from (FUNCINPEC military chief) Nhiek Bun Chhay and (FUNCINPEC president) Prince Norodom Ranariddh," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>But Battambang Governor Um Samy of the CPP declared that the two-hour talks were a success and "Everything is solved."</p>
<p>Local tension between the two groups reflects growing strain between them in the coalition government in Phnom Penh which has two prime minister, the royalists' Ranariddh and CCP's Hun Sen.</p>
<p>Battambang itself, 300 km (190 miles) northwest of the capital, appeared calm with restaurants open as usual and no unusual numbers of police or troops.</p>
<p>There were conflicting accounts of Friday night's trouble. Royalists said military police had tried to disarm some FUNCINPEC soldiers. The CCP said the police were called to quiet a drunken party.</p>
<p>A person was seriously wounded but the deputy governor said a report that one was killed had turned out to be incorrect.</p>
