<p>Kuwait has cleared all its long-term foreign debts, repaying the final slice of a $5.5 billion sovereign loan used to rebuild the country after the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
<p>The Kuwait Investment Authority, the state's international borrowing and financial arm, said a last payment of $786 million was made on Thursday, the Kuwait News Agency reported.</p>
<p>"With the final payment Kuwait will have no outstanding long-term foreign debts," one banker earlier said of the jumbo loan which was taken out after a U.S.-led coalition freed Kuwait from a seven-month occupation by Iraq.</p>
<p>Some 80 banks from 19 countries contributed to the loan, arranged by J.P. Morgan and Co, which at the time was the largest ever made to a sovereign state.</p>
<p>Kuwait's Central Bank Governor Sheikh Salem Abdul-Aziz al-Sabah was quoted last year as saying his country, once one of the world's largest investors, would not borrow from international markets again.</p>
<p>The country's global investments have dropped to around $35 billion from over $100 billion mainly due to the huge Gulf War costs.</p>
<p>Kuwait's 4.21 billion dinar ($14 billion) budget for fiscal 1996/97 (July-June) projects a net deficit of 1.21 billion dinars. But it is based on oil revenue calculated at a weighted average price of $13 a barrel while current world prices for Kuwait's crudes are around $20 a barrel.</p>
<p>Kuwait produces about two million barrels of oil a day.</p>
