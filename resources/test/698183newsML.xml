<p>Italy and Greece won their second-phase groups in the European basketball championships on Tuesday to earn straightforward quarter-final games against Turkey and Poland respectively.</p>
<p>France and Israel were the two sides eliminated from Group E, while 1993 champions Germany and the hotly-tipped Croatian side made early exits in Group F.</p>
<p>Greece survived some difficult moments to win their game against Israel 85-82 and with it Group E.</p>
<p>Greek coach Panagiotis Giannakis said he was pleased with the performance of his side so far in the tournament.</p>
<p>"I never thought we would achieve six consecutive victories," he said.</p>
<p>But Giannakis warned against overconfidence in the game against Poland, who took the last qualifying place in Group F with a 86-76 win over Germany.</p>
<p>"Poland is a country with a great basketball tradition," he said.</p>
<p>The other unbeaten side, Italy, will face Turkey who beat France 82-71.</p>
<p>Italy's five consecutive victories -- including wins over both Yugoslavia and Spain -- were enough for them to win Group F even before Tuesday's game with Croatia, which started late.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia took second place in the group after beating the hosts 79-70.</p>
<p>The result earnt the Yugoslavs a quarter-final slot against the losers of the game between Russia and Lithuania, which also started late.</p>
<p>Spain will face the winners of the same match in the last quarter final.</p>
