<p>Japan will tell visiting U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin that its economic recovery is becoming firmer, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka told a news conference on Friday.  </p>
<p>Asked how he would respond to an expected U.S. expression of concern about the size of Japan's trade surplus, Mitsuzuka said:</p>
<p>The present state of our economy is that it is gradually recovering and the gait of the recovery is becoming steadier, he said. We will tell this (to Rubin).  </p>
<p>The minister said he would also discuss the issue of Japan's financial system during his meeting with Rubin.</p>
<p>"I will tell him that we are steadily carrying out the 'Big Bang' reforms of our financial system," he said.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka said that the implementation of these reforms would lead to the resolution of Japanese banks' bad loans and remove concerns about the Japanese financial system.</p>
<p>He said he would seek to convince the United States that Japan would achieve economic recovery led by domestic demand.  </p>
<p>Mitsuzuka said that recent economic indicators showed that Japan's economic recovery was becoming firmer, led by private demand.</p>
<p>He also said that he was not overly concerned about the recent rise in Japan's car exports.</p>
<p>"The rise in car exports alone will not lead to a substantial imbalance of the trade account."</p>
<p>Asked whether the issue of foreign exchange rates would be discussed in his meeting with Rubin, Mitsuzuka said he would discuss the issue if it came up, but added:</p>
<p>"The foreign exchange market has been moderate recently."</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka and Rubin are due to meet at noon (0300 GMT).  </p>
<p>Mitsuzuka told the same news conference that the recent fall in the share price of Nippon Credit Bank Ltd would be temporary.</p>
<p>He said the fall was due to NCB's plan to issue new stocks to boost its capital.</p>
