<text>
<p>Lazare Kaplan International Inc said Friday its board had adopted a shareholder rights plan with a 15 percent trigger.</p>
<p>Under the plan, one preferred share purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of common stock.</p>
<p>The company said the rights are not being distributed in response to any effort to acquire control of the company, and the board is not aware of any such effort.</p>
<p>The rights will be exercisable if a person or group acquires or announces a tender offer to acquire 15 percent or more of the company's common stock.</p>
<p>Each right will entitle the holder to buy one-hundredth share of a new series of junior participating preferred stock at an exercise price of $90.</p>
<p>The distribution will be made on September 9 to stockholders of record on that date. The rights will expire on July 31, 2007.</p>
