<p>Three babies died and a woman was badly burned when fire swept through the attic bedroom of a day-care centre in northwestern Spain on Friday, police said.</p>
<p>The one-year-olds had been sleeping in the attic when the fire broke out at about noon, engulfing the wooden roof and causing it to collapse.</p>
<p>The woman, a worker at the centre, suffered burns on 50 percent of her body and a fireman suffered from smoke inhalation as they tried to rescue the infants.</p>
<p>Panicky parents rushed to the centre in the port city of Vigo, but the other children escaped unharmed, Vigo's mayor said.</p>
<p>The blaze could have been started by a short-circuit in the 20-year-old house, he said, adding that firefighters were still investigating.</p>
