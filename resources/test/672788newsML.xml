<p>Lai Sun Development Co Ltd said it had agreed to buy a 45.42 percent stake in Furama Hotel Enterprises Ltd from Townsend International Ltd for HK$3.13 billion and would make an offer for remaining shares.  </p>
<p>Lai Sun Development said on Friday it had signed a conditional agreement to buy 93.45 million shares from Townsend at HK$33.50 per share and would launch a general offer for the remaining shares at HK$33.50 per share cash.</p>
<p>The deal values Furama's share capital at about HK$6.89 billion.</p>
<p>Lai Sun Development said the acquisition would be financed through internal resources and bank borrowings.</p>
<p>The company has already made a payment of HK$626.10 million which it said would not be returned under any circumstances. The balance would be paid on completion of the deal.  </p>
<p>The agreement is subject to the approval of shareholders of the Lai Sun Garment (International) Ltd group. Lai Sun Garment owns about 39 percent of Lai Sun Development.</p>
<p>Lai Sun Development owns about 52.83 percent of Lai Sun Hotels International Ltd.</p>
<p>Trading in shares of Lai Sun Development, Lai Sun Garment, Lai Sun Hotels and Furama was suspended on Wednesday and was due to resume on Friday, Lai Sun Development said.</p>
<p>It said its offer price of HK$33.50 per share for Furama represented a 28.8 percent premium over Furama's closing price on Tuesday of HK$26.00.  </p>
<p>The offer also represented a premium of about HK$17.10 over net asset value per share. Based on financial statements for the year ended March 31, 1996, Furmama's consolidated net asset value was about HK$3.34 billion, or HK$16.40 per share.</p>

<p>"The acquisition represents an excellent opportunity for the LSD group to acquire...a prime asset, located in the central business district of Hong Kong, that will further strengthen the asset base and investment portfolio of LSD," Lai Sun Development said.</p>
<p>"The LSD directors believe that there should be synergies between the businesses of Furama and its subsidiaries and the LSD Group. In this connection, the LSD directors, upon completion of the offer, will explore these possibilities within the LSD group," it added.</p>
<p>Lai Sun Development said it had given a non-competition undertaking regarding the businesses of Lai Sun Hotels.  </p>
<p>It said it did not intend to make any material changes to the principal activities of the Furama group or inject any material assets or businesses into Furama.</p>
<p>After the offer, Lai Sun said Adrian Fu, Fu Yim Chiu, Fu Yam Chi, James Fu, William Fu and James Yip would resign as directors of Furama and it would nominate new directors.</p>
<p>It said it intended to maintain the listing of Furama on the stock exchange</p>
<p>Wheelock and Co Ltd owns about 23.18 percent of Furama Hotel.</p>
