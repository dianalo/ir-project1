<p>Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak will meet Moroccan King Hassan II on Friday for talks on the fragile Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>Mubarak's visit falls amid Palestinian anger over Israeli plans to build Jewish homes in Arab East Jerusalem and over the extent of a planned Israeli pullback from occupied land.</p>
<p>It also comes one day after a Jordanian soldier shot dead seven teenaged Israeli schoolgirls.</p>
<p>A Moroccan official said on Thursday that Mubarak would stop in Morocco on his way back to Egypt from the United States, where he discussed problems facing the peace process with U.S. President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Palestinians have been angered by Israeli plans to build 6,500 homes for Jews in Arab East Jerusalem, and also for the scale of an Israeli pullback from occupied land.</p>
<p>Palestinian President Yasser Arafat visited Morocco on February 25 and said he and King Hassan had agreed on the need to hold an urgent meeting of the Al Qods (Jerusalem) committee, which the Moroccan monarch heads.</p>
