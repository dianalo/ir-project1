<p>The decline in growth of Indian industrial output, which began in the second half of 1995/96 (April-March), is expected to be reversed in the second half of 1996/97, the independent Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) said in a report released on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>"We expect that recent changes in the factors which brought about the decline in the growth of industrial production would reverse the trend and industrial output would pick up during the second half of 1996/97," CMIE said in its latest monthly review.</p>
<p>CMIE attributed the slowdown in industrial growth to three factors:</p>
<p>+ The persistence of high interest rates since early 1995, compounded by a liquidity squeeze around October 1995. "This hurt working capital availability to small and medium companies, leading to production disruptions."</p>
<p>+ Fall in growth of rural demand. "Seven consecutive normal monsoons and a steady increase in support prices from an usually farmer-friendly government gave rise to a major and fast growing source of demand for industrial goods in rural areas."</p>
<p>"However, in 1995/96, when the eighth normal monsoon was not normal enough for farm output, agricultural production declined by 0.2 percent, affecting rural demand for industrial goods and leading to inventory build-ups."</p>
<p>+ Power shortages. "The biggest infrastructural constraint during 1995/96 was lack of sufficient power generation. Power shortages, particularly in the south, which depend considerably on hydel power, had shot up to 19 percent."</p>
<p>CMIE said the October 19 monetary policy of the Reserve Bank of India is expected to lead to lowering of interest rates.</p>
<p>The 1996 south-west monsoon was normal and the temporal and spatial distribution was excellent.</p>
<p>"As a result, the agricultural crop in 1996/97 is estimated to be 4.7 percent higher than in 1995/96. This is expected to lead to a higher demand from the rural markets," it said.</p>
<p>"Thanks to copious rains in 1996, hydro power generation, which had declined by 12.5 percent in 1995/96, is expected to contribute handsomely to power generation in 1996/97," it said.</p>
<p>CMIE said it expected industrial sector to first start reducing its inventories around the third quarter and production to pick up by December 1996-January 1997.</p>
