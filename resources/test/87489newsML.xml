<p>Germany's largest bank, Deutsche Bank AG said it would fight against any downgrading of its triple-A credit rating, but made clear that any change should not adversely affect the status of the bank.</p>
<p>The bank's chief executive, Hilmar Kopper, told a news conference, "There are only three banks in the world which have this rating and is not reasonable to term this a category. But we will fight doggedly to retain the rating."  </p>
<p>Kopper, in Washington for international meetings, repeated that the bank did not understand why Moody's had taken a recent decision to review its rating, adding the main reason seemed to be that the German banking environment was hard.</p>
<p>"Moody's says it is hard in the German banking world...It is," Kopper said, adding that that was one reason why the bank had decided to diversify abroad and round out its portfolio.</p>
<p>"We will fight, and if we do not win then we will bear it with dignity," he said.  </p>
<p>Moody's decision to put Deutsche's long-term rating on its review list came only days after Standard &amp; Poor's said it was monitoring developments at the bank.</p>
<p>(Corrects to show S&amp;P did not put Deutsche on its review list but</p>
<p>simply said it was monitoring developments).</p>
<p>The S &amp; P comment followed the suspension of three British-based funds belonging to Deutsche's subsidiary Morgan Grenfell Asset Management due to "irregularities".</p>
<p>The problems, which revolved around illegally large investments in non-listed stocks, meant Deutsche had to pump millions of marks into the funds to buy up the paper.</p>
<p>Rejecting criticism about the way in which Deutsche had handled the incident, Kopper said the bank had been praised from within the professional world for the swift action it had taken to ensure investors did not lose out from the problems.</p>
<p>"The public reaction is of course very different. But that is something we have to deal with," he said.</p>
