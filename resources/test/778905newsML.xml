<p>The Arab League on Tuesday condemned as a declaration of war Israel's crackdown in Palestinian self-rule areas after two suicide attacks in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The League's permanent representatives also held Israel responsible for the bombings last week in the market in which 15 people, including two bombers, were killed and 170 wounded.</p>
<p>"The (League's) council strongly condemns the Israeli...measures...and considers them a declaration of war against the Palestinian people and its political leadership," it said.</p>
<p>The 22-member League met in response to a Palestinian call to assess the crisis in PLO-Israeli peacemaking.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet suspended peace talks with Palestinians and demanded a crackdown on Moslem militants responsible for the Jerusalem attack.</p>
<p>It also cut-off Palestinian self rule areas.</p>
<p>"The League's council confirms that this explosive situation and the acts of violence in the region... are one result of stopping the peace process due to Israel's practises and not adhering to signed agreements," the League's statement said.</p>
<p>"The council totally rejects Israeli allegations holding the Palestinian National Authority responsible for the violence."</p>
<p>Palestinian League representative Mohamed Sobeih said in a speech the Israeli measures were "a war of starvation and destruction of life... It is a total state of war".</p>
<p>"It is clear that this government of Israel does not want to proceed in the peace process and wants to Judaise Jerusalem," he told reporters.</p>
<p>Sobeih blasted the United States Congress and said the U.S. administration should act fast to save the peace process. "If the U.S. administration does not act now as a sponsor of the peace process, the peace process will be in serious danger."</p>
<p>Congress earlier this year passed a bill requiring the move of the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and Republican Speaker Newt Gingrich has said after last week's bombings that he backed all steps Israel took against Palestinian militants.</p>
<p>Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said he would send messages to the United Nations, European Union, Organisation of African Unity and other international bodies urging action to lift Israel's blockade of Palestinian areas.</p>
<p>The Arab League's meeting came amid intensive diplomacy in the Middle East in search of a way out of the crisis in Israeli-PLO peacemaking. U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross is expected in the region later this week.</p>
