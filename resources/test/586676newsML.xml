<p>Massachusetts attorney general's office continued to defend the state's law requiring tobacco companies to disclose their brands' ingredients even as talks to settle a dispute continued on Thursday.</p>
<p>Massachusetts Attorney General Scott Harshbarger's office, in a brief submitted to the U.S. 1st Circuit Court of Appeals, argued the state law, set to go into effect on Nov. 1, does not affect labeling or advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.</p>
<p>The tobacco industry, led by Philip Morris, appealed a lower court's order that it comply with the state law that requires cigarette and smokeless tobacco makers to submit a list of ingredients by weight for each brand sold within the commonwealth to Massachusett's Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>The DPH, under the law, will then make those ingredients that present a health hazard public .</p>
<p>The industry argues that such a move would make public their trade secrets and costs them billions of dollars in lost business.</p>
<p>But Assistant Attorney General Rebecca McIntyre argued the companies already disclose their ingredients to U.S. Health and Human Services Department and that "Congress had no intention of nationalizing the trade secret status of cigarette ingredient information in order to protect commerce."</p>
<p>The appeals court is expected to hear oral arguments on the measure in early June. Both sides are hoping for a ruling before the court breaks for its summer recess in August.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Harshbarger along with 28 other state attorneys general were expecting to hold a conference call later Thursday to get an update on how settlement talks with the industry were proceeding.</p>
<p>Harshbarger said the attorneys general were holding "at least weekly" conference calls concerning the negotiations. "The idea is to keep everybody informed at the same time," he said.</p>
