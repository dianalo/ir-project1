<p>EIS International Inc. said Monday it will discontinue Surefind, its Pittsburgh online data backup and recovery services business, and lay off about a fourth of its estimated staff of 400 employees.</p>
<p>EIS, a major provider of call centre management software, systems and services, said the restructuring will result in charges in the next two quarters.</p>
<p>Many of the layoffs were effective Friday, and others go into effect Monday, it said.</p>
<p>The Herndon, Va.-based company's systems business includes its call centre management software and services, such as software that handles outbound telemarketing.</p>
<p>Senior Vice President Carol Blaszczynski said the company would detail fourth-quarter charges when it releases financial results at month's end.</p>
<p>As part of the restructuring, the company will close its corporate office in Pittsburgh and downsize Cybernetics, which develops and sells the "Workforce Manager" management product.</p>
<p>The company said it will also close a facility in Coral Gables, Fla., and integrate Pulse, its Chantilly, Va.-based subsidiary, into its systems business.</p>
<p>EIS's stock rose 25 cents to $6.125 on Nasdaq in early afternoon trading.</p>
