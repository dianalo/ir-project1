<p>Four days after mounting a big protest march against President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil's Landless Movement (MST) has threatened to step up its land invasions, a newspaper reported on Monday.</p>
<p>O Globo newspaper quoted MST leader Jose Rainha Junior as saying that 5,000 members of the movement planned to invade 500,000 hectares (1.25 million acres) of land in the Pontal de Paranapanema in western Sao Paulo state.</p>
<p>Rainha said the MST would take the land, much of which belongs to private individuals, because the government had not fulfilled its promise to audit the region and check whether the properties were being used productively.</p>
<p>"The (Agrarian Reform) Minister has already been told. If we can't reach a solution over the land, we are going to invade them," Rainha was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>He said the land invasions could take place as soon as this week, the newspaper reported.</p>
<p>More than 45,000 members of MST have illegally occupied thousands of acres of what they claim is unproductive land in an attempt to speed up the government's land reform programme.</p>
<p>Last week the MST assembled over 25,000 people in Brasilia in the biggest mass demonstration against Cardoso's two-year-old government. Protesters called for faster land reform and an end to free market policies that increased unemployment and cut government subsidies.</p>
<p>The MST has emerged as a formidable left-wing force in Brazil by turning the country's history of unfair land distribution into a major political issue.</p>
<p>Meeting MST leaders on Friday, Cardoso promised to set up a commission to study the possibility of settling 500,000 landless families in the next two years, one of the MST's demands.</p>
<p>The government has pledged to settle 280,000 families during its four-year term. But Cardoso said the land invasions must stop.</p>
<p>Rainha said the MST was planning new demonstrations, this time in Sao Paulo state. O Globo quoted him as saying the MST was planning a march that would begin in the Pontal do Paranapanema and reach Sao Paulo city on July 25, Brazil's Rural Worker's Day.</p>
<p>"It will be the biggest march in the history of the MST. We are going to assemble 500,000 people, to make 1997 the year of agrarian reform in Brazil," Rainha was quoted as saying.</p>
