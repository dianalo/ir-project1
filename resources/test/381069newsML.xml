<p>Coups and earthquakes, war and famine have long driven government policies and dominated news worldwide. Now, according to the World Bank, add the subject of pensions, which it has called "the biggest crisis of our time".</p>
<p>The unglamorous world of retirement and the pensions industry is being forced centre stage because of the growing gulf in many countries between what is being paid into state and private pension schemes and what is being drawn out.</p>
<p>After decades when generous pensions padded social security budgets and boosted national deficits, governments are realising that the present level of handouts is not sustainable.</p>
<p>In developed countries people are living longer and continuing to draw benefits. Population growth is dropping, with fewer people in formal jobs paying pension premiums. Schemes devised when a natural lifespan was "three score years and ten" are now struggling to cope with the extended claims.</p>
<p>Developing countries have a younger workforce and can make a fresh start but will still battle to meet expectations of higher standards of living.</p>
<p>Chile, seen as a model after it overhauled its bankrupt state pension system in just 10 years, was able to make changes by diktat, not possible in many democratic nations.</p>
<p>In older pension schemes, the "funding gap" problem has been smouldering for years, masked by creeping budget deficits and a political taboo which made attempts to cut pensions look like an attack on vulnerable, elderly (but still voting) citizens.</p>
<p>IMF TELLS GOVERNMENTS TO MOVE FAST</p>
<p>A recent International Monetary Fund (IMF) report indicates the scale of the problem and urges governments to act fast.</p>
<p>The ratio of net pension liabilities to gross domestic product (GDP) (the net present value of the difference between the projected spending and revenues) between 1995 and 2050 was 5.0 percent for the UK; 26 percent for the United States; 68 percent for Canada; 76 percent for Italy; 107 percent for Japan; 111 percent for Germany and 114 percent for France.</p>
<p>Put another way, the IMF said that if Italy is spending 16 percent of its GDP on pensions now it must immediately increase that to 18.5 percent up to 2050 just to keep pace with payouts.</p>
<p>The figures for France are 12.1 percent of GDP now, to rise to 15.4 percent; Germany at 10.3 percent now, up to 13.7 percent, the United States at 4.7 percent now, to 5.5 percent; Britain at 4.2 percent now, to 4.3 percent, Canada at 3.8 percent now to 5.8 percent and Japan at 3.9 percent now to 7.2 percent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the private sector has generally steered clear of what was widely seen as a government problem. But that too is changing rapidly as countries already enthused with the concept of privatisation seek to unload pension liabilities.</p>
<p>PROFOUND ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL IMPACT</p>
<p>The political and economic implications of these trends are far-reaching -- affecting individuals, families, government policies and financial markets, because of the financial muscle of pension funds, some of which control billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Governments can approach the funding gap in various ways, but the longer they wait to act, the more daunting their task. They can raise taxes and/or the retirement age, offer less generous packages -- all unpopular -- or offer tax relief on private pension provision, a fiscally punishing move for the state.</p>
<p>Any option will be painful. A policy group in Germany said this month pensions must be cut from 70 percent now to to 64 percent of average net wages by 2030, but that contributions would have to rise to 22.9 percent from 17.5 percent of wages now.</p>
<p>In many countries there is the prospect of those now in jobs paying twice -- for themselves and their parents -- in an "inter generational fiscal war" which experts say will have profound social effects.</p>
<p>Private pension providers are responding to the funding gap by changing pensions structures from defined benefit schemes, where the final pension depends on final salary levels, to defined contribution determined by premiums paid in.</p>
<p>To meet their liabilities many funds are taking greater risks, hoping for better returns, which will immediately impact the markets they invest in. They will also be looking for risk-lowering diversification by investing globally.</p>
<p>PENSION FUNDS LOOK TO EQUITY MARKETS</p>
<p>The first shift for most pension funds will be out of domestic bonds into domestic equities and then to foreign bond and stock holdings. Only three years ago, British pension funds had less than three percent of their portfolios in emerging markets. Already it is 5.0 percent and set to grow.</p>
<p>Governments eager to shed the pensions burden have touted the potential pensions market as a golden business opportunity. Like many other trends in the industry, that began in the United States. However, official U.S. data shows only half of those in jobs have some kind of private retirement plan, a figure unchanged in 20 years.</p>
<p>Also, the fiscal, administrative and cultural barriers to cross border marketing of financial products are formidable. In 1994, after four years of trying, the European Union gave up efforts to agree a Euro Pensions Directive, although there are now new efforts to revive it.</p>
<p>The good news for clients, fund managers say, is that private pension providers will start to meet stiff competition on fees and services. But will a Greek pensioner accept a pension run by a Japanese finance house? If governments have been slow to tackle the pensions funding gap, individuals, especially in their early earning years, are just as reluctant to prepare for their old age.</p>
<p>A Beatles hit song of the 1960s asks: "Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm 64?" In the next millenium, partners will be landed with each other well past that.</p>
