<p>Shares in regional and Eastern European bottler Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd fell sharply on Wednesday after a newspaper reported that a leading broker had assigned a fair value of about A$5.00 below its current price, dealers said.</p>
<p>The Australian Financial Review newspaper said the First Pacific brokerage firm had allocated a fair value of A$12.50 on C-C Amatil compared with the stock's Monday closing price of A$17.60.</p>
<p>C-C Amatil shares were 15 cents lower at A$17.45 at 10.15 a.m. (0015 GMT).  </p>
<p>One broker said the share price fall was also in line with the weakness in the overall market.</p>
<p>"Coke is the kind of stock which tends to move more quickly than others on the upside and the downside," he said.</p>
<p>C-C Amatil, which is 40 percent-owned by The Coca-Cola Co, is one of the most keenly sought stocks on the Australian share market.</p>
<p>The company recently secured further regional bottling rights in Eastern Europe and has also struck an agreement with Malaysian businessman Robert Kuok to take a 9.3 percent stake.</p>
