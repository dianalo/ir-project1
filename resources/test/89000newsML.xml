<p>American folksinger Bob Dylan's face is now safe in Germany.</p>
<p>A German court on Tuesday ordered a compact disk manufacturer to stop marketing a bootleg recording of a Dylan concert that sported his face on the cover.</p>
<p>A legal loophole prevented the court from banning the pirate recording itself, but the manufacturer was forbidden from using the singer's image any longer.</p>
<p>The recording, made illicitly at a U.S. concert, went on sale in 1992, priced at nine to 15 marks.</p>
<p>Lower German courts had earlier ruled in favour of the defendant, Perfect Beat Tontraeger, because Dylan was deemed a person of historic importance.</p>
<p>Moreover, international regulations in effect since January 1995 allow the marketing of live recordings made outside the country.</p>
<p>The ruling has little practical consequence, because the manufacturer has gone into liquidation.</p>
