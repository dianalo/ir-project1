<p>Evergreen Forests Ltd said on Friday the share placement to buy Fletcher Forests' South Auckland plantation for NZ$30 million would effectively reduce Xylem's holding to 45 percent from 60 percent.</p>
<p>Evergreen Chief Executive Mark Bogle told Reuters from Boston that the placement would help address one of the problems the stock had been penalised for -- illiquidity.</p>
<p>It would also go some way towards improving Evergreen's cashflow profile and would assist economies of scale -- two other negatives that have been attached to the company.  </p>
<p>Evergreen said earlier that it had placed 30 million shares at NZ$0.555 a share with U.S. institutional investors to help pay the NZ$30 million price tag.</p>
<p>U.S. fund manager Xylem Investments was not involved in the placement.</p>
<p>The balance would be drawn from its existing capitalised term loan facility it has with Westpac Banking Corp.</p>
<p>Bogle, in the U.S. to garner support for the placement, said the purchase was synergistic with Evergreen's cashflow profile and was complementary to its existing estate.  </p>
<p>At present, Evergreen's Poutu forest would represent a spurt of harvesting potential in the short term, but would then fall away as time progressed.</p>
<p>"The vast proportion of the NZ$30 million value in this acquisition is going to be derived in the next 8-10 years," he said. "Typically the acquisitions we consider available, and the ones that have been made, have had much longer term cashflow period and so it's great in that respect," he said.  </p>
<p>"Part of our strategy is to increase our size to get better economies of scale, so that is achieved. Second, is to improve our cashflow so we want to bring that forward and ultimately have a balanced estate," he said.</p>
<p>The transaction had resulted in a better shareholding spread but Bogle said the the aquisition was managed at a price that was non-dilutive. "In this case we are satisfied that it does not reduce that rate of return," he said.</p>
<p>"We are addressing those areas where we are deficient -- too small, too illiquid and with cash flows that are too distant and a bit lumpy," he said.  </p>
<p>The purchase would create a third regional cluster on top of its existing assets in the Gisborne and Northland regions.</p>
<p>Evergreen has bought 5,000 hectares over the course of its current financial year to June, bringing the total to 17,000 ha. Bogle said the company still aimed for a 30,000 ha balanced estate.</p>
<p>"We need to find complementary age-class profile investment opportunities," he said. While no further purchases were imminent, various proposals were in different stages, he said.  </p>
<p>Evergreen was formed in 1993 with market capitalisation of NZ$23 million to invest directly in plantation forestry through acquisition of exsting forests and through the purchase ofland for new planings.</p>
<p>The shares, issued in 1993 at NZ$1.00, traded one cent off at NZ$0.56 at Friday midsession.</p>
