<p>French far-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen sought on Tuesday to reassure worried supporters of his National Front party that he had not sold out to the left despite apparent contradictions in his election strategy.</p>
<p>"I never said people should vote for the left, I simply said in a rather complex analysis that obviously I would rather see a left-wing majority and cohabitation," the anti-immigration crusader told the Foreign Press Association on Tuesday.</p>
<p>He was referring to the prospect of power-sharing between a left-wing parliament and conservative President Jacques Chirac.</p>
<p>"There is complete agreement at the heart of the National Front," Le Pen said, dismissing reports of differences between himself and his deputies Bruno Gollnisch and Brune Megret.</p>
<p>Talk of rare dissension within the anti-immigrant party, which openly espouses racial inequality, surfaced after Megret told a news conference on Monday, "We do not seek a leftist victory" in France's May 25-June National Assembly election.</p>
<p>"I do not want a rightist Assembly. Nor do I want a leftist Assembly," Megret said. "And on the second round we will remain in the running wherever we can."</p>
<p>Megret and Gollnisch are both candidates, while Le Pen is not. Both men are openly vying to succeed the 68-year-old Le Pen, who shows no sign of retiring.</p>
<p>Le Pen, who seems at his most venemous when talking about Chirac, has said he would prefer the left to win the snap parliamentary election than the governing centre-right.</p>
<p>Failing a Front victory, he has said that cohabitation would best obstruct the president's drive for European integration, which Le Pen has described as "Hitler's dream come true".</p>
<p>He has also predicted that cohabitation would lead to the dissolution of parliament within a year, giving the Front a new opportunity to gain ground.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Le Pen said he wanted the Front to win as many votes as possible in both the first and second rounds.</p>
<p>Opinion pollsters say how Front supporters vote in runoffs could be crucial to the election outcome.</p>
<p>Concerned that some loyalists may have misinterpreted his pronouncements, Le Pen said his goal was "to get as many votes as possible in the first round and to inflict as severe a defeat as possible on the president and on the outgoing majority".</p>
<p>As for the second round, the party would decide what to do after the first-round, he said.</p>
<p>Le Pen's 90-minute session with the Foreign Press Association was punctuated by emotional outbursts and shouting matches between Jewish journalists, Le Pen and a moderator.</p>
<p>A Swiss correspondent stormed out before le Pen could open his mouth, denouncing his 1987 statement that Nazi gas chambers were "a detail of history", a remark for which he was fined by a French court in 1990 for inciting racial hatred.</p>
<p>While reiterating his conviction that the gas chambers would take up only a few pages of a thousand-page history of World War Two, Le Pen said journalists had ignored a 1987 comment that he was sorry for any pain his remark might have caused.</p>
<p>A journalist for Radio J, run by France's Jewish community, asked Le Pen whether he considered French Jews were foreigners, triggering another shouting match. Le Pen said they were not foreigners if they had French citzenship.</p>
