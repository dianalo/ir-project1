<p>The Nicaraguan government has started peace talks with the leaders of armed gangs remaining from its civil war and expects to negotiate their disarming by the end of February, a government official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Jaime Cuadra told a news conference that a government delegation on Monday met with rebel leaders in a "peace zone" near the town of Ayapa in the northern province of Jinotega, one of three such zones where the rebels have assembled to begin the talks.</p>
<p>"I can assure you we should be optimistic about these talks since we found a good will among the gangs to exchange their guns for ploughs," said Vice Minister of Defence Jose Adan Guerra, who led the government delegation.</p>
<p>Nicaragua's bloody civil war ended in 1990, but many former combatants later re-armed to protest what they said was the government's failure to honour the terms of the peace treaty.</p>
<p>Despite repeated amnesties, the problem has not gone away. Since 1990, armed bands loosely linked to former Contra rebels or the Sandinista army have killed 1,000 people, wounded 400 and kidnapped 600 civilians, according to army figures.</p>
<p>About 500 members of 33 armed gangs continued to operate in the north and central provinces of Matagalpa, Jinotega and Chontales, Cuadra said.</p>
<p>Adan Guerra said rebel leaders will present a list of their demands on Feb. 15 and will meet with the government delegation "almost immediately" afterwards.</p>
<p>While the government of President Arnoldo Aleman, which took power on Jan. 10, has put Feb. 28 as the deadline for an agreement with the gangs, Adan Guerra said the government was willing to extend the process past this date.</p>
<p>The government will offer the rebels land, seed, credit, health centres and potable water in exchange for their disarming, he said.</p>
<p>In what is likely to be the most controversial point, Cuadra said the government was willing to offer amnesties to rebels, even those linked to crimes.</p>
<p>"If it is necessary to give pardons to win the peace, we will give them pardons," Cuadra said.</p>
<p>Among the rebel leaders included in the negotiations are commanders "Little Bird," "Black Paul" and "The Graduate," who are linked to the Northern Front 380 (Frente Norte 380), a gang descended from the Contra rebels, Cuadra said.</p>
