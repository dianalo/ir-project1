<p>Poland's Polisa Zycie life insurer, 46-percent owned by France's Caisse Nationale de Prevoyance, is offering two new products, the firm's head said on Friday.</p>
<p>Henryk Chmielak told a news conference that Polisa Zycie, 26-percent owned by Polish insurer Polisa, had launched family group life insurance and a group pension scheme for firms.</p>
<p>"In the second half of the year we plan to start heavy promotion of our two new products, family group life insurance and a pension programme for firms," Chmielak said.</p>
<p>He would not say to what degree the product might help raise the firm's 0.3-percent market share.</p>
<p>Chmielak also said that alongside expanding its insurance offer, the company would focus on developing its branch network, personnel training and computerisation.</p>
<p>Polisa Zycie's assets amount to 19.2 million zlotys.</p>
