<p>Senior West German politicians regularly passed secrets about NATO and the intentions of Washington "hawks" to East Germany during the Cold War, according to Markus Wolf, the retired spymaster of the defunct communist state.</p>
<p>In excerpts of his new book published by Stern magazine on Monday, Wolf said numerous West German politicians passed on highly useful information in conspiratorial contacts with the East German spy agency that he ran for three decades.</p>
<p>"They knew this was a conspiracy and they conscientiously used these channels of contact," Wolf said in his autobiography, which will be distributed in 14 countries on June 2.</p>
<p>"They were sceptical about developments in the West and considered it to be their moral duty to inform us about foreign and domestic policy developments they considered dangerous."</p>
<p>Wolf said there were numerous West Germans eager to help East Germany. He said Fritz Erler, a former defence policy expert for the Social Democrats and leader of the party in parliament, provided particularly useful information.</p>
<p>"His analyses about NATO's processes and his tips about the plans of the 'hawks' in Washington were important to us," Wolf said. "It was naturally not easy for him, but it was of tremendous value for us."</p>
<p>Western intelligence agencies long suspected security leaks from West Germany, fears that Wolf confirms for the first time in his book "Markus Wolf -- Spy Chief in a Secret War".</p>
<p>In excerpts published last week, Wolf said the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) offered him a house, a small fortune, and a new identity in California in exchange for Cold War secrets. He said the CIA and West Germany's BND intelligence agency both tried to recruit him shortly after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.</p>
<p>Wolf was convicted in 1993 of treason but that verdict was overturned by Germany's highest court in 1995. A verdict in a second trial on charges of kidnapping is due on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The six-month-long trial is the latest and possibly last attempt to punish the man who ran East Germany's foreign intelligence service for more than 30 years. Wolf, 74, is accused of three kidnappings.</p>
<p>In the second set of excerpts from his book, Wolf said that Herbert Wehner, a powerful figure in the West German Social Democrats (SPD) during the 1960s and 1970s, was especially eager to keep East Berlin informed.</p>
<p>"The CIA has spread the germ of a possible war between the two German states," Wehner told Wolf's agents in a top secret paper. "I am not making this up. The neutron bombs have been tailored to destroy the Ruhr Valley and Berlin."</p>
<p>Wolf says Wehner was constantly warning East Berlin about the plans of his party colleague, Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and trying to discredit him. Wehner told East Berlin that Schmidt was being sucked into "American-led politics of adventure."</p>
<p>"Wehner was repeatedly warning us about intrigues against us being planned in Bonn and in Moscow," Wolf said.</p>
<p>Wolf was long referred to by Western intelligence as the "Man Without a Face" because they did not know what he looked like. Thriller writers often took him as a model when depicting a sinister communist spy chief.</p>
<p>Wolf, who ran a network of around 4,000 foreign-based agents from his East Berlin headquarters, said it was never hard to get information from West Germany.</p>
<p>"Thanks to our sources in Bonn's foreign office, in embassies and in the government parties I had almost the same information as the West German Foreign Minister," Wolf wrote.</p>
