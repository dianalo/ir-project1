<p>Bill Clinton made history in 1996 by becoming the first Democratic president of the United States since Franklin Roosevelt to win re-election, and he will try to buck history again by having a successful second term.</p>
<p>Many presidents since George Washington have had troubled second terms, beset by scandal or bereft of energy, but Clinton believes he can have a successful four years and avoid feeling like 1850s President Franklin Pierce, who wrote: "After the White House what is there to do but drink?"</p>
<p>Upon winning what he called "the last campaign of my life" on November 5, Clinton positioned himself to govern from "the vital centre" in hopes of attracting moderates and turning a slim Republican majority in Congress to his advantage.</p>
<p>"Today the clamour of political conflict has subsided," he told the centrist Democratic Leadership Council. "A new landscape is taking place. The answer is clear: The centre can hold, the centre has held and the American people are demanding that it continue to do so."</p>
<p>MELLOW MOOD FOR CHRISTMAS</p>
<p>A mellow bipartisan mood has settled into Washington during this season of Christmas cheer, with both Republicans and Democrats proclaiming their ability to work together in broad terms and leaving the devilish details for the new year.</p>
<p>Partisan sabres will be no doubt be drawn on or about February 3, when Clinton submits his next budget to Capitol Hill and offers his proposals for limited tax cuts, changes in Medicare and new limits on spending.</p>
<p>Though Clinton defeated the Republican candidate Bob Dole, Republicans took some comfort because the president won by promoting what they consider some of their issues, such as balancing the budget, reducing government and fighting crime.</p>
<p>Presidential historian William Seale sees parallels between the current post-Cold War period and the post-Civil War era, when Ulysses S. Grant in his second inuaugural address essentially declared himself an administrator and left the running of the country to Congress.</p>
<p>"In understanding the Clinton presidency right now one has to look back in American history to the 19th Century," Seale said. "It is not particularly history repeating itself but it is the same general format of Congress being the one now. In a funny way the Republicans really won that."</p>
<p>DOMESTIC ISSUES DOMINATE AGENDA</p>
<p>Clinton, a student of history who sees himself more of a "progressive" sort like Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, has a second-term agenda weighted with domestic issues like reducing deficit spending, reforming welfare, improving schools and reforming the way political campaigns are financed.</p>
<p>His foreign policy agenda, though managed by a new team, will have the same goals as before: handling difficult relationships with Russia and China, expanding trade, controlling terrorism, drug trafficking and renegade states and trying to promote peace in areas like the Middle East.</p>
<p>"If the American people go into the new century confident about the future, Bill Clinton will have had a successful second term," said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.</p>
<p>How well Clinton will be able to work with Republicans may well depend on how far they pursue investigations into Democratic fundraising and a number of other potentially damaging scandals.</p>
<p>Both houses of Congress have committees preparing hearings into whether the Democratic Party illegally accepted campaign contributions from foreign sources and whether Clinton changed U.S. policy towards Asia under pressure from a wealthy Indonesian family.</p>
<p>At the same time, independent lawyer Kenneth Starr has reported he is making progress on other investigations into the Clintons' financial dealings from their days in Arkansas. There has been much speculation as to whether Starr will indict first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
<p>Some in the White House believe it is possible that, if Republicans push too hard, they could spark popular indignation, as happened a year ago when they bore the blame for provoking two government shutdowns over the budget.</p>
<p>Clinton portrayed the Republicans as extremist and secured an advantage which contributed to his re-election.</p>
<p>"We know there are land mines out there and the Republicans may want to attack Clinton on contributions or whatever, but on the other hand that could backfire," McCurry said.</p>
