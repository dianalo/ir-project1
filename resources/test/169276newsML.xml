<p>Boris Yeltsin, apparently bouncing back from a gruelling quintuple heart bypass, resumed his full presidential authority on Wednesday after only 23 hours.</p>
<p>Kremlin spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin signed a decree at 6 a.m. (0300 GMT), taking back control of Russia's nuclear arsenal and the other powers which had been temporarily delegated to Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.</p>
<p>"He woke up and signed the decree," Yastrzhembsky said. "He surprises doctors with his good state. He feels quite well for this stage."</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin later visited Yeltsin at the Moscow Cardiology Research Centre for 15 minutes to pass on numerous good wishes and report briefly on the state of the nation, the Kremlin said. Yeltsin said he was determined to return to work soon.</p>
<p>Doctors were meeting at the Centre to review the 65-year-old president's progress and were due to issue a formal bulletin later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Surgeons, including U.S. pioneer Michael DeBakey, said soon after Tuesday's seven-hour operation that it had gone successfully and the patient was doing fine.</p>
<p>Russian cardiologist Renat Akchurin, who led the team, warned however that it might be nearly a week before doctors could estimate how quickly and fully Yeltsin would recover.</p>
<p>"Now the very important stage of post-operative treatment is starting," Akchurin said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's prolonged illness has paralysed Russia's post- communist development, damaging Western investor confidence and unleashing a new bout of political infighting in the Kremlin.</p>
<p>As the Russian newspaper Trud put it on Wednesday in its front-page headline: "The president is on the mend, what is left is to cure Russia."</p>
<p>Both the president's friends and foes in Russian politics were waiting to see whether he would take full control of the Kremlin, or become a lame duck for the remaining 3-3/4 years of his second term.</p>
<p>Russian markets rose slightly on Tuesday on news of the operation, though dealers said a successful outcome had largely already been factored into prices.</p>
<p>The power vacuum is hampering government attempts to resolve a cash-flow crisis which means millions of public and private-sector workers have not been paid for months.</p>
<p>The government also needs a strong-looking Yeltsin to convince Western investors the Russian market is safe and stable before it launches its first attempt to raise capital abroad since the 1917 revolution, probably later this month.</p>
<p>Some Western cardiologists expressed concern at the high number of bypasses performed on Yeltsin, saying that this did not bode well for his chances of avoiding further heart trouble.</p>
<p>But professor George Noon from the Bailey Medical Centre in Houston, who came to Moscow with DeBakey as a consultant, was unconcerned and expected a routine convalescence.</p>
<p>"It is not unusual to see five bypasses," he told Reuters. "The important thing is that the vessels that were diseased were all able to be bypassed and he (Yeltsin) has done very well."</p>
<p>"It was very standard and everything went in a very routine manner without complications," he said.</p>
<p>"The vessels that were diseased were bypassed and it ended up with the number five," Noon said, adding that a couple of Yeltsin's arteries had sections which were completely blocked.</p>
<p>However the high number of bypasses would make no difference to the speed of recovery now that the blood supply to the heart had been restored. "He (Yeltsin) has really responded well and is doing fine."</p>
<p>If all goes well Yeltsin could leave the Cardiology Research Centre in 10 days or so.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky said Yeltsin had received invitations to convalesce in Germany and in Slovakia and would decide in due course with his doctors whether to accept.</p>
<p>For a Russian leader to convalesce abroad would mark a sharp departure from Kremlin tradition. But doctors might favour the idea if it prevented Yeltsin from returning to work too soon.</p>
