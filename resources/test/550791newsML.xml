<p>The United States on Wednesday condemned an assassination attempt on the president of Tajikistan but said it should not derail negotations aimed at a national reconciliation.</p>
<p>Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov was wounded earlier on Wednesday by a hand grenade thrown at his feet as he got out of a car during a visit to the northern town of Khudjand. Two people were killed and 60 injured in the attack.</p>
<p>Rakhmonov was hit in the legs, but a presidential spokesman said his health was not endangered.</p>
<p>"The State Department condemns the terrorist attack on Tajikistan's President Rakhmonov and other government officials that took place in the northern city of Khudjand today," department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a briefing.</p>
<p>"We see no reason why this incident should have any detrimental effect on the peace negotiations in Tajikistan," Burns said. "The inter-Tajik negotiations have come a long way and they now stand on the threshold of a successful national reconciliation."</p>
<p>Tajikistan is reeling from a four-year-old civil war in which tens of thousands of people have been killed. Armed groups still roam the mountain state, which borders Afghanistan and China.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Tajikistan's armed Islamic opposition, Rakhmonov's main foe in the civil war, told Reuters the group had no connection with the attack.</p>
