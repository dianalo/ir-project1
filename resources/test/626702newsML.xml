<p>Taiwan's 200,000-barrel-per-day Taoyuan refinery does not currently expect to import oil products to cover losses from a fire-damaged unit, an official from the Chinese Petroleum Corp (CPC) said on Friday.</p>
<p>However, much will depend on how long the residue hydro-sulphuriser, damaged by fire and an explosion late on Thursday, will be down.</p>
<p>The 15,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) unit, which cuts fuel oil sulphur content to 0.5 percent, was due to restart operations on Thursday after a routine annual maintenance when it was struck by the fire and explosion. The maintenance began in early May.  </p>
<p>The official said the damage to the unit was not very serious but CPC must delay the restart in order to conduct safety checks as required by the government.</p>
<p>Other CPC officials had estimated that the damaged unit's restart could be delayed for up to one month.</p>
<p>The official said Taiwan has four other residue hydro-desulphurisers. Taoyuan has one other similar unit, with a capacity of 30,000 bpd.</p>
<p>Taiwan's only other refinery, the 570,000-bpd Kaohsiung complex, has three residue hydro-desulphurisers, each with a capacity of 30,000 bpd.  </p>
<p>Officials said the units would be able to cover for any shortages during the delay in the restart.</p>
<p>"The refinery is still evaluating the impact to (fuel oil) production and so far there has been no call for purchasing requirements from the refinery," the official said.</p>
<p>CPC currently has a tender to buy two 38,000-tonne cargoes of 0.5-percent sulphur fuel oil for July deliveries, which was issued on May 28, a day before the fire occurred. The tender closes on June 4 and is valid for two days.</p>
<p>The official said the delay would not have much impact on output of other products.  </p>
<p>Swaps fuel oil prices in Singapore gained about 75 cents for June to be quoted at $100.50/$101.00 per tonne, while July gained $1.25 at $99.50/$100.25.</p>
<p>But traders said the firmer tone was due to higher bids by a Singapore trader rather than the fire at Taoyuan which was largely ignored.</p>
