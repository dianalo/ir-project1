<p>German chemicals employers and unions on Tuesday started talks to solve a dispute on possible sick pay cuts, which threatens to disrupt the normally good relations in the industry.</p>
<p>The talks will form part of the overall 1997 wage round for the 590,000 employees in the west German chemical sector. Wider wage talks have been brought forward to give more scope for negotiation on sick pay and other issues.</p>
<p>Before the talks, a spokesman for the IG Chemie trade union revealed for the first time its wage demand for 1997, saying negotiators would be going into the talks seeking a 4.2 percent overall rise in wages.</p>
<p>Such a claim would reflect productivity growth of 2.7 percent in the industry and an estimated 1.5 percent rate of inflation, the IG Chemie spokesman said.</p>
<p>Both IG Chemie and DAG, the white-collar workers union, stressed that they would be seeking to retain full sick pay entitlements, which under a new law would be cut to 80 percent of salary from 100 percent.</p>
<p>"An agreement over full sick pay is of particular importance to us in this wage round," DAG chief negotiator Uwe Gudowius said in a statement.</p>
<p>Wage contracts in the chemicals industry do not specifically protect sick pay at 100 percent of salary in the same way that metal and engineering unions argue wage contracts in their sectors do.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, a recent attempt by BASF AG, Germany's largest chemical groups, to implement the cuts led to mass protests from its workers in an industry that normally prides itself on being able swiftly to come to agreements between employers and workers.</p>
<p>IG Chemie said it was willing to consider reductions in holiday bonuses in an overall agreement as long as full sick pay entitlements were secured.</p>
<p>The German chemical employers association, the BAVC, said last month that companies would have to decide for themselves whether they would implement the sick pay cuts until a sector-wide agreement could be found.</p>
<p>IG Chemie said late last month that it knew of no large company that had so far sought to put the new law into effect.</p>
