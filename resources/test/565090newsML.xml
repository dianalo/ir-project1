<p>The Republican chairmen of the congressional tax-writing committees said Wednesday they would propose setting May 7, 1997, as the effective date for a capital gains tax cut.</p>
<p>"We intend to propose that the effective date for any capital gains tax cut included in the budget reconciliation bill will be with respect to sales and exchanges occurring on or after today," according to a joint statement from House Ways and Means Committee chairman Bill Archer of Texas and Senate Finance Committee chairman William Roth of Delaware.  </p>
<p>A capital gains tax cut is expected to be part of a tax package this year and was included in a broad outline of a budget agreement reached Friday between congressional leaders and the White House.</p>
<p>Specific details of a capital gains tax cut have yet to be worked out. Republicans have said a tax cut on profits made on investments is one of their priorities this year.</p>
