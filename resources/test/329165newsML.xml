<p>Texaco Inc is taking steps to reduce exploration risks and expects to increase oil production over the next five years, a company official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A move to allowing only for a minimum 20 percent chance of success in exploration activities covering 70 percent of exploration has been implemented at the oil company, Bruce Appelbaum, president of Texaco International Exploration, said</p>
<p>"It makes us concentrate on things that can deliver," Appelbaum said in an interview.  </p>
<p>He said Texaco has had had only "very limited success in frontier exploration."</p>
<p>Under the move, Texaco will turn its exploration focus away from low-success countries in favour of higher potential regions, which include West Africa, Kazakhstan, the North Sea, China and Australia's offshore North West Shelf, Appelbaum said.</p>
<p>Between 1997 and 2001, production on an oil equivalent basis will grow five percent annually in North America and 14 percent internationally to 1.742 million barrels a day, Appelbaum said.  </p>
<p>The figures do not take into account the gas-rich Gorgon field offshore Western Australia, which if developed would roughly double Texaco's worldwide gas reserves, Appelbaum said.</p>
<p>Texaco holds an interest in Gorgon through the West Australian Petroleum Pty Ltd (WAPET) consortium. The field is estimated to contain 33 trillion cubic feet of gas.</p>
<p>WAPET is a joint venture of Texaco, Chevron Inc and Royal Dutch/Shell Group, each with two-sevenths stakes, and Mobil Corp, with one-seventh.</p>
<p>Appelbaum earlier on Thursday said it was hoped Gorgon could be developed, starting around 2002.  </p>
<p>He told the Australasian Energy Pacesetter 1997 conference in Sydney an outstanding issue was whether to join the neighbouring North West Shelf gas project, already in production, or to develop Gorgon separately.</p>
<p>"Whatever we decide, we believe the time frame is 2002 to 2005 to get this project producing, it will virtually double Texaco's worlwide gas reserves," Applebaum said.</p>
<p>Equal partners in the North West Shelf project are units of The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd, The British Petroleum Co Plc, Japan Australia LNG (MiMi) Pty Ltd, a partnership of Mitsui &amp; Co Ltd and Mitsubishi Corp, Chevron,  </p>
