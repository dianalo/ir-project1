<p>A huge cheer erupted in the newsroom of the Seattle Times shortly after 12 noon Monday when Washington state's largest newspaper learned it had won its sixth Pulitzer prize.</p>
<p>A few minutes later another cheer went up when the newspaper won its seventh.</p>
<p>"It was wild pandemonium," said business editor Rob Weisman.</p>
<p>For any but the nation's largest newspapers it is virtually unheard of to win more than one Pulitzer in a year, but the Seattle Times this year won in two prestigious categories  -- investigative reporting and beat reporting.</p>
<p>"We had two very competitive candidates, but the odds against winning two in a single year are so astronomical there's simply no way you can get your hopes up for something like that," said executive editor Mike Fancher.</p>
<p>With a daily circulation of 235,000, the Seattle Times barely ranks among the nation's 50 biggest newspapers.</p>
<p>The Pulitzer judges cited the Times for its series exploring corruption in a federally subsidised housing programme for native Americans and for beat reporter Byron Acohido's investigation of rudder control problems on the Boeing 737, the world's most widely used airplane.</p>
<p>Shortly after the series was published the Federal Aviation Administration called for inspection of all U.S.-based models for any possible jamming of rudder parts, and Boeing announced it was working on a modification.</p>
<p>Throughout his investigation, Acohido encountered what Fancher called a "very hostile reaction" from Boeing, the region's dominant employer.</p>
<p>At one point the company issued a statement saying it refused to cooperate with Acohido because "we have lost all confidence that he is capable of objective reporting when it comes to Boeing."</p>
<p>"In terms of access to Boeing they've treated me consistently, which means minimum access," Acohido said. "There are other ways of getting information."</p>
<p>The Pulitzer was the second for Times reporter Eric Nalder, who was part of the investigative team that also included Deborah Nelson and Alex Tizon.</p>
<p>Their report on inequities in subsidised Indian housing led to congressional hearings and proposals to change the law governing the programme.</p>
<p>"In both stories the immediate aftermath was that things changed, and that's what good journalism is about," Fancher said.</p>
<p>Nalder also was part of the team that won the newspaper's last Pulitzer in 1990 for its coverage of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska.</p>
