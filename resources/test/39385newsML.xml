<p>Public rallies and marches were held in Pakistan-controlled Azad (free) Kashmir on Saturday to protest at controversial state assembly elections in the Indian-ruled part of the disputed Himalayan region.</p>
<p>Indian and Pakistan troops also exchanged mortar and machinegun fire across a military control line dividing the region for the second successive day raising tension in the area, Pakistani officials said.</p>
<p>At least one person was killed and two were injured by Indian shelling at the Pakistan-held town of Athmuqam in Neelum Valley northeast of the state capital Muzaffarabad.</p>
<p>"We are forced to retaliate," a Pakistani official said.</p>
<p>Azad Kashmir leader Sultan Mahmood led hundreds of marchers to a U.N. military observers' office in Muzaffarabad to hand a memorandum protesting against the elections and calling for holding a U.N.-mandated plebiscite in Kashmir.</p>
<p>Among the placards carried by the marchers were "No to election, no to selection, yes to liberation", and "Election is no substitute for the right to self-determination".</p>
<p>Similar rallies were held at other towns in Azad Kashmir and in the Pakistani capital Islamabad, Kashmiri sources said.</p>
<p>"Kashmiris have rejected these elections (in Indian Kashmir) and will continue their struggle until freedom," Mahmood said in a speech to Muzaffarabad protesters.</p>
<p>Indian rules two-thirds and Pakistan the remaining third of Kashmir, over which the two countries have fought two of their three wars since their independence from Britain in 1947.</p>
<p>Pakistan denies Indian charges that it is training and arming Kashmiri militants fighting New Delhi rule.</p>
<p>Islamabad opposes elections in Indian Kashmir, saying the predominantly Moslem Kashmiris must decide whether to join Islamic Pakistan or Hindu-majority India.</p>
