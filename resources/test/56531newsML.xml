<p>IRA guerrillas may be moving towards a new ceasefire, Irish media reports said on Monday, but their Sinn Fein political wing ruled out an early truce and pro-British Protestants said they were sceptical.</p>
<p>Irish newspapers predicted peace moves by the outlawed Irish Republican Army (IRA) that has fought to end British rule of Northern Ireland for 25 years and broke a 17-month truce in February.</p>
<p>Quoting security sources, press reports said the leadership of the IRA may be planning a special secret convention to consider restoring the truce.</p>
<p>"IRA's top command structure may call a ceasefire," the Irish Times said supporting British newspaper reports that the guerrillas are planning a secret conference to decide strategy.</p>
<p>The Irish Independent, also published in Dublin, said senior police officers in the Irish capital believe that most of the IRA's leaders favour reinstating the ceasefire.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein's chief stategist, Martin McGuinness, said he had no knowledge of the guerrillas' intentions.</p>
<p>Accusing Britain of "dogged intransigence", McGuinness said in radio interviews that there was little prospect of an IRA ceasefire before Britain brings Sinn Fein into talks on a permanent political solution for the province.</p>
<p>"I think that anyone who thinks that it (an imminent truce) is likely -- given the events of the past two years -- is living in cloud cookoo land," he said on BBC radio.</p>
<p>The IRA launched a bombing campaign in February in mainland Britain but it has not set an attack since June 15.</p>
<p>The powerful Protestant Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) accused London and Dublin of creating false impressions to pave the way for Sinn Fein to join multi-party talks under way in Belfast. Sinn Fein is barred because the IRA refuses to end hostilities.</p>
<p>UUP politician Jeffrey Donaldson, who wants the British presence in Northern Ireland to remain, insisted there must be a permanent end to violence before Sinn Fein could be considered for a talks seat.</p>
<p>"I am not sure that we are going to see that," he said on his way into the talks, launched in June under the chairmanship of former U.S. senator George Mitchell.</p>
<p>Nigel Dodds of the Democratic Unionst Party said: "Any announcement from the IRA will be viewed with the greatest degree of scepticism possible by Unionists, who (have) heard it all before."</p>
<p>McGuinness put the onus for a positive move by the IRA on the British government.</p>
<p>"On this occasion, I believe it is absolutely essential, if there is to be any hope whatsoever of gaining a second IRA cessation that the British government must move...to put in place the process of real, meaningful negotiations."</p>
<p>According to the Irish media, recent setbacks including explosives siezures have fuelled a new mood which is swinging support behind the "peace strategy" spearheaded by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, and his chief lieutenant McGuinness.</p>
<p>Irish Prime Minister John Bruton caused puzzlement at home when he said during a trip to the United States last week that an IRA ceasefire might be on the cards.</p>
<p>The Irish Times reported that Bruton had been briefed by security chiefs that "there had been very clear intelligence reports of preparations for an IRA General Army Convention preceding a ceasefire".</p>
