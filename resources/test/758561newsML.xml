<p>Nigerian journalist Mohammed Adamu was detained by security agents on Sunday after writing a recent article critical of military ruler General Sani Abacha's security chief, colleagues said.</p>
<p>The colleagues said Adamu was picked up by three security men from his house in a suburb of the capital Abuja at about 3.20 p.m. (1420 GMT).</p>
<p>"They said they had come from the presidency," one colleague said.</p>
<p>In the July 14 edition of Concord magazine, one of several publications owned by detained presidential claimant Moshood Abiola, Adamu wrote an article under the title "(Hamza) Mustapha - ruthless man behind Abacha".</p>
<p>Mustapha is the head of security at the presidency.</p>
<p>Nigeria holds dozens of political prisoners -- a major sticking point in relations with Western countries, which accuse the military government of human rights abuses and insincerity in its plan to restore civilian rule in 1998.</p>
