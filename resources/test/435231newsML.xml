<p>NYCE cotton futures closed sharply lower amid mixed late-session selling as a steep drop in soybean futures added pressure, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Cotton futures fell to their lows just before the close as the funds joined the trade and some locals in liquidating long positions, traders said.</p>
<p>The move down filled a gap on the charts between 76.30 and 76.10 cents basis May.</p>
<p>"The locals went short in search of stops under the market, the specs jumped on the bandwagon and then beans went down," a trader said.</p>
<p>Most-active May cotton eased 1.50 cents to close at 76.15 cents a lb, having ranged from 77.35 to 76.00 cents. The back months finished 1.28 to 0.25 lower.</p>
<p>Volume reached an estimated 18,000 lots compared to Tuesday's official 20,037 lots.</p>
<p>Nearby support basis May was seen at 76.00 and then at 75.75, slightly below the 40-day moving average of 75.77.</p>
<p>Additional losses are anticipated as the market remains in a technically precarious position.</p>
<p>Analysts noted that the speculators hold a hefty net long position. Monday's runup to the recent high of 78.25 cents in May amid record volume of 33,291 lots, they said, could set the market up for a steep fall.</p>
<p>Fundamental pressure will come from Tuesday's revised estimate for U.S. exports. The U.S. Department of Agriculture raised exports to 6.8 million bales from its previous forecast of 6.5 million bales.</p>
<p>But prices are likely to retreat if the U.S. is to reach its new export target. "We entirely shut off export enquiries over 76.00 cents," the trader said.</p>
<p>O.A. Cleveland, a cotton marketing specialist with Mississippi State University, said that flooding in the mid-South could ultimately lift prices in the longer term if growers are unable to plant cotton.</p>
<p>The market may have a better idea of the 1997/98 crop potential after the USDA issues its first official estimate of planted cotton area, on March 31.</p>
<p>Signs that the U.S. may be importing soybeans from Brazil prompted a fall in CBOT soybeans futures.</p>
