<p>German electronics giant Siemens AG said on Thursday weak semiconductor prices at the end of 1996 caused net income in the first quarter of its fiscal year to fall, but it still sees stable full-year profits.</p>
<p>Net income in the final three months of 1996, the first quarter of Siemens business year to September 30, 1997, fell five percent to 478 million marks ($284.4 million), despite strong growth in orders during the same period.  </p>
<p>Favourable foreign exchange markets and low German interest rates boosted Siemens orders and sales in the first quarter. Incoming orders rose 22 percent to 27 billion marks and sales were up six percent to 20.9 billion marks.</p>
<p>The highest growth was achieved in the Asia-Pacific region, where orders surged 130 percent, and in the Americas, where orders grew 37 percent.</p>
<p>"Strong growth in the first quarter was due to special factors and should not be extrapolated for the entire year," said Siemens chairman Heinrich von Pierer, but said he remained confident for earnings in the full year.</p>
<p>"In the past three years we continually improved out results. We will reach last year's high 2.5 billion marks level again this year. And next year, we anticipate another increase," he said in a statement released ahead of the annual general meeting of shareholders in Berlin.</p>
