<headline>Dean Witter exec sees cost savings in Morgan deal.</headline>

<p>Dean Witter, Discover &amp; Co Chairman and Chief Executive Philip Purcell said Wednesday "there will be cost savings" in the planned merger with Morgan Stanley Group Inc, but he declined to give details.</p>
<p>He told a news conference that cost savings were not the main purpose of the transaction.</p>
<p>Morgan Chairman Richard Fisher told the news conference that the purposes of the merger included opportunities to enhance revenues, diversify sources of earnings, and increase efficiencies in capital management.  </p>
<p>Fisher said he put consolidation savings as a fourth priority, but added, "We will pursue them aggressively."</p>
<p>In response to a question, Morgan President John Mack said of Dean Witter's Discover credit card unit, "We love the business."</p>
<p>The three executives stressed that the merger was a great opportunity for Morgan to increase its underwriting abilities through the retail distribution network of Dean Witter.  </p>
<p>Purcell said he expected the merger to be accretive to all shareholders. He did not give details.</p>
<p>Mack said the merged companies would record "accelerated" profit and revenue growth. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>The companies said that together, their 1996 revenues totalled just over $12 billion. Net income available to common shares was $1.91 billion, and pre-tax income was $3 billion.</p>
<p>The merged companies would rank fifth globally with $271 billion in assets under management, "which puts us ahead of all the securities firms," Purcell said.  </p>
<p>He said asset management growth was an important aspect of the merger.</p>
<p>"It is a $10 trillion business, and growing. It is high margin, uses little capital, and has high returns," Purcell said.</p>
<p>He said he expected the combination of the asset management and credit card businesses to add balance and stability to the merged companies' profit picture.</p>
<p>Purcell was optimistic about the Discover card business, saying he expected it to be a global leader.  </p>
<p>The executives provided no details about cost savings and did not say whether there would be layoffs.</p>
<p>"The message we are giving is not a message of cost savings. It is about growth, enhanced margins and better products," said Purcell.</p>
<p>The executives declined to detail how the different corporate cultures of the two firms would be combined, but Mack said mergers are "successful from the top."</p>
<p>At the news conference, the rapport among the three executives appeared good.  </p>
<p>Mack said that because there was "no weakness" in either company, the merger was likely to work well, unlike past, less successful mergers in the financial services industry.</p>
<p>Discussing the use of the credit card business to increase other business, Mack said, "More and more financial services will be done electronically," referring to the merged companies' vast product offerings.</p>
<p>He said there are 37 million Discover cardholders, a ready, easily reached market for financial products.</p>
