<p>A Somali Moslem fundamentalist group said on Saturday that 5,000 men had registered to join a "jihad" or holy war against Ethiopian troops in southwestern Somalia.</p>
<p>Mukhtar Sheikh Hamud, a spokesman for al-Ittihad al-Islamic (Islamic Unity) movement, said more than 3,000 of the volunteers were from Mogadishu and large amounts of cash had been donated for the fighters.</p>
<p>He told reporters some of the volunteers had already left for the frontlines in the southwest and others would soon go.</p>
<p>Moslem clerics at Friday prayers at mosques in the capital called for volunteers to fight, saying they would reach paradise if they were killed fighting to expel Ethiopian forces that thrust into southwestern Somalia on Tuesday last week.</p>
<p>Security sources in Mogadishu reported sporadic shooting and shelling between Ethiopian forces and al-Ittihad in a border village on Friday.</p>
<p>South Mogadishu faction leader Hussein Aideed on Thursday urged Ethiopian to withdraw its forces but stopped short of expressing support for the Moslem fundamentalist al-Ittihad.</p>
<p>It was the second time in five months Ethiopia sent troops into Somalia to strike at al-Ittihad. Last August Ethiopia said its forces killed more than 230 fighters and destroyed three bases.</p>
<p>Ethiopia said then it might have to return to hit again at what it called a "multinational terrorist group" in Somalia. Ethiopia says Moslem fundamentalists based in Somalia were responsible for a series of bomb blasts and attacks in Ethopia earlier this year.</p>
