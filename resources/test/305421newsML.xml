<p>Hungary's record breaking bourse looks set to make further strides this year, but the BUX index will probably meet resistance at 5,000 points, the Budapest Stock Exchange's (BSE) chief executive said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Unless interest rates rise substantially on foreign markets and provided there are no dramatic shifts in Hungarian economic policy...the index will certainly stabilise at between 4,000 and 5,000 points," Jozsef Rotyis said in an interview.</p>
<p>"(To reach) 6,000 or 7,000 points...would require very, very good circumstances."</p>
<p>The BUX index which finished 1996 at 4,134.31 points, compared to 1,528.92 points at the end of 1995, ended at a record 4,742.70 points on Monday.</p>
<p>But Rotyis forecast that Hungarian stocks would not manage to match last year's rise.</p>
<p>"To achieve this, the index would have to reach 8,000 points...this could only happen if the government brought everything (all companies) onto the bourse immediately, privatised them and reformed the social security system."</p>
<p>Certain companies may match last year's pace, said Rotyis, adding the market was still undervalued.</p>
<p>The market was based on solid domestic economic fundamentals, meaning any halt to the rising trend would be caused mainly by changes abroad.</p>
<p>However, Rotyis said some domestic factors could affect the bourse's outlook, such as the number of new companies to be floated. He did not expect more than five to 10 this year.</p>
<p>Another decisive factor would be preliminary 1996 annual results to be published by mid-February.</p>
<p>Speaking about the BSE's short-term development plans Rotyis said the bourse was considering setting up a so-called third market in addition to the current "listed A" and "listed B" categories.</p>
<p>"Listed A" shares require stricter reporting requirements than B shares, while a new third market would include smaller and probably less liquid companies.</p>
<p>"We would like to have more companies listed but we have to find some sort of compromise between our rules and issuers's demands," Rotyis said. "The issue will certainly be on the agenda in the first quarter of the year."</p>
<p>The bourse expects to shift to a continuous calculation of the BUX index later this month from the current once-a-day system, and will allow foreigners onto the BUX futures markets on January 24.</p>
<p>"There may be an initial rush of investors," Rotyis said, adding that the underlying market's current bullish trend may enhance this. "I expect (higher) volume rather than a large number of deals."</p>
<p>Plans to develop the bourse's derivatives market include the launch of futures contracts for the Central European Share Index (CESI) and the launch of options markets in the summer.</p>
<p>"(Regarding the CESI) a number of questions, such as the choice between dollar or forint quotation, are yet to be answered," Rotyis said.</p>
<p>The CESI index, which reflects the price movements of 73 selected Polish, Czech, Hungarian, Slovak and Slovenian stocks, is calculated in dollar terms and is published by the BSE.</p>
