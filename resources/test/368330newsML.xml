<p>Shares in Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd climbed on Monday morning, reaching a high for the financial year.</p>
<p>The share price of the pharmaceutical manufacturer rose 50 yen to 2,460 yen by 0122 GMT. It briefly touched 2,470 yen, a new high for the financial year.</p>
<p>The volume of 1.066 million shares ranked as the second heaviest on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>Brokers said volatile foreign exchange movements had sent investors looking for shares such as those in the pharmaceutical maker that were relatively immune to currency gyrations.</p>
<p>"Since the currency market is volatile, drug makers attract investors as a defensive stock, and Takeda is a major issue in the sector," said a trader at a major Japanese securities house.</p>
