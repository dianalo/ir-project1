<p>U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisers on Thursday said women should avoid pregnancy for three years after using Roche Holding Ltd's psoriasis drug acetretin (Soriatane).</p>
<p>The panel recommended that the drug be labeled to warn women of childbearing age to avoid conceiving for "at least three years" after stopping the therapy.</p>
<p>Panel chairman Dr. Joseph McGuire of Stanford University said that the label should warn physicians and patients that if acetretin is given during pregnancy, there is "very likely to be adverse events."</p>
<p>The FDA usually follows the panel's advice, although it is not binding.</p>
<p>FDA had pushed for a wait period of "at least three years." Roche lobbied FDA for two years -- the same warning the drug carries overseas.</p>
<p>One-to-two million Americans have psoriasis, a painful skin condition that causes itchy, scaling patches, although not everyone has symptoms requiring this drug.</p>
<p>Acetretin was approved in the United States in October 1996, but it has not been sold here yet.  It is available in 24 countries.</p>
<p>It was developed to replace Roche's etretinate and the FDA said it would propose removing the older drug from the market once acetretin is available. Roche is already withdrawing etretinate in overseas markets where the new drug is available.</p>
