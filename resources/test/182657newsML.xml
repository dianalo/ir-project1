<headline>U.S. High Court rejects appeals on Whitewater fines.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1996-11-12</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Supreme Court Tuesday rejected appeals by two former associates of President Clinton who each were fined $77,000 for refusing to turn over documents subpoenaed by the Whitewater special prosecutor.</p>
<p>Herby Branscum and Robert Hill, who later were cleared of the criminal charges against them, challenged the authority of Whitewater special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, but the high court denied their appeals without comment or dissent.</p>
<p>Branscum and Hill had been ordered to turn over the documents in July 1995 but did not comply until five months later after running up $1,000-a-day contempt-of-court fines.</p>
<p>They were indicted in February on charges of converting funds from a rural Arkansas bank they owned to campaign contributions, with $13,000 funnelled to Clinton's 1990 reelection race for governor of Arkansas.</p>
<p>They also were accused of failing to report to federal authorities large cash withdrawals by Clinton campaign officials from an account they maintained at their Bank of Perry County in Arkansas.</p>
<p>A jury in August found them not guilty on the four most serious counts and could not reach a verdict on the remaining seven counts. Starr decided to drop the remaining charges rather than seek a retrial.</p>
