<p>Austrian privatisation candidate Creditanstalt on Thursday reported what might be its last set of profit figures before losing its independence in the imminent sale of the state's controlling stake in the flagship bank.</p>
<p>According to preliminary figures, Creditanstalt increased 1996 group net earnings to 2.6 billion schillings ($235 million) from 2.166 billion a year earlier, helped by a nine-percent decline in risk provisions to about 3.1 billion schillings.</p>
<p>"Despite all of our problems, the development of the bank's results is quite positive overall," chief executive Guido Schmidt-Chiari told a news conference.</p>
<p>The pending sale of the state's 70 percent voting stake in Creditanstalt has turned into a fierce political battle which has deeply divided an already uneasy government coalition of Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party.</p>
<p>The dominant Social Democrats want to sell the bank, considered to be a conservative stronghold, to arch-rival Bank Austria, while the People's Party prefers a sale to an international group led by insurer EA-Generali.</p>
<p>Bidders have been given a final deadline to improve their offers by Friday. EA-Generali said late on Wednesday it had increased its bid from an original 13.8 billion schillings for most of the stake but declined to say by how much.</p>
<p>Bank Austria, which sources close to the negotiations have tipped as the most likely winner in the privatisation battle, has offered 16.8 billion schillings for its main competitor.</p>
<p>Bank Austria's supervisory board was due to meet later on Thursday to consider adjustments to its own offer.</p>
<p>Schmidt-Chiari reiterated the bank's own strong opposition to a takeover by its main rival, saying that such a step could hurt Creditanstalt's share price.</p>
<p>The conservatives have backed Creditanstalt, saying they would strictly oppose a sale of the blue-blooded finance house to Bank Austria, which is effectively controlled by the Social Democratic City of Vienna council.</p>
<p>But embattled Schmidt-Chiari denied that his bank was a conservative stronghold. "Creditanstalt is not the bulwark of any political party," he said.</p>
<p>The chief executive has supported a union-led campaign against the bank's possible takeover by Bank Austria.</p>
<p>Employees fear that the bank's 9,800-strong workforce will bear the brunt of job cuts if the country's two biggest banks merge, since Bank Austria's employees are protected by a quirk of Austrian law which effectively puts them in the same category as civil servants.</p>
<p>Observers expect Social Democrat Finance Minister Viktor Klima to announce his choice of a buyer for the state's stake in Creditanstalt before or over the weekend.</p>
<p>Sources close to the EA-Generali-led group have already indicated that they consider their chances of taking control of the one-time banker to the Austro-Hungarian emperors as slim, even if it managed to come close to Bank Austria's offer. ($1=11.05 Schilling)</p>
