<p>India's largest truck-maker, Tata Engineering and Locomotive Company Ltd (TELCO), expects to overcome a first quarter slowdown and boost sales by 10-12 percent in 1997/98 (April-March), its chief said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Slowdown in industrial activity is usually a 12-month cycle," chairman Ratan Tata said, adding that he expected the Indian economy to show signs of revival during the second half of 1997/98.</p>
<p>Indian industrial production in 1996/97 (April-March) grew only 6.7 percent against 11.6 percent in 1995/96, official figures show.</p>
<p>Despite signs of deceleration in 1996/97, the economic scene showed some positive trends that would accelerate growth in 1997/98, India's central bank said last week.</p>
<p>The government said India's index of industrial production rose 9.8 percent in April compared with the same month in 1996.</p>
<p>"Certainly, no company can grow every year at the same pace," Tata said, in reply to a shareholder's query. "Some years may be good while some may turn out to be bad."</p>
<p>TELCO beat market expectations with a whopping 44 percent surge in net profit for the year ended March 31, 1997 to 7.62 billion rupees, from 5.3 billion the previous year.</p>
<p>Sales in the first quarter ended June 30 at 18.80 billion rupees, lower by more than 10 percent over the same period last year, he said.</p>
<p>Exports fell 38 percent to $17.74 million in the quarter, but the firm's construction equipment business grew 35 percent.</p>
<p>"The market has been quite tough since the second half of last year (1996/97) and it continues in the first half of 1997/98," Tata said.</p>
<p>"Infrastructure projects are starting to take place and some kind of uptrend in economic activity can be expected."</p>
<p>TELCO will spend 45 billion rupees in its projected capital expenditure plan over the next three years, Tata said.</p>
<p>He said TELCO had earmarked 17.0 billion rupees of these funds for a small car project.</p>
<p>Tata said about 55 percent of the 45 billion rupees would be raised through internal accruals and the rest by borrowings.</p>
<p>TELCO plans to launch a small car, tentatively christened the "Indicar", to take on the Maruti 800, India's largest selling car, produced by Maruti Udyog, a joint venture of Suzuki Motor Co. of Japan and the Indian government.</p>
<p>Small car production is expected to begin by the end of 1998. It will make 150,000 units per year at full capacity.</p>
<p>Tata said he expected the Indian small car market size to be 600,000 to 700,000 a year by the year 2000.</p>
<p>The total Indian car market is expected to grow to between 800,000 and one million by 2000, he said.</p>
