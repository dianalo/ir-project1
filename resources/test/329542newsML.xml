<p>Iraq has exported a total of 10.1 million barrels of crude oil through its Gulf oil terminal since starting limited oil exports in mid-December, the ruling Baath party newspaper al-Thawra said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The total amount of oil exported via Mina al-Bakr terminal has reached since mid December 10,100,000 barrels," the paper said.</p>
<p>Iraq began limited oil sales on December 10 under an agreement signed with the United Nations. The deal allowed Baghdad to sell $2 billion worth of oil every six months to buy food and medicines for the Iraqi people, suffering from stringent U.N. sanctions imposed after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990.</p>
<p>The bulk of Iraq's oil exports, around 650,000 barrels per day (bpd), is pumped to international markets via Turkey and the remainder through its Gulf terminal.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a senior Iraqi oil official said Baghdad was planning to expand its oil pipeline links with its neighbours in order to increase its oil export capacity.</p>
<p>Prior to the U.N. sanctions, Iraq exported more than 2.5 million bpd.</p>
