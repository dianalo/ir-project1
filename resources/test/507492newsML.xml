<p>Shares in BPB Plc dropped to a 10-month low on Monday after analysts at ABN AMRO Hoare Govett, joint broker to the building materials company, cut earnings estimates following a meeting with BPB on Friday, sources said.</p>
<p>The stock was down 18p at 303-1/2 in moderate volume of 713,908 shares, after earlier dropping as low as 300p -- its lowest since June last year.</p>
<p>At Hoare Govett analysts repeated a "hold" rating on the stock and lowered their pre-tax profit estimate for the year ending September 1997 to 162 million stg from 175 million, market sources said.</p>
<p>For the year after, they cut to 175 million stg from 195 million.</p>
<p>The reduction in part reflected a slow recovery in European demand for paper and plasterboard products, dealers said. Analysts at Hoare Govett were not immediately available for comment.</p>
