<p>Shares in soon-to-be-floated German telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom traded 11.66 percent above the top end of the initial price range on the last day of "grey market" trade on Friday, dealers said.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom shares were trading at around 33.50 marks ($22.22) in the grey market on Friday. The initial price range for the share is put between 25 and 30 marks.</p>
<p>"Trade is very quiet in the grey market today, nearly nothing doing, because (official) trade kicks off on Monday," said a trader at the brokerage Ballmaier &amp; Schulz in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>The grey market refers to the market provided by brokers prior to a formal offering which is not subject to official controls. Shares are sold ahead of the offering and the contracts are honoured when the IPO officially takes place.</p>
<p>The final price for the share issue will be set on Sunday November 17, with trade to start the day after. Telekom will float up to 600 million shares, with another 90 million shares in an optional overallotment, or "greenshoe".</p>
<p>"We saw larger volumes on Thursday as investors sought to get in before the deadline for the end of registration, but volumes have been a bit lower since then," a trader at the Uto Baader brokerage in Munich said.</p>
<p>Registration for Deutsche Telekom shares officially ended at 1300 GMT on Thursday. The Ballmaier &amp; Schulz broker said there was a little interest prior to the deadline, but said volumes have been limited in recent days.</p>
<p>"The demand came from a mix of foreign and domestic investors, but there has been less interest in the last few days," said the Baader trader.</p>
<p>Dealers said that trade on the grey market is a useful guideline and that they pay attention to the share price as a price guide.</p>
<p>Dealers said Telekom shares had traded as high as 34.90 marks in grey trade, a premium of sixteen percent on the upper end of the share price range for the IPO.</p>
<p>Trade on the grey market in Telekom shares saw quite high volumes early on, but was limited by the fact that members of the syndicate behind the flotation, which includes the majority of German banks and their subsidiaries, are restricted from trading on the grey market.</p>
