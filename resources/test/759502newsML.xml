<p>The Pioneer First Polish Trust Fund Company started selling units on Monday in a new fund investing in units, fund shares and firms in Poland's National Investment Fund (NFI) scheme, Pioneer officials said.</p>
<p>Piotr Rzezniczak, the managing director of the new fund, said it would invest 90 percent of its assets in NFI-related instruments or non-public firms and 10 percent in 13-week treasury bills.</p>
<p>"The investment risk will be at a fairly high level in the fund," Rzezniczak told a news conference.</p>
<p>An initial minimum investment in the fund is 100 zlotys.</p>
<p>Pioneer's deputy head Ronald Nawrocki said the company had invested 650,000 zlotys in the new fund as start-up capital.</p>
<p>The new fund is Pioneer's fourth. One of its existing funds invests mainly in treasuries, another mostly in stocks and a third has a balanced portfolio.</p>
<p>The debt-instruments fund has brought a 46.5-percent profit since its launch in June 1995, the aggressive fund increased the value of its unit by 95.7 percent in the last 19 months while the oldest, the balanced fund, showed a 654 percent profit in the five years since its creation.</p>
