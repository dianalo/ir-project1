<p>U.S. giant General Electric Co said on Wednesday that it saw Indonesia as the lynchpin of its southeast Asian operations and planned a major increase in its presence there by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>"We continue to be impressed with the progress of the Indonesian economy. The investment policies continue to liberalise," Stuart Dean, president of General Electric Indonesia, told a news conference.</p>
<p>"If you look at the economic growth in combination with the declining inflation rate, Indonesia perhaps has the best economic components in ASEAN this year," Dean said while announcing a new joint venture between General Electric Lighting Indonesia and local firm PT Sinar Baru Electric.</p>
<p>Paul Morse, who will head the new venture, PT GE Lighting Indonesia, said that the company was already using Indonesia as a base from which to serve the consumer market in ASEAN, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and planned to expand this role in the future.</p>
<p>"Our strategy is for our Indonesian business to serve the rest of ASEAN as well as Australia and already to date we have been shipping to those countries," said Morse.</p>
<p>ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>As well as lighting, Dean said he hoped that all twelve of General Electric's core businesses would have investments in Indonesia by the turn of the century.</p>
<p>"At the moment only six of our units have investments here. By the end of the century, I hope all 12 can be invested," Dean said.</p>
<p>"We are very bullish on Indonesia's long-term economics and anticipate being a bigger player in the future," he added.</p>
<p>When asked about riots in Jakarta in July, seen by many analysts as a deterrent to investing in the country, Dean said he was unperturbed.</p>
<p>"In developing countries there are going to be some bumps along the road in their development," he said</p>
<p>"But if you are a long-term global player, you need to be in the (world's) fourth-most populous country that is growing at 8 percent a year...that is seeing a middle class of 30-40 million people growing at 15-20 percent a year."</p>
<p>Dean said that General Electric has been involved in Indonesia since 1950 but only recently had investment growth started to boom. Investment over the past five years was approximately $200 billion in the six businesses operating in the country, he said.</p>
<p>In industries like lighting, however, Morse conceded that General Electric had to catch up on competition. Dutch firm Philips Electronics NV is already a household name in Indonesia, whereas GE's Surabaya factory was only opened in 1994.</p>
