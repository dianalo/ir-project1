<p>A new way of measuring the AIDS virus in immune system cells in the tonsils will help researchers and doctors monitor AIDS patients and evaluate therapies, researchers said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A report on the new testing methods developed by University of Minnesota microbiologist Ashley Haase and his colleagues appears on Friday in the journal Science.</p>
<p>Other tests count the viral load in the bloodstream or count certain types of white blood cells that indicate how advanced AIDS is in a patient. But the new approach measures viral particles in two types of cells in lymphoid tissue -- on the surface of the cells that "store" the virus and inside the cells that make new virus particles.</p>
<p>Both of those cells can be reached through simple tissue collections from the tonsils.</p>
<p>The measurements combine several techniques already in use in other aspects of AIDS treatment and research. But by monitoring lymphoid cells doctors should get a better picture of what is happening during a patient's infection, not just in the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Scientists know that new combinations of anti-AIDS drugs can reduce the virus to undetectable levels in the bloodstream but they need to know more about whether there is a residue of virus in lymphoid cells and whether HIV can come back again.</p>
<p>Those questions are important in developing better treatments and in figuring out how best to use the drugs that are now available.</p>
<p>"We now have baselines to ask how effectively a therapy is working," Haase said in a statement released by the university. "This will tell us how to design and assess treatments."</p>
<p>Haase was out of the country and unavailable for further comment on Thursday.</p>
