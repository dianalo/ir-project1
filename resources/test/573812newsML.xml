<p>The dollar fell below 123.00 yen in Tokyo on Friday for the first time since April 4, traders said.  </p>
<p>One major broker said the dollar fell as low as 122.95 yen, while a bank dealer said the dollar's low was 122.92 yen.</p>
<p>The dollar slightly recovered to 123.27 yen due to purchases by Japanese importers after its fall below 123 yen.</p>
<p>Bearish sentiment towards the dollar accelerated after Thursday's comment by senior Ministry of Finance (MOF) official Eisuke Sakakibara, who said it was possible the yen could strengthen to as much as 103 yen per dollar.</p>
<p>The dollar started falling in morning trade on the back of an article in Japanese financial daily Nikkei Kinyu speculating on the chance of Japan's official discount rate being raised in July.</p>
<p>The article suggested that some in the Bank of Japan (BOJ) may be of the opinion that Japan's low interest rate policy should come to an end soon.</p>
