<headline>CME live cattle end mostly up, feeders up sharply.</headline>

<p>CME live cattle futures closed mostly higher after drifiting on both side of previous levels early. Feeder cattle closed strong and posted new contract highs on continued strong cash, traders said.</p>
<p>Live cattle closed 0.100 cent per lb lower to 0.325 higher with only June off at 63.825 cents. Feeder cattle finished 0.925 cent higher to unchanged with May up most at 73.175 cents after posting a new high of 73.250. August set a new high of 75.850 cents.</p>
<p>Live cattle slipped at times as sliding beef prices and slipping cash fed cattle prices weighed on sentiment, they said.</p>
<p>However, follow-through selling was lacking as futures already hold a large discount to cash. The expected seasonal decline in cash cattle prices when increased fed cattle supplies come to market is already reflected in June futures, they said.</p>
<p>Some traders said the snow storm in the Texas Panhandle may be supportive as it leaves feedlots muddy, but others said it would have little effect as warmer weather expected early next week should quickly dry pens.  </p>
<p>Refco, Cargill Investor Services and R.J. O'Brien sold late while buying was scattered. In live cattle options, commission houses sold August 68 calls and there was general spreading of long December 66 puts/short 70 puts on a two to one basis. Commission houses later sold June 62 puts. Volatility was unchanged to down slightly, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle futures rallied to new highs despite higher grain futures on expectations for another large gain in the CME index following recent strong cash markets, traders said.</p>
<p>The latest CME feeder cattle index was up $0.39 at $72.54 per cwt, the highest level in over two years, since February 21, 1995.</p>
<p>Strong demand for replacement feeders amid better grazing conditions in the southwest and in the central and southern Plains after recent moisture has sparked demand for feeders, sources said. Heavy death losses in the northern Plains from recent storms and flooding also buoyed cash feeder cattle prices, they said.</p>
<p>E.D.&amp; F. Man notably bought May late while Cargill Investor Services spread long October live cattle/short May feeders, traders said. Dean Witter bought August while Smith Barney and Refco sold, pit sources said.</p>
