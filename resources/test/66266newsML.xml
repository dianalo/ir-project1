<p>PureTec Corp said Friday it expects to record a one-time, fourth quarter charge of about $4.8 million, related to the shutdown of unprofitable facilities in its recycling unit.</p>
<p>These charges are in addition to $3.1 million in write-offs taken in the first half of fiscal 1996 for discontinued manufacturing operations, PureTec said.</p>
<p>PureTec said it expects its fiscal 1996 operating results will compare favorably to fiscal 1995 pro-forma operating losses of $0.70 a share.  </p>
<p>Although the charges will result in a loss for fiscal 1996, PureTec expects its operating EBITDA to be about $40 million.</p>
<p>PureTec, a leading garden hose manufacturer, said it is "poised" for earnings growth in 1997 and beyond.</p>
