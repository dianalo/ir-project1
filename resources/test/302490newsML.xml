<p>The Mauritian rupee weakened against the dollar but firmed versus the pound on Monday, forex dealers said.</p>
<p>The rupee was fixed at a mean commercial rate of 19.916 for one dollar from 19.866 last Friday. Against the pound, the rupee traded at a mean rate of 33.5035 from 33.7220 last Friday.</p>
<p>Forex dealers said although commercial banks were long in their foreign exchange positions, the softer rupee on Monday reflected the strengthening dollar in international markets.</p>
<p>"If banks were not long, that is there was not such an oversupply of foreign currencies, the rupee would have depreciated by a greater amount against the dollar today," one dealer told Reuters.</p>
<p>The dealer added that hard currency demand from importers was still relatively low but there was a good level of supply from the Indian Ocean island's textiles export and tourism sectors at this period of year.</p>
<p>Further hard currency supply to commercial banks also took place last Friday with a Mauritius Sugar Syndicate tender sale of pound obtained from Mauritius' sugar exports.</p>
<p>Sugar and textiles exports and tourism are the leading hard currency earners of Mauritius.</p>
