<p>NATO, countering Bosnian Serb allegations, said on Saturday that peacekeeping soldiers did not abuse the Red Cross symbol when they arrested a suspected war criminal in a Bosnian hospital.</p>
<p>The NATO-led Stabilisation Force (SFOR) acknowledged for the first time that British soldiers had carried a parcel bearing a Red Cross label when they arrived at a hospital in Prijedor to detain Milan Kovacevic, an indicted war criminal.</p>
<p>The soldiers announced they were making "a delivery for Kovacevic" but at no point alluded to the marking on the parcel, SFOR said in a statement issued in Sarajevo.</p>
<p>"SFOR soldiers who gained access to Prijedor hospital did not do so in disguise or by subterfuge. They were dressed and armed as SFOR soldiers," the statement said.</p>
<p>The parcel had a hand-sized Red Cross label but did not bear the symbol of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), it said.</p>
<p>NATO issued the statement in response to allegations from the head of the Bosnian Serb Red Cross, Ljiljana Karadzic, wife of the Serb political leader and indicted war criminal, Radovan Karadzic.</p>
<p>Mrs Karadzic accused SFOR of using the Red Cross symbol as a ruse to gain entry to the hospital, calling the operation a "dishonest act". She demanded the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) investigate the matter.</p>
<p>The Geneva-based humanitarian organisation, which helps victims of war, noted the divergent account of events from SFOR and from Mrs Karadzic, and said it remained committed to operating as an impartial organisation.</p>
<p>"The ICRC expresses its immediate concern about these allegations regarding the use of the Red Cross emblem," the organisation said on Friday.</p>
<p>SFOR officers said the arrest of Kovacevic was conducted professionally and without incident. He was later extradited to the Netherlands to face trial before the U.N. war crimes tribunal.</p>
<p>A second suspect, former Prijedor police chief Simo Drljaca, was shot dead when he opened fire on soldiers trying to detain him.</p>
<p>Both men were charged with participating in a genocidal campaign against Moslems and Croats in the Prijedor region early in the 1992-95 Bosnian war.</p>
