<p>Kuwait Petroleum Corp (KPC) said on Sunday it is considering boosting its Rotterdam refinery output capacity to 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) from 80,000 among other options to increase its European refining capacity.</p>
<p>"We are considering either to modernise the Rotterdam refinery to increase its capacity to 150,000 bpd or going into joint ventures with other oil firms," executive assistant managing director Mansour al-Furaih said by telephone.</p>
<p>"We are still in the study period." He did not elaborate on the envisaged joint ventures.</p>
<p>"We felt both the Rotterdam refinery and the the Denmark (Stigsnaes) refinery are old and small," he said of KPC's refining capacity in Europe.</p>
<p>KPC has said it plans to close its uncompetitive 59,000 bpd Stigsnaes refinery early next year.</p>
<p>In September KPC signed a deal with Agip SpA for a 50 percent share in its the Italian firm's Millazzo refinery. The refinery has a current output of about 240,000 bpd.</p>
<p>KPC is also in serious talks with the Indian Oil Corp (IOC) and Thailand's Thai Petrochemical Industry Plc on possible plans to build joint venture refineries, said Furaih.</p>
<p>IOC plans to build a new refinery in the north eastern Indian state of Orissa. TPI wants to build a 300,000 bpd refinery by 1999.</p>
<p>KPC has a local refining capacity of 830,000 bpd.</p>
