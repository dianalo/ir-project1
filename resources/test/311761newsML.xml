<p>Following are economists' reactions to New Zealand December quarter inflation data released on Friday.</p>
<p>The Consumer Price Index rose 0.7 percent for an annual rise of 2.6 percent, versus economists' expectations of 0.36 percent and 2.15 percent respectively.</p>
<p>DAVID PLANK, CHIEF ECONOMIST, BANKERS TRUST</p>
<p>"Clearly higher than the market and ourselves had expected. Generalised inflation pressures more widespread than expected. It is only 0.1 percent more than the Reserve Bank had expected so I don't think they will be looking for much of a reaction by the market, but it is showing inflation is very sticky around that 0.5 to 0.6 percent level.</p>
<p>" In fact we have averaged 0.6 in the last year per quarter, so that is 2.5 percent in annual terms, which is too close to the top of the 0-3 percent band for the Reserve Bank to be comfortable with."  </p>
<p>PAUL STEWART, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANZ BANK</p>
<p>"Certainly above market expectations, but within the margin of forecasting error, I think, for the Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>"So from the Reserve Bank's perspective, it doesn't significantly change their stance.</p>
<p>"In December they signalled that they were prepared to tolerate the easing in condictions that had occurred but were wary of any further easing, and I think that will still be their position.  </p>
<p>"So that means the direction of bank bills in the near term is now contingent on the currency, and we see the currency strengthening immediately post the statement, and as a result bank bills in fact drifted off slightly."</p>
<p>MATTHEW GOODSON, ECONOMIST, GARLICK AND CO</p>
<p>"There seem to be broad-based price pressures coming through. Housing isn't such a factor this time. There are a whole range of various bits and pieces coming through. Obviously the air travel and the health insurance have been two big factors here. But it certainly...does put any thought of easing into the background for some time now."  </p>
<p>He said 90-day bank bills, which fell on the announcement, were likely to tick up over the next day or two.</p>
<p>"The initial reaction is that they haven't but I think we will see them up at least another 10 points or so."</p>
<p>He agreed that the currency, which rose from US$0.7079/76 before the 10.45 a.m. (2145 GMT) announcement to 0.7094/01 shortly afterwards, was taking the heat of the poorer inflation outlook.  </p>
<p>STEPHEN TOPLIS, DOYLE PATERSON BROWN ECONOMIST</p>
<p>"It's fair to say there's a heavy influence of government policy-related price increases in this particular quarter."</p>
<p>He cited rises in Housing New Zealand and local authority rentals, central and local government rates, tobacco excise duty and medical insurance, the latter being partly attributable to changes in the health system.</p>
<p>People would now expect slightly tighter monetary conditions than before the announcement, Toplis said.  </p>
<p>Of the market's reaction, he said: "It (the data) reduced the likelihood that interest rates would fall markedly and therefore reduced the risk of holding the New Zealand dollar, so it fed through in the currency rather than the bill rate."</p>
<p>However, Toplis said he would not be surprised if much of the currency movement unwound itself over the course of the day.</p>
