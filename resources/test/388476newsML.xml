<p>The NATO allies agreed sweeping changes on Wednesday to a landmark arms control treaty limiting conventional forces in Europe in the latest attempt to soothe Russian concern over the alliance's plans to enlarge eastwards.</p>
<p>The new position, which will be presented by the western powers in Vienna on Thursday to talks updating the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, takes account of several Russian objections to existing ceilings on arsenals.</p>
<p>NATO sources said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would simultaneously unveil the proposal to Russian leaders in Moscow as part of a package of measures designed to win Russian acquiescence to alliance enlargement.</p>
<p>The West's plan to take former Warsaw Pact countries, led by Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, into the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), created to defend the West from attack by the Soviet Union, has infuriated Moscow.</p>
<p>NATO countries have already stated they do not plan to station nuclear missiles or troops on the territories of any new members, but the assurance has failed to make any impact on Russian objections, shared by the entire political class.</p>
<p>The allies hope the proposals to alter the CFE treaty, which caps both troops and equipment, will convince the Russians that NATO will not take advantage of enlargement to alter the strategic balance in its favour.</p>
<p>The new NATO position clearly accepts the principle of limits on the arsenals of individual countries as opposed to regions. "This makes sure that Russia does not face off against NATO as a bloc," said one alliance source.</p>
<p>The alliance has also accepted a Russian demand to have "territorial" as opposed to "national" limits, effectively preventing NATO from massing troops in one particular area near Russia's borders.</p>
<p>The U.S. has also committed itself to unilateral cuts in the number of tanks, artillery pieces, helicopters and armoured personnel carriers currently stationed in Europe.</p>
<p>"This offer would take them below the existing ceilings which is another clear concession to Russia," added the source.</p>
<p>Albright's package of sweeteners to help Moscow accept enlargement also includes a proposal to create a joint NATO-Russia peacekeeping force and an offer of close consultation at all levels of the alliance's command structure.</p>
<p>In Brussels  on Tuesday, Albright used her maiden visit to NATO's headquarters to stress enlargement would go ahead whether or not a deal was struck with Russia on a new charter or permanent council allowing permanent consultations.</p>
<p>NATO is due to invite new countries to join the alliance at a special summit in Madrid in July. Albright said she wanted entry negotiations to be completed by December to allow two years for ratification by national parliaments.</p>
<p>Moscow showed no sign on Tuesday of easing its bitter opposition to enlargement and pushed instead for more concessions.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, the latest in a stream of top Western politicians to visit Moscow, was treated to the now-familiar litany of Russian complaints to the plan.</p>
