<headline>Mobilcom shares soar on H1 earnings news.</headline>
<text>
<p>FRANKFURT, July 30 - Shares of German mobile phone startup Mobilcom AG soared on Wednesday, climbing 17 percent after the company said pretax profit more than doubled in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>Shares traded at 155 marks at 1215 GMT, up from yesterday's close at 132 marks.</p>
<p>Earlier Mobilcom reported 10.84 million marks in first-half pretax profit, compared to 5.2 million marks the year-ago period. After-tax profit in the first six months of the year totaled 5.42 million marks -- beating the 5.4 million marks reported for all of 1996.</p>
<p>Mobilcom, which is traded on Frankfurt's New Market for midcap growth stocks, attributed the rise to a wave of new customers. At the end of June it had 190,000 customers, 29,000 more than at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>The company's shares were issued at 62.50 marks on March 10, when the Frankfurt bourse lauched the New Market, an exchange modelled after New York's NASDAQ exchange.</p>
