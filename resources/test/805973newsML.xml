<headline>IBP says no USDA contacts on E.coli probe.</headline>

<p>IBP Inc, one of the nation's largest beef packers, said it has not been contacted by U.S. Agriculture Department investigators regarding last week's recall by Hudson Foods Inc of 1.2 million lbs of ground beef.</p>
<p>Arkansas-based Hudson Foods announced the record recall of beef because of possible contamination by a strain of E.coli, a potentially deadly bacteria. The meat was produced over three days in June at Hudson Foods' Columbus, Neb. plant. The government is probing the source of contamination.</p>
<p>Traders on the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Monday reported rumors that USDA investigators had contacted IBP, a meat supplier to Hudson Foods.</p>
<p>But IBP spokesman Don Willoughby denied those rumors. "To the best of our peoples' knowledge, no USDA SWAT teams have descended on IBP's corporate (office) or IBP plants," he said.</p>
<p>USDA Secretary Dan Glickman last week ordered department investigators, which he called "SWAT teams", to investigate the possible contamination.</p>
<p>Willoughby said IBP in the past has supplied beef to Hudson Foods. "We have had no communication with Hudson Foods concerning any product we have supplied them, " he said.</p>
<p>Susan Conley, spokeswoman for the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service, told Reuters on Monday that USDA would be looking at plants that supplied beef to Hudson Foods and was still "pinning down" the exact suppliers.</p>
<p>Charles Jurgensmeyer, Hudson Foods' chief financial officer, said Monday the company does not have slaughter operations but buys beef from a small group of suppliers, which he declined to name.</p>
