<p>The Canadian dollar is stuck in a narrow range against the U.S. dollar, but it is soaring to rarefied heights, along with its southern counterpart, against other major currencies.</p>
<p>Canada's dollar this year reached a three-year high against the German mark and a four-year high against the Japanese yen.</p>
<p>Some analysts are expecting it also to hit a four-year high against the U.S. dollar this year of 80 cents.</p>
<p>Driving the Canadian dollar's strength are improved economic fundamentals trumpeted even by Canada's central bank.</p>
<p>"All in all, the pace of economic expansion should accelerate in the coming quarters, reducing the slack in the economy," the Bank of Canada said in its Winter Review.</p>
<p>Some market analysts said they expected Canada's gross domestic product to grow by up to 4 percent in 1997, with inflation staying in the lower half of the central bank's 1 percent to 3 percent target range.</p>
<p>"In the near term the U.S. dollar still has some further upside to go. So the Canadian dollar will rise alongside of that," said Craig Wright, assistant chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada.</p>
<p>"Then maybe later in the year as the global economies turn higher and maybe take some of the steam out of the U.S. dollar, that should be offset by a stronger Canada," Wright added.</p>
<p>The Canadian dollar, which has been unable to break higher than 76 U.S. cents in the past two years, rose to 1.2373 marks on Friday from 1.1215 marks at the end of 1996 and to 92.21 yen from 84.53 yen in the same period.</p>
<p>Economists said the Canadian currency had stood firm against the U.S. dollar's onslaught because of Canada's improving fiscal fundamentals and falling government deficits.</p>
<p>"The U.S. dollar is not rising against us because we have a fundamentally strong currency too," said Michael Gregory, senior economist at Lehman Brothers in Toronto. "It's just that those strengths are only neutralising the underlying effects of the U.S. dollar right now."</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar has risen sharply to about 1.6686 marks in trading on Friday from 1.5410 at the end of 1996 and to 124.40 yen from 115.90 yen in the same period.</p>
