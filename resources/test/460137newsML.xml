<p>Britain said on Friday it had failed to reach agreement on crucial areas during talks with China to hammer out details of Hong Kong's handover on June 30.</p>
<p>Hugh Davies, a senior British representative taking part in the talks, said he was disappointed and frustrated that after five years of talks with China, all details had not yet been worked out.  </p>
<p>Davies was speaking after the Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison Group (JLG), the diplomatic body handling Hong Kong's return to China, had held three days of talks in London.</p>
<p>"Although we have reached some agreements this week, there are still a number of important matters where consensus is still elusive," Davies told a news conference organised by the British Foreign Office.</p>
<p>"Perhaps most disappointingly, we have failed to resolve our differences on right of abode."</p>
<p>"This is frustrating, because after almost five years of discussions, we are now in a large measure of agreement on almost all the substantive issues involved in this complex subject. But we need to close the remaining gaps."</p>
