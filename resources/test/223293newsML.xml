<headline>UK Adviser - Budget benefit fraud scheme flawed.</headline>

<p>Gavyn Davies, a member of the UK Treasury's panel of independent advisers, said on Thursday that budget plans to cut spending by a crackdown on welfare fraud did not stand up to scrutiny.</p>
<p>"You really have to put a big question mark over the spend-to-save package," Davies, who is also Goldman Sachs' chief economist, told the Treasury select committee. "It wouldn't be too cynical too suggest that...the Treasury has been unable to get public spending in its genuine sense down to within the target limits it set itself and has therefore invented these fraud packages in order to get public spending down."  </p>
<p>In his budget speech, Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke pledged to crack down on benefit fraud and get Inland Revenue experts to probe how "big, sophisticated companies pay so little tax." He also said he would put an end to "some of the clever wheezes" dreamed up to avoid paying Value-Added-Tax. This so-called "spend to save package" would cost 800 million stg over three years but recoup 6.7 billion stg, Clarke forecast.</p>
<p>Davies said that two and three years out, the budget saw the anti-fraud packages removing in the region of five billion pounds from the PSBR.  </p>
<p>"I certainly would question whether this money is actually going to be possible to raise in the way the Treasury said," Davies said. "This committee...needs to really press the Treasury on exactly how and why they believe this anti-fraud campaign is going to come up with such huge dividends."</p>
<p>Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the Treasury Committee it was difficult to assess how much these measures would save.</p>
<p>Davies also noted the government's planned spending cuts included substantial asset sales.  </p>
<p>"There are substantial additional asset sales which have been used to reduce public spending which will have very little restrictive effect on the economy," Davies said.</p>
<p>He noted the sale of Ministry of Defence married quarters and the sale of the student loan book had been used to get public spending targets down. "There are a lot more asset sales in here than the Treasury has said," Davies said.</p>
<p>Clarke said Britain's public sector borrowing requirement would fall to 19 billion stg next year, cutting his forecast by four billion pounds and leaving the PSBR target 7.0 billion below this year's target.  </p>
<p>"My best guess is that the (budget) package will be modestly restrictive, not as restrictive as it appears from the Red Book," Davies said. -- Mike Peacock, London Newsroom +44 171 542 5109</p>
