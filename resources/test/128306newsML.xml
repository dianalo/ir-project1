<p>Troubled Italian information technology group Olivetti was reported on Friday to be in talks to sell its PC division to Taiwanese group Acer and to be on the brink of opening its board to institutional investors.</p>
<p>Financial daily Milano Finanza quoted Acer's Italian operations head Aldo Grech as saying: "Acer has had and is continuing to have contacts with Olivetti".</p>
<p>Noone was immediately available at Olivetti to comment on that report, or another in Il Sole 24 Ore which said that the group was planning a board meeting on Friday at which it would give representation to one or two of the institutions which control about 70 percent of its share capital.  </p>
<p>Olivetti shares were down 2.39 percent at 466 lire and topped the actives list in Milan on volume of more than 10 million shares.</p>
<p>Olivetti workers were due to stage an eight-hour strike on Friday to press for a what union leaders have called a "credible restructuring plan" and to seek undertakings from the government to support the Italian information technology sector.</p>
<p>In rain-swept Rome, as part of the day of protest, Olivetti workers were staging a national demonstration.</p>
