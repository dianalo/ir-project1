<p>China on Friday reported sizzling growth in the first quarter, but its economy remains plagued by lumbering state enterprises with losses soaring as they struggle to adapt to a market economy.</p>
<p>Gross domestic product (GDP) rose a year-on-year 9.4 percent in the first quarter to 1,468.6 billion yuan ($176 billion), State Statistical Bureau spokesman Ye Zhen said.</p>
<p>The agricultural sector grew by five percent, industry by 10.6 percent and the service sector by 8.3 percent.</p>
<p>The first quarter GDP growth rate slipped by 0.8 percentage points compared with the year-ago period, but Qiu Xiaohua, the bureau's chief economist, said he still considered a rate of 9.4 percent as fast.</p>
<p>"It's not low. It's higher than the national target," Qiu told a news conference.</p>
<p>China has set an official target of eight percent for economic growth this year, trying to cool an economy that still shows signs of possible overheating. China's GDP soared by 9.7 percent last year, among the fastest in the world.</p>
<p>Strong economic growth had been maintained while keeping inflation at relatively modest levels, officials said.</p>
<p>China's benchmark retail price inflation rose a year-on-year 2.6 percent in the first quarter while consumer price inflation was 5.2 percent, Ye said.</p>
<p>Beijing has set a target of 6.0 percent inflation in 1997, from 6.1 percent in 1996 and 14.8 percent the year before -- and economists expect the 1997 rise to be as low as 3.0-4.0 percent.</p>
<p>However, clouds from decades of central planning still hung over China's economy.</p>
<p>State enterprises posted combined losses of 19.3 billion yuan in the first two months, climbing 11.8 percent from the year-ago period, Ye said. He declined to say what percentage of state firms had sunk into the red.</p>
<p>Combined pre-tax profits of state enterprise rose 11 percent year-on-year in the first two months, Ye said.</p>
<p>About 70 percent of China's more than 100,000 state firms lose money and have struggled to adapt since the country ended Soviet-style central planning and embraced market reform.</p>
<p>China has halted or slashed subsidies to lumbering state firms to make them become competetive, but with social costs.</p>
<p>"The iron rice bowl has been smashed," Ye said. State firms provided cradle-to-grave welfare before late paramount leader Deng Xiaoping launched economic reform 19 years ago.</p>
<p>By the end of 1996, 7.5 million state enterprise employees were without work, many still nominally employed but receiving no salary, Ye said. Of the total, one-seventh were in China's struggling northeastern rust belt.</p>
<p>Urban unemployment at end-March was virtually unchanged at 3.0 percent, Ye said.</p>
<p>Qiu defended state firms despite their drag on the economy, saying China's economic boom would have been impossible without the huge sector, which Beijing calls the pillar of the economy.</p>
<p>He warned that if the non-state sector continued to grow at double the speed of the state, then output of state enterprises would halve to just one-third of total national output.</p>
<p>But state assets would still account for two-thirds of the national total, he said. He gave no time frame.</p>
<p>Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin has made the reform of state enterprises a policy priority for this year, describing it as a "major political problem".</p>
