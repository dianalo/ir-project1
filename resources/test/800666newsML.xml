<p>The United Nations  struggled on Thursday to revive momentum in deadlocked talks on the future of divided Cyprus, with no sign of a breakthrough a day before they were to end.</p>
<p>Officials close to the talks said the U.N. special envoy for Cyprus, Diego Cordovez, chairing the talks, met Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash to discuss the text of a possible U.N. statement on the continuation of talks.</p>
<p>"Now, the bargaining is over the text of a U.N. statement," said one diplomat close to the talks, held under media blackout near the Swiss lakeside resort of Montreux following July's inconclusive round in New York.</p>
<p>Prior to the Montreux session, Turkish Cypriots had ruled out signing a joint document and on Wednesday Denktash refused to sign or discuss a new, amended U.N. proposal. He said Cordovez tabled it despite his objection.</p>
<p>Disagreement over sovereignty, territory, refugees, security and guarantor states have for decades blocked efforts to reunite Cyprus in a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation.</p>
<p>The island has been divided since 1974 when Turkey occupied its north in response to a coup in the capital Nicosia engineered by the military junta then ruling Greece.</p>
<p>Denktash has repeatedly said he will pull out of the talks unless the European Union reverses its plan to start entry negotiations for Cyprus -- effectively the Greek part of the partitioned east Mediterranean island -- early next year.</p>
<p>Official sources close to the Greek Cypriots said Clerides had a "positive predisposition" towards signing the new U.N. proposal but sought assurances that a paragraph urging the sides to refrain from action that may damage the process did not refer to the contentious issue of EU membership.</p>
<p>The Greek Cypriots sought to bring another one of their cards on the table -- the volatile issue of missiles.</p>
<p>They signalled they may be prepared for a tradeoff on anti-aircraft missiles they have ordered from Russia if Denktash agreed to demilitarisation of Cyprus, where 36,000 Turkish troops are stationed in the north.</p>
<p>The United Nations is now resorting to a fallback position, with Cordovez trying to produce a U.N. statement that would include positions and forms of words acceptable to both sides.</p>
<p>The amended U.N. document was the third tabled since the start of the first round of talks in New York by Cordovez, who is trying to draw out a compromise by drafting working papers with different options while trying to keep the talks going.</p>
<p>The Turkish Cypriot side may have been buoyed by Turkish soccer team Galatasaray`s crushing 4-1 victory over Swiss champions Sion in a nearby town on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>All their officials attended the match apart from Denktash who went to a dinner with Clerides and Cordovez hosted by the Swiss government.</p>
<p>But the negotiating table, described by one diplomat as a "dialogue of the deaf", all sides appear to be going over the same divisive territory, officials from both sides said.</p>
<p>"It is high time to have a solution to this problem. This is the oldest problem pending before the United Nations," said Greek Cypriot government spokesman Manolis Christofides.</p>
<p>"If you take the volumes of newspapers in Cyprus for the last 40 years, the front page is always the same."</p>
<p>Efforts to reunite Cyprus were given fresh impetus by the EU decision on Cyprus and by the desire of new U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan to notch up some early successes.</p>
<p>But Cordovez has the tough job of trying to coax Clerides, 78, and Denktash, 73, into open ground from positions which both have held unchanged for more than 20 years.</p>
<p>Both men, who have known and battled each other for nearly half a century since they were young, London-trained lawyers, have an eye on how any deal or lack of it would be viewed by their domestic constituencies.</p>
<p>Both are under pressure with Clerides facing a presidential election in February 1998 and Denktash facing opposition at home to his stance on the EU by Cypriot Turks who want to improve their living standards and stop relying on handouts from Turkey.</p>
