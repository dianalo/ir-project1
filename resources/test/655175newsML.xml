<p>Following are views on the direction of Philippine stocks on Wednesday and main factors likely to affect trading:</p>
<p>* Philippine shares may still trade in a narrow band with an upward bias buoyed by lower yields for the government's two-year note and the decision of the Supreme Court to uphold its ban on a petition to change the Constitution, traders said.</p>
<p>* "Investment funds are looking for alternatives with the T-bill rates going down. Then you have the decision of the Court. We have both fundamentals and political continuity," said Ramon Adviento, analyst at Sun Hung Kai Securities.  </p>
<p>* "Local investors will view the Court's decision as positive while foreign investors will likely be neutral as they are more concerned about who the president would be endorsing," said Helen Alvarez, research director at All Asia Securities.</p>
<p>* On Tuesday, the Philippine Stock Exchange composite index ended 3.26 points lower at 2,775.11.</p>
<p>* The Dow Jones on Tuesday ended 60.77 points higher at 7,539.27 closing above the 7,500 level for the first time. PLDT's ADR rose $0 3/8 to $59 1/2 at close.</p>
<p>* The Philippine peso closed higher at 26.373 to the dollar vs 26.379.</p>
<p>* The Philippine interbank call loan average was unchanged at 14.03125 percent.</p>
<p>* The yield on the Philippine two-year treasury note fell to 11.625 percent on Tuesday from the previous month's 12.0 percent, the Bureau of Treasury said.</p>
<p>* The Supreme Court on Tuesday doused chances of a second term for President Fidel Ramos by upholding its ban on a petition to change the constitution so he could seek re-election.</p>
<p>* San Miguel Corp has agreed to hold a 25 percent stake in Australian bottler Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd for three years, except in some limited circumstances, according to details of the share swap agreement.</p>
<p>* Sinophil Corp said the Securities and Exchange Commission had approved its conversion into a holding firm from an oil exploration company.  It also obtained SEC approval for an increase in its authorised capital stock to 20 billion pesos from two billion.</p>
<p>* Philippine car sales fell 5.8 percent in the first five months of the year to 33,912 units from 35,995 a year earlier, the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers Inc of the Philippines.</p>
<p>* Davao Union Cement Corp said it made an unaudited 435 million peso net income for the first 10 months of its fiscal year ending April 1997.</p>
<p>* A unit of Mondragon International Philippines Inc and the state-run Clark Development Corp said they have sought mediation to settle a dispute over rentals for a Mondragon resort.</p>
<p>* Newspaper Malaya said quoting Philippine Stock Exchange president Jose Yulo that the ban on brokers trading on their own accounts will be interim until detailed rules governing the transactions are issued.</p>
<p>* Philippine Daily Inquirer said some bank-creditors of cash-strapped Victorias Milling Corp are pushing for separate loan restructuring arrangements for the parent firm and its subsidiaries.</p>
<p>* Manila Times reported that creditors of Victorias Milling continue to insist the sugar refiner must honor the 500 million peso worth of loan collateral, in the form of Refined Sugar Delivery Orders issued by its marketing subsidiary.</p>
<p>* BusinessWorld said a lower court has ruled a temporary freeze on the implementation of a government programme allowing the entry of more agricultural products at low tariff rates.</p>
