<headline>Toronto stocks end mixed after three-day rally.</headline>
<dateline>TORONTO</dateline>
<text>
<p>Toronto stocks finished mixed on Friday, as investors took profits after a record three-day rally on Canada's biggest stock market.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Composite Index slipped 4.88 points to 6780.27, but not before setting an intraday high of 6803.71.</p>
<p>Trading was moderate compared to recent sessions. Almost 86 million shares changed hands, worth C$1.46 billion ($1.05 billion).</p>
<p>"People are anxiously looking to the weekend. They need a little money to spend so they took some money out of the market," said Fred Ketchen, senior vice-president and director of equity trading for ScotiaMcLeod Inc.</p>
<p>The hardest hit sectors were conglomerates, pipelines, retailing and banking. Communications and precious metals led gains in six of 14 sub-groups.</p>
<p>The flood of corporate earnings that energized equities this week was expected to slow next week, Ketchen said.</p>
<p>"The flood is starting to turn into a trickle. The question is what do people start looking to next?" he said.</p>
<p>Advancing stocks outpaced declines 484 to 466, with 344 issues unchanged.</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* Canadian Pacific Ltd. fell 1.05 to close at 42.25.</p>
<p>CP shares pushed the conglomerates group to new heights earlier this week after reporting fatter profits.</p>
<p>* Among other stocks hit by profit takers, Northern Telecom Ltd. dropped 2.25 to 142.75. Canadian National Railway Co. slipped 0.55 to 69.25.</p>
<p>* Linamar Corp. jumped 3.15 to 73.15 after it posted sharply higher second-quarter profits late on Thursday. West Fraser Timber added 2.50 to 45 on stronger earnings.</p>
<p>* Rio Alto Exploration Ltd. gained 0.10 to 11.90 after the company said it would issue 6.5 million common shares at C$11.75 ($8.50) each on a bought deal basis.</p>
