<p>Philippine President Fidel Ramos pledged on Wednesday to boost economic ties with Panama and said his country could serve as a bridge to Asian economies.</p>
<p>"I am certain that the Philippines can serve as your bridge to the ASEAN Free Trade Area. You have access not only to our country's 70 million domestic market, but also to ASEAN and its 420 million people," Ramos told Panamanian business leaders at the end of a two-day official visit to the Central American nation.</p>
<p>The seven-member Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) will launch a free trade area by 2003. ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Cambodia, Laos and Burma have observer status.</p>
<p>"This is a time of opportunity for developing countries like Panama and the Philippines," Ramos said. "We are here to explore business opportunities with you. And we want to invite you ... to look to the Philippines as your gateway to Asia and the Pacific."</p>
<p>Ramos met privately with President Ernesto Perez Balladares on Tuesday and was expected to sign various accords with him at an official ceremony at the presidential palace later on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ramos and his delegation of some 200 people, including some 60 businessmen, also discussed investment opportunities in U.S. military installations that are scheduled to be turned over to Panamanian control in 1999.</p>
