<p>Sri Lanka stocks closed barely changed as investors searched for direction after the index reached a resistance level, but turnover was high on local buying, brokers said.</p>
<p>The all share index closed 0.06 points higher at 600.05. National Development Bank rose 5.25 rupees to 200.25, Hotels Corporation 14.50 to 60.</p>
<p>"The index will mark time at a maximum of five percent above or below 600 points, until there is some news to move it," said Ruan Dayananda of Asia Securities.  </p>
<p>He said the next direction may come from results for the quarter to September 30 or the budget on November 6.</p>
<p>Turnover was a healthy 74.25 million rupees on 1.7 million shares. The main volumes for the day were local buying of 1.2 million Sampath Bank and foreign buying of 32,000 National Development Bank.</p>
<p>Institutional investors, while waiting for direction, are prepared to hunt for bargains, brokers said.</p>
<p>"We are using the current low prices to take long-term positions," said Derendra Abayaratna of Ceybank Unit Trust.</p>
