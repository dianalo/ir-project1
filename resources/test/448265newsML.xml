<headline>Most British firms unconcerned by minimum wage - survey.</headline>

<p>Almost four fifths of British businesses believe a national minimum wage would have no damaging impact if it were set at 3.75 pounds ($5.97) an hour, a survey said on Monday.</p>
<p>Reed Personnel Services, a recruitment specialist, said 79 percent of the 969 firms surveyed said business would not suffer from minimum wage legislation set at that level.</p>
<p>The opposition Labour party has committed itself to introducting a minimum wage if it wins power in the election, due to be held by May.</p>
<p>It has not yet suggested a level, but plans to take advice from a low new pay commission which will include employers' and employees' representatives.</p>
<p>However, even if the minimum wage were set at a higher level, a majority of firms said they would still be unaffected.</p>
<p>If the rate were set at 3.50 pounds, 76 percent of firms said it would not be a problem, although the remaining 19 percent said their business would suffer.</p>
<p>Even at 4.0 pounds per hour, 63 percent of firms said there business would not be damaged.</p>
<p>"The great majority of UK businesses predict they would be unaffected by a National Minimum Wage," said Alec Reed, chairman of Reed Personnel Services.</p>
<p>"However, the report shows it would be important for any future implementation to be handled carefully, and not railroaded though."</p>
<p>He said in particular, the worries of those businesses who feel they have most to lose should be carefully addressed.</p>
<p>The Labour Party welcomed the findings.</p>
<p>"This survey has nailed the Tory lie that a minimum wage is bad for business," said Labour's chief employment spokesman Ian McCartney. ($ = 0.627 British Pounds)</p>
