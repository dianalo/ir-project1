<p>An active day in the Eurobond market saw a couple of benchmark transactions, one from Eastern Europe and the other from Latin America.</p>
<p>The City of St Petersburg launched its first Eurobond which was oversubscribed following extensive investor presentations across Asia, Europe and the U.S</p>
<p>The $300 million five-year bond was priced to yield 312.5 basis points over U.S. Treasury notes and pays a coupon of 9.50 percent.</p>
<p>"The purpose of this issue is to refinance with longer maturity and lower cost a portion of the City's domestic Rouble short-term debt," lead manager for the transaction Salomon Brothers said in a statement.</p>
<p>Argentina launched its second sterling-denominated Eurobond which saw strong British institutional demand and was oversubscribed, syndicate officials said.</p>
<p>The 200 million stg 10-year Eurobond was priced to yield 280 basis points over gilts and traded three notches tighter at 277 b.p. when the bond was freed to trade, dealers said.</p>
<p>There were also sales to retail investors in Continental Europe -- Germany, Italy and Switzerland -- who were attracted by the 10.0 percent coupon.</p>
<p>Argentina's debut sterling-denominated five-year Eurobond was priced to yield 390 b.p. over gilts last July and has since tightened to trade around 210 b.p, dealers said.</p>
