<p>Hungarian overnight rates gave a quarter of a point by the end of session compared to their opening rates amid ample liquidity on the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>The overnight rates finished at 20.50 percent, compared to 20.75 percent at opening and 20.625/20.875 percent at Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>Dealers said trading volumes were small and overall activity was modest.</p>
<p>They added they did not expect substantial changes on Friday as no tax payments were due this week.</p>
