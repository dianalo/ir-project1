<p>Some 1,000 Jordanian students burnt Israeli flags and demonstrated inside their university campus on Saturday in support of a "new Palestinian intifada (uprising)" against Israel.</p>
<p>The protesters, including bearded young men and veiled women, raised banners cursing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
<p>"Oh Bibi (nickname for Netanyahu), you terrorist, the blood of our martyrs is dear to us," one banner said.</p>
<p>"Netanyahu's aggressive policies are only a confirmation of the Zionist enemy's barbarism...They torpedo any talk about peaceful coexistence," said another.</p>
<p>It was the largest sign of popular anger in Jordan since violence flared in the West Bank and Gaza Strip on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some demonstrators wiped their shoes with two white-and-blue striped Israeli flags before setting them ablaze at the main square inside the campus of the state-run Jordan University in Amman.</p>
<p>Other students taped a large Israeli flag over the entrance leading to the science faculty so that students entering or leaving the building would walk on it.</p>
<p>The march was organised by a student council comprising Moslem fundamentalists, leftist parties as well as independents, most of whom oppose Jordan's 1994 peace treaty with Israel.</p>
<p>Nearly 70 Palestinians and Israelis were killed in three days of gunbattles and stone-throwing demonstrations across the West Bank and Gaza this week triggered by Israel's opening of an archaeological tunnel near Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque, Islam's third holiest shrine.</p>
<p>The worst wave of violence since the 1993 Israel-PLO Oslo accords has angered most Jordanians, many of whom have family living in the West Bank, which the kingdom ruled from 1952 until losing it to Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.</p>
<p>Several cultural societies that had planned parties for the weekend to raise private funds published advertisements in local newspapers postponing the events "because of the tragic developments that our Palestinian brethren are passing through."</p>
<p>King Hussein, whose country remains the historic guardian of Moslem holy sites in Arab Jerusalem since 1950, has called for an immediate end to bloodshed and the formation of an international committee to probe the matter.</p>
