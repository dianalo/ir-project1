<p>California's attorney general is expected Thursday to sue major tobacco companies to recoup public health-care costs related to smoking, state sources said.</p>
<p>California, the most populous state, with billions of dollars in potential claims, has watched from the sidelines for three years as other states have taken legal action.</p>
<p>But pressure has been building on state Attorney General Dan Lungren in recent months to join the fight.</p>
<p>State sources said Lungren plans to file the state's tobacco lawsuit this week, most likely on Thursday.</p>
<p>His spokesman, Rob Stutzman, would only say that Lungren would "make an announcement regarding tobacco tomorrow."</p>
<p>Oregon and Idaho sued tobacco companies Tuesday, bringing to 36 the number of states seeking restitution for health care costs related to illness allegedly caused by smoking.</p>
<p>Lungren, a Republican, has long asserted that a lawsuit by California against tobacco companies would fail because of a 1987 state law shielding them from product liability claims.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, state Assembly Speaker Cruz Bustamante, a Democrat, introduced legislation to remove that barrier and clear the way for Lungren to sue the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>The state Senate and Assembly both approved the bill last week, sending it to Republican Gov. Pete Wilson for review.</p>
<p>Wilson plans to sign the bill at a news conference in Los Angeles Thursday and to call on Lungren to file the state's suit immediately, said Wilson's spokeswoman, Lisa Kalustian.</p>
<p>"This is certainly important for the state of California," Kalustian said of the tobacco bill. "The governor's going to sign this bill tomorrow."</p>
<p>Once signed into law by Wilson, Bustamante's legislation would take effect immediately.</p>
<p>Lungren has already reached a settlement with tobacco company Brooke Group Ltd. to recoup health care costs.</p>
<p>Under terms of that settlement, Brooke, parent of Liggett Tobacco Co., has agreed to reimburse California for public health costs incurred as a result of smoking as well as providing internal documents that could help the state sue others in the tobacco industry.</p>
<p>In their own legal assault, 13 California counties, two cities, and the city and county of San Francisco have already sued major tobacco companies in state court. A similar lawsuit by the local governments was filed in federal court to recover their health-care costs.</p>
