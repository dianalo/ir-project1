<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's visit to Prague next week will be key to winning broad Czech support for a post-World War Two reconciliation accord between the two countries, a senior Czech diplomat said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Czech officials want the accord to receive wide backing from Czech MPs and that could be determined by Kohl's words and actions during his two-day visit, said the diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity.</p>
<p>"There are no worries that it will not pass, but we want it to have large support and honest acceptance...it depends a lot on what Chancellor Kohl says in Prague," he said.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic and Germany concluded nearly two years of delicate negotiations in December on the text of a joint declaration aimed at ending ill-feeling and suspicion lingering after World War Two and its aftermath.</p>
<p>Kohl and Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus are due to sign the accord next Tuesday but it must subsequently be approved by both parliaments.</p>
<p>"If Kohl talks only about Germany, it would be too bad for the debate," the official said.</p>
<p>In the text, Bonn expresses sorrow over the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands. Prague expresses its regret for Czech brutality in the post-war expulsion of ethnic Germans.</p>
<p>The declaration was approved by both governments, which have said it should not be changed by their parliaments.</p>
<p>The Bonn parliament will debate the declaration next week and the Czech parliament will consider it in early February.</p>
<p>The Czech centre-right ruling coalition, which is two seats short of a majority in the parliament, fully supports the pact while the main opposition partner says it still has some concerns about the text.</p>
<p>Two other minor opposition parties see the pact as unacceptable.</p>
