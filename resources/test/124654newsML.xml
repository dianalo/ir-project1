<p>U.S. car giant Ford, which on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate 4,000 jobs through early retirement, on Thursday indicated that around a quarter of the cuts would be in continental Europe.</p>
<p>Ford's global news manager Don Hume, based in Britain, told Reuters that the 1,000 mainland Europe job cuts were likely to be focused in Germany and Spain.</p>
<p>He added that the British operation had already announced that 1,000 jobs would go a few weeks ago and that was also part of the total.</p>
<p>Ford chairman Alex Trotman has been visiting the Valencia plant and will visit Germany next, bypassing Britain.</p>
