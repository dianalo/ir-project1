<p>The German Ifo economics institute gave the following data from its February business climate survey:</p>
<p>W. Germany- monthly change     March 1997	     Feb 1997</p>
<p>     Business climate		  -10.2		-7.8</p>
<p>     Business conditions	     -20.8		-17.3</p>
<p>     Business expectations	   +1.2		 +2.8</p>
<p>East Germany-monthly change    March 1997	     Feb 1997</p>
<p>     Business climate		  -12.7		-12.7</p>
<p>     Business conditions	     -20.5		-21.1</p>
<p>     Business expectations	   -3.9		 -3.5</p>
<p>NOTE - IFO last month started releasing data on a balanced basis, which the institute believes better reflects business confidence after unification. The figures reflect a change from month-ago numbers rather than giving an index value compared with the base year of 1991. East and west index figures had drifted apart after the eastern post-unification upswing and the western states' recession. Figures could range between extremes of plus and minus 100 points. A positive figure represents an improvement from the previous month, a negative figure represents a deterioration. The final figure is calculated by balancing out positive and negative comments from firms, ignoring the neutral assessments.</p>
