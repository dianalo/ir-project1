<headline>MAM at record high, helped by bid talk.</headline>

<p>Shares in Mercury Asset Management Plc hit a new record peak on Friday, boosted by expectations of further equity market strength and talk that foreign banks are looking to buy UK fund management businesses, dealers said.</p>
<p>By 1125 GMT, MAM shares were 8-1/2p higher at 13.16 stg after setting a high of 13.19.</p>
<p>Dealers said expectations of a near-term UK interest rate hike had faded, lifting forecasts for UK equity market performance in coming months. Rising share values lift the value of investment holdings of fund management groups as well as drawing fresh investment cash into equity investments.</p>
<p>Talk that Dresdner Bank and ABN AMRO Holding were looking to take over a UK fund manager was also attracting speculative buyers, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The bid talk is attracting a bit of speculation but it's really the strength of the market that's been pulling up the stock," one market-maker said.</p>
