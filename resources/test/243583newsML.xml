<p>Grain and oilseed exports reported by USDA and private export sources.</p>
<p>WHEAT SALE - Egypt on Sunday bought at least 300,000 tonnes of Australian wheat at prices below $145 per tonne, fob, European grain traders said. The wheat was for shipment in February. On Sunday it also bought 200,000 tonnes of Argentine wheat at prices ranging from $130-132 a tonne FOB.  </p>
<p>WHEAT SALE - Two Philippine firms on Monday bought 35,000 tonnes of Canadian wheat for immediate shipment, traders said. Prices at which the firms bought the Canadian wheat were not immediately available, but traders said "they were definitely below the prevailing price of $195 per tonne FOB for U.S. wheat." High prices of U.S. wheat had compelled local flour millers to look for alternative sources.</p>

The Pakistani Ministry of Food and Agriculture invited bids to be opened at 1100 Pakistan Standard Time on December 22 and must remain valid until 1800 PST on December 23 for the supply of 270,000 tonnes U.S. soft white wheat in bulk plus/minus five percent buyer's option to be financed under the GSM 102 export program. In a separate tender, it invited bids to be opened at the same date and time for the supply of 270,000 tonnes of Australian white milling wheat.  </p>
<p>WHEAT TENDERS (cont.) - Turkey will invite bids Dec 10 to import 200,000 tonnes of red and white milling wheat on a three-year credit basis, a grain official said. He said the imports would be from either the U.S., Australia, Argentina or any EU member country.</p>
<p>- Sri Lanka is expected to soon seek 100,000 tonnes of optional origin wheat for delivery in January and February.</p>
<p>BARLEY TENDER - Jordan is expected to tender later this month for 50,000 tonnes optional origin barley slated for January shipment, several U.S. exporters said.  </p>
<p>MARKET TALK - Iraq's Minister of Trade Mohammed Mehdi Saleh on Sunday said wheat was the main component of two million tonnes of commodities it will buy under a six-month, $2 billion U.N. oil-for-food deal.</p>
<p>"Our imports under the memorandum are around two million tonnes, which will ensure the operation of Umm Qasr and Aqaba port," Saleh said the mechanism of the U.N. deal allowing Iraq to sell oil worth $2 billion over six months to pay for food and medicine. Saleh said Iraq would be importing 1.2 million tonnes of wheat, 340,000 tonnes of rice and 300,000 tonnes of sugar over the six-month period.  </p>
<p>... Japanese traders said on Monday they were increasingly interested in the cheaper Brazilian soybean crop as buyers continue ahead of the Christmas holidays to purchase U.S. soybeans for February shipment. "Japan already bought up to 160,000 tonnes of Brazilian soybeans for shipments after next April. The Brazilian crop has higher protein than the U.S. and has no quality problems," a soybean trader said.</p>
