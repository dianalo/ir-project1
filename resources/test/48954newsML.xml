<p>Local police in a Serb- held town promised on Thursday to let Moslem refugees return to vote unhindered -- an apparent reversal of the trend towards nationalist threats of violence in the countdown to Bosnia's post-war elections this weekend.</p>
<p>"An agreement on security during the election has been reached on higher and local levels," a police officer in north Bosnian Serb stronghold of Doboj told Reuters. "I am convinced there will be no incidents on Saturday."</p>
<p>Doboj, a strategic northern road junction and industrial town, had a Moslem-Croat majority before the war. Most were expelled during the Serb conquest of northern Bosnia in 1992.</p>
<p>The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which is running Bosnia's first post-war election, hopes it will produce a democratic nucleus capable of peacefuly rebuilding a united country.</p>
<p>The voting is to elect a supreme three-member presidency and parliament, separate assemblies for the Moslem-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic, and cantonal assemblies.</p>
<p>To add logistical and security complications to the polling, thousands of refugees displaced by almost three years of fighting, will return to their homes from all over the country and in neighbouring Serbia.</p>
<p>But Serb police in Doboj said they expected no problems from their former Moslem neighbours due to visit the town briefly on election day.</p>
<p>"Our people have been given strict instructions how to behave, not to respond to potential provocations," he said.</p>
<p>Doboj Moslems say only last Wednesday they had been told they could cross former frontlines and vote in their hometown.</p>
<p>Saban Klokic, who heads the local election commission in Doboj East, a municipality in federal territory where most of Doboj's Moslem refugees are located said 3,000 to 4,000 people could return.</p>
<p>"We are not afraid of incidents. NATO will be there and the Serbs will keep quiet that day. But try to go there on another day and you will get a blow on the head," he said.</p>
<p>But a member of Serb election commission in Doboj said the Moslems would be controlled.</p>
<p>"They can cast their ballots at any polling stations, but we designated two special stations for them, which are closer to the boundary with the federation," said commission official Milena Panic.</p>
<p>NATO forces, fearing the influx will spark violence, will be on full alert on polling day. International observers say despite official orders, it may be virtually impossible to stop individuals from acting on their own.</p>
<p>The OSCE has indefinitely postponed municipal elections after irregularites in voter registration were reported. The move has discouraged a large number of refugees from using their right to vote in their hometown, said Mujkanovic.</p>
<p>Panic said altogether 52,000 people were registered to vote in Doboj municipality. But 19,000 of them would be Bosnian Serb refugees now living in Serbia, using an OSCE rule which allows refugees to vote in a place they "intend" to live.</p>
<p>Many of those Serbs are not from Doboj, an OSCE official said. Election observers have accused Serbs of abusing the rules to cement political control over towns they captured in war.</p>
<p>The dominant Bosnian Croat party didn't even nominate candidates for the assembly in the Serb republic, although a large number of Croats lived in the region before the war.</p>
<p>"Moslems parties don't stand a chance here," a policeman said. "Only Serbs can win," he said.</p>
