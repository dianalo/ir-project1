<p>Large Thai finance and securities firm Phatra Thanakit Plc was unaffected by the central bank's decision to float the baht on Wednesday, the company said in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>Phatra said its own $315 million in foreign liabilities were protected from foreign exchange risk. It had advanced a further $58.40 million to clients which had assumed the risks themselves, the statement said.</p>
<p>Most clients had protected their loans against exchange fluctuations or had U.S. dollar revenues, Phatra said.</p>
