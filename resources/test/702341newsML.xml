<p>European Union Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler called on Wednesday for further discussion on demands for a total ban on meat and bone meal in animal feed.</p>
<p>Winding up a two-day international scientific conference, Fischler said further examination was also needed of measures to ensure that only material from healthy animals was used in animal feed.</p>
<p>"We intend to issue discussion papers on these two points," Fischler said.</p>
<p>Infected meat and bone meal is believed to be the main cause of the fatal cattle brain disease, known medically as Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), which has ravaged mainly British herds.</p>
<p>Britain's disclosure in March 1996 that BSE might be caught by humans in the form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), through eating infected beef, spread panic across Europe and sent prices crashing.</p>
<p>In 1994, the European Union banned the mixing of ground-up mammals in feed for grass-eating cattle, sheep and goats. Consumer groups and some scientists are now demanding that the ban be extended to pig, poultry and fish feed.</p>
<p>But Fischler said economic and environmental factors must also be considered -- production of meat and bone meal helps to dispose of huge quantities of animal waste.</p>
<p>The EU produces nearly three million tonnes of meat and bone meal annually to provide protein for animal feed. This comes from nearly 19 million tonnes of animal waste tissue and carcasses.</p>
<p>Fischler noted he had resubmitted a proposal to ban BSE-risky animal parts -- brains, eyes and spinal cord -- of cattle, sheep and goats from human and animal food.</p>
<p>Consumer groups urged great caution on food safety, saying there were still many unanswered scientific questions, such as how BSE was transmitted, as well as the extent of the disease, notably on the continent, and its effects on human health.</p>
<p>"Food policy cannot be based only on science and must take into account consumers' preferences, expectations, emotions and sentiments in relation to food," said Jim Murray, Director of the European Consumers' Organisation (BEUC).</p>
