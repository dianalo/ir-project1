<p>Colombia's state-run Financiera Energetica Nacional FEN has agreed to grant a $160 million credit to the state oil company Ecopetrol, a Finance Ministry official said Thursday.</p>
<p>The official, who spoke on the sidelines of the Colombian Banking Association's annual meeting in this colonial port city, gave few details, saying credit terms were still being ironed out by FEN and Ecopetrol.</p>
<p>FEN has traditionally provided financing for development of the electrical sector and the credit for Ecopetrol would be its first, according to the Finance Ministry official.</p>
<p>He said at least $80 million of the credit would be granted in dollars, payable within five years, and the rest was likely to be disbursed in pesos.</p>
