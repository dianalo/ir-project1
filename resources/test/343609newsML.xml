<p>The venture capital firm Hungarian-American Enterprise Fund (HAEF) said it would replace Charles Huebner as managing director at its Budapest office, HAEF said in a statement.</p>
<p>Huebner's job will be taken over by Zoltan Szemerey, an engineer and former ABB manager, the statement said.</p>
<p>It did not indicate when the staff change would take place or where Huebner would go. It, however, quoted HAEF CEO E. R. Scocimara as saying that he was "grateful for the dedicated role Charles Huebner has played in organising and managing HAEF's Budapest office."</p>
<p>HAEF was set up by the U.S. government with $60 million of American public funds in 1990 to help ex-communist Hungary build a market economy.</p>
<p>The statement said that HAEF will transform its Budapest office into a separate legal entity that would provide investment advise to HAEF and other investors.</p>
