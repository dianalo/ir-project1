<p>Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the European Commission on Thursday:</p>
<p>Spokesman Thierry Daman said the Commission had adopted a communication on preferential accords with third countries in the framework of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p>Daman also said there would be a technical briefing in Italian on social funds in Italy at 1500/1400 GMT in the Breydel building, office No 256.</p>
<p>Spokesman Peter Guilford briefed on the EU/Japan agreement on the music copyright dispute. He said the Japanese parliament had agreed last month to backdate to 50 years ago its intellectual property protection rules. He said the Commission would examine the legislative action and consult the industry experts and if satisfied, it will withdraw its WTO complaint.</p>
<p>In answer to a question, Guilford said that some improvement had been made during Wednesday's WTO telecoms negotiations but that there was still a long way to go. Guilford denied reports that the EU was excluding audiovisual services.  He said the WTO would only discuss passing of signals and not their contents.</p>
<p>Spokesman Willy Helin said Commissioner Karel Van Miert would meet with Italian Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi on Monday around 1200/1100 GMT and that there would probably be a briefing after the meeting.</p>
<p>Spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas briefed on other results of today's Commission meeting. He said it had discussed Commission President Jacques Santer's proposals to the European Parliament on BSE, the British Airways/American Airlines alliance and flexibility in the framework of the inter-governmental conference (see separate article BC-IGC-FLEXIBILITY).</p>
<p>In answer to a question spokeswoman Elisabetta Olivi said the Ecofin Council had started work on a potential harmonised taxation system and that the Dublin European Council had launched a permanent group on taxation policy. Olivi also said that there were no discussions on income tax foreseen.</p>
