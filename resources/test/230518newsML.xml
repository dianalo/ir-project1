<p>Global bond markets strengthened on Tuesday, benefiting from a strong dollar and a year-end shift by investors out of cash and into debt assets.</p>
<p>Speculation the Bundesbank might cut interest rates in the months ahead was dealt a blow by comments from the central bank, but the tone in bond markets remained firm.</p>
<p>"No one will want to close their books with cash in the balance sheet," said Stephen Lewis, director of research at London Bond Broking Co (LBB). "Once we get through this week the markets will probably die down."</p>
<p>December Bund futures raced to another all-time high on Tuesday, their fourth such high in the past five sessions.</p>
<p>December Bunds settled at 102.65, up 18 basis points from the previous close. Earlier in the session they surged to 102.99, surpassing the 102.71 record high reached on Friday.</p>
<p>December Italian bonds finished at 129.54, up 0.48 from Monday. The French December notionnel settled at 129.82, up 0.40, while December British gilts lost a half-point gain early in the session and ended the day 1/32 lower at 111-31.</p>
<p>The dollar's latest gains spurred the markets on.</p>
<p>"The dollar was so well bid we knew the Italian and Spanish markets were going to come in well bid," said Mark Bays, a futures broker on the LIFFE floor for MeesPierson Derivatives.</p>
<p>"The market just seems to have an insatiable demand for paper at the moment."</p>
<p>The dollar reached a 23-month peak of 1.5735 marks on Tuesday. It finished European trading at 1.6562/72 marks, up from 1.5450 at the prior European close.</p>
<p>Peripheral markets such as Italian BTPs and Spanish Bonos typically benefit from dollar strength because their currencies tend to ride on its coat-tails and make gains against the mark.</p>
<p>The latest dollar gains came after Bundesbank chief economist Otmar Issing said on Monday that one possible effect of the approach to a single European currency was a shift out of the mark and into dollar-denominated investments.</p>
<p>As well as bolstering European bonds, the dollar has helped a more obvious candidate -- U.S. Treasury bonds. The 30-year benchmark long bond was at 102-11 to yield 6.32 percent, compared with 101-26 in Tokyo and 101-27 in New York on Monday.</p>
<p>Japanese yields are also flirting with record lows. Gross domestic product (GDP) numbers on Tuesday rose a real 0.1 percent or an annualised 0.4 percent in the July-September period. Analysts said this reinforced the idea that interest rates do not need to rise soon.</p>
<p>French and German bond markets have been helped by continuing speculation that German interest rates may fall once more, allowing the Bank of France to follow suit and give a boost to a flagging French economy.</p>
<p>The Bundesbank doused some of this speculation, when it declined to comment on the market gossip but pointed instead to earlier comments by its president, Hans Tietmeyer, that rates would remain steady in the short term.</p>
<p>Chief Bundesbank spokesman Manfred Koerber noted this week's Spiegel magazine, in which Tietmeyer was quoted as saying he saw no short-term reason for another interest rate change.</p>
<p>Sonia Gibbs, bond strategist at Nomura International in London, said failure to reach agreement on a budgetary discipline pact at a European finance ministers meeting on Monday was also helping bond markets.</p>
<p>"They didn't come to an agreement on the stability pact and it does look like Germany is going to have to give in. That just makes it easier for everyone," she said.</p>
<p>Germany has been calling for a strict system of fines if countries in European economic and monetary union (EMU) do not maintain fiscal discipline. Gibbs said the market is taking the view now that Germany may compromise on this issue.</p>
<p>"Right or wrong, this is the perception that's come from a lack of agreement," she said. "If you factor in lower rates in France and Germany, a stronger dollar and this idea of a broad EMU then there's no stopping bond markets."</p>
