<headline>Ethyl sees H2 lead anti-knock profits down.</headline>

<p>Ethyl Corp said Tuesday that, although it expects to see improvement in petroleum additives in 1997, its lead anti-knock profits will be "well below" the second half of last year.</p>
<p>The company said improvements in its results for the first half of the year were largely offset by the expected lower lead antiknock profit. The lower profits reflect a continuing market decline, competitive pressures in the petroleum additives marketplace and the strength of the U.S. dollar, the company said.</p>
<p>"Ethyl Corp delivered a nine percent improvement in earnings for the first half and second quarter of 1997 compared with the same periods last year, despite challenging conditions in the petroleum additives business," said Bruce Gottwald, chairman and chief executive, in a statement.</p>
<p>Ethyl posted second-quarter net income of $21.9 million, or $0.19 per share, compared to net income of $20.1 million, or $0.17 per share.</p>
<p>The company sells fuel and lubricant additives to refiners who sell petroleum products for transportation and industrial equipment.</p>
