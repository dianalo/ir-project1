<p>Clark Refining and Marketing Co said it stepped up production at its 80,515 barrel per day Blue Island, Ill., refinery after restarting a fluid catalytic cracker idled since a mid-October explosion and fire.</p>
<p>The company said an alkylation unit had not been restarted, but gasoline production was doubled to about two million gallons a day as the fluid catalytic cracker resumed operations.</p>
<p>"That's our normal capacity and we should be just about there," a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>An Illinois court on November 8 cleared the way for Clark to resume normal production levels after dismissing a lawsuit filed by state regulators seeking to idle the refinery, a key producer in the Chicago market.</p>
<p>Clark had come under fire following an October 19 explosion and fire that idled the alkylation unit and a propane scrubber. The explosion was the third headline-grabbing accident at the plant in the past two years.</p>
<p>Unleaded gasoline basis surged to 8.50 cents a gallon over front-month gasoline futures on the threat the refinery would be shut, and has eased back little since the court decision, traders said.</p>
<p>Clark Refining and Marketing is an operating unit of St. Louis-based Clark USA, itself a subsidiary of Tornoto-based Trizec-Hahn Corp.</p>
