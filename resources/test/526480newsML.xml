<p>Japan's diffusion index of leading economic indicators stood at 44.4 on a scale of 100 in February, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said on Monday.  </p>
<p>A breakdown of the indices of economic indicators follows:</p>
<p>					     FEB	 JAN (REVISED)</p>
<p>    Leading index			44.4	 44.4</p>
<p>    Coincident index		   75.0	 90.0</p>
<p>    Lagging index			 0.0	 42.9</p>
<p>The index of leading indicators was below 50 for the second successive month in February.</p>
<p>The index of coincident indicators was above 50 for the sixth month in a row, while the lagging indicators index was below 50 for the second successive month.</p>
<p>A figure for the index of leading economic indicators above 50, the so-called "boom or bust" mark, is generally taken as suggesting the economy will expand in the coming months, while a figure below 50 suggests the economy will contract in the coming months.</p>
<p>The coincident index measures current economic conditions, while the lagging index traces economic trends in the past few months.</p>
