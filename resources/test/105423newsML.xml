<p>The federal government levied Wednesday its largest criminal fine ever in the health care field against Damon Clinical Laboratories Inc., charging the Corning Inc. unit defrauded the Medicare programme, the U.S. Attorney's office in Boston said.</p>
<p>Corning agreed to pay a $119 million fine, including $35.3 million in criminal charges and $83.7 million in civil liabilities, subject to approval by a federal judge on Thursday, U.S. Attorney Donald Stern told reporters in Boston.</p>
<p>Needham, Mass.-based Damon, purchased by Corning in August 1993 for about $370 million, defrauded the government health care programme between January 1988 and August 1993 in reaction to declining profits and a changing marketplace, he said.</p>
<p>Damon, which operated blood testing clinics in 10 states, submitted millions of fradulent claims for medically unnecessary laboratory tests to federal and state health care programmes, he said.</p>
<p>Damon added three additional blood tests to a series of tests called a "LabScan," and billed Medicare for the unnecessary expense, Stern said.</p>
<p>"The LabScan ... quickly became a lab scam," Stern said. "This is a case, pure and simple, of corporate greed run amok. Damon bundled the tests together for the sole purpose of stealing money from the Medicare programme."</p>
<p>Stern said the government fined Damon $3 for every $1 the company overcharged healthcare programmes.</p>
<p>Corning said Wednesday it would take an after-tax charge $115 million against its third-quarter earnings in its health care services segment as a result of the fine.</p>
<p>"We are very disappointed with the final amount of this settlement," Corning Chief Executive Roger Ackerman said in a statement.</p>
<p>Corning said the fine would have no impact on the company's plan to spin off its clinical laboratory business, Corning Clinical Laboratories, as planned before year-end. Damon no longer conducts business, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Three "whistleblowers" who alerted the government to the scam will share in the government's recovery in accordance with the federal False Claims Act statute.</p>
<p>Jeanne Byrne, a former Damon sales representative, will receive $9 million and Jack Dowden and Kevin Spear, who were former salesmen at one of Damon's competitors, will share $1.47 million.</p>
<p>Corning cooperated with the investigation and no employees at the company will be charged, Stern said.</p>
<p>"When Corning purchased Damon, the practice stopped," Stern said. Corning has since established a model compliance programme, he added.</p>
<p>Stern said the investigation is continuing and the government may consider criminal charges against Damon executives who took part in the conspiracy.</p>
