<p>Bucharest share prices shot up on Tuesday in a bullish trend which gripped the market five sessions ago.</p>
<p>Turnover soared by around 73 million lei to 158.3 million.</p>
<p>"High inflation last year prompted the rally, making prices of 5,000 lei per share ridiculously low," said a trader.</p>
<p>Year-on-year inflation was 56.9 percent in December, almost double an anticipated rate of 30 percent.</p>
<p>"Also, the depreciation of the leu has had an impact on the market," another trader said.</p>
<p>The leu currency has fallen by around 35 percent since January 1 to a present interbank rate of $1=5,450/500.</p>
<p>Brokers said fresh investment in the market had revived trading, which was sluggish for most of last year.</p>
<p>"We can talk of institutional investors now and, finally, of foreign investors who have been absent from the market so far," said a broker.</p>
<p>"The new, reformist government seems to have been good news for foreign investors," he added, referring to a centrist coalition which took power after polls last November.</p>
<p>Brokers said turnover would have been a lot higher if there had been more offers. "Investors bought everything thrown into the market, the offer for most stocks was nil for half today's session," one said.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected the bullish mood to continue on Thursday and then to be followed by profit-taking.</p>
<p>Fertiliser maker Azomures SA dominated trading, with 86 percent of turnover. It closed 1,700 lei up at 18,900.</p>
<p>Two stocks had no trade and syringe maker Sanevit SA remained suspended pending an announcement.</p>
<p>Two unofficial indices - the VAB and the BIG -- rose by 6.0 and respectively 5.6 percent from the previous session.</p>
