<p>Hanshin Bank Ltd said on Friday that it planned to write off 20.6 billion yen worth of problem loans in the year to March 31, and added that it aimed to complete write-offs of all of its problem loans by the end of March 1998.  </p>
<p>Hanshin originally planned to write off 14.4 billion yen of problem loans in 1996/97, the bank said in a statement.</p>
<p>The bank's problem loans as of March 31 are expected to total 50 billion yen, down from 72.9 billion yen a year ago.</p>
<p>Hanshin said earlier on Friday that it would post parent current and net losses in 1996/97 but it said that it would be able to post more than 10 billion yen in operating profits in 1996/97.</p>
<p>Hanshin said the current and net losses would result from early write-offs of problem loans, and the bank considered the losses as "positive steps" to improve its business.</p>
<p>The bank also said that it hoped to receive full support from Sakura Bank Ltd.</p>
<p>It said it was asking Sakura to provide 20 billion yen in subordinated loans. Hanshin said it believed Sakura would agree.</p>
<p>Hanshin also said that it planned further restructuring steps, including a cut in its work force by 20 percent to 980 eventually.</p>
<p>It said it would continue a freeze on base wages and would review its wage structure.</p>
