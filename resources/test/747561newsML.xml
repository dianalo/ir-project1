<p>Seven Burmese students-in-exile on Tuesday launched a hunger strike outside the Malaysian embassy in Bangkok to protest against ASEAN's decision to admit Burma.</p>
<p>The students vowed to continue their action until the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), which this week admits Burma as a member, reversed its decision.</p>
<p>They demanded that ASEAN consult the Burmese opposition National League for Democracy (NLD) party led by Aung San Suu Kyi and negotiated the release of political prisoners with Burma's ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC).</p>
<p>The students wanted ASEAN to oversee the transfer of power from the military to the NLD, which swept the 1990 general election in Burma but whose victory was not recognised by the military.</p>
<p>Each student wore a placard bearing the name of an ASEAN member country around his neck.</p>
<p>"In order to draw world-wide attention to the shame of ASEAN's acceptance of the SLORC, we, a coalition of Thai and Burmese student organisations, have decided to stage a hunger strike," a statement from the students said.</p>
<p>"We will continue to protest against Burma's relationship with ASEAN until our demands have been met," it added.</p>
<p>ASEAN now groups Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines, Brunei and Vietnam.</p>
