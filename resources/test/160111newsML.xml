<headline>KCBT wheat ends lower after late liquidation.</headline>

<p>KCBT hard red winter wheat futures drifted for most of the session on a lack of news, but ended lower after a late bout of commission-type liquidation, traders said.</p>
<p>"FIMAT turned seller late in the day. They sold about 6-1/2 million bushels in the last 30 minutes of the session," a trader said. "Dreyfus held it up, along with the locals, who were definitely buying the back months."</p>
<p>There was little news to move Friday's market, and traders said volumes were substantially lighter than those seen during Thursday's sell-off.</p>
<p>KCBT wheat settled 3-1/2 cents per bushel lower to one cent higher, with December down 3-1/2 cents at $4.01. New contract lows were set in all months out to May 1997, with Dec setting a new low at $3.98.</p>
<p>Traders said the Dec/March spread narrowed to 18 cents late, after having traded at 21 cents earlier.</p>
<p>FIMAT sold 2.1 million Dec, 2.6 million March, 1.7 million May and 1.4 million July. CIS bought 2.5 million Dec bushels. Term Commodities bought two million July. General Mills bull-spread 1.6 million Dec/March bushels at 19 to 21 cents.</p>
