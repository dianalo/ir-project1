<p>The dollar is expected to remain under downward pressure against the yen in Asia on Thursday, after falling to a seven-month low of 110.62 yen in London overnight.</p>
<p>Short-covering could provide the dollar with some support, but the U.S. currency is expected to be capped by selling interest from Japanese exporters and institutional investors above 112 yen, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The dollar is more likely to test the downside today. Even if it shows a recovery, it is unlikely to reach 112 yen," a city bank trader said.  </p>
<p>Uncertainty about the future of a single European currency is expected to weigh on European currencies against the yen, dealers said.</p>
<p>The mark fell to a 21-month low of around 64.69 yen overnight.</p>
<p>The dollar stayed in a narrow range against the mark overnight and is expected to remain relatively stable during Asian trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers in Tokyo are awaiting a meeting of European Union leaders in Amsterdam next Monday and Tuesday.</p>
