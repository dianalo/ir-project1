<p>Germany's main employers federation said it was hopeful it could agree with trade unions changes to Germany's system of collective bargaining that would allow firms to include clauses specific to their business needs.</p>
<p>German firms have long complained that the system under which employer and union representatives negotiate wage agreements that apply across a given industry sector disadvantage some firms, especially small or struggling ones.</p>
<p>"The wage negotiators themselves now must and can agree (to make sector-wide agreements more flexible)," Dieter Hundt, president of the BDA federation of German employers told a news briefing late on Thursday.</p>
<p>Hundt said sector-wide contracts should be seen merely as "base agreements" on top of which firms should be free to negotiate clauses that apply to them alone.</p>
<p>Metal and engineering sector union IG Metall, the country's largest with close to three million members, was earlier this week reported to be willing to drop its opposition to company-specific clauses under certain conditions.</p>
<p>IG Metall has not confirmed the reports but a spokeswoman said on Friday the union would be holding talks with the Gesamtmetall metal employers federation "in the near future".</p>
<p>Employers want to be allowed to institute special clauses in employee contracts that would, for example, allow them to cut working hours in times of slack business.</p>
<p>Trade unions are meanwhile pushing for firms to reduce the amount of overtime worked by Germans, which reached 1.8 billion hours in 1996, a level which even Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been moved to criticise as unacceptable.</p>
<p>Following publication on Thursday of a new post-war unemployment record in Germany, firms should think more about taking on extra workers rather than demanding that their existing workforces work longer hours.</p>
