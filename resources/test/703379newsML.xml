<p>Germany's Kirch Group, which on Wednesday bought an additional 37.5 percent stake in pay-television broadcoaster Premiere, will sell one third of that stake to Bertelsmann affiliate CLT-UFA, Premiere said.</p>
<p>The transaction is part of a deal between Kirch and CLT-UFA announced last week to split control over Premiere 50-50.  </p>
<p>Bertelsmann and Canal Plus each held 37.5 percent of Premiere, and Kirch 25 percent. After the complex share deal, CLT-UFA and Kirch will each hold 50 percent.</p>
<p>Canal Plus agreed to sell the shares to Kirch while it acquired Kirch's 45 percent stake in Italy's Telepiu.</p>
<p>Telecommunications giant Deutsche Telekom AG, which operates Germany's only nationwide cable television network, said earlier it had reached a deal with Kirch and CLT-UFA to launch digital television in Germany.</p>
<p>The three will participate in a venture that developed the basic decoder technology.</p>
