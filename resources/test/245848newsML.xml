<p>Flights in and out of Kenyan airports ran late on Tuesday for the fourth straight day because of a strike by air traffic controllers, airport sources said.</p>
<p>An official from the Ministry of Transport and Communciations warned the strikers to go back to work or they would be considered in breach of their contracts.</p>
<p>"The permanent secretary in the ministry, Stanley Murage, has told the air traffic controllers they must return to work by 4 p.m. local (1300 GMT) today (Tuesday) or else they will be in breach of their work contracts," a ministry spokesman said.</p>
<p>The civil aviation authorities have replaced the strikers with instructors and administrators who are short of practical experience.</p>
<p>Airline officials said some international flights left Nairobi up to one hour late because the substitute air traffic controllers could not handle the workload.</p>
<p>"They don't have enough manpower and they are not that experienced but they are doing their best," one official said.</p>
<p>Kenya Airways has told travel agents that its flights to and from the Lake Victoria town of Kisumu will run one hour behind schedule, the travel agents said.</p>
<p>The ministry spokesman said the air traffic controllers wanted their basic salaries increased 50-fold to 261,510 shillings ($4,670) from 5,000 shillings ($90) a month.</p>
<p>- $1 = 56 shillings</p>
