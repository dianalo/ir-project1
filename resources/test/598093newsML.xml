<headline>Harriman auction continues to bring high prices.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-05-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>The auction of items from the estate of former U.S. Ambassador to France Pamela Harriman at Sotheby's continued to draw far higher prices than estimated on Tuesday, although bidding was slightly quieter than Monday's wild opening session.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning's session netted $774,640 while the afternoon session brought in $467,728, making the total for three of the six session $5,925,950 -- or what the total sale was originally estimated to bring.</p>
<p>Most items on the block on Tuesday morning went for far more than the top estimated price listed in the catalogue.</p>
<p>A Louis XVI style ormolu-mounted mahogany gueridon went for $32,200 as the top price, six times more than the estimated high bid.</p>
<p>A pair of Louis Philippe elmwood and pine armchairs dating from the 19th century went for $23,000, more than ten times the anticipated high bid.</p>
<p>A bronze Iranian votive figure from the ninth century B.C. was sold for $29,900 and a pair of Italian Neoclassical giltwood small consoles went for $27,600. A pair of Swedish neoclassical brass-mounted candelabra went for $25,300.</p>
<p>Harriman, a former daughter-in-law of Winston Churchill and the widow of W. Averell Harriman, a former U.S. ambassador to Moscow, died in February at age 76.</p>
