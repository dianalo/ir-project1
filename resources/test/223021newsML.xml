<p>CRA-ACC Exploration Ltd, a joint venture between India's Associated Cement Companies and CRA Ltd of Australia will begin prospecting for precious metals in India in the next six months, its chairman said.</p>
<p>Subrato Ganguly, chairman of the joint venture equally owned by ACC and CRA, said this was the first firm approved by the government after new guidelines on private entry into mining came into effect earlier this month.</p>
<p>The new rules on private participation limit foreign ownership in mining firms to 50 percent. It stipulates that mining lease in one location should not exceed 5,000 km and should not exceed a total of 10,000 km in the country.</p>
<p>Ganguly said prospecting and finding gold would be a long drawn out affair and small firms should be wary of this sector.</p>
<p>"There is little point going for mining if business is less than 5.0 billion rupees a year," he said.</p>
<p>ACC has told CRA it would also be interested in coal, iron and base metals, he said. ACC, on its own, plans to begin coal mining and is now seeking environmental clearance, he said.</p>
<p>CRA-ACC will initially focus on the four states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.</p>
