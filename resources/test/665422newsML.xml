<p>One day before the House Banking Committee formally considers legislation to overhaul U.S. financial laws, committee chairman Jim Leach said such measures historically face strong opposition.</p>
<p>"Prospects are always dicey," Leach said on Monday in an interview on Reuters Financial Television. "To get all the parties together and also make sure the public interest is advanced is a very difficult art form."</p>
<p>The banking panel will begin considering financial modernization legislation on Tuesday afternoon.  </p>
<p>At Tuesday's bank reform mark-up, lawmakers intend to introduce dozens of amendments on a wide array of topics.</p>
<p>Leach said committee members have not reached a consensus on the amount and type of regulation that would be appropriate for banks and other financial service companies.</p>
<p>"My view is that you ought to homogonize these rights so that no part of the financial community has an advantage over another," Leach said. But other members disagree, Leach said.</p>
<p>"There are some that argue that is not the way to go and they will have amendments of a different type," Leach added. "I'd be hesitant to predict the result."</p>
<p>In the interview, Leach also said the banking committee would consider legislation on bank automated teller fees. And the Iowa Republican said he wouldn be "very wary" about further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.</p>
