<p>A member of the Bank of France's Monetary Policy Council called on Thursday for the addition of a "sixth criterion" on employment to Maastricht treaty requirements for membership of European monetary union.</p>
<p>Paul Marchelli said that instead of arguing about details or worrying about the next election, politicians in France should attack the problems of the real economy.</p>
<p>"They could show that they are determined to participate without ambiguity in the contruction of Europe. Let them become promoters of a true European social pact. Let them demand the creation of the sixth criterion which was forgotten at Maastricht -- Employment," he wrote, in an article in afternoon daily Le Monde.</p>
