<p>England captain Alan Shearer produced a memorable 14-minute hat-trick to keep Newcastle United on line for the English premier league title with a dramatic 4-3 win over Leicester City on Sunday.</p>
<p>But they were not the only championship-chasers in Europe to come from behind as Real Madrid, Monaco and Sampdoria also recovered to keep their hopes intact.</p>
<p>England</p>
<p>After 77 minutes, Newcastle were trailing Leicester 3-1 despite having taken the lead in the third minute. But Shearer, a 15 million pounds ($24 million) pre-season buy from Blackburn Rovers stole the points with a dazzling first hat-trick for his new club.</p>
<p>First he rifled home a free-kick and then, with seven minutes remaining, he fired through a sea of legs to level the scores.</p>
<p>In injury time he was on hand to finish from close range to take the three points which leave Newcastle in fourth spot, five points adrift of leaders Manchester United.</p>
<p>Spain</p>
<p>Real Madrid stretched their lead over Barcelona at the top of the Spanish first division to five points by beating Deportivo Coruna 3-2.</p>
<p>Twice Deportivo went ahead through Flavio Conceicao and Corentin Martins but these were quickly cancelled out by Christian Panucci and Fernando Hierro who curled in the equaliser from a free-kick. Davor Suker secured the points for Real.</p>
<p>The result added to the problems of Barcelona coach Bobby Robson, who was summoned to meet club president Jose Luis Nunez after seeing his side throw away a 2-0 lead at home for the second time in less than a month in the 2-2 draw with Oviedo.</p>
<p>Italy</p>
<p>The title race began to heat up as leaders Juventus were held 0-0 by lowly Cagliari while second-placed Sampdoria, reduced to 10 men after the 22nd minute dismissal of goalkeeper Fabrizio Ferron, came back to beat AC Milan 3-2.</p>
<p>Trailing 2-1 after two George Weah strikes, Sampdoria upset the odds when Yugoslavian defender Sinisa Mihajlovic blasted home a free-kick to equalise in the 74th minute and, five minutes later, winger Marco Carparelli added the shock winner.</p>
<p>France</p>
<p>Monaco stayed seven points clear at the top despite having captain Franck Dumas sent off after 55 minutes as midfielder Ali Benarbia scored twice in the space of four minutes to secure a 3-3 draw at Lyon.</p>
<p>Bastia beat Strasbourg 3-1 at home to join Paris St Germain in second place.</p>
