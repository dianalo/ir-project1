<p>The Slovak government is considering tapping foreign sources, including the World Bank, to finance its ambitious infrastructure development plans, a senior official said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"This year's budget will not cover all infrastructure investments, mainly motorway construction, so the government is considering using foreign sources, including the World Bank," an Economics Ministry official, who did not wish to be named, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The government's development programmes for next year include 14 billion crowns for motorway construction and multi-billion crown government guarantees for modernisation of the state-run railway system and hydro-construction projects.</p>
<p>Its 1997 budget sees a deficit of 36.9 billion crowns, up from the 27 billion crown deficit planned for this year.</p>
<p>Naushad Khan, Central Europe procurement specialist for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the World Bank's main lending arm, declined to comment on possible future co-operation between the Slovak government and the World Bank.</p>
<p>"I can only say that the talks (between the IBRD and the Slovak government) are continuing and that we hope that they will lead to further wider co-operation," Khan told Reuters during the seminar.</p>
<p>Khan said the offered loan packages for governments have a 0.5 percent margin over the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and that the IBRD provides credits with maturities of 15 to 17 years.</p>
<p>At a seminar in Bratislava, Khan presented the bank's conditions for businesses willing to take part in IBRD-financed projects and urged Slovak businessmen to take a more active role in such programmes.</p>
<p>"There are several examples of Hungarian companies winning tenders for IBRD-financed projects in former Yugoslavia. There is no reason why Slovak firms could not do the same," he said.</p>
<p>The IBRD has lent Slovakia $230 million in restructuring loans since 1993, and provided the state-owned fixed line telecom operator Slovenske Telekomunikacie with a $50 million loan for its modernisation programme.</p>
