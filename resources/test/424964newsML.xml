<p>South Korea's Kia Motors Corp on Thursday said a purchase of a Belgian automobile assembly plant owned by French car maker Renault SA has never been discussed within the company or with Renault.</p>
<p>However, Kia Motors spokesman Jeun Sang-jin declined to comment on whether the car maker was interested in the buyout.</p>
<p>"All Korean companies are interested. But there has been no discussion of a takeover within the company or with Renault," he said.</p>
<p>Belgian financial daily De Financieel-Economische Tijd on Thursday quoted Chung Jong, Kia Motors Europe's managing director, as saying Kia was interested in buying out but would make a definitive decision after reviewing the books at Renault Industrie Belgique&gt; in Vilvoorde near Brussels.</p>
<p>He said Kia would be seeking output of 150,000 cars a year, which would mean the plant would run at full capacity, the paper said. Chung did not say which model Kia would be making there.</p>
