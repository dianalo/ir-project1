<p>Malaysia's government has no immediate plan to list new subsidiaries of national electricity firm Tenaga Nasional Berhad, Minister of Energy, Post and Telecommunications Leo Moggie said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Moggie confirmed reports that the government has approved Tenaga's plan to set up wholly owned units under a new group structure to take shape on September 1.</p>
<p>"I have seen it (the proposal), discussed it and can go along with it," Moggie told reporters after opening an information technology conference.</p>
<p>Tenaga's restructuring would see two separate companies established, Tenaga Nasional Generation Sdn Bhd and TNB Engineers Sdn Bhd, according to the reports.</p>
<p>Asked if the two could be listed separately, Moggie said: "We should move one step at a time."</p>
<p>"For now, we want Tenaga's business units to be more focused on their individual activities...," Moggie said.</p>
<p>"What we do after that, we'll have to think about it."</p>
<p>The daily Business Times quoted Tenaga Executive Chairman Ahmad Tajuddin Ali as saying last week that Tenaga Nasional Generation will lease, operate and maintain 12 existing power plants owned by Tenaga.</p>
<p>TNB Engineers would provide energy and electricity consultancy. "We will provide start-up capital to the company (TNB Engineers). From there, it can function and acquire business on its own...," Ahmad was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Ahmad told the newspaper that Tenaga, as the holding company, would retain the generation, transmission and distribution license.</p>
<p>Moggie said the restructuring takes into account global trends in separating electricity generation activities from transmission and distribution functions.</p>
<p>He said Tenaga would remain "as one strategic company bringing power throughout the country".</p>
<p>"The first thing is for Tenaga to set up its own subsidiaries," Moggie said, adding: "It is in line with what we've been thinking."</p>
<p>The proposal was "not something out of the blue" but had grown out of many discussions over a period of time, he said.</p>
<p>The restructuring exercise began not long after an embarrassing 12-to-15 hour blackout over much of peninsular Malaysia last August.</p>
<p>Tenaga said it was caused by a trip in one of its plants that had a cascading effect on the national grid, despite a 40 percent reserve margin of power in the system.</p>
<p>Some called for an end to Tenaga's monopoly on transmission after the blackout, which coincided with the high-profile launch of Malaysia's "Multimedia Super Corridor" for global information technology companies.</p>
<p>Tenaga lost its monopoly on power generation after a similar blackout in 1992 when an inquiry found it had failed to maintain sufficient reserves of power to deal with demand surges.</p>
<p>Ahmad, who took over the utility days after last August's blackout, said at the time he had been told to "look urgently at how Tenaga's operations could be revamped".</p>
<p>The Malaysian government owns about 70 percent of Tenaga's stock.</p>
