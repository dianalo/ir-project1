<p>German shares closed slightly lower on Wednesday after the U.S. Dow Jones index's strong start helped them overcome early weakness caused by renewed tensions between the U.S. and Iraq and interest rate concerns.</p>
<p>The DAX index of Germany's 30 leading blue-chips closed trade 4.15 points, or 0.16 percent, down at 2,566.80 points, practically unchanged from opening levels. The IBIS index of all-day electronic trade ended barely changed at 2,568.70.</p>
<p>The continued firmness of the dollar against the mark provided some support for shares but dealers said the market still risked losing gains made earlier this week.</p>
<p>"The market's been overbought, the dollar's been overbought and people are starting to take profits," said one dealer.</p>
<p>Traders said the market dipped on news of Iraqi attacks on U.S. jets and would be watching carefully whether the strikes would result in a heightening of tension between Washington and Baghdad.</p>
<p>The mood of uncertainty is further set to intensify from Thursday ahead of a raft of U.S. data due on Thursday and Friday which could be taken as a possible influence on U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>"Concern will start making itself felt more from tomorrow," one dealer said, noting the publication of U.S. August producer prices and the latest U.S. money supply data due on Thursday.</p>
<p>Export-led stocks showed early gains because of the higher dollar but later fell back as the dollar edged off its day-highs.</p>
<p>Chemicals group Hoechst AG was one of the few to cling on to gains, ending electronic trade up 70 pfennigs at 53.60 marks.</p>
<p>Shares in car-maker Volkswagen AG closed one mark higher at 562.80 on IBIS after VW chief Ferdinand Piech said he was seeking to to boost the group's productivity by 30 percent.</p>
<p>The comments come after a recent interview with Piech that he was seeking in the coming years to secure a ten-fold increase in VW's current return on sales level.</p>
