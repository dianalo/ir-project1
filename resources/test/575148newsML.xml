<p>The federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) said Monday it proposed a $650,000 fine against Northeast Utilities for more than 70 alleged violations of agency requirements at the Haddam Neck nuclear power plant in Haddam, Conn.</p>
<p>The NRC said in a statement that most of the violations pertained to numerous longstanding deficiencies in engineering programs and practices.  </p>
<p>The Haddam plant, also known as Connecticut Yankee, was shut down last July for safety reasons, and Northeast announced last December that it would permanently close the facility.</p>
<p>The NRC also cited errors related to an event involving a nitrogen buildup in the reactor vessel last year.</p>
<p>None of the matters posed an immediate threat to public safety, the NRC wrote in a letter to Northeast. Still, they reflected "significant departures from the defense-in-depth principles upon which nuclear power plants are designed, built and operated..." the NRC wrote.  </p>
<p>The violations were identified during NRC inspections between November 1995 and November 1996, the commission said.</p>
<p>It said that despite Northeast's decision to permanently close Connecticut Yankee, the fine was necesary to stress "the high regulatory significance the NRC attaches to these violations," and "the need for effective management and oversight during the plant's decommissioning."</p>
<p>The proposed fine includes penalties of $350,000 and $300,000 for separate violations, the NRC said.</p>
<p>It said the $650,000 proposed penalty was the sixth-largest ever suggested by the NRC.  </p>
<p>Northeast has 30 days to pay the proposed fine or to request in writing that all or part of the penalty be withdrawn.</p>
<p>The 582-megawatt (MW) Connecticut Yankee plant was operated and 49-percent owned by Northeast, with the balance owned by seven other New England utilities.</p>
<p>Northeast's three other nuclear plants, in Waterford, Conn., have been closed for safety reasons since March of 1996. The utility has said it plans to have all three ready for restart by early 1998, pending NRC approval.</p>
