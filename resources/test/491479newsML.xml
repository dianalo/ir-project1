<p>French bond futures climbed on Monday as optimism about monetary union helped reverse some of the pessimism which has weighed on European bond markets since talk a delay to the project surfaced recently, analysts said.</p>
<p>Analysts said positive statements about EMU at a weekend meeting of finance ministers, notably comments attributed to German finance minister Theo Waigel that he would not be nailed to a cross of three percent, had renewed confidence in monetary union.</p>
<p>Traders also said the move higher had been accentuated by short covering and a rise in the US bond market.  </p>
<p>"The markets were extremely worried about the euro a few weeks ago, saying they don't like Europe as they don't know where it is going," Eric Chaney, economist at Morgan Stanley in Paris said.</p>
<p>The outcome of the meeting of finance ministers "was very clear and the markets are very pleased by the fact things are going in a well known direction," he said.</p>
<p>Traders also said the strength of the dollar against the mark was seen as being positive for the long end in France. The dollar climbed as high as 1.7133 against the German unit on Monday.  </p>
<p>The rally "has a lot to do with dollar/mark. When the dollar is up people tend to buy (French long-bond futures)," Philippe Brossard, head of research at ABN Amro Finance, said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the mark weakness was positive to the extent it was a reflection of EMU optimism and that dollar strength would also help stimulate European economic growth, increasing the chances of hitting Maastricht deficit targets.</p>
<p>"A stronger dollar is a windfall for European governments trying to keep budget deficits in line with targets. It brings higher growth but also higher consumer taxes," Chaney said.  </p>
<p>"It's the only rational link I would see between a weaker euro and lower bond yields," he said.</p>
<p>The strength of the franc against the mark was also sparking speculation the Bank of France may trim its key intervention rate, possibly this week, to prevent the French unit moving to its central parity, 3.3538, within the European exchange rate mechanism too quickly.</p>
<p>The outperformance of PIBOR contracts compared with German interest rate futures on Monday was at odds with the recent trend which has seen PIBOR suffering from a higher dollar on the grounds there would be less need for cuts to boost growth.  </p>
<p>Joanne Perez, strategist at Merrill Lynch in Paris, was sceptical about the prospect for rate cuts. "I don't think there are any big bets on rate cuts, the only thing that would get market excited is if the dollar slides again."</p>
<p>Chaney said he thought a five basis point cut in the intervention rate was on the cards this week. He said one reason would be that he expected the French inflation rate to fall to a 50-year low and the second being the strength of the franc.</p>
<p>"The Bank of France would be very uncomfortable to have the franc at 3.35 as they would have to defend this position for at least a year," he said.  </p>
<p>Brossard said, "I believe they can cut by five basis points. The currency is strong and when (the central bank) let it go through 3.3700-3.3710 it looked like a signal."</p>
<p>"On top of that, the news on the economy has not been that good and it's harder to maintain the economy is just ahead of a boom," he added.</p>
<p>The franc spiked briefly past 3.3650 per mark, its highest level in nearly four years on Monday. It was trading at 3.3651 late in the session up from 3.3669 on Friday.</p>
