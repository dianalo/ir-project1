<p>British Airways Plc's long-planned alliance with American Airlines suffered a potential setback on Tuesday with indications that the European Commission will join those arguing that the deal should be changed.</p>
<p>European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert met British Trade and Industry Secretary Margaret Beckett in London to discuss the alliance on Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>A Commission source told Reuters the European Union's executive would tell the British government that the planned link-up between BA and American would harm fair competition unless changed.</p>
<p>The report of the EU objection prompted BA to say it would be surprised if the commission would voice such fears to the government, and added that the Commission had not discussed any concerns with the company.</p>
<p>"In the Commission's own words, this work will take some time to complete. It would be very natural for the Commission to discuss their concerns with us before reaching a conclusion and this they have not done," a BA spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>The commission's findings have been expected since January when Van Miert warned the British government in a letter that the alliance would eliminate competition on many key routes between the United States and Britain.</p>
<p>The Commission on Tuesday published draft rules on its jurisdiction over alliances between EU and non-EU airlines. It also followed last week's "Star" alliance between Lufthansa, SAS, United Airlines and others.</p>
<p>The proposed new rules would not come into force before the Star or BA/American deals took effect, however.</p>
<p>Van Miert has threatened the British authorities with legal action if they fail to address the Commission's competition concerns.</p>
<p>Under article 89 of the Treaty of Rome, it must work in cooperation with the British authorities when investigating the case but if needed "it shall propose appropriate measures" to ensure fair competition.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Rome created what is now the EU.</p>
<p>Apart from the complicated mesh of regulatory processes, the planned deal has also come under attack from rival airlines and consumer groups. They say the deal would monopolise transatlantic air services out of London's Heathrow airport, the biggest in Europe.</p>
<p>One central condition to the deal being cleared is the agreement of an open skies deal between the U.S. and British governments liberalising transatlantic flights.</p>
<p>The new British Labour government still has to review that situation since taking power earlier this month.</p>
<p>Philip Butterworth-Hayes, an aviation consultant at Jane's Information Group, said the only likely way BA would get the deal past the Commission would be to hand over more slots from Heathrow to competitors.</p>
<p>"This is very much a test case as to who actually runs the airport and aviation policy in Europe. Is it the government, or is it the European Commission?" he told Reuters Financial Television.</p>
<p>Shares in British Airways, which reported annual results on Monday, were down 18-1/2 pence at 717-1/2.</p>
<p>Separately, US Airways said it would repurchase most of the US Airways preferred stock held by British Airways. BA has a 24.6 percent stake in US Airways, its marketing partner before the proposed deal with American.</p>
