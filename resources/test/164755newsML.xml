<p>Latest European Union figures show grain export commitments between July 1 and October 29 were 10.4 percent below their year-ago level, mostly the result of a sharp decline in wheat sales, member-country officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>The figures, based on delivered export certificates, showed commercial wheat exports sharply lagging on last year at 2.464 million tonnes against 3.453 million.</p>
<p>Flour export commitments reached 1.803 million tonnes down from 2.122 million during the same period last year.</p>
<p>Commercial barley exports, however, jumped to 1.994 million tonnes from 885,000 during the same period last year, helped by sales to Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>Malt exports fell to 1.483 million tonnes from 1.907 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Commercial oat commitments reached 183,000 tonnes. The EU made no oat sales during the same period last year.</p>
<p>Since October 29, the EU has granted 233,700 tonnes of soft wheat, 1,000 tonnes of barley and 14,716 tonnes of rye exports through its weekly grain tender system.</p>
