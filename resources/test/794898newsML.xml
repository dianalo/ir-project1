<p>MP'S CAREER SAFE AS DRIVING COUNT DISCHARGED</p>
<p>A serious driving charge against Federal independent MP Graeme Campbell has been discharged by a court in central western New South Wales.</p>
<p>The charge would have seen the end to Mr Campbell's political career.</p>
<p>The Member for Kalgoorlie was charged with three offences after the car he was driving collided with a motorcycle in Bathurst in October last year.</p>
<p>If convicted of the charge of dangerous driving, Mr Campbell would not have been able to retain his political office.</p>
<p>But in Bathurst Local Court today, the magistrate discharged the matter, finding a jury would be unlikely to convict the MP.</p>
<p>Instead, Mr Campbell has been convicted of a lesser charge of negligent driving and fined $500.</p>

<p>DEMOCRATS TO DELAY ANY MEDIA CHANGES</p>
<p>The Australian Democrats have renewed their threat of staging a Senate inquiry into planned changes to Australia's media ownership laws, a move that could significantly delay any reforms.</p>
<p>Federal Cabinet is today expected to discuss sweeping changes to media rules that could trigger a shake-up in the ownership of some of the country's key media outlets.</p>
<p>It has been suggested the reforms could require media proprietors to argue their case before a new regulatory body when making takeover bids.</p>
<p>While the Government has not held a public inquiry into its planned changes, they may be approved by Cabinet as early as today.</p>

<p>NT CHIEF MINISTER CALLS EARLY ELECTION</p>
<p>Voters in the Northern Territory will go to the polls on August 30.</p>
<p>Territory Chief Minister Shane Stone announced the election in parliament late this morning amid a stormy debate during which a Labor Member was ejected from the house.</p>
<p>The election has been called nine months early. It follows  speculation since March that an early poll would be called. The Country Liberal Party has been in power in the Territory since self-government began in 1978.</p>
<p>Analysts expect this poll to be one of the more interesting campaigns of recent years, with several new players.</p>
<p>Candidates for the two major parties can expect opposition from the Democrats, the Territory Greens and independents, as well as newcomers from the Australia Reform Party and a group of Independent Conservatives generated by the One Nation Party movement.</p>

<p>ACTU ATTACKS GOVT'S SUPER CHANGES</p>
<p>Australian Council of Trade Unions secretary Bill Kelty says Federal Government changes to superannuation will spell an end to employee contributions, which will be a tragedy for retirement savings.</p>
<p>Mr Kelty has told a superannuation seminar in Sydney that employee contributions are already disappearing.</p>
<p>He said recent changes such as opting-out provisions, dropping the co-payment and locking up employee payments until the age of 60, are reducing incentives to invest.</p>
<p>"So at the end of the day employees are going to pay nothing in terms of superannuation in the current arrangement," Mr Kelty said.</p>
<p>"There'll be no purpose for it and no benefit.</p>
<p>"The only thing you have is a return to the Menzies-style savings policy that  Federal Treasurer Peter Costello was able to conjure up in the last budget other than one."</p>
