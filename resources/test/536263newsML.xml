<p>Shares in Swedish forestry group Stora gained slightly after it reported better than expected first quarter earnings, analysts said.</p>
<p>The group's shares rose to a high of 105.5 crowns but was trading 2.5 crowns higher at 104.5 crowns by 1200 GMT.</p>
<p>It earlier said that its first quarter profit fell 54 percent to 560 million crowns, compared with market expectations of a fall to 429 million kroons.</p>
<p>Analysts said they were unlikely to change their forecasts for the group after the Q1 figures.</p>
<p>One analyst said the better than expected results meant the market would be reassured that full-year estimates would be in line with expectations.</p>
