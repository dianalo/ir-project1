<p>Bre-X Minerals Ltd said on Thursday it is ready to start its search for a major mining partner to help the company develop its spectacular Busang deposit in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Bre-X said it will consider a broad range or transactions including a merger, acquisition, joint venture or sale of a majority interest in the gold deposit.  </p>
<p>"Because of the size of reserves and geological potential at Busang, the company's market capitalization and anticipated development costs, Bre-X will shortly seek the participation of a major mining company to facilitate expeditious development of the deposit and enhance its value," Bre-X president David Walsh said in a statement.</p>
<p>Drilling at the Busang deposit has outlined at least 46 million ounces of gold, but experts believe the deposit will be much larger, becoming one of the largest gold deposits in the world.  </p>
<p>The company has said all of the world's major gold companies have shown interest in the deposit.</p>
<p>The major companies have been waiting for Bre-X to consult with its advisers before putting in bids.</p>
