<p>Europe's steel industry, often in crisis over the last 25 years, has emerged in a better competitive shape following structural changes but remains vulnerable to violent business cycle swings, analysts say.</p>
<p>The industry now employs some 300,000 people in the 15-nation European Union following major job losses and capacity cuts, resulting in improved productivity.</p>
<p>This restructuring may be about to speed up following news on Tuesday that German steel and engineering group Krupp plans to launch a hostile takeover bid for rival Thyssen AG which could create a titan with annual turnover of some 63 billion marks ($37.3 billion) .</p>
<p>In contrast to the ailing coal industry, which was also crucial to the reconstruction of western Europe after World War Two, the steel sector is currently showing profits and survives without vast state support.</p>
<p>Steel analyst Alan Coats at Merrill Lynch said he believed the industry was now competitive on world markets.</p>
<p>"I think the industry is restructuring successfully," he said. "The industry has been doing a lot off detailed restructuring which does not always hit the headlines...a lot has really changed."</p>
<p>Privatisation had also helped make the industry "more efficient than it used to be," said Paribas analyst Gavin O'Donovan, who believes that further consolidation will be a main theme on the European steel market this year.</p>
<p>In addition, ailing steel makers can no longer rely on state bailouts if times get tough as they could in the past.</p>
<p>This was evident in the bankruptcy in January of Belgian steel firm Forges de Clabecq when Belgium's Walloon government, the biggest shareholder in the company, pulled the plug, threatening the jobs of the 1,800 workers.</p>
<p>"The great subsidy time was in the 1980s. Now you really only get subsidies for closing things down," said Coats.</p>
<p>In the past, the EU could be criticised for not being very strict but in the last year or so it had become much more rigorous on state aid to the industry. "If you lose, you lose now. You don't get reincarnated so easily anymore," he said.</p>
<p>Coats said there was still a need to close down some inefficient operations and to restructure areas of the industry.</p>
<p>Steel analysts said the European industry could be headed for a wave of mergers if Krupp was successful in its bid, adding that the sector has too many small players and needs to consolidate further to boost profitability.</p>
<p>In addition, it may further reduce capacity in the sector, which has been plagued by excess capacity. "Consolidation is always a good thing in this industry," said Paribas' O'Donovan.</p>
<p>Apart from being an important industry and employer, the steel sector also played a key role in strengthening European cooperation after 1945.</p>
<p>Reflecting the strategic importance of the two industries, six European countries formed the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) in 1951 to scrap tariffs and quotas on trade.</p>
<p>This was to be the first key step towards what is now the EU, which has been instrumental in transforming the steel industry in the last three decades.</p>
<p>The European Commission has much more powers over the steel industry than it has in other sectors, for example in influencing investments, state aids, production and prices.</p>
<p>Steel production in the EU soared to 156 million tonnes in 1974 from 93 million tons in 1962, but then demand slumped due to the oil price shock which hit economic activity generally and the industry has suffered severe difficulties since then.</p>
<p>As late as in 1994, the EU executive abandoned a rescue plan after steel firms -- partly because of an improving market -- failed to agree to its demands for capacity cuts.</p>
<p>Falling prices hit the industry again in 1995-96 but the market outlook is better for this year.</p>
<p>The sector is "very, very sensitive to the volatile trend" in steel prices, said Coats at Merrill Lynch. "We really need a world market to sell the surplus into."</p>
