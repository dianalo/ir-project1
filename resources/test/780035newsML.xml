<p>COFFEE - World market for August 4, 1997</p>
<p>Robusta futures in London closed sharply higher on speculative buying in New York. September added $42 to close at $1,660 per tonne. November closed $45 higher at $1,655 per tonne. Traders said spread dealings accounted for a significant part of the day's turnover. Fundamental news remained scarce although independent meteorologist Somar said a cold front was forecast in Brazil's coffee producing areas this week. But cloud cover will prevent frosts in the coffee belt and minimum temperatures were forecast at between 8 and 10 degrees Celsius, it said.</p>
<p>Arabica futures in New York closed sharply higher. September added 8.80 cents/lb to close at 193.75 cents/lb, while December closed 6.40 cents/lb higher at 168.70 cents/lb. While no fresh news was seen behind the run-up, traders said ongoing concerns about the availability of exchange-certified coffees for delivery against the September contract continued to underpin the market. Additionally the bi-weekly report by Merill Lynch predicting lean supplies ahead of the new-crop harvest as well as continued dry weather in Central America could push coffee futures over $2, and as high as $2.30-$2.50 if dry conditions in Central America persist, supported sentiment.</p>
<p>FUNDAMENTALS</p>
<p>INDIA - The Indian Commerce Minster recently said there was no need to allow coffee imports as prices have come down from recent peaks and everything is under control. Earlier, government sources indicated that the government may allow the import of coffee in an attempt to force down the retail price of coffee in the country. Nearly 80 per cent of India's coffee production is for export, but the government allows the import of decaffeinated and roasted coffee in the event of domestic scarcity.</p>
<p>COLOMBIA - Colombia is expected to open coffee registrations for September coffee exports next week. Jorge Cardenas, managing director of Colombia's National Coffee Growers Federation said the country would maintain its 30 cents/lb quality premium on its international sales, contradicting market rumours that the premium could be cut to 20 cents to make Colombian beans more competitive. Moreover, official sources said Colombia is on target to produce just under 10 million 60-kg bags in 1996/97 (October/September), down from 12.9 million bags produced the previous year. Production in 1997/98 is forecast to recover to 12.0 million bags.</p>
<p>In order to meet the 1996/97 export schedule the Federation has had to dip heavily into its inventories. Cardenas said those stocks now stood at 4.5 million bags compared to about 6.4 million at the same time last year.</p>
<p>KENYA - According to industry sources coffee production in 1996/97 (October/September) will be around 1.3 million 60-kg bags, sharply down from the 1.626 million bags produced in 1995/96 and 1.597 million bags produced in 1994/95. The fall in production was ascribed to a longer period of drought. Coffee stands third behind tourism and tea as the leading foreign exchange earner. Kenya's share of world trade is about 2.3 per cent but its mild arabicas earn premiums well above world market rates.</p>
<p>TANZANIA - Tanzania exported 697,100 bags of coffee in July/May 1996/97, down from 834,800 bags exported the same period in 1995/96. Total exports in crop year 1995/96 (July/June) reached 934,000 bags, up from 612,000 bags exported in 1994/95. Major countries of destination for green coffee in July/May 1996/97 were Germany (265,100 vs 279,000 bags) and Japan (119,600 vs 167,100 bags).</p>
<p>DENMARK - Denmark imported 105,009 bags of coffee in April 1997, significantly up on the 85,695 bags imported the same month the previous year. That brought total imports since the beginning of 1997 up to 365,700 bags, 6 percent more than was imported the same period in 1996. Total imports in calendar year 1996 rose by 15 percent to 1.008 million bags. Main suppliers of green coffee in January/April 1997 were Brazil (158,700 vs 85,300 bags) and Colombia (63,200 vs 79,000 bags).</p>
<p>The country exported 47,100 bags of coffee in January/April 1997, 48 percent more than was exported the same period in 1996. Total exports in calendar year 1996 rose by 19 percent to 108,100 bags.</p>
