<p>Retired admiral Didier Ratsiraka took office on Sunday following his victory in Madagascar's presidential election last December.</p>
<p>To mark his return to the office that he held for 18 years before being voted out in 1993, Ratsiraka, 60, participated in a service at the Antananarivo Cathedral attended by national leaders, diplomats and visiting personalities.</p>
<p>Ratsiraka narrowly won the December 29 run-off in the presidential election against Albert Zafy -- the man who succeeded him as president in 1993 only to be impeached by his own parliament last year for exceeding his powers under the constitution.</p>
<p>Ratsiraka's 18-year rule ended when Zafy won the island's first multi-party polls in 1993, after months of unprecedented political protest which brought turmoil to the Indian Ocean island republic.</p>
<p>Ratsiraka later went into voluntary exile in France, but returned to run for re-election after Zafy's impeachment.</p>
<p>For most of his first period as president Ratsiraka was a convinced Marxist whose policies helped wreck the economy of the world's fourth-largest island.</p>
<p>Prime minister Norbert Ratsirahonana, who had functioned as acting president pending confirmation of the election result, offered his government's resignation on Saturday.</p>
<p>Officials said his resignation was a formality, intended to leave Ratsiraka, 60, the freedom to pick his own cabinet team. But Ratsirahonana and his ministers will remain in day-to-day charge of government business until a new government is announced.</p>
<p>The National Assembly has been summoned to meet on Monday to enable parliamentary groups to submit a list of candidates from which the president will select the new prime minister, before members of the new government are named.</p>
<p>The managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Michel Camdessus, sent Ratsiraka a message of congratulations, officials said.</p>
<p>Camdessus advised the incoming president of one of the world's poorest countries to "pursue healthy financial policies as the only way left to Madagascar to create, at last, a suitable framework for development and the well-being of its people."</p>
