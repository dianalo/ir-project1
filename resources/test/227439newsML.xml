<p>Indian police released 52 Tibetan exiles detained after a noisy protest outside Beijing's embassy in New Delhi, police officials said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Police said they were held for about four hours on Saturday before being released.</p>
<p>The demonstrators shouted slogans such as "China go out, free Tibet" and burnt the Chinese flag outside the embassy compound in the city's Chanakyapuri area, police said.</p>
<p>The demonstration was one of a series of protests by Tibetan exiles during a three-day state visit to India by Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the first by a Chinese head of state.</p>
<p>Witnesses said a Chinese official came out of the embassy compound and asked police to remove the demonstrators, who were later dragged into police buses and driven away.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, demonstrators in a New Delhi Tibetan encampment burnt an effigy of Jiang and the Chinese flag.</p>
<p>Around 130,000 Tibetans live in India, 4,000 of them in the Indian capital.</p>
<p>Many of them arrived with the Dalai Lama, the Himalayan region's spiritual leader, after an abortive 1959 uprising against China's annexation of Tibet.</p>
<p>The Buddhist spiritual leader has lived in exile in the north Indian Himalayan town of Dharamsala since then.</p>
