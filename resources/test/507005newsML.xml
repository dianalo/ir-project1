<p>International Business Machines Corp said it unveiled IBM SystemCare, calling it the first program to offer customers the ability to acquire, manage and exchange their PCs and other technology assets through computer resellers for a single monthly payment.</p>
<p>IBM executives said that the program, which is aimed at small to medium-sized businesses, will help companies manage their technology assets, avoid obsolescence and save money.</p>
<p>"I believe you can save between 25 to 40 percent (of current technology management costs)," said Sam Palmisano, general manager of IBM PC Co, in a telephone interview.  </p>
<p>Palmisano, who was once the head of IBM's services business, said that the exact savings will depend on what kind of computer systems already installed at a customer's site.</p>
<p>IBM said that SystemCare is a suite of the latest in PC hardware and network management software technologies, competitively priced with flexible financing options, and extensive services and support capabilities.  The IBM Credit Corp will work closely with the PC Co and IBM resellers.</p>
<p>A key feature of the program is the SystemCare Technology Exchange, which allows customers to upgrade their IBM PC hardware after only two years.  </p>
<p>The Gartner Group estimates the total cost of PC ownership at $13,187 annually over a three-year life cycle.</p>
<p>"You have heard a lot about cost of ownership and we are doing more than that," Palmisano said, adding that IBM is not only addressing the changing technology but maintenance, help desk service, local area network monitoring and management.</p>
<p>SystemCare will be marketed exclusively through IBM Business Partners.  Services available from both IBM and its business partners can be combined to meet an individual customer's needs.  SystemCare technology, financing and services are available today, with more offerings to come.</p>
