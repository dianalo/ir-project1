<p>Russia on Friday condemned a sudden swoop on Bosnian Serb war crimes suspects by British soldiers, saying such "cowboy raids" threatened the Dayton peace process.</p>
<p>"Russia does not bear and does not intend to bear any responsibility for the consequences of such unilateral actions," a Foreign Ministry statement said.  </p>
<p>British special forces arrested one suspect and shot dead another on Thursday in the first NATO operation against indicted war criminals since a Bosnian peace treaty was signed in Dayton, Ohio in 1995.</p>
<p>"One must underline that such 'cowboy raids' threaten the whole Dayton Peace process, which is in any case going through a difficult period," said the Russian Foreign Ministry statement, a copy of which was faxed to Reuters.</p>
<p>The statement hinted Russia, whose troops form part of the international SFOR peacekeeping force in Bosnia, might review its participation, saying: "The Russian leadership will draw the corresponding conclusions from this."</p>
<p>The British action appeared to have stunned nationalist Bosnian Seb leaders. Their media accused NATO of "premeditated murder" but there was no immediate violent backlash.</p>
