<title>BRAZIL: Brazil re-election bill goes back to Senate panel.</title>
<headline>Brazil re-election bill goes back to Senate panel.</headline>
<dateline>BRASILIA 1997-05-02</dateline>

<p>A bill which would allow Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to stand for re-election next year will return to a Senate panel after senators proposed amendments, a congressional official said.</p>
<p>Three changes to the constitutional amendment were put forward during a discussion phase on the floor of the upper house, meaning the bill will be sent back to the Constitution and Justice Committee (CCJ), the official said.</p>
<p>The CCJ, which approved the bill in mid-April, has 30 working days to vote on the proposed alterations, she said.  </p>
<p>One change would require state governors and mayors to stand down six months before seeking re-election. That proposal is reported to have the support of a large group of senators who themselves plan to run for state governorships in 1998.</p>
<p>But the government wants to keep the bill as it is because any significant change will require another round of voting in the Chamber of Deputies, where the amendment was passed earlier this year.</p>
<p>Another alteration proposed by senators calls for a referendum on the re-election issue.</p>
<p>If the changes are rejected by the CCJ, the bill requires two three-fifths majorities on the floor of the Senate followed by symbolic approval by a joint session of Congress before becoming law.</p>
