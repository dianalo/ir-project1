<p>Istanbul shares fell in thin trade and continued profit-taking on Friday as the market entered a four-day holiday, but earlier losses were partially recouped on late selective buys, brokers said.</p>
<p>The stock market will be closed on Monday and Tuesday next week due to Republic day and reopen on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The IMKB-100 closed 925.12 points, or 1.11 percent lower at 82,420.98, but sharply above an afternoon low of 81,367. It had eased 0.5 percent in profit-taking on Thursday from Wednesday's all-time high close of 83,772.33.</p>
<p>Trade volume plunged to 12.84 trillion lira from yesterday's 16.12 trillion.</p>
<p>Brokers said selective demand buoyed by nine-month profit outlooks earlier in the week faded as several firms released their results. Companies have to announce their financial tables by today's close the latest and banks by November 8.</p>
<p>"Nine-month profits of some firms were below expectations which also sparked sales," said one dealer.</p>
<p>Activity was subdued ahead of the four-day holiday and sentiment was also undermined by the European Parliament's decision to freeze millions of dollars of aid planned for Turkey as part of its customs union accord with the European Union.</p>
<p>Many brokers expect the index to remain within 81,000-84,000 range in the three trading days next week, with major resistance holding at 85,000.</p>
<p>The index had surged 29.3 percent from September 13 to Wednesday's record close, the tenth record in the medium-term uptrend which began with the breaching of 65,000 level.</p>
<p>Over the week, it gained 0.83 percent after last week's 7.26 percent surge.</p>
<p>Of the 226 shares traded, falls oudid rises by 100 to 69 and 57 finished steady. The 85-share industrial index eased 0.86 percent to 87,064.34 and the 15-share financial index lost 1.65 percent to 79,805.28.</p>
<p>Top actives were utility Aktas Elektrik, up 9,000 lira at 83,000, largely state owned petroleum products marketer Petrol Ofisi, down 4,000 lira at 30,500 and largely state owned flat steel giant Eregli, down 250 lira at 10,500. Together, they made up 28.4 percent of the total turnover.</p>
