<p>Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson has admitted he is unlikely to sign any new players to try to help United win the European Cup before Wednesday's competition transfer deadline.</p>
<p>Ferguson was confirming that United had failed in a bid to sign Norwegian defender Henning Berg from nearby Blackburn for 5.0 million pounds ($8.5 million).</p>
<p>Blackburn told United they did not want to sell Berg after recovering form in recent weeks following their poor start to the season.</p>
<p>Berg, who played a big part in Blackburn's best-of-season 4-0 win over Coventry on Saturday has been a key influence in the revival, which has seen them climb from bottom place to 14th in the standings.</p>
<p>Ferguson said: "We made an inquiry for Berg, but that's all finished now. I don't suppose we will get anyone by Wednesday. It is difficult to find players who are not cup-tied. I think 268 clubs have played in Europe this season and trying to find a player of the quality we are looking for who has not played in Europe is a hard job."</p>
<p>Meanwhile another Scandinavian has joined the growing ranks of players from Norway, Sweden and Denmark playing in the premier league.</p>
<p>Swede Marino Ramberg has joined Derby on loan from Degerfors with a view to a permanent move.</p>
