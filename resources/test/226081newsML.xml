<p>Australia's Golden Valley Mines NL said on Friday the ownership of the Busang gold discovery in Indonesia was still in dispute, contrary to a report in The Australian newspaper on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Golden Valley and PT Krueng Gasui (KG) advise that no agreement exists with either Bre-X or Barrick in respect of KG's interest in the Busang gold deposit," Golden Valley said in a statement.</p>
<p>Golden Valley said the newspaper report which said Busang's Indonesian partners had come to an understanding with Barrick Gold Corp, was without foundation.  </p>
<p>Golden Valley has a technical assistance and financial deal with businessman Joseph Merukh, whose company PT Krueng Gasui (KG) owns an undisputed 10 percent stake in the Muara Atan Contract of Work, which contains part of the Busang deposit.</p>
<p>Merukh claims another 10 percent interest through PT Sungai Atan Perdana and an option for a further 20 percent of Busang.</p>
<p>KG has threatened Calgary-based Bre-X Minerals Ltd, and 19 other companies with legal action in Canadian courts, claiming damages of US$1.9 billion.  </p>
<p>Bre-X claims majority ownership of Busang and says the discovery contains a gold resource of 622 million tonnes of ore at an average grade of 2.34 grams per tonne for 46.92 million ounces of contained gold.</p>
<p>In November, Bre-X said it was advised by the Indonesian government to split the Busang deposit with Barrick Gold.</p>
<p>Bre-X said that Indonesia wanted the Toronto-based Barrick to hold 75 percent of Busang and for Bre-X to complete the deal with Barrick by December 4.  </p>
<p>The Indonesian Mines Ministry also advised Bre-X that the government would appreciate it if the parties could consider a 10 percent participation being given to the Indonesian government.</p>
<p>Golden Valley said Bre-X had failed to meet a deadline of November 22 from KG's Canadian lawyers, requiring its attendance at a meeting with representatives of KG to discuss KG's ownership claims in respect of Busang.  </p>
<p>KG's Canadian lawyers have written to Bre-X's counsel advising that unless meaningful discussions take place by December 2, a statement of claim would be filed in the Court of Queen's Bench of Alberta, Canada, Golden Valley said.</p>
<p>"KG views Barrick's potential involvement in the project very positively and looks forward to the benefits that early development would bring to KG and the other participants," Golden Valley said.  </p>
<p>KG's lawyers had also written to Barrick to draw its attention KG's claim that Bre-X was entitled to deal only with respect to its own 60 percent beneficial interest in the Busang gold deposit and that Bre-X had no authority to represent KG nor deal in any way with KG's interests, Golden Valley said.</p>
<p>"Contrary to some recent press reports, on the basis that Barrick can only obtain from Bre-X a share of Bre-X's beneficial interest, KG does not expect any farm-in or sale agreement to have an adverse effect on KG's interest," Golden Valley said.  </p>
<p>Golden Valley said it was hoped that negotiations with Bre-X and Barrick would lead to a farm-in agreement, based on a proper recognition of the minority interests, which would facilitate the early development of Busang.</p>
<p>At 11.25 a.m. (0025 GMT), Golden Valley shares were half a cent higher at 9.5 cents.</p>
