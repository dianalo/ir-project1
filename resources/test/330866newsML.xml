<p>The following are excerpts from Madeleine Albright's remarks at her first news conference as U.S. Secretary of State on Friday:</p>
<p>CHINA AND HUMAN RIGHTS</p>
<p>I will tell it like it is on the human rights issues and on Hong Kong to the Chinese when I meet with them. I think the important point here is that we understand the importance of Hong Kong as it reverts to China, that it has to be done in a way where the civil and human rights of the people who live in Hong Kong are respected.</p>
<p>I think it's important, on the overall relationship with China, to understand that it is a multi-faceted relationship. It cannot be held hostage to any one issue.</p>
<p>We have a set of issues that we deal with the Chinese, and we have some very positive relations with them and cooperation on, for instance on the issue of North Korea or Cambodia or CTBT/NPT (Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty) but there are some on which we differ, and human rights is one of them.</p>
<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>... achieving a comprehensive peace is a very high priority for the president and therefore also for me. ... I believe that it is important for the secretary of state to be involved in the Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>NATO ENLARGEMENT AND RUSSIA</p>
<p>I think what is very important to keep in mind is the following:  That we believe that it is essential to enlarge NATO. We understand that the Russians have some problems with that. But what is clear is that both countries are committed to working the situation out and develop mutual understanding based on our national interests.</p>
<p>SUDAN</p>
<p>We are very concerned about Sudan's support for terrorist activities.  It is a subject with which I dealt with fairly frequently in New York at the United Nations, and we will continue to insist that Sudan desist from supporting terrorist activities and we'll be following up in New York to try to get additional sanctions.</p>
<p>BOSNIA</p>
<p>... are we going to keep our eye on the ball, which is to make sure that the various aspects of Dayton (the peace accords on Bosnia agreed at Dayton, Ohio in 1995) are carried out? And now I am not in any way underestimating difficulties here ... there are still bumps in the road as far as Bosnia is concerned. ... But I do think again that we have to keep in mind what amazing progress has taken place there and it is as a result of our insistence on carrying out the Dayton accords.</p>
<p>IRAN AND IRAQ CONTAINMENT POLICY</p>
<p>We think that it's very important to make clear that somebody cannot -- nations cannot be involved in terrorism by night and have us deal with them during the day ... we have to watch the actions of those two countries.</p>
<p>CUBA</p>
<p>I myself believe that it is a mistake to have a romantic view of Fidel Castro. He is a dictator who runs his country in the way that dictators did in the '50s and '60s.  Cuba is an embarrassment to the Western Hemisphere, and I think we ought to keep making clear that there needs to be a change there.</p>
