<p>The U.S. Agriculture Department said new meat reinspection procedures with Canada went into effect this week that will strengthen food safety.</p>
<p>USDA said under the new procedures, Canadian inspectors will randomly select carcasses for inspection by their U.S. counterparts when the meat reaches the border.</p>
<p>Previously, processing plants picked the carcasses to be located at the back of trucks for reinspection by U.S. import inspectors. In response to concerns, the U.S. and Canada set up a task force in 1994 to develop new procedures.</p>
<p>USDA said inspectors from its Food Safety and Inspection Service will also select random samples to reinspect.</p>
<p>USDA said if verification procedures showed the samples selected by Canadian inspectors were not representative of the entire shipment, FSIS would take regulatory action, including the possibility of refusing shipments from a Canadian plant.</p>
<p>FSIS will issue reports on the new procedures in three months and in six months.</p>
