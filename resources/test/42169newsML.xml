<p>Australian gold miner Devex Ltd said on Monday its objective is to increase its gold resources to more than one million ounces within two years by stepping up exploration.</p>
<p>Devex is working to redevelop the old Gympie Eldorado gold deposit of south-east Queensland, which produced about 100 tonnes of gold before being abandoned in 1927 after 60 years in operation.</p>
<p>In 1995/96, the company increased the underground mine's ore reserves to 127,000 ounces of contained gold from 27,000 ounces formerly, it said.  </p>
<p>The company earlier on Monday reported net profit of A$5.14 million in 1995/1996, up from A$3.81 million in the previous year.</p>
