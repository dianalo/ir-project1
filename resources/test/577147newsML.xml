<p>An exhibit of priceless Romanov jewelry that almost was shipped back to Russia because of official wrangling opened on Sunday to the delight of thousands of Houstonians.</p>
<p>Lines were long at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, where the collection of jewels and art objects that once belonged to the Romanov dynasty that ruled Russia for three centuries were put on display.</p>
<p>The collection sat in a van parked on a street in Washington D.C. for several days last month when U.S. and Russian organisers disagreed over finances and control of the exhibition. Russia threatened to cut short a scheduled year-long U.S. tour and bring the items home.</p>
<p>The dispute was settled partly by increasing the Russians' cut of revenues, and the collection was shipped to Houston, its next scheduled stop after 10 weeks on display in Washington.</p>
<p>Mikhail Gusman of the Russian Organising Committee for the exhibit said everyone was pleased the controversy surrounding the collection had been resolved.</p>
<p>"We are very happy with the result and that everything's done ... we're happy that our exhibition makes Americans and Houstonians happy," he told reporters.</p>
<p>The collection includes more than 200 items, ranging from jewelry to costumes that were amassed by the Romanovs during their 300-year reign over Russia. The dynasty ended with the Communist revolution of 1917.</p>
<p>The U.S. tour was timed to commemorate the U.S. visit 125 years ago of Grand Duke Alexis.</p>
<p>Those who paid the $6 admission charge on Sunday were not disappointed by the sparkling jewels and other objects. "Everything here is gorgeous. It's unreal that anything like that exists," said visitor Karen Barnett.</p>
