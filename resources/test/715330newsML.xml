<p>The federal budget deficit in the fiscal year ending September 30 looks likely to be "measurably" lower than the Clinton administration's $67 billion forecast, a senior administration official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>However, White House Budget Director Franklin Raines shied away from being more specific, saying the administration would have a new forecast in the next few days.</p>
<p>"The last number that's out there was around $67 billion," Raines told Reuters following a speech at a conference here. "It will be measurably better than that."  </p>
<p>Private sector experts have estimated that the budget deficit in the current fiscal year could fall to about $50 billion thanks to surging tax receipts.</p>
<p>Some have even argued that there is no need enact the agreement between Congress and the administration to balance the budget because the deficit will be eliminated regardless.</p>
<p>But Raines disputed that notion, saying that the agreement between the administration and Congress to balance the budget by 2002 reduces deficits by $200 billion over the next five years.</p>
<p>"We do need that," he said. "Without that, deficits will reappear."</p>
<p>In his speech to a conference sponsored by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, Raines attributed the recent stellar performance of the U.S. economy partly to the success the administration has had in cutting the budget deficit.</p>
<p>"We have unleashed investment in the economy by reducing ... the deficit," Raines said.</p>
<p>The administration is also trying to improve public sector management, Raines said. Among other things, he cited moves to streamline the government benefits system and improve customer service.</p>
