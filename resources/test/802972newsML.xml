<p>A Florida judge on Thursday ordered the state's lawyers not to refer to executives, witnesses or lawyers for tobacco companies as members of the "Mafia, Nazis, liars or perjurors."</p>
<p>Palm Beach Circuit Judge Harold Cohen took the action at the end of a contentious hearing of pretrial motions in Florida's $1-billion lawsuit to recover the costs of treating sick smokers.</p>
<p>Opening statements in the trial are expected to begin shortly after Labor Day.</p>
<p>Cohen also ordered Florida lawyers to avoid referring to attorneys for the tobacco companies as "consiglieri," or Mafia counselors, during their questioning of potential jurors or in opening arguments of a trial that Cohen has called the "mother of all RICO (racketeering) cases" in Florida or any state.</p>
<p>"There shall be no reference to any leader of Nazi Germany by anyone," Cohen also ruled.</p>
<p>He now has approved 114 jury candidates during pre-screening for the panel of six jurors and nine alternates. Jury selection will continue for the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Cohen's ruling was issued after R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. attorney Bob Weber pointed out that tobacco officials had been referred to with such terms in other legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Referring to tobacco companies as crime families or similar to cocaine cartels was "totally inappropriate," Weber said.</p>
<p>In the trial, which could last until January, Florida will seek damages associated with the treatment of Medicaid patients with smoking related ailments.</p>
<p>But the state also has made allegations under racketeering statutes used to prosecute organized crime, saying the industry conspired to hide the true dangers of cigarette smoking from the public.</p>
<p>While W. C. Gentry, one of Florida's lawyers, said the state would not make any improper remarks, it would raise the issue of fraud and deceit by tobacco companies during questioning of potential jurors and opening statements.</p>
<p>"This case is about a deceit and fraud ... and we do not expect to be shackled from telling the jury the truth," Gentry said.</p>
