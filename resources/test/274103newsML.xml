<p>*Australian bonds drifted lower during a thin pre-Christmas session with sellers gaining the upper hand after Friday's easier trend in U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>*Moody's upgrade of WA and Victoria has no impact.  </p>
<p>Australian bonds drifted lower during a thin pre-Christmas session with sellers gaining the upper hand after Friday's easier trend in U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>"There's no real reason for us to be down here. It's been a pretty poor performance, but there's nobody out there willing to trade and it's going to be quieter tomorrow," one trader said.</p>
<p>The U.S. market was off on Friday on profit-taking after sharp gains earlier in the week and amid some disappointment of a tighter policy stance eminating from the minutes of the November FOMC meeting.  </p>
<p>With only November new motor registrations due out on Tuesday before the New Year, the local market continues to find itself dependent on moves in U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>But with Japan, another source of direction, closed, the Australian market was very much in holiday mode with only just below 2,000 lots recorded on the 10-year bond futures contract. A 10,000-contract day is usually seen as mediocre.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Moody's Investors Services upgraded the domestic currency ratings of the Victorian state to AA1 from AA2 and Western Australia to AAA from AA1.  </p>
<p>Traders said the upgrading of the two states had largely been discounted and had little impact on the market.</p>
<p>"On a busier day it might have caused some business, but it just wasn't going to happen today.</p>

<p>The thin local activity saw the market underperform the</p>
<p>dollar bloc. However, conversely the Canadian market</p>
<p>outperformed its dollar partners during an illiquid session on</p>
<p>Friday. N.Z. debt was little changed, underpinned by the launch</p>
<p>of a NZ$200 million Eurobond by the World Bank on Friday.</p>
