<p>The European Commission was considering a Scottish request on Friday to impose minimum prices on imports of farmed salmon, Scottish officials said.</p>
<p>Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth made the request after farmed salmon prices fell to their lowest level since minimum import prices were lifted in June.</p>
<p>"The depressed state of the market for farmed salmon is such that I am writing to (Fisheries) Commissioner Bonino to request the immediate reintroduction of minimum import prices," Forsyth said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Scottish Salmon Growers' Association filed a complaint with the Commission in June that Norwegian salmon was being dumped onto the EU market at less than cost price.</p>
<p>But the Commission is unlikely to complete its inquiry until May 1997.</p>
<p>Following complaints from Scottish and Irish salmon farmers late last year, the Commission introduced minimum import prices but producers said this move did little to restore the market.</p>
