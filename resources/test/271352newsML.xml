<p>Malaysia's Soon Soon Sdn Bhd passed on a tender for 100,000 tonnes of U.S. corn and soybeans after finding the price too high, traders said on Friday.  </p>
<p>"They passed. They felt the price was too high for them," a trader for a U.S. commodity house based in Singapore said.</p>
<p>Dealers said Soon Soon was looking for a combination cargo of corn and soybeans.</p>
<p>This included one Panamax-sized vessel of about 50,000 tonnes of corn and soybeans for January-February delivery. The second Panamax with 50,000 tonnes of corn and soybeans would be for May delivery, the traders said.</p>
<p>The price for the corn quoted by traders ranged between US$142-$145 a tonne C&amp;F. The soybeans were offered at over $300 a tonne C&amp;F.  </p>
<p>"Soon Soon was looking for something at about $140 a tonne for corn and about $295 a tonne for the beans," a dealer for a European commodity house said.</p>
<p>Another dealer said the Malaysians may also be interested in taking a look at the prospect of China exporting in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>"I understand they want to see the Chinese corn first," one trader said.</p>
<p>It was the second time Soon Soon had passed on the tender. No date was set by the company for a new tender, the traders said.  </p>
