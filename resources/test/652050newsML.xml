<headline>Belgian Renault plant closure may be delayed - paper.</headline>

<p>The closure of Renault's Belgian plant in Vilvoorde may be delayed six months, French daily Le Figaro said on Tuesday, citing trade union sources.</p>
<p>The plant is due to close on July 31, with 3,100 job losses.</p>
<p>On Monday, French Economy minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn said he foresaw a positive outcome to the dispute but gave no details.</p>
<p>Aides to Socialist Prime Minister Lionel Jospin have been in contact with Renault over the fast few days and have said Renault should disclose results of the talks, possibly on June 10, when both its board of directors and its shareholders have set meetings.  </p>
<p>But trade union sources said the delay would not save the plant and that it would ultimately close down.</p>
<p>"The plant is already dead in people's minds," one union source said.</p>
<p>Renault could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Renault's announcement in February that it would close the plant sparked demonstrations but Jospin pledged during France's general election campaign he would ask Renault to study alternatives to allow the plant to remain open the issue if he came to power.</p>
<p>Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, who lives in Vilvoorde, met with Jospin on Saturday and said Jospin would disclose his stance on Renault this week. The French state is a minority shareholder in Renault.</p>
<p>Renault-Volvoorde workers have halted work ahead of the June 10 meetings and will join today their French counterparts in demonstrations in Paris.</p>
