<p>The energy sector, including oil gas and coal, will remain a key contributor to the Indonesian economy for the foreseeable future, a review by British Petroleum Co PLC said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Clearly as Indonesia's economy successfully grows, the relative importance of the energy economy to national income reduces, but the energy sector as a whole will remain a key contributor to the Indonesian economy for the foreseeable future," said Peter Godfrey, BP Indonesia business development manager.</p>
<p>Godfrey was presenting BP's annual statistical review of world energy to analysts and journalists.</p>
<p>He said total world primary energy consumption outside the former Soviet Union grew 2.9 percent in 1995. The world's fastest growing energy markets were the Philippines, Malaysia, Thailand, Turkey and South Africa, he added.</p>
<p>Malaysia was also the fastest growing oil market in the world last year at 15.5 percent, consuming 430,000 bpd.</p>
<p>"Indonesian oil consumption grew by only 4.5 percent, having actually fallen in 1994 as expensive fuel oil continues to be successfully substituted by domestic gas and oil," Godfrey said.</p>
<p>He said that over the past 20 years, the world had added 1.77 barrels of new oil to reserves for every barrel consumed. Total proved reserves at end 1995 stood at just over 1.0 trillion barrels, with 1995 production of 67.5 million bpd and consumption of 67.9 million bpd.</p>
<p>Indonesia -- Asia's only OPEC member -- went against the trend, however, with proved reserves falling by the end of last year to 5.2 billion barrels from 14 billion in 1985, while domestic consumption rose last year to 810,000 bpd from 460,000 a decade earlier.</p>
<p>"Indonesia has basically followed fairly stable trends with a slowly reducing production and faster rising consumption pattern, thereby giving concerns about becoming net importer status.</p>
<p>"This will continue to encourage the move away from oil into other, more readily available resources, in particular gas and coal," he said.</p>
<p>Godfrey said the Indonesian gas market "continues to show healthy signs of growth". Domestic consumption rose by nearly 10 percent in 1995, although production grew by only one percent.</p>
<p>This underlined the importance of bringing new developments into play.</p>
<p>BP said Indonesia had proved natural gas reserves at end 1995 of 68.9 trillion cubic feet, or 2.0 trillion cubic metres. Production was 58.5 billion cubic metres, or 2.06 trillion cubic feet, last year.</p>
<p>Godfrey said Liquefied Natural as (LNG) also played a vital role as an export earner for Indonesia.</p>
<p>He said domestic gas could be "an engine for economic growth for the future". But he added this required a government commitment for "the development of open infrastructure, the reduction in costs and the use of modern cost-effective technology".</p>
<p>Godfrey noted that Indonesia was unique in Asia with large reserves of gas and coal, both of which were exported.</p>
<p>Indonesia produced 39.1 million tonnes of hard coal in 1995, and had a reserve to production of about 900 years, he said.</p>
<p>BP defined proved reserves as "those quantities which geological and engineering information indicates with reasonable certainty can be recovered in the future from known reservoirs under exisiting economic and operating conditions".</p>
