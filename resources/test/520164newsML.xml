<p>Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov had an operation to remove a gallstone on Friday, his surgeon said.</p>
<p>"We hope that in two or three weeks he will be able to return to work," Professor Vitaly Bashilov, who conducted the operation at the elite central Clinical Hospital, told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>"It was a rather complicated operation and the patient's condition was not simple but everything will be alright."</p>
<p>Primakov, 66, missed a scheduled meeting with Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama earlier on Friday because he had been taken to hospital with what a Foreign Ministry spokesman described as a "rather unexpected" bout of illness.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear whether his sudden illness would affect the tough talks between Moscow and NATO over the Western defence alliance's plans to expand eastwards. The Russian minister has played an important role in the talks.</p>
<p>A Foreign Ministry official told Interfax news agency a next round of talks between Primakov and NATO Secretary General Javier Solana, planned for the first half of May, had not been cancelled.</p>
