<p>Albania's government issued a desperate call on Thursday for foreign military intervention to restore order in the anarchic Balkan state and the United States and Europe mustered to evacuate their nationals.</p>
<p>U.S. warships in the Adriatic were put on standby for a possible evacuation of Americans from Albania. Italy began plucking hundreds of evacuees to safety and Britain and other European nations urgently sought ways to do likewise.</p>
<p>"This is a very dangerous situation. Ethnic tensions in the Balkans have long been a real problem for the entire world," White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.</p>
<p>In the clearest sign yet that President Sali Berisha and the newly-formed coalition government were no longer in control after weeks of unrest, all Albanian political parties urged NATO's European members to use their military power to end the turmoil.</p>
<p>The interim government headed by Socialist Prime Minister Bashkim Fino issued the call for outside help as arms seizures and shooting spread to the capital Tirana. Most of the country south of the city was in the hands of rebels.</p>
<p>All political forces in Albania agreed that outside military assistance was needed "to restore the constitutional order and to preserve the country's integrity", the government said in its appeal sent to the Western European Union (WEU).</p>
<p>The WEU, considered the future defence arm of the European Union, includes Britain, France, Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>The EU said it was seriously considering the request.</p>
<p>"As far as I am concerned all options are open and the request deserves serious consideration," said Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van Mierlo, whose country currently holds the EU presidency.</p>
<p>U.S. warships were on standby off the Albanian coast in case Washington ordered in marines to evacuate some 2,000 Americans left in Albania.</p>
<p>"We have pre-positioned equipment and a contingent of marines should there be a need for a mission." said a spokesman for the U.S. European Command in Stuttgart, which oversees American military operations in Europe.</p>
<p>A Pentagon official said: "We're watching and we're planning. We're still in the watch-and-wait mode."</p>
<p>Italy went ahead with an evacuation of 400 foreign nationals, 330 of them Italians. It ferried the evacuees from two air fields near the Albanian port of Durres to Italian navy ships in the Adriatic.</p>
<p>Britain was preparing to evacuate 120 British, Commonwealth and some European Union nationals from Albania by sea on a British naval vessel, said a British embassy spokesman in Tirana.</p>
<p>"In view of the further deterioration of the situation in Albania...we are now arranging for evacuation as soon as possible," the Foreign Office in London said in a statement.</p>
<p>Austria said its embassy in Tirana was preparing an evacuation of its nationals. Hungary and Bulgaria were reported to be doing the same.</p>
<p>Foreign governments this week advised thousands of their citizens living and working in Albania to leave the country as soon as possible as signs grew that the country was plunging deeper into anarchy.</p>
<p>A declaration of a state of emergency by the Albanian parliament nearly two weeks ago, and warnings that security forces would shoot to kill, did nothing to halt an insurrection which began in the Adriatic port of Vlore.</p>
<p>Townsfolk throughout the south, who had staged protests over the collapse of pyramid investment schemes, raided army and police arms depots as regular police and soldiers either defected to their side or fled.</p>
<p>The arms seizures were accompanied by widespread looting and burning of buildings by men and youths shooting wildly. Even local town committees have been unable to control them.</p>
<p>Signs of a spreading insurgency were apparent overnight when doctors in the northern city of Shkoder said five people were killed and 50 were wounded as two arms depots were looted.</p>
<p>The closure of Tirana airport after the looting of a nearby military base meant an Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission to Albania was delayed.</p>
<p>The 10-member delegation, headed by former Austrian chancellor Franz Vranitzky, was scheduled to fly from Vienna early on Friday.</p>
<p>They planned to travel on an Italian military plane to Bari where helicopters would ferry them either to the Albanian mainland or to an Italian ship off the coast.</p>
<p>Vranitzky hoped to hold talks with political party leaders and representatives of rebels in control in the south.</p>
<p>At the United Nations, Italy and Albania asked the U.N. Security Council to meet urgently on the Balkan state's slide into anarchy.</p>
<p>An Italian spokesman said a statement from the 15-member council might help calm the situation.</p>
