<p>Hard red winter wheat in Nebraska came through the winter in better condition than last year but moisture is needed to aid development, according to the state's agricultural statistics service.</p>
<p>The crop as of Sunday, was rated three percent excellent, 53 percent good, 38 percent fair and six percent poor.</p>
<p>"Moisture supplies in the southwest and parts of the Panhandle were short. Additional moisture is also needed to aid germination of spring planted crops," the report said.</p>
<p>Topsoil moisture was rated six percent very short, 34 percent short, 55 percent adequate and five percent surplus.</p>
<p>Oats seeding was 18 percent complete, ahead of last year's 10 percent and a five-year average of 14 percent.</p>
<p>"Seeding was least advanced in the northeast part of the state due to wet field conditions," the report said, noting one percent of the crop had emerged.</p>
<p>Pasture and range conditions were rated three percent poor, 28 percent fair, 67 percent good and two percent excellent.</p>
