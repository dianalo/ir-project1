<p>Leading Hungarian stocks were heading downwards on Thursday, trimmed by profit-taking and position closings on the futures market, traders said.</p>
<p>"We see profit-taking, domestic clients are selling," said Tamas Revesz of Wintrust.</p>
<p>The BUX index, which set three successive closing highs, traded at 6,683.28 points, down 96.31 points or 1.42 percent at 1033 GMT.</p>
<p>Another trader said prices were also pushed lower by position closings on the futures market as investors were buying index contracts and selling stocks on the spot market.</p>
<p>"(The rally) has run out of steam, and some investors are closing arbitrage positions," said Attila Berecz of Raiffeisen Securities, adding that investors were buying index futures and selling stocks.</p>
<p>Position closings hit chemicals BorsodChem , meat processor Pick , plastics group Pannonplast and gas distributor Primagaz , he said.</p>
<p>However, traders added that news that privatisation agency APV Rt declared the selloff tender in meat processor Ringa unsuccessful, also weighed on Pick's price which was trading more than seven percent weaker at 1027 GMT.</p>
<p>Berecz added, that more liquid stocks like oil company MOL or chemicals TVK whose prices could not be moved substantially by small amounts of traded stocks, were also moving down.</p>
<p>"Maybe prices recover slightly by the end of the day but I think this correction will last this week," Berecz added.</p>
