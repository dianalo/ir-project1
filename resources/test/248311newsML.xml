<p>Revco D.S. Inc said Wednesday it would be interested in acquiring all or some of the 161 North and South Carolina drug stores that J.C. Penney Co Inc is expected to divest.</p>
<p>"We would be interested in purchasing those stores," spokesman Thomas Dingledy said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission said this week that Plano, Texas-based department store giant Penney will divest the stores due to its pending acquisition of drug chain Eckerd Co and planned purchase of some Rite Aid Corp drug stores.  </p>
<p>Penney, through its Pittsburgh-based Thrift Drug unit, owns 1,089 drug stores in 17 states. Last month Penney said it would pay $3.3 billion to acquire Largo, Fla.-based Eckerd which has 1,724 drug stores in 13 states.</p>
<p>Penney also plans to buy 190 stores in the Carolinas from Camp Hill, Pa.-based Rite Aid, which has more than 2,700 stores in 21 eastern states.</p>
<p>The FTC said Penney agreed to sell 34 Thrift Drug stores in the Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham areas and to sell all but 63 of the Rite Aids. The FTC said the sale would resolve  concerns about concentration of ownership in the area which it said could tend to drive up prescription prices.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, federal regulatory concerns derailed a friendly $1.8 billion merger between Rite Aid and Revco. Since then, 2,202-store Revco completed a tender offer for Alabama-based Big B Inc, which has 402 drug stores and home health care centers. Dingledy said Revco expects to complete the $380 million deal by Dec. 31.</p>
<p>Revco has 305 stores in North Carolina and 183 in South Carolina, Dingledy said.</p>
