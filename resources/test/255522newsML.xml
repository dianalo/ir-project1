<p>Indian wheat prices softened on news of imports and are expected to fall sharply after wheat shipments start arriving in January, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said wheat prices in northern Indian markets fell by nearly 1,500 rupees per tonne this week on reports that the government would go for large scale imports to check prices.</p>
<p>Average quality semi-hard wheat was quoted on Friday at around 6,000-6,250 rupees per tonne.</p>
<p>Traders said the government's announcement late on Thursday that it would import two million tonnes of wheat, also contributed to the fall.</p>
<p>In the Bombay markets, prices fell by nearly 1,000 rupees per tonne, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>India decided to import the two million tonnes of wheat in 1996/97 (April-March) to augment domestic supplies and check rising prices.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said wheat prices would fall further when imported wheat reached the local markets.</p>
<p>"It has not brought down wheat prices immediately," Mulraj Tanna, a leading foodgrains exporter, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"But by the time imported wheat starts coming in January, it will bring the prices down and people will have to bring out their hoarded stocks," Tanna said.</p>
<p>Traders had said earlier that the news of wheat imports would push down prices by nearly 20-25 percent.</p>
<p>Prem Garg, a leading Delhi foodgrains exporter, told Reuters on Thursday that wheat in the domestic markets was priced at around 6,700 rupees per tonne but would soon fall below the 6,000-rupee mark. --New Delhi newsroom +91-11-301 2024</p>
