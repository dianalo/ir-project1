<p>The Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily blocked the scheduled execution of Virginia death-row inmate Joseph O'Dell, who claims that new DNA evidence casts doubt on his murder conviction.</p>
<p>The high court granted a stay of execution for O'Dell, whose case has been championed by death-penalty opponents and has brought a plea for clemency by Pope John Paul II, until it acts on his appeal challenging his conviction and sentence.  </p>
<p>O'Dell, who was convicted in 1986 of murdering and raping a 44-year-old woman, had been scheduled to die by lethal injection on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>It was not known when the Supreme Court would decide his appeal, but the earliest it could happen would be in January, when the justices reconvene.</p>
<p>Death penalty opponents around the world have pleaded his case, arguing that new DNA evidence shows that blood stains found on his shirt do not match those of the victim.</p>
<p>In appealing to the Supreme Court, his lawyers said the DNA evidence raises serious questions. "It is highly unlikely that any jury would have convicted O'Dell had it known what the DNA evidence shows," they said. "O'Dell was wrongly convicted of committing this crime" and they urged the high court to correct "this important error."</p>
