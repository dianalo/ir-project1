<p>Ushers of Trowbridge Group Plc, a regional brewer, said on Wednesday it plans to float on London Stock Exchange by means of a placing.</p>
<p>The proceeds from the placing, sponsored by Hambros Bank with Panmure Gordon as broker, will be used to reduce borrowing and fund expansion.</p>
<p>The group also said it had appointed Tom Vyner, deputy chairman of J. Sainsbury Plc, as non-executive chairman.</p>
<p>Publishing the pathfinder prospectus today, with the final prospectus scheduled for early March, chief executive Roger North expressed optimism about the group's future.</p>
<p>"Ushers' position as a vertically integrated regional brewer with an established specialist contract brewing activity offers us a wide range of opportunities for expansion," North said.</p>
<p>"The flotation will help us to take full advantage of these opportunities as they arise and we are optimistic about Ushers' prospects for continued growth."</p>
