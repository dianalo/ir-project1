<p>The Polish government is likely to decide next week on whether to restore the 20 percent customs duty on grains ahead of schedule, government spokeswoman Aleksandra Jakubowska said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz has asked that the situation on the grains market and the impact of reintroducing the duty be thoroughly examined by the end of this week," Jakubowska told a news briefing after a cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>The grain imports duty, designed to protect domestic farmers, was suspended last year until June 30, 1997 to cap fast growing food prices.</p>
<p>But Agriculture Minister Roman Jagielinski of the Polish Peasant Party (PSL) says that duty-free grains imports should now end because the market has stabilised after substantial imports and good grains output prospects.</p>
