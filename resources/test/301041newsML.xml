<p>Serbian opposition leaders, buoyed as the government drifts toward conceding losses in disputed local elections, said on Saturday they wanted not just "piecemeal" concessions but sweeping democratisation.</p>
<p>President Slobodan Milosevic's Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) government appeared to yield to mass street protests against its annulment of the outcome of the municipal polls in November by agreeing that "genuine and final" results must be honoured.</p>
<p>But the decision had yet to be translated into action by a divided ruling party. Sceptical opposition activists cautioned that anything less than a broad liberalisation of Serbia's authoritarian system would not suffice.</p>
<p>"We are receiving reports about piecemeal restoration of our election victory. But we will not accept that. Our objective is complete reform of this country," said Zoran Djindjic, co-leader of the Zajedno (Together) coalition.</p>
<p>"Our first and fundamental demand is the deblocking of the (state-dominated) media, without which there can be no future for this country," Djindjic told thousands massed in Belgrade.</p>
<p>"The second demand is an open democratic debate on our future -- all educated people must have their say on what reforms we want, what will happen to the economy, agriculture, army, police, and all the sacrifice that will be needed if we want a future for ourselves," he said.</p>
<p>"Our mass protests here are an anti-communist referendum of sorts. You will all be able to find a place for yourselves in our reform programme, one that will serve the people and not the ruling class."</p>
<p>Western governments have also demanded broader democratic change in Serbia in exchange for unblocking credits and investment urgently sought by Milosevic to rebuild an economy wrecked by corruption and international sanctions.</p>
<p>Opposition takeovers in municipalities would break the SPS stranglehold on the mainstream media and would loosen state controls on the judiciary as well.</p>
<p>Djindjic said Zajedno, which may be offered posts in the Serbian government according to senior political sources, would reject "compromises that would prolong the life of this corrupt regime - there can be no compromises in that".</p>
<p>Vuk Draskovic, another Zajedno leader, flatly rejected any alliance with the SPS. He said Zajedno would accept dialogue with Serbian authorities only about state media control and creating conditions for fair elections.</p>
<p>"Milosevic can choose," he told the throng. "He can either agree to lift the blockade of state television, accept all our demands, and go in peace, or he will need 900,000 policemen next week to calm the people's rage."</p>
<p>Djindjic promised that half a million demonstrators, Zajedno's biggest turnout to date, would paralyse Belgrade on Monday, the Serbian Orthodox New Year's Eve.</p>
<p>Political sources said the embattled SPS leadership was anxious to head off such a huge outpouring of anti-government fervour and had decided to concede Zajedno's election success on Saturday as a result.</p>
<p>The amorphous opposition movement groups pro-Western democrats, nationalists, royalists, disgruntled unemployed, irreverent university students and maverick crusaders.</p>
<p>Despite its disparate elements, the coalition is formally committed to democratic and free-market reforms, feeding off discontent with state mismanagement of an economy that crumbled under U.N. sanctions in 1992-96.</p>
<p>But some analysts have doubts about the credentials of some Zajedno leaders including Djindjic who not long ago backed ultra-nationalist Serbs at war in Bosnia and Croatia, sponsored at the time by Milosevic.</p>
<p>Draskovic, a charismatic, bearded man with a nationalist past, is given to wild oratory about alleged terrorists ruling Serbia and the need to purge "enemies" of the nation.</p>
<p>Croatia, which opened diplomatic relations with Serbia last year after years of hostility following its 1991 war for independence from Serbian-led Yugoslavia, claims that Zajedno nationalists would threaten peace if they gained power.</p>
