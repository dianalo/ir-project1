<p>The New Zealand Commerce Commission said on Wednesday it found no evidence that Ansett New Zealand and Air New Zealand had colluded over recent domestic fare increases.  </p>
<p>The two airlines hiked domestic fares by three percent on December 15 and international airlines raised their fares by the same amount that day.</p>
<p>The International Air Transport Association (IATA) had previously recommended a three percent fare hike because of rising fuel prices.</p>
<p>The commission investigated to see if there was a breach of the Commerce Act but found none.</p>
<p>Chairman Alan Bollard warned that if the commission found evidence of price fixing it would act.  </p>
<p>"Any form of formal or informal communication among competitors about prices can breach the Act," he said.</p>
<p>"In some cases a firm giving a rival prior warning of a pricing announcement could be enough to be price fixing."</p>
<p>The commission could not investigate the raising of international fares because the rise was authorised by the Transport Ministry following an IATA recommendation.</p>
