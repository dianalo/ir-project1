<p>The Irish Republican Army said on Tuesday it had abandoned a land mine in the grounds of a hotel on the outskirts of Belfast, security sources said.</p>
<p>They said a telephone caller using an IRA identity-codeword contacted a local media outlet to say that the device was in a van in the grounds of Belfast Castle, a 19th century former mansion set in extensive parkland.</p>
<p>The caller said the device had been abandoned there because of a high level of security force activity in the district.</p>
<p>British army bomb disposal experts have been called to the castle to examine a suspect vehicle and people attending a function at the castle have been evacuated, police said.</p>
<p>The security sources said that they did not know whether the late night New Year's Eve warning was genuine or a device to lure them into an attack.</p>
<p>They said that the use of the term "abandon" could mean that guerrilla plans of an attack marking the start of the New Year had been thwarted.</p>
<p>Security has been stepped up across Northern Ireland and in mainland Britain since the IRA abandoned a ceasefire last February in a 27-year campaign to end British rule.</p>
<p>The IRA set off a wave of bombs in British cities and killed a soldier at British army headquarters south of Belfast last October.</p>
<p>Tension has heightened in recent weeks with bomb attacks aimed at republicans which security sources believe were reprisals by pro-British Loyalist extremists who have been operating a truce for the last two years.</p>
