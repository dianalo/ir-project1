<p>Digital Equipment Corp. Tuesday claimed Intel Corp., the world's largest computer chip maker, illegally used its technology to make the Pentium microprocessor family.</p>
<p>In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Worcester, Mass., late Monday, Digital claimed that Intel, the Santa Clara, Calif-based company that supplies between 80 and 85 percent of the chips used in the world's personal computers, infringed on 10 Digital patents in all versions of its Pentium, Pentium Pro and Pentium II chips.</p>
<p>News of the suit sent Intel stock down sharply. Intel ended at $152.375 a share, down $6.75, on Nasdaq, while Digital closed at $35.25 a share, up $2.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Digital, based in Maynard, Mass., is seeking to force Intel to stop using its technology and wants triple monetary damages, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Digital Chief Executive Officer Robert Palmer declined to specify an amount in a conference call with reporters except to say "the numbers involved are quite huge."</p>
<p>Intel reported revenues of $21.8 billion in 1996 and profits of $5.2 billion. For the first quarter of this year, profits were almost $2 billion on $6.4 billion in sales.</p>
<p>"We were quite surprised by it (the lawsuit)," said Intel spokesman Howard High, "Especially with the longstanding relationship that we have. They're a customer of ours."</p>
<p>Indeed, Palmer said he wanted to be absolutely certain of his company's claims before filing a suit against Intel, "a longtime Digital customer, supplier and competitor."</p>
<p>The suit involves patents that date between 1988 and 1996. Intel introduced the first version of the Pentium chip in 1993, two years after it broke off talks with Digital about a possible partnership.</p>
<p>Palmer said he first became suspicious when he saw an Aug. 26, 1996, Wall Street Journal article in which two of the company's top executives "talked openly about the company's practice of copying computer systems architectures and their microprocessors."</p>
<p>Among other things, Palmer said, the article reported "that Intel has done little original research in microprocessor architecture design. Now I don't mind competing against Intel, but I would rather not compete against our own technology."</p>
<p>Analysts reactions were mixed.</p>
<p>"There is an old saying that when things are going wrong internally the best thing to do is invent an outside enemy," said Chicago Corp. analyst David Wu. "There are a number of internal problems at Digital."</p>
<p>Digital saw its sales slump to $3.3 billion from $3.6 billion in the third quarter, which ended March 30.</p>
<p>S&amp;P Equity group analyst Megan Graham-Hackett said the suit "brought Digital some good publicity for its technology. It has very good technology, but it has not be able to market that technology very well."</p>
