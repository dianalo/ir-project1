<p>When President Bill Clinton takes the world stage at the Denver economic summit next week he would prefer a break from various scandals, but quite often they turn up to haunt him.</p>
<p>He was in Mexico last month on a state visit when a report surfaced back home that the independent counsel investigating the Clintons' Whitewater financial investment, Kenneth Starr, found that Clinton's wife Hillary appeared to have changed her testimony on the matter over time.</p>
<p>Standing in the hot sun at a news conference with Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo, Clinton wilted a bit when a question came up about Starr's report and he angrily responded to a reporter.</p>
<p>Then just a few weeks ago Clinton was on a state visit to the Netherlands when news came that the Supreme Court's nine justices had ruled unanimously that a sexual harassment suit by Paula Jones against Clinton could go forward while he was in office.</p>
<p>Jones is the former Arkansas state employee who claims Clinton, while governor of the state, made unwanted sexual advances to her in a Little Rock hotel in 1991.</p>
<p>The ruling cast a pall over his trip to Europe. At a news conference with European Union leaders, American reporters who wanted to ask for Clinton's reaction to the case were never called on, so they later reached him while he was shaking hands on a street corner at the Hague.</p>
<p>Presidential expert Rich Forshee of Georgetown University said it is a typical response for presidents to use "international occasions as a means to look presidential, as a means to rise above any personal difficulties they might be having."</p>
<p>He said foreign policy offered Clinton a chance to work without the constraints of the Republican-led Congress.</p>
<p>"In terms of thinking about his place in history and in terms of looking at the practical political situation of what he can do in his second term, foreign policy has started to occupy some more of his attention," Forshee said.</p>
<p>As Clinton prepares to meet leaders of the world's seven largest industrial nations (Japan, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, Canada and the United States) plus Russia, at Denver's summit, the White House is waiting on the Supreme Court to rule on a Whitewater-related matter.</p>
<p>Clinton has appealed to the high court against a lower court ruling that the White House turn over notes to Starr of conversations its lawyers had with Mrs Clinton regarding her 1996 grand jury appearance and in the aftermath of the 1993 suicide of White House deputy counsel Vincent Foster.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court was expected to decide by the end of June whether it will hear the White House appeal. If it denies the appeal, the notes would have to be surrendered.</p>
<p>Still hanging around Clinton's neck as well is the controversy over Democratic campaign financing irregularities from Clinton's re-election campaign last year.</p>
<p>A team of Justice Department investigators is probing the way money was raised, including whether China tried to route money to the Democrats. Senate hearings on the fund-raising flap could make Washington's hot summer even warmer for the president.</p>
<p>Outwardly, Clinton likes to maintain a sunny attitude toward the various troubles facing him and generally lets his lawyers respond for him.</p>
<p>A case in point came earlier this month when his private lawyer, David Kendall, accused Starr of violating grand jury secrecy rules with a public relations blitz aimed at the Clintons.</p>
