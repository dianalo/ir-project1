<p>Pakistan's debt service ratio declined to 52.2 percent of export earnings in fiscal 1995/96 (July-June) from 55.7 percent in 1994/95, the State (central) Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Thursday.</p>
<p>It said the ratio to foreign exchange earnings also fell to 33.9 percent from 34.9 percent because of static debt service payments and a modest rise in exports and forex earnings.</p>
<p>Pakistan's total external debt was an estimated $28.6 billion at the end of 1995/96, up from $27.07 billion a year earlier, the SBP said in its annual report.</p>
<p>It said foreign debt had expanded sharply and foreign reserves had fallen because of the need to finance Pakistan's large current account deficit for several years.</p>
<p>Medium and short-term debt grew almost three times as fast as long-term debt in 1995/96 and over the past five years.</p>
<p>The bank said the ratio of external debt to gross domestic product fell to 44.1 percent in 1995/96 from 44.8 percent in 1994/95, because nominal GDP growth was higher, and growth in external debt smaller, than in the preceding year.</p>
<p>It said long-term debt amounted to $23.07 billion, or 80.7 percent of the total, while short- and medium-term debt was $5.53 billion, or 19.3 percent of the total.</p>
<p>Debt service payments rose 0.3 percent to $4.336 billion in 1995/96, against a 19.7 percent increase in 1994/95, reflecting lower repayments of principal, especially of short-term loans of less than one year, to commercial banks.</p>
<p>Repayments of principal, which represented 75.1 percent of total debt service payments, fell 1.4 percent to $3.257 billion in 1995/96, against a 21.4 percent increase in 1994/95.</p>
<p>Interest payments, rising 5.8 percent to an estimated $1.079 billion, constituted 24.9 percent of total external debt service payments, the central bank report said.</p>
