<p>The prospect of take-off and landing slots being traded between airlines at British airports lifted British Airways (BA) shares again on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>BZW was the latest brokerage house to stir buying interest after reports in Friday's Financial Times newspaper that the European Commission was expected to recommend legislation by the end of the year to change present slot rules.</p>
<p>Shares in BA hit an all-time high of 617p in early trading before drifting back to 603p, up 8-1/2p on the day and over seven percent since the initial Financial Times report.  </p>
<p>BZW said the trading of slots would increase the likelihood of BA's tie-up with American Airlines and improve the company's balance sheet.</p>
<p>At the lower end of its estimates, the value of BA's Heathrow slots alone would amount to around three billion stg, doubling the net asset value to around 550p per share and halving gearing to 75 percent.</p>
<p>The value of the slots may be capitalised or alternatively sold and leased back should BA need the liquidity, it suggested.</p>
<p>The increased likelihood and attraction of the American deal and the possible balance sheet benefits imply considerable scope for upside in the share price, said BZW in comments published today.</p>
