<p>Phelps Dodge Corp said Friday its 13 percent rise in consolidated second quarter earnings from a year ago was led by record-matching or near-record matching performances by its two operating subsidiaries.</p>
<p>The growth was also fueled by reduced shares outstanding resulting from the company's continuing share buy-back program, it said.  </p>
<p>The company said second quarter sales at its Phelps Dodge Mining Co unit were $603.8 million versus $529.3 million a year ago, despite a $0.02 cent drop in the average spot price per pound of copper cathode on the New York Commodity Exhange. The unit produced a record-matching 399 million pounds of copper during the quarter.</p>
<p>The company's Phelps Dodge Industries unit had sales of $461.2 million versus $428.4 a year ago, an increase driven by higher volumes in the wire and cable business, the company said.  </p>
<p>Depsite the higher sales, the industries unit suffered a slight drop in operating income because of a seven-week strike at its London, Ont., wheel and rim plant, it said.</p>
<p>During the quarter, the company said it repurchased 2.5 million shares of its stock at a cost of $197.3 million. At quarter end, the company had shares outstanding of 61.1 million, a 14 percent reduction since the beginning of 1995, and a six percent reduction since this year.</p>
<p>"We believe our stock is a good value at current market prices and plant to continue our aggressive share purchase program," company chairman, president and chief executive officer Douglas Yearley said in a press release.</p>
<p>The share buy-back program may result in a slight increase in the company's debt-to-total-capitization ratio, Yearley said, "but only within reasonably conservative limits."</p>
