<p>Volatilities of over-the-counter gold options soared over the past few days, with one-month levels reaching 10 percent as spot gold dived, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Last Friday vols hammered up during the last few hours of Comex trading and yesterday things were also very volatile in early Europe, vols were exploding,"one dealer in Europe said.</p>
<p>Implied volatilities for one-month options were bid as high as 10 percent on Monday, up from 6.1 percent at the end of last year, he said.</p>
<p>But on Tuesday, one-month volatilities pulled back to about 8.75 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Even though there's still some activity, it doesn't warrant those high rates," a dealer in London said.</p>
<p>Another said despite any short-term easing, volatilities should generally hold their firmer stance in coming weeks.</p>
<p>For some dealers, most of the activity in recent days was in strikes close to the money, with trading seen in both puts and calls. One dealer said the delta ranged from 33 percent to 40 percent, with the widest strikes about $1.50 from spot levels.</p>
<p>The interest has been focused on short-term dates, from one to three months, they added.</p>
<p>Another dealer, however, said he had seen business in strikes from $350 to $370.</p>
<p>"But I think people have very little on their books below $350 and not much below $360. Today we did see some interest in $350s," he said.</p>
<p>Volatilities in longer dates also were firmer, but not to the same extent as one month material.</p>
<p>Three months implied volatilties were bid at 7.5 to 8.25 percent, six months at 7.3 to 7.5 percent and one-year at 7.0 to 7.2 percent.</p>
