<p>The ecu dropped against the drachma on market expectations of ecu sales for drachmas and forex swaps, while interbank depos were trading slightly lower late on Monday, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The ecu fell against the drachma. The market is expecting ecu sales because of forecasts of a declining ecu. Trade was not heavy on Monday," a state-bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Deposits and forex swaps were trading slightly lower, dealers said.</p>
<p>"After news of T-bill interest rate cuts came out, six-month, nine-month and 12-month depos decreased 10 basis points and short-term depos were five points down," a dealer said.</p>
<p>The Greek finance ministry cut gross interest rates on three-, six- and 12-month T-bills by 40 basis points to 9.4, 9.7 and 10.5 percent respectively, effective February 24.</p>
<p>The ministry will also cut the gross interest rate on its two-year zero-coupon bond by 20 basis points to 10.10 effective February 28.</p>
<p>The central bank kept its intervention rate in overnight money unchanged at 11.90 percent.</p>
<p>Bonds had a slow day with prices holding, a bond dealer said.</p>
<p>The mark was quoted at 156.65/70 from Monday's 156.660 fix,</p>
