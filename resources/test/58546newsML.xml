<p>CME live cattle futures ended mostly lower with concern over increasing fed cattle supplies weighing on back months, traders said. Feeder cattle also ended lower, following deferred live cattle.</p>
<p>However, October live cattle held firm on recent advances in cash cattle prices which marked thed highest levels since March, 1995. Boxed beef prices also are at highest levels since November.</p>
<p>But concern that fed cattle supplies will be much larger going into 1997 due to stepped up placements weighed heavily on back months, traders said. Commercial hedging was also cited in December and February.</p>
<p>Early projections on Friday's report for on-feed cattle supplies as of September 1 in the seven key states ranged from from 88.2 to 92 percent of a year ago, with the number of cattle placed in feedlots seen at 106.6 to 119 percent and marketings at 92 to 98 percent of a year ago.</p>
<p>Cargill Investor Services and RBH notably bought October while RBH, Rand Financials, Iowa Grain, Lind-Waldock and E.D.&amp;F. Man sold December and Dean Witter sold February, pit sources said.  </p>
<p>In live cattle options, volatility was steady to weak. Selling of the premium in back months was noted, especially April 66 puts and 70 calls, pit sources added.</p>
<p>Feeder cattle were pressured early by higher grain futures and later by the setback in deferred live cattle futures. The upward reversal in corn futures sparked initial liquidation and expectations of declining fed cattle prices next year weighed on sentiment later, traders said.</p>
<p>RBH, Shatkin and ADM sold October while Iowa Grain and LIT bought early, traders said, while ADM also spread long January/short September.</p>
<p>The latest CME Feeder Cattle Index was up $0.15 at $64.08 per cwt, highest level since December 27, 1995.</p>
<p>Live cattle closed 0.050 cent higher to 0.525 lower with only October up at 73.000 cents per lb. Feeder cattle ended 0.200 to 0.475 lower with October off most at 64.925 cents a lb.</p>
