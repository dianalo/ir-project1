<headline>LIFFE coffee ends off peaks, still within range.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-02</dateline>

<p>LIFFE robusta coffee futures stepped back from their peaks after earlier trade and speculative buying encountered origin sales but prices still closed firmer.</p>
<p>Price movements were kept in a $20-$30 band after a lacklustre session with the market still battling to steer away from its current $1,610-$1,675 range.</p>
<p>Even a renewed ascent in New York in early trading and news of a possible national port workers strike in Brazil failed to inspire trading.</p>
<p>By the finish, May was just $27 firmer at $1,641 a tonne after ranging between $1,668 and $1,640.</p>
<p>Traders said the contract seemed to be consolidating after falling to a low of $1,515 last week. But they said a move further towards the $1,700 region could be an uphill task for now.</p>
<p>Volume leader July was $38 higher at $1,660. The second-position attracted some switch trades with May and forward September.</p>
<p>Overall turnover reached 4,579 lots.</p>
<p>New York's May arabica futures hit a session high of $2.00 on Wednesday on further speculative buying.</p>
<p>While the possible Brazilian strike would have no or little immediate impact on the market, players are jittery in case the supply pipelines are affected.</p>
<p>The president of Brazil's Stevedores Federation said stevedores would definitely hold a national strike from 0700 local/1000 GMT on April 4 over a labour dispute.</p>
<p>The latest International Coffee Organization (ICO) export data, as expected, showed that coffee exports continued to be front-loaded as Central and South American producers took advantage of the recent price rally to unload their holdings.</p>
<p>As such, growers would have little coffee left to sell before the next crop harvest later this year.</p>
<p>The ICO said its exporting members' exports rose to 7.41 million 60-kg bags in February from 6.87 million in January and 6.66 million in February 1996.</p>
<p>In the first five months of the current 1996/97 coffee year to February total exports were up at 34.26 million from 30.30 million in the same 1995/96 period.</p>
