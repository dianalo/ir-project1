<p>Singapore property index plunged 2.36 percent or 15.87 points to a new year low of 657.25 in late Monday trade on rumours of further government curbs in the property market.  </p>
<p>At 0915 GMT, the index was trading at 657.11, down 16.01 points or 2.38 percent.</p>
<p>Property heavyweight City Developments Ltd fell S$0.70 to S$12.00 with over half a million shares traded.</p>
<p>"The market is down on persistent rumours of more property curbs," said Soong Tuck Hin, head of research at GK Goh Research.</p>
<p>Soong said if true, the measures were likely to be a fine tuning of the government's April 12 curbs designed to cut the availability of subsidised loans for public housing purchases.</p>
<p>"We can expect more bad news from the property sector as the oversupply situation mounts," said an analyst with a local house, adding he was also expecting further measures by the government.</p>
<p>The Singapore property market has seen two rounds of curbs so far.</p>
<p>The first was in May last year, aimed at speculators in the private housing market and the second, on April 12, targetted at those who realise capital gains on their public housing.</p>
