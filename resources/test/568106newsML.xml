<headline>Malaysia Hock Hua shares suspended.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-05-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) on Wednesday suspended trading in the shares of Hock Hua Bank Bhd on the company's request, a KLSE official said.</p>
<p>The Hock Hua shares closed at 11.7 ringgit a share on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The KLSE official said the suspension was to make a news announcement.</p>
<p>Officials at the bank's headquarters in the north Borneo state of Sarawak were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim had said in November last year that the government's economic adviser, Daim Zainuddin, and his associates had been granted permission to negotiate for the take over of a 70.7 percent subsidiary of Hock Hua Bank, the Hock Hua Bank (Sabah) Bhd.</p>
<p>No announcement of the sale has yet been made, and some brokers in the market said that could be the reason for the suspension of the bank's shares.</p>
<p>Hock Hua Bank is the sixteenth largest among the 37 banks in the country.</p>
