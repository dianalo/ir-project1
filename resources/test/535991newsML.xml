<title>USA: Banks told to go easy on flooded Plains borrowers.</title>

<p>Banks in three flood-ravaged Northern Plains states were urged Thursday to go easy on financially stressed borrowers whose homes and farms were damaged by raging waters.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve said banks in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota were told they "may find it appropriate to ease credit terms to help new borrowers restore their financial strength ... and to restructure debt or extend repayment terms to existing borrowers."</p>
<p>The Fed serves as the U.S. central bank. Its board passed a supervisory statement telling financial institutions in the three states to "work constructively" to help borrowers unable to meet their commitments because of the floods.</p>
<p>Huge areas of the states were inundated by floods that forced wholesale evacuations of towns, including the 50,000 citizens of Grand Forks, N.D. Melting snows continue to swell the northward-flowing Red River out of its banks all the way into Canada.</p>
<p>The Fed said it also was considering waiving its requirement for appraisals for real estate transactions since it is hard to do appraisals under flood conditions.</p>
<p>That would make it easier for borrowers to qualify and for banks to lend the money that will be needed for rebuilding once the floods subside.</p>
