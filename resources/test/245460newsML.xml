<p>Advanced Medical Inc Tuesday said it its resturtcuring its operations, a move which will result in 225 job cuts and an unspecified fourth quarter charge.</p>
<p>In a statement, the company said the moves reflect the recent acquisition of IVAC Medical Systems Inc and the merger of its IMED Corp subsidiary with IVAC.</p>
<p>The San Diego-based provider of marketing of intravenous infusion therapy products, vital signs instruments and related disposables said it has begun to reduce staffing in the combined company to 1,375 employees from about 1,600.  </p>
<p>"The restructuring will have the greatest impact on corporate staff and manufacturing, since the companies were practically mirror images of each other," William Mercer, president and chief executive officer.</p>
<p>Approximately 125 positions were eliminated Tuesday and another 100 positions will be phased out over the next six months.  By decreasing redundancy within the work force and through improved manufacturing efficiencies, the company said it expects to continue to lower its overall operating expenses. "These efforts are expected to have an immediate positive impact on operations," it added.  </p>
<p>The company also said it will consolidate its two disposable device manufacturing facilities in Tijuana in the second half of 1997. The facilities employ over 1,100 contract workers, and the company said it is examining various manufacturing alternatives in Tijuana.</p>
<p>"Additional changes are also underway which are intended to improve service and distribution, research and development, and sales and marketing throughout the United States and Canada," the company added.</p>
<p>The company said the European operations of IMED will be integrated into the IVAC infrastructure in Basingstoke, Hampshire, United Kingdom. Approximately 20 employees will be affected as IMED's operations are integrated into the IVAC European sales and marketing organization.</p>
<p>The company said it is continuing to explore its alternatives for a Japanese partner, and is expanding its operations in Asia/Pacific and Latin American regions.</p>
