<p>The trade gap between Britain and the rest of the world is expected to have slimmed significantly in October, helped by a sharp fall in the non-EU trade deficit, analysts said.</p>
<p>While markets will be wary of any sign that tighter monetary policy and a sturdy currency are undermining exports, analysts said these influences were unlikely to show through just yet.</p>
<p>"Interest rates have fed through to the exchange rate but I think it will be some time before they feed into exports," said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International in London.</p>
<p>"Sterling's recent strength will undermine exports, but I would be very surprised if it was evident as early as in the November data," he said.</p>
<p>A Reuter poll of economists suggests the October global trade deficit will have narrowed to 659 million stg from 899 million stg in September.</p>
<p>November's non-EU trade gap is expected to widen to 641 million stg from 424 million previously. Both numbers are due at 0930 GMT on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Data already published revealed a sharp contraction in the non-EU trade deficit during October," said David Philpotts, economist at Schroder Economics in London.</p>
<p>"This bodes well for the whole world figure."</p>
<p>Data released last month showed a dramatic tightening of the non-EU trade gap for October, which almost halved to 424 million stg from 805 million stg in September.</p>
<p>Imports from non-EU countries remained reasonably level, dipping to 6,696 million stg from 6,710 million stg in Sepember.</p>
<p>Philip Uglow, economist at Union Discount in London, said the hefty 899 million stg gap in September global trade could be put down to a deterioration in the non-EU position.</p>
<p>But he also expected the improvement seen in last month's data to filter through on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Given that we expect to see only a slight widening of the EU balance, we are forecastng the total shortfall to narrow to 575 million stg in October," he said.</p>
<p>Analysts said financial markets would keep a keen eye on imports figures in the worldwide trade data, watching for any evidence that the consumer recovery was boosting buying of foreign goods.</p>
<p>"Traditionally the UK has suffered from a high level of import penetration," said Stamenkovic. "And given that consumer spending is picking up, markets will be nervous if there is any significant rise in imports."</p>
