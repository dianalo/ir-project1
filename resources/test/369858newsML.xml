<headline>US Sen Daschle seeks agreement on USTR nominee.</headline>
<dateline>WASHINGTON 1997-02-11</dateline>

<p>Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota said he hoped to reach agreement with Sen. Ernest Hollings on legislation needed to confirm Charlene Barshefsky as U.S. Trade Representative.</p>
<p>Because she worked for Canada before becoming deputy USTR, Congress must pass a bill waiving a law that bars those who have worked for foreign interests from becoming USTR.</p>
<p>Hollings, D-S.C., has said he will offer an amendment to the bill requiring congressional approval for any trade agreement negotiated under the World Trade Organization that alters U.S. trade law or practices.  </p>
<p>Daschle and the Clinton administration would like Hollings to withdraw his amendment.</p>
<p>"I would hope we could resolve this. That (Hollings) amendment is not going to pass," Daschle told reporters. But he said the issue was still unresolved.</p>
<p>Barshefsky's nomination has been approved by the Senate Finance Committee and is awaiting action by the full Senate.</p>
<p>Both the House and Senate must pass the waiver bill but only Senate approval is needed to confirm Barshefsky's nomination. She has been acting USTR since last year.</p>
