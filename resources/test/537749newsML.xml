<p>Sterling was recovering some lost ground in moderate Asian trading on Thursday following its sharp sell-off overnight, Asian currency traders said.</p>
<p>"Sterling's coming back. The view here is that the U.S. sold sterling off too sharply so this represents a good buying opportunity," the head of Treasury at a European bank said.</p>
<p>At 0345 GMT sterling was quoted at 2.7890/7900 marks compared with late European quotes on Wednesday of 2.7768/7778. Against the U.S. dollar it was trading at 1.6280/90 versus late European quotes of 1.6230.  </p>
<p>Sterling was sold heavily on Wednesday after publication of an ICM opinion poll which showed the British opposition Labour Party's lead over the ruling Conservatives drop in the run up to the general election on May 1.</p>
<p>Most of the selling had been doen by U.S. traders.</p>
<p>The poll, in the Guardian newspaper showed Labour's lead collapse to a mere five percentage points from a previous 14.</p>
<p>However, a Gallup rolling opinion poll published at the same time in the Daily Telegraph newspaper showed Labour having a 21 point lead ahead of the May 1 general election.  </p>
<p>The head of trading at another European bank in Singapore said the market was treating the ICM finding as a rogue poll.</p>
<p>"There are bound to be plenty of jitters and nervousness ahead of next Friday and this is an example of that," he said.</p>
<p>"What this (sterling's fall) does show clearly is that the market is petrified at the idea of a hung parliament," he added.</p>
<p>The Treasury head agreed. "There's no doubt about it. A hung parliament (where no one party has an overall majority) is the worst possible scenario for sterling," he said.  </p>
<p>"The market as a whole wants a victory one way or another. A hung parliament purely means we have to go through the same old campaigning rubbish again a few months later," he added.</p>
<p>He said a hung parliament would almost certainly be unable to function effectively, paralysing the economic plans of the two main parties.</p>
<p>The head of trading said that a reasonable trading range for sterling/mark at present was 2.77 to 2.82 marks.</p>
<p>He added, "What we saw overnight was the rate drop down to close to the bottom of that range. What do you do? Buy."</p>
<p>On cable, he said he had seen demand from U.S. hedge funds.  </p>
<p>"One of the guys here suggested they were buying it just so they could dump it shortly after London opens. I'm not so sure. They could have been covering profitable shorts," he said.</p>
<p>He said the most volume he had seen during the Asian morning was in sterling/yen. At 0340 GMT it was quoted at 205.50 having hit a low in Europe of around 204.50.</p>
<p>The Treasury head predicted that sterling would remain volatile in the run-up to Thursday's voting.</p>
<p>"I imagine the Tories (Conservatives) will begin to eat into Labour's lead somewhat. I never thought I'd be saying this, but that could frighten some people off. We need a clear result."  </p>
<p>The head of trading added, "Nothing will be certain until the day. There'll no doubt be some fun and games between now and then."</p>
