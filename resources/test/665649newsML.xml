<p>CompDent said it expects to complete the transaction early in the third quarter.  </p>
<p>David Klock, chairman and chief executive officer of CompDent, said, "CompDent, through (Dental Health Management), has a very healthy acquisition pipeline of dental facilities in other significant CompDent markets, and currently has sufficient cash flow and bank-borrowing capacity to meet our acquisition needs."</p>
<p>In addition to the acquisition of the 21 dental facilities and the long-term management contract, CompDent, through Dental Health Management, has secured an option to acquire nine other dental facilities currently managed by Workman, as well as additional dental centers opened or acquired by Workman over the next four years in the states of Illinois, Indiana or Missouri.</p>
<p>Dental Health Management Inc, based in Nashville, Tenn., provides dental practice management services to dental practices and is a wholly owned subsidiary of CompDent.</p>
