<p>The FTSE 100 index will retreat to the 4,950-4,970 region on Monday having lost all ambitions to break into record ground last week, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>Interest rate sensitive stocks including the banks and utilities will suffer today's downturn, they added.</p>
<p>The market's swift about-turn on Friday will ensure selling pressure continues as those who were slow off the mark on Friday will clamber to take profits.</p>
<p>"It will be a case of selling on rallies," said one analyst, adding that fear of inflationary pressure in the U.S. leading to higher interest rates over there will send UK stocks lower.</p>
<p>"The nearest chart support (for the FTSE) is at 4,950-4,970," said the analyst who based his forecast from a an inspection of a daily bar chart of the index and its 10-day moving average -- the latter being at 4,960.</p>
<p>The U.S. long bond fell below chart support at $101-28, taking the yield up to over 6.6 percent and which caused the fallout in the UK and U.S. on Friday.</p>
<p>Analysts predict the yield could go anywhere between 6.75-7.75 percent short-term which will put pressure on equities as the market awaits inflation reports from the U.S. in the form of producer prices on Wednesday and consumer prices on Thursday.</p>
<p>"If this data shows U.S. inflation is on the march, equities on both sides of the Atlantic will take a dive," said one analyst.</p>
<p>By 0744 GMT, the FTSE was down 53.8 to 4,977.5.</p>
