<p>Latvia's parliament on Thursday voted to set up a special committee to investigate the taking and use of credits provided in the framework of the G24.</p>
<p>The credits, put as high as $300 million by some politicians, have been controversial as some MPs say they have been abused and not used for the purpose meant.</p>
<p>The committee, which will sit until June 1, has to investigate how these credits can be returned and whether anyone is guilty of squandering them, politicians said.</p>
<p>77 MPs backed the formation of the committee and noone opposed it.</p>
<p>Each parliament faction has to delegate a representative to the committee and it will probably begin sitting next week.</p>
<p>It is expected that largest parliament party, Saimnieks, will chair the committee.</p>
