<p>French luxury goods group LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton on Wednesday proposed to blend its wine and spirits businesses with those of British companies Guinness and Grand Metropolitan in an independent, listed company.</p>
<p>LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault outlined the plan to create a global drinks leader to the chairmen of the British groups at a meeting in Paris, held to discuss his opposition to their planned merger, LVMH said in a statement.</p>
<p>Grand Met chairman George Bull and Guinness chairman Tony Greener said they would consider Arnault's proposals so long as they offered more value for shareholders than their planned 24 billion pound merger, announced in May.</p>
<p>Analysts said it was not clear at first glance that Guinness and Grand Met shareholders would benefit from LVMH's proposal.</p>
<p>But LVMH said it would "create significantly greater value for the shareholders of the three companies than the merger proposed by Guinness and Grand Met, both in terms of potential synergies and market valuation of a coherent company with a portfolio of prestige brands, clearly a leader in its market".</p>
<p>Moet Hennessy, LVMH's drinks subsidiary, makes Moet &amp; Chandon and Pommery champagnes and Hennessy cognacs. Guinness's labels include Johnny Walker and Dewar's whiskies and Gordon's Gin. Grand Met brands include Smirnoff, J&amp;B and Baileys.</p>
<p>Analysts say LVMH would hold 30 to 35 percent of the drinks giant with a market capitalisation of roughly 70 billion francs ($11.9 billion).</p>
<p>They say Arnault is fighting to keep from being marginalised in the drinks business by the Guinness-Grand Met megamerger or having his capital locked up in a subsidiary of the new drinks-to-fast-food GMG Brands.</p>
<p>LVMH holds 14.2 percent of Guinness. It would have only about 10 percent of GMG Brands if the merger went through in its current form and would not even be assured a seat on the board.</p>
<p>The one-hour meeting of the three chairmen in Paris followed a two-pronged assault by Arnault on the British companies. In the past two weeks LVMH has spent more than eight billion francs to buy 6.4 percent of Grand Met in an apparent bid to line up votes to block the merger.</p>
<p>LVMH had previously taken legal action against Guinness to force it to shed its stakes in valuable distribution ventures which they share. Those ventures hold the rights for 10 years to market Guinness brands in France, the United States and much of the Far East.</p>
<p>Financial analysts said Arnault looks like a credible threat but needs to prove that his plan would create more value for Guinness and Grand Met shareholders than the groups' planned merger.</p>
<p>"My very rough estimates suggest it would not be enhancing for Guinness and Grand Met shareholders," one analyst said, but added that it would be beneficial for LVMH.</p>
<p>The chairmen left the door open for a three-way deal but gave little sign of narrowing the gap between their positions, analysts said, predicting more volatility in the share prices.</p>
<p>LVMH's stock hit a year high of 1,642 francs early on Wednesday before turning lower to close down 1.19 percent at 1,580. ($ = 5.897 French Francs)</p>
