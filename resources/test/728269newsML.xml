<p>The Polish government on Tuesday decided to sell in a public offering at least 51 percent of its Powszechny Bank Kredytowy SA (PBK), PAP news agency quoted Finance Minister Marek Belka as saying.</p>
<p>"At least 51 percent of Powszechny Bank Kredytowy shares will be placed in a public offering," Belka said.</p>
<p>PAP said the decision meant the cancellation of a tender for up to 65 percent of PBK in which South Korea's Samsung Group was bidding against a consortium of four Polish financial institutions.</p>
<p>Under the original privatisation plan only 15 percent of PBK was to be sold in a public offering, expected in the fourth quarter of this year, with 65 percent earmarked for a strategic investor or a consortium and the rest set aside for the bank's employees and a special reserve for restitution claims.</p>
<p>The decision on the choice of the strategic investor has been delayed for months and Samsung earlier this month accused the Polish government of favouring the Polish offer even though it was less attractive financially.</p>
<p>Samsung was competing with a group made up of Bank Przemyslowo-Handlowy SA, Kredyt Bank, Polish Development Bank (PBR) and TUiR Warta insurer.</p>
<p>The Warsaw-based PBK is one of Poland's leading retail banks. HSBC Investment Services SA, which advised the government on the bank's privatisation, has estimated its value at between 1.2-1.6 billion zlotys.</p>
<p>No government or bank officials were immediately available for comment. -- Warsaw Newsroom +48 22 653 9700</p>
