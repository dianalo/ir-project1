<headline>Norway share index falls but bank stocks soar.</headline>

<p>The Norwegian all-share index fell with overseas markets on Monday in reaction to Wall Street, but the bank index rose on the latest twist in the country's financial-sector restructuring saga.</p>
<p>"I think the Norwegian market held its position rather well compared to foreign markets," one broker said. "But I am very uncertain what will happen next."</p>
<p>A wave of U.S. data and earnings figures is due this week.</p>
<p>Oslo's Total index closed 0.69 percent lower at 1,055.95 points in moderate turnover of 986 million crowns, half of it in Fokus Bank, Norway's third largest commercial bank.  </p>
<p>Blue chip stock fell but shares in Fokus closed six crowns, or 8.76 percent, higher at 74.50 crowns following a hostile takeover bid by Sparebankgruppen, a group of 16 savings banks.</p>
<p>"There was focus on Fokus," one broker said. "I think the share will drop to 73 crowns because it is too expensive as it stands now."</p>
<p>Sparebankgruppen said it was bidding 73 crowns per share for Fokus, which moved forward the date for its first-quarter result announcement to Tuesday April 15 from April 25 because of the takeover bid.</p>
