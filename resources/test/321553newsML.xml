<p>Israeli shares closed higher on Tuesday in mixed trading as fears of a decline in Israeli high tech companies traded on the Nasdaq faded, traders said</p>
<p>The benchmark Mishtanim index of the top 100 shares rose 0.76 percent, or 1.83 points, to 243.33 on all-share turnover of 148 million shekels against 136 million shekels on Monday.</p>
<p>The Maof 25 blue chip index closed 0.79 percent higher at 253.23.</p>
<p>"Investors gained confidence when they saw that U.S. markets did not decline on Monday and that Israeli high tech stocks did not suffer losses despite earlier expectations," said Eyal Kolka of Sigma Securities.</p>
<p>"The session opened with mild gains but towards the end of the trading day the mood improved and the market gained momentum," Kolka added.</p>
<p>"The market has risen fast (in the last several weeks) and it is now expected to stabilise at the current level," said Ron Weisberg of IBI Investment House. "The market is showing strength and I don't think we will see a strong correction in the next few days."</p>
<p>Israel Chemicals, the most active share, rose 1.5 percent to 346 agorot on volume of 8.5 million shekels. Two of its subsidiaries, Dead Sea Works and Dead Sea Bromine Group, said they are in negotiations to acquire a majority holding in a Czech producer of fine chemicals.</p>
<p>Dead Sea Works gained 0.25 percent to 925 agorot and Dead Sea Bromine rose 2.5 percent to 1,702 agorot.</p>
<p>Koor Industries, the second active share, lost 0.5 percent to 33,140 agorot on turnover of 6.0 million shekels.</p>
<p>The third active share was Bezeq Israel Telecom, which rose 3.0 percent to 880 agorot on volume of 4.8 million shekels. On Monday evening Bezeq's board of directors named Yoram Turbowicz as Bezeq's new managing director. He replaces Yitzhak Kaul.</p>
