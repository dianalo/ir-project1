<p>* Ringgit up on fresh demand from Malaysian corporates</p>
<p>* Dollar selling by exporters at 2.5090 helps ringgit</p>
<p>* Speculators seen short dollar/ringgit</p>
<p>* Ringgit gains seen limited by selling vs Sing dollar</p>
<p>The ringgit was marginally higher on Tuesday morning on dollar selling by exporters and corporates, dealers said on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>They said the gains were limited by selling against the Singapore dollar, which started on Monday evening in London.</p>
<p>"There was a big sell order on ringgit/Sing in London. When that happened dollar/Sing collapsed and dollar/ringgit shot up," said a European bank dealer in Singapore.</p>
<p>"At the same time one big party, funds related, sold dollar/ringgit. From then on it was bidded all the way up."</p>
<p>The dealer said technically too the ringgit was due for a rebound soon. "It could come before the week ends," he said.</p>
<p>A dealer with another European bank in Singapore said people were trading both ways in a very narrow range.  </p>
<p>He said there were some Malaysian exporters selling dollars at 2.5090 and speculators were picking up dollars around 2.5070.</p>
<p>"If the 2.5110 level holds for the next couple of days, then we should see dollar/ringgit moving down," the dealer said.</p>
<p>He said the selling of dollar/Sing was mainly by U.S. funds, who had built up positions in anticipation of the New York Commodities Exchange launching futures contracts in Asian currencies.</p>
<p>But, the NYCE has postponed the launch of dollar/Sing futures contract, partly due to pressure from Singapore.</p>
<p>"This is causing many to dump dollar/Sing," he said.</p>
<p>Thai baht, ringgit and Indonesian rupiah futures contracts are expected to be launched by</p>
<p>At 0330 GMT, the ringgit was at 2.5085/95 a dollar.</p>
