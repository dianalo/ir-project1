<p>The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) said it will offer real-time data on the Internet, effective immediately.</p>
<p>LIFFE signed agreements a few weeks ago with three quote vendors to supply its real-time bond, interest rate and equity price data to people with Internet access, said Simon Orebi Gann, LIFFE's managing director of technology.</p>
<p>To obtain the data, which include pit bid and offer prices, subscribers will have to pay a fee, of which LIFFE will get a portion, he said.</p>
<p>The three quote vendors include Electronic Share Information (ESI), Telekurs and Virtual Telecom, the exchange said.</p>
<p>"The ability to distribute real-time data via the fast growing medium of the world wide web will ensure that more end users will have access to LIFFE prices therefore, enabling them to manage their investments better," said LIFFE chief executive Daniel Hodson in a statement.</p>
<p>LIFFE already provides delayed price quotes free via its website.</p>
