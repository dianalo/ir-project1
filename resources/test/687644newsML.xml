<p>Mining entrepreneur Joseph Gutnick said on Wednesday his Mt Kersey Mining NL would resume drilling within weeks on its leases surrounding the rich Silver Swan nickel mine in Western Australia.</p>
<p>Gutnick said he believed disputes with local Aboriginal land-owners had been resolved and Mt Kersey would now be able apply for the mining licence needed to further develop the leases.  </p>
<p>"We believe that we have resolved those issues and we're now applying for a mining lease and we'll be drilling these very exciting prospects within the coming weeks," Gutnick said in a speech to the Australia-Israel Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Production at the A$46 million Silver Swan nickel mine was scheduled to start this month.</p>
<p>Silver Swan is the first of a string of new nickel projects to be developed in Western Australia's latest nickel boom, centered on the eastern goldfields region.</p>
<p>Silver Swan is owned jointly by Outokumpu Oy and Mining Project Investors Pty Ltd.  </p>
<p>The Silver Swan discovery was made in November 1995 by MPI and Outokumpu 45 km north east of Kalgoorlie, surprising much of the town's mining establishment and sending stock prices of neighbouring mining companies soaring.</p>
<p>Gutnick's Mt Kersey, Australian Diamond Exploration NL and Ashton Mining Ltd were among the beneficiaries.</p>
