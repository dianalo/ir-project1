<p>The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said Monday it would hold a conference on May 29-30 to discuss "the important issues facing the natural gas industry today."</p>
<p>The aim of the conference would be to help the commission map out future regulation of the industry, now that there is competition in wholesale natural gas sales and growing competition for interstate transmission capacity.</p>
<p>One issue of concern was utility control over local gas markets, which the FERC said "may translate into the exercise of market power in the interstate transportation market."</p>
<p>It wanted to know if there were any pipeline regulations that were impeding natural gas trades.</p>
<p>The commission said it was seeking input on whether natural gas customers wanted the ability to trade gas and pipeline capacity on an hourly basis.</p>
<p>It also suggested that further improvements might be needed to improve industry reliability and at lower cost.</p>
<p>Criteria for approving new pipeline facilities might also be on the agenda for the conference, the commission said.</p>
