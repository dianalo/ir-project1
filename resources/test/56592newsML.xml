<p>The IRA may be moving towards a new ceasefire, Irish media reports said on Monday, but Sinn Fein, the guerrilla group's political wing, ruled out an early truce.</p>
<p>Irish newspapers predicted peace moves by the Irish Republican Army, despite rebuttals by its republican supporters.</p>
<p>Quoting security sources, press reports said the leadership of the IRA, which has fought a long war against British rule in Northern Ireland, may be planning a special secret convention to consider restoring a 17-month truce abandoned last February.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein's chief stategist, Martin McGuinness, who said he had no knowledge of the guerrillas' intentions, poured cold water on the reports.</p>
<p>Accusing Britain of "dogged intransigence", McGuinness said in radio interviews that there was little prospect of an IRA ceasefire before Britain brings Sinn Fein into peace talks.</p>
<p>"I think that anyone who thinks that it (an imminent truce) is likely -- given the events of the past two years -- is living in cloud cookoo land...," he said on BBC radio.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein has been excluded from all-party peace talks on a political settlement in Northern Ireland because of an IRA refusal to reinstate the ceasefire.</p>
<p>"On this occasion, I believe it is absolutely essential, if there is to be any hope whatsoever of gaining a second IRA cessation that the British government must move...to put in place the process of real, meaningful negotiations," McGuinness said.</p>
<p>"IRA's top command structure may call ceasefire," the Irish Times said supporting British newspaper reports that the guerrillas are planning a secret conference to thrash out strategy.</p>
<p>The Irish Independent, also published in Dublin, said senior police officers in the Irish capital believe that most of the IRA's leaders favour reinstating the ceasefire, which London and Dublin says would be the passport for Sinn Fein into talks.</p>
<p>According to the Irish media, recent setbacks have fuelled a new mood which is swinging support behind the "peace strategy" spearheaded by Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams, and his chief lieutenant McGuinness.</p>
<p>These include hostility in the Irish Republic, where the IRA has its administrative base, after the IRA killing of a policeman during a bungled robbery, as well as seizures in Britain and Ireland of large quantities of bomb making equipment.</p>
<p>Irish Prime Minister John Bruton caused puzzlement at home when he said during a trip to the United States last week that an IRA ceasefire might be on the cards.</p>
<p>Irish Times security editor Jim Cusack reported that Bruton had been briefed by security chiefs that "there had ben very clear intelligence reports of preparations for an IRA General Army Convention preceding a ceasefire."</p>
