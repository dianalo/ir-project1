<p>WellCare Mangament Group Inc said Thursday its first quarter results were hurt by Medicaid rate cuts.</p>
<p>The company also said the quarter was impacted by the New York State Insurance Department demographic pool assessment and adverse loss development due to the late receipt and recording of claims.</p>
<p>The company said it was informed by New York State in April of a retroactive and prospective Medicaid premium rate reductions and of an assessment related to the New York State demographic pool.</p>
<p>The company said this invalidated some of its assumptions and estimates and required it to record a series of charges.</p>
<p>The company said its first quarter loss per share was $2.06. It recorded no earnings per share for the same period a year ago.</p>
