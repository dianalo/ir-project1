<p>Sri Lanka is confident of netting well in excess of budgeted revenue targets from privatisations in 1997, Mano Tittawella, director general of the Public Enterprise Reform Commission (PERC), said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I am confident we will raise the five billion rupees ($86.2 million) needed to meet budgeted revenue targets in 1997 from plantation sector reforms and the sale of a few government minority holdings in companies," Tittawella told Reuters.</p>
<p>Critics have said the government's targets for revenue from privatisation have been too ambitious. Revenue fell far short of targets of 13 billion rupees and 21 billion rupees, set for fiscal 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>Privatisation of ownership of 23 regional estate firms, which began in late 1995, was expected to be completed this year, Tittawella said.</p>
<p>"The process, which includes selling 51 percent to a strategic investor and the balance to the public after giving 10 percent to employees, should net over four billion rupees."</p>
<p>Selling minority stakes in Lanka Ceramic and a few other firms should total five billion, he said.</p>
<p>PERC, which oversees the privatisations, said it also intended divesting government holdings in the Ceylon Hotels Corporation and selling debentures in the National Development Bank.</p>
<p>"We believe the macro economic environment, stock market conditions and investor perceptions are all conducive to these divestitures," Tittawella said.</p>
<p>PERC expects the largest chunks of revenue to come from selling 40 percent and management in the ailing national carrier Airlanka and 35 percent and management of Sri Lanka Telecom.</p>
<p>Post-bid negotiations were being conducted on both Airlanka and Telecom, with final decisions expected well within fiscal 1997, said Tittawella.</p>
<p>He said PERC was negotiating with six final bidders on Airlanka, including two high profile Asian carriers, and with Japan's NTT and France Telecom for Sri Lanka Telecom.</p>
<p>He did not give financial details of the deals.</p>
<p>"All I will say is that we are confident of getting well in excess of the budgeted revenue target for 1997," he said.</p>
<p>PERC will also shed the seven previously privatised firms taken over under the Public Enterprise Rehabilitation Act by end 1997, Tittawella said. "But I don't see much of a revenue inflow from these firms due to heavy debts."</p>
<p>The law was confined to Pugoda Textiles, Colombo Commercial Fertilizer, Hingurana Sugar, Kantalai Sugar, Kahatagaha Graphite, Lanka Loha Hardware and Mattegama Textiles.</p>
<p>The law was passed to take over the seven firms which were privatised by the previous government and making losses due to mismanagement.</p>
<p>The government of President Chandrika Kumaratunga came to power in 1994, ending the 17-year rule of the United National Party.</p>
<p>Tittawella said PERC's agenda for the next two years was full with reforms planned in the areas of transport, milk and agriculture, energy, sugar, fertilizer, mining and quarrying and manufacturing.</p>
<p>"We also want to kick off a study in 1998 to look at government holdings in non-commercial areas of financial services, including liberalising the insurance industry," Tittawella said.</p>
