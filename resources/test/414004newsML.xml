<p>The Shadow Open Market Committee on Monday warned the Federal Reserve not to meddle with the high-flying stockmarket but said it should continue to seek zero inflation in setting policy.</p>
<p>The group of academic and business economists also said that the growth of the monetary base should not exceed two percent this year.</p>
<p>In the year ended February, the monetary base -- bank reserves and currency -- grew by approximately 5.4 percent, the committee said, adding that achieving its policy recommendation "will require a near-term increase in the federal fund rates target."  </p>
<p>The committee, in its review of current monetary and economic conditions, said the current upswing in business "shows no sign of dying of old age or exploding into an inflationary boom."</p>
<p>The committee also attacked President Clinton's budget for fiscal 1998, saying that unless much more is done to reduce spending, the budget deficit would rise year after year to record peacetime levels.</p>
<p>The committee said the president's budget promises a balance in 2002. But it said that even if this could be achieved, it would be "a hollow accomplishment" since it would be out of balance in 2003 and subsequent years.</p>
