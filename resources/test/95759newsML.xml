<p>Most U.S. spot products edged lower with futures on Friday after giving up early moderate gains, but vigorous exports to Europe helped Gulf distillates hold their own, players said.</p>
<p>Colder weather in the Northeast had pushed prods moderately higher in the morning, but prices retreated amid profit taking in the futures market, traders said.</p>
<p>European traders said Friday as many as four million barrels of U.S. distillates had been fixed to sail to Europe in October to meet the continent's keen demand for 0.2 and 0.05 percent sulfur grades.</p>
<p>U.S. Gulf Coast traders said the export activity had enlivened their market the past few days, helping to firm differentials on low sulfur diesel 0.20 cent Friday to about 1.10 cents below the November print.</p>
<p>"It looks like eight or ten cargoes will be moving to Europe the first half of October," one Gulf trader said, adding more were likely to follow.</p>
<p>"The exports are going to cut into our own stocks," another Gulf trader said, noting U.S. distillate levels were the lowest in a generation and likely to keep upward pressure on U.S. prices as colder weather sets in.</p>
