<title>USA: CME hogs end off sharply on profit taking.</title>
<headline>CME hogs end off sharply on profit taking.</headline>

<p>Continued profit taking drove CME hog and pork belly futures to sharply lower closes, traders said.</p>
<p>Hogs closed 1.300 to 0.175 lower with April off 1.100 at 73.175 cents. Pork bellies ended 2.900 to 0.850 lower with May off most at 75.950 cents.</p>
<p>Commercial and commission house profit taking kept futures pressured with sell stops adding to the early setback. The market appeared overbought after three days of limit gains following the banning of pork exports from Taiwan due to an outbreak of foot and mouth disease, traders said.</p>
<p>"It's a little bit of correction against the trend - bearish guys used the rally to get short and the guys who caught part of this move are tempted to sell out and take a little profit," said Dennis Smith, broker with LIT division of First Options.</p>
<p>Expectations the U.S. pork industry would receive the most benefit from the Taiwan situation boosted futures to a very large premium over current cash hog prices. Topping action in both cash pork products and live markets added to incentive to take profits. Cash hogs were called steady to $0.50 per cwt lower Wednesday, traders said.  </p>
<p>A Taiwan agriculture official said it would be difficult to resume pork exports to Japan within five years. Also, the disease as of early Tuesday had been detected at 357 breeding centers, up from nine just five days ago.</p>
<p>Smith added that he did not see anything to alter the bullish situation in regards to Taiwan but many traders were starting to focus on the Hogs and Pigs report.</p>
<p>Analysts' estimates for all U.S. hogs as of March 1 averaged 99.2 percent of a year ago in a range of 97 to 100.9 percent. Hogs kept for breeding averaged 101.4 percent of a year ago and ranged 98.5 to 104 and hogs kept for market averaged 99 percent and ranged 96 to 100.8 percent.</p>
<p>Rand Financials bought April and sold June after late buying by ABN Chicogo Corp and E.D.&amp;F. Man in June. In hog options, commission house were on both sides of June and July puts and calls and they were trying to do risk reversals in October, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Pork bellies fell on profit taking and cash price concerns. Fund selling hit values late before another fund bought, keeping May from sinking the daily limit.</p>
<p>Demand for bellies again abated when cash prices reached $75 per cwt, which USDA quoted at midday, sources noted.</p>
<p>Analysts also noted that bacon is not one of the pork items that would see heavy demand from the Taiwan export stoppage. Also, belly stocks have continued to increase as the board allowed a hedge, they said.</p>
<p>After the close, the CME reported a net in-movement of 926,000 lbs of pork bellies into CME approved warehouses outside Chicago in its weekly out-of-town report. The figure was under trade estimates for in-movement of 1.0 million to 2.0 million lbs and well under net in-movement of 2.486 million lbs last week. Last year's net in-movement was 709,000 lbs.</p>
