<p>The "comfort food" of America's family-style restaurants -- meat loaf, patty melts, milkshakes and burgers -- is loaded with artery-clogging fat, a consumer watchdog group said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The non-profit Center for Science in the Public Interest, which has previously targetted movie theater popcorn and Chinese restaurant cuisine, analyzed popular meals from restaurant chains like Denny's and Shoney's.</p>
<p>"Family-style restaurants may be cheap, but if you don't want to blow the savings on doctor bills, order with extreme care," the center's senior nutritionist Jayne Hurley said in a statement.</p>
<p>A serving of meatloaf contains a whole day's allowance of fat, without even considering a side dish of mashed potatoes and gravy, the center said in a statement.</p>
<p>A patty melt, a 1950s specialty that is a cheeseburger with fried onions between two slices of grilled rye bread, features more than a day's worth of fat. Have it with a vanilla milkshake and an order of fries and the meal has three day's worth of fat, equivalent to four Big Mac sandwiches.</p>
<p>The milkshakes at family-style restaurants are far fattier than those sold at fast-food franchises like MacDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's, the center said.</p>
<p>Even a plain hamburger at a family-style restaurant uses up three-fourths of a day's fat quota, according to the center.</p>
<p>But there are healthier choices to be had. Pot roast, mashed potatoes and a side order of vegetables make "quite a decent 600-calorie meal," the center said.</p>
<p>Chicken stir-fry with rice includes just one-third of a day's fat quota, and many family-style eateries offer grilled chicken or fish, a baked potato with sour cream or salads with low-calorie dressing.</p>
<p>Chains sampled at 26 U.S. family-style restaurants were Bakers Square, Big Boy, Bob Evans, Carrows, Coco's, Country Kitchen, Cracker Barrel, Denny's, Friendly's, IHOP, Marie Callender's, Perkins, Shoney's and Village Inn.</p>
