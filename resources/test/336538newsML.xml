<p>Almost half of China's 70,000 industrial state enterprises ended 1996 in the red despite layoffs of about four million workers due to production cuts and bankruptcies, a senior government statistician said on Monday.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 industrial state enterprises -- or 43.7 percent of the total -- posted losses in 1996, up five percentage points from the previous year, Qiu Xiaohua, spokesman for the State Statistical Bureau, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Their combined losses climbed 20 percent in 1996 to 61.6 billion yuan ($7.4 billion) from 1995, Qiu said.</p>
<p>"The losses of some enterprises are outstanding," he said.</p>
<p>Qiu blamed the mounting losses on "blind" investment, or excessive investment in industries that appear to be profitable and which is leading to cut-throat competition, monopolies and local protectionism.</p>
<p>For example, all but one of China's 30 provinces and municipalities are turning out television sets while 23 regions have plunged into manufacturing cars, refrigerators and washing machines resulting in saturation, he said.</p>
<p>The government has vowed to curb such "blind" investment, which has resulted in goods stockpiled in warehouses, ranging from shirts to bicycles and wristwatches.</p>
<p>Funds of state enterprises tied up in excessive stockpiles totalled 150 billion yuan ($18.1 billion) at the end of last year, Qiu said.</p>
<p>"The problem of goods piling up and debts owed to each other has not turned for the better," Qiu said.</p>
<p>"Costs are higher...due to excessive competition."</p>
<p>Qui said four million state enterprise workers, or about five percent of the total, were now out of work.</p>
<p>Chinese sources say the figure is much bigger, with 27 percent of such labourers laid off or still on the payroll but taking a huge pay cut.</p>
<p>The government has been reluctant to push many of its loss-making state enterprises into bankruptcy due to fears of mass unemployment and social unrest.</p>
<p>Economic tsar Zhu Rongji has called for further mergers of lumbering state enterprises and fewer bankruptcies.</p>
<p>Qiu insisted state enterprises were starting to see a dramatic turnaround.</p>
<p>The losses of state enterprises rose by 50.8 percent in the first half but the rate of increase slowed to 27.1 percent for the July-November period and to only 12 percent in the fourth quarter, Qiu said.</p>
<p>Qiu forecast the number of loss-making state enterprises would shrink to less than 30 percent of the total this year from 43.7 percent last year.</p>
<p>Profits of state firms plunged 88 percent in the first half of 1996, but fell only 20 percent in the second half and even jumped 14 percent in the fourth quarter, he said.</p>
<p>Sales were up and stockpiles down, he said, adding that bank deposits of state enterprises rose by 140 billion yuan ($16.9 billion) in 1996 to 502.6 billion yuan ($60.6 billion) compared with 1995.</p>
<p>Qiu attributed the recovery to two interest rate cuts last year. The cuts reduced interest payments of state enterprises by 70 billion yuan ($8.4 billion) a year, he said.</p>
