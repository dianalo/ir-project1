<headline>Exxon to take back previous gasoline claims - FTC.</headline>

<p>In a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, Exxon Corp has agreed to run a series of advertisements that will take back past claims that using premium gasoline will make cars run more efficiently, the FTC said Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The out-of-court settlement is seen as a landmark case by the FTC, marking the first time a major U.S. oil company will admit in public that most cars need only regular octane gasoline.</p>
<p>"This is the first time a major U.S. oil company is coming out and telling the truth about octane needs and telling consumers they don't need octane gas," said Joel Winston, FTC assistant director of advertising practices.  </p>
<p>According to the settlement, Exxon will begin running 15-second television advertisements in September in 18-major metropolitan markets, including New York City, Orlando, Florida, and Dallas, Texas.</p>
<p>The ads, carrying the message that most cars will run properly on regular octane gasoline, will be aired for two to three week periods in September and December until it has been determined that 75 percent of the television audience has been reached, said Winston.</p>
<p>Exxon will also make available information brochures at its 8,700 service stations nationwide.  </p>
<p>Exxon was not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>The FTC filed a lawsuit against Exxon last September alleging the oil giant made false advertising claims for its premium gasoline.</p>
<p>For the past several years the FTC has waged a consumer education campaign to warn drivers against spending more money on motor fuels with octane ratings above 87.</p>
<p>Exxon is the fourth major U.S. oil company to run afoul of the FTC for making unsubstantiated claims for its high octane fuel but the first not to settle before a suit was filed.</p>
