<p>Refining margins for Brent crude oil in northwest Europe showed little sign of improvement last week, remaining stubbornly below $1 a barrel at a complex refinery and in negative territory for simple hydroskimmers.</p>
<p>Margins for a typical complex refinery in the Rotterdam refining centre last week averaged a profit of 88 cents a barrel last week, up just eight cents on the week, according to Reuters price data using standard product yields.</p>
<p>A simple hydroskimming unit ran at a 47-cent loss for Brent last week versus a 60-cent loss the week before.</p>
<p>By comparison, cracking margins for the six months to February averaged almost $2 a barrel in northwest Europe, while hydroskimming margins averaged about 82 cents a barrel.</p>
<p>Average Mediterranean margins for Russian Urals last week also were stagnant, running at about $1 a barrel profit for a complex refinery and a 55-cent loss for a simple plant.</p>
<p>European refining margins were previously as poor in August of last year.</p>
<p>Traders said crude run cuts at several European refineries had made little impact on a sloppy products spot market, particularly for gas oil, the biggest cut of a barrel of crude which has suffered from a relatively mild winter in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Some Mediterranean refineries cut runs at the start of February but those in northern Europe resisted until last week when a number in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) region, home to almost two million bpd of capacity, reduced output by around 10 percent.</p>
<p>"The cutbacks only really seem to have taken effect in March. In February, especially following a cold January, (refineries) were running at full speed," said Peter Bogin, associate director at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris.</p>
<p>Irish National Petroleum Corp (INPC) has been running its 65,000 barrels per day (bpd) refinery at about 70 percent capacity since margins slid in early February.</p>
<p>"It's down to margins being terrible...It's very bad at the moment," said an INPC trader.</p>
<p>Fully-upgraded refiners have also reduced crude runs.</p>
<p>Last week, British Petroleum and Texaco cut throughput by about 12 percent at their 65-35 joint venture 400,000 bpd Nerefco complex in Rotterdam, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Shell has also reduced crude throughput at its 350,000 bpd Rotterdam refinery by a similar amount, sources said.</p>
<p>Firmer gasoline, helped by arbitrage demand from the United States, and the prospect of further gas oil exports to the Far East, the only major refining centre currently enjoying healthy margins thanks to scheduled maintenance shutdowns, could lift product prices this week, traders said.</p>
<p>And weaker crude, under pressure from an overhang of unsold North Sea and West African grades and ample supply of sour barrels in the Mediterranean, could also help pull margins off their seven-month lows.</p>
