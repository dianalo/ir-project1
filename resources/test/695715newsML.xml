<title>RUSSIA: Yeltsin daughter takes charge of his image-Kremlin.</title>

<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin appointed his increasingly influential daughter Tatyana Dyachenko as an official adviser on image-making on Monday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's press secretary Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news briefing that Tatyana, 37, would be responsible for the president's image.</p>
<p>The long-expected appointment formalises the role the president's younger daughter has been playing in the Kremlin since Yeltsin's successful re-election campaign last year.</p>
<p>Tatyana, emulating an image-softening role carved out by French President Jacques Chirac's daughter Claude, has grown to wield considerable influence within the redbrick walls of the Kremlin and beyond.</p>
<p>Some aides have grumbled she is the only person Yeltsin really listens to.</p>
<p>Yastrzhembsky did not give details of Tatyana's new job. She is a computer mathematician by education and has two sons -- Boris, born in 1981, and Gleb, born in 1995. Yeltsin and his wife Naina have an older daughter, Yelena.</p>
<p>Tatyana, the only member of the presidential family with a high political profile, played an important role in the analytical group of Yeltsin's election campaign staff, headed by the liberal reformer Anatoly Chubais.</p>
<p>Chubais, now one of two first deputy prime ministers in Yeltsin's revamped government, has said Tatyana should be given the role of "common sense" adviser in the Kremlin and hinted at the start of June that she was likely to get this job.</p>
<p>She was instrumental in providing a direct link between the liberals and Yeltsin in the most tense periods of the campaign.</p>
<p>Since then Tatyana has accompanied Yeltsin on most of his trips but hitherto has not been given an official role.</p>
