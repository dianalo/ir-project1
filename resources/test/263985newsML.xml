<p>Peruvian rebels who stormed the Japanese ambassador's home in Lima threatened on Wednesday to kill at least 200 hostages, including high-ranking foreign diplomats, unless the government freed jailed comrades.</p>
<p>Foreign countries with nationals being held in the dramatic siege appealed for calm in dealing with the crisis. Spain cautioned that the use of military force could lead to a massacre.</p>
<p>Hostages included Peru's Foreign Minister Francisco Tudela, Agriculture Minister Rodolfo Munante Sanguineti, Supreme Court President Moises Pantoja, at least three local legislators, and numerous ambassadors and diplomats from around the world, according to witnesses and officials.</p>
<p>President Alberto Fujimori told Japan's Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto by telephone that about 200 people were being held. Fujimori said Interior Minister Juan Briones Davila was negotiating with the guerrillas to seek the release of the hostages, according to Japan's Foreign Ministry.</p>
<p>The Cuban-inspired Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrillas, who called the operation "Breaking The Silence," claimed they held 250 hostages after the release of about 80 women and old people.</p>
<p>"If they do not release our prisoners, we will all die in here," an MRTA guerrilla told a local radio station from within the embassy residence.</p>
<p>The released hostages came out of the residence dazed and crying. "They are freeing us to show that they are not doing us any harm," said one woman.</p>
<p>Japan's foreign minister told a news conference the Japanese ambassador to Peru said he saw no signs of negotiations going on to free the hostages, who were captured while attending a party to honour the Japanese emperor's birthday.</p>
<p>"He (the ambassador) said there was no feeling around him inside the residence that negotiations are going on," Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda said of his 10-minute phone call with ambassador Morihisa Aoki early on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ikeda, who said about 60 Japanese were among the hostages, quoted the ambassador as saying there was one injured person in the residence. It was not clear if the injured person was one of the guests at the reception or one of the guerrillas.</p>
<p>In a spectacular attack late on Tuesday, the guerrillas fired a rocket and sprayed bullets into the residency building before scaling walls and entering during the ensuing chaos, eyewitnesses and officials said.</p>
<p>A series of small explosions and gunfire were heard as the rebels took control of the building in the middle-class, residential San Isidro area of Lima. The hostages were forced to lie face-down on the floor for about 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes urged Peru to avoid using military force to end the standoff, fearing it could lead to a massacre. The Spanish charge d'affaires in Lima, Estanislao de Grandes, was among the hostages.</p>
<p>Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar contacted Peru's President Alberto Fujimori and asked him to use psychological tactics to persuade the hostage-takers to stand down, Matutes said in a radio interview.</p>
<p>Poland, whose charge d'affaires was among the hostages, said the health and well-being of the captives was the top priority.</p>
<p>Other diplomats being held were Germany's ambassador to Peru, who was with around 15 other hostages in a room of the residence, the German Foreign Ministry said in Bonn.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel set up a crisis centre to deal with the siege and ordered a crisis specialist from Bonn to fly to the Peruvian capital, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Austria's ambassador to Peru was also being held hostage, the Austrian foreign ministry said. A spokeswoman said the ambassador was with a handful of other hostages in one of the residence's bathrooms. "He's sitting in the bathtub with the Germans," she said.</p>
<p>In Paris, the French Foreign Ministry said there was one French diplomat among the hostages.</p>
<p>Colombian Foreign Minister Emma Maria Mejia, on a visit to Paris, offered her country's help in settling the siege.</p>
<p>"This is very serious...I believe that of course we could cooperate if it were necessary but we trust Peru can solve this problem," she told Reuters.</p>
<p>In Washington, the White House declined to comment on whether any Americans were being held hostage. "We are monitoring the situation. We are consulting with the government of Peru," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The rebels said they had 400 to 500 comrades in jail and insisted their highest priority was the release of Victor Polay, their leader who was imprisoned in 1992.</p>
<p>The attack was a major blow to Fujimori's government, which had claimed virtual victory in a 16-year war on communist rebels belonging to the MRTA and the larger and better-known Maoist Shining Path.</p>
<p>Fujimori called an emergency meeting with his reduced Cabinet in the early hours of Wednesday.</p>
