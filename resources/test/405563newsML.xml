<p>Yukong Ltd, South Korea's largest oil refiner, is expected to post a net profit of about 65 billion won in calendar 1996, down sharply from 103.2 billion in 1995, a company official said on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>The official in Yukong's finance division said the refiner saw 1996 sales at around 8.3 trillion won against 6.59 trillion won in 1995.</p>
<p>"Decline in net profit is due mostly to foreign exchange loss," he said. The South Korean won fell 8.2 percent against the dollar last year.</p>
<p>A rise in crude oil prices also pressured the refiner, he said.</p>
<p>Yukong plans to release its corporate results on Friday.</p>
