<headline>Circuit City shares drops 9 percent on earnings warning.</headline>

<p>Shares of Circuit City Stores Inc. lost almost 9 percent Thursday after the electronics retailer warned it expected a 25 percent drop in first-quarter earnings for its Circuit City unit.</p>
<p>The stock lost $3.375 to $34.50 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was one of the most heavily traded issues.</p>
<p>Circuit City Chairman Richard Sharp said that, while the company's sales for the three months ended May 31 met expectations, its merchandise mix and promotional environment produced gross profit margins below expectations.</p>
<p>"As a result, we anticipate that first quarter earnings per share for the Circuit City Group will be approximately 25 percent lower than in last year's first quarter," Sharp said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company, which is based in Richmond, Va., said sales for the first two months were strong, but the trend changed in May, dragged down by a significant weakening of sales of personal computers.</p>
<p>Circuit City, which sells appliances as well as computers and consumer electronics, added that unseasonably cool weather also reduced air conditioner sales when compared with last May's strong performance.</p>
<p>The company will release its earnings June 16.</p>
