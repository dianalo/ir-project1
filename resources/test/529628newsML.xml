<p>Eramet said on Tuesday it was premature to declare force majeure on its New Caledonian ferronickel and nickel matte export contracts although two local trade unions are still blocking these exports.</p>
<p>But the group said there could be problems if the situation were to persist.</p>
<p>"At this stage there is still no need to declare force majeure," a company spokesman told Reuters.  </p>
<p>Between April 11 and April 20 workers from the local USOENC and USTKE unions prevented nickel ore from reaching Eramet's Domiambo plant in New Caledonia.</p>
<p>They also prevented nickel ore from being exported to large users abroad. This action, however, ended on April 20.</p>
<p>But Eramet's exports of ferronickel and nickel matte out of New Caledonia are still blocked, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>"Production at Domiambo has now returned to a normal pace but we cannot export our stocks," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>"This could be a problem if the situation drags on but there are still no problems for our clients", he added.</p>
<p>Eramet's ferronickel is sold to large users in the stainless steel industry while nickel matte is refined at Eramet's Sandouville plant in France.</p>
<p>The spokesman said it was premature to estimate the revenue shortfall for the company that might result from these actions.</p>
<p>Domiambo's nickel output was 53,413 tonnes in 1996 and was expected to reach 55,000 tonnes this year.</p>
<p>The union action is mostly aimed at drawing attention to the need for all major players in New Caledonia to work on a solution for a controversial plan to build a new nickel smelter in the north of the French territory.  </p>
<p>Eramet and the French government are in a dispute over the distribution of mining assets in New Caledonia. The government, which owns 55 percent of Eramet, has begun the process to remove Eramet's mining licence for the Koniambo mine in New Caledonia.</p>
<p>It wants to hand that licence to a local Kanak interest, stating Eramet has not operated the mine for 10 years. The Koniambo reserves would be used to supply ore to a nickel plant that Canadian group Falconbridge and local Kanak interests want to build in the north.</p>
<p>The project is part of a deal to appease Kanaks ahead of a 1998 referendum on independence for the French territory.</p>
<p>Eramet has until April 24 to explain why it did not operate Koniambo for 10 years. It may shed light on the situation when it details its 1996 earnings at a news conference the same day.</p>
<p>Eramet says the Koniambo mine is crucial to its plans to raise nickel production in New Caledonia to between 60,000 and 65,000 tonnes from the year 2000 from 54,000 tonnes currently.</p>
<p>Earlier this month Chairman Yves Rambaud said Eramet supported the project in the north as long as it was not detrimental to Eramet's development in New Caledonia. Rambaud called on all players to work on a solution.</p>
<p>The company spokesman declined to comment on the implication that President Jacques Chirac's decision to call a snap parliamentary election might have for future negotiations.</p>
