<p>The governor of Russia's oil-rich Tyumen region called on Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Thursday to halt privatisation of the Tyumen Oil Company.</p>
<p>"TNK should be preserved as it is and not turned into private property," Leonid Roketsky told a goverment meeting.</p>
<p>TNK, whose board chairman is former Fuel and Energy Minister Yuri Shafranik, is one of Russia's few remaining oil companies that is nearly 100 percent state-owned.</p>
<p>Russia has privatised most of its oil sector by turning former production associations into vertically-integrated or independent companies, and the sell-off is continuing.</p>
<p>TNK produced 21.30 million tonnes of crude oil in 1996, compared to 22.57 million tonnes in 1995.</p>
<p>Its main production units are Nizhnevartovskneftegaz and Tyumenneftegaz.</p>
