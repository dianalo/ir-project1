<headline>NWE gas oil stalls again in summer doldrums.</headline>

<p>European gas oil eased $1.75 a tonne on Monday but physical business remained sluggish in the depths of a seasonal summer lull, traders said.</p>
<p>September IPE futures closed at $169.25 a tonne, down $1.75 on heavy selling.</p>
<p>Physical business was slow with many traders on holiday. One Amsterdam trading office reported the quietest day of the year.</p>
<p>"It's been absolutely dreadful. The phones have hardly been ringing," a trader at the office of a major in Britain said.</p>
<p>"With temperatures at 33 degrees no one wants to think about heating oil," said another trader.</p>
<p>A small parcel of Rotterdam refinery heating oil  moved at September IPE flat, an unchanged level, in the morning, but traders said they saw nothing changing hands after lunch. Low sulphur diesel was steady at around $4.25 over September IPE.</p>
<p>On the cargo market, one trader saw tightness in the low sulphur diesel market out of the UK to the end of August but said September appeared well supplied.</p>
<p>Other traders saw diesel as closer to balanced, with spreads steady at around September IPE +$5. Heating oil into Germany was unchanged at around September +$0.25/$1.00.</p>
