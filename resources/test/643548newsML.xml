<p>The Sri Lankan rupee closed barely moved against the dollar in lacklustre Friday trading, dealers said.</p>
<p>The rupee closed at 58.58 to the dollar after opening at its previous closing level of 58.55, they said.</p>
<p>"The market was very quiet today. There was some significant commercial demand, but it wasn't enough to move the market," said an American Express Bank dealer.</p>
<p>Dealers said the dollar's lack of aggressiveness over the past couple of days has prompted banks to be more positive towards the rupee.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Central Bank pushed down the dollar by one local cent, fixing buying and selling prices at 58.3506 and 59.5294.</p>
<p>"When the dollar is not going up aggressively, the possibility is there for it to come down further. So banks are not buying and holding on to dollars any more," said a local bank dealer.</p>
<p>Overnight call money closed at 11 percent after opening at 10 percent, dealers said.</p>
