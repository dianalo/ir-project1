<p>Midfielder Ali Benarbia scored twice in less than four minutes as 10-man Monaco twice came from behind to draw 3-3 at Lyon on Sunday and stay seven points clear at the top of the French first division.</p>
<p>After 55 minutes and with the score tied at 1-1, Monaco captain Franck Dumas received his second red card of the season when he committed his second bookable offence of the evening.</p>
<p>Brazilian striker Anderson, scoring his 13th league goal of the season, put Monaco ahead in the eighth minute when he volleyed home a cross from midfielder Sylvain Legwinski.</p>
<p>But mid-table Lyon equalised 10 minutes later through striker Franck Gava who headed home a cross from Christophe Cocard whose goal just after the hour initiated a 10-minute four-goal spree.</p>
<p>Bernabia equalised in the 67th minute but, two minutes later, Ludovic Giuly put Lyon ahead again with his eighth goal of the season. Benarbia, however, ensured a share of the points when he levelled the score again in the 71st minute.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Bastia beat Strasbourg 3-1 at home to join Paris St Germain, held 1-1 by Cannes at the Parc des Princes on Saturday, in second place although PSG have the better goal difference.</p>
