<p>Facing the daunting task of curbing record unemployment, German government, opposition and business leaders on Monday said they wanted to revive talks on an "Alliance for Jobs" that collapsed earlier this year.</p>
<p>The willingness to return to the negotiating table to set the stage for job creation comes as politicians, trade unionists and business executives realise that economic growth alone is not putting people back to work.</p>
<p>Unemployment is expected to hit a record 4.5 million early next year, and Bonn politicians increasingly fear social unrest and possibly renewed trouble from neo-Nazi activists.</p>
<p>"There would be no harm in returning to the table. We are setting no conditions. We are ready to talk at any time," Chancellery Minister Friedrich Bohl told RTL television.</p>
<p>Hans Peter Stihl, head of the German Chambers of Industry and Commerce (DIHT), spearheaded the new initiative, saying if the government carried out its pledge of lowering tax rates "many tax exemptions for businesses could also be scrapped."</p>
<p>Speaking in Bonn, Stihl said employers must be ready to compromise on the volatile issue of cutting sick pay benefits, but that trade unions must also reevaluate their positions.</p>
<p>The original round of talks sought to win guarantees on job security and pledges of new investment from business leaders in exchange for compromises from trade unions to lower unit wage costs and create more flexible work practices.</p>
<p>But talks collapsed as business leaders took a tough line in wage negotiations early this year and the government began to campaign for legislation enabling employers to cut sick pay to 80 percent from 100 percent of normal wages.</p>
<p>But tempers now seem to be cooling and attention has swung back to the unanswered question of how to stop the rise in unemployment levels.</p>
<p>"If the chancellor calls, we will certainly be available again for talks," said Dieter Hundt, the newly-elected president of the Federation of German Employers (BDA), one of the main participants in the previous round of talks.</p>
<p>Rudolf Scharping, parliamentary leader of the main opposition Social Democrats (SPD), warned in an interview with the daily Bild that high unemployment could give rise to a "social explosion with all of its negative consequences, possibly even a return of right-wing extremism."</p>
<p>"Let us form a grand coalition of reason. Political parties, business and trade unions must join together in the fight against unemployment," he said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Federation of German Labour (DGB), the umbrella group for German trade unions, said the position of the unions had not changed. Unions would be willing to talk as long as the original aims were reconfirmed.</p>
<p>One of the original goals was a commitment to halve unemployment by the year 2000, an achievement that many political observers and independent economists now consider unattainable.</p>
