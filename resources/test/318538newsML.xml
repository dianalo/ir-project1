<p>Nicaragua's top coffee grower on Monday said Nicaragua will export about 850,000 quintales (100- pound bags) of coffee in its 1996-1997 cycle, a sharp drop from the 1.03 million quintales it had projected earlier.</p>
<p>The Nicaraguan Union of Coffee Growers (Unicafe) dropped its coffee production outlook for this cycle to one million quintales from the 1,215,867 quintales it had projected in November, Unicafe President Amilcar Navarro told Reuters in an interview..  </p>
<p>"This year's projected harvest has fallen by 25 percent. We hope that we can reach one million quintales," Navarro said.</p>
<p>Navarro attributed the output decline to a reduction in credit given to Nicaragua's indebted coffee growers, which prevented growers from buying sufficient fertilizer and fungicides, among other items.</p>
<p>Navarro said 30 percent of Nicaragua's plantations were attacked by a very aggressive plague of coffee leaf rust, and indebted farmers lacked the money for fungicide to fight it.</p>
<p>July's Hurricane Cesar and a snap of cold weather in northern Nicaragua in December and early January, have hurt production and stunted the beans' maturation. Producers are still set back by poor roads in coffee-growing regions, but the government has begun an emergency road reparation project, he said.</p>
