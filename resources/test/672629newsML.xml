<p>President Ernesto Zedillo, visiting a state where Marxist guerrillas fought the army last month, called on Thursday for peace and pledged to fight the region's poverty.</p>
<p>"Dialogue and tolerance are the only tools to resolve differences, to find responses to complaints, to advance united towards social justice," Zedillo told a predominantly Indian audience in the southwestern state of Guerrero.</p>
<p>"Today, when democracy is really getting stronger in Mexico, we must all reaffirm our commitment to peace and harmony," he added.</p>
<p>Guerrero is home to the Marxist Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR), which sprang up at a peasant rally last June 28. The group, which has attacked sporadically over the past year in at least six states, clashed twice with soldiers last month in Guerrero. At least nine people died in those attacks.</p>
<p>Zedillo was making his third visit to Guerrero this year. Officials said it was the first by a Mexican head of state to the inhospitable, arid and poor mountain region where the rebels have been most active.</p>
<p>At the launch of a $34 million regional aid plan in Olinala, 120 miles (180 km) south of Mexico City, Zedillo said everyone was obliged to fight poverty, regardless of their political party.</p>
<p>Roberto Cabrera, a local leader, welcomed the initiative but told the president more aid was needed. "We don't want to be given things for the rest of our lives," he said. "We don't want to be brought bags of corn flour or packets of milk."</p>
