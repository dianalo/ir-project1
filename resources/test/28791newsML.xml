<p>U.S. Midcontinent diesel fuel differentials firmed late Tuesday on reports of a delayed shipment of diesel barrels into the market, traders said.</p>
<p>A pumping problem delayed a 200,000 barrel diesel shipment being transferred into the Williams pipeline system from the Explorer pipeline until a later cycle, forcing some players into the spot market to cover, traders said.</p>
<p>The demand for early September barrels boosted differentials, and prices surged on a nearly 2.0 cent a gallon rise on front-month heating oil futures as the market reopened following the Labor Day holiday weekend.  </p>
<p>Spot trade was described as relatively thin as buyers in Chicago and Group Three retreated to the sidelines to wait out the rally sparked by the U.N.'s decision to suspend the Iraqi oil-for-food exchange.</p>
<p>Group Three low sulphur diesel firmed to 3.0/3.25 cents a gallon over the print, with high sulphur 1.0 cent over.</p>
<p>Chicago low sulphur diesel made a similar upward move to 2.0/2.25 cents a gallon over the print, with high sulphur 0.50/0.75 cent a gallon over.</p>
<p>Group Three unleaded was talked 0.25/0.50 cent a gallon over the print with premium steady at 2.75 cents higher, traders said.</p>
<p>Chicago unleaded for September deliveries was heard done 1.10 cents a gallon over the print, with premium 3.50 cents higher, traders said.</p>
<p>Jet/kero barrels was bid 4.25 cents over the print in Chicago and 2.75 cents over in Group Three.</p>
