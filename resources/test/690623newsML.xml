<p>OPEC Secretary General Rilwanu Lukman said on Thursday that some members had been producing above their OPEC quotas but the group was confident efforts would be made to rein in excess supply.  </p>
<p>"It has been admitted generally that there are departures from the agreed level of output and supply. There is a general understanding that there is deviation," Lukman said at a news conference.</p>
<p>"We are confident efforts will be made to rein in overproduction," he added.  </p>
<p>Lukman said he expects to see an impact on OPEC's supply to the market "fairly soon".</p>
<p>He said the agreement, which everyone had signed up to, would take effect from July 1.</p>
<p>The group today formally confirmed its decision to freeze its 25.033 million barrels per day output ceiling to the end of the year, with members vowing to adhere to their OPEC assigned allocations.</p>
