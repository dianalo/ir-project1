<p>Hong Kong stocks closed lower on Tuesday in cautious trading with investors concerned about possible curbs on local property prices, brokers said.</p>
<p>"Trading is quite boring with people taking a wait and see attitude," said Charles Cheung, executive director at J &amp; A Securities. "Sentiment is a bit cautious as the whole market is waiting for the government's measures to cool property prices."</p>
<p>The Hang Seng Index eased 87.45 points, or 0.61 percent, to finish at 14,307.15, slightly above the day's low of 14,284.34. Turnover was HK$14.07 billion versus HK$15.30 billion on Monday.</p>
<p>Individual funds had lowered their weighting on Hong Kong stocks ahead of the possible imposition of measures to curb rising property prices expected to be announced after Hong Kong reverts to China on July 1, brokers said.</p>
<p>"The Hong Kong market is likely to follow the overseas markets in the short term with the Hang Seng seen moving in a range of between 13,800 and 14,500," Cheung said.</p>
<p>Defensive stocks such as utilities attracted bargain hunters and talk that a merchant bank was planning of a basket warrant to be issued on the sector also boosted their prices, brokers said. Hongkong Electric rose HK$1.80 to HK$32.70.</p>
<p>Lennon Chan, executive director at Tai Fook Securities, said market talk suggested that mainland investors were behind the recent rise of utilities counters. HK&amp;China Gas added HK$0.65 to HK$15.50 and China Light was up HK$0.10 to HK$43.40.</p>
<p>Selective buying was seen on Great Eagle, which rose HK$0.65 to HK$25.60, and Johnson Electric, which jumped HK$1.10 to HK$21.20.</p>
<p>Other blue chips were generally easier with the fall led by property counters.</p>
<p>"Many people are still worried that a major adjustment may take place on property prices later," Chan said.</p>
<p>Henderson Land fell HK$1.75 to HK$64.50 and Sun Hung Kai Properties eased HK$1.25 to HK$87.00, although Cheung Kong edged HK$0.25 up to HK$74.00.</p>
<p>Red chips continued to rise after short-lived profit-taking in early trade. The Hang Seng red-chip index closed up 20.27 points, or 0.71 percent, at 2,887.59.</p>
<p>COSCO Pacific gained HK$0.40 to HK$11.90 but Shanghai Industrial eased HK$0.20 at HK$42.80.</p>
<p>June Hang Seng Index futures contracts dropped 165 points to close at 14,240, a 67 point disount to the spot index.</p>
