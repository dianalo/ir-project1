<p>Datum is on track to meet or beat third quarter earnings projections, a Hambrecht &amp; Quist analyst said in comments to his sales force Wednesday, seeking to dispel rumors the quarter could be shy of estimates.</p>
<p>Analyst Joe Noel said Datum, a supplier of miniature atomic clock equipment used to control the radio frequencies of personal communication services (PCS) wireless phones, is poised to benefit from ties to Lucent Technologies Inc.</p>
<p>Noel also said he expected Datum stock reaching his $50 target price within three months.  </p>
<p>Datum stock was up more than five points at 37-3/8 in mid-morning trading.</p>
<p>"There's a few rumors that the quarter is light," Noel said, referring to the current third quarter. "We don't think those rumors are true."</p>
<p>The Hambrecht analyst has projected that Datum will earn $0.35 per share on $34 million in revenues during the third quarter. The current consensus for the quarter is $0.34, according to First Call.</p>
<p>Noel believed both Motorola Inc and Lucent are accepting as many Datum products as the company can produce.</p>
<p>"Our concern is not, 'Are there enough orders?' but, 'Can they manufacture enough to satisfy the demand?'" he said.</p>
<p>He expected the Lucent's contract with Ameritech Corp, estimated by Noel to be valued at between $700 million to more than $1 billion over five years, will result in revenues for Datum from Lucent by the 1997 fourth quarter.</p>
<p>He noted that Datum is the exclusive supplier of atomic clocks to Lucent, which has no second source for the product.</p>
<p>The analyst is projecting earnings of $1.31 per share for 1997 as a whole on revenues of $130 million and 1998 earnings of $1.61 per share on revenues of $150 million.</p>
<p>"We are expecting an upside to those numbers," Noel told Reuters. "Those numbers are on the conservative side."</p>
<p>"We will not change (our projections). We will let the company beat them, but we have a high level of confidence in those numbers."</p>
