<p>The Stockholm bourse showed surprising strength in the summer calm on Tuesday, the OMX Index rising 0.37 percent to close at 2,538.62.</p>
<p>Turnover was relatively heavy at 3.5 billion crowns but brokers reported an absence of major client orders.</p>
<p>IT stocks were the most interesting as Ericsson and Nokia await rival Motorola's results, expected in the European night. Ericsson rose 3.5 crowns to 319.5 and Nokia jumped 12 crowns to 614.</p>
<p>"It appears there are many people who believe growth on Motorola's mobile side will be strong and that could benefit Ericsson and Nokia," one broker said.</p>
<p>Astra was the most heavily traded, with 630 million crowns of shares changing hands although there was little news to guide the share.</p>
<p>Volvo eased one crown to 212 despite a positive reception given to news it is seeking to take complete control over its truck making activities in the U.S.</p>
