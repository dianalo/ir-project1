<p>German Gunda Niemann and Ids Postma of the Netherlands enhanced their prospects of overall titles with victories at the world speed skating championships on Saturday.</p>
<p>Niemann won the women's 3,000 metres and came close to breaking speed skating's oldest record in leading a German sweep of the 1,500 metres.</p>
<p>The five-time Olympic medallist holds a 1.782-point overall lead over team mate Claudia Pechstein, silver medallist in the 3,000 metres and bronze winner at 1,500 metres.</p>
<p>Postma increased his margin over Japans Keiji Shirahata to 0.540 points with a win in the mens 1,500 metres.</p>
<p>"If I feel the same way tomorrow, I think I can win the competition," said Postma, silver medallist at last year's championships.</p>
<p>American K.C. Boutiette, who trailed Postma by 0.75 seconds, was third overall. A former roller blader, Boutiette took up speed skating three months before the 1994 Lillehammer Olympics where he finished out of the running but decided to devote himself to the sport.</p>
<p>"I think it's crazy to come second after three years of skating," Boutiette said.</p>
<p>Niemann clocked two minutes 0.51 seconds in the 1,500 metres, the second-fastest women's time ever recorded. Team mate Anni Friesinger finished 1.49 seconds behind.</p>
<p>East German Karin Kania-Enke, the only woman ever to break two minutes for 1,500 metres, set her record of 1:59.30 in 1986 at Alma Aty before the break-up of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Annamarie Thomas of the Netherlands was third in the overall standings after finishing fourth in the 1,500 metres and sixth in the 3,000.</p>
<p>The top 12 skaters compete in the men's 10,000 metres and women's 5,000 on Sunday to decide the overall titles.</p>
