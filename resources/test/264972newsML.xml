<p>NV Verenigd Bezit VNU said on Wednesday it had agreed to set up a joint venture in the Netherlands with Britain's Freepages Group Plc.  </p>
<p>The Dutch publisher said Freepages already operated a national toll-free classified telephone directory for consumers which was easily accessed by telephone via the Internet.</p>
<p>It said the two companies had agreed to set up a joint venture to introduce the same concept in the Netherlands and would jointly invest some 40 million guilders in the project over the next three years.</p>
<p>VNU said the joint venture would enable it to build up a strong position in interactive information services.</p>
<p>In time it would become a valuable addition to VNU's existing marketing information services, it added.</p>
