<p>The shares in Hungarian oil and gas company MOL Rt rose to a new record high of 2,075 forints in early trade on Monday before coming down to 2,000 forints.</p>
<p>Traders said the rise was an aftermath of last week's rally on the Budapest Stock Exchange rather than anything linked to more details of Hungary's energy price rise on January 1, 1997.</p>
<p>MOL shares opened at 1,970 forints, above Friday's close of 1,960. At 1133 GMT MOL shares traded at 2,005 forints.</p>
<p>"Today's price increase in early trade can be explained by the fact that last week's momentum continued to push the shares higher," a salesman said. "But at certain levels investors began to sell with the aim of profit-taking."</p>
<p>Hungary's Ministry of Trade and Tourism (IKIM) on Saturday announced the details of controversial January 1 price increases in the energy sector, in which Western utilities invested over $2 billion last year.</p>
<p>The IKIM decrees, published on Saturday, detail the new gas an energy prices, without elaborating on percentage changes for individual companies.</p>
<p>The government announced in November retail hikes of 24.5 percent for electricity and 18.8 percent for gas but did not define the margins which would be granted to individual energy producers and distributors.</p>
<p>MOL officials were not available to comment.</p>
