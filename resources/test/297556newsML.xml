<headline>GM, VW look close to deal - source.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1997-01-09</dateline>

<p>General Motors Corp and Volkswagen AG have been holding secret talks to solve their dispute over the U.S. carmaker's claims of industrial spying by its German rival, a legal source told Reuters on Thursday.</p>
<p>The source, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters there has been "real progress in settlement discussions" in the case over allegations that a former GM executive and his associates stole documents when they left to join VW in 1993.</p>
<p>The talks began in early January, the source said.  </p>
<p>Hans Wilhelm Gaeb, a vice president at GM's European headquarters Zurich, declined official comment on any talks between the two carmakers.</p>
<p>The source said a settlement deal could be announced as soon as Friday. A key part of the talks had been VW's agreement to retract statements made about GM and Opel and the carmakers' attempt to damage Germany as an industrial centre.</p>
<p>GM had also moderated its stance in the dispute.</p>
<p>GM and Opel have been at odds since Jose Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua and a group of former executives left GM and its German unit, Adam Opel AG, in March 1993 to join VW.</p>
<p>GM charged that Lopez, a 55-year-old Spaniard, took along thousands of secret GM documents that helped VW return to profitability and blunted GM's competitive edge.</p>
<p>Lopez quit VW in late November, shortly before criminal fraud charges were filed against him and three of his associates by German prosecutors.</p>
<p>Previous attempts to settle the lawsuit GM brought against VW in a Detroit federal court charging the carmaker with racketeering have failed, in part because VW refused to retract statements made by top company officials.</p>
