<p>New Zealand Labour Party leader Helen Clark said on Tuesday it was undesirable for the New Zealand dollar to keep on rising so fast.</p>
<p>"I have never been an advocate of a low dollar. I think that in the end a strong dollar is a good thing.</p>
<p>"But what has been difficult for exporters is the rapid rise in the dollar, and I don't think it's desirable that it keep rising so rapidly," she told Reuters Financial Television in an interview.  </p>
<p>Clark rejected a suggestion that the New Zealand dollar's easing in recent days was due to Labour's rise in opinion polls before Saturday's general election.</p>
<p>"What it reflects is that interest rates have come down, and when interest rates come down the dollar comes down, and every exporter in New Zealand will be pleased to see that," she said.</p>
<p>Polls suggest Labour, currently the main opposition party, may be in a position to lead a centre-left coalition after the election.</p>
