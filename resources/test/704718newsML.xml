<p>Argentina's small-business leaders on Thursday are expected to sign a draft agreement between the government and unions on labor law reform, even though big business has denounced the blueprint as useless.</p>
<p>President Carlos Menem is attempting to use the pact, known as the Act of Agreement, as a fresh starting point for building a consensus on liberalizing the country's labor laws and reducing its 17 percent-plus unemployment rate. He has given the unions and big business until the end of the week to work out a final compromise.  </p>
<p>But the Group of Eight big-business lobbies have expressed anger about the watered-down reforms contained in the Act of Agreement and the fact that it was signed behind their backs.</p>
<p>Leaders of small and midsized businesses are supporting the union stance, however. "The small and medium-sized business group is signing up to the Act of Agreement this afternoon, which means they are distancing themselves from the Group of Eight," a spokesman for the CGT labor federation said.  </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Chamber of Mercantile and Business and Activities confirmed that it and other small-business lobbies would sign the act with the CGT later Thursday.</p>
<p>Menem, the Peronist leader, has tried for most of the year to modernize Argentina's labor legislation, the legacy of his party's populist founder, Juan Peron. His urgency springs from the need to combat unemployment, currently 17.3 percent, ahead of key congressional elections in October. Labor reform is also a condition of International Monetary Fund loan facilities.  </p>
<p>The original reform plan envisaged taking control of pay talks away from labor federations and swapping redundancy payments for a system of unemployment insurance. It would have also forced union-controlled health-care programs to compete in an open market.</p>
<p>After the president's attempts at reform by decree were blocked by the courts and three-way talks with unions and business made no progress, Menem sought to bring a catalyst to the process by signing a separate deal with the unions. That blueprint, the Act of Agreement, weakened the proposals contained in the orginal plan.  </p>
<p>Afterwards, the head of the UIA industry lobby, Claudio Sebastiani, blasted the deal as "no use at all." In response, CGT leader Rodolfo Daer vowed to change "not a comma or an accent."</p>
<p>That is when Menem gave his aides until the end of the week to bash out a final agreement. Otherwise, he threatened to push the reforms contained in the Act of Agreement through Congress.</p>
<p>Sebastiani was quoted by one local news agency as saying that three-way talks between unions, business and government would take place on Friday. Those discussions would "set out where we agree and where we disagree."</p>
<p>But the CGT said it had no knowledge that such talks were scheduled.</p>
