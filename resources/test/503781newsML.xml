<headline>Boeing looks to offer maintenance service-WSJ.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-11</dateline>

<p>Boeing Co has started an effort to provide maintenance services for large airlines, as part of a bid to diversify, the Wall Street Journal said in Friday's electronic edition.</p>
<p>Boeing was pushing to provide different support operations which airline carriers were looking to outsource or shed, the newspaper said citing people familiar with the matter.</p>
<p>Lawrence Clarkson, president of Boeing Enterprises, the unit heading its diversification, was quoted in the paper as saying Boeing has "begun some discussions with several airlines in this area that could result either in an acquisition of their maintenance business or perhaps a joint venture."</p>
<p>According to others familiar with the matter, British Airways was considering a possible sale, the Journal said. It sold its engine-maintenance arm to General Electric in 1991, it said.</p>
<p>A British Airways spokesman was quoted as saying he was unaware of plans to sell the carrier's heavy-maintenance unit.</p>
<p>Boeing was not immediately available to comment.</p>
