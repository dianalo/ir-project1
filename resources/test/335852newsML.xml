<p>German government officials said on Monday they knew nothing of a report in the mass-circulation daily Bild saying they were concerned Russia's ailing president Boris Yeltsin might have Parkinson's Disease.</p>
<p>The report said symptoms such as facial rigidity, a slowing down of limb movements and uncontrolled mouth movements had increased over the last two years.</p>
<p>But chancellery officials who declined to be named said they had heard of nothing to back up the report.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who had heart bypass surgery late last year and is now recovering from a bout of pneumonia, has cancelled a visit to the Netherlands on doctors' advice.</p>
<p>He had been due to hold talks on February 4 with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok, who currently holds the rotating six-month presidency of the European Union. But a Kremlin spokesman said on Monday that doctors advised Yeltsin to refrain from air travel and to work at home.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's aides say he is following affairs of state and working on papers, including an address to both houses of the Russian parliament due to be delivered next month.</p>
