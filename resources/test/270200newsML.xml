<p>Deutsche Bank AG said on Friday it expected to pay about 200 million stg ($332.6 million) in compensation to those who had invested in three funds managed by subsidiaries of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell Asset Management.</p>
<p>"From today's perspective, we expect to pay about 200 million sterling or about 500 million marks," Deutsche Bank spokesman Hellmut Hartmann said in answer to Reuter enquiries.</p>
<p>Hartmann added, however, that it was to soon to say what the exact cost to the parent bank would be.  </p>
<p>Hartmann said the Morgan Grenfell Asset Management and U.K. regulators had agreed on the method of calculating compensation but "not on an exact number".</p>
<p>The charge, which stems from the suspension of three separate funds from trading in September due to irregularities with the investment, will be booked under extraordinary costs for the 1996 business year, Hartmann said.</p>
<p>But he stressed that the bank still expected to post a 1996 profit which would be comparable to the one posted last year.</p>
<p>Group net profit under International Accounting Standards rules rose to 2.1 billion marks in 1995 from 1.7 billion.</p>
