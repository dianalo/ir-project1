<p>Spain, which is stepping up efforts to win a place among the founding nations in Europe's single currency, said on Tuesday it would present a three-year plan for fiscal discipline in May to European governments.</p>
<p>As suggested by the stability and growth pact reached by the European Union in Dublin during last December's summit, Spain intends to present by May an economic plan that would include structural measures as well as convergence goals.</p>
<p>"These reforms should guarantee Spain won't only be a (founding) member of the European Union but that it will also be a stable member," Economy Secretary Cristobal Montoro told journalists.</p>
<p>"This plan will be ready in May," he said, adding that it would be presented before the final summit of the Dutch presidency in June.</p>
<p>Spain, which has made its participation in the forthcoming currency launch the cornerstone of its economic policy, is supporting the view that being part of the Union is a matter of economic data rather than of political interpretations.</p>
<p>And the new proposal is going exactly in that direction.</p>
<p>Montoro said Spain's public deficit, set to be reduced to three percent of gross domestic product this year from 4.4 percent in 1996, could be brought below two percent in the next three years, thanks to a tame outlook for inflation.</p>
<p>"We can stay beneath two percent (public deficit as a percentage of gross domestic product) in the next three years without raising taxes," Montoro said.</p>
<p>Inflation, expected to fall beneath and stay below two percent in the coming three years, and structural measures were both seen as vital to keeping expenditures under control.</p>
<p>In January, the inflation rate fell to 2.9 percent year-on-year from 3.2 percent in December.</p>
<p>With low inflation "it won't be necessary to freeze public servant wages or to reduce purchasing power of pensions (in order to control the public expenditures)," he said.</p>
<p>Last Friday Spain's government presented a full set of supply-side measures aimed at boosting growth and keeping inflation low.</p>
<p>Labour reform, which trade unions and employers are currently discussing, should also became a crucial part of the package in the coming month.</p>
<p>"But as (the talks) are in a crucial point the government prefers to wait," Montoro said.</p>
<p>The other reforms presented are deregulation measures.</p>
<p>"None of these are crash measures. The best thing for Spain it to make structural reforms," Montoro explained.</p>
<p>Aznar's goverment intends to liberalise the telecommunication and real estate sectors and to guarantee more competition. These steps should help keep service fees low.</p>
<p>High inflation in the service sector, currently at 3.5 percent, is often mentioned as proof of the need of an overhaul.</p>
<p>With the advent of the single currency, Spain will give up the tool of competitive devaluations and must find other ways to promote growth.</p>
<p>"We are taking structural measures as a way of ruling out competitive devaluations in the future," he said.</p>
<p>The new plan for compliance will end just as the term of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar is concluding, when it will be important to have sustained economic growth.</p>
<p>And "the creation of new jobs will be our success," he said.</p>
