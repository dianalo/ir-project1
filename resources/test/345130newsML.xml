<p>CALLS FOR HEALTH MINISTER TO DENOUNCE CARE OVERHAUL</p>
<p>The Australian Doctors' Fund has called on Federal Health minister Michael Wooldridge to denounce plans by private health insurers to overhaul patient care.</p>
<p>Executive director Stephen Milgate says it would result in health funds dictating medical treatment to patients and GP's paid incentives to ration treatment.</p>
<p>Private insurers want an end to all restrictions which prevent funds from entering into financial agreements with doctors and hospitals.  </p>
<p>The funds argue they can, on behalf of their members, act as informed and active buyers of health services.</p>
<p>The doctors' group says in the United States managed health care companies have made astonishing profits by rationing health care and creaming the profits.</p>
<p>Mr Milgate says the U-S system is evil, denying treatment to the sick.</p>

<p>ARSON SQUAD LOOKING FOR MOTORCYCLIST  </p>

<p>Police have added a motorcyclist to the list of people they want to interview about the fires.</p>
<p>They're looking for the driver of a green 125 cc Kawasaki motorbike, seen driving in One tree Hill Road at Tremont near where three people were trapped and killed by fire.</p>
<p>A police caravan will be open at The Basin until Sunday for people to come forward with any information.  </p>

<p>GOVERNMENT DEFENDS ACTION AGAINST VOYAGER VICTIM</p>
<p>The Federal Government has defended its High Court action against a man involved in the Voyager disaster by claiming it's trying to maintain consistency.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth is seeking leave to appeal against the extension of time granted to William McLean, who's currently facing the second Supreme Court trial of his compensation case.  </p>
<p>Federal Attorney General Darryl Williams says the Commonwealth is going to the High Court so it can maintain a consistant approach to Voyager compensation claims.</p>
<p>But Mr McLean's lawyer, James Taylor, is unconvinced.</p>

<p>INSECT-BASED DRUG RESEARCH</p>
<p>Australian Pharmaceutical company, Bio-Discovery Limited, is planning to take advantage of Australia's huge insect population to develop new drugs.  </p>
<p>The company is joining forces with other research institutions, including the CSIRO, to develop new drugs to fight diseases such as alzheimer's and diabetes.</p>
<p>The CSIRO's John Okeshott says Australia's an ideal place to experiment with insect-based drugs because it has more than 200-thousand species, the majority of which are unique to Australia.</p>

<p>SUPPORT FOR PRIVATELY-RUN PUBLIC HOSPITALS  </p>
<p>An international credit rating agency has given strong support to the expansion of privately-run public hospitals in Australia.</p>
<p>Standard and Poors has given an A-minus long-term credit rating to bonds, which will be issued to fund Victoria's Latrobe Regional Hospital.</p>
<p>The hospital will be privately built and run at East Morwell, with its public services being sold to the Victorian Government.</p>
<p>Standard and Poors says it regards the project as a landmark, in what's likely to be a key business growth area.  </p>
<p>However, it says the need to cut costs, and the chance of changes in Government health policy, are key risks to the Latrobe project.</p>
<p>The agency says the private company, L-R-H, will have to run the hospital more efficiently than the public sector, to make a profit.</p>

<p>PASQUARELLI WANTS FAIR-GO  </p>
<p>John Pasquarelli, the ex-senior advisor to the Independant Queensland MP, Pauline Hanson, has entered the Industrial Relations Commission in Melbourne, saying he wants a fair go from his former boss.</p>
<p>The MP's former staffer was dismissed in December, amid what he claims was a power struggle over management and policy direction.</p>
<p>The case is currently before the IRC to determine whether Mr Pasquarelli was unlawfully dismissed.</p>

<p>MANSFIELD'S MATHS DOES NOT ADD UP, ABC UNION MEETING TOLD</p>
<p>Meetings of ABC union members around Australia have voted on resolutions criticising sections of the Mansfield review into the future of the ABC.</p>
<p>Public Service Union members heard that regardless of the outcome of the review, the ABC continues to face a 12 per cent cut in funding, threatening programming and broadcasting.</p>
<p>Resolutions condemned recommendations of the review to contract out television production and for the ABC to abandon international broadcasting.</p>
