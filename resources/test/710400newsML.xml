<p>Singapore's daily Straits Times newspaper published on Tuesday comments on the possibility of devaluation by Philippine Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo.</p>
<p>On Monday the peso came under pressure after a story in the Sunday Times, the Sunday edition of the paper, said de Ocampo had said that the peso could devalue against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>But he was not quoted directly in Monday's article and the central bank was quick to knock down the article saying he had been misquoted.</p>
<p>The follow-up article in the Tuesday Straits Times, filed from Manila, contained the following three paragraphs:  </p>
<p>"Despite persistent denials by Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo, who was quoted in the report, The Sunday Times has him on record saying there might be 'some kind of devaluation...only if market forces move the exchange rate to a different level.'</p>
<p>"He said the extent of the devaluation hinged on 'what we do with other aspects of our economy and to what extent the Thai crisis will affect us.'</p>
<p>"'If there will be any moves toward a higher exchange rate between the peso and the dollar, it will likely be gradual and not dramatic, in which case there will be a balance of benefits,' he added."  </p>
