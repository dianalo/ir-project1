<p>Bombay sugar prices on Friday were steady in a narrow range, dealers said.</p>
<p>Local and retail demand remained sluggish but limited arrivals kept prices in check.</p>
<p>In the ready delivery sugar S-30 was quiet at 1,470/1,500 rupees per quintal and sugar M-30 at 1,500/1,530 rupees per quintal.</p>
<p>Arrivals of sugar from mills to the market remained scattered as local millers have already sold out their allotted quantity of sugar out of the free sale quota for July.</p>
<p>"Sugar mill delivery remained steady today but outstation demand particularly from the southern states remained low at the mill level," one broker said.</p>
<p>"Southern demand was higher on Thursday but now this demand eased out as some of the transporters are demanding higher freight for the southern state."</p>
<p>Sugar mill delivery was steady at 1,420/1,430 rupees per quintal for the S-30 variety and at 1,440/1,450 rupees per quintal for the M-30 variety.</p>
<p>The free sale quota for July is 750,000 tonnes against 800,000 tonnes last month while August quota is 750,000 tonnes.</p>
