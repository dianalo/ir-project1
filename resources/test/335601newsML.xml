<p>British aero-engine firm Rolls-Royce Plc said on Monday it had won a $500 million order for Trent 700 turbofans from Emirates Airlines to power its new fleet of Airbus A330-200 aircraft.</p>
<p>The airline ordered 16 A330s and took options on a further seven of the twin-engined wide-body aircraft from Airbus last year. Deliveries are due to begin in January 1999.</p>
<p>Rolls said the deal makes Emirates one of its biggest airline customers and follows an order by the Dubai-based carrier for its Trent 800 engines to power a fleet of seven longer-range Boeing 777 twinjets which it started flying last year.</p>
<p>The order was applauded by the British government which said it meant Rolls had now won more than a third of sales in the "big twins" market for engines to power Boeing 777 and Airbus A330 aircraft, against U.S. rivals General Electric and United Technologies unit Pratt &amp; Whitney.</p>
<p>"This is excellent news for Rolls-Royce and for many other British companies in the supply chain," Trade and Industry minister Ian Lang said in a statement.</p>
<p>"A contract of this size indicates very clearly that British industry -- and British engineering -- can compete with the world's best in an increasingly global market place."</p>
<p>"Eleven airlines...have already bought Trents, giving Rolls-Royce a market share of about 35 per cent," he said.</p>
