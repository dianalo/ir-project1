<p>The yen's fall to the level it was at before its surge in 1992 has corrected misalignments, and some of the depreciation of the Japanese currency may be reversed, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) says.</p>
<p>"Exchange rate movements have generally continued the trends evident since the summer of 1995. In real effective terms, the dollar is at the peak of its trading range observed since the start of the decade, while the yen has fallen back to its level before its upsurge in 1992," says an IMF paper due to be presented at a weekend meeting of APEC finance ministers.</p>
<p>"These exchange rate changes mainly correct earlier misalignments and are consistent with underlying fundamentals and relative cyclical positions.</p>
<p>"As cyclical positions become less divergent, some of the recent depreciation of the yen may be reversed," says the paper, a copy of which was acquired by Reuters on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Finance ministers of the 18 member economies of the Asia Pacific Economic (APEC) forum are due to gather in Cebu in the central Philippines for a two-day meeting beginning Saturday. IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus is to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>The IMF paper suggested the ministers should discuss current exchange levels and see if there was a need to consider exchange rate policies. "Do ministers view current levels as broadly in line with fundamentals?" it asked.</p>
<p>"In light of the significant effects of changes in the yen/dollar rate on the effective exchange rates of some Asian emerging economies, is there a need to consider exchange rates policies, with an aim of further increasing flexibility, especially for the countries that maintain close links to the U.S. dollar?" the IMF said.</p>
<p>The APEC ministers are to discuss ways to free capital flows in the region and measures to develop the capital and financial markets and encourage private investments in infrastructure.</p>
<p>APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and the United States.</p>
