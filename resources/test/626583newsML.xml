<p>Grupo Financiero Bancomer, Mexico's second-largest banking group, said its board had approved the formation of a executive committee with multiple decision-making responsibilities and a new vice-chairman.</p>
<p>"This committee will have the mission of working with the bank's administrative team, analysing diverse strategic themes and proposing lines of action on which the board will have to decide," Bancomer said in a statement.  </p>
<p>The new executive committee will be formed by Bancomer chairman Eugenio Garza Laguera, Eduardo Elizondo, Alberto Bailleres, Javier R. Bours, Juan Carlos Braniff, Jose Calderon, Jose Antonio Fernandez, Barbara Garza de Braniff, Alfonso Garza Valdes, Ricardo Guajardo Touche, Max Michell, Julio Serrano and Roberto Servitje.</p>
<p>Also, representatives of the Bank of Montreal, which has a stake in Bancomer, will be invited on the exective committee. Those representatives have yet to be named, the statement added.</p>
<p>Bancomer also approved the naming of Jose Antonio Fernandez, director general of Fomento Economico Mexicano SA (Femsa), as vice-chairman of Bancomer. Fernandez takes over from Eduardo Elizondo, who stepped down for health reasons, the statement said.</p>
<p>Garza Laguera, chairman of Femsa, suffered a heart attack in early April and has since been recovering.</p>
