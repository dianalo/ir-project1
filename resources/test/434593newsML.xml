<p>British Sikhs met government officials on Monday to press for the right to wear their holy turbans in industrial workplaces and leave off the hard protective hats they say are contrary to the Sikh religion.</p>
<p>The British Sikh Federation said Sikhs had been forced out of jobs because of a European Community directive, introduced in 1992, which obliged Britain to enforce the wearing of hard hats whenever there is a possibility of head injury.</p>
<p>But the group said their persistence was paying dividends.</p>
<p>"I think they (the British government) are starting to take action which they should have taken some years ago," Kashmir Singh, general secretary of the British Sikh Federation told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Sikh federation has campaigned for the last five years for the right to continue with their existing jobs whilst wearing holy turbans only.</p>
<p>It has already won the right not to wear hard hats on construction sites and Sikhs are exempted from the law requiring motorcycle riders to wear helmets.</p>
<p>After what Singh described as "quite a helpful meeting" with Britain's Health and Safety Executive, the government body agreed to produce a leaflet giving guidance to British employers about Sikh head protection.</p>
<p>"This is a useful step for employers," said Singh. "But our objective remains to extend existing construction exemption rights to cover non-construction workers as well."</p>
