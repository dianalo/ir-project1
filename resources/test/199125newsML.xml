<p>England team boss Glenn Hoddle</p>
<p>must envy his predecessor Terry Venables as the pair separately</p>
<p>plot a course for the 1998 World Cup in France.</p>
<p>Wheareas Hoddle must steer England past former champions</p>
<p>Italy or face a play-off against another European power,</p>
<p>Venables can look forward to a far less strenuous journey with</p>
<p>Australia.</p>
<p>The former England boss confirmed on Tuesday he had accepted</p>
<p>the job as Australian coach.</p>
<p>As the major power of the relatively weak Oceania</p>
<p>Conference, the "Socceroos" must beat the likes of</p>
<p>Tahiti, Solomon Islands and New Zealand in their qualifying zone</p>
<p>next year.</p>
<p>As group winners, they would then negotiate a final home and</p>
<p>away play-off against the fourth-ranked Asian nation.</p>
<p>From enduring one of the most arduous qualifying paths,</p>
<p>Australia have been handed one of the easiest after FIFA's</p>
<p>decision to increase the World Cup field from 24 to 32 teams.</p>
<p>"There'll be absolutely no excuses this time -- if we don't</p>
<p>qualify for France, it will be a disaster for the game here,"</p>
<p>Mike Cockerill, soccer writer with the Sydney Morning Herald</p>
<p>said.</p>
<p>"We are no longer a third world soccer power. On our day, we</p>
<p>are now capable of beating anyone in the world, and that wasn't</p>
<p>the case even five years ago."</p>
<p>"With Venables in charge, we shouldn't just be aiming at</p>
<p>qualifying either -- our minimum target should be a place in the</p>
<p>last 16."</p>
<p>Venables will gain his first insight into the local soccer</p>
<p>scene when Australia host a four-nation tournament in January</p>
<p>against Norway, South Korea and New Zealand.</p>
<p>In their last World Cup campaign, Australia had to win</p>
<p>the Oceania group and then beat Canada in a two-leg playoff.</p>
<p>That merely cleared the way for a meeting with a South American</p>
<p>opponent in</p>
<p>the final qualifying round.</p>
<p>In the event, Australia stretched the might of Argentina and</p>
<p>Diego Maradona before losing 2-1 on aggregate, ending a</p>
<p>qualifying campaign that criss-crossed the globe.</p>
<p>Australia's fortunes now rest with the likes of Aston Villa</p>
<p>goalkeeper Mark Bosnich and Lazio sweeper Paul Okon, the</p>
<p>highest-profile members of a new generation of players who have</p>
<p>raised the country's profile on the international stage.</p>
<p>Both were members of the Australia under-23 team who</p>
<p>finished fourth at the Barcelona Olympic Games four years ago,</p>
<p>and will be approaching their peak in 1998.</p>
<p>By keeping his base in London -- an arrangement that has</p>
<p>angered some local critics -- Venables is better placed to</p>
<p>assess the form of his key players than predecessor Eddie</p>
<p>Thomson, who quit last month to join Hiroshima in Japan's</p>
<p>J-League.</p>
<p>In all, there are 28 Australians contracted to English clubs</p>
<p>alone, with dozens more dotted around Europe and Asia.</p>
<p>Australia's World Cup campaign begins in earnest next June</p>
<p>when the Oceania qualifiers begin.</p>
<p>An away trip to Fiji or Tonga may lack the passion and</p>
<p>glamour of facing Italy in Milan or Rome but both Venables and</p>
<p>Hoddle will realise the ultimate prize remains the same.</p>
<p>With an emerging core of talented players and an easier</p>
<p>qualifying path, perhaps it's Venables, rather than Hoddle, who</p>
<p>will need to brush up on his French.</p>
