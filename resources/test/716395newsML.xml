<p>Minolta Co Ltd and Yamamura Glass Co Ltd said on Wednesday that they had agreed to set up a joint venture to produce and sell circuit boards used in computer hard disc drives this month.</p>
<p>The two said in a statement that they will set up the new company -- Myg Disc Co Ltd -- on a equal basis, and that it will be capitalised at 450 million yen.</p>
<p>The new company, to be based in Hyogo prefecture, western Japan, will start production this year and reach full production by next April.</p>
<p>The two firms said the reason behind the setting up of the unit is anticipated rapid growth in demand.</p>
<p>A Minolta spokesman told Reuters that initial production was targeted at 100,000 boards a month.</p>
