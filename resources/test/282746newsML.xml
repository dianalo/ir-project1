<p>Spain's six-month Treasury bill yields are set to start the new year with a record low, dealers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>They forecast that at the first auction for 1997 on Thursday, the bill's yield should decline to around 5.90/91 percent from the previous rate of 5.949 pct on December 18.</p>
<p>Market expectations of further reductions in the key money market rate should push yields a little down, boosting total demand.</p>
<p>"There are expectations of new cuts in the rates, and I think we could see them at the auction," said Carmen Hernansanz, economist at Merrill Lynch in Madrid.</p>
<p>The bills were trading on the grey market on Tuesday morning at around 5.88/5.90 percent.</p>
<p>"I expect something similar to the last auctions. The Treasury will sell a high percentage with very good demand, with a marginal yield at around the grey market rate," said Juan Antonio Mielgo, economist at Bank of America here.</p>
<p>On December 13 the Bank of Spain cut its key money market rate by 50 basis points to 6.25 percent, prompted by benign November inflation data.</p>
<p>November CPI was unchanged on the month for a 3.2 percent year-on-year rise versus 3.5 percent in October.</p>
