<title>AUSTRALIA: RTRS-BHP iron plant workers stay on strike.</title>

<p>Construction workers building a A$1.5 billion iron plant for The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd in Port Hedland, Western Australia, on Wednesday rejected a back to work order by a government arbitrator, a BHP spokesman said.</p>
<p>Over 600 workers walked off the job on January 2 over wage and benefit claims.</p>
<p>The workers, belonging to the metals workers, electrical workers and crane drivers' unions are seeking up to 38 percent in additional wages and A$500 a week living-away-from-home allowance to cover the cost of living in far north Western Australia.  </p>
<p>A recommendation by the Industrial Relations Commission to go back to work was rejected at a mass meeting on Wednesday, with workers electing to strike indefinitely, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>"We are obviously disappointed over the workers' decision to stay out," he said.</p>
<p>But because the workers are hired by an independent contractor to construct the plant, BHP was powerless to end the dispute, the spokesman said.  </p>
<p>The plant is being built to produce hot-briquetted iron pellets, which are used as high-grade substitutes for scrap metal in steelmaking.</p>
<p>It is still due to start up in about a year, the spokesman added.</p>
