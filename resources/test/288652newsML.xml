<p>Wall Street stocks powered higher Monday as growing optimism about the economy boosted the shares of economically-sensitive and technology companies.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EST, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 53.88 points at 6,597.97, surpassing its record closing high of 6,560.91 set on Dec. 27.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues beat declines 14-9 on active volume of 297 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The rally followed a gain of more than 100 points in the blue-chip Dow index last Friday.</p>
<p>The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite was up 5.87 points to 1,316.55. The American Stock Exchange index was up 0.81 at 573.26.</p>
<p>"Chemicals, computers and automobiles are all doing well," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. "The message from the stock market is perhaps the economy is stronger than anyone had bargained for."</p>
<p>The stock market gained ground, despite a lackluster bond market, where interest rates have recently crept up towards 6.75 percent.</p>
<p>The bellwether 30-year Treasury slipped 4/32, bumping up its  yield to 6.74 percent from 6.73 percent at Friday's close.</p>
<p>Bond market activity was held in check ahead of key reports on producer prices and the jobless rate later this week.</p>
<p>Analysts said stock mutual fund managers are awash in cash and are busy looking for buying opportunities because of inflows from annual retirement account contributions.</p>
<p>The top names in technology shares continued to pace the rally, with International Business Machines Corp. up 3-1/2 to 162-5/8 and Cisco Systems Inc. rising 7/8 to 66-1/2.</p>
<p>Intel Corp. gained 1-3/8 to 139-3/4 after Cowen &amp; Co. increased its 1996 and 1997 earnings estimates for the company and reiterated a strong buy rating on the shares.</p>
<p>General Motors Corp. rose 2 to 59-7/8 after Smith Barney upgraded its opinion of the shares.</p>
<p>Apple Computer Corp. sank 3-7/8 to 17-7/8 amid new evidence of troubles at the computer maker. Several brokerge houses dowgraded the shares following Apple's announcement late Friday that its fiscal first quarter operating loss would far exceed Wall Street estimates.</p>
<p>Toys R Us. fell 5 to 25-3/4. The company said disappointing sales for the holiday season would lead to weaker-than-expected 1996 earnings.</p>
