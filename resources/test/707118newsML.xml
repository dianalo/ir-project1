<p>Uganda's annual headline inflation rate for June fell to 10.1 percent from 11.8 percent in May because of decreases in the price of food, clothing and foot wear, government officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The underlying inflation rate fell from 1.8 percent in May to minus 2.1 percent in June, while the monthly inflation rate has been increasing since April when it was 10 percent.</p>
<p>Drought mainly in eastern areas has affected Uganda's monthly inflation, hampering production of grain and other food stuffs, officials in the ministry of Planning and Economic Development said.</p>
<p>Grain prices have risen to record levels with 1kg of beans selling at average 1,200 Ushs ($1.1) and 1kg of ground nuts at 2,000 Ushs ($1.8).</p>
<p>Food prices could ease in July at the start of the harvest, Trade and Industry department officials said.</p>
