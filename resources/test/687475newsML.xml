<p>Following are comments from economists after the national statistics institute INE said on Wednesday gross domestic product (GDP) rose 2.9 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 1997 versus a 2.6 percent rise in the last quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>GDP rose 0.9 percent in the first quarter over the previous quarter.</p>
<p>YOLANDA FERNANDEZ, ECONOMIST AT AFI</p>
<p>The upwards revision of the fourth quarter data as regards private consumption and investment should be highlighted...In general, the data is positive. Public consumption is falling at a rate of above one percent while investment is performing favourably and the fall in construction is a little less than we feared...GDP growth of three percent this year is achievable.</p>
<p>ECONOMIST AT CAPITAL MARKETS, MADRID</p>
<p>These GDP figures look especially good in the breakdown. There is well-balanced growth in private consumption, and also a bigger level of gross fixed capital formation, which should help to boost employment in the future...In sum, I think (growth) is balanced and sustainable.  </p>
<p>VALENTIN FERNANDEZ, ECONOMIST AT CREDIT LYONNAIS IN MADRID</p>
<p>"With these numbers one has to point out not only the favourable contribution by external demand. In addition, domestic consumption is showing signs of awakening. At the end we see that a fitter labour market, improved consumer confidence and lower interest rates are pushing people to spend more. Investment hasn't taken off yet. At the end we have a steady growth at three percent, which was the initial official forecast for all the year. Short term I do not think this should have an effect over the trend in the interest rates".</p>
<p>JAVIER REQUENA, DIRECTOR OF ANALYSIS AT BENITO Y MONJARDIN</p>
<p>"This a good number that doesn't raise fears of inflation tendencies that will only come about with internal demand of some three percent. The numbers are particularly good considering that in 1996, February had an extra day and Easter Week fell in April and not in March, as in this year.</p>
<p>Now I understand the Bank of Spain's caution in wanting to see how private consumption developed, while, at the moment, I don't see a reheating of the economy in these numbers. The numbers are very good and probably the official growth forecast of three percent at year-end will have to be revised upward."</p>
