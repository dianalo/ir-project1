<p>The European Union's monetary committee approved on Wednesday French and German economic convergence programmes to qualify for the European single currency, a monetary official said.</p>
<p>The two plans will now be forwarded to EU finance ministers for discussion at their next scheduled meeting on March 17.</p>
<p>"We've examined the plans; they will be sent to the ECOFIN Council," the source said.</p>
<p>Convergence plans are important to assess EU states' efforts to meet the tough budget deficit and debt criteria laid down in the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>But approval even at ministerial level does not in any way prejudge the chances of individual countries being selected to participate in the European currency, the euro, from the start in 1999.</p>
<p>This will happen in spring 1998 based on this year's economic performance.</p>
<p>France and Germany have recently submitted fresh convergence programmes for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). It is the second time the bloc's two largest economies have presented their plans jointly, a sign that neither government can conceive of monetary union without the other.</p>
<p>The new plans were requested by the European Commission, which judged the original ones -- along with those of Italy, Belgium and Portugal -- "outdated".</p>
<p>The revised plans mainly incorporate already announced budgetary measures for 1997 and economic forecasts for the following years, another national monetary source said earlier on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It is unclear how far they stretch, but the source admitted they may go beyond 1999 because of the need to assess national capitals' long-term commitment to sound finances as requested in the bloc's stability pact for the euro agreed last December in Dublin.</p>
<p>France is expecting to cut its budget deficit to 3.0 percent of gross domestic product in 1997 and 2.8 percent in 1998 from 4.0 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Germany is also determined to slash its deficit to 2.9 percent in 1997 from 3.9 percent in 1996. But confidence that the country, without which the single currency is simply not thinkable, will qualify in 1999 is waning even within the usually reserved Bundesbank.</p>
<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel also said on Wednesday that Germany must fight rising unemployment and boost growth to meet the targets, therefore admitting his country may not fulfil the requirements for EMU.</p>
<p>"If we are successful in getting unemployment down by the beginning of the summer, we can fulfill the criteria," he told reporters in Bonn after a meeting with Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima.</p>
<p>In February, the ministers gave their blessing to Belgium's revised plan for the period 1997-2000. Portugal and Italy are still expected to present theirs to the Commission.</p>
<p>The panel of senior treasury and central bank officials was also to continue work on a second European Exchange Rate Mechanism, known as ERM II, to link national currencies that fail to meet the single currency criteria or do not wish to take part in monetary union.</p>
<p>It was also expected to provide orientations on a system of fines to punish countries running excessive deficits after the single currency, the euro, has been introduced.</p>
<p>Other items on the agenda of the regular meeting of the monetary committee included technical characteristics of euro coins and the assessment of national central banks' legal statute.</p>
<p>The Maastricht treaty says that central banks must be independent from the political power, a requirement which is not met by all and most notably by the Bank of England.</p>
