<p>CANBERRA, Dec 12 (Reuter) _ Key Australian Independent Senator Brian Harradine said on Thursday he would not vote for the social security amendment bill in the upper house of parliament, the Senate, unless it were amended.</p>
<p>Asked on Australian Broadcasting Corp radio if the social security reforms would get through the Senate in their current form, Harradine said: "No, without substantial explanations on the record and without the one or two amendments."  </p>
<p>Harradine said he could not detail his amendments at this stage. There are two social security legislation amendment bills scheduled to be debated in the Senate today.</p>
<p>Contentious measures in the first bill include: the government wanting to impose new tests for unemployed people receiving benefits; restricting social security advances; and ending earnings credit.</p>
<p>Measures in the second bill, to be dealt with simultaneously with the previous bill, include: the government wanting to count retirement savings in means testing for social security beneficiaries aged between 55 and retirement age; and reducing social security for some single people in share accommodation.</p>
<p>The government needs the votes of Harradine and fellow Independent Mal Colston in the Senate to pass the legislation to which all other non-government parties are opposed.</p>
