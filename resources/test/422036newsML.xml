<p>Britain's biggest port operator, Associated British Ports Plc, saw its shares sink lower on Wednesday after reporting annual profits which failed to match market expectations.</p>
<p>Pretax profits for the year to December 31 rose 5.8 percent to 93.5 million pounds ($150.6 million) after taking a three million charge to cover the group's exit from a loss-making pipe-coating joint venture.</p>
<p>The charge had already been flagged earlier this year. The company, which operates 22 ports, had underlying pretax profit growth of 8.7 percent to 96.5 million pounds after stripping out the charge.</p>
<p>Turnover was 247.2 million versus 235.9 million in 1995 and the total dividend payout rose to 7.75 pence from 6.5 pence per share the previous year.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected profits of between 95 million and 100.3 million pounds and the London market was unimpressed. ABP shares had fallen 19.5 pence to 299 by mid-session.</p>
<p>"The results weren't desperately disappointing but (the shares) have had a good run and these numbers don't justify a further run-up," one market maker said.</p>
<p>ABP chairman Sir Keith Stuart said the group had made "further encouraging progress" and was poised to reap the benefits of an economic upturn at home and abroad.</p>
<p>"Our ports and transport business is well positioned to take advantage of continuing growth in the UK and world economies," he said.</p>
<p>The port and transport group's results were boosted by higher volumes of steel exports and timber imports. But their impact was partly offset by lower levels of steel and animal feed imports. Port-related property income also saw renewed growth in the second half.</p>
<p>The group plans to step up investments, expanding port facilities further.</p>
<p>Finance director Charles Orange said in an interview that more money would be invested in 1997, but that it was unlikely to match levels seen in 1996 when capital expenditure was 83 million pounds.</p>
<p>"We will see more (investment) in 1997 which will be another high-investment year. For 1998 onwards we do have some projects which are still in the planning stage but which have not yet been approved," he said.</p>
<p>Those included riverside projects at Immingham and Hull in north east England, he said.</p>
<p>Orange said there had been no impact on profits from sterling's recent strength, adding that its billing and payments were denominated in pounds and that any fall in exports would be counter-balanced by a rise in imports.</p>
<p>The group reiterated that the opposition Labour Party's plan to levy a windfall tax on privatised utilities if it won a national election due before late May was unlikely to catch ABP.</p>
<p>"We don't think we're liable. We are not a monopoly and we are not a utility, so we should not be included," Orange said.</p>
<p>Reports in the Financial Times newspaper recently suggested that ABP would be one of the companies targeted by the tax. ($ = 0.620 British Pounds)</p>
