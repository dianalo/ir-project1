<p>A consortium led by the United Overseas Bank group sent in the top bid of Singapore $508 million for a site in a government land tender on Wednesday, said a statement from the Urban Redevelopment Authority.  </p>
<p>The other members of the consortium were United Overseas Land, the property arm of the bank, and also Singapore Land Ltd.</p>
<p>The price worked out to be S$7,256.13 per sq metre for the 16,669 sq m site in Novena Junction in the central part of Singapore. The site is zoned for commercial development.</p>
<p>The bid was about 10 percent above market expectations, said Ng Yeow Tong, property analyst with GK Goh Securities.</p>
<p>"It looks like the UOB group or its chairman Wee Chow Yaw is bullish over the medium term prospects for the commercial market," he said.</p>
<p>The UOB tender was about 30 percent higher than the next bid sent in by the Hong Leong and City Developments Ltd consortium.</p>
<p>Another 6,525.08 sq m site at Rochor Road saw the highest bid at S$236.81 million from Hwang Chou-Shiuan.</p>
