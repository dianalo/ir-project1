<p>Shanghai copper futures ended up on Friday due to speculative buying of the key March 1997 contract in the afternoon, traders said.</p>
<p>The contract ended at 20,660 yuan ($2,489) per tonne, rising 230 yuan. It opened at 20,490, hitting an intra-day low of 20,470 and a high of 20,680.</p>
<p>December rose 120 to 20,120, January 210 to 20,420, February 200 to 20,630, April 170 to 20,650 and May 130 to 20,650.</p>
<p>Combined volume fell to 51,995 tonnes from 72,310.  </p>
<p>Copper opened higher and rose for most of the session.</p>
<p>Traders said few investors wanted to hold short positions at current levels on expectations of further rises.</p>
<p>"Technical charts indicate further rises and expectations of a mid-term rebound boosted long position holders," one trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said that the London Metal Exchange is still an important factor affecting Shanghai copper in the absence of domestic market-moving news.  </p>
<p>"Falling LME stockpiles encouraged long position holders in Shanghai despite heavy domestic spot copper pressure," a second trader said.</p>
<p>The spot copper price in Shanghai fell to 19,000 yuan from 20,000 during the past week.</p>
<p>Aluminium ended down. December fell 70 to 13,550 yuan per tonne, January 30 to 13,720.</p>
<p>Combined volume rose to 200 tonnes from 1,850.</p>
<p>($1=8.3018 yuan)</p>
