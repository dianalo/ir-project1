<p>The ACT Brumbies blew the Wellington Hurricanes off Athletic Park on Sunday and booked themselves a Super 12 home semi-final in Canberra.</p>
<p>Outplaying the home side in both the backs and forwards in front of a capacity 40,000 crowd, ACT won a brilliant game of rugby by 38-29.</p>
<p>ACT finished the competition in second position behind Auckland and the Hurricanes in the third and the teams will have a rematch next weekend but with ACT having home advantage.</p>
<p>In a whirlwind start, ACT, playing with a strong breeze stunned the Hurricanes with two tries in the first quarter of an hour.</p>
<p>George Gregan, the most effective player on the day, started the five-try spree after just five minutes, darting through a gap to complete a series of attacks.</p>
<p>Minutes later winger Joe Roff came into the backline from the wrong side to put fellow winger Mitch Hardy in.</p>
<p>A David Knox penalty put the Brumbies 15-0 up after as many minutes.</p>
<p>Two penalties from Jon Preston narrowed the gap but a try by flanker Owen Finegan from a brilliant backhand flip from Gregan put the Brumbies up 22-6 at halftime.</p>
<p>A try to Filo Tiatia in the first minute after the break set the Hurricanes on course to overhaull ACT and that was soon followed by a Preston penalty.</p>
<p>But then Roff then scored again and Preston replied with a penalty from half way.</p>
<p>Hardy's second try midway through the half was the best of the day as the Brumbries forwards drove up the centre and a quick hands transfer to the winger set up the try.</p>
<p>However, Wellington were not done. Christian Cullen, who had been well contained, scored a brilliant individual try beating opponents for pace.</p>
<p>And then with minutes to go Cullen scored a second try chasing a kick through to give Wellington a chance to snatch a last-minute victory.</p>
<p>But the ACT defence held.</p>
