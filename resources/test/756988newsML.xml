<p>The Jakarta stock exchange suspended small-sized PT Bank Papan Sejahtera in late trading on Friday after a sudden sharp rise, an exchange official said.</p>
<p>"The rise was too sharp and too fast. We are calling the bank. We will issue a statement (regarding the suspension) later today," the exchange official said.</p>
<p>Bank Papan was up 375 rupiah at 2,000 rupiah in thin trading, with only 179,500 shares traded before it was suspended at around 0730 GMT, the official said.  </p>
<p>Brokers praised the exchange's move, but said the exchange should get tougher and get into details such as finding out who was behind the sharp rise and their motives so as to prevent recurrences.</p>
<p>They said similar sharp rises had occurred frequently in the stocks of other small-sized firms recently.</p>
<p>Last week, the exchange temporarily suspended trading in shares of animal feed producer CP Prima.</p>
<p>In June, the exchange temporarily suspended footwear manufacturer Super Mitory, electronics firm Jeewon and finance firm Clipan, brokers said.</p>
