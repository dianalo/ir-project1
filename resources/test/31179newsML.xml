<title>UK: BSkyB to lead sector lower on tax proposal.</title>
<headline>BSkyB to lead sector lower on tax proposal.</headline>

<p>Shares in broadcasters are expected to weaken, with BSkyB shares indicated 8p lower at 562-1/2p in pre-market dealings, on a press report that the Labour Party was planning a new tax on broadcasters if it wins the forthcoming election.  </p>
<p>The Financial Times said the proposed tax under the opposition Labour Party could be as high as 14 percent of revenue.</p>
<p>The so-called "spectrum tax" on all broadcasters would most negatively affect BSkyB, analysts said. That's because the satellite broadcaster, still sustaining tax losses due to big expenses associated with establishing the venture, doesn't pay any taxes.</p>
<p>"It looks like the idea of the proposal is to level the playing field, so it would hurt BSkyB most," said UBS analyst Colin Tennant.  </p>
<p>Broadcasters like Carlton Communications, whose shares rose 4-1/2p to 480p, stand to gain under the proposal because they are currently paying more than 14 percent of revenues, analysts said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the sector, shares in Yorkshire-Tyne Tees were down 35p to 1180p, adding to yesterday's 27-1/2p drop after the broadcaster noted declining advertising revenues.</p>
<p>Shares in Scottish TV were down 7-1/2p to 697-1/2p. But United News &amp; Media shares climbed 2p to 706-1/2p.</p>
<p>"It's all very speculative and long-term and the Labour Party may not even win," said another analyst.  </p>
<p>"What people will have to decide is the degree of plausibility behind this proposal," a trader said.</p>
