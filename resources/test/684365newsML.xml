<p>Italy looks set to cut its deficit to three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997, meeting a key requirement for countries wishing to join the single European currency, Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco said.</p>
<p>A Treasury source added that state accounts from the first six months of the year were in line with a government target for a full year deficit/GDP ratio of 3.0 percent.</p>
<p>Italy's deficit/GDP ratio in 1996 was 6.7 percent.  </p>
<p>Earlier, industrialists group Confindustria predicted that Italy's deficit/GDP ratio would be somewhere between 3.2-3.6 percent this year unless interest rates fell.</p>
<p>But Visco said the economy was entering a virtuous circle, with inflation under control and output picking up.</p>
<p>"Things cannot fail but to improve," Visco said in a speech to an economic convention.</p>
<p>He added that the recent sharp fall in inflation should bring another fall in official interest rates.</p>
<p>"The fall in inflation has already brought two or three sharp reductions in interest rates and sooner or later other rate cuts should follow," he said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Italy has kept its official discount rate pegged at 6.75 percent since January despite continued falls in inflation and growing calls for monetary easing from the government, unions and industrialists.</p>
<p>Preliminary data for June showed inflation dipping to 1.4 percent year-on-year from 1.6 percent in May. -- Rome newsroom +396 6782501</p>
