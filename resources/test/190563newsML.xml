<p>South Korea's Kisan Co Ltd said on Thursday it had bought 10 billion won worth of convertible bonds issued and held by Jeewon Industrial Co.</p>
<p>But a statement from Kisan, an affiliate of Kia Motors Corp, denied rumours that the company had agreed to take over the communications equipment maker.</p>
<p>"Rumours of our takeover of Jeewon Industrial Co are untrue," the statement said.</p>
<p>Kisan, a general construction firm, said the bonds purchase was made on November 12.  </p>
<p>Each bond, which carries a coupon rate of one percent, can be converted into Jeewon common shares at a price of 23,190 won per share, the statement said.</p>
<p>The request for conversion can be made between November 11, 1995 and November 30, 1998.</p>
<p>Maturity of the bonds is set for December 31, 1998. The statement gave no further details.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Kisan shares closed down 190 won to 9,800, while Jeewon shares fell 1,700 won to 27,300.</p>
