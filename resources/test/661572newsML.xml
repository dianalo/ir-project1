<p>Phoning via the Internet is fast and costs a fraction of ordinary international calls, but the quality is still poor and must improve before people hang up their traditional handsets, industry experts said on Friday.</p>
<p>Delegates at the Asia Telecom conference in Singapore heard speakers predict an Internet revolution would overtake the world's giant telecommunications companies, forcing them to embrace the global computer network.</p>
<p>New equipment now makes it possible to use computers to dial any phone number in the world while paying for a local telephone call and bypassing the traditional pricing mechanism operated by the multi-national carriers.</p>
<p>Until recently, computers have only been able to speak to computers but a new generation of software now allows phones to connect up to the net. The software is widely available and relatively cheap.</p>
<p>Singapore's Creative Technology and Israel's VocalTec were both offering the software for under US$50 at this week's Asia Telecom exhibition.</p>
<p>The Internet is forcing the pace of telecommunications deregulation, forcing phone companies to cut prices and add new services.</p>
<p>But Internet voice technology is still in its infancy and the very high quality sound most customers expect from telephone calls is still not available, executives say.</p>
<p>"Right now Internet calls sound like a mobile phone call with a slight delay," said Howard Bubb, president and chief executive officer of computer-phone equipment-maker Dialogic Corp.</p>
<p>"It's similar to intercontinental calls via satellite used to sound a decade ago," he told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>The cost of international calls via the Internet averages a few cents, and can be 100 times cheaper than using the phone.</p>
<p>But phones use a high quality, continuous two-way signal allowing callers to hear each other simultaneously.</p>
<p>Computers communicate with one-way packets of data sent down a line. This is perfect for messages, but when it is translated into speech, the result is like a walkie-talkie with an echo, with only one person speaking at a time.</p>
<p>Bubb, whose company makes the telecommunication gateway hardware which translates the signal generated by a phone into the data used by computers, said Internet phone callers must be willing to sacrifice some quality.</p>
<p>"What is unclear is how much degradation of sound people are prepared to suffer," he said.</p>
<p>Colin Williams, the president and chief executive officer of the international arm of U.S. telephone giant WorldCom Inc, believes poor quality may hold back the development of Internet calling, at least for a while.</p>
<p>"There have been some recent studies suggesting that if you look five years forward into the next millennium, we may see the Internet carrying 15 percent of voice traffic. But it will be limited," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>"Of course we may see a technological breakthrough over time, but for a long while you will continue to see voice as a core service for (traditional) carriers," he said.</p>
<p>The problem could produce an interim, two-tiered pricing system for calls -- with prices determined not by distance, but by quality, Bubb said.</p>
<p>"In the future, carriers may charge a low rate for low quality -- which is fine for computer messages but poor for voice. Higher rates would be charged for high quality," he said.</p>
