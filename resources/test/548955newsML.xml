<p>A privatisation offer of 350,000 shares or 10 percent in Development and Engineering Consultancy was oversubcribed and the state might sell all of its stake, one of the agents said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The state's Holding Company for Housing, Tourism and Cinema owns 25.4 percent of the partially privatised company.</p>
<p>"It is fully covered and I think we are going to sell the whole holding of the government," said Amr Hossny, managing director of brokers Triple A Securities.</p>
<p>"The price will be around 34.00 or 35.00 pounds," he told Reuters. The shares went on sale for two days last week and the minimum bid price was 32.92 pounds ($9.70).</p>
<p>Under the current system for privatisation offers, the highest bidders are allocated shares first, working downwards until no shares remain. Everyone pays the price bid for the last block of shares awarded.</p>
<p>$1 = 3.395 pounds</p>
