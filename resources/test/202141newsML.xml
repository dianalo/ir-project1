<p>The battle for Canada's Altamira Management Ltd. took a surprising twist on Wednesday when U.S. investment firm T.A. Associates Inc. launched a rival C$767 million ($572 million) bid for Canada's 12th-largest mutual fund company.</p>
<p>Boston-based T.A. Associates said it is offering C$38 ($28) per share for Altamira, which is also the target of a C$32 ($24) a share bid from Manufacturers Life Insurance Co. Ltd. of Toronto.</p>
<p>The competing offer came as two major Altamira shareholders prepared to go to court to block Manulife's C$660 million ($492 million) takeover bid for Altamira. The legal action was postponed on Wednesday after the feuding parties agreed to try to negotiate a settlement.</p>
<p>The shareholders, who together control 41.5 percent of Altamira, have said Manufacturers Life's offer is too low and that they were negotiating with another potential bidder.</p>
<p>T.A. Associates, which emerged as the mystery bidder Wednesday, is one of the largest private equity investors in the United States.</p>
<p>"We believe that our proposed transaction serves the purposes of all of the parties, and, more importantly, is in the long-term best interests of the unitholders of the Altamira funds," Andrews McLane, T.A. Associates' manager director, said in a letter to Altamira shareholders.</p>
<p>He said the offer was made on behalf of private equity partnerships managed by the Boston firm and other institutional investors.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the offer, Manulife would have to agree to release a group of employee shareholders from a promise to tender their shares to its offer.</p>
<p>Manulife already owns 30.5 percent of Altamira and has the support of a group of 40 Altamira fund managers and employees.</p>
<p>"We do not believe that this highly tentative proposal justifies any delay in implementation of the transaction we have agreed upon," Manulife said in a statement.</p>
<p>The bid is fiercely opposed by Montreal-based Almiria Capital Corp., which owns another 30.5 percent slice of Altamira, and a group led by Altamira Chairman Ron Meade.</p>
<p>The lawsuit launched by Almiria and the management group Tuesday was scheduled to proceed Wednesday in an Ontario court. But the court action was postponed after a last-minute accord by all parties to try to negotiate a settlement.</p>
<p>"The parties reached an agreement to proceed as quickly as possible to a final determination of the issues and all parties intend that Altamira will continue its business in the ordinary course," a joint statement said.</p>
<p>Manulife spokesperson Nancy Evans said there was no connection between the agreement and the appearance of T.A. Associates' rival offer for Altamira.</p>
<p>Altamira manages Canada's biggest no-load mutual fund with about C$6.2 billion ($4.6 billion) in mutual fund assets.</p>
<p>Manulife is the country's largest insurance company with about C$50 billion ($37 billion) in assets.</p>
