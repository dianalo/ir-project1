<p>KCBT hard red winter wheat futures ended lower but earlier losses were trimmed on a late rally tied to mill buying, traders said.</p>
<p>"We bounced off the midsession lows as it appeared there was a flurry of domestic flour business done," a trader said.</p>
<p>But traders also noted a bearish undertone tied to ideas U.S. wheat was overvalued relative to world wheat prices.</p>
<p>Tunisia bought 175,000 tonnes of soft wheat at $179.87 and 176.87 per tonne for October, November and December shipment at a tender Thursday. Traders noted the prices paid were below current U.S. futures prices.</p>
<p>Traders said the business was encouraging but noted export business overall remained sluggish.</p>
<p>"Rallies are built on export business, not routine domestic business," one trader noted, referring to the brief mill buying rally.</p>
<p>Prudential Securities was said to be a seller of the December on the day while Smoot Grain reportedly was a buyer, traders said.</p>
<p>Wheat ended 1/4 to four cents per bushel lower with September down four at $4.54.</p>
