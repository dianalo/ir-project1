<p>Turkish Cypriot ultra-nationalist leader Mehmet Arslan at the weekend called on followers to enter the empty Greek Cypriot town of Varosha and lay claim to houses there.</p>
<p>He told a rally late on Saturday at the fence surrounding the abandoned town that a march would be held on March 2, finishing in a mass entry of Varosha.</p>
<p>"We do not believe any of the authorities will stop us...Anyone who likes any of the houses there should spray their name on it, that house will then be theirs," Arslan said.</p>
<p>"I wholeheartedly support this march," said Kenan Akin, the Turkish Cypriot "minister of agriculture and forests" who attended the meeting.</p>
<p>The island has been divided since 1974 when Turkish forces invaded after Greek Cypriots staged a coup backed by the military regime then ruling Greece. Negotiations to unite the two communities in federation have stalled.</p>
<p>Turkish Cypriot leader, Rauf Denktas, two weeks ago said people would not be settled in Varosha unless Greek Cypriots went ahead with plans to buy anti-aircraft missiles from Russia.</p>
<p>Denktas heads a breakaway state in the Turkish dominated north of the island, recognised only by Ankara.</p>
<p>Varosha, called Maras in Turkish Cypriot, was a seaside resort town before Turkey invaded northern Cyprus in 1974. Its Greek Cypriot population moved south but Turkish Cypriots who seized the area did not move into the town.</p>
<p>Tension between the two communities has risen with the decision to buy the missiles which was approved by parliament two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Four Greek Cypriot civilians and one Turkish soldier have been killed on the island in recent months. One Greek Cypriot was beaten to death by Turkish Cypriot ultra-nationalists after crossing into Turkish controlled territory.</p>
