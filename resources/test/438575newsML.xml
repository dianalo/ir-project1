<title>USA: Continental links with Virgin Atlantic.</title>
<headline>Continental links with Virgin Atlantic.</headline>

<p>Continental Airlines Inc said it agreed to link with Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd in a code-sharing marketing pact that will give Houston-based Continental access to London's Heathrow Airport.</p>
<p>Continental and Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic Airways have been harsh critics of the proposed alliance between British Airways Plc and AMR Corp's American Airlines.</p>
<p>Continental and Virgin said their new partnership will replace Virgin's exisiting alliance with Delta Air Lines Inc, which will end later this year.  </p>
<p>"Our new code share deal with Continental brings together two similar business philosophies based on quality of customer service and value for money.  Both carriers will continue to bring the benefits of real competition to consumers on both sides of the Atlantic," said Virgin Atlantic's Chairman, Richard Branson in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Continental and Virgin will exchange blocks of seats on all their Newark/New York-London routes. Each carrier will sell, market and price its seats independently in competition with the other, the airlines said in a joint statement.  </p>
<p>Under the proposed arrangement, which will be subject to governmental approvals and certain documentation, Continental said it will add two daily flights between Newark and London, bringing its daily number of Newark-London flights to four. In addition, Continental said it will purchase a block of seats for resale on Virgin Atlantic's daily flights between London and each of Boston, Washington-Dulles, Los Angeles, Miami, Orlando, and San Francisco, and between Manchester and Orlando.</p>
<p>Virgin Atlantic said it will add a second daily flight between London and Newark, in addition to its two daily flights from London to New York's Kennedy Airport.</p>
<p>Continental expects to add two DC10-30 aircraft to its Newark-London routes, and Virgin Atlantic expects to add an additional Boeing 747.</p>
