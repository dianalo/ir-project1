<p>A British-registered company was linked on Monday to supplying arms to the former Rwandan government before and after its genocide of some one million people in 1994.</p>
<p>Documents found by British reporters near the abandoned Hutu refugee camp in Goma, southern Zaire, appeared to show that the company helped to arrange shipments of mortars, rifles and heavy machinegun ammunition from third countries including Israel and Albania.</p>
<p>Much of the weaponry appeared to have come from former East European communist states, BBC and Times reporters said.</p>
<p>A United Nations arms embargo was imposed in May 1994 after soldiers of the Rwandan army and Hutu militia began slaughtering Tutsis. Some of the documents were dated between April and July 1994.</p>
<p>Britain's opposition Labour Party called on Monday for a government statement on the reports.</p>
<p>Labour spokesman Robin Cook accepted that the British government had strict export licence arrangements to stop weapons being taken out of Britain and exported.</p>
<p>"It appears what they can't control is what was happening here, which is a company registered in Britain, drawing its profits into Britain, providing the planes and acting as the middleman for somebody else selling the arms and taking them on to Zaire," Cook told BBC radio.</p>
<p>The company could not be contacted for comment.</p>
<p>Defence Secretary Michael Portillo said a "knee jerk reaction from the government would not be appropriate".</p>
<p>"You tell me no crime is alleged here and that implies to me that you are saying we need to look again at the rules," Portillo told BBC radio.</p>
<p>The documents were found on a bus which had been used by the former Rwandan army before it was routed by Zairean rebels last week. It detailed invoices, air bills and arms shipments and asked for payment of debts totalling $1.9 million.</p>
<p>Included was a letter said by British reporters to read: "We have supplied your ministry for more than five years...you will realise that we have gone out of our way to assist your ministry in times of need."</p>
