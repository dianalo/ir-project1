<p>The Thai cabinet is expected to resolve the fate of the controversial and delayed 100-billion- baht second Bangkok airport project at Nong Ngu Hao on February 11, a senior Thai government official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Deputy secretary general to the prime minister Poosana Premanoch told reporters the government was also very keen to ensure that details of its planned comprehensive budget cutting exercise to resolve current serious economic woes should be completed by the end of the first quarter of 1997.  </p>
<p>"On February 11, the cabinet will resolve this issue (Nong Ngu Hao). It will be good for the country if the project is to go on," he said without elaborating what kind of decision was expected to be made.</p>
<p>On planned solutions to the country's economic woes, Poosana said the government should detail all measures clearly within two months time to regain the confidence of foreign investors.</p>
<p>"The government has little time left. We have about two months to raise comprehensive details," he said.</p>
<p>Thailand has proposed to cut about 100 billion baht in infrastructure projects and budgeted items as a way to cut wasteful spending.</p>
<p>Thailand has been hit by sluggish exports, a widening current account deficit, an offshore attack on the baht which has sunk against the rising dollar, and a plunging stock market now at a 4-1/2-year low.  </p>
<p>The government decided in mid-January to have a serious re-think about the second airport project, which was delayed due to cost overruns. It commissioned the transport and communications ministry to do a study on its fate.</p>
<p>The second airport was due to have been completed by 2000 but has been delayed until 2002 or 2003.</p>
<p>The move upset several companies which had already been given some multi-million baht contracts to do earthworks for the project.</p>
<p>At the same time, the government said it planned to expand the existing Don Muang Bangkok international airport to enable it to accomodate expanding passenger traffic.</p>
