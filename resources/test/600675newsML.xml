<p>Japan is performing a delicate balancing act aimed at keeping the yen strong enough to fend off trade friction while ensuring the currency doesn't soar too high and dent the economy.</p>
<p>"They don't want trade friction to increase due to a rise in the current account surplus, but they don't want to hurt the economy either," said Peter Morgan, senior economist at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>The dollar on Tuesday fell more than three yen to 111.98 yen, bringing it down more than 12 percent from its 56-month peak of 127.47 yen hit on May 1.</p>
<p>The bulk of that slide followed a warning on May 8 by Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara -- Japan's "Mr Yen" -- that the yen could rise as high as 103 yen to the dollar.</p>
<p>Currency strategists saw that comment as reflecting Japanese fears that the weak yen would spark a fresh bout of trade friction with the United States by boosting Japan's contentious trade surplus with Washington and the world.</p>
<p>A mere four days later, as the dollar fell below 118 yen, Sakakibara and other officials changed their tune, predicting that the currency market was likely to "settle down soon".</p>
<p>By Friday, when the yen hovered between 115 and 116 yen to the dollar, officials hinted that the rise had gone far enough. On Tuesday, Sakakibara said the climb was "too fast" and said he sought steps to keep the surge from hurting the economy.</p>
<p>In case anyone missed the message, Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka on Wednesday -- with the dollar hovering around 114 yen -- called for currency stability and told legislators that "worries over excessive yen weakening have completely disappeared".</p>
<p>Japanese authorities appear loath to see the yen rally they helped to engineer gather steam, given fears that more gains would damage a recovery now finally getting firmer.</p>
<p>"They have some fear...because at a certain level, the Japanese economy will begin to falter," said Takashi Kiuchi, chief economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. "I think that point comes somewhere between 110-100 yen to the dollar."</p>
<p>He added: "When the exchange rate exceeded 115 yen and approached 110, that fuelled some concern that a further yen strengthening might be in the pipeline sooner rather than later. So when the dollar broke 115, finance officials stopped talking the yen up and now are expressing concern."</p>
<p>Just how damaging the yen's rise might be to a recovery which many had begun to believe is in fact more robust than first thought is difficult to gauge, given uncertainties about future currency levels and economic structural changes.</p>
<p>"It's not a simple equation of strong yen and fewer exports," said Andrew Shipley, an economist at Schroders Japan. "There are now both pluses and minuses to the strong yen."</p>
<p>Tokyo share prices had stood firm above the critical 20,000 level despite the yen's recent surge, a sign some analysts saw as reflecting a growing economic immunity to currency swings because of overseas production and import flexibility.</p>
<p>But on Wednesday, stock prices slumped, bringing the benchmark Nikkei average below 20,000 as investors sold off blue-chip exporters which had been seen as big beneficiaries of the yen's earlier weakness.</p>
<p>"The balance is rather delicate," said Long-Term Credit Bank's Kiuchi. "I am afraid they don't have decisive means to realise what they want to achieve," he added.</p>
<p>If the yen stabilises at current levels, that would shave growth this year somewhat, several economists said. "It's not horrible, but it's not beneficial to growth in 1997," said Robert Feldman at Salomon Brothers Asia.</p>
<p>Currency levels aside, sharp volatility is making it tough for businesses to plot strategies and craft investment plans, and hence could dampen growth, Feldman said.</p>
<p>One business leader on Tuesday vented his frustration at both the sharp currency swings and the official comments that helped to trigger them. "The pace (of the yen's rise) has been too fast," Jiro Ushio, chairman of the Japan Association of Corporate Executives, was quoted by Japanese media as saying.</p>
<p>"It would be better if those (officials) who are concerned with foreign exchange markets did not make comments calling for currencies to rise or fall," Ushio said.</p>
