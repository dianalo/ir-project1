<p>Father Aengus Finucane will step down as Chief Executive of the aid agency Concern at the end of April, the Chairperson of the agency, Tom Arnold, said on Thursday.</p>
<p>He said in a statement that Finucane, who has been Chief Executive since 1981, was retiring but would continue his association with the agency in a fundraising capacity.</p>
<p>"In his work with Concern over the past almost three decades, Fr. Aengus has shown a huge commitment to improving the life of the poorest people in developing countries.</p>
<p>"His capacity to express his great sense of practical humanity has been central to the very generous support which the Irish public has always shown Concern, Arnold said.</p>
<p>Finucane went to Africa as a Holy Ghost missionary in 1960 and was a founding member of the agency during the Biafra conflict in Nigeria in 1968.</p>
