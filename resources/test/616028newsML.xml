<p>State Agriculture Bank of Greece posted profits of 13.3 billion drachmas in 1996, down from 15.8 billion in 1995, its chairman Christos Papathanasiou told reporters.</p>
<p>Lower lending rates and higher operating costs were to be blamed for the decrease in profits, said Papathanasiou.</p>
<p>Lending rose 7.3 percent in 1996, deposits grew 10.3 percent and equity capital by 10.3 percent due to an increase in reserves, he added.</p>
<p>Agricultural Bank will set up a management firm to coordinate the activities of companies belonging to its group and expects to choose an advisor to assist it in restructuring its group in June, said Papathanasiou.</p>
