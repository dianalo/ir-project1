<p>Venezuelan university teachers said on Tuesday they would begin an indefinite strike on Wednesday, adding to growing labour strife that threatens to sink the government's inflation-fighting economic programme.</p>
<p>More than 40,000 teachers at 17 universities will walk-out on some half a million students over an average 125 percent promised pay claim the government calls exaggerated.</p>
<p>"The government has not complied with its legally mandated pay increase," University Professor Union President Jose Rafael Casal said.</p>
<p>The teachers' demands fan already heated wage talks between striking Venezuelan doctors and the government over a 300 percent pay increase that many view as a test of the government's will to stonewall union calls for higher wages.</p>
<p>"The arrangement that is finally settled with the doctors will set a precedent for wider public pay settlements," said Labour Minister Juan Nepomuceno Garrido in a television interview on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Doctors have so far rejected an across the board 25 percent public sector pay increase. A seven truce day truce in the strike, which authorities charge left 15 dead in unattended emergency wards, expires on Wednesday night. The strike began on Dec. 27.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Guillermo Andueza said "the (labor) situation is not generalized ... there is social peace."</p>
<p>But the strikes, which includes judges, illustrate the drama of a recession-battered middle class employed by, and increasingly dependent on, notoriously poor public services.</p>
<p>"The (doctor's) strike is the beginning of the struggle of the middle class," the more normally restrained El Nacional daily said in a recent editorial.</p>
<p>While improving macroeconomic indicators have dazzled Wall Street since Venezuela implemented a series of International Monetary Fund supported reforms last April, ministers acknowledge that over 100 percent inflation in 1996 has laid waste to real wages.</p>
<p>However, they also urge public sector workers to show wage restraint and tighten belts further to help bring inflation down to 25 percent this year.</p>
<p>"If we don't keep a firm hand, we'll loose the ground gained and everyone must understand this," President Rafael Caldera said in his traditional end-of-year message.</p>
<p>"The hydra-headed monster of inflation, of which we've cut off a head, could come back," he added.</p>
