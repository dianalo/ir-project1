<p>Tunisian airline Tunis Air reported on Wednesday its net profit jumped 76 percent in 1996 and announced plans to buy 19 aircraft over eight years in order to tackle increasing competition.</p>
<p>Post-tax profits for 1996 were 26.57 million dinars ($24.2 million), up from 15.1 million dinars in 1995, final results presented at the company's annual meeting showed.</p>
<p>"These are positive results, considering the extremely competitive environment with 90 foreign companies flying to Tunisia," a senior Tunis Air official told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>To cope with rising traffic and modernise its fleet, he said the company was planning to purchase 19 aircraft, nine of them in the next three years.</p>
<p>The airline has also held talks with European airlines about a possible strategic alliance, the official said.</p>
<p>"We want to integrate ourselves in an international carrier group. Tunis Air has started talks (for a strategic alliance) with its traditional ally Air France, with Lufthansa and Swissair and looks forward to talks with British Airways," he said.</p>
<p>The fleet modernisation plan envisages the airline replacing some of its ageing Boeing 727 and 737-200, but Tunis Air gave no hints about what it planned to buy.</p>
<p>"The plan to replace part of Tunis Air fleet has been approved. We are launching an ambitious programme to modernise our fleet by purchasing 19 aircraft during the next eight years, though this might be accelerated."</p>
<p>Tunis Air currently has seven Boeing 727-200s, four Boeing 737-200s, four Boeing 737-500s, eight Airbus A320-200s, and one Airbus A300B4-200.</p>
<p>"To face the increasing demand, we are leasing two additional aircraft for the summer season," the official said, citing expectations of a good tourist season and rival Air Liberte suspending its flights between Tunis and Paris, a major route for Tunis Air.</p>
<p>The company carried 2.69 million passengers in 1996, up 4.26 percent from 2.59 million passengers in 1995.</p>
<p>"Our earlier forecast for 1997 was a five percent growth for passengers traffic which is now booming and therefore we expect now a two-digit growth figure," the official said.</p>
<p>Nearly four million tourists, mainly from Europe, visited Tunisia in 1996. Tourism traffic represents two thirds of Tunis Air total traffic, mainly with Europe.</p>
<p>Seven million passengers travelled through Tunisia's six airports in 1996. Tunis Air's share was 55 percent of scheduled flights and 37 percent of charter traffic in 1996.</p>
<p>In addition to renewing its fleet and forging a strategic partnership, Tunis Air plans to reinforce its route network serving Western and Eastern Europe, to look at foreign partnership at its technical center and catering and to reduce costs.</p>
<p>"We have a programme to reinforce our network with the main sources for Tunisian tourism and trade exchanges which is the European Union. Rarely people know that we have flights to 24 French airports, to some 20 airports in Germany, and 20 in Italy," the official said.</p>
<p>"We also started scheduled flights with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland, Hungary. We intend to have flights starting next year with Russia, Ukraine, and later Romania."</p>
<p>He said the airline was also considering flights to Beirut and Dubai in the Middle East and eventually to Mali and Ivory Coast in Africa.</p>
