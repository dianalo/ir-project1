<p>Bombardier Inc on Tuesday denied a report that it will officially launch on October 21 the production of its CRJ-X, a stretch 70-seat version of its 50-seat Regional Jet</p>
<p>A report published on Saturday in the Montreal daily newspaper La Presse said Bombardier planned an official production launch of the CRJ-X on October 21 and that the start-up would be mentioned in a speech by Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien in Montreal the next day.</p>
<p>Bombardier said today the production start-up decision would not be made until late November at the earliest.  </p>
<p>"We always maintained that if we did go ahead with the program, we would announce it before the end of 1996. We have yet to go to the board of directors for approval, and that won't happen until the end of November," said Ahmed Galipeau, communications director for Bombardier Aerospace.</p>
<p>In early September, Bombardier approved the marketing of the CRJ-X, which means the company's sales team had been authorized to present potential customers with firm prices, specifications and delivery dates. But the company has not yet divulged how many orders it has received for the new airliner.  </p>
<p>Galipeau said Bombardier would announce the number of orders for the CRJ-X only if and when it officially launches the production startup of the airplane.</p>
