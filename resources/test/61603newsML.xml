<p>GPU Energy restored service to almost all 11,500 customers in northern New Jersey, whose power was interrupted by strong winds and heavy rain Tuesday evening, the company said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The stormy conditions snapped local distribution lines carrying power to those affected customers.</p>
<p>"It was the high winds that caused tree limbs to fall on the wires," said company spokesman Jim Kern, adding there was no damage to the region's high-voltage transmission lines.</p>
<p>This afternoon, only 51 of those customers were without service, he said.</p>
<p>GPU Energy provides electric service to 940,000 customers in New Jersey.</p>
