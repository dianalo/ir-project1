<p>Public trust that Europe's central bankers will be committed to stability is far more essential to the European currency union's success than facts and figures, Deutsche Bank AG chief executive Rolf Breuer said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Addressing both the problems which nations face in readying themselves for the start of currency union in 1999 and widespread public fears the future currency, the euro, might not be as stable as the mark has been, Breuer said credibility was the more important issue.</p>
<p>"The problem is the lack of credibility," Breuer told an international video conference, adding that the public is not convinced that Europe's central bankers will be as committed to stability as, for example, the Bundesbank has been.</p>
<p>Breuer was participating in Global 24, an international conference on European Monetary Union.</p>
<p>Success in implementing stability-oriented policies would be more critical than the initial facts and figures nations must present to enter the currency union, Breuer said.</p>
<p>"A lot depends on the personalities that comprise the future European central bank," Breuer said.</p>
