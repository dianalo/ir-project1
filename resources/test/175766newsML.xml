<p>South African stocks ended the week down for the fifth day runnning as early promising gains from better-than-expected reserves data evaporated in the glare of prevailing negative sentiment, dealers said Friday.</p>
<p>The market is suffering under a pall of gloom about exchange controls policy and the recent bout of weakness in the rand.</p>
<p>After a strong start dealers dumped baskets of shares in order to buy the futures contracts and prices came tumbling down. "The market was quite firm this morning, but the basket trades knocked things back," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The focus on local factors has seen the record-breaking run of Wall Street go ignored by local traders. Such a bullish spurt would normally have a knock-on effect in South Africa.</p>
<p>The all-share index ended at 6,793.5, down 9.4 points, as industrials slipped 22.6 points to 7,991.8. The all-share index has now shed nearly 200 points in a week.</p>
<p>The gold index fared no better than the industrials and lost 11.9 points to 1,681.1. A tottering bullion price was to blame, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The gold price is struggling to get above $378 an ounce and that is hitting the shares," one trader commented.</p>
