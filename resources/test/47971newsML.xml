<p>Domestic telecommunications giant Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT) has applied for patents in Japan for its electronic money system, NTT officials told a news conference on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The system, an improved experimental version of one unveiled by NTT last December, would store electronic cash on an IC (integrated circuit) card and allow transfer at shops or over a network like the Internet, the officials said.</p>
<p>The NTT system, refined with the aid of a Bank of Japan think-tank, calls for a separate institution to issue the electronic money and another body to register users.  </p>
<p>Hiroshi Yasuda, director of NTT Information and Communications Systems Laboratories, said it was not clear who would set up the issuing and user registration bodies, nor was there a set schedule for pilot tests of the system, although most technological barriers had been cleared.</p>
<p>He also said it was difficult to predict how long it would be before electronic money would be in widespread use, although perhaps that might happen by the year 2010.</p>
<p>"It depends on how acceptable it is to users," Yasuda said.  </p>
<p>Other experimental electronic cash systems include Mondex, the brainchild of Britain's National Westminster Bank Plc and Amsterdam-based DigiCash Inc's E-Cash.</p>
