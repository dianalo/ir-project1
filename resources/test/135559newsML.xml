<p>Shares in Finnish foodstuffs, animal feed and chemicals group Raision Tehtaat Oy rose sharply on Tuesday after it said it had bought a majority share in Swedish margarine maker  Carlshamn Mejeri Ab.</p>
<p>At 1110/0810 GMT, Raisio was up 7.50 markka or over two percent at 295.00 after earlier touching 299.00, up four percent, but volume was very thin at 6,500 shares.</p>
<p>"I don't think this price can hold because the stock has been under pressure recently," one broker said, adding that early buyers seemed to be domestic and news of the deal may encourage profit taking.</p>
