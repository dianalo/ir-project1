<p>China warned on Sunday that any attempt in the United Nations to condemn its human rights record was doomed to failure and accused Western nations of putting developing countries on trial.</p>
<p>A commentary issued by the official Xinhua news agency charged the West with politicising the issue of human rights at the U.N. Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva and said some countries were practising double standards.</p>
<p>China could retaliate, it said.</p>
<p>"If some developed countries choose to impose confrontation on us and continue name calling, we will have no alternative but keep company," the commentary threatened.</p>
<p>The angry attack came just after the U.N. body began its annual six-week meeting last week, and appeared intended to counter anticipated criticism of China's rights record.</p>
<p>The United States and European Union are expected to bring a resolution expressing concern over abuses in China, but this looks likely to be defeated for the seventh year in a row due to Third World support for China in the 61-member commission, diplomats have said.</p>
<p>China was singled out in the U.S. State Department's annual report on human rights for having effectively silenced dissent in 1996 through jailings, intimidation or exile.</p>
<p>Beijing dismisses those charges.</p>
<p>"Following the Cold War, Western powers turned the forum of the Commission on Human Rights into a place of confrontation between the North and the South," Xinhua said.</p>
<p>"Posing as human rights judges, they directly targeted the developing countries," it said.</p>
<p>"Over the past years, some Western countries, portraying (themselves as) human rights 'models' and 'judges,' have made every effort to attack developing countries with so-called human rights abuses while turning a blind eye to their own inglorious human rights record."</p>
<p>These developed nations had turned the commission into a court in which to put on trial developing countries, including China as one of their major targets, it said.</p>
<p>"History has proven that attempts by a few developed countries, which are playing power politics, to impose their human rights standards and values on the majority of the international community are doomed to failure," it said.</p>
<p>"A few developed countries have learned no lesson from their failures," the commentary said, referring to the resolution expected to be tabled against China during the current meeting.</p>
<p>China's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, Wu Jianmin, last week defended his country's record and said Beijing awaited a proposal on prison visits from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC).</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Swiss humanitarian agency, which has never had access to political prisoners in China, has confirmed that it was in talks with Beijing about a joint working party of experts' meeting soon to begin talks on ICRC visits to detainees.</p>
