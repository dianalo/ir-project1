<p>Northland Port Corp Ltd chief executive Terry Archer said on Friday that the company's marine engineering business, which accounts for about 40 percent of turnover, was feeling the effects of the high New Zealand dollar.</p>
<p>"The strength of the New Zealand dollar is giving us a few problems, which is impacting on our profitability a bit in marine engineering," Archer said in an interview.  </p>
<p>He said several of the marine engineering division's customers were U.S. based, many of them fishing companies who found themselves having less to spend on upgrades when they converted their U.S. dollars to New Zealand dollars.</p>
<p>Archer said the foreign exchange risk as manageable when the New Zealand dollar was at US$0.6500. The New Zealand dollar is currently trading at US$0.7089.</p>
<p>"It's starting to change the people's perception of New Zealand as a place to get work done," Archer said.</p>
<p>"Now they are stating to query it and say 'where does it stop?', and that has to be of concern."  </p>
<p>While the marine engineering business represented about 40 percent of turnover, that proportion was shrinking.</p>
<p>Northland Port will report its annual result for the year to September on November 22.</p>
