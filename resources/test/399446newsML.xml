<p>An Egyptian minister on Monday dismissed the Egyptian pound's recent appreciation against the dollar as a temporary aberration and predicted the rate would stabilise.</p>
<p>"We don't intend to let it (the pound) appreciate. It's going to stay stable," said Youssef Boutros-Ghali, minister of state for economic affairs in the prime minister's office.</p>
<p>Commenting on last week's slight appreciation of the pound, on the back of heavy foreign currency inflows into Egypt's capital markets, Boutros-Ghali told Reuters "There are bound to be hiccups from time to time."</p>
<p>This month, the pound has gained about half a piastre against the dollar, less than one quarter of a percent. That change is small by international standards but significant to those in the Cairo market, where pound-dollar rates have hardly changed for years. Bankers speculated the central bank bought surplus dollars, adding to Egypt's large foreign reserves. The process is opaque because secretive public-sector banks usually act as intermediaries between the central bank and the market, but foreign reserves were last reported at about $19 billion, enough for more than 14 months of imports. Asked if the central bank was buying, Boutros-Ghali said "I suspect so." He said he had not seen new foreign reserves data. Boutros-Ghali said M2 money supply grew in the period July-December 1996 at the equivalent of 11.2 percent a year, suggesting that monetary authorities were able to neutralise the effect of the large foreign currency inflows during that period.</p>
<p>In the previous half-year, M2 money supply had grown at the equivalent of 11.8 percent a year.</p>
