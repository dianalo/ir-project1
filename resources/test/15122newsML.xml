<p>Finland and Sweden have no joint plans regarding Europe's exchange rate mechanism (ERM) or Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), Finnish Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen said on Monday.</p>
<p>"Finland and Sweden have no joint plans," Lipponen told a news conference in response to a question about ERM and EMU.</p>
<p>He declined further comment.</p>
<p>Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson, who also attended the news conference, said Sweden would meet the convergence criteria for EMU but did not elaborate.</p>
<p>The news conference was held at the end of the five Nordic countries' prime ministers' one-day summer meeting in Helsinki.</p>
<p>Finland said its objective was to be among the first countries to join the third phase of the EMU, scheduled for start-up in 1999.</p>
<p>Sweden has voiced some reservations and a decision for or against EMU is expected by the ruling social democrats in the autumn of 1997.</p>
<p>Finland has said a decision whether to link the markka to the ERM would be made this autumn.</p>
<p>Sweden has not set a timetable for any possible ERM decision.</p>
