<p>Lithuania's leading private bank, Vilniaus Bank, said on Friday that its Q1 audited net profit was 10.49 million litas versus 5.04 million litas for the same period last year.  </p>
<p>Julius Niedvaras, the chairman of the bank, also told a news conference that according to Lithuanian accounting standards, the bank's net profit for the first three months of the year was around 15 million litas.</p>
<p>He added that the bank's assets grew in the first quarter of 1997 to 946.93 million litas from 914.65 million litas.</p>
<p>"The bank was planning a net profit for 1997 of around 40 million litas...we think that the figure could be higher," Niedvaras said.</p>
<p>He added that the bank was eyeing the possibility of expanding its banking and leasing operations into neighbouring and CIS countries.</p>
<p>"We have started to examine possibilities in neighbouring countries and are also looking further," he said.</p>
<p>"Our researchers are currently gathering information in the Baltic counrties, Ukraine, Russia, Kazakhstan, Belarus, Uzbekistan and Poland," he said, adding that the bank was planning no hasty moves.</p>
<p>Niedvaras also confirmed that Vilniaus Bank was considering buying a stake in the State Commercial Bank, which has been slated for privatisation.</p>
<p>"We have submitted a letter of intent to the government expressing our interest in participating in the privatisation of the State Commercial Bank," he said.</p>
<p>He added that the bank was examining the financial results of four to five other Lithuanian banks with the intention of acquiring a stake in at least one of them.</p>
