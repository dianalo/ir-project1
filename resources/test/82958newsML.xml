<p>Italian engineering and metalworkers went on strike on Friday to press demands for a new contract.</p>
<p>Negotiations for a renewal of contracts broke down earlier this month.</p>
<p>Unions representing some 1.5 million workers have demanded an overall wage rise of 10.1 percent over the next two years, while employers had offered between seven and nine percent.</p>
<p>The eight-hour stoppage is the sector's first nationwide strike over contracts since November 1990.</p>
<p>Leaders of Italy's large trade unions were due to address rallies of striking workers in the northern cities of Milan, Turin and Padua.</p>
