<p>Foreign investors are getting hungrier for Portuguese stocks and bonds. And with more privatisations to come and Portugal a candidate for monetary union, their appetite is unlikely to flag soon, analysts say.</p>
<p>According to the latest official figures, net portfolio investment -- investment less disinvestment -- surged over the first six months of the year to 640 billion escudos ($4.2 billion) from just 49.5 billion in the same 1995 period.</p>
<p>Although the big swing was exaggerated because early 1995 was a particularly poor time due to international currency turbulence, there had undoubtedly been some "re-rating" of Portugal by foreign players, analysts said.</p>
<p>Foreigners sunk a net 477 billion escudos into shares over the first six months of the year, against 321 billion in the whole of 1993 when the local market experienced a boom, rising some 70 percent and outperforming the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>With bond prices surging to record highs and the share market bubbling, analysts are confident that full-year figures will show 1996 to have been a bumper year.</p>
<p>"I am pretty optimistic about the share market because the range of (investment) choice is getting bigger all the time," said Mark Howard of Lloyds Bank Fund Managers in Portugal.</p>
<p>On the share market, interest has been fired by major privatisations, including a further chunk of Portugal Telecom and cement group Cimpor, both of which drew foreign buyers in droves.</p>
<p>In the pipeline for next year is a slice of state electricity concern EDP -- that will be Portugal's largest privatisation yet -- along with the state motorway operator Brisa and oil concern Petrogal.</p>
<p>On the bond market, prices have been swept ever higher by a wave of euphoria over Portugal's perceived chances, together with Spain, of joining the European Union's single currency at its launch in 1999.</p>
<p>Forecasts published by the European Commission on Wednesday showed Portugal on track to meet entry criteria in all but one of the tests for economic and monetary union (EMU).</p>
<p>"If they (Portugal) are really going into the single currency, then the market is going to fly," said economist Sally Wilkinson of London's UBS Philip and Drew.</p>
<p>But while the change in international sentiment on Portugal is significant, the country remains very much in the second division of any European investment league, analysts said.</p>
<p>It ranks as an emerging market on the all-important Morgan Stanley (MSI) series of stock indices, which managers of big international investment funds use as a guide to strategy.</p>
<p>Analysts say that as long as it is not included on the Morgan Stanley World Index or its European one, it will not attract those funds which are routinely allocated on a 'weightings' basis across the major markets.</p>
<p>But its European-style low inflation and low economic growth also mean it lacks that mix of risk and high return that can make other so-called emerging markets attractive.</p>
<p>"Until Portugal is part of EMU...or on the MSI, there is always going to be a limit to foreign participation (in its markets)," said one analyst.</p>
