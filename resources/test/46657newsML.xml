<p>Local politician Lynne Plaskett says space aliens cured her cancer.</p>
<p>Plaskett, who is seeking reelection to the Volusia County council, appears on the "Maury Povich" television show this week with several other people who claim they were abducted or visited by aliens. She also recounted her 1975 close encounter with extraterrestials in Wednesday's Orlando Sentinel.</p>
<p>Plaskett, 46, who was diagnosed with T-cell lymphoma, says one night her room was filled with fog, she was levitated from her bed and an 8-inch disk appeared in her room. The disk hovered over her body and then disappeared.</p>
<p>Soon after, she said, her cancer was cured. "It was almost as if it was examining me," she said. "I know it wasn't God. I know it wasn't of this Earth. It was alien in nature."</p>
<p>Plaskett said she was not concerned about losing votes in the November election after her constituents in the county east of Orlando hear her story.</p>
<p>Going public with her experience "is more important than my personal career as a politician," she told the Sentinel. "If this costs me my election I think that would be very sad."</p>
