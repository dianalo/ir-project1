<p>Australian Treasurer Peter Costello gave an informal briefing to Australian journalists in Washington on Tuesday after a meeting with U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Allan Greenspan. Some of the comments made at the briefing, reported in the Australian Financial Review newspaper on Wednesday, caused U.S. Treasuries to rally.</p>
<p>Costello said later he did not comment on other countries' policies and said the report from his comments was "fanciful."</p>
<p>The following is a transcript of a recording of the comments broadcast on Australian Broadcasting Corp radio.</p>
<p>Costello was asked about his expectations of a rise in U.S. official interest rates after his talks with Greenspan.</p>
<p>Costello replied:</p>
<p>"Well, I don't think there's any expectation at the moment that rates are going to rise.</p>
<p>"You know they had their meeting last Tuesday ... and you would have seen that there was intense speculation that there was going to be a rate rise, and of course there wasn't.</p>
<p>"He (Greenspan) indicated to me that he saw no threats to inflation down the track.</p>
<p>"The only point that you could see developing would be if wages grew strongly but for an economy which is running at virtually full employment you don't see a build up of wage pressures.</p>
<p>"So he indicated to me that there was no reason to expect a change on (the) current scene as he sees it but you know this is all subject to the caveat of course that things can blow up and when things do arise you take countervailing measures.</p>
<p>"And this accords with our own view too. He was very optimistic. He's got a conjunction of strong growth in the U.S., near full employment and the lowest inflation in 30 years."</p>
<p>Asked whether unchanged U.S. rates would improve allow scope for another cut in Australian official rates, Costello said:</p>
<p>"We don't set our monetary policy by reference to the U.S. We have a very open, transparent monetary policy."</p>
