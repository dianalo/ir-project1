<p>Argentine bonds erased slim losses and stood firm in late trading Monday, soothed by a partial recovery in U.S. Treasuries, dealers said.</p>
<p>"There was very little activity today, and all we saw were speculators tracking movements in the U.S. long bond yield," one trader said.</p>
<p>Argentina's FRB Brady bond due 2005 rose 1/4 to 94 while the dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 added $0.05 to 121.1.</p>
<p>"People are waiting to see what the U.S. Federal Reserve decides between tomorrow and Wednesday, although most analysts have ruled out an interest rate hike," another dealer said.</p>
<p>She said market players were basically "calm" but had moved to the sidelines ahead of the Fed meeting.</p>
