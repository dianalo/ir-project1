<p>Zimbabwe is negotiating with the European Union for a resumption of aid for its economic reforms after a two-year suspension, the European Commission Delegation to Harare said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The World Bank last week invited other Western donors to follow its lead in resuming balance of payments support withheld in 1995 after President Robert Mugabe's government failed to meet some budget targets.</p>
<p>"We have a plan to follow the World Bank and we are negotiating with the government," Jens Laerke, deputy head of the European Commission Delegation, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He declined to give details of the plan, saying these were yet to be decided.</p>
<p>However, a British High Commission official said Britain, one of the southern African country's major donors, had no commitment to follow the World Bank's lead. He declined further comment.</p>
<p>The World Bank said last Thursday it had approved the release of the second tranche of its second structural adjustment credit worth about $62.5 million.</p>
<p>Its deputy resident representative in Harare, Kapil Kapoor, told reporters that the bank, the International Monetary Fund and other Western donors would meet Zimbabwean officials in early 1998 to discuss support for a new reform programme expected to be launched later this year.</p>
<p>He said the bank reached its decision to resume aid after reviewing Zimbabwe's macroeconomic performance and its 18-month 1997/98 budget presented on July 24.</p>
<p>"The release of the second tranche had been delayed as a result of macroeconomic uncertainty caused by the fiscal situation. The bank is now of the opinion that good progress has been made in turning the fiscal situation around," he said.</p>
<p>In his budget statement, Finance Minister Herbert Murerwa announced an unexpected reduction in the government's spending deficit for the 1996/97 financial year ended June 30 to 7.1 percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>This not only met the goal but was lower, for the first time in seven years, than the government's target of 8.5 percent.</p>
<p>Prior to that, the government had consistently failed to meet its objective of whittling down its budget deficit -- one of the factors which led the World Bank and other donors to suspend balance of payments support.</p>
<p>Kapoor estimated the withheld aid at around $30 million.</p>
<p>"While other donors would need to conduct their own independent evaluation of recent macroeconomic developments, we feel this is probably an appropriate time for them to release their pending balance of payments support," he said.</p>
