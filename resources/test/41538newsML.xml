<p>The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) said relief workers found "starving people everywhere" when they delivered food to the besieged town of Tubmanburg in western Liberia on Monday.</p>
<p>A WFP statement said the aid workers found "devastating scenes" when they arrived at the jungle town where more than half of the 35,000 residents were suffering from extreme hunger.</p>
<p>"The situation is very bad," the statement quoted WFP food aid monitor Dipson Tulay as saying. "One old woman could not even make it to the distribution centre...She dropped to the ground and died before our own eyes."</p>
<p>Officials of the Rome-based WFP and other aid agencies took advantage of peace moves by rival factions in Liberia's conflict to enter Tubmanburg, which had been cut off by fighting and associated insecurity since February.</p>
<p>"The children were all malnourished, many have swollen hands, swollen feet and swollen bellies and you can count their ribs," Tulay said. "The people told us that for the past seven months they have been eating leaves, wild yams, palm nuts and palm cabbage from the jungle."</p>
<p>He said the residents told aid workers that people had been dying at the rate of 10 to 15 a day.</p>
<p>"There were starving people everywhere," Kordu Brown, a representative of the Liberian Christian relief organisation, who accompanied the WFP delivery, was quoted as saying. "Even as we speak, people are dying here."</p>
<p>The WFP said Monday's truck delivery consisted of corn, soya, beans, oil and sugar to feed malnourished children.</p>
<p>The agency said the mission to Tubmanburg would continue on Tuesday with the arrival of eight trucks carrying enough rations to feed 10,000 people for about two weeks.</p>
<p>Fighting round Tubmanburg pitted faction leader Alhaji Kromah's ULIMO-K faction against one-time allies in Roosevelt Johnson's ethnic Krahn ULIMO-J faction. The two groups signed a peace pact on Friday.</p>
<p>That and Kromah's handover of weapons on Saturday were the latest in a series of moves agreed by Liberia's rivals under pressure from West African leaders to end more than six years of civil war and disarm an estimated 60,000 fighters.</p>
<p>Charles Taylor, who launched the war in 1989 and commands the largest force, has promised to start disarming his men this month when he expects to demobilise about 3,000.</p>
<p>The war has killed well over 150,000 people in Liberia, which was founded by freed American slaves in 1847.</p>
