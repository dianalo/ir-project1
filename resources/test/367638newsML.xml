<p>Prime Minister John Major said on Monday Britain wanted to deepen its political and business ties with Latin America and work together to combat drugs trafficking, terrorism and international crime.</p>
<p>Major told a conference aimed at boosting investment and trade flows between Britain and Latin America: "Britain and Latin America need a modern relationship. A relationship that goes beyond bilateral trade and investment."</p>
<p>The conference is being attended by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori, Brazilian President Frenando Henrique Cardoso and Panamanian President Perez Balladares.</p>
<p>Major said cooperation on international peacekeeping duties already showed what could be done.</p>
<p>"We must also strengthen our joint efforts to combat drug trafficking, international crime and terrorism. We must work together to solve the world's environmental problems," he added.</p>
<p>Major said Britain would continue to push for freer world trade and for the European Union to give greater access to Latin American states. -- London Newsroom +44 171 542 7768</p>
