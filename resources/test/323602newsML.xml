<headline>Industrial Bancorp Inc Q4 net lower.</headline>
<dateline>BELLEVUE, Ohio 1997-01-22</dateline>

<p>Industrial Bancorp Inc said Wednesday its consolidated net income for the fourth quarter of 1996 amounted to $1.4 million compared to  $1.3 million earned during the fourth quarter of 1995.  Net income for the year ended December 31, 1996 amounted to $2.4 million compared to $4.2 million earned during 1995.</p>
<p>Earnings were lower in 1996 as a result of two events which affected income.  First, the FDIC levied a special assessment against institutions with SAIF-insured deposits which caused Industrial  Savings and Loan to record a pre-tax expense of $1.5 million.  It is  anticipated that, as a result of the special assessment, FDIC deposit insurance premiums for savings and loan associations will be reduced  in the future. Second, Industrial Savings and Loan recorded $1.2 million of expense for the $3.50 return of capital related to unallocated ESOP  shares.  Accounting for this transaction required both an expense on  the income statement and an offsetting increase to surplus.  As a  result, there was no change in total shareholders' equity related to  this transaction.</p>
<p>Earnings amounted to $.27 per share for the quarter and $.47 per  share for the year ended December 31, 1996 compared to $.25 per share for the quarter and $.42 per share for the five months ended  December 31, 1995.  The net interest margin was 4.32% for the year  ended December 31, 1996 compared to 4.04% for the year ended  December 31, 1995.</p>
<p>Total assets at December 31, 1996 were $326.6 million compared to $323.0 million reported one year earlier.  The return of capital in  May 1996, which amounted to $19.4 million, significantly reduced  asset growth for the year.</p>
