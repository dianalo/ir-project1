<p>The Philippine Senate ended its session on Thursday without passing a much-awaited tax reform bill.</p>
<p>The chamber expects to pass the measure in August when Congress resumes session on July 22.</p>
<p>Senate ways and means committee chairman Juan Ponce Enrile said the Palace should not expect the chamber to pass a tax measure in just a few weeks when the lower house took its time in deliberating on the issue,</p>
<p>"I will hold exhaustive deliberations on this measure. Nobody can give us a deadline," Enrile told reporters.</p>
<p>Enrile said he would overhaul the version of the lower house which gave too many exemptions.</p>
<p>The bill is the last of a package of major tax reforms since President Fidel Ramos took office in 1992.</p>
<p>The bill, which aims to generate 18 billion pesos a year, would expand the number of people who pay income tax and overhaul the corporate income tax structure.</p>
<p>Its passage is essential for the country to exit more than 30 years of supervision under the International Monetary Fund. -- Manila Newsroom (63 2) 841-8937 Fax 817-6267</p>
