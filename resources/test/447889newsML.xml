<p>Britain's opposition leader Tony Blair said his party had changed for good and there would be no return to the days of a much more left-wing "Old Labour."</p>
<p>In an interview with Sky Television, he said:</p>
<p>"There is a big amount for the Labour party to do in government, provided that it is New Labour, provided we're not going back to the past, that we're making clear our commitments on trade union law, on not raising the top rate and basic rate of income tax."</p>
<p>Asked if Labour had merely been more successful than the ruling Conservatives in suppressing internal divisions which would surface after it came to power, Blair replied.</p>
<p>"No. I think that nobody who looks at the Labour party today can say that it hasn't changed for good."</p>
<p>Surveys showed not only that many business people were not afraid of a Labour government but actively wanted one and saw Labour as the natural party of business.</p>
<p>Blair said Labour would put right what the Conservatives had done wrong in education and other areas. It would work to achieve an economy genuinely in tune with the demands of the 21st century.</p>
