<p>A German air force helicopter crash in June that killed 13 people, including youths being taken on a demonstration ride, was caused by pilot error, Defence Ministry officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A report by the ministry's air safety panel said the crash in Dortmund was caused by the pilot flying too low towards a forest. When he tried to climb, the helicoper scraped several trees before crashing.</p>
<p>The report ruled out technical failure as a cause of one of the worst accidents in Germany's armed forces since World war Two. There was only one survivor.</p>
<p>The helicopter was giving a demonstration ride to young people attending a European youth festival in Dortmund.</p>
<p>The investigator's report said the 37-year-old pilot was one of the best and most experienced in the air force, but that he had nevertheless made risky manoeuvres during the fatal flight, including flying in dangerous curves and below the prescribed height.</p>
<p>The dead included the two crew, a military nurse, four members of television camera teams and six young people attending the festival.</p>
