<p>British Telecommunications Plc confirmed on Saturday that its board was meeting this weekend to consider a possible strategic merger with MCI Communications Corp.</p>
<p>"The board is meeting over the weekend to consider an anticipated proposal from MCI," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He would not be drawn on where the BT board meeting was taking place but said only that BT chief executive Sir Peter Bonfield was not in the United States.</p>
<p>The spokesman said an announcement was anticipated before the opening of the London stock market on Monday.</p>
<p>Sources close to the talks said an announcement was not expected on Saturday.</p>
<p>Both BT and MCI have said there are no assurances that an agreement will be entered into or that any transaction will be consummated.</p>
<p>Analysts are speculating that BT could pay $40 a share for the 80 percent of MCI it does not own -- leaving it with a total bill of $22.1 billion.</p>
<p>The deal would create the world's second largest telecoms group by market capitalisation -- just ahead of U.S. giant AT&amp;T Corp but behind Japanese powerhouse NTT Data Corporation.</p>
