<p>EU transport officials, like a convoy of juggernauts grinding their way to the head of a mountain pass, are edging towards a deal with Switzerland to allow EU trucks onto Swiss roads.</p>
<p>A meeting of EU transport officials on Tuesday confirmed May 29 as the date of an extraordinary meeting of EU transport ministers, raising the prospect of a deal in long-running transit talks with the Swiss.</p>
<p>Confirmation came after the European Commission, which leads the EU side in talks, presented national officials with the latest compromise proposal from Berne.</p>
<p>"We believe that on the basis of that plan there is room for negotiation. We said to the Swiss that it did not go far enough and they know that," a Commission spokeswoman told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Berne's offer has three elements, a pricing regime for heavy trucks using Swiss roads, an annual limit on the number of EU lorries allowed into Switzerland and a safeguard clause allowing both sides to alter the deal in "special circumstances".</p>
<p>The proposal on prices suggests a sliding scale of charges for all trucks on Swiss roads, hitting the dirtiest ones for up to a maximum of 515 Swiss francs ($365) and based on a weighted average of 460 Swiss francs per truck within the agreed quota.</p>
<p>Environmental classifications would use the EU's existing "Euro 1" and "Euro 2" environmental rankings for trucks, with the dirtiest category being for those trucks outside the system.</p>
<p>From the plan's introduction in 2001 the weighted average would remain constant, meaning that as dirtier trucks were withdrawn from the EU fleet, charges would rise for the cleanest category of truck to encourage the introduction of further improvements in vehicle performance.</p>
<p>European Union member states want immediate access for their 40-tonne trucks from the start of any agreement, with Berne offering a quota of "fewer than 100,000" from the start, albeit with two-yearly increments, a Swiss diplomat told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The increase would be such as to allow for a quota of around 300,000 by 2003, which is two years before the general access of 40 tonne lorries to Swiss territory," he added.</p>
<p>The two sides also have to thrash out the details of a transitional charging system to cover the period from an agreement coming into force and 2001, when new charges kick in.</p>
<p>Any deal would come as a relief to France and Austria, who face increased traffic on their Alpine transit routes because of Switzerland's 28-tonne maximum limit on lorry weights.</p>
