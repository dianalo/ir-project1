<p>Russia's second city of St Petersburg plans to start distribution of a Eurobond at the end of this month or early in February, the official Itar-Tass news agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>St Petersburg mayor Vladimir Yakovlev told Tass the city would initially issue $100 million of bonds with a maturity running between two and five years.</p>
<p>This would be followed by another $300 million issue, and if they are successful the city would issue further Eurobonds in 1998, it quoted him as saying.</p>
<p>St Petersburg has mandated U.S. investment bank Salomon Bros to lead the Eurobond issue.</p>
<p>The city is still waiting for a credit rating from one of the international rating agencies.</p>
<p>Russia issued a heavily oversubscribed $1 billion five-year Eurobond last November, marking its first return to international capital markets since the 1917 revolution, in the biggest ever debut sovereign Eurobond.</p>
<p>But it is still unclear to what extent the federal government will authorise, guarantee or tax issues by other Russian borrowers.</p>
<p>St Petersburg regularly issues rouble municipal bonds, but officials believe international borrowing would be cheaper.</p>
<p>The cities of Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod, and the region of Sverdlovsk have also announced plans to issue Eurobonds.</p>
