<p>France welcomed on Saturday the entry of Finland's markka into the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) which it said would boost bilateral trade and was a positive sign ahead of the creation of the Euro single currency.</p>
<p>"This entry shows first and foremost the confidence which exists in the good prospects ahead for the Finnish economy," Finance Minister Jean Arthuis said in a press release.</p>
<p>The statement was made immediately after the decision to link the Finnish currency with the ERM was taken at a Brussels meeting of senior finance ministry and central bank officials from the 15 EU member states.</p>
<p>"France hails the remarkable conditions under which the Finnish economy overcame the serious crisis which it underwent at the start of the 1990's. The great stability of the markka demonstrates the credibility of the economic convergence process in which Finland engaged itself with determination and courage," Arthuis said.</p>
<p>He said the move showed increasing international commitment to monetary stability which France has long backed.</p>
<p>"French proposals which all the European Union member states now back...demonstrate the constant will to move towards better monetary stability in Europe," Arthuis said.</p>
<p>"The entry of the Finnish markka in the exchange mechanism appears extremely positive. It will facilitate the economic and commercial relations between our two countries and is a good sign ahead of the introduction of the Euro," Arthuis said.</p>
