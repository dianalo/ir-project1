<headline>Swiss stocks end at record high.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-07-08</dateline>

<p>Swiss shares jumped more than one percent to end above the psychologically important level of 6,000 points in the Swiss Market Index (SMI) for the first time.</p>
<p>"The market is likely to rise further as fresh liquidity is still flowing into the market," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Derivatives-linked purchases, the stronger dollar and a bright interest rate outlook supported stocks, traders said.</p>
<p>The SMI was up 65.6 points, or 1.1 percent, to 6,012.6. It hit an all-time high at 6,027.8. The broad Swiss Performance Index advanced 39.73 points, or 1.07 percent, to 6,012.6.</p>
<p>Bourse volume reached 3.77 billion Swiss francs.</p>
<p>Most-active Roche certificates, which broke through resistance at 14,000 francs on Monday, powered ahead 580 francs to end at 14,585.</p>
<p>Dealers said today's gains may partially stem from Merrill Lynch's upgrade of its rating on Roche to "buy" from "accumulate".</p>
<p>Shares of insurer Winterthur led winners in the SMI, adding 68 francs, or over five percent, to finish at 1,404. Renewed rumours that Winterthur and Credit Suisse would reinforce their ties helped the stock. The companies declined comment.</p>
<p>Novartis consolidated after the recent strong gains. The registered shares fell 10 francs to 2,479.</p>
<p>Credit Suisse Group gained 5.75 francs to 209.25. Dealers said old rumours some of the major banks may plan a cooperation were still in the market.</p>
<p>UBS bearers were up 11 francs to 1,740. Swiss Bank Corp, which saw massive gains on Monday, was up one franc to 430.</p>
<p>Alusuisse recovered from recent losses, rising 11 francs to 1,456 and Nestle gained 16 francs to end at 2,048.</p>
