<p>The last major parade of Northern Ireland's turbulent marching season looked set on Tuesday to pass off peacefully after Roman Catholic objectors gave a guarded welcome to a police ban on parts of the route.</p>
<p>Police said they would stop the Protestant Apprentice Boys marching through Belfast's Lower Ormeau Road and the villages of Bellaghy and Dunloy, meeting conditions laid down by Catholic residents of Londonderry for Saturday's main parade.</p>
<p>Donncha Mac Niallais, leader of Londonderry's Bogside Residents Group, said he expected the march by more than 10,000 members of the Order in Londonderry to be without incident.</p>
<p>"I would say we will not object to the main parade or the parade on the walls," he told the BBC. "I hope things will be okay. We are entering into this coming Saturday in a spirit of accommodation."</p>
<p>Part of the march is along the old walls of the city overlooking the Bogside area, where civil rights marches in 1969 erupted into a political and sectarian conflict that became known as "The Troubles."</p>
<p>Some 3,200 people have been killed since then in fighting between republicans seeking a united Ireland and "loyalists" who want to stay part of Britain.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland, torn by Catholic riots over a Protestant parade last month, had awaited word from the Bogside, a staunchly Catholic Irish nationalist area of Londonderry, that the police action would satisfy them.</p>
<p>They wanted so-called feeder parades, which join the main march from outlying villages and towns, banned from Catholic areas whose residents say they amount to sectarian intimidation.</p>
<p>This year's marching season exploded into violence on July 6 when police allowed the Protestant Orange Order to hold a march through the Catholic Garvaghy Road area of Portadown.</p>
<p>Riots erupted nightly, forcing Britain to reinforce its Northern Ireland army, but peace was restored when the Orange Order decided to scrap its most contentious parades on July 12 after police said they could not guarantee their safety.</p>
<p>Saturday's parade is of symbolic importance to Protestant activists. It commemorates a 1689 siege of Londonderry by a Catholic monarch which was thwarted when Apprentice Boys -- trainees -- slammed the gates of the city shut.</p>
<p>Last year the parade was postponed after another violent marching season. When it was finally permitted in October, a 200 metre (yard) stretch of the walk, directly above the low-cost housing estate, was sealed off to avoid giving offence.</p>
<p>The decision on feeder parades was announced on the eve of the first formal talks between Gerry Adams, president of the IRA's political wing, Sinn Fein, and Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary, Mo Mowlam, in Belfast.</p>
<p>Adams, whose Catholic-backed organisation wants an end to British rule of Northern Ireland, has campaigned for years to get Protestant parades banned or rerouted to avoid offending the minority population.</p>
<p>Mowlam and Adams will discuss arrangements for resumed multi-party peace talks, which Sinn Fein will be allowed to join if a July 20 truce by the Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas is deemed genuine by Mowlam and her security advisers.</p>
<p>The talks are under a cloud because the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), the main voice of the pro-British Protestant majority, wants the IRA to pledge that it will disarm and disband to prove that its truce is genuine.</p>
<p>But Britain and Ireland, which co-sponsor the talks, say that guerrillas should be allowed to disarm in stages as the talks progress. The UUP says this will effectively allow Sinn Fein to negotiate with a secret army at its back.</p>
