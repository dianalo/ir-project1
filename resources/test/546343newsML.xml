<p>More than 20 ethnic Uighurs face seven days in police custody after being detained in the Kazakh capital Almaty for protesting near the Chinese embassy, an Uighur organisation in exile said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Twenty-four people detained on Monday near the Chinese embassy have been given seven days detention for disturbing the peace," Yusupbek Mukhlisi, leader of the Almaty-based United Revolutionary Front of Eastern Turkestan, told Reuters.</p>
<p>A police official at a "special reception" centre in a secluded suburb in Almaty, a small prison fenced off with concrete and barbed wire, confirmed that a group of Uighurs was being held there.</p>
<p>"We are holding such people (Uighurs)," said the official, who declined to be named. There was no other official comment on the detentions.</p>
<p>Mukhlisi said his son Mukhiddin was  among those detained. He said about 30 demonstrators were initially arrested, but some had been released.</p>
<p>Monday's protest was against executions of Uighur separatists in neighbouring China's turbulent Xinjiang province. Chinese officials have said three Uighurs were executed last week.</p>
<p>Xinjiang, a remote region of desert and mountains in northwest China, is home to the Uighurs and other Turkic-speaking peoples.</p>
<p>Uighur separatist violence, fighting what they call Beijing's policy of "assimilation" with bombings and assassinations, has increased ethnic friction in recent years.</p>
<p>A demonstration by people demanding Xinjiang's independence last February in the town of Yining, near the border with Kazakhstan, turned into a full blown riot, killing nine people and injuring 198.</p>
<p>A Xinjiang official said on Monday Chinese paramilitary police had shot dead two people in the province last week when a mob of more than 100 tried to rescue convicted rioters from execution.</p>
<p>Kazakhs and Uighurs share a common religious, linguistic and nomadic heritage but the former Soviet republic is under pressure from China to clamp down on the activities of Uighur exile groups.</p>
<p>Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said last week that Kazakhstan had promised China during a meeting of their leaders in Moscow not to allow Uighur separatists to carry on their activities on Kazakh soil.</p>
<p>Last year, China toughened border controls with Kazakhstan and other Central Asian states to prevent smuggling of weapons and subversive materials.</p>
