<p>Irish Life Plc said on Wednesday that it was carefully examining a request to allow the Employer Labour Conference to become involved in a dispute between the company and its field sales force.</p>
<p>The request followed a meeting of staff in the chief office branch of the MSF union on Tuesday to consider the ongoing dispute.</p>
<p>The Manufacturing, Science, Finance Union (MSF) represents the majority of the sales force.</p>
<p>The meeting called on both sides to the dispute to allow the Employer Labour Conference to become involved in the issue and to make a binding decision which both sides would accept as a settlement of the matter.</p>
<p>"The company acknowledges it is intended as a constructive attempt to achieve a settlement to the dispute. The company expects to make a formal response to the request on Friday," Irish Life said in a statement.</p>
<p>The life assurance and investment company suspended most of its field sales force in February, after failing to solve a 15-month old dispute over new work practices. Further attempts to resolve the dispute have also failed.</p>
