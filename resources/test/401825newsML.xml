<headline>Jordanian shares falter on bank stock selling.</headline>

<p>Jordanian shares fell 0.18 percent on Tuesday in low volume hampered by poor institutional demand accompanied with selling pressure on two banks, brokers said.</p>
<p>The official Amman Financial Market (AFM) index shed 0.29 points to 156.56 points in low trade worth 422,115 dinars ($596,207 dinars).</p>
<p>Popular blue-chip stock which had posted modest price rises since Saturday on the back of sustained institutional demand saw gains eroded across the board.</p>
<p>Selling pressure on two banks, which were among the few stocks actively traded on Tuesday, helped sour sentiment and drag prices lower in thin trade.</p>
<p>Both Jordan Gulf Bank and Middle East Investment Bank sustained a similar 0.04 dinar drop to 0.85 dinars and 1.05 dinars respectively.</p>
<p>Jordan National Bank which relisted last week after merging with the Business Bank, also shed 0.01 dinars to 2.04 dinars in 44,028 dinars worth of trade.</p>
<p>Only Arab Bank, which was the busiest stock traded on Tuesday, rose a modest 0.5 dinars to 263 dinars in trade worth 84,060 dinars.</p>
<p>Overall only four shares rose on Tuesday and 29 fell, while another ten traded but closed unchanged.</p>
<p>The private Pearl Index of the 45 most-traded shares on the exchange shed 0.32 percent to 82.61 points, still 0.94 percent down from the start of the year.</p>
