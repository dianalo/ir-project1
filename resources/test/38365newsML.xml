<p>A forest fire raged in the foothills of Jerusalem on Friday, forcing the evacuation of three villages but causing no serious injuries, police said.</p>
<p>Flames whipped by high winds reached within 100 metres (yards) of the main Tel Aviv-Jerusalem highway.</p>
<p>A police spokesman said 11 people were treated for smoke inhalation and helicopters and planes dropped water on the blaze. Dozens of fire engines and ambulances were at the scene.</p>
<p>Police ordered the evacuation of the Jerusalem suburb of Mevasseret Zion and two agricultural villages, Kiryat Anavim and Beit Nakofa. The spokesman said several buildings in Kiryat Anavim, a kibbutz, were destroyed by the fire.</p>
<p>The blaze, whose cause police said was still unknown, erupted about eight km (five miles) west of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>A little more than a year ago, a fire devastated pine forests along the western approaches to the city.</p>
