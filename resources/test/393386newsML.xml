<p>White sugar futures mimicked the sudden swings in the New York market but managed to claw their way back from the lows in late afternoon activity, traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>New York's March raws contract, which expires in a week's time, slumped to a low of 10.95 cents/lb on a combination of speculative and trade selling.</p>
<p>London stirred into life and followed the downward trend but bargain-hunters soon dragged the nearby values higher into mid-range, traders said.</p>
<p>"It's stabilised somewhat but the whites didn't really take a battering," said one trader.</p>
<p>"There's not a lot of conviction in London one way or the other, the speed was so quick."</p>
<p>At 1730 GMT May was down $2.00 at $309.00 after moving in a range between $307.40 and $311.00. August was down $1.30 at $309.00.</p>
<p>But volume stayed on the light side at 638 lots, showing that the swings on the whites market were a reaction to New York. Earlier trading was dominated by trade house crosses on May.</p>
<p>Light selling of the May/May arbitrage was noted at around $68 and the differential quickly narrowed to $66.</p>
<p>Market sources said the origins of the sugar purchased by Iran in its recent buying tender were the European Union for the whites and Cuba for the raws.</p>
<p>Confirmation of the sellers is still awaited but a leading London trade house was believed to be the seller of the whites while two other houses were involved in the raws deal, they said.</p>
<p>The Paris market also followed the general trend and lost ground. May was down $2.00 at $309.00 and August down $1.60 at $309.00.</p>
<p>Volume was concentrated in May and totalled 488 lots.</p>
