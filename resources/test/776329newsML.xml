<p>Blacks were rejected twice as often as whites when they sought home-mortgage loans from banks or other financial institutions last year, an annual study on lending patterns issued on Monday showed.</p>
<p>Asian applicants had the lowest rejection rates for any group.</p>
<p>The findings were contained in a report released by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, summarizing activity at 9,300 institutions that comply with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).  </p>
<p>It was compiled from data submitted to member agencies of the examination council -- the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp, Office of Thrift Supervision, National Credit Union Administration and Federal Reserve System -- as well as the Housing and Urban Development Department.</p>
<p>The pattern of rejections was little changed from 1995. Last year, 48.8 percent of black applicants were turned down when they sought copnventional home purchase loans, compared with 24.1 percent of whites. In 1995, 40.5 percent of blacks and 20.6 percent of whites were rejected.  </p>
<p>Asian Americans were least likely to be rejected for a home mortgage loan. In 1996, 13.8 percent of Asian applicants were rejcted, compared with 12.5 percent denied loans in 1995.</p>
<p>For Hispanic applicants, the rejection rate in 1996 was 34.4 percent compared with 29.5 percent in 1995. Native American applicants were turned down in 50.2 percent of cases in 1996, up from 41.4 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Roughly 15 million loans and applications were included in the latest findings, up about one-third from 1995.</p>
<p>Poor credit or no credit history were the most frequently cited reasons for denying loan applications.  </p>
<p>The study said lending to lower-income households was up "somewhat more" than lending to higher-income households in 1996 and that, taken together, government-backed and conventional home purchase lending to all racial and ethnic groups increased from 1995.</p>
<p>Lending to borrowers who earned less than 80 percent of the median income in their region increased 13 percent in 1996 after contracting by 4.4 percent in 1995. Lending to wealthier households that earned 120 percent or more of the prevailing median income was up 12 percent last year after falling two percent in 1995.</p>
<p>Eugene Ludwig, Comptroller of the Currency, said in a statement there were some promising developments in the latest report.</p>
<p>"Many of the trends are positive, with lending to lower-income households up more than lending to higher-income households," Ludwig said, "However, some of the data show a need for more detailed analysis."</p>
