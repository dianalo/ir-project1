<p>France asked its European Union partners on Monday for a period of consultation with its National Assembly over the EU's budget stability pact for the single currency, an EU source told Reuters.</p>
<p>"They have asked for a period of reflection," the source said, adding that Prime Minister Lionel Jospin would have to inform the parliament over the details of the pact on June 19, after an EU summit in Amsterdam that was supposed to approve the pact.  </p>
<p>The French request threatened to anger some its closest EU partners, in particular Germany, which had hoped for a quick response to the pact which seeks to ensure spending discipline among countries inside monetary union.</p>
<p>French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn confirmed to a news conference later that the stability pact had not been agreed on Monday.</p>
<p>He said the new French government would need at least a week to consider the budget accord.</p>
