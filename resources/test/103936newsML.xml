<p>Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland was due to start a three-day official visit to Vietnam on Tuesday as part of her country's new push to do business and forge political ties in Asia.</p>
<p>Brundtland was due to arrive in Hanoi about 0900 GMT and was scheduled to meet President Le Duc Anh and Communist Party Secretary General Do Muoi on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The prime minister will sign several agreements on development assistance and open her country's new embassy premises in central Hanoi.</p>
<p>Norway normalised relations with Hanoi in 1971, four years before the Vietnam War ended. But until earlier this year, Oslo's interests here were handled by its embassy in Bangkok.</p>
<p>Relations between the two countries warmed last year after a visit by Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van Kiet to Oslo.</p>
<p>Oslo's ambassador to Hanoi, Jens Otterbech, told The Business Forum Weekly that the two visits and the opening of the embassy were "solid demonstrations of a determined will by both countries to increase contacts and activities in all sectors".</p>
<p>"This is part of a new focus on Asia," said Espen Svendsen, First Secretary at the embassy, who noted that Brundtland had visited Thailand just before coming to Hanoi and had visited Indonesia and China last year.</p>
<p>"Development, business and politics go hand in hand," he said. "Vietnam is the only country which scores high in all three categories."</p>
<p>Norway resumed development aid to Vietnam this year, granting some $3.0 million. Otterbech said Oslo would help Vietnam with its energy and fishery industries and with poverty alleviation, with a focus on improving living conditions for women and children.</p>
<p>Norway ranks 32nd among foreign investors in Vietnam, with $23 million earmarked for four projects. Bilateral trade between the two countries stands at around $20 million a year.</p>
<p>The prime minister returns to Oslo on Thursday.</p>
