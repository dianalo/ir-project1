<p>Germany's overall tax revenues will fall 18.0 billion marks short of target in 1997, the finance ministry said on Thursday in a long-awaited estimate of Bonn's latest budget dilemma as it struggles to qualify for the euro.</p>
<p>The ministry said the shortfall, which tears a huge hole in the budget during the year member states will be judged for qualifying for the European Union's economic and monetary union (EMU), was measured relative to the last estimate an expert commission made in November 1996.  </p>
<p>The expert commission estimating the revenues also said 1998 tax income would be 31.6 billion marks ($18.7 billion) lower than previously predicted for federal, state and local levels.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Theo Waigel has already suggested higher net borrowing and the sale of some government holdings in the telecoms giant Deutsche Telekom to raise more funds.</p>
<p>Waigel was meeting with the Bundesbank council in Frankfurt on Thursday to discuss revaluing the bank's gold reserves to increase the size of the annual profit the bank pays out to Bonn, government coalition sources told Reuters.</p>
<p>The ministry said the federal government's share of the total shortfall was 9.1 billion marks in 1997 and 14.6 billion marks in 1998. ($ = 1.693 German Marks)</p>
