<p>Trading in the Singapore rubber market struggled to a difficult close on Monday as weak consumer demand depressed market players, dealers said.</p>
<p>"It's too quiet for me to say anything. I've heard nothing from the big boys," a trader said, refering to the fact that no requests for offers were seen from major buyers like Goodyear or Bridgestone.</p>
<p>"It looks quite bad. There's just no strong demand seen in the market. There were no offers at all," another trader said.</p>
<p>News the Thai government was seeking 5,000 tonnes of RSS3 grade rubber was ignored by market players.  </p>
<p>Traders said most consumers were still waiting on the sidelines, betting that prices for items like SIR20 rubber would head lower.</p>
<p>They said prices of SIR20 rubber will likely slide to around 47-48 U.S. cents a kg from the current level of 49 cents.</p>
<p>At around 0945 GMT, May RSS3 was seen at 116.00-117.00 U.S. cents a kg from 117.50 cents.</p>
<p>July RSS1 was seen at 169.00-171.00 Singapore cents (US$1.17-$1.18) a kg from 171.50 cents. October/December TSR20 was seen at 114.00-116.00 U.S. cents a kg from 116.00 cents.</p>
