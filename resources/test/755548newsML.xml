<p>The U.S. economy picked up steam in June, according to economic reports released Friday, fueled by a jump in orders for big-ticket items such as cars and appliances.</p>
<p>Durable goods orders far surpassed most economists' forecasts, while a separate report on sales of existing homes showed the housing market, though off slightly, still keeping pace with its recent strong levels.</p>
<p>June durable goods orders jumped 2.3 percent, the strongest showing since a 3.4 percent gain in January.</p>
<p>Economists surveyed by Reuters had forecast a 1.4 percent rise in durables orders.</p>
<p>"The first half of the year ended on an upbeat note, setting the stage for a strong second half for the nation's manufacturing sector," said Ken Mayland, chief economist at KeyCorp. "The goods-producing side of the economy is really humming."</p>
<p>Many experts had underestimated orders for transportation-related equipment, which account for about 20 percent of total durable goods orders. The transportation goods component surged 7.5 percent last month, helping to boost the overall figure.</p>
<p>While the report reflected increased economic activity, the Treasury market quickly shook off any fears of an overheating economy. The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond dipped briefly after the durable goods report was released, but then rebounded to stand a touch higher. Its yield, which moves in the opposition direction of its price, was at 6.44 percent, unchanged from Thursday.</p>
<p>Non-defense capital goods orders, a more forward-looking measure of companies' expansion plans, were particularly impressive in June, said Tim O'Neill, chief economist at Harris Bank/Bank of Montreal.</p>
<p>Orders for capital goods, excluding defense-related equipment, jumped 5.4 percent in June. That compared with a 1.1 percent gain in May and a 1.7 percent decline in April.</p>
<p>"The non-defense capital goods orders are one important bellwether of the confidence of producers in the sustainability of growth in the economy," O'Neill said.</p>
<p>He projected third-quarter economic growth of between 3.0 percent and 3.5 percent, following more tepid expansion in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The existing home sales report offered somewhat mixed signals.</p>
<p>The National Association of Realtors said purchases of existing homes fell 2.6 percent to an annual rate of 4.14 million units as both housing prices and mortgage interest rates picked up.</p>
<p>Wall Street economists had projected a somewhat smaller decline, but a coinciding drop in home inventories suggested the housing market remains firm.</p>
<p>"Today's report is just a minor blip," said John Park, an economist at Sanwa Securities (USA) Co. "We should definitely start seeing the housing sector pick up steam in the third quarter."</p>
<p>According to the NAR report, home inventories declined to six months' worth of homes in June from May's 6.8 months, indicating strong demand.</p>
<p>The inventory levels were somewhat favorable, said Anthony Chan, chief economist at Banc One Investment Advisers of Columbus, Ohio. Chan noted that any number below six months tends to be associated with heightened activity in the months ahead.</p>
<p>"Moving forward, we may fall below six months," Chan said, adding that the seasonally adjusted annual rate could climb above a 4.20-million-unit level.</p>
<p>In addition, long-term interest rates moved lower in July, which should provide stimulus for housing purchases and mortgage refinancings in the near term, Park said.</p>
<p>NAR President Russell Booth said he expects the underlying housing market to remain stable in the immediate future.</p>
<p>"While there has been a slight tapering off, the market has remained strong, due to favorable economic conditions overall," Booth said.</p>
