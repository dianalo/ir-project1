<p>President Clinton on Thursday attacked his Republican rival Bob Dole's economic plan as risky and said it would sharply boost the government budget deficit and interest rates.</p>
<p>"This plan will explode the deficit," Clinton said in a speech accepting the Democratic Party's nomination for the presidency. "It will increase interest rates by two percent, according to their own estimates."</p>
<p>Dole has pledged to cut taxes by $548 billion over six years and balance the budget, but many analysts are skeptical he can do both.  </p>
<p>Clinton contrasted Dole's sweeping tax-cut plan with his own proposal for more modest tax reductions.</p>
<p>"Every tax cut I call for tonight is targeted, is responsible and it is paid for within my balanced budget plan," the president said. "My tax cuts will not undermine our economy. They will speed economic growth."</p>
