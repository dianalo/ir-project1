<p>High-flying Brazilian telephone holding Telebras SA fell further Friday on profit-taking and on news the company could see lower rates.</p>
<p>American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) in Telebras were off 11-1/2 to 124-1/2 in heavy trade. The ADRs were among the most active issues on the New York Stock Exchange and were also among its percentage-loss leaders.</p>
<p>Telebras, a darling of investors and a bellwether for Brazilian stocks, has fallen 45 points since July 10 and is up from a 12-month low of 69.  </p>
<p>Traders said the ADRs had been weighed by comments Thursday from the company's director of corporate users that Telebras would cut its rates in response to competition.</p>
<p>"It's just an excuse to sell," a trader said. "There are some people with huge profits in Telebras ... and they are just locking in those profits."</p>
<p>Brazilian shares also have been shaken this week by fears that the reformist government could devalue its currency. Those jitters spilled over into other Latin American markets.  </p>
<p>Traders said Brazilian ADRs also had been hurt by concerns that a financial scandal in the state of Alagoas could hamper congressional passage of economic reforms.</p>
<p>Sao Paulo's stock market skidded eight percent in early trade because of local selling, mostly from domestic mutual funds.</p>
<p>Hinting at a broader retreat from Brazilian markets, the Brazilian Equity Fund Inc fell 15/16 to 15-1/4. The Latin American Discovery Fund was off 1-5/16 to 18-3/16, and both were among percentage-loss leaders on the New York Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>The concerns over Brazil spread to other Latin American telecom ADRs. Telefonos de Mexico fell 1-1/2 to 50-3/8, Telefonica de Argentina dropped 1-3/16 to 35-3/8 and Venezuela's CANTV was off 1-3/8 to 41-4/16.</p>
<p>Despite the decline in Telebras, J.P. Morgan said it kept its outperform rating on the company. Investment houses Smith Barney and Morgan Stanley also called the drop an overreaction.  </p>
<p>"We believe that yesterday's news reporting that Telebras is taking steps to make extra tariff cuts is dubious and that the share sell-off ... this news prompted was unwarranted," Luiz Carvalho, Morgan Stanley's Latin American telecommunications analyst, wrote in a report.</p>
<p>Among other ADRs, Dutch shares Royal Dutch Petroleum Co fell 1-8/16 to 53-13/16 and Unilever NV was off 5-5/16 ahead of the expiration of options.</p>
<p>ADRs allow U.S. trade of foreign shares.</p>
