<p>The European Commission will discuss shortly with EU member states ways to reduce the risk of mad cow disease and to improve detection methods, a Commission spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>The spokesman was commenting after a report was released showing widespread shortcomings in dealing with the fatal brain wasting disease known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE).</p>
<p>"No country can say 'We are 100 percent free of BSE'," Commission agriculture spokesman Gerard Kiely said.</p>
<p>"Individual country reports will be discussed with member states in the next few days or weeks," he added.</p>
<p>The initial report, entitled "Risk factors and surveillance with regard to BSE in the Community", was presented last Wednesday to the EU's Standing Veterinary Committee but only officially released after copies were leaked to the media.</p>
<p>It urged strict EU-wide enforcement of a ban on infected meat and bone meal, believed to be the main cause of BSE, in cattle and sheep feed. A scientific conference on this issue is planned in June.</p>
<p>It also recommended closer monitoring of animal waste disposal and meat heat processing rules.</p>
<p>An EU-wide BSE surveillance network should be created, data on suspected cases distributed to all member states and standardised training to diagnose cases stepped up, it added.</p>
<p>The report was compiled after EU inspectors visited 13 member states between October and December 1996. Britain and Portugal were inspected separately as they already had BSE control and eradication programmes.</p>
<p>The report's findings reinforce British claims that BSE has been under-reported on the European continent and support demands by Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler for wider measures to eradicate BSE.</p>
<p>Fischler was angered last December when EU farm ministers rejected a proposal to ban from the human food chain offal from sheep, cattle and goats that can carry scrapie or BSE.</p>
<p>Scrapie, like BSE, is a brain wasting disease and has affected sheep for centuries.</p>
<p>Shortcomings identified in EU member states included:</p>
<p>- Reliability of official scrapie figures.</p>
<p>- Large variation in scrapie measures ranging from killing a herd to doing nothing.</p>
<p>- Unequal application of EU trade rules to prevent the spread of scrapie.</p>
<p>- Unequal implementation of animal waste disposal measures and heat processing of meat and bone meal to kill infection.</p>
<p>- Lack of officials trained in BSE detection, controls and cattle processing rules.</p>
<p>- Illegal presence of up to five percent meat and bone meal in animal feed.</p>
<p>- Cross-contamination of more than 10 percent between pig, poultry and cattle rations in feed mills.</p>
