<p>The Australian government's deal with the Democrats minority party over the number of medical doctors will cost the budget up to about A$50 million over four years, a spokeswoman for Health Minister Michael Wooldridge said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Earlier, Wooldridge and the Democrats announced an expected deal under which the government would boost training places for doctors in return for Democrat support for the bill.</p>
<p>The savings in the bill were far greater than the cost of the compromise: savings of A$106 million in 1997/98, rising to A$256 million in 1999/00.  </p>
<p>Measures whose Senate passage is doubtful are worth about a quarter of the budget's A$7.2 billion 1997/98 fiscal tightening.</p>
<p>At 0445 GMT (3.45 p.m.) the Senate had returned to debate on two social security bills containing doubtful measures worth A$336 to the 1997/98 budget.</p>
