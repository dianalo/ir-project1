<p>At least eight fishermen  were missing and feared dead on Wednesday after one of two boats they were in was found capsized off Brazil's southern coast, authorities said.</p>
<p>"They are still trying to find them but hope is running out that any survivors will be found," Police Commissioner Elton Shechterhuff of Porto Belo port, in Santa Catarina state, told Reuters.</p>
<p>A port official confirmed news reports that eight fishermen were missing since Sunday and one of their boats was found overturned in the Atlantic Ocean some 60 miles (100 km) from shore.</p>
<p>But Shechterhuff said 11 failed to return after setting out on Saturday, adding they may have been caught by a fierce storm that struck late that night and early on Sunday.</p>
<p>The port official declined to give further details.</p>
<p>The Brazilian navy and air force were called in and continued to search the area despite diminishing chances survivors will be found, Shechterhuff and news reports said.</p>
<p>TV Globo said rescuers found one boat overturned but Shechterhuff added that pieces of the second were found floating.</p>
