<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures remained lower late Thursday in sluggish trade, with the complex pressured by a soft physical market though prices were still holding technical support, industry sources said.</p>
<p>At 1400 EST, March was still down by 8.5 cents at $2.345 per million British thermal units, while April was 6.4 cents lower at $2.16. Others were off by 0.1 to 3.5 cents.</p>
<p>"Cash got crushed this morning. There's been a little scale down buying, but it's probably more short covering than anything else," said one Midwest trader, noting March was holding trendline support in the low-$2.30s.  </p>
<p>Traders said mostly-mild U.S. weather this week helped pressure the cash, particularly with eastern stocks 153 bcf or 23 percent over last year. They said pressure was mounting for storage operators to trim inventories, a factor that should make a rally difficult to sustain without some protracted cold.</p>
<p>In the cash, Gulf Coast prices skidded 10-15 cents Thursday to the mid-to-high $2.40s. Midcon pipes slipped a similar amount to the mid-to-high $2.30s. New York city gate gas held relatively steady in the low-$3 area, helped by forecasts for colder weather early next week.</p>
<p>Technical traders still pegged March resistance in the low-$2.50s and then in the $2.70 and $2.80 area. Trendline support was in the low-$2.30s and then at the November 5 low of $2.12.</p>
<p>NYMEX said 13,148 Hub contracts traded by 1340 EST.</p>
<p>NYMEX Alberta and Permian natgas were untraded at 1155 EST.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, March fell seven cents to $2.07, while April was still two cents lower at $1.91. The East/West spread narrowed by 1.5 cents to 27.5 cents (NYMEX premium).</p>
