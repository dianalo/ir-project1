<p>Most of Europe's leaders are steadfast in their view that a single European currency will happen on time but a few prominent authorities have voiced the idea of a delay, if only because of the enormity of the task.</p>
<p>But even the word "delay", when sitting adjacent to the word "EMU", gives financial markets a spooky feeling.</p>
<p>"With 480-ish business days to go, this is not long. One can't exclude the possibility of a short technical delay," said Graham Bishop, European financial affairs advisor for Salomon Brothers in London.</p>
<p>"The difficulty comes if any delay appears to be motivated by a failure of political will to push the thing through. Once you've lost that momentum you'd find it difficult to regain it," Bishop said.</p>
<p>British leaders have been saying for some time that EMU was unlikely to get going on the planned January 1, 1999 start date and British Channcellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke on Monday repeated this view.</p>
<p>But added to Clarke's voice were comments from the Bundesbank's vice president, Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, who said people should not simply assume EMU will begin on schedule.</p>
<p>"It would be dangerous to act as if the decision had already been made," Gaddum told Reuters over the weekend at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.</p>
<p>While markets can shrug off comments from British leaders because Britain remains so indecisive about EMU, it is far harder for them to ignore the Bundesbank, analysts said.</p>
<p>"That's a fairly strong signal," said Bronwyn Curtis, chief economist at Nomura International in London.</p>
<p>"One of the things that people really haven't taken on board is that German institutions generally have become rather nervous about trying to get this things done on time," Curtis said.</p>
<p>At stake are some hard-fought gains by peripheral European markets such as Italian, Spanish and Swedish bonds. Some even said French markets run the risk of losses since it is France which has made the most progress in its attempt to mimic the policies and currency movements of Germany.</p>
<p>The high yielders are the obvious place," Curtis said, referring to potential for price slippage in the bond markets of Italy, Spain and Sweden. "But maybe France is the key, it would disturb the markets and people would go back and buy deutschemarks and buy Bunds."</p>
<p>Bishop of Salmon Brothers, said that if EMU were to start unravelling altogether it would be something of a "pandora's box", but he was sceptical of a major attack on French markets and said times were different than during previous episodes of market turbulence over EMU.</p>
<p>Fundamentals now support the markets in France being valued similar to those in Germany. And countries that have been pursuing EMU-oriented policies would be unlikely to dump them just because of a delay to EMU.</p>
<p>"Can you automatically assume those governments which have adopted sound policies would adopt unsound policies? Why would they do that?," Bishop said.</p>
<p>"I can imagine a knee-jerk reaction (in the markets) as one thing. But where you would be a year later -- why would you be far aware from where you are today?"</p>
<p>Some said a purely technically inspired delay to EMU could be sold to the markets. If the investment community believed that this would allow a smoother, larger and more stable EMU group then, say, a six-month postponement could be achieved.</p>
<p>"If you say, Six months will give us a little more time to orchestrate a bigger EMU' then maybe six months doesnt make any big deal whatsoever," said George Magnus, chief international economist at UBS in London.</p>
<p>Regardless, markets are likely pay increasing attention to even the slightest whisper of the word delay from here on in, analysts said.</p>
<p>"The more publicity this gets, and the closer we get to the event as we travel through 1997, it was always going to be the case that the market would perk up its ears a bit," Magnus said.</p>
