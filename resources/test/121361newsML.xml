<p>The British government said on Wednesday it would work with business leaders to develop plans on how to cope with guerrilla bombings.</p>
<p>Experience gained after recent bombings by the Irish Republican Army in Manchester and London is to be used to guide businesses recovering from such attacks, David Maclean, a junior minister at the Home Office (interior ministry), said.</p>
<p>"It is vital that we all plan our reponse to a terrorist incident as to any other unexpected disaster," Maclean told a business conference in London.</p>
<p>"It is for businesses to carry out their own contingency planning. But the government's job is to provide all the help it can."</p>
<p>He said government representatives would work closely with a small planning team drawn from Manchester and London involving police, business and local authority representatives with direct personal experience of dealing with bombings.</p>
<p>The IRA ended an 18-month truce in a 25-year war against British rule in Northern Ireland in February when it detonated a bomb in London's east end Canary Wharf business district, killing two people and causing hundreds of millions of pounds in damage.</p>
<p>In June an IRA truck bomb devastated a shopping complex in the centre of the northern England city of Manchester, and the bill for that so far to British-based insurers has been nearly 200 million pounds (more than $300 million).</p>
<p>The Home Office has published two booklets on how to create and implement a business recovery plan following a bombing attack.</p>
<p>The booklets also offer guidance on how to liaise with emergency services following other disasters such as storms, floods, fires, action by pressure groups, product contamination or quality control failure.</p>
<p>"The government will do everything in its power to eliminate, prevent and counter terrorism. But it is also essential that business do everything in their power to have effective contingency plans in place," Maclean said. ($1=.6309 Pound)</p>
