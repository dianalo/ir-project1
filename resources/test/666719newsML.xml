<p>These are some of the leading stories in the Hong Kong press on Tuesday. Reuters has not verified these stories and does not vouch for their accuracy.</p>
<p>-- EXPRESS NEWS -- The Chief Executive's Office said all members of the regional and urban councils will retain their seats after the handover. Most of the additional new councillors appointed by the Office have a pro-Beijing background.</p>
<p>-- ECONOMIC JOURNAL -- Sources close to the Chief Executive's Office said the future government would take short- and long-term measures to cool down property speculation, and a new kind of tax for selling property within a short period after buying was almost certain.</p>
<p>-- APPLE DAILY -- Although Hong Kong police have said many times they will be fully in charge of protecting Chinese and foreign state leaders during the handover ceremony, sources said some Beijing bodyguards will bring their own guns to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>-- SING TAO -- Foreign organisations will be allowed to buy a maximum five percent stake each in Chinese insurance companies. The total shareholding by foreign investors in a mainland insurance company cannot exeed 25 percent.</p>
<p>-- TA KUNG PAO -- About 100,000 coloured flags and 800,000 pots of flowers will be used to decorate Beijing to welcome the Hong Kong handover, while big red lanterns will be raised at the Tiananmen Rostrum.</p>
<p>-- SOUTH CHINA MORNING POST -- The head of Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals has called for a delay in the opening of the new airport because of construction problems on the cargo terminal it would operate at Chek Lap Kok.</p>
<p>-- The Securities and Futures Commission announced additional risk management measures for the stock and futures markets in an effort to ensure stability once both markets re-open after the handover.</p>
<p>-- HONGKONG STANDARD -- Hong Kong's major banks, including HSBC Investment Bank, are vying to participate in a multi-billion dollar loan that China Telecom would use to fund its purchase of a 5.5 per cet stake in Hongkong Telecom.</p>
