<p>Arab Bank Group, one of the Middle East's major financial institutions, reported on Thursday a 13.8 percent rise in net profits to $95.6 million in the first half of 1996 against the same period in 1995.</p>
<p>"This is one of our best performances because of our activities in a number of branches abroad and in Jordan," Abdul-Majeed Shoman, chairman of Arab Bank Group, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Net profits stood at $84 million at end of June 1995.</p>
<p>Total net profits stood at $168 million in 1995.</p>
<p>The bank's total balance sheet rose 12.8 percent to $23.7 billion at end of June 1996 against $21 billion in the same period in 1995.</p>
<p>Customer deposits rose to $9.7 billion in first half 1996 from $8.8 billion in the same period last year. Loans, excluding provision for doubtful loans, stood at $6.3 billion against $5.6 billion in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Total shareholders equity rose to $1.241 billion from $1.189 billion at end June 1995, the bank's balance sheet showed. Total revenue rose to $243.8 million from $223.2 million at end June 1995.</p>
<p>Shoman said Arab Bank Group, with over 300 branches globally, had expanded its international presence with two new representative offices in Shanghai, China and in Santiago, Chile and boosted its "investments in quality risk assets."</p>
<p>The bank's shares, which account for over a third of the Amman Financial Market's cpitalisation, have driven the market higher since the government unveiled in August a package of reforms that include cancelling a 15 percent tax levied on companies' capital increases.</p>
<p>Arab Bank, a main beneficiary of the new draft companies law, has promised to distribute a bonus share to its shareholders once the tax is cancelled.</p>
<p>The bank said its capital adequacy ratio improved to 14 percent and the liquidity ratio -- the ability to meet short term cash obligations -- stood at 46.9 percent at end of June 1996.</p>
<p>The bank, established in 1930, is the oldest Palestinian bank. While focusing on expanding its global network in 1996, it also further extended its operations in Palestinian self-rule area to a total of 14 branches in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p>It has captured the main market share of a banking boom in self-rule areas after Middle East peace accords in 1993 allowed Jordanian banks to resume operations after a 26 years absence which followed Israel's seizure of the West Bank.</p>
