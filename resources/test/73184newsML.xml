<p>AT&amp;T Corp. is trying to regain footing in its core long distance telephone business with a new pricing plan and image advertising starting next month, but it faces an uphill fight in a cluttered telecommunications market.</p>
<p>The telephone behemoth, which on Tuesday said strong competition is putting unexpected pressure on its profits, unveiled  a "One Rate" pricing policy to win back consumers.</p>
<p>Analysts said AT&amp;T needs to present a distinct and clearly focused messgae if it hopes to stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T took shots at competitors for sowing confusing among consumers and claimed its ads "respond to consumers' desire for simplicity." But the One Rate ads it launched look remarkably similar to flat-rate plans already implemented by Sprint Corp. and MCI Communications Corp.</p>
<p>The market war declared by AT&amp;T is in fact a response to salvos fired by its biggest competitors months ago. By announcing "a new programme of marketing initiatives," AT&amp;T was just catching up to the others, analysts said.</p>
<p>In weeks ahead, advertising industry sources said, AT&amp;T must make a credible pitch that sells its discount plan, as Sprint achieved with "Dime Lady" Candace Bergen, who scores high in consumer polls for recognition and trust.</p>
<p>MCI also managed to put a face on its promotions using Whoopi Goldberg.</p>
<p>"Primarily, AT&amp;T is reacting to the effect of the Dime Lady" and a clutter of offers for telephone cards and discounts, said David Goodtree, an industry analyst with Forrester Research.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T ad agency FCB/Leber Katz is keeping the wraps on a new ad campaign it will launch for its client next month.</p>
<p>An agency spokeswoman, Vonda LePage, said, "I can't say if it's a celebrity or what, but we're hard at work on it and it will roll out in the middle of next month."</p>
<p>An initial series of "teaser" ads starts on Tuesday night on network television and on Wednesday appears in national newspapers.</p>
<p>It will attempt to underscore the simplicity of the AT&amp;T pricing plan with the kind of contraption that children play with -- using the headline: "The simplest calling plan since tin cans and a string."</p>
<p>The upcoming advertising work that FCB is doing on AT&amp;T's image may require a bit more complexity, just because it is arriving later at the party than its main competitors.</p>
<p>"It's hard to just throw out another celebrity -- MCI and Sprint have already done that," said one advertising executive at a Madison Avenue agency. "That formula's pretty well taken."</p>
<p>The sheer clutter of telecommunications advertising requires that ATT come up with a sharply focused advertising image for the new marketing initiative. Telephone advertising is one of the fastest-growing segments of the ad business, increasing by double digit rates annually.</p>
