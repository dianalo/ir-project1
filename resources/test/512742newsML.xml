<p>A trading halt in Crystallex International Corp stock sparked speculation on Wednesday that the company would announce positive news about its effort to claim part of Placer Dome Inc's Las Cristinas gold property in Venezuela, analysts said.</p>
<p>Crystallex shares were halted on the Toronto Stock Exchange after rising 0.81 to 4.01 on volume of 444,245 shares. Crystallex officials were unavailable for comment but in a recorded message a spokesman said the company would be issuing a news releases later today.</p>
<p>Analysts said rumors circulated that Crystallex would announce a positive development in its effort to gain title to two blocks of Las Cristinas, where Placer hopes to begin building a mine next month.</p>
<p>Crystallex announced in March that it acquired rights to two blocks of the property -- a contention vigorously disputed by Placer, Venezuelan officials and CVG, the Venezuelan state-owned company that is Placer's partner on the project.</p>
<p>Placer spokesman Hugh Leggatt said the company was aware of the halt in Crystallex stock, "but we can't shed any light on it."</p>
<p>He repeated comments made by Placer Chief Executive John Willson at the company's annual meeting on Tuesday that Placer strongly believed its title was secure.</p>
<p>Placer shares were off 0.20 at 23.20 in Toronto.</p>
<p>Analysts have said that Placer's tenure appeared solid but they noted that arrangements at Las Cristinas and the Venezuelan legal system were complex.</p>
<p>"There does appear some basis for this legal problem, but I think Crystellex's claim is frivolous," said one analyst, who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>But, he added, "Placer would be in deep trouble if they were to lose this."</p>
