<p>The staff of Oregon Public Utility Commission (OPUC), which will release Friday a final report on the proposed merger of Enron Corp and Portland General Electric Co, remains open to a merger settlement, but but only on its own terms.</p>
<p>"If we get a phone call from Enron and they are willing to take our last offer, we will call the parties together and make a deal," OPUC spokesman Mike Allegre said this week.</p>
<p>On Enron's side, however, nothing new is expected until after the staff releases the report, Enron spokesman Gary Foster said Thursday.</p>
<p>The staff said last month the final report would call for disapproval of the deal.</p>
<p>Earlier merger settlement talks faltered over the issue of a rate cut for Oregon electricity customers.</p>
<p>The OPUC staff said it will not recommend approval of the merger without a rate reduction of $160 million, compared with Enron's last offer of $61 million.</p>
<p>"We are looking at customer compensation (money owed to ratepayers to offset harm from the merger) and benefits (additional revenues associated with the merger)," explained Allegre.</p>
<p>Without a merger, nothing will change for Oregon ratepayers, who would get more long-term benefits if the deal does not go through, he said.</p>
<p>But he emphasized that the "door is still open" for a settlement.</p>
<p>The Oregon commission is scheduled to make final decision on the merger on June 4.</p>
