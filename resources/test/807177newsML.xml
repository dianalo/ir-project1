<p>*The long-end of the Australian bond market saw some light selling going into the close after a subdued session as it awaited developments in the U.S. after Friday's stock plunge.</p>
<p>*RBA bulletin, U.S. FOMC meeting on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>The Australian bond market succumbed to a fairly subdued start to the week as it awaited developments in the U.S. after Friday's hefty sell-off in the U.S. share market and any knock-on effect to U.S. Treasuries.</p>
<p>"We expect this week to be largely a case of where the U.S. (yield) curve goes, the Australian curve follows," said Societe Generale senior economist Glenn Maguire.</p>
<p>Maguire expects concerns about a possible tightening in German interest rate policy will weigh on the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>"This may counter any possible bullish news contained in the RBA quarterly report on the economy," he added.  </p>
<p>Tuesday will be a key day for central banks with fears that the Bundesbank will raise its repo rate, the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee due to hold its August meeting and the Reserve Bank of Australia releasing its quarterly bulletin.</p>
<p>The FOMC is expected to keep policy stable after the recent run of data dispelled immediate concerns over U.S. inflation and pushed thoughts of tighter policy towards the end of the year.</p>
<p>The RBA bulletin is expected to be a re-run of last week's speech by governor Ian Macfarlane, which came over far less hawkish than expected, although the market will be keen to hear the bank's thoughts on wages after last week's data.  </p>
<p>Last week's final second quarter wages data proved benign and has prompted thoughts of another easing in monetary policy.</p>
<p>December bill futures are pricing in a 25 basis point easing, despite some nervous selling across the futures curve going into the close, ending unchanged at 95.24. This equates to a cash rate of 4.76 percent and compares with current 5.0 percent official interest rates.</p>
<p>The local share market made a partial recovery from its initial fall of over 2.0 percent which had followed the 247 point tumble in the Dow Jones industrial average index on Friday amid concerns over corporate earnings and a weak U.S. dollar.  </p>

<p> NZD     -173 (- 05)   -44 (- 01) *</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The late sell-off saw yield spreads widen against U.S. and Canadian debt but tighter to New Zealand in the wake of comments by the RBNZ that monetary conditions were too loose.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury yields showed an easier bias in Tokyo trading after finishing narrowly mixed in New York on Friday.  </p>
<p>-------------------(TECHNICALS)-------------------------------</p>
<p>FUTURES     *SUP-RES	 *2ND SUP-RES   *3RD SUP-RES   *RSI</p>
<p>10-YEAR(SEP)*93.360-93.470 *93.310-93.520 *93.280-93.570 *51.44 3-YEAR (SEP)*94.31-94.36   *94.27-94.41   *94.21-94.46   *61.17</p>

<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The 10-year bond contract continues to find moves towards 93.470 resistance difficult to maintain, but support at 93.360 remained unscathed going into the close.</p>
