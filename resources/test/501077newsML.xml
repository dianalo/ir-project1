<p>Danish share prices closed slightly higher on Thursday, buoyed by shipping and oil group A.P. Moeller rises on its 1996 result, but dealers expected falls ahead up to the weekend.</p>
<p>"It was a dull day. Had it not been for Moeller stock rises, we would have closed lower. Falls are inevitable tomorrow, though Moeller should continue up," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The KFX top-20 index closed 0.14 point up at 154.18 in overall bourse turnover of 916 million crowns. The KFX June future fell 0.90 point to 152.80 with 70 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>Moeller's D/S 1912 and D/S Svendborg shares rose 6,400 and 13,500 crowns respectively to finish at 190,400 and 277,500 crowns.</p>
<p>Sophus Berendsen closed two crowns down at 825 after delivering as expected a disappointing 1996 result.</p>
