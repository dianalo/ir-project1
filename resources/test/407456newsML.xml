<p>Malaysia's Securities Commission said on Thursday that 15 stockbroking firms have been authorised to engage in securities borrowing and lending (SBL) which facilitates short selling of stocks.</p>
<p>They include leading stockbroking firm Rashid Hussain Securities, which was also the first company approved as an SBL agent, the Securities Commission said in a statement.</p>
<p>The others are Salomon Brothers International, Hwang-DBS Securities, TA Securities, CIMB Securities, OSK Securities, PB Securities, Arab-Malaysian Securities, K&amp;N Kenanga, United Traders Securities, Eng Securities, InterPacific Securities, Thong KHJC, BBMB Securities and Jupiter Securities.</p>
<p>Short selling, which until September 30, 1996 was illegal in Malaysia, is used for arbitrage on stocks as well as to hedge portfolios.</p>
<p>Response so far to the launch of regulated short-selling has been lukewarm, analysts said, adding that investors and market participants will have to be educated about the practice to make it a success.</p>
<p>Malaysian regulators has initially allowed 50 stocks -- mostly highly liquid, well-capitalised blue chips -- that can be sold short.</p>
<p>The Securities Commission has said that the SBL will facilitate trading and arbitrage when the stock options market begins operation. Presently, only stock futures are traded on the benchmark Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange Composite Index.</p>
