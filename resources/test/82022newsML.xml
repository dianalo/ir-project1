<p>PepsiCo Inc said on Friday its 1997 earnings would likely be about $0.10 below current forecasts.</p>
<p>"In our view at this point in time it would be prudent to assume that next year's numbers will probably be a dime less than you may be currenty carrying ...(for) total PepsiCo," a company spokeswoman told analysts on a telephone conference.  </p>
<p>According to First Call analysts' mean forcast for PepsiCo's 1997 earnings is for $1.62 a share.</p>
<p>Chief executive Roger Enrico said, excluding the company's international soft-drink operations, he expected a rise in fourth quarter earnings.</p>
<p>"Certainly without PCI (PepsiCola International) we are looking for an up quarter, from an apples to apples operations-to-operations type basis," Enrico said.</p>
<p>The company earned $0.35 a share before charges in 1995's fourth quarter, after a two-for-one stock split.  </p>
<p>Late Thursday PepsiCo said it expected earnings per share for the third quarter to be about $0.30 below the same period last year, citing an estimated $360 million pre-tax charge to be incurred in its international beverage business.</p>
