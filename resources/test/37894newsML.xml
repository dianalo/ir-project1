<text>
<p>-- Hambrecht &amp; Quist said it cut its rating on the shares of Komag Inc to buy from strong buy after the company late Thursday said its third quarter results would fall below analysts expectations.</p>
<p>-- The third quarter is being hampered by delays in ramping new porducts, low yields on new products, soft demand for older products and several one-time events.</p>
<p>-- Hambrecht &amp; Quist said it expects health sequential sales to return in the fourth quarter, and it said the company's long-term fundamentals remain solid.</p>
