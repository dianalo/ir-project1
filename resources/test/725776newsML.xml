<title>SINGAPORE: Asian crude - Tapis traded at deep discount.</title>

<p>Asian crude prices firmed slightly on Monday on strength in the west late last week, traders said.</p>
<p>August Tapis swap was bid at $19.05 per barrel late Monday, up 20 cents from Friday, unperturbed by a shock physical deal.</p>
<p>News a western trader had sold an August Tapis cargo to a U.S. major at APPI -40 stunned the market, causing traders to reassess their outlook for the light crude market.</p>
<p>The same seller had earlier bought the Tapis from a producer at APPI +2, leading some traders to question if there was more to the deal than was known so far.  </p>
<p>Traders had expected Tapis premiums against APPI to stabilise because APPI outright quotes have been falling.</p>
<p>The premium of 2 cents was the lowest seen in over a year.</p>
<p>But some refiners said that with gasoil prices still under $20.00, it was natural that Tapis levels had to fall further to provide respite to refining margins.</p>
<p>"APPI Tapis has been falling mainly with Brent prices, not with gasoil. Refiners would be operating at negative margins if they were to run Tapis," said a trader with a major oil company.</p>
<p>Heavy crudes remained supported, with 150,000 barrels of August Minas heard sold by an equity holder to Japan at ICP +85.  </p>
<p>The Middle East crude market was thin, with August trading almost finished.</p>
<p>Only a few partial cargoes of Oman and Abu Dhabi crudes are available.</p>
<p>But traders said that at least three cargoes of August Masila were still on offer, with limited interest seen, following a wider Brent/Dubai spread.</p>
<p>A western trader sold September Oman to a South Korean refiner, in exchange for a September Dubai, at a differential of 23 cents.</p>
