<p>Serbia plans to set up an export support fund to help its industries increase competitiveness abroad, Industry Minister Zivota Cosic (Corrects Minister's last name from Ristic) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The government has taken the initiative to establish a fund to help export-oriented industries and we expect the federal government to accept it," Cosic told Reuters.</p>
<p>The government will give its final say on the issue by June 1, Cosic said.</p>
<p>"I cannot talk about the size of the fund because first we need to see what sources of financing we have. But any financing will come from real sources. This is a big step forward and an offensive approach by the government," he said.</p>
<p>The establishment of the export support fund was a part of the government's wider strategy to kick-start its vital metal-processing complex to take part in five billion dinars ($880 million) worth of various industrial programmes.</p>
<p>The metal-processing industry was promised to take an active part in the China oil-for-industrial goods barter deal, revitalising the Zastava car production, some local power industry projects, telecommunications, railroads and trans-Yugoslav highways. -- Gordana Filipovic, Belgrade newsroom, +381 11 222 4254</p>
