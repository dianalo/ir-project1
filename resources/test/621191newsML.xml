<p>Foreign investors are wary of the current frenzy surrounding red chip issues in Hong Kong, and will wait for a correction before committing major fresh money to the sector.</p>
<p>Fund managers told Reuters the red chip market, representing Hong-Kong incorporated and listed stocks with a China-based parent, was expensive and prices were at risk from any reduction in liquidity.</p>
<p>Also, there was concern that the confidence shown in sometimes untried and untested management teams could backfire in the longer term if any of the groups ran into problems.</p>
<p>An IPO from Beijing Enterprises, a conglomerate with a wide range of holdings, is due to debut in Hong Kong on Thursday. It was 1,276 times subscribed and with a $40 grey market price was sitting at a premium to net asset value of about 100 percent.</p>
<p>"I believe firmly that the Chinese economy is going to be very important in the next year or two but the prices being paid suggest slightly bubble-like behaviour," said Philip Ehrmann, head of emerging markets at Gartmore Investment Management.</p>
<p>"There is no reason for the 100 percent premiums when a company like CITIC Pacific is on around 30 percent," Foreign &amp; Colonial Emerging Markets fund manager Stephanie Wu said.</p>
<p>"We don't even try for our big accounts (with the IPOs). If we believe it is a good company we buy it in the market afterwards...We would wait until it moderates a bit and the premium comes off," said Wu.</p>
<p>She said the risk to liquidity lay in Chinese regulatory authorities clamping down on retail and corporate Chinese investors in Hong Kong, as well as global interest rates.</p>
<p>"If the liquidity tapers off a little bit we could see these premiums come off quite sharply," Wu said.</p>
<p>But she said the red chip market was one of the most accessible and liquid routes to China.</p>
<p>She said the high premiums were the result of speculation about the injection of fresh assets into the groups, but in the case of Beijing Enterprises business expansion rather than asset injection was more likely in the near term.</p>
<p>She said another route to the market was through "purple chips" -- generally offshoots of Hong Kong blue chips with their earnings base in China.</p>
<p>Her $80 million fund watches among other things about 25 red chips, as well as IPOs. It was up 50 percent in 1996 in mark terms and 30 percent in the year to date.</p>
<p>Other fund managers said the concern for the market was the uncertainty surrounding the future structure of the companies and the high valuations.</p>
<p>Ehrmann said current major interest was a reflection of hopes that China was "turning a significant corner".</p>
<p>"I am afraid it is a bit like Russia and some of the eastern European markets where one just assumes that companies that are loss-making can be profitable if the economy recovers."</p>
<p>He said Gartmore was exposed to China, but was circumspect as to which red chips if any it was playing, focusing instead on Hong Kong companies likely to benefit from what was happening on the mainland.</p>
<p>"The potential of the country is huge but accessing it and avoiding some of the lumps that we have on the way is going to be a challenge," said Ehrmann.</p>
<p>A fund manager in the UK investing in the region said liquidity arising mostly from Chinese and Hong Kong retail investors was driving the market at present, and said she would not be looking to get further exposure.</p>
<p>"We have a limited exposure but we are not building it. At least in the short term we think there should be some retraction."</p>
<p>She said most of the fund's exposure was in Hong Kong companies investing in China.</p>
