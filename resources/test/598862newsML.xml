<headline>Palladium hits the highest price this decade.</headline>

<p>Palladium soared to its highest price of the 1990s in London on Tuesday as lack of material forced buyers to pay more for the rare white metal.</p>
<p>Palladium fixed at $179.75 per ounce, its strongest fixing since $181.50 recorded on April 14, 1989.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning had seen it at $177.50, its highest in more than five years. On January 2 this year it was valued at $120.75 and even that was the highest since late September 1996.</p>
<p>"It's to do with (Russian) non-delivery, Tokyo (futures market) positions and fund interest all happening together," a dealer said.</p>
<p>The surge also coincides with London's Platinum Week when producers, users and dealers in platinum, palladium and their lesser sister metals gather for meetings and socialising.</p>
<p>Market liquidity has tightened all year as administrative problems delayed exports from Russia, the leading producer. About half of Russia's exports come from ever diminishing government stockpiles. Their size is a tightly held secret.</p>
<p>Russia accounts for around 67 percent of world supply of the metal which is used mainly in autocatalysts for cleaning up car exhaust gases, in electronics and for dental alloys.</p>
<p>Japan is the major importer.</p>
<p>Shipments could begin late June, Russian officials said.</p>
<p>But that has done nothing to alleviate the dearth of currently available material.</p>
<p>Borrowing rates have soared to around 26 per cent for a month, from a more normal two percent.</p>
<p>"At that rate it is too expensive just to borrow for a couple of days so you have to buy which tightens the liquidity even more," a senior dealer said.</p>
<p>It has also introduced potential price volatility. "I would not be surprised to see palladium $20 higher or lower than it is now within a few days," one dealer said.</p>
<p>In 1980 when gold and silver prices were rocketing to record levels, palladium hit its historic peak at around $270.00.</p>
<p>Palladium was last at current levels in 1989 when reports suggested that a "cold fusion" process could use the metal as a catalyst to produce apparently limitless energy. Supplies from the second largest producer South Africa were also disrupted.</p>
<p>"These were exceptional times, much more so than now," commented one long-serving market analyst.</p>
<p>Gold edged up 50 cents on Tuesday to $343.00, silver was at $4.72/$4.74 up eight cents and platinum was $7.25 firmer at $396.50/$397.50.-Brian Spoors London Newsroom +44 171 542 8058</p>
