<headline>Oil World sees sharply lower E. Europe rape crops.</headline>

<p>A lower rapeseed acreage and severe winter damage sharply reduced eastern European crops this year, the Oil World newsletter said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The independent publication said the region's combined crop would be 1.3 million tonnes, one million less than in 1995.</p>
<p>The area would be a net importer in 96/97 (July/June) after Poland and the Czech republic exported to the EU-15 in 95/96.</p>
<p>But the tightness would be partly offset by higher sunflowerseed output.</p>
<p>Poland was seen harvesting 500,000 tonnes or less in 1996 against 1.36 million last year.</p>
<p>The crop in the Czech republic should be 500,000 tonnes, down from 663,000 tonnes in 1995.</p>
<p>Hungary, Slovakia and former Yugoslavia would harvest a combined 300,000 tonnes versus 269,000 last year.</p>
<p>Oil World said if Poland's crop really turned out lower than 500,000 tonnes, this would result in higher import requirements for seeds, oils and fats. --Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275</p>
