<p>Russian clubs can forget dreams of European glory and must make hard choices if standards in the domestic game are not to fall further, said Russia's top soccer official on Wednesday in a searching assessment on the eve of a new season.</p>
<p>"Russian football has no potential for results just now," Russian Football Union (RFS) president Vyacheslav Koloskov told Reuters ahead of the opening of the 1997 campaign on Sunday.</p>
<p>Calling for the number of league clubs to be slashed by more than a third, a much smaller premier league and a western-style calendar, Koloskov forecast last autumn's European wipe-out of Russian sides would be repeated up to the end of the century.</p>
<p>"People who say Russian football should be among the best in in Europe totally fail to understand," said Koloskov, who has spent more than a decade in charge of Soviet and Russian soccer and led it through the collapse of state funding in 1991.</p>
<p>"OK, so the Russian league can in some limited situations be something approaching interesting," he said.</p>
<p>"But this season our clubs had only stepped on to the European stage before they were shown where they stand in international football."</p>
<p>Of nine Russian sides in Europe this season, none reached the third round.</p>
<p>Koloskov, a FIFA vice-president, is credited with helping persuade UEFA to let 1995 league titleholders Alania Vladikavkaz host Liverpool and Glasgow Rangers at their no-frills ground just 40 km (25 miles) from the fighting in rebel Chechnya.</p>
<p>But Russia's champions went of the European Cup after a 7-2 home drubbing by Rangers in last September's qualifying round.</p>
<p>"For at least another two seasons Russian clubs are going to get knocked out in the first or second rounds," Koloskov said.</p>
<p>The collapse of what he calls "the Soviet soccer empire", which deprived Russian sport of massive state funding, has meant the closure of training facilities and youth programmes. It has also seen a flood of players to high-paying foreign clubs.</p>
<p>"The saddest thing is that this collapse is continuing," he said. "Yet what stays the same? Our ambitions..."</p>
<p>The premier league will be cut to 16 teams from 18 for the 1998 season but Koloskov says even that is too many. He also wants to scrap the vast, regionally divided third division, reducing the number of professional league clubs from 192 to no But he has failed to end resistance, mainly among hard-up smaller clubs, to a plan to switch to an autumn-spring season. Big clubs, like reigning champions Spartak Moscow, say being out of step hurts them in Europe.</p>
<p>Koloskov is confident of winning the argument eventually.</p>
<p>"I'm convinced that at the end of the day we'll get support," he said. "The whole of Europe plays that way, why don't we accept it? They say our winter is too long. Well, we shouldn't argue the point, just create the right conditions -- lay heated pitches and build covered stadiums."</p>
<p>Eight premier sides will play their first two "home" games this season at neutral grounds for failing to install heating.</p>
<p>In the midst of economic crisis, though, it will be a long time before many Russian grounds meet western standards.</p>
<p>Koloskov this month denied reports he is considering bidding for the 2006 World Cup finals, saying that even in nine years' time Russia will not have the stadiums to stage the event.</p>
