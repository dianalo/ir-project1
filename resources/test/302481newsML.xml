<p>South Africa could be courting a new foreign policy embarrassment if it approves a proposed arms sale to Syria, political analysts said.</p>
<p>South African government officials said on Sunday the deal, for tank fire control systems worth three billion rand ($641 million), was due to for a final decision by Deputy President Thabo Mbeki by the end of the month.</p>
<p>Syria, at the centre of one of the world's perennial tension zones, is on a list of countries along with Libya, Iraq, Iran and North Korea that the United States accuses of sponsoring terrorism.</p>
<p>Washington bars arms sales to these countries and the South African Sunday Times newspaper reported that Pretoria was treading cautiously because of this. South Africa has already offended the United States by maintaining warm relations with Cuba, Libya and Iran.</p>
<p>Laurie Nathan, a member of the state-appointed Cameron Commission probing past illegal South African arms deals, said it was peculiar that President Nelson Mandela's government was even considering selling arms to Damascus.</p>
<p>"It's a very clear cut case, this is not the kind of country that South Africa should be arming," Nathan told Reuters.</p>
<p>"This is not a democratic legitimate government that respects human rights and plays a constructive role in regional security arrangements. It's not at all consistent with cabinet's own policy on arms sales."</p>
<p>Mandela's government, on taking office in 1994 as the country's first democratic government guaranteeing human rights for all, declared that it would impose strict moral guidelines on arms exports.</p>
<p>It said it would not sell arms to countries in strife zones or to those that abused human rights.</p>
<p>But last year it approved an arms sale to Rwanda during a brief lull in the ethnic conflict there, although it suspended further sales weeks later when fighting flared up again.</p>
<p>Nathan said the only motive for South Africa to want to sell arms to Syria was commercial gain.</p>
<p>"It's a lot of money, I think that's the beginning and the end of it. South Africa does not have any coherent position on the Middle East," he said.</p>
<p>Greg Mills, a researcher at the South African Institute of International Affairs, said arms sales to Syria could lead to the United States imposing sanctions on Pretoria.</p>
<p>"There are a large number of dangers," he said.</p>
<p>"In a macro sense one would have to look at how it is going to impact on other relations in the Middle East, particularly on South Africa's relationship with Israel, and whether it's going to do anything to contribute to or detract from the peace process there.</p>
<p>"For South Africa, given the fact that it is trying to take the moral high ground in foreign policy, not with a great deal of success, it would certainly undermine its position to be seen to be fuelling rather than pouring water on the flames," Mills said.</p>
<p>But he noted that South Africa had refused to sell artillery to Turkey in 1995 because of its anti-Kurd military campaign, only for other Western powers to step in and take the contracts.</p>
<p>Bill Sass, a member of the independent Institute for Defence Policy think tank, said the equipment involved in the proposed sale to Syria consisted of an upgrade to the fire control system for Soviet-made T-72 tanks.</p>
<p>"It includes range finders, telescopes, periscopes and electronic gadgetry. It won't make these tanks into world beaters, but it will improve them."</p>
<p>Sass said the main advantage for Syria would be in extending the lifespan of tanks which were already quite old and would be extremely expensive to replace from scratch.</p>
<p>All South African arms sales have to be approved by a committee chaired by Water and Forests Minister Kader Asmal, which includes representatives of the department of foreign affairs.</p>
<p>Asmal on Monday referred queries about the Syrian arms sale to Jakes Gerwel, director of Mandela's office, who was not immediately available for comment.</p>
