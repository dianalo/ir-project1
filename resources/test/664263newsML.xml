<p>Israeli soldiers shot and wounded at least 38 Palestinians in the third day of clashes with stone-throwing Arabs in the divided West Bank town of Hebron on Monday, witnesses and hospital officials said.</p>
<p>In Gaza, Jewish settlers shot and wounded one Palestinian youth and fired at least three bullets at journalists during a clash over land which Arabs said had recently been fenced off and annexed to the Gush Qatif settlement bloc.</p>
<p>The violence underscored rising Israel-PLO tensions over a three month deadlock in peace efforts and what Palestinians view as an Israeli drive to expand Jewish settlements in Gaza and the West Bank.</p>
<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the Palestinian Authority on Monday of ordering the violence in Gaza and of doing nothing to stop unrest in Hebron.</p>
<p>"There was a clear set of instructions a few days ago in Gaza for the violence that took place there," Netanyahu told reporters after he addressed a parliamentary committee in Jerusalem, referring to unrest last Thursday.</p>
<p>"I can't tell you about Hebron in the last 24 hours because I haven't seen the reports. But I can tell you that the Palestinian police have refrained from acting against the violence," he said.</p>
<p>The fiercest unrest erupted in Hebron along an invisible line that divides the city into Israeli and Palestinian-controlled areas.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated bullets at about 100 youths who were hurling stones and petrol bombs.</p>
<p>They said at least 38 Palestinians, including an 11-year-old boy, were wounded in the clashes. Officials at the city's Alia hospital said surgeons were trying to remove a rubber-coated bullet from the boy's mouth.</p>
<p>Some of the wounded were treated by doctors who set up a first-aid area in the courtyard of a Hebron petrol station, a few hundred metres away from the fighting.</p>
<p>The Israeli army said in a statement one border policeman was hit by a stone and slightly wounded. It said troops dispersed the demonstrators.</p>
<p>Palestinians said Israeli troops had refrained from using tear gas to quell complaints from the city's 400 Jewish settlers that the fumes were affecting them. The army declined comment.</p>
<p>Israeli soldiers shot and wounded about 45 Arabs on Saturday and Sunday during clashes that erupted over a recent U.S. House of Representatives vote calling on President Bill Clinton to recognise Arab East Jerusalem as part of Israel's capital.</p>
<p>Faisal al-Husseini, the PLO's top official in Jerusalem, and Palestinian legislators demonstrated earlier on Monday near the U.S. Consulate in East Jerusalem to protest against the vote.</p>
<p>Israel handed 80 percent of Hebron to Palestinian rule in January under an interim peace deal but kept troops in parts of the town to protect the settler enclaves.</p>
<p>In the Gaza Strip, Jewish settlers shot and wounded a Palestinian youth in the knee when angry Arabs tried to remove a fence erected by Gush Katif settlers, witnesses said.</p>
<p>They said settlers also fired three bullets at Palestinian journalists on the scene. None was wounded.</p>
<p>"I shouted to the settler in Hebrew that we were reporters, but he swore at us and continued to fire his pistol. One bullet barely missed us," a Reuters reporter said.</p>
<p>A settler spokesman confirmed a clash had taken place but said he knew nothing about shooting at journalists.</p>
<p>"They broke into our farming village...and started destroying property. Our residents kicked them out," Gush Katif settler spokesman Shlomo Kostiner told Reuters.</p>
<p>Witnesses said Israeli soldiers who arrived on the scene kicked and punched reporters and fired tear gas at the demonstrators who had camped near the site.</p>
