<p>Germany's Deutsche Lufthansa AG, in a widely expected move, said on Wednesday partnership efforts among a group of airlines would be branded under the name "Star Alliance" but no merger would take place.</p>
<p>The airline said the alliance, which includes Lufthansa, United Airlines, Air Canada, Scandinavian Airlines Systems and Thai Airways International Ltd, would also add Brazil's Varig Airlines.</p>
<p>But Lufthansa said the partner airlines, who have been working closely together with code-share flights for a few years, would not take equity stakes in one-another and each airline would retain its individual identity.  </p>
<p>"It is not our intention to merge our airlines nor to develop identical product offerings. Our research tells us categorically that our customers enjoy and appreciate our varied cultures," the airlines said in a statement.</p>
<p>The formal partnership will create one of the largest alliances in the industry and rival that announced last year by British Airways and American Airlines.</p>
<p>But the airlines made no mention of adding other partner airlines, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, as some industry officials had expected.</p>
<p>The alliance airlines said their combined revenues in 1996 would have totalled $42.3 billion and they would have carried about 174 million passengers on flights around the world.</p>
<p>The airlines, in the joint statement issued at a news conference in Frankfurt, also said they did not expect the partnership to violate regulatory anti-competition laws.</p>
<p>"The Star Alliance poses no threat to competition and provides distinct customer benefits," the airlines said.</p>
<p>The carriers noted anti-trust immunity already exists for the relationship between United, Lufthansa and SAS in the United States and immunity for United's alliance with Air Canada is pending.</p>
<p>The European Union is investigating the alliance, but the carriers said in the statement that they did not expect any problems from the review by Brussels.</p>
<p>The formal deal calls for common branding in marketing and advertising and to intensify, when possible, coordination of routes and the offering of code-share flights under which passengers can be passed on from one partner to another.</p>
<p>Passengers will also be able to accumulate and redeem mileage points on any of the partner airlines and for further integration of some airport operations, purchasing and ticketing operations.</p>
<p>"The Star Alliance brand will provide a mark of quality and benefits, including worldwide recognition. The brand name will compliment - but not replace - each airline's individual identity and product offerings in their home markets and around the world," the airlines said in the statement.</p>
