<p>Nearby tightness arrived on the London Metal Exchange (LME) copper market on Monday, as premiums of $23/$24 a tonne were indicated to borrow metal for one day.</p>
<p>The benchmark cash/threes backwardation is a high $310/320, but the sensitive dates are from Jan 29, which is tradeable as cash today, out to early-February in the first instance.</p>
<p>"There was quite a bit of covering on the cash/day spread...and for a week, which traded at $95 backwardation," one trader said.</p>
<p>The level of $23/24 for one day is just $1 under the limit allowed for the daily backwardation. This is one percent of the previous day's cash metal price.</p>
<p>Copper's current tightness has been building up remorselessly since end-December, and reflects a combination of actual physical shortages and major short positions from a speculative sell-off in autumn 1996, with European merchants on the long side of the market.</p>
<p>There is also persistent talk that a big Asian player has also been caught out, and is heavily short during this crunch period, as well as the February date.</p>
<p>"What they appear to have done is grant options, but they may not have hedges against them. They've taken the premium, and now they'll have to bite the bullet," another trader said.</p>
<p>Others said the company concerned was also a player in the aluminium and zinc markets, and given the recent price advances in these metals, as well as copper, it was likely that there were short positions against options that had run into-the-money.</p>
<p>In copper, the impact of the rising price and the burgeoning backwardation has been to lift the February copper date to around $2,350 at present.</p>
<p>Some said the company granted what were out-of-the-money calls from $2,200, and there are some 940 lots (23,500 tonnes) open at this strike at present.</p>
<p>The other factor that has caused some concern among traders is the extent of the credit lines that the Asian company and its trading subsidiaries has with various brokers.</p>
<p>"Some of the brokers have accounts with the parent, which is O.K. But others have accounts with a subsidiary company, which is not so highly capitalised," one said.</p>
<p>This is why some brokers are worried about extending these particular credit lines, the trader added.</p>
<p>In the short-term, the tightness may be calmed by rising LME stocks, as the backwardation is pulling some metal on to the market.</p>
<p>On Friday, LME stocks rose by 12,775 tonnes to 156,000 tonnes - the first time the overall inventory total has exceeded 150,000 tonnes since last October.</p>
<p>The increase since November when stocks reached a low point of 90,050 tonnes has been nearly 66,000 tonnes or around 73 percent.</p>
<p>"That (156,000 tonnes) is still low, however. The question at the moment is whether the shorts have rolled forward or are squared off," a floor trader added.</p>
<p>LME stocks are expected to rise again on Tuesday with traders indicating an increase of around 8,000 tonnes.</p>
