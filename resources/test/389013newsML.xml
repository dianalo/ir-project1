<p>Marriott International Inc said it expects its proposed $1 billion acquisition of Renaissance Hotel Group NV to dilute earnings per share through 1998.</p>
<p>In response to a question during a media conference call detailing the transaction, Marriott chief financial officer Michael Stein said 1997 earnings would be trimmed by about $0.10 to $0.14 per share, assuming a first quarter deal closing.</p>
<p>Earnings in 1998 would suffer a similar reduction because of the acqusition, he said.</p>
<p>Excluding Marriott's newly-lowered earnings outlook, Wall Street analysts were expecting the Maryland-based lodging company to earn between $2.46 and $2.65 per share in 1997 and $3.09 per share in 1998, according to Zack's Investment Research.</p>
<p>Henry Cheng, chairman and CEO of Hong Kong-based Renaissance, would join the Marriott board and said Renaissance will pay Doubletree Corp a $15 million merger break-up fee since Renaissance walked away from its $890 million Dounbletree merger agreement.</p>
<p>Marriott chairman J.W. Marriott said the Renaissance acquistion would add 150 hotels to Marriott's collection, an increase that positions the company to exceed its goal of having 2,000 hotels by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Marriott also said the Renaissance deal -- to be financed through an existing credit facility and cash on hand -- would give Marriott International entree into 40 new markets, including Russia, China, Italy, India, Vietnam and Turkey.</p>
<p>The deal has the backing of New World Development Co Ltd, a Hong Kong- based real estate development company, which holds a 54 percent stake in Renaissance.</p>
