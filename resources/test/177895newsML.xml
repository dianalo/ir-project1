<title>CHINA: China media mum on conviction of princeling.</title>
<headline>China media mum on conviction of princeling.</headline>
<dateline>BEIJING 1996-11-09</dateline>

<p>China's state media made no mention on Saturday of a suspended death sentence handed down to the son of an influential party official for economic crimes.</p>
<p>A Beijing court has convicted Zhou Beifang, former chairman of Hong Kong-listed affiliates of the giant state-owned Capital Iron and Steel Corporation, as part of China's highly-publicised anti-graft campaign launched last year, a Chinese source said.</p>
<p>Zhou's sentence was one of the heaviest handed down to a so-called "princeling", the popular sobriquet applied to the children of China's ruling party elite, who enjoy wide influence.</p>
<p>No other details of the case were available.</p>
<p>Major newspapers and the official Xinhua news agency were mum on Zhou's conviction and court officials could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>In China, suspended death sentences are often commuted to life imprisonment after two years.</p>
<p>Last month, prosecutors filed charges of corruption against 30 people, including Zhou and two former officials of the Beijing city government.</p>
<p>Chinese courts frequently impose the death penalty in major corruption cases.</p>
<p>The Zhous have close ties to the family of paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>Zhou was detained in February, 1995, forcing his father, Zhou Guanwu, to resign as chairman and Communist Party secretary of Capital Iron and Steel Corporation.</p>
<p>Corruption was virtually eliminated in the years after the communists came to power in 1949, but has staged a comeback along with economic reforms in the past 17 years.</p>
<p>Communist Party chief and state president Jiang Zemin has declared war on corruption, warning that the scourge was a virus that threatened the party.</p>
