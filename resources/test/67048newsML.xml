<p>Fresh supplies of gasoline from China's new Dalian refinery are threatening the Asian market just as it adapts to its new role as a net exporter, industry officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>They said the new Dalian supplies would increase competition and worry traders already working hard to find outlets for the region's surplus.</p>
<p>"The new Dalian refinery will have a bigger impact on the market" than new refineries elsewhere in Asia which have flooded and depressed the market since July, a Japanese trader said.</p>
<p>The Dalian West Pacific Petrochemical Co, China's largest joint venture refinery set up to export gasoline, is by owned by Total SA of France and several Chinese companies, including state oil giant SINOCHEM.</p>
<p>Sources close to the venture said the 100,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) Dalian refinery would start trial runs at the end of September and should be exporting 40,000 bpd by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The refinery's start up date, originally scheduled for May 1995, has been delayed several times and the sources could not give a firm date when the refinery would start commercial operations.</p>
<p>Traders said the possibility of fresh gasoline supplies made the outlook for November and December uncertain.</p>
<p>New refining capacity in Asia has added to a regional surplus. Thailand alone is estimated to have started exporting up to 43,000 bpd since July.</p>
<p>Traders said they had been moving some of the surplus to South and East Africa, Australia and South America.</p>
<p>"It is interesting how quickly the region as a whole has reacted to the surplus," a trader in Singapore.</p>
<p>"Cargoes have been moving out, Saudi Yanbu import barrels have been shut off and refiners in Asia have cut runs. The supply side has been taken care of," he said.</p>
<p>"It is now a regular trend that cargoes from our region are going elsewhere," said another trader.</p>
<p>But traders said if additional Chinese supplies hit the markets at the end of the year, it might not be so easy to find buyers.</p>
<p>They said sales outside the region were possible up to October, because prices in the Mediterranean and the United States were higher.</p>
<p>But with peak summer demand tailing off, there are already concerns about oversupply in the United States and gasoline prices fell sharply in New York on Thursday.</p>
<p>The October contract on the New York Merchantile Exchange settled 1.74 cents lower at 61.32 cents a gallon after falling as low as 60.40 cents during the day.</p>
<p>Singapore prices have firmed because of the sales outside the region, with the price of a barrel of gasoline rising by around $2.00 since mid-August to more than $23.00 on Thursday.</p>
<p>They could go still higher, closing the gap with prices in Europe and the United States, making Dalian's exports a depressing market factor, the traders said.</p>
