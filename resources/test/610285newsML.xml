<p>Italian Posts and Telecommunications Minister Antonio Maccanico on Friday confirmed that a tender offer for the country's third mobile phone licence will take place by June.</p>
<p>Maccanico told reporters that the regulations covering various European Union directives necessary to get the tender underway had already been approved by parliament and now only needed the cabinet's go-ahead which was expected very soon.</p>
<p>"So the tender offer will be able to start by June," he said.</p>
<p>Several companies have expressed interest in the third operating licence including Italian multi-media group Mediaset, in partnership with British Telecom and Italian bank BNL in the Albacom joint venture.</p>
<p>Italy currently has two mobile phone service operators, state-controlled Telecom Italia Mobile (TIM) and Olivetti -controlled Omnitel Pronto Italia.</p>
