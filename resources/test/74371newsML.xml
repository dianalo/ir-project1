<p>Germany gave in to the United States Wednesday in a dispute over the way it awards public works contracts, staving off Washington's threat of sanctions by pledging a rapid appeals process for bidders in disputed cases.</p>
<p>The decision, made by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's cabinet, to seek legislation for an appeals system should avert a U.S. threat to impose sanctions on September 30 over complaints brought by General Electric Corp and Westinghouse Electric Corp.</p>
<p>"Today's decision will lead to a suspension of the sanctions," Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt told reporters.</p>
<p>Acting U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky set the sanctions deadline after the companies said they had suffered unfair discrimination in a bid last year for two turbine contracts worth several hundred million dollars each.</p>
<p>Rexrodt said that Washington had threatened to bar German companies from taking part in public works tenders in the U.S., but added that would now not be enforced.</p>
<p>"The planned regulation should make the award process more transparent by improving the legal protection for bidders," Rexrodt said, adding that concerns expressed by the European Union had also been considered.</p>
<p>Billions of dollars worth of future contracts to rebuild eastern Germany's battered infrastructure are at stake, and the decision could open up a cosy tender system which dates back to the 1930s.</p>
<p>A source at the U.S. embassy in Bonn welcomed the move as "an extremely important step."</p>
<p>Barshefsky will review the companies' complaint by the end of this month and the source said the sanctions would probably not be enforced. Washington will be looking for Germany to pass interim measures during the legislative process, which could last up to a year, the source added.</p>
<p>The new arbitration system would envisage two phases: The first would be an administrative check which would take no more than eight weeks.</p>
<p>In cases where no settlement can be reached, a second stage would be handled by a regional court within five weeks.</p>
<p>"There would be no delay to the procurement process -- rather an acceleration," Rexrodt said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for General Electric's German unit said the company was happy with the decision, but said there was no hope of reversing the award of the lost turbine contract.</p>
<p>"We fundamentally welcome any decision which opens tenders to international bidders and not just to a closed circle of German companies," GE spokesman Rudolf Beyenburg told Reuters.</p>
<p>The legislation, based on a Danish model, will be drafted after broad consultation, but will be subject to the approval of the opposition-controlled Bundesrat upper house of parliament, Rexrodt said.</p>
