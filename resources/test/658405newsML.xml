<p>China's top securities and futures watchdog has withdrawn the business licence of a Beijing-based futures company for making false financial statements, the Shanghai Securities News said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) investigation found that Jiaxin Futures Co had supplied accountants with false profit and loss statements, including a false statement of registered capital, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The company had also made unauthorised changes to its leadership without the approval of the CSRC, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The CSRC has banned the company from trading commodities futures contracts and ordered it to offset existing positions within 20 days, the newspaper said.</p>
