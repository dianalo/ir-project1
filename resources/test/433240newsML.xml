<p>Interest rate futures traded on SIMEX hovered in tight ranges on Tuesday as a lack of fresh leads and poor market interest hampered activity.</p>
<p>Dealers said Euroyen and Japanese government bond (JGB) futures failed to react to a larger than expected rise in Japan's January machinery orders.</p>
<p>The Economic Planning Agency said private machinery orders rose 11.8 percent in January from December.</p>
<p>"There was a bit of a buy-back after Tokyo closed," said a Japanese bank dealer, noting that players bought Euroyen futures after the strong machinery data failed to trigger a sell-off.  </p>
<p>Reports that Ajinomoto Co was being investigated for suspected links with racketeers also left the market unexcited.</p>
<p>"It seems there's nothing much affecting the market at the moment," said the dealer.</p>
<p>December Euroyen was quoted at 99.19 at 1110 GMT against its IMM close at 99.19 on volume of 2,325 lots. June JGBs settled at 125.62 against their previous 125.36.</p>
<p>A trader with an Asian institution said the JGBs would be supported at 125.22 with resistance seen at 125.64 and 125.70.  </p>
<p>But he said Euroyen and JGB futures were likely to be confined to their recent ranges ahead of the Japanese financial year end on March 31 and the Bank of Japan's business sentiment survey on April 2.</p>
<p>Eurodollar futures finished little changed in line with a lacklustre overnight session in U.S. treasuries. September ended at 93.995 versus its IMM close at 93.990 on 5,495 lots.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was awaiting February retail sales and producer price data later in the week for an indication of potential inflationary pressures.</p>
