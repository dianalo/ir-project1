<p>Leading Russian shares firmed gently in quiet morning trade on Monday, but a surprise announcement that Russia would re-denominate the rouble next year had no effect on the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>They saw the market little changed by the end of the trading session in the absence of significant Western or domestic demand.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System 22-share index opened at 511.40 after closing on Friday at 510.20.</p>
<p>"Demand is not visible and both Western and domestic investors are very calm," said Rinaco-Plus trader Valery Levit. "The market looks like it will ease under its own weight."</p>
<p>But national power company UES rose to $0.4285 at 1030 GMT from $0.4240, while oil company Yuganskneftegaz rose to $35.625 from $34.750, and some traders said the market could rise overall by close of trade.</p>
<p>They said the mid-morning announcement of the introduction of a new rouble, effective on January 1, 1998, which would be worth 1,000 old roubles, would not affect trade.</p>
<p>"It's completely unlinked," said Rossiisky Kredit Bank trader Andrei Girichev. "It is a totally technical thing -- just knocking off three zeroes at the end."</p>
<p>Traders said less-liquid second tier shares in the telecoms, energy, and chemical sectors were attracting interest, while light volumes and low activity in leading shares could be partly the result of Friday's 29-point dip in the Dow Jones industrial average.</p>
<p>"For stock with American Depositary Receipts the lower Dow Jones could be part of the reason," said Aton trader Boris Shvedsky.</p>
<p>Dealers predicted the market would remain quiet until the results of the tender of a 38 percent stake in metals producer Norilsk Nickel were announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The results of the auction will be very important," said Rinaco Plus's Levit.</p>
<p>"If it is successful and the price is high it could lead to a big spurt of action as the sale of (telecom holding company) Svyazinvest did. If the price is low it could have a depressive effect."</p>
<p>Russia's Uneximbank, which currently holds the shares under an agreement with the government, is organising the tender and is widely expected to win. Norilsk ordinary shares eased to $14.60 from $15.00.</p>
