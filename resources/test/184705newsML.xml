<p>Commodity trading giant Cargill said on Tuesday the first shipments of genetically-altered soybeans probably arrived at its Amsterdam plant ten days ago.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Dutch arm of U.S. trade house said the beans were delivered from an unspecified North American port on the freighter Amber, which arrived on November 2, to be crushed in the normal way, a process that takes a matter of hours.</p>
<p>"The modified beans could well have been in the shipment. The problem is that you just can't tell them apart," he said.</p>
<p>He added that the beans had already passed through the plant and had been delivered to clients.</p>
<p>He said the Cargill position on handling the new beans, developed by U.S. chemicals firm Monsanto to be resistant to its weedkiller Roundup, had not changed despite the recent blockades of European ports by environmental group Greenpeace.</p>
<p>"Our policy has always been that we do not transport beans that have not been properly tested," he said, adding the company believed them to be totally safe.</p>
<p>He also cited the regulatory approval of the new beans by medical authorities in the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>Greenpeace has launched a campaign against the new soybeans, saying they are a risky experiment with nature. The group has set up protests at Hamburg and Antwerp in attempts to stop imports.</p>
<p>The Cargill spokesman said that in the context of overall demand for meal and oil, there had been very little impact from the issue. Prices were yet to be affected, he said.</p>
<p>Some food groups in Europe, including the Unilever's unit in Germany where consumer fears are among the most widespread, have pledged not to use the Monsanto beans, even though they consider them safe. --David Evans, Amsterdam Newsroom +31 20 504 5000</p>
