<text>
<p>South African Justice Minister Dullah Omar on Monday published a draft law significantly extending judicial cooperation with foreign countries.</p>
<p>The 20-page "International Co-operation in Criminal Matters Bill" proposes to strengthen cooperation with foreign countries, most of which shunned South Africa's courts under apartheid.</p>
<p>It proposes to allow South African courts to request and offer cross-border assistance in taking evidence for criminal trials and in executing court orders.</p>
<p>The bill also seeks to make it easier for South Africa to cooperate with foreign countries in seizing and repatriating the proceeds of crime. One key element allows courts to freeze assets under certain circumstances.</p>
<p>The bill is due to be submitted to parliament for debate later this year.</p>
