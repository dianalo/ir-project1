<p>U.S. Treasury prices were little changed at the Tokyo midday on Tuesday as a wait-and-see mood prevailed ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting later in the day, traders said.</p>
<p>The dollar's sharp decline versus the yen this morning had no major impact on Treasury prices so far, while market sentiment remained mixed, they said.</p>
<p>"Despite the dollar's fall below 114 yen this morning, prices were generally steady. Operators were unwilling to take fresh positions until they see the Fed's decision on interest rates," a Japanese commercial bank trader said.  </p>
<p>The key 6-5/8 percent 30-year bond was unchanged from the New York close at 96-9/32, yielding 6.92 percent. Other prices also stuck near the previous closing levels.</p>
<p>The June T-bond futures contract fell 1/32 from the previous close to 109-28/32.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was split as to whether the Federal Reserve would tighten its federal funds rate further from the current 5.50 percnet.</p>
<p>"There is a 50/50 chance that the Fed will raise the federal funds rate, but there is also growing speculation that it will keep the rate unchanged," another trader said.</p>
