<headline>Second trial of ex-Nazi Priebke begins in Italy.</headline>
<dateline>ROME 1997-04-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>The second trial within a year of former SS captain Erich Priebke, accused of complicity in Italy's worst World War Two atrocity, started on Monday.</p>
<p>The 83-year old German was found guilty last August of involvement in the massacre of 335 men and boys in 1944 in the Ardeatine Caves south of Rome but was ordered released under a statute of limitation. The verdict, which sparked a storm of protest, was quashed on appeal and a retrial ordered.  </p>
<p>The trial began with preliminary procedures, including the presentation of lawyers. It is being heard by a military court but the venue has been moved to a heavily fortified civilian courtroom in a prison on Rome's outskirts.</p>
<p>Priebke, who was extradited from Argentina to Italy in November 1995, admits he shot two victims in the massacre, which included 75 Jews, but says he had to follow orders or be executed himself.</p>
<p>The shootings came as a reprisal for a partisan bomb attack in which 33 troops loyal to the Nazis died.</p>
<p>Priebke has been living in a monastery south of Rome since he was granted house arrest earlier this year.</p>
