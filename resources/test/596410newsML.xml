<p>South Korea's largest copper producer LG Metals Corp, a unit of LG Group, has borrowed $20 million from four banks to partially finance capacity expansion at its Onsan plant, the company said on Monday.</p>
<p>The company said in a statement it had borrowed the funds from Korea Exchange Bank's subsidiary in Ireland, Banque Indosuez, Fuji Bank and Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.</p>
<p>The company would repay the fund in a lump sum after five years at an interest rate of LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rates) plus 0.55 percent point, the statement said.  </p>
<p>The production capacity of refined copper in Onsan would reach 360,000 tonnes in 1998 after the expansion project is completed by the end of this year, compared to current 200,000 tonnes, an LG Metals official said.</p>
<p>Total cost of the expansion would be $300 million, the official said.</p>
<p>The official said the company's other plant in Changhang has an annual production capacity of 60,000 tonnes of refined copper.</p>
