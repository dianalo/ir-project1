<p>Cairn Energy USA Inc said Friday it expects development plans for hydrocarbon production on West Cameron Block 263, located in the Gulf of Mexico, to be ready early next year.</p>
<p>It said the West Cameron 263 No. 1 well, owned jointly with Enserch Exploration Inc encountered 51 feet of net pay based on wireline log analysis. This well, which was drilled in July, has been suspended pending development.</p>
<p>The second well on the block located about 50 miles off Lousiana's Cameron Parish, has been plugged and abandoned after being drilled into a separate structure, Cairn said.  </p>
<p>The company had a 50 percent working interest in the West Cameron 263 No. 2, while 25 percent each was held by Seagull Energy Corp and Enserch Exploration, which is 83 percent owned by ENSERCH Corp.</p>
<p>Cairn also said the East Cameron 331 A-12 well, in which it has a 40 percent working interest, was drilled to a depth of 11,800 feet and encountered 52 feet of net pay based on wireline log analysis.</p>
<p>The company said the well has been suspended and completion is expected to follow the drilling of the East Cameron 331 A-13 well in which it has a 20 percent working interest.</p>
<p>It said Noble Affiliates Inc's Samedan is operator of both East Cameron Block 331 wells with a 52.8 percent interest in A-12 and 70.4 percent in A-13, which is expected to start drilling early next week.</p>
<p>The remaining interests are held by  Continental Land and Fur, Cairn spokesman Munro Sutherland said.</p>
