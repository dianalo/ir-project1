<p>South African financial markets will be bombarded this week with a welter of economic indicators including key credit and money supply data, GDP growth numbers and inflation and trade figures.</p>
<p>First in line is the April trade figure, originally scheduled for last week, which will likely be released on Monday at 1200 GMT.</p>
<p>The average of eight forecasts collected predicted another surplus of around 900 million rand from a 1.98 billion rand surplus in March. Expectations are for continuing improvement on a rolling three-month basis as the pace of export growth picks up relative to that of imports, economists said.</p>
<p>The trade numbers will be followed on Wednesday at 1500 GMT by the Reserve Bank's closely watched money supply and private sector credit extension data.</p>
<p>The credit figure continues to be an important indicator for interest rates and came in lower-than-expected in March, fueling hope that the consumer credit binge was finally starting to fizzle out.</p>
<p>Eleven economists polled by Reuters on Friday forecast both April money supply and credit to climb, calling for a 16.7 percent year-on-year rise in money supply growth from a preliminary 16.39 percent increase in March.</p>
<p>Growth in credit extension was seen rising 16.4 percent from 15.96 percent previously.</p>
<p>The credit number would be pushed higher by technical factors, with the figure being calculated from a very low base month the previous year, economists said.</p>
<p>"The pace of consumer spending is slowing so you'll see a slowdown in the month-on-month rate of increase but because of the low base it is likely to increase on a year-on-year basis," said Rand Merchant Bank (RMB) treasury economist Julia Roy.</p>
<p>While there were signs that consumers were starting to borrow at a slower rate, economists said corporate credit demand remained strong.</p>
<p>On money supply, they said the figure would be held up by capital inflows on the balance of payments but more would depend on the credit demand side.</p>
<p>"Technical factors will again push the figure higher," one noted.</p>
<p>Also due out on Wednesday is the April inflation rate which is scheduled for 0900 GMT.</p>
<p>April will likely confirm that consumer inflation will peak below 10 percent, after much talk at the beginning of the year of the unfavourable spectre of double-digit inflation.</p>
<p>Economists polled forecast the consumer price index would remain flat from the March figure at 0.6 percent month-on-month or 9.6 percent year-on-year, the first dip in 11 months.</p>
<p>"The good news is that the April figure should either confirm that the 9.8 percent (year-on-year rise) in February was the peak or that, if the figure surprises on the high side, that will represent the peak," said RMB's Roy.</p>
<p>Sandra Gordon of Syfrets saw a peak of 0.8 percent month-on-month or 9.8 percent year-on-year in April with inflation expected to taper off to around 9.4 percent in May.</p>
<p>The last key number coming up on Thursday at 0730 GMT is first quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth.</p>
<p>The consensus was for GDP to rise a seasonally adjusted and annualised 2.5 percent in the first quarter from a 3.3 percent fourth quarter rise last year.</p>
<p>"Generally not a bad quarter and manufacturing production was very strong in the first quarter," said Nedcor's Dennis Dykes.</p>
<p>Consumer spending had held up mainly because of spending on durables, in particular motor cars, he said.</p>
<p>From the output point of view agriculture would still have done reasonably well while mining did relatively badly due to gold mining production coming off.</p>
<p>"But I think it's a bit deceptive and the second quarter is going to come off quite sharply with manufacturing starting to show signs of flagging out a bit after the rand induced boom," Dykes said.</p>
