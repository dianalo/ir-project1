<p>Italian Foreign Trade Minister Augusto Fantozzi said membership of the single European currency should not just be assessed from a monetary point of view but should also take into account a country's industrial weight.</p>
<p>"EMU membership should not just be assessed from a monetary point of view, It's not just an issue of parameters, it's also a question of the industrial system, the whole national system," he told reporters while attending a textile conference.</p>
<p>From this point of view Italy "is certainly in a much better position than some would have it appear," Fantozzi said.</p>
<p>Asked about reports of new European forecasts showing Italy would overshoot the EMU 3.0 percent deficit/GDP target despite its mini-budget, Fantozzi said "everyone's playing their own game and it's right that they should do so.</p>
<p>"Everyone has their own opinion and probably seen from abroad Italy may sometimes appear fragile from a monetary point of view," he said.</p>
<p>"We have to go our own way, and this is exactly what we are doing with serious supplementary budget measures which have been acknowledged as such by international organisations," he said.</p>
<p>Fantozzi said the government should also make sure the 1998 budget law contained structural intervention on the welfare state "which will allow us to keep to the stability pact we have signed up to." -- Milan newsroom +392 66129589</p>
