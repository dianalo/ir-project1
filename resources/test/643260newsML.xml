<p>CME pork bellies tumbled for limit losses late and finished off sharply to limit down as fund liquidation added carryover selling and weakness in cash product. Hogs ended mixed on fund rolling, traders said.</p>
<p>Pork bellies closed 3.000 to 2.000 cents per lb lower with March down the daily limit. July finished 2.750 lower at 84.500 after taking limit down late.</p>
<p>Hog futures ended up 0.175 to off 0.800 with June up 0.100 at 81.125 cents. July was off 0.450 at 81.350 and August the only other month up. Next year August and October contracts posted new contract lows as deferreds continued to fall.</p>
<p>Pork belly futures ranged sharply on both sides of previous levels early but turned down as weakness in cash product added to further fund liquiation, they said.</p>
<p>"I think it was a technical breakdown spurred by weak cash," said John Fischer, partner in Skylane Trading.</p>
<p>The larger pace of slaughter and resistance to the high cash prices weighed on the cash market. Packers lowered asking prices Thursday when their offers over $90 per cwt lacked any interest and actual cash prices turned lower Friday. USDA reported cash bellies off $1 to $4 at noon, traders added.  </p>
<p>Prudential Securities, ING and Refco bought on the early rally before selling by locals and late pressure from Cargill Investor Services, E.D.&amp;F. Man and LIT division of First Options took prices down to seven-week lows, pit sources said.</p>
<p>Late fund rolling made for mixed prices in nearby hog futures. June was supported by strong cash ideas for next week but the 'Goldman roll' pressured July while boosting August up for a net gain in the closing minutes. Goldman Sachs resumed their fund rolling after starting earlier than expected on Wednesday. Rolling should continue early next week, traders said.</p>
<p>Continued tight hog supplies should support cash markets much of next week despite some resistance showing in cash pork products after gains earlier in the week. But weakness may also continue to deferred months on the longer term outlook for increased hog supplies, they said.</p>
<p>Expectations are that the pig crop report later in the month will show increased hog supplies going into next year on stepped up breeding, traders said.</p>
<p>Rand Financials and ING notably bought July and Rand bought August early before the spreading of long August/short July by Refco and Cargill weighed on July. In hog options, First Chicago sold August 78 puts and October 70 puts. June volatility was under pressure, pit sources said.</p>
