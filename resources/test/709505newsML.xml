<p>The Italian government, flushed with the success of its recent initiatives to boost car sales, is considering introducing incentives to encourage the country's depressed building sector.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco and Industry Minister Pierluigi Bersani were both quoted as saying on Sunday that the government planned to intervene to help the sector.</p>
<p>"The incentives won't be extravagent but they will be important," Visco said.</p>
<p>Newspapers said any incentive schemes would be included in the 1998 budget, which has to be unveiled by the end of September 1997. Among measures being studied are a reduction in value added tax on building work.</p>
<p>The building sector was badly hit by the wave of corruption scandals which washed over Italy in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Many public work projects ground to a halt or were simply cancelled as magistrates investigated claims that construction firms paid politicians huge kickbacks to win contracts.</p>
<p>Constructors association Ance has asked the government to cut taxes on building work and on people buying first houses in a bid to kick start the flagging industry.</p>
<p>Italy's centre-left government introduced incentives at the start of the year to encourage people to scrap their old cars and buy new ones.</p>
<p>The scheme has led to a huge jump in car sales, with analysts estimating that the Treasury has actually made some 600 billion lire ($353 million) because of the increased sales.</p>
