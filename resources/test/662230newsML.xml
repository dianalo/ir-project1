<p>Moody's Investors Service said on Monday it had confirmed the senior unsecured debt ratings of Boral Ltd and its guaranteed subsidiaries at A2 and the company's commercial paper rating at Prime-1.  </p>
<p>The confirmation follows Boral's announcement that it plans to float off its gas distribution networks in South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory.</p>
<p>Boral said it expected the float of Envestra Ltd to raise more than A$850 million. It plans to retain a 19.9 percent stake in the company.</p>
<p>Moody's said it expected Boral would use the proceeds at first to reduce leverage and in the medium term to boost growth in the core businesses.</p>
