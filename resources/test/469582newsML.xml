<p>Motorola Inc has repeated that it expects a year-over-year decline in quarterly earnings to persist until later this year despite a modest recovery in its key semiconductor business.</p>
<p>"Although we don't anticipate positive quarter-to-quarter earnings comparisons (versus the year-earlier periods) until later in 1997, we are well into the process of improving the performance of our existing businesses, as well as building on our future technology portfolio to create new business segments," top executives said in a letter to shareholders included in Motorola's recently published 1996 annual report.  </p>
<p>The technology company's 1996 earnings fell to $1.15 billion, or $1.90 per fully diluted share, from $1.78 billion, or $2.93, the previous year.</p>
<p>In a letter signed by Chief Executive Christopher Galvin, President and Chief Operating officer Robert Growney and Chairman Gary Tooker, Motorola said the main reason for the decline in earnings and a slowdown in sales was the recession in the semiconductor industry.  </p>
<p>Other factors included product deficiencies in certain segments of Motorola's cellular telephone and modem businesses, slower sales in the U.S. paging business in the fourth quarter and the related impact on sales of components such as rechargeable batteries, the company said.</p>
<p>"As the year ended, we began to see signs of improvement in our semiconductor business as the industry cycle turns up, and in our cellular phone business as a result of introducing leadership digital phone product in the third and fourth quarters," the letter said.  </p>
<p>Motorola took fourth-quarter charges of more than $150 million to cover reductions in its workforce and other cost-cutting measures. Capital expenditures, especially in the semiconductor area, were deferred, the company said.</p>
<p>In a year-end news release, Motorola said it expected only gradual sequential quarterly improvement in semiconductor sales and earnings. And despite a "promising" long-term outlook for Motorola's communications business, the recovery there was also expected to be modest.</p>
<p>In addition, the company said at year-end it did not expect an overall return to increased profits versus 1996 until later this year.</p>
<p>"(M)any of the factors that affected certain of our businesses should continue to have an adverse impact in early 1997," the company said.</p>
