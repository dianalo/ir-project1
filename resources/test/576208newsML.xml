<title>USA: Emerging markets debt rallies in thin trading.</title>

<p>Brady debt rose in very thin trading Monday, following U.S. fixed-income markets higher, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>"We started out this morning weak, where (Brady) bonds were getting hit," one trader said. "Firmness in the Treasury market basically stopped our downtrade and we started to see dealers coming back in and lifting things."</p>
<p>Yield spreads improved, on average, from about five basis points wider near the U.S. open to about five basis points tighter in late trading, market experts said.  </p>
<p>"But it doesn't mean very much on a day like today -- volume is almost non-existent," a Brady trader said.</p>
<p>Major Latin issuers performed about equally well. Argentina FRBs  were up 1/4 at 92-1/2 bid, and Brazil C bonds  up 5/8 at 77-1/2 bid. Mexico pars were up 1/2 at 74-1/4 bid.</p>
<p>Bulgaria IABs  posted the most impressive gain of the session, up a full point at 65-3/4. Traders attributed the improvement to a report the country's consumer prices fell 0.7 percent in April after a 12.3-percent rise the month before.  </p>
<p>U.S. interest-rate expectations continued to drive trading and were almost solely responsible for the narrowing of spreads over the past week, analysts said.</p>
<p>"The markets in general have ruled out a move on the 20th," said Richard Segal, director of fixed-income research at Santander Investments. "The aggressive purchasing of both Brady bonds and bonds in the new-issue market suggests there are few fears regarding what might happen in the U.S. economy."  </p>
<p>U.S. investors have made similarly aggressive moves, Segal said. "The premium of the (federal) funds future over fed funds is only six basis points," he said.</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee convenes May 20 to decide whether to raise short-term rates again. In contrast with market sentiment, most U.S. economists in a Reuters poll Friday projected another 25-basis-point increase.</p>
<p>Emerging debt will look to reports on U.S. retail sales, consumer prices and producer prices later this week for more clues about the future of U.S. rates, traders said.</p>
<p>"Any one of (the releases) that misses the mark is going to have a big impact," one trader said. "People are looking for an excuse to try to move the market in their direction."</p>
