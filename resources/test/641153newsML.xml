<p>CBOT wheat futures were expected to open one to two cents per bushel lower on Thursday, mostly under pressure from slow export sales, traders said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture put net old and new crop wheat sales at 423,600 tonnes. That estimate fell below trade expectations for sales of 500,000 to 700,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Early samples from the ongoing hard red winter wheat harvest in Texas indicate high quality characteristics despite a high moisture content.</p>
<p>Forecasts from the International Grains Council were also seen as slightly bearish for wheat, floor traders said.</p>
<p>IGC slashed its estimate for Chinese wheat imports by three million tonnes to four million for 1997/98.</p>
