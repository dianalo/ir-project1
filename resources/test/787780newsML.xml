<p>Hong Kong's government has revealed a proposal to replace a frozen law that gives workers the right to collective bargaining, local radio reported on Friday.</p>
<p>Under the proposal, a special unit would be established within the government's Labour Department to promote collective bargaining on a voluntary basis, the report quoted a senior labour official as saying.</p>
<p>The proposal contrasts with the frozen law, which requires employers to enter collective bargaining with unions on pay packages.</p>
<p>The proposed special unit would advise individual employers and companies on the merits of collective bargaining, the radio said.</p>
<p>The official was quoted as saying the administration would present the proposal to a labour advisory board that is studying a number of frozen labour rights laws, including that on collective bargaining.</p>
<p>The board will discuss the laws against next Monday, radio said.</p>
<p>Last month, the legislature endorsed a bill freezing until October laws on collective barraging, use of trade union funds and anti-union discrimination by employers.</p>
<p>The government said the labour rights laws had been passed with "indecent haste" in the last days of British rule and needed careful review.</p>
<p>The suspension, ostensibly on the grounds that the new laws may hurt Hong Kong's competitiveness, sparked an uproar among local pro-democracy unions and labour groups worldwide.</p>
