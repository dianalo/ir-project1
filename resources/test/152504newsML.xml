<p>U.S. stock index futures ended mostly lower after a session pressured by a bond retreat and profit-taking from Tuesday's gains.</p>
<p>December Standard and Poor's 500 futures finished just above the session low set late in the day. Volume was brisk.</p>
<p>Traders said once December's mid-afternoon push to 706.20 failed, dealer selling and profit-taking hit the market.</p>
<p>"Once it was obvious they weren't going to be able to hold 703.00 a lot of bigger houses turned sellers," an S&amp;P 500 trader said. "It's a very finicky market, " he said.</p>
<p>Traders blamed shaky bonds and pre-jobs report jitters.  </p>
<p>December Treasury bond futures soared to a fresh seven-month high at 113-13/32 early in the session after third-quarter growth data, but were undermined by new home sales later. T-bonds never recovered, and mild early gains in stock index futures failed.</p>
<p>Traders pointed to nervousness amid a slew of reports today and before key employment data on Friday.</p>
<p>Before stocks opened, third-quarter gross domestic product was reported up 2.2 percent, higher than the 1.8 percent forecast, but lower than second quarter growth of 4.7 percent.  </p>
<p>September new home sales fell 0.5 percent to a annual 816,000 from a revised 820,000 level in August. Still, traders had been expecting a much weaker number, yanking T-bonds from their highs which in turn kept a lid on S&amp;Ps, traders said.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve's "beige book" of economic activity had little impact on the market. Traders said once through the earlier data, the focus turned to Friday's payrolls data. September jobs were seen up 212,000 from a 40,000 drop in August. The unemployment rate was forecast to remain steady at 5.2 percent.  </p>
<p>At settlement, December S&amp;Ps were down 3.45 points at 702.80, Value Lines fell 0.60 points to 642.50, Nikkei 225 lost 345.0 to 20,620.0, Midcap 400s rose 0.30 to 242.50, and NYSE Composite fell 1.65 points to 373.75. -Derivatives Desk(312)408-8750/E-mail:derivatives@reuters.com</p>
