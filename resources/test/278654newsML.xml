<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan dollar ends lower on year-end demand.</title>
<headline>Taiwan dollar ends lower on year-end demand.</headline>

<p>The Taiwan dollar closed slightly down on Friday on importers' year-end demand for the U.S. currency, but dealers did not expect sharp movements before the end of 1996.</p>
<p>The local unit finished at an intra-day low of T$27.501 against Thursday's T$27.498 close. Turnover through dealers was an active US$215.5 milion.</p>
<p>The U.S. dollar's strength overseas also triggered greenback buying, but dealers said the Taiwan dollar's downtrend was offset by exporters' willingness to sell their U.S. dollar position.  </p>
<p>"It is quite obvious that the market's demand and supply for the U.S. dollar remain fairly balanced. The trading range will remain narrow until the end of the year," said one dealer at a foreign bank.</p>
<p>A range of T$27.49-51 was seen for Saturday.</p>
