<p>The Australian government said on Wednesday that new carriers entering the telecommunications industry next year will need to have local content plans.</p>
<p>Industry minister John Moore said that from July 1 next year, when the telecoms sector is deregulated, new carriers will be required under licensing provisions to have an industry plan covering proposed involvement with Australian-based suppliers.</p>
<p>"On this matter, I will make decisions on exemptions from the industry plan requirements on a case-by-case basis," he said in a speech to a telecommunications conference.  </p>
<p>Moore said major international suppliers would continue to be encouraged to join the government's partnership for development programme or fixed term arrangement programmmes.</p>
<p>He also said the government would establish a new independent monitoring body to oversee the industry from July next year, replacing the existing Telecommunications Industry Development Authority.</p>
<p>"Over the next few months I will consider the nature and composition of the body which will provide advice on the continued growth of Australian industries during this time of dramatic change."  </p>
