<p>A House of Representatives subcommittee chairman said on Tuesday he feared a White House panel investigating Gulf War illnesses had not consulted enough sources outside the government, rendering its upcoming report "practically meaningless."</p>
<p>President Bill Clinton has pledged to find the cause of illnesses afflicting U.S. troops who fought against Iraq in the 1991 war. The panel he named to investigate, the Presidential Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses, is expected to hand in its report by Dec. 31.</p>
<p>But Representative Christopher Shays, a Connecticut Republican whose subcommittee has held hearings on the mysterious illnesses, said he had seen drafts of the report and it relied too much on official sources that found no link between the illnesses and exposure to biological or chemical weapons.</p>
<p>"The fact is, we've spoken to many veterans who basically have had no contact with this commission," Shays told Reuters. "Whatever this panel says, if they have come to conclusions without interacting closely with our veterans and seeking outside sources other than the CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) or the DOD (Department of Defence), this report is going to be practically meaningless."</p>
<p>The chairwoman of the presidential panel, Joyce Lashof, defended its upcoming report, while declining to discuss its content before it is released. "Our investigation was broad. We did not limit ourselves to government agencies," said Lashoff,  a former dean of the School of Public Health at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
<p>Lashof said from her home in California that the commission had heard from veterans all over the country through the Internet and "I think we've done a very thorough job." She said the document would be handed in by Dec. 31 and she expected it would become public once Clinton had a chance to read it.</p>
<p>The Pentagon has said it has found no common cause of widespread complaints from Gulf War veterans and there is no evidence of U.S. deaths or injuries from chemical agents or of Iraqi use of them agaisnt U.S. forces.</p>
<p>But it also said in October it was notifying about 20,000 Gulf War veterans that they might have been exposed to chemical weapons when American troops destroyed the Kamisiyah weapons dump in southern Iraq in March 1991.</p>
<p>Shays, whose subcommittee on Human Resources and Intergovernmental Relations has been holding hearings on Gulf War illnesses as part of its oversight over the Veterans' Administration, said he would ask Jonathan Tucker, a former chemical weapons investigator who was dismissed a year ago by the White House panel, to testify to his subcommittee next month.</p>
<p>Tucker, who now works at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in California, believes he was dismissed on Dec. 1, 1995 because he went outside normal government channels to investigate illnesses. "I got clear orders that I was not to speak to veterans' groups or whistle blowers," he said, and after he did he was given an hour to clean out his desk.</p>
<p>Tucker is appealing for a deeper investigation into possible Iraqi biological weapons use at the Saudi port of Al-Jubayl during the Gulf War. He said an explosion at the port on Jan. 19, 1991 provided the best-documented link between toxic exposure and Gulf War illnesses.</p>
<p>He said a large proportion of the U.S. forces who were exposed to a "mysterious attack" at Al-Jubayl have developed chronic symptoms considered typical of Gulf War illnesses. These included severe fatigue, joint aches, memory loss, mysterious gastrointestinal ailments and skin rashes.</p>
