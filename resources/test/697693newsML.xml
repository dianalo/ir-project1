<p>SIMEX Nikkei stock index futures ended a shade higher on Monday but buying was sluggish on concerns over the pace of Japan's economic recovery, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Although the (recent) tankan was reassuring, there is a lingering concern Japan's economic recovery might be a bit slow," a dealer with a Japanese institution said.</p>
<p>After hitting a high of 20,680 in the morning, September Nikkei contract settled at 20,555, up 20 points from Friday. Volume was light, at 7,390 lots.  </p>
<p>"I expect we will see more volumes in SIMEX but the volatility will still be there because this market is very speculative," he said.</p>

<p>The MSCI Taiwan stock index for July shed 1.7 points to settled at 384.60, shrugging off the seven year high close on Taipei's stock market on Monday.</p>
<p>"SIMEX has been moving up the past weeks and have priced in most of the bullishness," said a local dealer.</p>
<p>He said news that Taiwan's Securities and Futures Commission would lift a ban on local trading of offshore Taiwan stock index futures in Singapore and Chicago from August 1, 1997, was in line with expectations.</p>
