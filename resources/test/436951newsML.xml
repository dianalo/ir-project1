<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss bond market closing report.</title>
<headline>Swiss bond market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1997-03-12</dateline>

<p>Swiss bonds weakened again, extending price declines which have taken the March Confederate Bond futures contract down from record levels at the start of the month back towards mid-February lows.</p>
<p>One bond trader at a leading Swiss bank said the selling was determined at least in part by futures, where an estimated 9,000 contracts changed hands. Some of the volume was linked to rollover into the June contract. The March confederate bond contract will expire March 17. Dealers also wondered whether one Swiss bank which was reported to have sold aggressively last week was selling again today.  </p>
<p>Swiss bonds slipped versus Bunds. The 10-year yield spread has narrowed to 209 basis points from over 220 last week.</p>
<p>Traders also cited higher swap rates, which rose as money market rates rose. Traders believe the rise in money market rates is only technical ahead of the end of the bank liquidity period and quarter end. The Swiss National Bank's addition of overnight liquidity at 2.00 percent on Wednesday was above recent additions at 1-13/16 percent for one month, traders noted. But SNB president Hans Meyer said Tuesday night in Frankfurt the central bank was sticking by its current policy and would consider changes when they were appropriate.  </p>
<p>-- Wednesday's closing prices as follows:</p>
<p>March Conf futures down 54 at 120.60.</p>
<p>March Comi medium-term bond down 25 at 112.00</p>
<p>Mar Euro Swiss francs down two at 98.07.</p>
<p>4-1/2 Jun 2007 bond = 107.70/80 yield 3.58 pct</p>
<p>(Tuesday 108.40/50 yield 3.486 pct)</p>
