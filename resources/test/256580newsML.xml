<p>Tokyo shares tumbled in choppy trading on Friday, with a sharp drop on Wall Street overnight casting a long shadow over the market.</p>
<p>The stock market fall triggered some morning losses in Japanese government bonds, but there was no major spill-over effect for the dollar, which remained steady at around 113.20 yen and 1.5420 marks, near its overnight levels.</p>
<p>The Nikkei average of 225 leading shares briefly fell more than 500 points, or 2.5 percent, in hectic morning trade to about 19,987. It was the first time the index had been below the key 20,000 level in three months.</p>
<p>The Nikkei then stabilised and at the midday close was down 350.57 points at 20,150.63, a loss of 1.71 percent.</p>
<p>"Due to the New York sell-off, we can't hope for foreign investors' buying in Tokyo. That dampened the Nikkei average," said Harushige Kobayashi, deputy general manager at Yamaichi Securities Co Ltd.</p>
<p>The Tokyo market has been supported recently by foreign investors' purchases of blue-chip issues.</p>
<p>The Nikkei last sank below the 20,000 level on September 3 this year, when it marked an intraday low of 19,920.02.</p>
<p>New York blue-chip shares fell nearly 100 points or 1.54 percent on Thursday after a late burst of computerised programme selling in what was a roller-coaster session. This was the Dow's biggest point loss since mid-July and followed a 71-point drop on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Stock markets around the globe have been nervous since Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan talked about the possibility of equity markets moving too high.</p>
<p>Speaking a week ago, the head of the U.S. central bank said that "irrational exuberance" could be affecting the markets.</p>
<p>World markets were also unsettled this week by fears that Japanese investors may be turning away from U.S. Treasuries, which would push up U.S. interest rates and hurt Wall Street stock prices.</p>
<p>The latest Nikkei fall dragged down Japanese government bonds (JGB), but institutional selling was not as strong as some market participants feared.</p>
<p>"The fall in share prices has given birth to speculation that profit-taking selling of JGBs will emerge," said a trader at a city bank's securities affiliate.</p>
<p>Key March JGB futures were down 0.13 point at 124.76 by noon on Friday.</p>
<p>Akio Makabe, an assistant general manager for Daiichi-Kangyo Bank, said: "The current weakness of the stocks is a minus factor for the (yen bond) market."</p>
<p>Currency traders, meanwhile, said they saw little or no impact from the Nikkei drop.</p>
