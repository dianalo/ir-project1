<p>GTE Corp said that as of midnight EDT (0400 GMT) on June 9, about 95.78 percent of all outstanding shares of BBN Corp were validly tendered and not withdrawn.</p>
<p>The company said that its cash tender offer for BBN shares has now expired. The 95.78 percent represents about 21,395,837 shares.</p>
<p>GTE said it would buy the Internet service provider for $616 million or $29 a share in early May.</p>
<p>In the second step of the acquisition, BBN will be merged with GTE Massachusetts and become a wholly owned unit of GTE. Each BBN shares not previously purchased in the tender offer will be converted into the right to receive $29 in cash, without interest.</p>
<p>GTE said the merger will be completed as soon as practicable following a meeting of BBN stockholders. It added that because GTE owns shares representing more than two-thirds of the voting power of the outstanding BBN stock, the consummation of the merger is assured.</p>
