<title>USA: Maine term limits law struck down by federal judge.</title>
<headline>Maine term limits law struck down by federal judge.</headline>

<p>A federal judge on Monday struck down a Maine law that requires candidates to pledge support for congressional term limits or be branded on the ballot as "violated voter instructions."</p>
<p>U.S. District Court Judge Morton Brody said the law was an unconstitutional attempt to coerce candidates by punishing opponents of term limits with a ballot label voters might find objectionable.</p>
<p>The law approved by voters in 1996 requires congressional, legislative and gubernatorial candidates to actively support an amendment to the U.S. Constitution that would limit members of the U.S. House to three terms and senators to two terms.</p>
<p>Brody said that because of the coercive nature of the law, legislators "cannot act in the deliberative and independent manner required by Article V of the Constitution."</p>
<p>John Michael, who directed the campaign for the Maine law, said "the law merely identifies for the voters which politicians declined the voters' request."</p>
<p>Nine states approved similar laws in 1996, and most have been challenged in the courts. Michael predicted that the issue would go to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
