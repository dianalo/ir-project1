<p>BET Holdings Inc hopes to open a 1,000-room hotel and casino with Hilton Hotels Corp on or near the Las Vegas Strip by 1999 and is looking at several sites, the company's president and chief operating officer told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The progress is that we are looking at sites in Las Vegas," said Debra Lee in an interview.</p>
<p>Hilton and BET announced late last year they formed a joint venture to explore the feasability of opening a Las Vegas hotel and casino.  </p>
<p>"The feasability study is complete, we have board authorization, and we are looking for sites that are close to the Strip," Lee said adding that the company would "love to" have the project open before the end of 1999.</p>
<p>Lee said the company had not yet completed any arrangements with lenders and details of how the joint venture would be structured had not yet been worked out.  She said a name for the casino hotel had not been decided upon yet, although it would probably include the Hilton and BET names.</p>
<p>BET chairman Robert Johnson received a casino license from the Nevada Gaming commission about a month ago.  </p>
<p>BET, owner of the Black Entertainment Television cable network, said the project will be targeted toward serving the 2.2 million African-American visitors to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>BET Holdings Inc also said Friday it approved plans to significantly expand its theme restaurant chain, BET SoundStage, by authorizing the opening of up to 20 additional restaurants nationwide during the next five years.</p>
<p>The company said the first BET SoundStage Restaurant located in Largo, Md., a suburb of Washington, D.C., has experienced strong sales since its opening in January of 1997.</p>
<p>In addition a new BET SoundStage Club is slated to open in early 1998 at the Pleasure Island component of Walt Disney Co's Walt Disney World resort complex in Orlando, Fla.</p>
<p>Targeted towards African-American viewers, the BET network is currently seen in more than 50 million cable households nationwide, as reported by Nielsen Media Research.</p>
