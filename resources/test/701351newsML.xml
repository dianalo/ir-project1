<title>UK: European duty-paid zinc premiums spike up.</title>
<headline>European duty-paid zinc premiums spike up.</headline>

<p>Physical premiums for duty-paid zinc have shot up dramatically in Europe over the past two weeks although at higher levels business has thinned out, physical traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Premiums over London Metal Exchange (LME) cash in Rotterdam were being quoted at $50/$55, with one trader citing business at $55. Just two weeks ago, the premium was closer to $30/$35.</p>
<p>"My feeling is someone was aggressively bidding it up to that level -- either a consumer who needed material and was short covering before the summer period, or else someone with a major interest in getting premiums up," a trader said.</p>
<p>"One day it quoted at $30/$35 and then we heard someone paid $50 for two-three lots, just to have the number," another said.</p>
<p>Prices were also high in the European currencies, with the dollar at a 40-month peak against the mark.</p>
<p>Duty-paid zinc was not readily available in any large quantities in Rotterdam, while total LME stocks were down 1,475 tonnes at 411,625 tonnes on Wednesday, traders said.</p>
<p>"There is not that much freely available duty-paid material. Interested parties seem to be holding it back," a trader said. "It takes more than a phone call or two to get decent quantities together. I think someone is sitting on it," he added.</p>
<p>Demand has declined with the soaring cost of physical metal, several traders said. The cash price for zinc was around $1,450, roughly $100 higher than a month ago.</p>
<p>"With the cash price up and premiums high, business isn't outrageous. But demand is there and I'm sure when the market comes off a bit buying will step in," one said.</p>
<p>Another said demand currently was more or less hand to mouth, with consumers buying on small price dips.</p>
<p>"I think this will all end in tears. If the price reaches $1,500 everyone will open their doors to deliver to the LME. There are also indications that some Eastern bloc countries are holding deliverable stock," he added.</p>
<p>One trader also speculated that if the cash/threes contango -- currently at $6/$3 -- narrowed further below the cost of financing then warrant holders may drop premiums to get rid of the metal.</p>
<p>European producers were generally said to be running fully sold books: "It's only when we can squeeze out an extra 100 tonnes or if someone doesn't take 25 tonnes for a certain reason for a week or so that it frees things up a bit," a trader said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile duty-unpaid material was being quoted at a premium of $20/$25, while CIS material ranged from a discount of $5/$10 for medium sized parcels to level for smaller amounts.</p>
