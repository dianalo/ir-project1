<p>A Sikh party was poised on Monday to rule India's Punjab state for the next five years after a landslide victory in the farming region's first peaceful elections in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>The Akali Dal, led by former chief minister Prakash Singh Badal, and its ally the rightwing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won an overwhelming four-fifths of the 117 seats in the state legislature.</p>
<p>"The Hindus dominate the cities. The BJP is their major mouthpiece. Sikhs dominate the countryside. The combination is formidable," said Ashis Nandy, an analyst at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies in New Delhi.</p>
<p>It was a significant win for the Sikh party, which won a dominant 74 seats after boycotting the last Punjab elections in 1992. The state's ruling Congress party was reduced to a humiliating also-ran with only 14 seats.</p>
<p>"This is a sweeping victory, a good result from unprecedented peaceful polls," Punjab's chief electoral officer Brajendra Singh told Reuters.</p>
<p>"I would like to concede victory to the Akali Dal," Congress general secretary Ghulam Nabi Azad told state-run Doordarshan television. "We may have lost, but democracy has won."</p>
<p>Election officials noted that a strong 69 percent of the state's 15 million voters had turned out for Friday's polls, in sharp contrast with 1992 when a scant 22 percent voted in an election overshadowed by Sikh separatist violence.</p>
<p>"It is a historic win at a historic moment for Punjab. It signals an era of peace and prosperity," Akali Dal spokesman Kanwaljit Singh told Reuters.</p>
<p>A rival, pro-separatist faction of the Akali Dal won just one seat in Monday's final tally. Its leader, former police official turned militant Simranjit Singh Mann, was defeated.</p>
<p>State officials said the 69-year-old Badal was expected to take office as Punjab's chief minister later this week.</p>
<p>The rich farming region bordering Pakistan was roiled by years of guerrilla violence that peaked in June 1984 when the army attacked Sikhdom's holiest shrine, the Golden Temple, to flush out militants holed up there.</p>
<p>Four months later then prime minister Indira Gandhi was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards and India's capital Delhi was rocked by anti-Sikh rioting.</p>
<p>Sikh-Hindu ties frayed as the militants pursued their goal of a separate Sikh homeland called Khalistan, but the revolt was put down by a harsh security crackdown. Nearly 20,000 people died in the violence.</p>
<p>Analysts said the Akali Dal's poll alliance with the BJP offered Sikhs and Hindus a chance to overcome the distrust.</p>
<p>"The Akalis never encouraged militancy. They were soft on the militants. The militancy was the handiwork of groups which were opposed to the Akalis," Nandy said.</p>
<p>Kanwaljit Singh, a former interior minister, underlined the new mood of reconciliation, saying the Akali Dal had shifted its focus from the welfare of the state's majority Sikhs to friendship with its minority Hindus.</p>
<p>"Hindus may be in a minority in Punjab, but we have realised that the state cannot progress without their total involvement in its governance," he said.</p>
