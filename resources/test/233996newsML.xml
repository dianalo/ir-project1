<p>ANGER OVER HIGHER UNIVERSITY FEES</p>
<p>With the support of independent senators Brian Harradine and Mal Colston, the Senate last night passed the government's proposals for higher university fees.</p>
<p>Democrats senator, Natasha Stott-Despoja says she believes the pair was swayed by the Education Minister Senator Amanda Vanstone when she said university operating grants would be cut even further if the Senate didn't pass the proposals.</p>
<p>Senator Stott-Despoja says students have been sold out in a climate of fear, anxiety and blackmail.</p>
<p>The National Union of Students says it'll maintain the rage over the hike in fees by staging a long term campaign to try to make the education system more accessible and equitable.</p>

<p>DOCTOR DISGUSTED IN DEATH CERTIFICATE DELAY</p>
<p>The doctor of the first man to die using the Northern Territory's voluntary euthanasia law, says he's disgusted by the delay in the issuing of the death certificate.</p>
<p>The Office of the Coroner in Darwin says it can now proceed with issuing a death certificate for Bob Dent, who received a lethal injection in September.</p>
<p>The delay has concerned Doctor Philip Nitschke and Mr Dent's family.</p>
<p>The ABC has received a letter from the Territory's Deputy Coroner, confirming that until now, the cause of Mr Dent's death has been officially "unknown", pending an investigation.</p>
<p>The delay is blamed on the coroner not receiving certain documents from Dr Nitschke until a month ago, but Dr Nitschke says the process was simple enough not to have taken this long.</p>
