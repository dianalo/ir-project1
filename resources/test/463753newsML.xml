<p>Dutch shares closed lower on Monday with Tuesday's U.S. Federal Reserve Open Market (FOMC) meeting spreading a nervous sentiment in the market.</p>
<p>Dealers said an early index-linked futures sell-off had put pressure on the Dutch share market.</p>
<p>The AEX share index hit a low of 710.87 in morning trade. The index closed 12.08 points lower at 715.22.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow (after the FOMC meeting) it will probably be clear in what direction the market will be heading in the near-term," said one dealer.</p>
<p>Dutch chartists were very much divided on the direction.  </p>
<p>Some chartists said the Dutch index was likely to fall further after last week's correction, while another chartist said that the share market was heavily oversold and would bounce up again.</p>
<p>Financial stocks were hit on interest rate worries today with bank-insurer Fortis Amev showing the largest drop, down 3.8 percent or 2.70 guilders, at 68.90.</p>
<p>Fortis Amev will publish its 1996 results on Wednesday and analysts have forecast a rise in net profits of over 16 percent to around 806 million guilders.  </p>
<p>Financial services group ING was 1.90 guilders lower at 69.20 and ABN AMRO Bank fell 2.00 guilders to 124.70.</p>
<p>The market is expecting a rise of the U.S. interest rate, but the main worry is whether it will have an impact on rates in Europe as well.</p>
<p>"An increase in U.S. rates might prompt a move in Germany as it would push the dollar higher versus the German mark and other European currencies," said one dealer.</p>
<p>"The German Bundesbank has said that they would not be very happy with a rate hike in the U.S. so the market fears a rate move in Germany as well because of this," said one dealer.  </p>
<p>Temporary employment agency Randstad, which will publish its 1996 annual report on Tuesday, outperformed the market by far, rising 7.90 guilders to 146.50.</p>
<p>Philips Electronics, which was trading ex-dividend today, dipped 2.30 guilders to 80.70. The 1996 dividend was set at 1.60 guilders per share.</p>
<p>Reed Elsevier announced today it planned a $320 million public offer for U.S. MDL Information Systems. The group said MDL would make a positive contribution to earnings from 1998.</p>
<p>Elsevier shares closed 10 cents lower at 28.80 in heavy volume.  </p>
<p>Dutch supermarket group Ahold dipped 5.20 guilders to 128.10 after investment bank Goldman Sachs cut Ahold to market performer from market outperformer.</p>
