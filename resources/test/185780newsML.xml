<p>Nigeria's four refineries are now operating at 75 percent of their installed capacity, a senior oil ministry official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Our refineries are improving in operations and the average performance is 75 percent in capacity," Wilson Dublin-Green, director of petroleum resources, told reporters in Lagos.</p>
<p>He said the country's biggest refinery in southeastern Port-Harcourt recorded the highest level of performance, hitting 80 percent level of its 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) capacity.</p>
<p>"But we have insisted that the quality of operation should be more than that."</p>
<p>Poor management and lack of funds to buy spare parts for repairs had reduced production level of the four refineries to about a third of their combined total capacity of 445,000 bpd in the first half of this year.</p>
