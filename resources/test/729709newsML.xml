<p>European Union antitrust experts will meet on Wednesday to discuss again the proposed merger between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, an EU source said.</p>
<p>He said talks between Boeing and the European Commission on how the merger could win EU regulatory approval ended on Tuesday and that the U.S. aerospace giant had not improved its offer.  </p>
<p>"Negotiations are over," the source said. Asked whether Boeing had improved the offer, he said: "It's obvious that they have not".</p>
<p>Antitrust experts from the 15 EU states agreed unanimously at a first meeting on the $14 billion merger on July 4 that the deal could not be allowed if the Commission's competition concerns were not addressed.</p>
<p>The Commission's tough stance on the merger between the two U.S. aircraft makers, which could culminate with a straight prohibition of the deal on July 23, raises the spectre of a damaging transtlantic dispute.</p>
<p>The Federal Trade Commission of the United States cleared the merger earlier this month without conditions and U.S. vice president Al Gore has warned that the Clinton administration would take action to prevent the deal being blocked by the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission fears the deal will strengthen Boeing's dominant position in the civil aviation market, increasing its customer base to 84 percent from 60 percent. -- Brussels Newsroom 32 2 287 6800</p>
