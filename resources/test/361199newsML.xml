<p>The European Court of Justice said on Thursday Belgium had failed to enact EU safety standards for new liquid and gas fueled hot-water boilers on time.</p>
<p>In its defence Belgium told the court draft texts were ready, but "delays in their entry into force are attributable to the complexity of the applicable institutional rules."</p>
<p>The court has consistently held a member state may not plead provisions, practices or circumstances within its internal legal system to justify a failure to comply with Community law.</p>
