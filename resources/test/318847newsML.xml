<headline>CBOT soybeans end mostly lower as rally fizzles.</headline>

<p>CBOT soybean futures closed mostly lower, succumbing to pressure from news rains in Brazil aided dry crops, traders said.</p>
<p>"Throughout the region there were good rains on Saturday with an average of around 40 millimetres," said Odair Bachini, agronomist with Cotricruz cooperative in Cruz Alta.</p>
<p>"This should be enough to replenish soil moisture for the next 10 days," he added.</p>
<p>Soybeans mustered a strong rally at midsession as bulls maintained South American rains were not enough to ensure ample soybean supplies.</p>
<p>"South American weather is getting better but we need confirmation the recent rally has cut off demand and we won't see that until Friday morning," said Mark Cermak of O'Connor and Co, referring to USDA's weekly export sales data.</p>
<p>World demand was expected to be strong, the bulls said, citing talk a private analytical firm had cut its ending stocks projection to 137 million tonnes from 140 million. Both figures were below USDA's estimate for 155 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Soybeans ended two cents per bushel lower to 1/4 cent higher with March down two at $7.46-1/4 a bushel. The March contract peaked at $7.54 and traded as low as $7.38-1/2.</p>
<p>Funds were active buyers on the day, accounting for at least 14 million bushels on the day, traders said. Refco Inc bought six million bushels March, Goldenberg-Hehmeyer bought four million March, they said.</p>
<p>But commercial selling stalled the rally with Cargill Inc said to be a seller of at least two million bushels March.</p>
<p>But options-related selling totalled at least five million March, traders said.</p>
<p>E.D. and F. Man International sold 500 March $7.50 calls at 10-1/2 cents per bushel. Continental Grain sold 300 March $7.50 puts at 15 to 15-1/2 cents per bushel, traders said.  </p>
<p>Soybean volume was estimated at 60,000 contracts, against Friday's total of 46,097 contracts.</p>
