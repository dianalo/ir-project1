<headline>U.S. corporate debt new issue crowd grows.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-11-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>As the U.S. corporate debt market waits eagerly for issuers to pull the trigger on more than $4 billion worth of deals expected this week, even more issuers are crowding into the new issue arena as the calendar year ticks away, dealers said.</p>
<p>One hot issue, Rubbermaid Inc's upcoming A2/A-plus rated $200 million 10-year debt offering was seen twice oversubscribed prior to sale, dealers added.  </p>
<p>"A name like Rubbermaid definitely stands out from the crowd," said one high-grade syndicate source. "It's their first foray into the debt markets, it's very well known, and a single-A credit," he noted.</p>
<p>"We call them museum pieces...they come to market once in a blue moon, their deals get priced fairly, and they get very well put away and you never see them again," he added.</p>
<p>Dealers said on the whole they're expecting one of the busiest weeks for the year as we approach the end of the calendar.  </p>
<p>"It's going to be one of the better weeks this year," another high-grade syndicate source said. "Every day you hear new names as the calendar starts to run out for the year."</p>
<p>"It's definitely a buyers' market," he added. "People are going to sit back and pick and choose."</p>
<p>U.S. corporations enticed by lower financing rates continue to bring debt to market at a rapid fire rate as U.S. Treasury yields remain at their lowest levels since the spring.  </p>
<p>On Monday, TransAmerica Finance issued $200 million in A2/A-plus rated 6.375 percent five-year notes to yield 41 basis points via lead manager, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Dealers said new issues have been met with good demand with some upcoming deals seen issue bid going into the pricing.</p>
<p>"The TransAmerica deal was well received by the market," said one syndicate source.</p>
<p>ABN Amro Bank NV is expected to set $300 million in AA2/AA-minus rated 30-year debt, sources said.  </p>
<p>Royal Bank of Canada is also expected to issue $300 million in 15-year debt. The issue is expected to consist of a fixed maturity for the first 10 years and a floating rate for the remaining five years, via JP Morgan Securities.  </p>
<p>Also, Xerox Corp is expected to set $250 million in 20-year debt with a seven-year put option, sources said.</p>
<p>Smith Barney is expected to underwrite a $200 million 30-year deal for TransContinental Gas Pipeline.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs &amp; Co is expected to underwrite a $750 million two-part debt offering for Millenium America, dealers said.</p>
<p>The first tranche is expected to consist of $500 million in 10-year debt and the second tranche is expected to consist of $250 milllion of a 30-year maturity, dealers added.  </p>
<p>In addition, Peoples Bank Corp may tap the market with a $150 million 10-year debt issue via Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>Also, sources said Simon DeBartolo may tap the market with $200 million in 10-year debt via Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Bank of Boston is expected to tap the market with $200 million in 30-year thousand dollar par trust capital preferred securities via Merrill Lynch &amp; Co to be priced off the U.S. T-bond, syndicate sources said.</p>
<p>A similar deal with an identical structure is said to be in the works for BankAmerica with Goldman Sachs as lead underwriter, they added.  </p>
<p>"There's going to be quite a few of these issues coming to market. They are structured to appeal primarily to institutional investors, which are not usually preferred-type buyers," one high-grade syndicate source said.</p>
<p>"These will in a smaller way compete with the outstanding paper for that bank. ... The only thing is that they usually come cheaper so they look very well when you compare them to outstanding paper," he added.</p>
<p>Still, in the private placement arena, a slew of new issues are slated to come to market as well.</p>
<p>Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co, a unit of Tenneco Inc, is expected to price a $400 million two-part debt offering via JP Morgan Securities.</p>
<p>The first tranche is expected to consist of $200 million in 10-year senior notes and the second tranche consist of $200 million in 10-year senior subordinated notes, sources said.</p>
<p>Atrium Cos is expected to issue $100 million in 144A 10-year senior subordinated notes via BT Securities, sources said.</p>
<p>Off the calendar is Cable Plus Holdings' $150 million in 10-year 144A notes which has been postponed according to underwriter Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Eastern Energy Ltd is also expected to issue $300 million in  10-year 144A debt via Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Also, WCI Steel is expected to tap the market with a $300 million 10-year senior secured note deal via Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities.</p>
<p>Hawk Corp is expected to bring $100 million in 144A notes due 2003 with price talk in the 10.25 to 10.50 percent range, sources said.</p>
