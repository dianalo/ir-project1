<p>Speculation is in full swing in the South East Asian currency markets. Compared with the end of 1996, the Thai baht has fallen by almost 25 percent against the U.S. dollar, the Indonesian rupiah by almost 10 percent and the Malaysian ringgit by five percent.</p>
<p>In all cases the reason for the speculation is a relatively high current account deficit. The high availability of international capital in the last few years has enabled countries to swell imports and current account deficits. But at the same time the capital flows react very sensitively when the deficits reach a critical size.</p>
<p>In Thailand the deficit, which was financed only in a small part by foreign direct investment, nonetheless totalled more than eight percent of gross domestic product in 1996. The crisis in the property and financial sector and the country's structural problems come on top of this.</p>
<p>Under this constellation the international capital market's confidence that the investment funded by foreign capital will result in higher export income in future is fading. The result is that capital imports have turned into capital exports.</p>
<p>The Thai central bank has tried to counter the speculation with foreign exchange controls. However this cannot correct fundamental misalignments. On the contrary, this game of financial protectionism has made it more difficult to finance the current account deficit and is thus counterproductive.</p>
<p>Even massive intervention to support the baht vanished into thin air without effect. Finally the Bank of Thailand had to abandon the link to the dollar which had held well for more then 10 years on July 2, switching over instead to controlled floating.</p>
<p>Experience shows that the foreign exchange market tends toward exaggeration in the period of extreme uncertainty which follows the freeing up of the exchange rate. If economic policy responds quickly and makes a clear and consistent presentation of the problems it faces and the measures planned to counter them, then the markets quickly calm down.</p>
<p>There is an urgent need for a plan to resolve the banking crisis in order to create trust both at home and abroad. If economic policy takes the initiative then the chances are good that the depreciation of the baht in 1997 could be limited to a total of 15 to 20 percent.</p>
<p>The capital outflows which are behind the depreciation and the depreciation itself necessitate a real economic adjustment. Imports, and thus economic growth, must fall to cut the current account deficit. This development was indicated in the first half and is expected to continue at a stronger pace in the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>A recession can now barely be avoided. A glimmer of hope is offered by exports, which have so far been disappointing, but which will benefit increasingly from the devaluation.</p>
<p>But the outbreak of a raging blaze across south-east Asia seems unlikely.</p>
<p>As was demonstrated by Mexico in 1994 and also by the speculation against the Czech crown two months ago, international financial markets distinguish clearly between the economic data and economic policy in individual countries, focusing their attention on countries with similar problems.</p>
<p>Indonesia and the Philippines have taken preventive measures, freeing up the exchange rates of their currencies and agreeing emergency programmes with the International Monetary Fund. These are having a positive impact on the markets, building up confidence.</p>
<p>Malaysia managed to reduce its current account deficit markedly last year. China and Hong Kong are in a very comfortable position with very high currency reserves.</p>
<p>One advantage of almost all economies in the Far East is the high domestic capital formation, which in the past has meant that investment could be financed mainly from domestic sources and has therefore kept foreign debt relatively low in international comparison.</p>
<p>All in all the international financial markets appear unimpressed by this wave of speculation. We still expect high capital flows into emerging markets this year and next. The reason for this lies in real economic developments. Latin America is currently remarkably crisis-resistant. Current account deficits are moderate and economic growth is picking up.</p>
<p>In addition, exports will again pick up more quickly in some Asian countries, such as South Korea and China, after a temporary slowdown in 1996. In eastern Europe economic developments are very mixed. While the currency crisis in the Czech Republic will lead to a marked slowdown in growth, economic expansion is accelerating in Hungary. For Russia, we expect an increase in real gross domestic product in 1998.</p>
