<p>Canadian Agriculture Minister Ralph Goodale said on Wednesday the creation of an international food reserve would be the topic of unofficial conversations at an United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization forum in Rome next week.</p>
<p>"It is not officially on the agenda. But part of what will happen in Rome, apart from the official agenda, is a great deal of corridor conversations, which on occasion can be more valuable than the official proceedings," Goodale told</p>
<p>reporters in a conference call.</p>
<p>He said he was likely to discuss the issue with U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, and added that officials from both countries had already held casual discussions on the issue.</p>
<p>    "I think there is a very serious desire on part of both Canada and the United States and many other countries around the world to try to be as creative and constructive as we can in coming to grips with all of this," Goodale said.</p>
<p>    "I must say that the right kind of solution doesn't obviously leap off the page. But I do sense among a number of my counterparts ... a real desire to try to tackle some of these issues in a very serious way. And we'll see where those conversations lead," he said.</p>
