<p>Asian metal dealers were divided in their opinion on Wednesday over the market impact of a strike at the world's biggest copper mine in northern Chile.</p>
<p>Some dealers said the strike by about 300 of the 2,000 workers at the Escondida mine may prompt a spike in copper prices later on Wednesday on the London Metal Exchange (LME), while others believed there would be no impact at all.</p>
<p>"Psychologically, it makes an impact. Fundamentally, it shouldn't," Vinod Kumar, director of Singapore metal company Donald Mcarthy, told Reuters.  </p>
<p>The workers at Escondida, owned by Broken Hill Proprietary Corp Plc and RTZ Corp Plc, voted to strike on Tuesday after rejecting a company pay offer.</p>
<p>A trader for a European metal house added: "The news will have a psychological impact. It may push copper back up again."</p>
<p>Dealers said three month copper on the LME, which closed on Tuesday at US$2,281 a tonne, may rise to $2,300 on the news.</p>
<p>Some traders said LME operators could use the Escondida news as an opportunity to buy and then unload copper if the contract approaches $2,300.  </p>
<p>"It will be a good chance to pickup stuff and then people will sell it off just as quickly," a trader said.</p>
<p>Other base metal traders, however, believe the impact of the strike will be limited.</p>
<p>"It's only 15 percent of the work force. That number is quite easily replaceable," a dealer for another European trader said.</p>
<p>"What impact?" a dealer in Singapore asked. "There's no impact out here. The number of workers in the mine are too few."</p>
<p>"I called a few guys this morning and they all want to see more news on whether the strike will get worse," a trader said.  </p>
<p>Three month copper was quoted by the trade at 0330 GMT at $2,276/81 a tonne, slightly easier than the London close.</p>
<p>"Despite (yesterday's) bounce off the recent lows, the market needs to close above $2,310 to reverse the negative chart picture in the short-term," broker Brandeis said in its daily review.</p>
<p>Copper premiums in Singapore were also unaffected by the Escondida news and were even quoted easier by the trade at between $20-$30 a tonne compared to yesterday's $20-$40 a tonne. "There's no strength in the market," Kumar said, adding that business around Southeast Asia was "mostly routine."  </p>
<p>One dealer said demand for other base metals in the region was steady "but not spectacular. I think the mood in the market will continue to remain bearish."</p>
<p>Three month aluminium was seen by the trade at 0330 GMT at $1,553/57 a tonne against the close in London on Tuesday of $1,555 a tonne.</p>
