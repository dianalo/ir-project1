<p>First quarter sales results released on Monday by two large Australian retailers reflected continuing difficult trading conditions, analysts said.</p>
<p>Upmarket department store group David Jones Ltd reported first quarter sales of A$310.5 million, down 2.9 percent from a year earlier, while retail giant Coles Myer Ltd said sales for the 13 weeks to October 27 rose 5.6 percent to A$4.45 billion.</p>
<p>The rise at Coles was well above inflation but lower than growth in recent quarters, reflecting the general slowing in retail sales across the industry, the company said.  </p>
<p>David Jones said its results reflected a continuation of the difficult retail environment in the fourth quarter last year.</p>
<p>"The low levels of consumer confidence and, in particular, concerns about job security have had a depressing impact on consumer spending," it said.</p>
<p>David Jones said it hoped for a further cut in official interest rates, which could boost spending in the lead up to Christmas.</p>
<p>Analysts, however, said a rate cut was likely to be only mildly positive.  </p>
<p>"I think employment security is more important than interest rates at the moment," said Macquarie Equities retail analyst Simon Shakesheff. "People are worried about jobs and a half point change in interest rates is not going to change that."</p>
<p>A second analyst said the results showed trading conditions remained fairly tough.</p>
<p>"The food side is still pretty strong ... but the discretionary side is pretty difficult," the analyst said.</p>
<p>Coles Myer managing director Peter Bartels, who described the first quarter results as satisfactory, said the company had adopted a cautious approach to the critical Christmas period.  </p>
<p>"But we are hopeful that customers will respond to the stable economic environment and adopt a more relaxed approach to spending over the next few months," he said in a statement.</p>
<p>Macquarie's Shakesheff said it could take some time for consumers to feel comfortable and increase their spending.</p>
<p>"Christmas at this stage is shaping up as fairly tough," he said.</p>
<p>"I think we are looking at this time next year for things to go better if the general economic scenario is correct," Shakesheff said.</p>
