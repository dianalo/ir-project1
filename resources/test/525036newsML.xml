<p>A Massachusetts basketball coach has claimed in court papers that Nike Inc.'s PLAY marketing campaign unfairly copied a minority youth programme he has run under the same acronym since 1990.</p>
<p>In the federal lawsuit filed in Springfield, Mass., Dennis Jackson alleges Nike based its Participate in the Lives of America's Youth programme, or PLAY, on a non-profit summer institute for minority youth he has operated in Massachusetts since 1990.</p>
<p>The Oregon-based atheletic footwear maker had no comment on the suit Monday.</p>
<p>Jackson is seeking damages in excess of $1 million, according to the court paper.</p>
<p>"I'm just really disappointed in Nike's posture in the way they treated the whole situation," Jackson said.</p>
<p>Between 1991 and 1993, Jackson sought financial backing from Nike for his programme, which he called Planned Learned Achievement for Youth, or PLAY. It is a basketball camp that stresses personal growth and includes academic counselling, the court papers said.</p>
<p>Jackson alleged he relayed proposals to the company through superstar Michael Jordan, who attended a basketball camp run by Jackson in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Nike rejected Jackson's appeals for backing several times and then it created its own programme in 1994, the court papers said.</p>
<p>Jackson complained to Nike after learning it had created its own programme, the suit says, and the company promised to support the Massachusetts programme in 1995.</p>
<p>The suit says Nike offered Jackson both financial support and marketing help, but did not follow through on the agreement.</p>
<p>Jackson is dean of students at a junior high school in Amherst, Mass. He runs his summer programme on the campus of Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass.</p>
<p>Nike's stock rose 87.5 cents to $53 on the New York Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading.</p>
