<p>The blast that killed at least 17 people in a busy San Juan shopping district tore at a close-knit community where people knew each other well, one resident said Friday.</p>
<p>"About 90 percent of the people who died I knew first hand or by their face," said Samuel Bernejo Ubinas, standing in his damaged household goods store across the street from the six-story Humberto Vidal Building, where the blast occured.</p>
<p>One side of his shop, Comercial Ubinas, was a mass of broken dishes, glassware and Christmas gifts. His staff was cleaning up as the salvage operation continued outside.</p>
<p>Ubinas said the explosion occurred just as the shop door opened on Calle de Diego, a commercial street in the working-class Rio Piedras district. "I told the security guard to open the door. A second later day turned to night. All the glass came down and dust came in. A van hit the wall."</p>
<p>Ubinas and his staff rushed out to Calle de Diego to help and he said he saw one woman crushed to death by a car. "By the church, I saw a woman and a baby. The woman was dead but the baby was alive. I picked up the baby and told somebody to take it away in case there was another explosion.</p>
<p>Ubinas said he was a trained paramedic and had performed a kind of triage as people rushed to help. "These are alive, these are dead, don't waste your time on them," he told them.</p>
<p>He said the community was very close. His own shop had been started by his grandfather 75 years ago, the Humberto Vidal Building had been there for 25 years and the California Jewelry Shop, also badly damaged, about 40 years.</p>
<p>He estimated damage to his shop at $300,000 to $400,000. "This is nothing," he said of his shop. Then, pointing across the road, he said, "That over there is too much."</p>
