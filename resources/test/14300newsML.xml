<p>Surinam's ruling New Front coalition was dealt a harsh blow on Monday when one of the four coalition parties staged a walk-out just 10 days before a vote for president.</p>
<p>The Party for National Unity and Solidarity (KTPI), which represents Javanese voters in the former Dutch colony, said it had left the New Front to form a separate political faction. The move followed the New Front's recent decision to ally with the Pendawalima party, which also represents the descendants of 19th century Javanese indentured labourers.</p>
<p>The jockeying comes ahead of a Sept. 5 meeting of Surinam's United Peoples Assembly (VVV) to vote for a new president. The 869-member VVV, which includes regional and municipal councilors, will choose between incumbent President Ronald Venetiaan and Jules Wijdenbosch, candidate for the National Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Officials of the defecting KTPI said they had not ruled out alliances with either the New Front or NDP for the vote. The NDP is closely associated with Surinam's former military strongman Desi Bouterse who ruled in the 1980s with Wijdenbosch as his right-hand-man.</p>
<p>The South American country of 400,000 people has endured two military coups, seven years of dictatorship and widespread guerrilla activity in the last two decades.</p>
