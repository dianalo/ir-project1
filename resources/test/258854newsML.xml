<p>The  Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Monday sued a home health care provider for its "Speak English Only" policy and for allegedly firing Hispanic-American workers who objected to it.</p>
<p>The suit, filed in Manhattan federal court, was brought on behalf of two women who alleged that Brooklyn, New York-based Long Life Home Care Service fired them shortly after a supervisor met with them to discuss "speaking Spanish on the job."</p>
<p>Long Life, which employes some 1,500 workers, does not dispute the existence of its policy prohibiting speaking of a language other than English during working hours, the EEOC said.</p>
<p>However, the two plaintiffs alleged that the policy even prohibited employees from speaking Spanish during breaks, lunch in the cafeteria and within one city block of Long Life's office building.</p>
<p>The company could not be reached for comment.</p>
