<p>(By Peter Griffiths</p>
<p>European bourses were nervous and mostly lower on Friday, with sentiment undermined by another big Tokyo share selloff overnight, and both stock and currency trading marked time ahead of key U.S. jobs data.</p>
<p>The bloodletting in Tokyo, where Japanese shares plummeted again after a week of furious selling, paradoxically softened the dollar against the yen in early European trade. Analysts said the perception was the stock freefall may prompt a repatriation of Japanese funds to cover share losses.</p>
<p>Dollar trading was also cautious ahead of U.S. non-farm payroll figures, a prime clue to future U.S. interest rate policy, due out at 1330.</p>
<p>British and French shares were down in morning trading despite Wall Street rallying overnight to a fresh record closing high of 6,625.67 points -- up 1.16 percent on the day. German shares also started lower in pre-bourse electronic business, though floor trading in Frankfurt moved considerably higher for technical reasons.</p>
<p>Analysts said there were a number of factors at play to account for European share weakness, but confidence was generally undermined by worries about a potential wave of Japanese selling of overseas investments.</p>
<p>In Tokyo the key Nikkei average of 225 leading shares tumbled 770.22 points or 4.26 percent to close at 17,303.65, the lowest close since August 1995. Worries about huge Japanese bank debts and the economy generally have taken Tokyo's cumulative share losses for its first trading week of the new year to a whopping 10.6 percent.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt dealers attributed a fall in values during pre-bourse screen trading to the Tokyo rout but later the DAX index of floor trading, which ends in the afternoon before Wall Street opens, rose in a delayed reaction to Thursday's U.S. rally and was nearly 1.5 percent up by 1145 GMT. Dealers in London said the lower FTSE 100 index was unsettled by talk of higher interest rates on both sides of the Atlantic and by a weak British retail sector after a profits warning from catalogue retailer Argos.</p>
<p>Richard Jeffrey, strategist at Charterhouse Tilney, said he expected at least a 25 basis point British interest rate hike following next Wednesday's regular monetary meeting between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George.</p>
<p>And the general perception was that if December's U.S. employment total later on Friday showed a sharp rise this could prompt an early tightening of U.S. credit.</p>
<p>In Paris French stocks were also weaker in cautious trading ahead of the U.S. figures. Brokers said investors were taking profits on the bourse's 0.75 percent rise on Thursday that brought it within striking distance of its all-time record of 2,360.98 points.</p>
<p>Apart from events in Tokyo, the currency markets were also focusing on the non-farm payrolls, which economists polled by Reuters expected on average to rise by 192,000. The higher the figure the more chance the Fed will seek an early rate hike to cool the economy. Japan's economic problems have caused a recent progressive weakening of the yen despite attempts by Japanese officials earlier this week to talk it higher. Nevertheless analysts said they did not expect dollar/yen to jump one way or the other on Friday.</p>
<p>"There are two counterbalancing arguments (concerning the yen and the Japanese asset market)...you've got the argument that a weak stock market will lead to lower interest rates and a weaker yen. But then it might mean capital repatriation," said BZW currency strategist Chris Turner in London.</p>
<p>"I don't think we're going to see a big move in the dollar/yen maybe until we get more guidance from official comments," he said.</p>
<p>At 1145 GMT the dollar was trading at 115.45 yen, down from late Thursday's European level of 116.20.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1145 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was trading at 115.45 yen and 1.5770 marks compared with 116.20 yen and 1.5775 marks late in Europe on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1145</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was down 11.8 points at 4,075.2.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was down 8.15 at 2,340.93.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was up 39.8 at 2,932.43 but the IBIS DAX of electronic trading was down 4.34 points at 2,932.35.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $358.55 compared with its London close of $355.75 on Thursday. Silver was up four cents at $4.75.</p>
