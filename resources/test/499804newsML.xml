<p>President Clinton Thursday said the federal government would hire at least 10,000 people off welfare over the next four years in an effort to cope with the effects of the law he signed last year curbing the programme.</p>
<p>Clinton convened a special Cabinet meeting to showcase the effort and set an example for the private sector, which will bear the brunt of what he himself estimates will be a need to move 2 million people from welfare to work by 2000.</p>
<p>Appearing with two former welfare recipients who now work for the Social Security Administration, Clinton said that the federal government must do its share to hire such people, and said that six of the 10,000 would work within the White House.</p>
<p>"I'm pleased to announce that we will hire at least 10,000 welfare recipients over the next four years, and we will urge private contractors that work with government to hire people off welfare as well," he said at the start of the Cabinet meeting.</p>
<p>"These will not be make-work jobs. These will be jobs that actually need to be filled, work that needs to be done," he added. "We will demand the highest performance ... But we will also offer them a chance at a new beginning."</p>
<p>The bulk of the federal jobs will come from the Commerce Department, which has committed to hiring 4,180, followed by the Defence Department and the Veterans Administration, which have promised to sign up 1,605 and 800 respectively.</p>
<p>White House officials said the jobs, some of which would be part-time or temporary, would typically be entry-level, low-skilled positions, including clerical, janitorial and outdoor forestry tasks.</p>
<p>Many of the jobs within Commerce Department, for example, will be census-takers who walk door to door doing surveys.</p>
<p>Since Clinton signed the welfare law last August, an act that helped position him as a centrist during his successful re-election campaign, he has repeatedly exhorted businesses and non-profit groups to hire more people off welfare.</p>
<p>Last month he ordered the Cabinet to draw up plans for the federal hiring in response to the controversial law, which ended the federal entitlement to welfare, limited benefits to five years and required people to work after two.</p>
<p>"Of course, the vast majority of these jobs will have to come from the private sector, and I will convene a meeting of business leaders here at the White House next month to talk about what more can be done," Clinton said Thursday. "But the government must do its share as well."</p>
<p>The federal government employs about 1.9 million employees nationwide, representing about 1.5 percent of the nation's work force according to figures released by the White House.</p>
<p>The 10,000 jobs that the government says it will provide over the four years represent about 0.5 percent of the two million jobs that Clinton believes need to be created.</p>
<p>The White House said that over the past four years the welfare rolls have fallen by 2.76 million to 11.36 million recipients as of January 1997, largely because of the strong economy as well as state-run welfare-to-work policies.</p>
<p>The federal government has itself been shrinking over that period, but the White House said it hired more than 190,000 permanent and temporary employees last year as a result of regular attrition and hiring in its work force.</p>
<p>"We're talking welfare dependent mothers who in most cases have small children," White House Spokesman Mike McCurry said. "We make no apologies for making federal employment opportunities available for exactly those kinds of people. They are in many cases the poorest of the poor."</p>
