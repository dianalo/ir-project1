<p>OGE Energy Inc's second quarter results are being hurt by unseasonably cool weather, Treasurer Jim Hatfield said Wednesday.</p>
<p>He gave no specifics but told analysts that Oklahoma, which is served by the company's regulated utility, OG&amp;E Electric Services, has had a "very cool June."</p>
<p>In the first quarter, unseasonably warmer weather left the company with a loss of $260,000, compared with a year-earlier profit of $538,000. After preferred dividend payments, the first quarter loss was $0.02 a share.  </p>
<p>In last year's second quarter, when temperatures were normal, the company earned $0.86 a share.</p>
<p>For the full year 1997, Hatfield said, the company projects that start-up costs for its Origen Inc non-regulated energy services business will reduce earnings by $0.05 to $0.10 a share.</p>
<p>Later, in answer to questions, he said Origen had lost $0.01 a share through April, "so we're hoping we can beat" the projected loss for the full year.</p>
<p>He said Origen is expected to break even next year.  </p>
<p>Senior Vice President-Finance Al Strecker said the company's Enogex Inc subsidiary is "the growth vehicle for OGE Energy at this time," and Chief Executive Officer Steven Moore said Enogex would be the primary engine of growth for the next few years.</p>
<p>Hatfield said Enogex, a non-regulated natural gas production and transmission subsidiary, provided 13 percent of OGE's earnings last year. "We hope to get that up to around 20 percent," he said.  </p>
<p>Noting that the company's dividend has held steady at $2.66 per year for several years, he said OGE will focus on growth as a way to reach its goal of a 75 percent payout ratio.</p>
<p>The ratio was 82 percent last year, down from 110 percent in 1992, he said.</p>
<p>Hatfield said OGE, as part of its growth strategy, is looking at both buying generation capacity and operating plants owned by others.</p>
<p>Answering analysts' questions, Moore said, "We have not been participating in the Northeast," where generating capacity has been put on the market.</p>
<p>Hatfield said the company plans to develop energy marketing skills.</p>
<p>"These will be defensive in nature," he said, designed to give the company a profitable regional strategy to serve such niches as Oklahoma's co-ops and municipal electric operations.</p>
