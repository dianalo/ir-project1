<p>Burma has resumed the extension of the Rangoon International Airport that was suspended in 1988 after Japan stopped providing financial aid for the project, a government official said on Saturday.</p>
<p>"The airport extension project, originally to be carried out with the Japanese government's OECF loan, was resumed recently without any foreign assistance," Transport Minister Lieutenant General Thein Win said.</p>
<p>"The ministries of transport and communication commenced the airport extension project without any foreign assistance according to the original Japanese design," he told a ceremony to officially begin work on the runway extension project.</p>
<p>The project will cost 200 million kyat and is targeted to be finished within 18 months, said Director General Tin Aye of Civil Aviation.</p>
<p>On the black market, about 160 kyats buy one dollar while the official exchange rate is about six to the dollar.</p>
<p>The existing airport runway will be extended by 3,000 feet (1,000 metres) to enable 747 jumbo jets to land, Tin Aye said.</p>
<p>Japan reached agreement with the former socialist government of Burma in 1987 on a loan to extend the runway. The project began in February 1987 but was suspended after Tokyo stopped aid to Burma when the military seized power in 1988 and quashed pro-democracy street demonstrations.</p>
