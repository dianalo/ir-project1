<p>Louisiana's Supreme Court has struck down a four-year-old tax on corporate dividends, a move that will force the state to refund $85 million it collected from major corporations, the Advocate newspaper reported.</p>
<p>In its ruling last week, the state Suprme Court upheld a ruling by District Judge Bob Hester of Baton Rouge, who said the 1993 law was unconstitutional because it amounted to eitehr a new tax or an increase to an existing tax.</p>
<p>Louisiana's constitution bars the legislature from raising or increasing taxes in odd-numbered years.</p>
<p>John Kennedy, who as secretary of the state Department of Revenue and Taxation was one of the defendants in the case, said revenues collected under the tax were held in an escrow account pending resolution of the lawsuit. Therefore, he said, the ruling would not affect the state budget.</p>
<p>He said corporations that paid the taxes under protest will have the payments refunded to them, with interest. The tax had raised about $85 million since it took effect.</p>
<p>The lawsuit challenging the tax was filed by Dow Hydrocarbons &amp; Resources Inc, a unit of Dow Chemical Co.</p>
