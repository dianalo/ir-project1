<p>Motorola Inc said Thursday the first satellite-to-ground messages were sent using an Iridium satellite.</p>
<p>On July 3, an Iridium satellite transmitted hundreds of messages to Iridium prototype pagers as it passed over Motorola's Satellite Communications Group (SCG) Chandler facility.  The first links between the satellite and Iridium prototype phones were made July 7, Motorola said.</p>
<p>Iridium is a communications system designed to provide subscribers worldwide voice, data, fax and paging capabilities using phones and pagers linked to a network of 66 low-earth orbit satellites. Seventeen of the satellites have been launched.</p>
<p>"These first communications links with Iridium satellites represent major technical milestones toward commercial activation of the system in late 1998," said Mark Borota, vice president and general manager for SCG's Mobile Satellite Systems Division. SCG is the developer of the Iridium system.</p>
<p>The pagers are being designed by Motorola's Messaging Systems Products Group.</p>
<p>The phones are being developed by Motorola's Cellular Subscriber Sector.</p>
<p>Iridium LLC is an international consortium of numerous companies and organizations, including Motorola, Iridium World Communications Ltd, Lockheed Martin Corp and Sprint Corp.</p>
