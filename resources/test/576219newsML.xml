<p>Crude oil prices surged by almost $1.00 a barrel in New York on Monday as a series of potentially bullish international developments triggered a wave of speculative buying.</p>
<p>Two big oil exporters, Iran and Colombia, suffered earthquakes over the weekend, while fishermen blockaded a key North Sea oil terminal in the Shetland Islands in a dispute over payments they claim are due for an oil spill.</p>
<p>There were also threats by the new British government to slap sanctions on another key exporter, Nigeria, and a pledge by a top U.S. military commander to defend the strategic Strait of Hormuz against any Iranian threat.</p>
<p>However, none of the weekend developments pointed to any immediate disruption of crude flows, and analysts noted that the market still looked to be oversupplied through the summer.</p>
<p>"Last week OPEC was talking about what to do about overproduction, and nothing has changed that. This is a purely speculative move," said Nizam Sharif, an analyst at Hornsby &amp; Co. in Houston.</p>
<p>On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures for June delivery settled up 95 cents a barrel at $21.38.</p>
<p>June heating oil ended 2.13 cents higher at 56.65 cents a gallon while June gasoline was up 1.58 cents at 64.47 cents a gallon.</p>
<p>Coffee prices on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange rose sharply, with bullish sentiment linked to low stocks re-ignited by a report from brokerage Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>"There seems to be nothing to stand in the way of record high prices being attained until the new crop mild coffee becomes available next season," Merrill Lynch analyst Judith Ganes wrote in a bi-weekly report.</p>
<p>"Both producer and consumer stocks are at low levels and current price levels are not sufficient to curb demand."</p>
<p>The highest price paid for coffee on the CSCE was 340.70 cents a lb set on April 14, 1977.</p>
<p>"The report from Merrill Lynch showed the seriousness of the situation and emphasized the potential of this market," said Victor Henriquez, president of Hencrop Becstone in Miami.</p>
<p>Traders and analysts said the market would probably continue to be well underpinned ahead of the June through August winter season in top grower Brazil.</p>
<p>Two severe frosts in 1994, one in late June and another in early July, cut Brazil's 1995/96 crop by some 50 percent and sent futures prices to near 10-year highs.</p>
<p>"The first time someone yells 'cold weather' this thing is going to explode," Henriquez said.</p>
<p>Coffee for July delivery closed up 11.75 cents a lb at 229.65 cents.</p>
<p>Soybean futures on the Chicago Board of Trade closed sharply lower with selling partly triggered by monthly supply/demand data issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>USDA left its forecast for soybean stocks as of August 31, the end of the current season, unchanged at 125 million bushels. Most analysts had been looking for a cut of 5 to 10 million bushels.</p>
<p>"There was a lot of speculative liquidation in beans. There was general disappointment over the failure of USDA to lower the stocks carryout," said Joel Karlin, senior grains analyst for Everen Securities.</p>
<p>Rapid progress planting this year's soybean crop in the U.S. Midwest also weighed on the market. USDA announced after the close of trading that 20 percent of the crop had been planted as of Sunday, well above the five-year average of 12 percent.</p>
<p>"We are still planting this crop in record early time...and that always has bearish aspects," said Dale Gustafson, analyst with Smith Barney.</p>
<p>"In fact, getting it planted early many times gives way to better than trend yields," he said.</p>
<p>Soybeans for July delivery closed down 20-1/2 cents a bushel at $8.68-1/2.</p>
