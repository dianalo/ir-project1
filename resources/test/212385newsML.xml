<p>South Korea complained on Saturday about its $14 billion trade deficit with Japan, saying Tokyo should increase investment in South Korea as a way to boost Seoul's exports to Japan, Japanese officials said.</p>
<p>The complaint came in a meeting between South Korean Trade Minister Park Jae-yoon and Japanese Trade Minister Shinji Sato during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) conference here, said a senior Japanese trade official who took part in the talks. The official was speaking to reporters.</p>
<p>"We are concerned about our trade deficit," the Japanese official quoted Park as telling Sato. "We should tackle this problem by increasing Korean exports to Japan, not by the traditional way of slowing Japanese exports to Korea."</p>
<p>Park said he was especially concerned that Japan's exports to South Korea might rise steeply in the near future because of Seoul's plans to lift bans on some Japanese products, such as cars, industrial machinery and electronic goods.</p>
<p>Seoul cut the number of restricted import items from Japan from 250 in 1993 to 152 this year as part of its effort to liberalise trade under the terms of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).</p>
<p>South Korea, which became an OECD member this year, plans to scrap all such restrictions by 1999.</p>
<p>South Korea's trade deficit with Japan rose from $10.9 billion in 1994 to $14 billion last year, according to Japanese trade data. It was $11.2 billion in the first 10 months of this year.</p>
<p>Park urged Japan to boost efforts to increase investment in South Korea as a way of increasing Korean exports to Japan. Sato agreed on investment, but said he was not too worried about the trade data, officials said.</p>
<p>"It is important to send delegations of private firms which are serious about investing in South Korea," Sato was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Sato asked Park to speed up the lifting of restrictions on Japanese goods.</p>
<p>In another meeting on the APEC sidelines on Saturday, South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Jong-ha told Japan's Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda that Seoul hoped North Korea would keep to the terms of a framework nuclear agreement with the United States.</p>
<p>He also said South Korea had not dropped the proposal it made jointly with the United States in April for four-way peace talks grouping the two Koreas, the United States and China.</p>
<p>The peace moves have been jolted by a row over a North Korean submarine incursion in September.</p>
<p>South Korea has demanded an apology from North Korea over the incursion, but Pyongyang has refused and threatened to pull out of the landmark 1994 nuclear deal. Under the agreement, Pyongyang agreed to freeze its nuclear programme in return for two nuclear reactors and alternative energy supplies.</p>
