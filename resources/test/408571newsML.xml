<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi said on Thursday that the Italian government would issue its three-year economic targets (DPEF) for 1998-2000 by May 15.</p>
<p>Prodi told the Senate (upper house) that the DPEF would be "extremely detailed" and would be presented by that date with or without an agreement with the opposition on the possibility of bringing forward the 1998 budget.  </p>
<p>"With or without an agreement between the government and the opposition (on bringing forward the 1998 budget), the government intends to send a clear message to our European partners and to the markets," he said.</p>
<p>"By May 15, we will present a DPEF that will be extremely detailed and will send the European Union a plan of convergence which will include the main points of the 1998 budget," he said.</p>
<p>Prodi said he hoped the DPEF could be approved by the end of June. -- Rome newsroom +396-6782501</p>
