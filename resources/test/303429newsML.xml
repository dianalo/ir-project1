<p>Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi Mediaset Group said on Monday it would not bid for the rights to broadcast the Italian national soccer team's home matches in 1997 because it could not justify the cost.</p>
<p>"Mediaset would have to invest 40 billion lire ($26 million) and it is impossible to cover this sum with advertising in the four matches the Italian team will play in Italy this year," Mediaset said in a statement.</p>
<p>State broadcaster RAI's rights to the Italian team's home matches expired last December and Mediaset had to decide by Monday whether to bid for the one year contract.</p>
