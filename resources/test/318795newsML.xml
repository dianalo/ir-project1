<p>California will extend its robust economic expansion into 1997, powered by growth in high-tech Silicon Valley and gains in the entertainment industry.</p>
<p>The Golden State was hard hit by the last recession, saddled with cutbacks in defence spending and shamed by the Orange County financial scandal and bankruptcy. But California has since made a full recovery, state economists say.</p>
<p>In 1996, the state gained over 330,000 jobs and $55 billion of personal income with jobs being created across a wide range of industries, including many high-wage, high-skill and high-technology sectors, the state said in a recent report.</p>
<p>With Silicon Valley companies such as Intel Corp., Sun Microsystems Inc., and Internet darling Netscape Communications Corp. leading the charge, California has solidified its lead in the technology industry.</p>
<p>Hollywood remained one of the nation's biggest exporters last year with blockbuster films such as "Independence Day," "Twister" and "Mission: Impossible," grossing hundreds of millions of dollars overseas. At home, Hollywood had its best year ever last year, with domestic box office receipts rising 8 percent to a record $5.86 billion.</p>
<p>"From bio-technology to multi-media, California is pioneering the creation of new technologies," Gov. Pete Wilson, a Republican, said during a recent visit to Hong Kong. "California intends to compete across America and around the world to win the contest for business expansion, for new investors, and new job creators."</p>
<p>Solid gains in employment and income in California were forecast for the next two years with growth above the national average. In 1997, the state is expected to become the first in the nation with an economic output of more than $1 trillion.</p>
<p>H.D. Palmer, assistant director of the state's department of finance, said California's economic diversity "means that when we go through future business cycles we will be better positioned to weather those storms."</p>
<p>The economic outlook was bright for other western states as well, economists said.</p>
<p>After cutting thousands of workers from its payroll over the past few years, Seattle-based Boeing Co., the world's largest aircraft manufacturer, has reversed course and is hiring again as it completes a merger with McDonnell Douglas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Redmond, Wash.-based software giant Microsoft Corp. continues to dominate the computer industry with its popular Windows operating system, Internet browser and other word processing and office software products.</p>
<p>The outlook for Washington is "extremely positive," said Dennis Fusco, chief economist with the state's employment security department. "We're facing one of the strongest employment growth periods that we've had since the late 80s."</p>
<p>The state's budget has gone from a record $1.7 billion shortfall to a stable reserve. "Today, our state is in excellent shape," former Washington Gov. Mike Lowry said in his State of the State address.</p>
<p>Despite the economic gains, elected officials across the West said their states were at a crossroads.</p>
<p>Federal welfare reform and other cost-cutting measures approved by Congress could sharply reduce state funding, making it more difficult for local governments from San Diego, Calif., to Seattle to fund services, officials warned.</p>
<p>"The good news is that the underlying economy is improving," Standard &amp; Poor's Corp Managing Director Steven Zimmermann said. "But that doesn't mean all the tough decisions are behind state officials."</p>
