<p>Malaysia unveiled on Thursday a new industrial plan which focuses on achieving greater technological self-reliance and enhancing productivity over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>"We also believe that it will help reduce the economic imbalance between the various races who are citizens of this country," Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said when launching The Second Industrial Master Plan.</p>
<p>He described the plan as crucial for Malaysia's economic and political future, saying his government believed that only industrialisation could increase the country's wealth and sophistication. Despite Malaysia's dizzying economic growth in the last decade, Mahathir said he was concerned that indigenous Malays or "Bumiputra" did not make up a large middle-class to reflect their majority share of the population.</p>
<p>"There is as you may have suspected, a political dimension to this Industrial Master Plan as there has always been with all Malaysian Plans," he said.</p>
<p>"We are not industrialising because we want to change the landscape from rice-fields, rubber and palm oil estates to the one that will mirror the developed nation that we aspire to be," he added.</p>
<p>Malaysia's first industrial plan, effective between 1986-1995, focused on large investments and rapid industrialisation. It attracted substantial foreign capital and technology which helped maintain economic growth of over eight percent for the past nine years.</p>
<p>Malaysia's International Trade and Industry Ministry, which drafted the new plan, said it will focus on developing eight key areas of industry up to the year 2005.</p>
<p>The sectors were electrical and electronics, textiles and apparel, chemicals, resource-based industries, agro-based and food products industries, transport, materials, and machinery.</p>
<p>"We have decided to go into engineering, in particular automotive engineering...telecommunications and the IT (information technology) industries," said Mahathir, elaborating on the plan.</p>
<p>"We will also focus on small and medium-scale industries intended not only to supply the need for components by the major industries but also to produce high-quality components and even finished products for the export market," he said.</p>
<p>Under the new plan, the manufacturing sector is projected to grow 10.7 percent a year until 2000 and slow to an average of 8.3 percent a year until 2005, said the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.</p>
<p>"This relatively lower growth of the manufacturing sector is in line with the optimum growth pattern experienced in most developed economies," the ministry said.</p>
<p>Economists said the plan was focused on finding ways to reduce import dependence.</p>
<p>They said the development of local support industries was a logical step for Malaysia, which has transformed itself from an agricultural to an export-driven industrial economy in just over a decade. It aims to become a fully industrialised nation by 2020.</p>
