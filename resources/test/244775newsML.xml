<p>An earthquake measuring 6.5 on the Richter scale jolted Indonesia's capital Jakarta on Monday but there were no reports of damage or casualties, a Meteorological and Geophysics Department official said.</p>
<p>The official said the earthquake struck at 10.54 a.m. (0354 GMT) and its epicentre was in the Indian Ocean 325 km (203 miles) southwest of Jakarta.</p>
<p>Office workers in Jakarta's business district said they felt two jolts, but added that there was no damage.</p>
<p>"It was a funny kind of feeling. Things were shaking and moving in my office on the 24th floor," one said.</p>
<p>A man in Sukabumi, West Java, 75 km (47 miles) south of Jakarta, said his office was shaken twice but nobody was hurt.</p>
<p>Residents in Pelabuhan Ratu, a holiday resort district 100 km (62 miles) southwest of Jakarta said they felt the earthquake but no tidal waves were reported.</p>
<p>"We were surprised by the tremors but nobody actually fled the hotel," an employee of the Samudra Beach Hotel in Pelabuhan Ratu said. "We haven't had any report of damages in our hotel."</p>
<p>More than 100 people were killed on Biak, off northern Irian Jaya, on February 17 when an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale caused tidal waves which hit several villages.</p>
