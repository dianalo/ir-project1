<p>German industry leaders expect European economic and monetary union (EMU) to begin on time in 1999, according to a survey of business executives by the daily Handelsblatt newspaper released on Monday.</p>
<p>A summary of the survey, made available ahead of publication on Tuesday, showed executives believe conditions were set this year for a stable European currency and that enough European Union members will meet the fiscal criteria to enable the beginning of monetary union in 1999.</p>
<p>Siemens AG chairman Heinrich von Pierer said he hoped that as many EU member states as possible would qualify for EMU, because only then would the full benefit of monetary union be felt.</p>
<p>Juergen Schrempp, the chairman of Daimler-Benz AG, warned that should EMU fail to take place in 1999, EU countries with strong currencies like Germany could expect their currency to appreciate in value, putting a dent in exports.</p>
<p>Commerzbank AG chairman Martin Kohlhaussen said the EMU framework set out at the European Union summit in Dublin this month instilled confidence and that the first EMU participants would probably be Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Austria, Ireland and Finland.</p>
<p>German savings banks and credit cooperatives also said they expected EMU to begin in 1999, but warned that the strict criteria restricting budget deficits and public debt must be observed in order for EMU to succeed.</p>
