<p>Germany's independent cable television operators, shackled for over a decade to Deutsche Telekom AG's network monopoly, said on Thursday they were contemplating breaking the chain in light of deregulation.</p>
<p>Until now, only Deutsche Telekom was allowed to build public communications networks, leaving independent cable TV operators the option of connecting individual homes to the cable network in their street.</p>
<p>But that weakness could turn out to be a major strength as independent operators control two thirds of the 16 million subscribers that receive programming over Telekom's cable TV network.</p>
<p>"Should the independent cable operators seek an alternative carrier, Deutsche Telekom would not be able to refinance investments in its own cable network," said Bruno Baumann, president of the Federation of Independent Cable Network Operators (ANGA).</p>
<p>Baumann presented the challenge with a 90-page study containing proposals for modernising Telekom's broadband cable TV network to transform it into a digital superhighway bringing high-speed Internet access to millions of homes.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by ANGA and the ZVEI Electronics Industry Association, calls for a joint effort between independent operators, equipment makers and Deutsche Telekom to upgrade the cable TV network.</p>
<p>"ANGA members alone plan to spend at least five billion marks by the year 2000 to expand their networks," said Baumann.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom's cable TV network currently is used largely for one-way broadcast of television programming and has capacity for around 30 channels. Digital compression technology will allow Telekom to broadcast up to 150 channels over the network to 50 percent of subscribers late next year. Further investment would boost that figure to 95 percent later.</p>
<p>But Baumann said that its proposals go much further than what Telekom has planned so far and could result in as many as 400 channels over the cable TV network that currently has the potential to hook up to over 20 million homes.</p>
<p>The cable is also much faster for Internet surfers than even Telekom's high-speed Integrated Services Digital Network.</p>
<p>Using cable modems, it is possible to transmit a 10 megabyte file in just 13 seconds over the cable network as opposed to 93 minutes with a 14,400 baud modem over an ordinary phone line, Baumann said.</p>
<p>One of the central conflicts between Telekom and the independent cable operators is how to allow cable users to interact with programme providers.</p>
<p>What is needed is a so-called return channel that would allow users to send commands back to programme providers to order goods, send electronic mail, choose a programme or call up a page on the Internet.</p>
<p>Telekom wants to use its ISDN network as the return channel. It has invested huge sums in building the ISDN network into the largest in the world, subsidising its expansion with 200 million marks in rebates to new customers this year. But that is not in the interests of the independent operators.</p>
<p>"We want the return channel in the cable network, otherwise there's nothing in it for us," said Baumann.</p>
<p>The independent cable operators are seeking discussions with Telekom. If these do produce the desired results, then they will seek talks with Telekom's new competitors like Vebacom or Mannesmann.</p>
<p>Should they hook up with the newcomers, a mighty alliance could be formed granting the new phone companies direct access to millions of homes. For this reason, it is likely that Telekom will find a way to cooperate with the cable operators.</p>
