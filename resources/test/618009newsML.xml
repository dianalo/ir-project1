<p>German building group Bilfinger + Berger Bau AG on Tuesday reported an 11.4 percent rise in output in the first four months of 1997 and predicted full-year earnings would match 1996 provided its foreign business could compensate for the weak domestic building sector.</p>
<p>"Presuming we can compensate for falling earnings at home by positive growth in our foreign business, for 1997 we expect to see construction output at around the same levels seen last year and, once again, satisfactory earnings," the group said in its annual report.</p>
<p>Construction output rose to 2.83 billion marks in the four months to end-April with 14.3 percent growth in foreign output to 1.39 billion marks exceeding an 8.6 percent gain in domestic output to 1.39 billion, Bilfinger said.</p>
<p>But the company predicted building output in the full year would fall 1.2 percent to 9.13 billion marks.</p>
<p>"This is not just a result of the economic and structural problems in the German construction industry, but also because of our particularly selective stance in tendering for contracts," management board chairman Christian Roth told the company's annual news conference.</p>
<p>Bilfinger's shares fell after the news and were quoted down 0.30 marks at 66.60 marks at 0950 GMT, contrasting with a slight gain in the overall market.</p>
<p>Group new orders fell 5.1 percent to 2.8 billion marks in the first four months, with domestic new orders up six percent to 1.1 billion marks and foreign new orders down 11.1 percent to 1.72 billion marks.</p>
<p>Group orders in hand rose 2.6 percent to 9.98 billion marks.</p>
<p>Bilfinger said it planned to concentrate full-year 1997 construction output growth on its foreign business. Orders in the first four months were boosted by two large contracts in Thailand and Nigeria in April.</p>
<p>Bilfinger also announced its Australian unit Baulderstone Hornibrook Engineering had won an order worth 100 million marks to build a bridge over the Mekong river in Vietnam. Construction will take 42 months.</p>
