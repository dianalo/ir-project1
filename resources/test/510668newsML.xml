<p>Reading &amp; Bates Corp said Tuesday that first quarter net income was hurt by the Jack Bates casualty, downtime related to the J.W. McLean and drilling at the East Boomvang prospect in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>"...the M.G. Hulme Jr spent approximately 80 days drilling on the East Breaks 688 East Boomvang prospect," said Chief Executive Paul Lloyd. "(The drilling) reduced reported current income by approximately $5.8 million as compared to the rig working at market rates for a third party client."  </p>
<p>First quarter 1997 earnings were also reduced by approximately $2.5 million related to the Jack Bates casualty and 36 days downtime related to the J. W. McLean upgrade.  This equates to an approximate $3.6 million reduction in current reported operating revenue, according to Lloyd.</p>
<p>Operating income for the quarter was $31.2 million on revenues of $83.4 million, compared to operating income for the quarter ended March 31, 1996 of $18.2 million on revenues $61.2 million.</p>
<p>The company said the $13.0 million improvement to operating income is largely attributable to increased revenues as a result of improved dayrates as well as the addition of two vessels to the fleet.  Average utilization for the three months ended March 31, 1997 was 94 percent compared to 95 percent for the three months ended March 31, 1996.</p>
