<p>U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday said he had made no final decision on the involvement of U.S. military forces in relief efforts for Rwandan refugees.</p>
<p>"We have not made a final decision," Clinton told reporters during a joint news conference with Australian Prime Minister John Howard. "I expect to receive a recommendation shortly."</p>
<p>In Washington, Defence Secretary William Perry indicated that the United States had put off plans to send combat troops to Zaire and was preparing instead for a military air relief operation into Rwanda to help a half-million refugees.</p>
<p>Perry said the return of some 500,000 people from Zaire to Rwanda had changed the situation and that fewer than 1,000 U.S. "logistical" personnel were now needed for a military operation led by Canada in Rwanda.</p>
<p>Under the new plan about 200 U.S. Air Force personnel would be sent to Kigali airport in Rwanda, 500 to Entebbe in Uganda and about 100 to Mombasa in Kenya to prepare for the air relief operation, the Pentagon said.</p>
<p>"There's no question that the situation looks better than it did a couple of days ago," Clinton said. "It's also no question that the possibility of serious human loss is still there...We'll try to resolve what we ought to do."</p>
<p>Clinton arrived in Australia on Tuesday for a five-day visit, ahead of next week's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders summit in the Philippines.</p>
