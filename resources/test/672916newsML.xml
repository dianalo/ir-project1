<p>Exxon Corp. said on Thursday it would appeal a $5.058 billion January judgment against the company for the 1989 Valdez oil spill.</p>
<p>Exxon said it would base its appeal on juror misconduct, jury instructions, compensatory damage errors and what it referred to as the "excessiveness" of punitive damages in the case.</p>
<p>The Valdez spill, the largest oil spill in U.S. waters, dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil into the Prince William Sound in March 1989.</p>
<p>Irving, Texas-based Exxon said it had submitted an appellate brief of its case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco, listing 11 legal issues. The filing follows the company's February filing of a notice that it would appeal the judgment.</p>
<p>"Exxon has consistently maintained that the punitive damages in this case are unwarranted and excessive," said Exxon Chairman Lee Raymond. "We believe that this judgment should be set aside or substantially reduced by the appellate courts."</p>
<p>Exxon added that the spill cost the company $3.5 billion, which it said was "more than enough to accomplish the public purposes of punishing Exxon and deterring others from a similar accident."</p>
<p>In its brief, Exxon said "the $5 billion punitive damage verdict was 200 times more than the largest punitive damage award ever upheld by a federal appellate court."</p>
