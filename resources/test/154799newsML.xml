<p>Volatile construction shares, banks and small-caps gave up some of their recent gains as Greek shares spent the session in negative territory before closing above session lows in moderate turnover.</p>
<p>"Players are tuned in but the market is directionless right now, anticipating possible tax measures and the 1997 budget. This doesn't mean it isn't a time for selective buying. I see stocks staging a gradual climb in the short term," said portfolio manager Marilena Vasiloglou at ABN AMRO Mutual funds.</p>
<p>"We are about 80 percent invested but retain adequate liquidity to pounce on opportunities. We like banks and food stocks, they are more defensive," she said.</p>
<p>Financial press reports that the government is planning to tax interest earned on T-bills, derivatives such as swaps, options and FRAs and revamp the tax status of mutual funds, finds the market cautious as players await the 1997 budget.</p>
<p>The finance ministry announced a 40 basis point cut in the marker 12-month T-bill. It will come down to 12.30 percent in the end-October issue.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, block trades in National Mortgage Bank, NIBID, National Housing Bank and Sarantis boosted trading volume to 50.21 billion drachmas. They were attributable to National Bank.</p>
<p>"National Bank was trying to create sufficient capital gains to offset 63 billion drachmas of losses from a single write off of bad loans, scheduled for the second half of 1996," said ING Barings.</p>
<p>"This should do away with most of National's portfolio of bad, politically motivated loans. The write-off is a brave move aimed at cleaning up its balance sheet which is difficult to see through," it said.</p>
