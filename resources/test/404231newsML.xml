<p>THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL REVIEW </p>
<p>Figures released yesterday by the Department of Industrial Relations reveal the pace of wage rises won through enterprise bargaining slowed sharply last quarter, with a decline of one percentage point in average pay rises for private sector workers. Indutrial Relations Minister Peter Reith yesterday warned that despite the apparent slowdown, the underlying trend in small and medium-sized firms was "largely unchanged". Page 1.</p>
<p>-- Labor Senator Robert Ray has placed Senate Deputy President Mal Colston under the spotlight again by asking a Senate estimates committee to investigate whether Colston had put in a travel allowance in Canberra while simultaneously issuing a press release indicating he was in the Gold Coast. Page 2.</p>
<p>-- The Federal Coalition is locked in negotiations with the Opposition over a number of regulatory amendments to its plan to deregulate the telecommunications sector from July 1.  The Government may need to sacrifice some of its key policy commitments in order to secure Senate support for its 600-page reform package. Page 4.</p>
<p>-- Australian Industrial Relations Commission president Justice Deirdre O'Connor confirmed at an industrial law conference in Sydney last weekend that the Commission is convening Full Bench test cases on three crucial areas of the Howard Government's new indstrial relations laws.  Page 5.</p>

<p>-- Social Security Minister Jocelyn Newman has instructed her department to develop proposals for changes which will see wealthy people unable to claim social welfare by extending the discredited Austudy real assets means test to all social benefits.  A Depatment spokesperson said ways of tightening eligibility criteria where the taxable income of people claiming benefits did not reflect their wealth were being examined. Page 1.</p>
<p>-- Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer yesterday called for clarification of Papua New Guinea's plans to renew military action against rebels in Bougainville, and how these plans would be funded. The demand follows Papua New Guinean Prime Mnister Sir Julius Chan's ignorance of Australia's pleas to keep mercenaries out of Bougainville. Page 1.</p>
<p>-- The Federal Government has been left with a further A$1.2 billion embarrassment and an overall deficit of A$8.2 billion after Federal Treasury yesterday admitted to a "major error" in its mid-year financial estimates.  On top of this, Treasury officials yesterday had to explain to a Senate committee the origin of 170 errors in figures published in late January as part of the Government's mid-year review.

<p>-- The Tasmanian Government failed yesterday in its attempt to halt a constitutional challenge to the State's criminal code brought by gay activist Rodney Croome.  Croome said this was one of the biggest obstacles to the attempt to have Tasmania's "anti-gay"law ruled invalid on the grounds it its inconsistent with Federal law guaranteeing sexual privacy.

<p>-- THE SYDNEY MORNING HERALD</p>
<p>-- New South Wales Environment Minister Pam Allan yesterday accused the Wallis Lake council, Great Lakes Council at Forster, of putting 20,000 holidaymakers at risk from tainted oysters over the Christmas holiday period by ignoring orders in November to close sanitary depots suspected of polluting the water. Page 1.</p>
<p>-- The New South Wales Government has told its departments and agencies they will need to seek out cuts in spending of about A$420 million as a result of Federal Government funding cuts, and no State department is exempt from the two per cent cut.  Treasury will have released its Budget review by Friday and the document will reveal a black hole around A$160 million. Page 1</p>
<p>-- Federal Treasury corrections that were not released to the media have embarrassed the Howard Government, with 170 errors reported in Treasury's 1996-97 Budget calculations, with key deficit estimates out by up to A$5 billion.  The corrections show a rise n the general Government deficit to A$9.3 billion, up from the A$8 billion estimate one month ago. Page 1.</p>
<p>-- New South Wales Law Society president Patrick Fair has suggested solicitors' fees may need to rise because of fears that the Society's A$28 million fund for the compensation of lawyers' clients may be inadequate.  Fair declined to say how much the fees, currently at A$445 a year for every solicitor in the State, would increase. Page 3.</p>
<p>-- THE AGE</p>
<p>Victorian Auditor-General Ches Baragwanath yesterday criticised any attempts by the Kennett Government to "muzzle" his office, saying Victorians and Parliament should have protection if they face a corrupt Government.  Baragwanath said new moves to bypass his office could cause "irreparable long-term damage" to the governance of Victoria's public sector. Page A1.</p>
<p>-- Former Labor Party member and now Independent Senator Mal Colston is facing a new set of allegations from his former party.  The Labor Party claims that in his position as a member on the Australian National University Board, Colston tried to have his son's university exams re-marked.  Amid the allegations, the Federal Government is set to receive a report this morning on at least some of the allegations made about Colston's use of allowances. Page A1.</p>
<p>-- Confidential documents show the Papua New Guinea Government considered hiring foreign soldiers to wipe out crime in the country ahead of national elections this year, but instead opted to appoint African-based mercenaries to intervene in Bougainville.  The introduction of the mercenaries has caused a political rift between Papua New Guinea and Australia, with Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer yesterday summoning the Papua New Guinean high commissioner. Page A1.</p>
<p>-- Under a Finance Department plan, a further 5000 Federal public service jobs are on the line in this year's Budget.  The nationwide cuts could be on top of the 10,500 positions already lost this financial year, and could see the Commonwealth Public Serviceemploying fewer than 120,000 staff by mid-1998. Page A1.</p>
