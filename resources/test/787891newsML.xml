<p>The Teamsters union and United Parcel Service resumed talks on Friday as the White House again urged them to settle the strike that has crippled the world's largest package delivery company.</p>
<p>Negotiators for both sides will pick up where they left off after 10-1/2 hours of talks that started Thursday but produced little progress.</p>
<p>"No significant progress was made," UPS negotiator Dave Murray said as he arrived for the latest round of talks. He emphasised that UPS was sticking to its bargaining position. "We feel it's a great offer," he said.</p>
<p>Teamsters President Ron Carey simply said "No" when asked if there had been progress on specific issues Thursday. "The company seems to be stuck on its proposal," he said.</p>
<p>With the strike in its fifth day, Clinton and Labour Secretary Alexis Herman continued to pressure the two sides to compromise.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Mike McCurry said "the president urges them to redouble their efforts and work hard to try and settle their dispute."</p>
<p>Herman said in a statement that she had talked to Carey and UPS Chairman James Kelly on Friday and urged them keep talking and "finish the job."</p>
<p>The Teamsters have blamed the strike on the company's refusal to create more full-time jobs each year for the three in five union workers at UPS who are now part-time.</p>
<p>UPS said the real issue was the Teamsters' refusal to let the company withdraw from a union pension plan that includes 30 other companies. UPS says running its own plan would save money.</p>
<p>The walkout has choked off the delivery of nearly 12 million packages a day across the United States, hitting the mail order catalogue business especially hard, as well as deliveries of some medical supplies.</p>
<p>The governors of Iowa and Virginia have asked Clinton to intervene. Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa said he was particularly concerned about the impact that the 5-day-old strike was having on the delivery of medical supplies.</p>
<p>Gov. George Allen of Virginia said many of the jobs created in Virginia recently had been at mail order companies.</p>
<p>But there was little indication that Clinton was inclined to do more than try to talk the parties into a settlement.</p>
<p>Clinton said Wednesday there would have to be "severe damage" to the country before he could halt the strike under the rarely used Taft-Hartley industrial relations law. McCurry repeated Friday that the president would not intervene.</p>
<p>The union estimated UPS was losing $35 million a day in profits. UPS spokeswoman Gina Ellrich said the company had no precise estimate, but that it was losing "tens of millions of dollars a day."</p>
<p>But the union also may be hurting financially.</p>
<p>A Wall Street Journal report said that at the start of the year the Teamsters had net assets of only $17 million, with strike benefits to UPS members running at $10 million a week.</p>
<p>"We'll do whatever we have to do," said Carey when asked about the report.</p>
<p>Since the strike began, UPS has been handling less than 10 percent of its normal shipments, using 50,000 non-union employees to do the work of striking loaders, sorters and drivers.</p>
<p>The company has 300,000 workers, more than 200,000 represented by the union.</p>
