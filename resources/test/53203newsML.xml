<p>Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has launched an anti-corruption campaign he says will keep the poor from burning down the property of the rich. Diplomats and his opponents say it is his latest ploy at power politics.</p>
<p>The Libyan leader announced in June that army officers would spearhead a war on corruption and smuggling. "Purification" committees have targeted goldsmiths, money exchange bureaus and export and import shops.</p>
<p>He vowed at the beginning of September to launch hundreds more committees of army and police officers and university students to "clean up" Libya.</p>
<p>An important trade and foreign currency black market has developed in Libya as a result of U.N. sanctions imposed in 1992 for its failure to hand over for trial in the United States or Britain two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am plane over Scotland.</p>
<p>The government decided after the sanctions not to finance imports other than essential foodstuffs and equipment and not to allow citizens foreign currency for travel abroad.</p>
<p>Since the start of the "purification" sweep, security forces have closed down dozens of shops and arrested scores of traders, shop owners and a senior government official.</p>
<p>In the latest of his renowned impromptu speeches to the Libyan masses on September 2, Gaddafi painted a picture of Robin Hood-style "purification committees" which would take from the super rich to give to the indigent.</p>
<p>"The purification committees will tell whoever has three houses that he should only have one and ask him from where he got the other two and then give them to those who don't own houses," Gaddafi said.</p>
<p>"Whoever has 10 cars outside his house will take two or three cars and the rest will be distributed to families who don't have cars...If it weren't for the purification law and committees, the poor -- particularly if I incited them -- would burn down all the palaces, shops, farms and large cars in one night," he added.</p>
<p>The anti-corruption drive has been extended into Libya's oil sector, which generates around $8 billion a year for the North African country. The Libyan news agency JANA has said the sweep could affect oil exports.</p>
<p>Not everyone is convinced of Gaddafi's good intentions. A member of the Libyan opposition in exile in Egypt told Reuters the purification law and committees, which Gaddafi has paraded as creations of the "masses", are his way of removing cohorts who have become too powerful.</p>
<p>"These committees are a tool he is using to change his men and to be in control. In his speech he attacked the rich and threatened to set the poor against them. Who created the rich and the poor in Libya? How can there be poor in Libya when the country makes $8 billion a year from oil?" he said.</p>
<p>"He (Gaddafi) is the one who creates the poor and the rich. He always gives the message that I create you and I can destroy you. It's a silly game," he added.</p>
<p>Gaddafi came to power 27 years ago as a young army officer who headed a coup that toppled King Mohammed Idriss to establish a quasi-socialist state where resources are owned by the people, who rule themselves through a system of nationwide committees.</p>
<p>A diplomat in Tripoli said Gaddafi could be trying to assert his control over the relatively influential mercantile class.</p>
<p>"We can't really figure out what the economic logic behind all of this is. It doesn't make sense, it's unfathomable. It seems to be done for political reasons as much as anything else," the diplomat told Reuters.</p>
<p>"It's an indication of heavy-handedness from the regime wanting to stamp its authority on Tripoli. The Tripoli merchant classes have long been sort of outside Gaddafi's power base -- a part of Libyan society that he has to keep sweet but at the same time he has to show them who's boss," he added.</p>
