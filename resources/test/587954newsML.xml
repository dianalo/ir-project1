<p>New earthquake-proof buildings are needed quickly in threatened cities and older buildings should be upgraded fast, an expert said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Engineers and city planners should act before the lessons learned in the Japanese city of Kobe fade, Adrian Chandler, a civil engineer at University College London, said.</p>
<p>The January 1995 Kobe earthquake killed 6,000 people and caused $130 billion worth of damage, but would not be unique, Chandler wrote in a commentary for the science journal Nature.</p>
<p>"There is little doubt that an earthquake with similar destructive force could, and probably will, hit Tokyo within the next 20 years," Chandler wrote.</p>
<p>"The damage levels in pre-1971 buildings in the worst-hit parts of Kobe are representative of those to be expected in any future earthquake in a large Japanese or U.S. city, and in other earthquake-prone regions of the world."</p>
<p>It was not too expensive to build a new quake-resistant building, but of course no city could afford to replace all its buildings.</p>
<p>"The urgent need to upgrade the older, badly designed building stock is evident in all of the main earthquake zones in the world," Chandler said.</p>
<p>"There is a widespread view among engineers that owners and developers must demonstrate greater willingness in the future to pay for proper engineering design and construction to ensure a safe structure," he warned.</p>
<p>"Action is required sooner rather than later to prevent a repeat in other earthquake-threatened cities."</p>
<p>For instance, he said, using rubber bearings at the base of columns holding up buildings could help -- the only two such buildings in Kobe survived the quake, although they were a long way from the epicentre.</p>
<p>But the use of reinforced steel was being questioned, as many of the buildings that succumbed in Kobe had severe damage to welded steel plates.</p>
<p>Chandler wrote before Saturday's earthquake in north-east Iran, which killed more than 1,500 people.</p>
