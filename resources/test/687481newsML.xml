<p>The Belgian VTM commercial TV channel will claim 15 to 20 billion francs ($421 and $562 million) in damages from the Flemish regional government if it loses its advertising monopoly, chairman Rik De Nolf said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The European Commission is expected to tell Belgium on Thursday it must scrap the advertising monopoly granted to VTM or face legal action.</p>
<p>"That would mean that damages will be asked for breaching the agreement which was based on an 18-year exclusive right to advertising income from television in Flanders," De Nolf told BRTN radio.</p>
<p>"The amount could be between 15 and 20 billion francs, or even more," he said.</p>
<p>VTM is 44 percent owned by Dutch publishing group VNU .</p>
<p>In 1989 VTM was given an 18-year advertising monopoly for Dutch-speaking Flanders, in northern Belgium, which has been attacked by rival channel VT4 owned by Nasdaq-listed TV group Scandinavian Broadcasting System (SBS) .</p>
<p>VT4 has been forced to set up headquarters in London to circumvent VTM's monopoly and to be able to broadcast to Flanders.</p>
<p>The channel started operations in February 1995 despite the opposition of the Flemish regional government and took the issue to the Commission the same year.</p>
