<p>Turkey has urged President Saddam Hussein to reassert his authority in northern Iraq and crush separatist Turkish Kurds based there, to the dismay of the United States, which wants to keep Saddam boxed in, The New York Times reported on Saturday.</p>
<p>The newspaper, in an interview with Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller, quoted her as saying Ankara would drop its plan to create a "security zone" inside Iraq if Saddam took steps to crush Turkish Kurds waging a guerrilla war against Ankara from camps in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>Ciller said Turkey was having talks with Saddam on the issue.</p>
<p>"We are still talking to him, and we are interested to see what he can do or is prepared to do. If he can establish a degree of rule there that puts an end to terrorist infiltration, that would be fine with us.</p>
<p>"If not, we will take measures to see that terrorists do not continue to operate on our borders. We defend the territorial integrity of Iraq, but the lack of authority there has been tragic for us," Ciller said.</p>
<p>The New York Times said senior U.S. administration officials were "dismayed" by Ciller's remarks. It quoted a senior State Department official as saying: "This does not accord with the discussions the United States has had with Turkey. Perhaps it is Turkey's way of signalling to the Unite States that it has alternatives."</p>
<p>Turkey announced plans early in September to create a security zone in northern Iraq up to six miles (9.6 km) deep, and Washington said it would not object if Ankara went ahead with the scheme.</p>
<p>Turkey said the cordon would deter infiltration from Iraq by guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), fighting for self-rule in Turkey's Kurdish southeast.</p>
<p>The Turkish plan followed U.S. missile strikes on military installations in southern Iraq in response to the Iraqi army's intervention in northern Iraq to help a Kurdish faction seize a city from a rival group a week ago.</p>
<p>Ciller did not say if Turkey wanted Saddam to send his own troops back into northern Iraq or influence his Kurdish allies to do the job of pushing out PKK forces.</p>
<p>For the past five years, Iraqi forces have been barred from the northern part of Iraq, where the United States and its allies established a safe haven for Kurds after the Gulf War.</p>
<p>But Kurdish authorities in the enclave have been unwilling or unable to close Turkish separatist Kurdistan Workers Party camps there.</p>
<p>The Times said the emerging policy differences suggested that relations between Turkey and the United States may be entering a new and possibly difficult phase in the wake of recent power shifts in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The United States is seeking to limit Saddam's power and prevent him from disrupting the flow of oil from the Middle East to Western industrial nations.</p>
