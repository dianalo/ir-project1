<p>Gabriela Sabatini announced her retirement from professional tennis on Thursday with the same grace and dignity that marked her 12-year career.</p>
<p>Wearing a short white dress, the dark-haired, sultry Sabatini never shed a tear in saying goodbye to the sport in which she won the 1990 U.S. Open and 26 other singles titles.</p>
<p>"I don't want this to be a sad moment," the 26-year-old Argentine tennis star told a news conference at Madison Square Garden. "In a way it will be sad because you won't be watching me play tennis anymore.</p>
<p>"This is what I want to do for my life. This is what I want from life. This is what makes me happy."</p>
<p>Sabatini played her last match last week, losing to Jennifer Capriati 6-3, 6-4 in the first round of the European Indoor Championships in Zurich, Switzerland. She had been scheduled to play in WTA Tour events in Chicago and Philadelphia next month.</p>
<p>"I have been thinking about this for more than five months," Sabatini said. "It was just a matter of knowing when...this was the right time for me to do."</p>
<p>Ranked in the world's top 10 from 1986 to 1995, Sabatini's results had fallen off dramatically this year as her ranking slipped to No. 29. Her last tournament title came 22 months ago at Sydney, Australia.</p>
<p>Sabatini had been sidelined by a stomach injury for four months this year, missing both the French Open and Wimbledon. She returned at the Atlanta Olympics where she was knocked out by Monica Seles in the quarter-finals and lost at the U.S. Open in the third round.</p>
<p>But her poor results had nothing to do with her decision to quit, according to her and her business manager Dick Dell.</p>
<p>"I think it is deeper with her than that," said Dell. "Tennis has been the most important thing for her and perhaps today it is not the most important thing."</p>
<p>"She had been doing this for a long time, for half of her life and I think she just felt that she didn't have time for other things and she wanted to have that time," Dell said. "She just felt that her tennis career had come full circle."</p>
<p>But there are gaps in her career. Her one and only Grand Slam singles title came at the 1990 U.S. Open, when she beat Steffi Graf 6-2 7-6. But instead of ending the Graf/Seles stranglehold on the women's game, that triumph represented a solitary grand slam peak and since then she reached just one more grand slam final in 1991 at Wimbledon.</p>
<p>"She definitely could have won more grand slams for sure," Seles told reporters on Tuesday. "I don't know why she didn't, she had so much talent. Some of the volleys she could hit were unbelievable. It was just pure talent and great touch."</p>
<p>Sabatini, though, offered no regrets for her results.</p>
<p>"Looking back I'm very proud of what I've done," Sabatini said. "I gave it my all, and that is all I can ask of myself."</p>
<p>Sabatini won nearly $9 million in prize money during her tennis career, but it is impossible to put a figure on what she meant to women's tennis said Seles.</p>
<p>"She was one of the very few players who was a great competitor, but as soon as she came off the court she was a normal person," said Seles. "I also think she has this aura that she just hides when you see here. She has something that brings the best out in every single person."</p>
<p>With her father Osvaldo and mother Beatriz sitting in the front row, Sabatini promised that she would not disappear from sight and plans to launch a third brand of perfume next year.</p>
<p>"You will be seeing me, I'll be doing a lot of things," said Sabatini, who took singing lessons while being sidelined this year, fuelling speculation that she is considering a new career as a pop singer.</p>
<p>Would she ever consider renewing her tennis career? Dell dosen't think so.</p>
<p>"I never say never," said Dell, "and I don't think she would totally, totally, totally, totally close that door, but I think today she really feels that her career has come to a conclusion and that she wants to move on."</p>
