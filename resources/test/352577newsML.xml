<p>The Queensland state government had received 19 private sector expressions of interest in developing north Queensland's untapped Surat Basin coal potential, state trade minister Doug Slack said.</p>
<p>"Under the supervision of the Queensland Government, the private sector is prepared to provide vital infrastructure including railway lines, water storage management, coal mines and power generation," Slack said in a statement.</p>
<p>The Queensland Government earlier had invited expressions of interest from local and overseas companies to develop the Surat Basin's estimated 4.1 billion tonnes of steaming coal.  </p>
<p>The latest expressions of interest included bids from companies and consortiums in Australia and overseas, Slack said.</p>
<p>Government plans for the Surat Basin and nearby Dawson Valley, west of Toowoomba would trigger the region's progress as Queensland's "new frontier," Slack said.</p>
<p>"Providing the necessary infrastructure will unleash the massive potential of the region as a producer of coal, energy and agriculture," Slack said.</p>
