<p>Montenegro's Adriatic port Luka Bar has signed two deals with foreign shipping companies this week opening new international container lines, the Bar port said in a statement faxed to Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>The first deal was signed with the U.S. company Sealand and the second with Germany's Hapag Lloyd, which rank among the top container transporters in the world, the statement said.</p>
<p>Both companies will regularly, once in every fifteen days, dock in the port of Bar with container services planned to start at the end of July.</p>
<p>Cooperation with Sealand is of particular importance for the Montenegrin port because it will link Luka Bar and its business partners with a network of nearly 100 ports to which the U.S. company sails, Luka Bar said.</p>
<p>Sealand's agent for Yugoslavia is Moko-marketing company of Belgrade while Hapag Lloyd will be represented by Jugexpress, also of Belgrade. -- Amra Kevic, Belgrade newsroom +381 11 311 4305</p>
