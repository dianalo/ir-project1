<p>Toronto stocks tumbled with Wall Street on Thursday, as fear of rising interest rates and lofty stock prices prompted heavy selling.</p>
<p>The TSE 300 Composite Index sank 91.40 points to close at 6165.81, extending its recent slide. The key index lost 48 points on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Trading was heavy with 89.5 million shares changing hands worth C$1.3 billion ($950 million).</p>
<p>"We have a combination of markets discounting 1997 earnings and the risk of higher interest rates in the United States," said CIBC Wood Gundy chief strategist Subodh Kumar.</p>
<p>All but one of Toronto's 14 sub-groups lost ground at the close of trading on Thursday. The heaviest losses were in communications, consumer products and conglomerates.</p>
<p>Canada's major banks also continued to selloff after hitting record highs in recent months. The only gaining sector was gold, up a meager 20 points.</p>
<p>Stronger-than-expected U.S. retail sales data on Thursday heightened fears that the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise interest rates to ward off inflation. Looking ahead on the TSE, Kumar said: "I think we're still in a pull-back phase."</p>
<p>--- HOT STOCKS ---</p>
<p>* BioChem Pharma Inc. was the top net loser, sinking 8.10 to 70.50 after the biotechnology firm reported disappointing fourth quarter results on Wednesday.</p>
<p>* Bre-Minerals Ltd. led heavy traders, falling 0.30 to 17.25 on 2.9 million shares. Other big traders included Petro-Canada, down 0.35 to 19.80 on 2.4 million shares, and BCE Inc. which fell 2.30 to 65.80 on 1.2 million shares.</p>

<p>* Cobre Mining Co. jumped 4.49 to 5.00 on 1.2 million shares after a merger with Aurex Resources Corp. was approved by the Toronto Stock Exchange on Thursday.</p>
