<p>Kemet Corp on Monday said it was earmarking $72 million in fiscal 1998 to expand its production capacity and meet increasing demand.</p>
<p>The electronics components maker said capacity expansion has brought steady improvement in revenues and earnings since the first quarter ended June 30 in spite of lower selling prices throughout the industry.</p>
<p>"This accelerated rate of decline in selling prices has begun to moderate as customer demand increases, and we expect the industry to be back to normal rates of decline during fiscal 1998," the company said in a release.</p>
