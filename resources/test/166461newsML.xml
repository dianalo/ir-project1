<p>South Korean President Kim Young Sam will visit Malaysia later this month to improve bilateral ties, Seoul's ambassador to Kuala Lumpur was quoted as saying on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Kim's three-day visit from November 26 comes after a number of joint ventures have been proposed between Malaysia and South Korea in the shipbuilding, cement manufacturing and electronics industries, Jhung Kyung-yil was quoted saying by Malaysia's Bernama news agency.</p>
<p>Jhung told a news conference in Kuala Lumpur that South Korea is the fifth largest foreign investor in Malaysia and the country's 10th largest trading partner.</p>
<p>Five South Korean companies had this year alone invested almost $700 million to set up manufacturing plants for steel pipes, televisions and commercial vehicles in Malaysia, he said.</p>
<p>Bilateral trade totalled $5.5 billion last year.</p>
