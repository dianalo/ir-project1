<p>The Dow Jones industrial average sprinted through the 8,000 milestone Wednesday, buoyed by big gains in technology stocks and more good news on inflation.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT), the 30-stock Dow was up 29.03 points at 8,004.74.</p>
<p>In the broader market, advancing issues led declines 2-1 on heavy volume of 371 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index, which is laced with technology shares, jumped 27.57 points to 1,569.68.</p>
<p>The Dow forged ahead despite a big drop in the stock of component Eastman Kodak Co., which posted disappointing quarterly results. Kodak tumbled 8 to 67-7/8.</p>
<p>The spolight was on giant computer chip maker Intel Corp.'s solid quarterly earnings reports, whose stock gained 4-27/32 to 85-3/4.</p>
<p>"Nasdaq stocks are leading the way, earnings have been relatively good apart from Kodak, there's momentum and interest rates keep coming down," said Warren Epstein, director of trading at Richard Rosenblatt.</p>
<p>The stock market also got a lift from bonds, which jumped on news that consumer prices rose just 0.1 percent in June, rising at their slowest pace in 11 years in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 24/32, or $7.50 on a $1,000 bond, lowering its yield to 6.49 percent from 6.55 percent at Tuesday's close. Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions.</p>
<p>"The data this morning was incredibly favourable," said Chris Dickerson, an analyst at Global Market Strategists.</p>
<p>"Sightings of inflation are as rare as sightings of unicorns."</p>
<p>The technology sector had an euphoric tone after Intel Corp., the world's largest producer of microprocessors, reported second-quarter earnings of 92 cents a share, up from 59 cents a share in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Microsoft Corp., which is due to report its earnings Thursday, gained 7-27/32 to 146-5/16. Compaq Computer Corp. rose 2-1/8 to 129-1/2 and Sun Microsystems Inc. was up 2-9/16 to 44-1/8.</p>
<p>"In this market, people are afraid to sell, afraid of being left behind," said Edgar Peters, chief investment strategist &amp; director, asset allocation at PanAgora Asset Management Inc. "But the techs are still reasonably valued because their growth rates are high."</p>
<p>Drug stocks fell after Pfizer Corp. reported slightly lower-than-expected earnings. Pfizer shed 2-1/4 to 59-7/16 and Dow component Merck &amp; Co. lost 1-9/16 to 99.</p>
<p>ITT Corp. stock gained 5-1/8 to 67-3/4. The company said it would split into three separate companies to fend off a takeover bid from rival Hilton Hotels Corp.</p>
