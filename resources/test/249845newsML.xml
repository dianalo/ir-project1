<p>The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) said it declared two member-brokers of the exchange as defaulters after they failed to honour commitments.</p>
<p>"(The two brokers) have failed to meet their obligations to the exchange and to discharge their liabilities," the BSE said in a statement issued on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The two brokers are Mukesh Mansukhlal Kothari and Yogesh Mehta.</p>
<p>"All clients of the above mentioned defaulter members are requested to file their claims, if any, within six months," the BSE statement said.</p>
<p>On Monday, the National Stock Exchange (NSE) declared three members as defaulters after they failed to meet their obligations.</p>
<p>Traders say a recent slump in stock prices, triggered by dismal first half company results and grim prospects, saddled market players with huge losses.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-share BSE index has plummeted about 33 percent from its year's peak in June to three year lows.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the index finished 16.49 points, or 0.59 percent, lower at 2,798.57.</p>
