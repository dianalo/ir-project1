<p>Russia's largest oil company LUKoil expects non-strategic investors to buy a 15 percent stake of government-owned stock in the form of American Depositary Receipts by the end of the year, a top offical said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"We expect this 15 percent to be in the form of level-three ADRs (American Depositary Receipts)," LUKoil Vice President Leonid Fedun and head of securities at LUKoil told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>"I'm not looking for a strategic investor -- I'm looking for financial investors."  </p>
<p>Fedun said terms had not been settled and discussions with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on the ADR issue might last until August or September while auditors completed the necessary three years of international standard accounts.</p>
<p>"By the plan, the privatisation should be by the end of the year -- but not much sooner."</p>
<p>Fedun said the 15 percent stake probably would be sold in a commercial tender with investment conditions and anticipated that a consortium or consortia of Russian and foreign banks would win the tender and redistribute the shares in ADR form.</p>
<p>He said that foreigners and Russians would be allowed to bid for the stake, which he said would become a global depositary receipt trading on exchanges around the world, though he said LUKoil would prefer domestic investors.</p>
<p>Japanese investors may be targeted, Fedun said, though he declined to give details. "We already have specific talks with specific people," he said, adding that an agreement with the Japanese could be reached by the middle of the year.</p>
<p>Auction terms would name a specific investment in LUKoil, which Fedun declined to estimate, and the government would get proceeds dependent upon the sale price.</p>
<p>"It is absolutely open. Whoever gives the highest bid gets the shares," he said.</p>
<p>But Fedun said that plans to issue options for just under five percent of government-owned stock were facing bureaucratic problems. He said LUKoil still supported the plan.</p>
<p>"We want to make a different type of trading instrument...which offers the ability to decrease investment risk."</p>
<p>LUKoil expects to issue level-one Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) based on existing LUKoil ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange in April.</p>
<p>"London is more liberal than America," he said. LUKoil is pressing to increase liquidity by offering a number of trading instruments and venues. But he said Russians may be large purchasers of GDRs.</p>
<p>"The larger the market, the larger the circle of investors," he said.</p>
<p>But LUKoil will not issue a Eurobond until next year at the earliest, he said.</p>
<p>"Only the weak (Russian) companies are trying to issue Eurobonds now, which is bad to my mind...We are not hurrying -- it will not be this year," he said.</p>
<p>But he said the company valued the idea of offering LUKoil instruments to fixed-income investors.</p>
