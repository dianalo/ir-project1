<p>The State Department's official spokesman on Wednesday ridiculed a cable the department had sent to its ambassador in Albania, urging her to take good care of embassy silverware if she had to flee the country.</p>
<p>The cable, leaked to the Washington Post, advised Marisa Lino, U.S. envoy in the riot-torn Balkan state, of the State Department's "policy for safeguarding of sterling silver flatware (cutlery) on the occasion of an evacuation."</p>
<p>It said the embassy should consider safeguarding the silverware at the ambassador's residence or in the chancery, or, if the mission were closed altogether, should ship it out with the personal effects of the ambassador or her deputy.</p>
<p>"Of all the ridiculous things, to send that cable out to her when she's trying to preserve people's lives, to say 'preserve the silverware' -- I think she probably gave it the back of her hand," said spokesman Nicholas Burns.</p>
<p>"It was kind of the height of folly and irony to see that cable sent out the way it was."</p>
<p>In recent days Lino has presided over the evacuation of hundreds of Americans and other foreigners by U.S. military helicopters, as Albania has plunged into anarchy in the wake of a financial scandal.</p>
<p>The cable was signed "Albright", but Burns noted that all cables to foreign missions bore the signature of Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, whether or not she had seen them.</p>
<p>It was apparently sent by the interior design and furnishings division, an office in a State Department administrative section dealing with overseas buildings.</p>
