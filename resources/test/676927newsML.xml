<p>Moroccan Finance Minister Mohamed Kabbaj on Friday said the country is expected to drain at least $1.0 billion foreign investments by end 1997 from an average annual $500 million, the official news agency MAP reported.</p>
<p>Quoting Kabbaj as saying, MAP said: "Morocco has created a framework favouring foreign investments through a new trade, an active privatisation programme and other financial tools".</p>
<p>Kabbaj was addressing a two-day seminar on investments in Africa, co-hosted by Morocco and the United Nations Conference for Trade and Development, held in the central city of Fez and attended by about 100 countries, MAP said.</p>
<p>African countries "had to take a common stand" to attract more direct private investments which remain extremely modest at around $4.5 billion per year for the whole continent or less than 1.5 percent of overall international investments.</p>
