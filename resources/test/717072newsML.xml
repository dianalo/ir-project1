<p>The Philippine peso is the latest victim of regional currency speculation but cries of foreign conspiracy are no more valid now than during European currency crises of the early 1990s, London analysts said.</p>
<p>Philippine president Fidel Ramos registered official concern about market turbulence on Wednesday when he said there was a deliberate foreign campaign to undermine the peso.</p>
<p>This followed press speculation in Singapore about an imminent devaluation.</p>
<p>Yet analysts said conspiracy theories held little water.</p>
<p>"The view of currency speculation always depends on which side of the fence you're on," said Paul Meggyesi, senior currency economist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>"Market players will always cite a fundamental inconsistancy that deems the exchange rate unsustainable, while politicians tend to like the idea of darker forces."</p>
<p>Traders said there may be a little truth in both views but the fact that currency markets move on bandwagons may be the most accurate view of all -- in the short term at least.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Philippine peso ended local trading at 26.39 per dollar, 0.1 percent below Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>But this was only after the Philippine central bank sold more than $500 million for pesos and held overnight interest rates at a punitive 30 percent to stabilise the currency.</p>
<p>The fact that average daily turnover in the peso market is usually little more than $700-to-$800 million illustrates the extent of the intervention, market analysts said.</p>
<p>They said the failure of the Thai central bank to prevent an effective devaluation of the baht over the last month had intensified investor concern about the stability of many south east Asian markets, which have attracted heavy inflows of foreign capital in recent years.</p>
<p>Apart from problems created by a regional boost to Thai exports from the baht devaluation, the Thai crisis focused market attention on the sustainability of exchange rate targets back to back with large balance of payments deficits and foreign currency debt.</p>
<p>Analysts argue that if the overseas funding of a country's current account deficit is increasingly short-term and official reserves are not sufficient to offset any disturbance to this flow, the exchange rate is forced take up the slack.</p>
<p>The surge in May of the Japanese yen, in which much of Thailand's liabilities were denominated, probably contributed to the latest shockwaves.</p>
<p>However, analysts said the latest bout of pressure on the peso had much to do with capital seeping from the local asset markets rather than outright currency speculation, conspiracies or concerted attacks.</p>
<p>Traders said some U.S. funds had gone short of pesos on fears that the Thai problems would be contagious. But the expense of covering these positions in such an illiquid market means this a very high risk bet.</p>
<p>"It seems to me that a lot of the selling in pesos is due to people getting out of assets more than simply going short of the currency. This will create more problems defending it," said Nick Douch, corporate risk adviser at BZW.</p>
<p>The Philippine stock exchange fell more than four percent on Wednesday, recording its biggest one-day fall in three months.</p>
<p>Douch said the illiquidity of the peso relative to the Thai baht, for example, and the lack of a deliverable currency forward market meant official restrictions on overseas access to these markets were not much of an additional defence.</p>
<p>Use of non-deliverable currency forwards, usually deliverable in dollars, is an increasingly common way of playing these markets. Yet, while avoiding central bank restrictions on access to local currency, the price of these instruments often becomes prohibitive as the risk of a devaluation builds.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, while preventing speculation in the short term, analysts said the choice of a high interest rate defence of the peso might well be its undoing.</p>
<p>"I think contagion effects in these currencies may be a bit overdone but the high interest rate policy is a mistake and ultimately the peso make have to give way," said Chris Tinker, international economist at Standard Chartered.</p>
<p>Tinker said higher interest rates often see foreign money seeping out of the longer-term asset markets and into short-term interest rate accounts. This hurts confidence in the stock markets and ultimately the money leaves altogether when rates eventually come down.</p>
