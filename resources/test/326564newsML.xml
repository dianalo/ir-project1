<p>China's central government could buy up to 400,000 tonnes of white sugar from the domestic market for its reserves to bolster the country's flagging sugar prices, sugar traders in Hong Kong and China said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The government should, in the coming 30 days, buy around 400,000 tonnes for their reserves, but the news is not confirmed yet," said a Hong Kong sugar source.</p>
<p>Other sugar traders said the amount would be between 200,000 tonnes to 300,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Some traders said the purchases were already under way.  </p>
<p>The price of ex-factory white sugar in Guangxi was quoted at 3,800 yuan ($458) a tonne, unchanged from last week.</p>
<p>The government purchase could possibly prevent a repeat of the situation around this time last year when domestic sugar prices dipped to 3,600 yuan ($434) a tonne, shortly after the Chinese Lunar New Year holiday, industry sources said.</p>
<p>But the sources doubted the government buying programme would provide much of a boost to prices.</p>
<p>"I don't think it'll touch 3,600 yuan ($434) a tonne this year, and 4,000 yuan ($482) a tonne is a reasonable level," one sugar trader said.  </p>
<p>He said domestic prices could edge up to 4,100 yuan ($494) a tonne after May but 4,400 yuan ($530) was unlikely.</p>
<p>Premiums for Thai raw sugar for March/May delivery were quoted at about 0.30/0.40 cents (bid/offer) per pound over New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange (CSCE) FOB basis.</p>
<p>May/July delivery was quoted at 0.40/0.47 cents over New York futures, while July/Sept was 0.70/0.85 cents.</p>
