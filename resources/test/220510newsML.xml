<p>The United States is seeking an urgent World Trade Organisation finding on whether the European Union is violating open trade rules with its 15-month-old grain tariffs system, diplomats said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They cited a U.S. request for establishment of a WTO dispute panel as saying the issue was "a case of urgency" because it involved perishable goods -- even though intermittent talks with Brussels have been under way since late 1995.</p>
<p>The WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB) is meeting on December 3, and under its statutes will automatically agree to a panel because the United States has already sought one once, on October 11 last year.</p>
<p>Although the original request made no reference to urgency, the latest -- submitted to the EU mission in Geneva and the WTO last Friday -- said Washington was invoking a fast-track DSB procedure under which a finding is returned within three months.</p>
<p>Normally WTO dispute panels, made up of three neutral experts, are expected to issue their conclusions within six months.</p>
<p>These are then subject to challenge by either side before an appeals panel, which is expected to report within three months.</p>
<p>In its request, cited by the diplomats, the Geneva office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) argued that urgency was also justified because earlier creation of a panel "was delayed on the basis of commitments by the European Communities (Union) that have not been fulfilled...."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the European Commission in Brussels said it was surprised Washington had revived the complaint -- centred on a reference price system for tariffs on wheat, rye, barley, corn sorghum and rice -- at this stage.</p>
<p>A Commission agriculture spokesman said discussions were still under way with U.S. officials on the problem, and that further technical talks were planned.</p>
<p>The discussions, part of the WTO's dispute settlement process, got under way after the EU exercised its right in October last year to block the first U.S. panel request.</p>
<p>There was no immediate comment from the U.S. mission to the WTO, but diplomats said the Washington view appeared to be that Brussels was dragging out the talks to try to avoid having to submit a case to a panel.</p>
<p>When the United States first raised the issue last year, Commission spokesman Gerrard Kiely said Brussels would defend the system. "We consider it is totally in compliance with WTO (rules)," he said.</p>
<p>Washington says the system runs against agreements on agricultural trade reached during the 1986-93 Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations.</p>
<p>It says EU grain import tariffs, to conform to the rules, should be calculated on a shipment-by-shipment basis, but Brussels has argued that this would be impossible to control and open to fraud.</p>
<p>Canada took the EU to the WTO on a similar issue last year and a panel was set up. But it was suspended after the two sides said they had worked out a mutually-satisfactory settlement, details of which were not revealed.</p>
