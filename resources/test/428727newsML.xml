<p>A month after President Bill Clinton presented his budget proposal it is languishing in Congress and serious negotiations with Republicans on a deal to balance the federal budget have yet to begin.</p>
<p>Instead, the Democratic White House and the Republican Congress are sniping at each other, bringing back memories of their spectacular failure to reach agreement last year that briefly closed the federal government.</p>
<p>While no one is talking about closing the government again, the pledges of a cooperative, bipartisan approach have gone nowhere.</p>
<p>Republicans want Clinton to submit a new budget, saying his current plan does not reach balance in 2002. A resolution is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives in the next few days calling on Clinton to submit a new budget, a congressional aide said.</p>
<p>The White House, meanwhile, says its budget does reach balance in 2002; the president would not submit a new proposal and Republicans should either present their own plan or work off Clinton's current budget.</p>
<p>"We have the only budget in town," Lawrence Haas, Office of Management and Budget spokesman, said. "If the other side wants to complain about our budget, we would challenge them to put up their own ... We will not be submitting an additional budget."</p>
<p>Informal talks were taking place between administration officials and Republican and Democratic leaders, but they have some distance to go before reaching the stage of formal negotiations, congressional and administration aides said.</p>
<p>"It remains at the conversation state, negotiation would be a vast overstatement," an administration aide said.</p>
<p>A testy Senate Republican Leader Trent Lott said on Thursday that if progress was not made soon on ironing out budget differences, it would be difficult to reach a deal.</p>
<p>A congressional deadline for issuing a budget blueprint for the fiscal year starting in October is looming on April 15, but it is becoming increasingly unlikely that a budget resolution would be passed by then. House Majority Leader Dick Armey, a Texas Republican, has said a vote on a budget resolution would more likely occur in May.</p>
<p>Lott illustrated another point that has Republicans and the White House in a face-off. The Mississippi Republican proposed a commission to study the shortcomings in the consumer price index (CPI) and said it would be difficult to reach a balanced budget without addressing that issue.</p>
<p>Franklin Raines, White House budget director, said the administration was in no hurry to reach a decision on how to deal with that issue. "There are people who are saying a variety of things ... If there was a common view, then we would be doing it, (but) it turns out there is no common view," Raines said.</p>
<p>CPI-related adjustments are politically sensitive because annual increases in some federal programmes such as Social Security and veterans benefits are tied to the index. So lowering the index would mean a smaller increase in benefits.</p>
<p>A commission headed by economist Michael Boskin late last year said the CPI overstated inflation by about 1.1 percentage points. Adjusting the CPI would make balancing the budget easier because it would lower the costs to the government of the benefits affected. Each party wants the other to take the lead on the issue.</p>
<p>Substantive talks on tax issues will likely wait for the Republicans to decide what they want to do on the budget because that will determine the amount of room for a tax cut.</p>
<p>Clinton's budget calls for $98 billion in tax cuts over five years, offset by about $76 billion. Senate Republicans have proposed almost double that amount of tax cuts, but have not detailed how they would be offset.</p>
<p>Thomas Mann, director of governmental studies at The Brookings Institution, said there would be a budget deal at some point. "I don't think either the president or the Republican majority will be served by picking a fight instead of reaching a deal," he said.</p>
<p>Republicans are in a tough spot, Mann said, because they want large tax cuts, but that will be difficult to accomplish using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projections, which forecast slower economic growth than the White House projects.</p>
<p>"It's very awkward for the Republicans right now because it's very hard to put on the table a plan that uses CBO numbers that includes a big tax cut and that balances (the budget) by 2002, because they're going to have to go after spending that they won't feel very comfortable going after," Mann said.</p>
