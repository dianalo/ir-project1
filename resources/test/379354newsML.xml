<p>Former British foreign secretary Douglas Hurd will chair a working group on UK financial services following the retirement of the chiefs of British Invisibles, the Bank of England said on Friday. The Bank, with the agreement of British Invisibles (BI), the Corporation of London and Scottish Financial Enterprise, has invited Hurd to review the promotion of Britain's financial services and make appropriate recommendations.</p>
<p>British Invisibles is a privately-sponsored body which promotes the international activities of UK-based financial institutions and professional and business services. Its chairman Brian Pearse and director-general Alison Wright are to retire soon but will sit on the working group. The membership of the working group and its executive sub-group will be drawn mainly from members of BI including the Corporation of London.</p>
<p>"The report of the working group will recommend whether any changes are needed to the constitution, ownership, governance and resources of BI," the Bank said.</p>
<p>It said BI's main objectives were to promote financial services in Britain and abroad, to improve access to overseas markets and to improve the statistical reporting of British trade in financial services.</p>
<p>Hurd is deputy chairman of NatWest Markets and deputy chairman of BI.</p>
