<p>World oil prices were steady on Wednesday after U.S. inventory data failed to jumpstart a rally in the gasoline market, normally the market leader for this time of year, analysts said.</p>
<p>Defused crises in Nigeria and Iraq, both members of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), also prevented crude oil prices from recovering much from their 10-month lows hit in early April.</p>
<p>At 1628 GMT, bellwether London Brent crude futures for June delivery traded four cents higher at $18.03 a barrel, briefly cracking the $18 psychological floor.</p>
<p>"I would have thought that the API and DOE figures would have been seen as reasonably positive but the market doesn't seem to be reacting to them at all," said Tony Machacek, an oil broker at Credit Lyonnais Rouse.</p>
<p>"Without gasoline making any move to the upside, the rest of the market is pretty quiet," he added.</p>
<p>The American Petroleum Institute (API), a trade group, said late on Tuesday that U.S. gasoline supplies fell 1.9 million barrels last week and were 8.9 million under a year ago as spring driving starts to kick in.</p>
<p>But the Energy Information Administration (EIA)of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) said on Wednesday that inventories were unchanged last week, and that gasoline demand so far this year has been a meagre 0.5 percent above a year ago.</p>
<p>"The problem was that the DOE report was not as supportive as the APIs," said Charles Gray, an energy analyst at Prudential Bache Futures in London. "Generally the market has been spun around several times and needs a few more days to get its sense of direction."</p>
<p>Indeed, oil traders said they were cautious after Royal Dutch/Shell said it had resumed loadings of its Bonny crude oil in Nigeria after a strike by a contractor's workers ended on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bonny crude makes up roughly half of the 950,000 barrels per day of Shell's Nigerian production and comes on top of disruptions to its output earlier this month caused by local community protests.</p>
<p>Also, the U.S. on Tuesday told Iraq not to use religion to evade international sanctions in defying a "no-fly" zone to transport pilgrims at the Saudi border returning from Mecca. President Bill Clinton gave no indication that the United States would make it pay for defying the United Nations-designated restrictions.</p>
<p>Analysts were wary of predicting further price declines but warned that crude oil supplies looked adequate after a mild Northern Hemisphere winter. The API said U.S. crude stocks were 15.2 million above a year ago.</p>
<p>"I think at the moment the market is a bit oversupplied," said Peter Gignoux, manager of Smith Barney's petroleum desk in London.</p>
