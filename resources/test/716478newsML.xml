<p>Rebuffing (U.S.) President (Bill) Clinton, a divided (U.S.) Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday blocked taking a first step toward regulating hard liquor advertisements on radio and television.</p>
<p>The commission voted 2-2 on opening a proposed inquiry into the controversial issue of hard liquor broadcast advertising. A proposal needs three votes to pass the five-member commission, which currently has one vacancy.</p>
<p>The vote halts, at least for now, a move toward regulating a potential multimillion-dollar annual windfall for the broadcast industry, which for the most part has imposed its own restrictions on accepting hard liquor ads.</p>
<p>Backers of the inquiry refused to accept defeat, saying it could be brought before the FCC again in the future.</p>
<p>FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, who voted in favour of the inquiry, said he would offer "friendly advice" to the hard liquor industry not to interpret the vote as a green light to start a major advertising push.</p>
<p>"I think today's vote was a big defeat for the hard liquor industry and a clear message to broadcasters," Hundt told reporters. "A majority of the commissioners of the FCC said ... we have the authority to conduct this inquiry."</p>
<p>The two commissioners who voted to kill the inquiry said the FCC should cede the issue to the Federal Trade Commission, which is investigating alleged unfair and misleading advertisements by the distilled spirits industry.</p>
<p>One commissioner who opposed FCC action, James Quello, said he might reconsider his position, depending on what action the FTC might take.</p>
<p>The major television networks have agreed not to broadcast hard-liquor ads even though the National Association of Broadcasters dropped its self-imposed ban in 1983. It had been in effect since 1948. The Distilled Liquor Council dropped its opposition to broadcast advertising in 1996.</p>
<p>Since then, about 50 local television stations have begun broadcasting hard liquor ads, the FCC estimates.</p>
<p>Clinton, at least 13 states, 26 members of Congress and 240 citizens groups backed the proposed inquiry, which would seek public comment on the matter and open an FCC study into current industry practices.</p>
<p>The government can regulate the broadcast industry, unlike the print media, on the premise that the airwaves belong to the public.</p>
<p>The two FCC commissioners who opposed the inquiry, Quello and Rachelle Chong, said the FCC would be duplicating FTC efforts.</p>
<p>"The government is already taking appropriate action," Quello said in the FCC meeting. "If it weren't for the FTC's appropriate actions, I would be willing to consider an FCC inquiry."</p>
<p>Hundt and Commissioner Susan Ness voted in favour of the proposal, saying it was necessary in part to protect children from being bombarded with liquor ads.</p>
<p>They also noted that the FTC probe does not invite public comment from citizens group and the hard liquor industry, as the FCC inquiry would.</p>
<p>"The cocktail of hard liquor advertising and broadcast TV is one that a lot of people in this country think should not be poured freely," Hundt said.</p>
