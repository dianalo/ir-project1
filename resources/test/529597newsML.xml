<p>Dutch central bank president Wim Duisenberg told Reuters Financial Television on Tuesday he favoured a money supply growth target as the main target variable for the European Central Bank's monetary policy.</p>
<p>Duisenberg will take over as head of the European Monetary Institute in July and is regarded as a strong candidate to become the first president of the ECB which will supervise the planned launch of the single European currency in 1999.</p>
<p>In an RFTV interview, Duisenberg said that in practice most countries monitored several variables even if they were mainly committed to a money growth target -- such as Germany -- or a direct inflation target -- such as Britain.</p>
<p>The ECB should also monitor a broad range of economic indicators, Duisenberg said, adding that for the sake of clarity he would like special emphasis to be given to the money supply.</p>
<p>"What we do want as a future European Central Bank is to make the policy as understandable and transparent and predictable to the public at large as possible...Starting from those criteria I personally have a slight preference for following a money supply target policy," he said.</p>
