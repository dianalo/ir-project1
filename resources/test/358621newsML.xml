<p>Hordes of mice have invaded the kitchens and servant quarters at Queen Elizabeth's Buckingham Palace.</p>
<p>A Palace spokeswoman on Wednesday confirmed news reports that notices had been pinned up in kitchens and residential areas used by staff telling them to clear away food.</p>
<p>But she said the kitchens where food is prepared for the queen and her husband Prince Philip had not been affected.</p>
<p>"Buckingham Palace is an old and very large building, and from time to time there is a problem with pests like mice. We take the steps necessary to keep it under control," the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>Staff have been told to keep food in boxes or jars and to clear out some cupboards so they can be treated with pest control products.</p>
