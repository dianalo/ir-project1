<p>The steering wheel of a Grand Prix racing car driven by the late world champion Ayrton Senna was sold for 23,000 pounds ($36,000) at an auction of motor racing memorabilia, auctioneers Brooks said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The highest price paid was 26,450 pounds for a white race helmet, one of only four worn by Britain's Stirling Moss during a career which ran from 1947 until his forced retirement in 1962 after a serious accident.</p>
<p>The race overalls worn by world champion Jackie Stewart of Scotland when he won the 1971 Monaco Grand Prix sold for 22,425 pounds, against a pre-auction estimate of 1,800 pounds.</p>
<p>Brazilian Senna signed the steering wheel which he used when he set pole position for the 1986 Portuguese Grand Prix. Senna, a triple world champion, was killed at Imola, Italy, during the 1994 Grand Prix meeting.</p>
<p>The auction took place late on Monday, Brooks said. ($1=.6387 Pound)</p>
