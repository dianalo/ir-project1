<p>Mainstream parties moved on Friday to end the longtime local government role of Basque guerrillas' political wing, accusing it of complicity in the kidnap-murder of a young Spanish politician.</p>
<p>Political leaders in Spain's autonomous Basque region took steps to isolate Herri Batasuna, political arm of the ETA guerrillas, and curb its political clout in retaliation for ETA's assassination of Miguel Angel Blanco.</p>
<p>They manoeuvred to oust one of Herri Batasuna's most powerful local leaders, the mayor in the Basque nationalist stronghold of Mondragon. Similar actions were expected in some other municipalities headed by Herri Batasuna.</p>
<p>Blanco's killing last weekend sparked a countrywide backlash against the Basque separatist movement as around six million people poured into the streets to vent their anger.</p>
<p>Basque region leaders accused Herri Batasuna of being an "accomplice" in the kidnapping and killing of Blanco. The party has declined to condemn ETA.</p>
<p>The Basque Nationalist Party, which heads the regional government, the Socialist party and a third Basque party Eusko Alkartasuna presented a no-confidence motion on Friday against Xabier Zubizarreta, mayor of Mondragon for the past 10 years.</p>
<p>The three parties made a pact earlier in the week to ensure a majority vote to oust the mayor. The vote must be held within 15 days of presenting the motion.</p>
<p>"This is not a solution to the nationalist problems," said Mondragon Deputy Mayor Ino Galparsoro, also a member of Herri Batasuna. "We are going to go on defending the same ideas."</p>
<p>Herri Batasuna, which means Popular Unity in the Basque language Euskera, received about 15 percent of the vote in the last regional elections. It heads 25 of the 251 municipalities in the Basque region, most of them in small villages.</p>
<p>Mondragon is the largest town headed by Herri Batasuna. While the total population of all the municipalities it controls is 56,000, about half of them live in Mondragon.</p>
<p>The party's political ideology is identical to ETA's, envisaging an independent Basque state in parts of northern Spain and southern France.</p>
<p>ETA violence began to rack Spain in 1968 under rightist dictator Francisco Franco, who repressed any sign of Basque nationalism. More than 800 people have been killed since.</p>
<p>Herri Batasuna members, asked about the killing of Blanco in recent interviews, said it was a symptom of the central government's intransigence in refusing to hold a dialogue with ETA until it renounces violence.</p>
<p>Members of Herri Batasuna acknowledged that some soul-searching was in order after the huge public outcry against ETA violence. National spokesman Floren Aoiz said Herri Batasuna was "taking into account" the public reaction.</p>
<p>"We must intensify our political work to find a solution. We will try to break the isolation," he told a news conference in San Sebastian on Thursday.</p>
<p>Angry Basques once intimidated by Herri Batasuna are now openly condemning ETA and its allies. In some cases, crowds have attacked ETA sympathisers and burned Herri Batasuna offices.</p>
<p>Some fear the political isolation of Herri Batasuna and violence against ETA allies will bring on retaliation.</p>
<p>"This will have consequences," one Mondragon resident said. "In the long term, Herri Batasuna will exact its revenge."</p>
