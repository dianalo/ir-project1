<headline>MALAYSIA STOCKS - factors to watch - August 4.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-08-04</dateline>

<p>Following are some of the main factors likely to affect Malaysian stocks on Monday:</p>
<p>* Imposition of curbs on foreign exchange swaps by central bank, Bank Negara, lifting ringgit in early trade and seen buoying sentiment in Kuala Lumpur shares. Auto stocks may benefit from lower cost of imported components.</p>
<p>* But market analysts say lift from ringgit may be offset by concerns the Bank Negara policy is regressive, poor Telekom results and lingering rumours of big June trade gap.</p>
<p>* On Friday, Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index ended down 10.21 points or 1.01 percent at 1,002.63.  </p>
<p>* At 0847 GMT, ringgit quoted at 2.5950/00, recouping from low of 2.6290. On Friday, Bank Negara asked commercial banks to hold their base lending rates steady despite recent spike in interbank rates, sources said.</p>
<p>* "I think in terms of monetary policy, it (the swap curbs) sets us back, but in terms of stock market security...the market might react positively initially," said Ralph Dixon, of TA Securities' international division.</p>
<p>* Said Phua Lee Kerk, head of research at Jupiter Securities, "Under normal situations, this should be positive, but on Friday, Telekom's results were quite a disappointment."</p>
<p>* Telekom's half-year net profit was 889.9 million ringgit, well below market forecasts. The stock is the second largest capitalised stock on the market and can sway the market by its movement.</p>
<p>* "I think it (Telekom) will exert some downward pressure on the CI," Phua said.</p>
<p>* Talk is also circulating that Malaysia may report a June trade gap of as much as 1.5 billion ringgit, dealers said.</p>
