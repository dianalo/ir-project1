<p>Novelist Jose Donoso, who wrote black comedies of bourgeois Chilean life, was buried on Sunday on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean while the Spanish-speaking world's top writers extolled his legacy.</p>
<p>Donoso died on Saturday, aged 71, after a long bout of liver disease.</p>
<p>"With his death, we have lost the man who was perhaps South America's greatest novelist," said Cuban writer Guillermo Cabrera Infante, quoted in the Santiago newspaper La Epoca.</p>
<p>"He presented the complex reality of being an Ibero-American with an insight and penetration that few others could match," said Venezuela's Arturo Uslar Pietri.</p>
<p>Donoso, whose works included "El obsceno pajaro de la noche" (The Obscene Bird of the Night) and "El lugar sin limites" (Hell Without Limits), was buried next to his parents in the seaside village of Zapallar, with a eulogy from Chilean Education Minister Jose Pablo Arellano.</p>
<p>Donoso often spent summer holidays in Zapallar, 90 miles (150 km) north of Santiago, and asked to be buried in the town cemetery, family members said.</p>
<p>Donoso's works, which mixed humour with dark surrealism, often centred on bourgeois Chileans clinging to social graces while living in worlds of violence, disintegrating values and sexual ambiguities.</p>
<p>His dense, difficult prose prevented his books from reaching the mass audience of those by Peru's Mario Vargas Llosa and Colombia's Gabriel Garcia Marquez, who, like Donoso, were part of Latin America's literary boom of the 1960s.</p>
<p>But critics loved him and compared his best works to Marcel Proust and Henry James. His last novel, "Donde van a morir los elefantes" (Where Elephants Go To Die), was a bestseller in Chile, a critical success and widely translated.</p>
<p>Latin American literary figures eulogised Donoso for his prolific output -- he wrote about 20 books including novels, memoirs and short stories -- and his refusal to bow to popular tastes.</p>
<p>"Of all the writers I have met, Pepe Donoso was probably the most literary, because I don't think anyone else made literature a way of life as he did," said Vargas Llosa, using Donoso's nickname.</p>
<p>Donoso is survived by his wife Pilar Serrano and daughter Pilar. He left a last novel, El Mocho, about coal miners in southern Chile, which the family will publish posthumously.</p>
