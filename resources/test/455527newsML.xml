<p>One of Lithuania's leading dairy companies, Rokishkis Cheese, had a 3.5 million litas net profit in the first two months of this year versus 600,000 litas in the same period in 1996, newspaper Lietuvos rytas reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The profit has increased because the company does not have to pay profit taxes this year," the head of the company Antanas Trumpa told the newspaper.</p>
<p>The newspaper said the company was exempt from profit tax because it has eight million litas in foreign investments. Its total share capital is 30 million litas.</p>
<p>Investment bank Williams de Broe is one of the company's foreign owners, having bought a stake earlier this year.</p>
<p>The newspaper also said that Trumpa was sure that the profit of the company during the first quarter of 1997 will be at least five million litas and the profit for the entire year will be around 20 million litas.</p>
<p>The company's net profit in 1996 rose to 12.2 million litas from 9.3 million litas the previous year.</p>
<p>Rokishkis is one of the leading blue chip stocks on the Vilnius bourse.</p>
