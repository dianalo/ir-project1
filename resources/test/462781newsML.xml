<headline>RESEARCH ALERT - Edelbrock estimates lowered.</headline>
<text>
<p>-- Mesirow Financial Inc said Monday it lowered its earnings estimate for Edelbrock Corp for fiscal 1997 to $1.40 a share from $1.42 and the estimate for the third quarter to $0.31 from $0.32. It also set an estimate for fiscal 1998 of $1.83 a share.</p>
<p>-- The estimate reductions were made to reflect the effects of adverse weather on sales and the delay in producing a new shock absorber line, Mesirow said. The new estimates are a fine-tuning rather than a reflection of fundamental changes at the company, Mesirow said.</p>
<p>-- Production of the new shock absorber line is not expected to begin until early- to mid-April, Mesirow said.</p>
<p>-- Edelbrock makes automotive aftermarket parts.</p>
<p>-- Its shares were up 3/8 Monday at 19-1/4.</p>
