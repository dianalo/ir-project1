<p>A sharp decline in the sale of basketballs and baseball-related items prompted Rawlings Sporting Goods Co. on Wednesday to predict a loss for its first quarter, but the company expects orders to rebound in time to pump up quarterly revenues by mid-1997.</p>
<p>Rawlings reported that first-quarter revenues and net income will be below year-ago levels and the dip in revenues will result in a loss in the first fiscal quarter, which ends Nov. 30.</p>
<p>The St. Louis-based sporting goods manufacturer posted revenues of $35.5 million in the first quarter a year ago and net income of $890,000.</p>
<p>The report sent Rawlings stock down $2.125 to close at $8.25 on Nasdaq.</p>
<p>Rawlings officials cited weakness in sales of commemorative baseballs, baseball gloves and basketballs as having the greatest impact on the first-quarter revenue slump, although the outlook beyond November is somewhat brighter.</p>
<p>"Our other commemorative merchandise was down, even excluding the Cal Ripken baseball sales," company Chief Financial Officer Paul Martin said in an interview. "We thought the Ripken volume would be replaced, but that hasn't happened. We're currently studying other types of commemorative baseballs to offer for the 1997 season."</p>
<p>Sales of a baseball marking Ripken's breaking the all-time consecutive-game record significantly contributed to the bottom line last year, Rawlings said.</p>
<p>Industry analysts believe that a shift in ordering patterns by the company's larger customers also affected first-quarter results.</p>
<p>"Unlike in previous years, customers are ordering goods on an as-needed or just-in-time basis," said Wesley Roberts, an analyst at Hilliard Lyons. "The first quarter used to be a solid sales period for Rawlings because they shipped goods for the spring in November."</p>
<p>Roberts added that Rawlings could rebound in the second or third quarters as demand by retailers improves.</p>
<p>Rawlings officials agreed with that projection, based on recent discussions with its retail customers.</p>
<p>"Retailers are saying they're generally optimistic about the 1997 spring selling season," Martin said, "including one large retailer who feels that Olympic merchandise will be replaced by baseball goods."</p>
<p>Adding to the current slump is a market reaction to NCAA-related promotions last spring by Pizza Hut and Wal-Mart that involved passing out thousands of rubber basketballs.</p>
<p>"There's a general softness in the retail basketball business," explained Martin. "There's a glut of rubber basketballs and that has had an aggregate affect on the whole category."</p>
<p>Tim Conder, an analyst at A.G. Edwards, feels that Wall Street could soon embrace Rawlings again as customers resume placing large orders.</p>
<p>"We believe the stock has pretty much bottomed out, given that Rawlings customers expect spring to pick up," Conder said.</p>
