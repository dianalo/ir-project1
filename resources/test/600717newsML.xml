<p>Shares in Honda Motor Co Ltd fell on Wednesday morning, as the yen's strength against the dollar invited profit-taking despite the automaker's record earnings, released on Tuesday, traders said.</p>
<p>At 0057 GMT, the share price was down 60 yen at 3,570, with 1.036 million shares traded.  </p>
<p>On Tuesday, Honda said that its profits more than tripled in the last business year to March 31, 1997, as the weaker yen galvanised overseas sales.</p>
<p>Honda's group net profit for the year rose 212.4 percent year-on-year to a record 221.17 billion yen. Its group sales also rose 24.5 percent to a record level.</p>
