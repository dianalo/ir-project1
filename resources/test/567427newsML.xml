<headline>Cohen to seek cuts in fighter programs - officials.</headline>

<p>Defence Secretary William Cohen has decided to reduce by more than 300 the planned purchase of F-22 and FA-18E/F fighter jets in programmes under development by Lockheed Martin Corp. and McDonnell Douglas Corp., defence officials said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But the cuts, which would be proposed to Congress this month under the Pentagon's cost-cutting quadrennial defence review, would not cancel Lockheed's F-22 "stealth" jet for the Air Force or McDonnell's FA-18E/F attack jet for the Navy.</p>
<p>Defence officials, who asked not to be identified, confirmed a Washington Post report that Cohen planned to recommend that the Air Force's previously planned purchase of 438 F-22s be reduced to 339. The cost of that programme under the full buy had been estimated at about $67 billion.</p>
<p>The QDR will recommend that Navy buys of the advanced FA- 18E/F be cut to about 785 or perhaps fewer from 1,000, the officials said. The Navy has planned to buy 1,000 of the aircraft for about $80 bilion by the year 2015.</p>
<p>Officials said there was no immediate indication that Cohen planned to seek cuts in the so-called Joint Strike Fighter programme which Lockheed Martin and Boeing Co. are competing to build.</p>
<p>The winning firm is expected to eventually build as many as 3,000 of the fighters for more than $170 billion in the next century. Variations of the jet would go to the Air Force, Navy, Marines and British Royal Navy and could be sold to other countries.</p>
