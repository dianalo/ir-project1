<p>European Union leaders, keen to boost jobs and competitiveness, welcomed on Tuesday a European Commission plan to move towards completing the bloc's single market to coincide with the launch of monetary union.</p>
<p>Draft conclusions from the Dutch EU presidency said the heads of state and government endorsed the overall objective of the plan, which seeks to remove remaining barriers in the world's largest internal market by January 1, 1999.</p>
<p>"The European Council reaffirms the importance it attaches to a well functioning internal market as an essential element of the overall strategy to promote competitiveness, economic growth and employment throughout the Union," the draft said.</p>
<p>The strategic targets in the action plan "should form the basis for a renewed political effort to remove remaining obstacles so as to ensure that the full potential benefit of the single market is realised," it added.</p>
<p>The draft also called on the EU Council of Ministers and the European Parliament to reach early agreement on a limited number of priority measures in the single market action plan.</p>
<p>"It further invites the Council to take the necessary steps...to reach the widest possible agreement by early 1999 on the other key areas of the internal market," it said.</p>
<p>The original single market programme was launched in 1985 to create a huge domestic market to help European firms compete on global markets by removing all barriers to the movement of goods, services, capital and people.</p>
<p>According to a Commission survey, it has resulted in 900,000 more jobs, boosted EU income and lowered inflation.</p>
<p>However, there are still a number of obstacles to a truly border-free market, not least because only 65 percent of single market legislation is fully in force in all 15 member states.</p>
<p>Also, some of the most controversial and complicated issues -- such as greater tax harmonisation and the abolition of border controls on people -- were left unresolved in the 1985 plan.</p>
<p>The Commission wants to implement its action plan in three phases, given that some of the proposed measures, especially those on tax coordination, may be difficult for member states to agree by 1999.</p>
<p>Reflecting this, the draft conclusions said EU leaders stressed "the necessity of differentiating in time between various categories of action in the action plan."</p>
<p>"In the first instance, the Community institutions and the member states should focus their attention on areas where actions can be undertaken immediately or where negotiations can be completed quickly on existing proposals," it said.</p>
<p>Avoiding a barrage of new legislation, the Commission's plan focuses on the need to apply and enforce existing Single Market rules, like those affecting government contracts which account for 11.5 percent of the EU's Gross Domestic Product.</p>
<p>The EU leaders appeared to agree with this, saying actions should be taken immediately to make existing single market rules more effective and calling on the Commission to examine ways of enforcing implementation on the ground.</p>
