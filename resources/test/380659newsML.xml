<p>FIER, Albania, Feb 15 (REUTER) - The daily anti-government protests are disorganised and brief but they provide a welcome distraction in this southern Albanian town where work is scarce and grinding poverty a fact of life.</p>
<p>When  demonstrators spot  the journalists, the march begins.</p>
<p>"When will you start the demonstrations? Only you can inspire us," a young man driving by in a bicycle shouts at one camera team.</p>
<p>Women and children are cheering the protesters, mostly men, from from the balconies of their dilapidated apartment blocks.</p>
<p>"No more dictatorship -- it's enough. They have stolen the money that we needed to rear our children," says 38-year-old Liljana, a toddler on her arms.</p>
<p>Police stepped aside on Saturday to let 1,000 protesters stage a fourth day of noisy but peaceful marches against the right-wing government's handling of collapsed pyramid schemes.</p>
<p>Three days ago, six protesters were injured in an attack by a group of civilians armed with clubs and iron bars. On Friday, riot police scuffled with a crowd of some 5,000 protesters but on Saturady police gave up.</p>
<p>About 80 riot policemen were at a nearby compound but kept a low profile.</p>
<p>People simply don't trust  them.</p>
<p>"Stay with us, as soon as you leave they will start beating us up," one elderly woman pleads with foreign camera crews covering the demonstrations.</p>

<p>Destitute investors blame the government of President Sali Berisha for letting the high-risk schemes flourish for years and standing by idly when they started to crumble.</p>
<p>Older children joyously join the processions, running back and forth in the crowd and waving happily at the cameras.</p>
<p>Few of them attend school on a regular basis, spending their days loitering in the dusty streets, begging for money or selling vegetables at small stands.</p>
<p>Six years after the fall of communism, the people of Albania have yet to see the benefits of the free market which they were promised by Berisha when he came to power in 1992.</p>
<p>The economy of Fier, once the region's industrial centre, is on its knees.</p>
<p>A Chinese-built chemical plant, once the town's biggest employer, has long been shut. A lone coal-fired power plant in a suburb spews out yellowish smoke, the only sign of industrial activity for miles around.</p>
<p>Locals say more than 80 percent of the population have no regular work, with much of the rest making a living by working in one of the numerous cafes and bars that have sprung up along the town's pot-holed streets.</p>
<p>Fier once was a stronghold of Berisha's ruling Democrats. But residents now have little sympathy left for the government, which they blame for their plight.</p>
<p>Even some riot police privately admit that they have no intention of hitting the angry and desperate townspeople.</p>
<p>"You won't find a man among us who hasn't been ruined by these pyramid schemes," says a policemen who asks not to be named. "We have been cheated ourselves -- that's why we are letting them protest."</p>
