<p>Barclays Plc said on Thursday its investment banking arm BZW had made an operating profit of 124 million stg for the first half of the year, but also revealed a 20 million stg loss in equity derivatives.</p>
<p>The UK bank said the loss resulted from uncertainties in the UK market ahead of the UK election in May and "by the anticipation of potential changes in the budget".</p>
<p>It said there had also been a further smaller loss following the July UK budget.  </p>
<p>Following the Labour government's first budget there had been widespread speculation that BZW and a handful of other banks had been hit by significant losses as a result of changes to the tax regime.</p>
<p>Barclays said BZW's operating profit "recovered substantially from the second half of 1996 although, because of the continued planned investment in people and technology in 1997, it is below the result achieved in the first half of the year".</p>
<p>Operating profit in the first half of 1996 was 148 million stg and 42 million stg in the second half.</p>
<p>BZW's total income of 692 million stg for the first six months of the year represented growth of 13 percent over the previous six months and six percent over the first half of 1996.</p>
<p>This was "largely the result of an improved performance by the markets business and the realisation of investments within Private Equity".  </p>
<p>BZW's fees and commissions of 220 million stg were in line with the second half of 1996 but "did not reach the high levels (275 million stg) of the first half of last year when primary equity market conditions in the UK were particularly favourable".</p>
<p>Barclays said BZW had secured a significant potential flow of business for the second half of 1997 and beyond, with international business particularly active, especially cross-border mergers and acquisitions and primary equity issuance in Asia.  </p>
<p>BZW's secondary equity commissions were strong and above 1996 levels, while dealing profits rose to 228 million stg, from 169 million in the second half of 1996 and 221 million in the first half.</p>
<p>"This reflects a strong performance in foreign exchange, due largely to the refocusing of the business, together with good results from the sterling fixed income and money markets business and favourable trading conditions in base metals in the early part of the year," Barclays said.</p>
<p>It said BZW's recently established Japanese government bond business had made good progress and there had been notable success in expanding the sterling franchise to foreign issuers.</p>
<p>BZW's costs over the period were 561 million stg. These were similar to the second half of 1996 and reflected the "continued commitment to a programme of upgrading people and systems".  </p>
<p>Barclays said replacing older IT systems at BZW was a strategic priority and the bank was committed to its programme of investing in and upgrading staff in key areas.</p>
<p>Along with the costs of completing the move to Canary Wharf in London's Docklands area, this was expected to result in "a small overall increase in costs in the second half of the year".</p>
