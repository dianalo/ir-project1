<p>India on Tuesday outlined the stepping stones the country needed to cross to float the rupee as a fully convertibile currency by the year 2000.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P.Chidambaram put capital account convertibility firmly on the economic agenda last February, in a budget which gave fresh momentum to India's reform programme.</p>
<p>Chidamabaram ordered the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to chart the path toward full convertibility, which will be a key landmark in the country's liberalisation process begun in 1991.</p>
<p>The rupee is currently convertible on the current account.</p>
<p>A committee appointed by the RBI recommended targets for inflation and the country's fiscal deficit, deregulation of the interest rate structure and freedom for Indians to invest abroad as prerequisites for convertibility.</p>
<p>The committee, headed by former RBI deputy governor S.S. Tarapore, recommended a phased implementation of capital account convertibility over a three year period, and said the authorities should remain flexible in their approach.</p>
<p>"The preconditions are a process," Tarapore told Reuters after presenting the report to RBI governor Chakravarty Rangarajan.</p>
<p>"Capital account convertibility is a process. It does not end after three years, it goes on," he said.</p>
<p>The RBI said in a statement it would gear policy toward achieving the preconditions laid down, but would retain room for manouevre.</p>
<p>"The committee viewed the preconditions or signposts and the attendant variables as processes rather than one-time indicators," the RBI said.</p>
<p>"Depending on the assessment regarding the attainment of these milestones, the timing and sequencing of the measures of capital account convertibility could be accelerated or decelerated," the central bank said.</p>
<p>The major preconditions are reduction in fiscal deficit to 4.0 percent of GDP in 1998/99 from the budgeted 4.5 percent in 1997/98 and a further reduction to 3.5 percent in 1999/2000.</p>
<p>"The mandated rate of inflation for the three-year period should be an average of three to five percent," RBI said.</p>
<p>It said the parliament should empower the RBI on the inflation rate and only the parliament should alter the mandate.</p>
<p>"Once a mandate is given, the RBI should be given freedom to attain the target... Such a mandate would necessarily need to provide for greater independence for the RBI."</p>
<p>RBI said interest rate should be fully deregulated in 1997/98. The average cash reserve ratio should be reduced to 8.0 percent in 1997/98 (from 9.3 percent), 6.0 percent in 1998/99 and 3.0 percent in 1999/2000, the panel recommended.</p>
<p>"In the conduct of exchange rate policy, the RBI should have a monitoring band of plus or minus five percent around the neutral real effective exchange rate (REER) and ordinarily intervene as and when the REER is outside this band," it said.</p>
<p>The REER should be declared and changes made public.</p>
<p>Policy should be set to reduce India's debt service ratio from 25 to 20 percent of GDP, the committee said.</p>
<p>To prevent an ubridled increase in domestic money supply without adequate backing of foreign exchange reserves, a minimum net foreign assets to currency ratio of 40 percent should be stipulated in the RBI Act, the committee said.</p>
