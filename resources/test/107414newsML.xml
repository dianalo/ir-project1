<title>USA: Zurn Industries to sell power systems units.</title>

<p>Zurn Industries Inc said Thursday it plans to sell its power systems construction and equipment supply units in an effort to improve the company's overall earnings.</p>
<p>The company said it did not expect its decision to significantly affect its financial position.  The overall impact of the decision is to be included in its results for the second quarter ended September 30.</p>
<p>The company said it is still being determined how the decision will be accounted for in that period, whose results are to be released October 18.  </p>
<p>The businesses to be sold include National Energy Production Corp of Redmond, Wash., which designs, builds and operates small- to medium-sized power plants; Zurn Energy Division of Erie, Pa., which produces steam generating systems and equipment; and Zurn Air Systems Division of Birmingham, Ala., which manufactures fans and equipment to control emissions.</p>
<p>Those units had fiscal 1996 revenues of $137 million.</p>
<p>The company said it decided to sell the units because it has determined that its competitiveness in the international market is constrained by its available financial capacity.  </p>
<p>The company said international construction projects usually require letters of credit to cover possible liquidated damages, as well as other financial guarantees.</p>
<p>"Given the magnitude of these guarantees, Zurn's financial capacity would be seriously restricted regarding potential investments in our water control and other business," Zurn Chairman and Chief Executive Robert Womack said in a statement.</p>
<p>Zurn Industries manufactures and markets plumbing products and provides water resource construction services and fire protection systems.</p>
