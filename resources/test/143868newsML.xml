<p>The European Union, anxious for a profile in the Middle East peace process, is expected to move closer to naming a special envoy to the region when the General Affairs Council meets in Luxembourg on Monday.</p>
<p>EU officials said on Friday there was still some debate over whether the proposed envoy should be a diplomat or a politician, but once this was agreed an appointment would be swift.</p>
<p>Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring -- representing the EU's current presidency -- said earlier this week that the planned envoy would not be directly involved in peace negotiations but would rather pull together the EU's disparate interests in the region.</p>
<p>Spring said Israeli leaders did not react negatively to the idea of an EU envoy when he visited the Middle East shortly after the Dublin summit.</p>
<p>The EU is the Middle East's main trading partner and the biggest aid donor to the Palestinians.</p>
<p>"A great deal of the prospects for the Middle East peace process depend on the economic regeneration of the Palestinian Authority," Spring said. "I don't see that happening without the active involvement of the EU."</p>
<p>The Commission has been closely involved in diplomatic efforts by the 15-nation bloc for a Middle East role more in keeping with what it considers to be its significant financial contribution.</p>
<p>The last thing the EU wants is to appoint an envoy who would not be entertained by Israel, and that is a real fear given the reception accorded French President Jacques Chirac on Monday. Chirac's weekend offer for France or Europe to mediate in the stalled peace process was brushed aside by Israeli officials.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette will brief his colleagues on the visit by Chirac.</p>
<p>The EU has been the most prominent bankroller of development efforts in Palestinian-controlled areas of Gaza and the West Bank and, more significantly, is also discussing lucrative trade ties with Israel under the umbrella of its Mediterranean policy.</p>
<p>EU officials are reluctant to use the threat of cancelling Israel's participation as a lever into the peace process, but diplomats said one of the envoy's tasks "would be to remind all the parties of our considerable assistance".</p>
<p>The presence of Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa in Luxembourg will not help assuage Israeli feelings that the EU is biased towards the Palestinians in its Middle East policy.</p>
<p>Moussa will be in Luxembourg for a so-called "cooperation council" a regular meeting during which EU foreign ministers review relations with trading partners. Israel and the Middle East peace process will figure large in that review, diplomats said.</p>
<p>Diplomats will also review progress of the Mediterranean plan as part of a regulaar review.</p>
