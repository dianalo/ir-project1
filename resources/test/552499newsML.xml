<p>The Philippine peso rose to 26.368 to the dollar from 26.37 in intraday trade on Wednesday after the Central Bank raised its overnight borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage points to 11 percent, dealers said.</p>
<p>The peso was also bolstered after the Central Bank lowered its offer rate for the dollar back to 26.37 from 26.375.  </p>
<p>"I believe the Central Bank just burned banks speculating on the rate," a big bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Traders said those banks previously buying dollars are now selling.</p>
<p>Banks had been edgy because the slump in the stock market would mean an outflow of dollars by foreign fund investors.</p>
<p>Central Bank officials, however, said the funds shifted their money to short-term, fixed income debt from the equities market.</p>
<p>The increase in the Central Bank's overnight borrowing rate made it more expensive for banks to hold on to dollars.</p>
<p>Before the rate hike, the Central Bank was seen selling over $100 million at 26.37/26.375, traders said. The Central Bank did not confirm its intervention.</p>
<p>Volume on the computerised dealing system of the peso/U.S. dollar reached $291 million.</p>
