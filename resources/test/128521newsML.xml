<p>Britain's newest political party held its first conference on Saturday in a fanfare of optimism and publicity over its bid to secure a referendum on Britain's future place in Europe.</p>
<p>Several thousand people packed into a conference centre to cheer an array of celebrity speakers, disaffected Conservatives and several members of the European parliament putting forward the case for a full-scale referendum on European integration.</p>
<p>The turnout belied attempts by Britain's established parties to dismiss the impact of the Referendum Party, founded by billionaire Sir James Goldsmith less than a year ago.</p>
<p>Opening the one-day conference, former Conservative Party treasurer Lord McAlpine, warned political foes not to dismiss the fledgling party as "little Englanders".</p>
<p>McAlpine said the referendum the party was seeking "will be about the most important decision the British people have faced within 100 years of history."</p>
<p>The Referendum Party plans to field about 600 candidates in general elections which must be held by May 1997. Goldsmith has said it does not seek power and will disband once it has achieved its goal.</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major, whose party is more than 20 points behind opposition Labour in opinion polls, has dismissed the Referendum Party as a "fringe organisation."</p>
<p>But political analysts say that even a small number of votes for the Referendum Party could lead to defeat for some Conservative candidates in closely-fought seats.</p>
<p>Goldsmith claims increasing support from traditional Conservative voters fearful of European federalism and the influence of Brussels in British life.</p>
<p>The party has yet to spell out precisely what question it would like its proposed referendum to put to the British people. But it has made clear that the issue goes far beyond whether Britain should join a single European currency.</p>
<p>McAlpine derided Major's opt-out policy on the single currency as "a policy of futility".</p>
<p>"The prime minister's option is, as are so many of his opt-outs and open options, not in reality an option at all," he said.</p>
<p>"Our first job is to wake the country from its slumber of indifference and then to lead the country from this Alice in Wonderland world of wait-and-see," McAlpine said.</p>
<p>The mood in the southern seaside resort conference centre was buoyant as actor Edward Fox, star of the thriller "Day of the Jackal" spelled out the role of referendums in British tradition.</p>
<p>Fox said last week he believed Goldsmith could be the Winston Churchill of the hour and he warned of appeasement towards Europe.</p>
