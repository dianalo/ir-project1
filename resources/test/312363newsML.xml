<p>Finance Minister Antonio Sousa Franco said he was not concerned at the strength of the escudo against the German mark, adding that he was sure the Bank of Portugal would act in the best interests of the Portuguese economy.</p>
<p>Germany is Portugal's single most important trade partner.</p>
<p>"There are no reasons to be worried at the appreciation of the escudo. The Bank of Portugal will certainly act in such a way to ensure the best interests of the Portuguese economy," he said.</p>
<p>But Sousa Franco declined to comment on whether or not the Bank would cut interest rates on Friday at the start of a new commercial bank reserve period.</p>
<p>"I don't want to give advice to the Bank of Portugal," he said.</p>
