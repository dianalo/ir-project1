<p>Catherine Megret, the far-right National Front mayor of Vitrolles, southern France, went on trial on Monday accused of advocating racial inequality in a newspaper interview.</p>
<p>Three anti-racism associations and more than 700 private citizens have pressed charges against Megret for inciting racial discrimination and defamation in the interview with the German daily Berliner Zeitung, in which she called immigrants "colonialists".</p>
<p>Friends and foes of the National Front demonstrated outside the heavily-guarded the Aix-en-Provence law courts as Megret arrived, accompanied by her husband Bruno Megret, the anti-immigrant party's number two, and the National Front mayor of Toulon, Jean-Marie le Chevallier.</p>
<p>Bruno Megret told reporters the trial was a witch hunt and an infringement of freedom of speech.</p>
<p>Catherine Megret captured a fourth French town for the Front in a municipal by-election last February after her husband was disqualified from running because he exceeded the legal ceiling on campaign expenses.</p>
<p>The trial coincided with soul-searching in the mainstream French right, defeated by the left in June 1 parliamentary elections, about relations with the National Front.</p>
<p>The Front, which advocates sending immigrants home, has been held at arm's length by mainstream parties, but the right has begun wondering aloud how to re-capture the Front's 15 percent share of voters.</p>
<p>French media on Monday played up confirmation by Front leader Jean-Marie Le Pen and right-wing Gaullist Robert Pandraud they they dined together at a Paris restaurant last week.</p>
<p>Pandraud, a former cabinet minister, said that neither the Front nor President Jacques Chirac's Gaullist RPR parties wanted to strike an alliance at the moment, but he favoured a dialogue.</p>
<p>Asked if the RPR should start talks with the Front, the RPR Secretary General Jean-Louis Debre told the conservative newspaper Le Figaro in an interview published on Monday:</p>
<p>"It is important for the movement's leaders to debate the issue in the coming months and agree on a clear position."</p>
<p>Debre, the former interior minister, said Gaullists would fight those who did not have the same ideas. But he appeared to be softer to the Front than to the left, saying: "Socialism is bad for France. The Front defends values which are not those of Gaullism."</p>
