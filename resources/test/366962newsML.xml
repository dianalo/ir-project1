<p>U.S. spot refinery products followed NYMEX futures higher Monday, with Gulf Coast distillates stealing the show amid continued refiner buying that swelled differentials across the board, traders said.</p>
<p>USG heating oil was offered at between 0.50 cent and 0.25 cent below March futures late afternoon, about one cent firmer than diffs seen late Friday.</p>
<p>Traders said distillates were helped by the approach of the scheduling deadline for shipping front fourth-cycle heat and low sulfur diesel on the Colonial Pipeline.</p>
