<p>Russia's upper chamber of parliament, the Federation Council, on Friday backed a draft law on religious association and freedom of conscience condemned by human rights activists as discriminatory.</p>
<p>Deputies voted 112 to four to back the bill passed by the lower chamber, the State Duma, last month.</p>
<p>It now goes to President Boris Yeltsin who appears set to sign it into law after an official government representative backed it during the Council session.</p>
<p>The draft, which has been welcomed by the Russian Orthodox Church, says only confessions that have operated in Russia for at least 15 years can set up new religious organisations. It also imposes new curbs on religious activity by foreign groups.</p>
<p>Patriarch Alexiy, the head of the Russian Orthodox Church, has condemned Western missionary activity in Russia, comparing it to the eastward expansion of the NATO defence alliance.</p>
<p>He said last month the bill would help halt the division of Russians along religious lines.</p>
<p>Critics say it contravenes Russia's constitution and revives Soviet-style limits on religion. They point out that 15 years ago religious groups were still tightly controlled by the officially atheist Communist state.</p>
<p>Some mainstream Christian denominations like Baptists and Seventh-Day Adventists have expressed concern that the hostility of the Orthodox Church, now a close ally of the Russian state, to foreign sects will also work against them.</p>
<p>But the Russian Orthodox Church and other traditional faiths including Islam have welcomed the bill, saying it will protect Russians against destructive cults such as Japan's doomsday sect Aum Shinri Kyo, which had many followers in Russia.</p>
<p>The Orthodox Church has been alarmed by the post-Soviet explosion of religious sects, which have fed on Russians' poverty, spiritual hunger or desire for the new and exotic.</p>
