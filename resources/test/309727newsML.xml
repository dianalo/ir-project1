<p>Israel summoned South Africa's ambassador on Wednesday to express deep concern over Pretoria's proposed arms deal with the Jewish state's arch-foe Syria.</p>
<p>The director-general of Israel's Foreign Ministry, Eytan Bentsur, told Ambassador Frank Land that South Africa's sale of $641 million of aim-enhancing gear for Soviet-made tanks could destabilise the Middle East.</p>
<p>"The director-general expressed faith that the South African government would understand the severity of the issue and its implications," the Foreign Ministry said in a statement. It said Bentsur expressed Israel's "deep concern".</p>
<p>"He emphasised the danger of selling sophisticated weaponry to a country such as Syria, which is included on the (American) list of states that support terorrism, and said it could lead to instability in the region."</p>
<p>The United States has threatened to cut off aid to South Africa -- worth $110 million this year -- if the deal goes ahead. Syria appears on the State Department's list of countries the United States says support terrorism.</p>
<p>South African President Nelson Mandela rejected the U.S. warning on Wednesday, vowing to disregard outside pressure.</p>
<p>"We will never allow any support or assistance from any country, no matter how powerful it is, to dictate our foreign policy, nor allow any country to violate our sovereignty and undermine our national pride," Mandela said.</p>
<p>He said it would be immoral to abandon countries that supported him in the anti-apartheid fight "on the advice of countries that were friends of the apartheid regime".</p>
<p>Israel and Syria have waged several wars and engaged in on-again, off-again peace talks over five years. The head of a leading Israeli strategic studies centre said on Tuesday a continued freeze in peace talks with Syria would raise significantly the chances of war between the two countries.</p>
