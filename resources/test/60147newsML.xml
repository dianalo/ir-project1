<p>Lou Guttman, a former chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, was ordered to pay a $500,000 penalty in connection with his alleged role in a scheme involving pre-arranged trades, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Monday.</p>
<p>The CFTC said an administrative law judge in the agency also banned Guttman from trading for five years, revoked his registration and ordered him to "cease and desist" from further violations of commodities laws.</p>
<p>Gary Glass, a former broker whose registration was revoked by the CFTC in  1991, was ordered to pay a $150,000 penalty and was banned permanently from trading, the CFTC said.</p>
<p>Barry Borer, a lawyer representing Guttman, said the CFTC decision "was subject to further review and we are confident that this decision will not stand."</p>
<p>Borer said his client intended to appeal this case to the full CFTC commission "and to the Supreme Court, if we have to." Glass could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Guttman and Glass were two of four respondents charged by the CFTC in an administrative proceeding in February 1993 of taking part in a scheme to pre-arrange trades on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange.</p>
<p>Guttman refused to step down from NYMEX after the charges were filed and was not renominated in the 1994 elections of exchange officers.</p>
<p>Harold Magid, one of the respondents, allegedly arranged nearly a dozen illegal trades in 1989, raising nearly $20 million. Magid, a former partner of Guttman, settled the case last year by paying a $25,000 fine, without admitting or denying guilt.</p>
<p>Gerald Inc., a Chicago-based futures broker, also settled last year by paying $65,000 in fines, without admitting or denying any wrongdoing.</p>
<p>In imposing the latest sanctions in the case, CFTC law judge George Painter found Guttman and Glass liable for a string of violations, the CFTC said.</p>
<p>The violations relate to sugar options transactions which were allegedly executed by Glass and Magid and the alleged scheme produced $19 million in "fictional equity" for accounts jointly owned by Guttman and Magid, the CFTD said.</p>
<p>Painter said Guttman should have maintained "the highest ethical standards," being chairman of NYMEX at the time of the alleged errant transactions and flayed Glass for his alleged "recidivism," according to the CFTC.</p>
<p>While noting that it was not possible to determine the actual gains Guttman made from the transactions, the violations and their frequency "are certainly grave," Painter said, according to the CFTC.</p>
<p>Guttman's lawyer said his client was held responsible for the conduct of his one-time partner, "only by a legal theory, the applicability of which is subject to doubt and has never before been applied to facts such as this."</p>
<p>"Mr. Guttman was singled out for this harsh and unprecendented treatment becaase of his highly visible, active and sometimes controversial role as chairman of the NYMEX," Borer said.</p>
