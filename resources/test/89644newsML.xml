<p>Metropolitan Bank and Trust Co (Metrobank) is expected to post a nine-month net profit of 3.308 billion pesos, 45 percent higher than the year-ago figure of 2.28 billion pesos, according to a Reuters poll of five Manila brokerages on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The bank is set to report its latest earnings this month. In the first half of this year, the bank posted a net profit of 2.034 billion pesos, 50 percent up from the year-ago 1.35 billion pesos.</p>
<p>Analysts say Metrobank has been well positioned to take advantage of the Philippine economy's robust growth because of its recent capital build-up and heavy branch expansion.</p>
<p>The bank raised 11 billion pesos since late 1993 through several rights offerings. It is now the country's largest capitalised bank with funds of 26.4 billion pesos as of June 1996.</p>
<p>"It was ahead in branching and capital build-up," said Conrad Andres, research head of DBP-Daiwa Securities.  </p>
<p>"It's benefitting from low-cost funds. They've been more aggressive in expansion since late 1993," said Saturnino Mejia of Guoco Securities.</p>
<p>Richard Tan, an analyst of Peregrine Secruities, said the bank also draws its strength from its close affiliation to the middle market Chinese-Filipino business community consisting of trading and manufacturing concerns.</p>
<p>"Having established itself in the Filipino-Chinese segment, it stands to gain the most. It is cushioned from the stiff competition for corporate accounts," he said.</p>
<p>Following are the forecasts made by brokerage houses:</p>
<p>				     (in billion pesos)</p>
<p> Asia Equity Securities	    3.2</p>
<p> Guoco Securities		    3.4</p>
<p> DBP-Daiwa Securities		3.2 to 3.3</p>
<p> Peregrine Securities		3.0 to 3.5</p>
<p> Urbancorp Securities		3.44</p>
