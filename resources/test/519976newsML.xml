<dateline>LONDON 1997-04-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>NWE oil products rose on stronger crude and futures on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Naphtha prices were steady, supported by firmer crude and gasoline futures. Gasoline edged slightly higher with crude and as NYMEX unleaded firmed around a cent a gallon.</p>
<p>Gas oil was firmer on the back of $1 a tonne stronger futures. Premiums were largely steady, except for easier Russians.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges gained as bunker demand picked up. Cargoes looked to support from material going east from the Med and low sulphur looked tight in the prompt period.</p>
