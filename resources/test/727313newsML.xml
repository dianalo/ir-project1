<p>Madrid shares ended higher on Monday, backed by currency strength and gains on foreign markets in mainly trading-based turnover, dealers said.</p>
<p>The general index added 4.93 points, 0.76 percent, to 628.10 and the Ibex index rose 56.90 points, 0.8 percent, to 7,169.42.</p>
<p>Clear resistance for the Ibex is pegged at 7,200, but the Dow's performance will call the tune, dealers said.</p>
<p>"It all depends on Wall Street...but as we enter the summer months we're seeing a lot of domestic demand with not a lot of foreign acitivity. We could hit 7,200, but to me it feels a bit thin up there," said one dealer at Societe Generale.</p>
<p>Repsol gained 200 ptas to 6,550 on a big put through and news of a Latam natgas deal after an overhanging sell order ended, dealers said. Gas Natural rose 100 ptas to 31,800.</p>
<p>Some negative feeling still prevails but the stock is due to gain now after lagging the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>Endesa up 260 pesetas to 12,760 amid some talk of strategic stake-building. Others ruled out core investor interest, adding that upside may be capped by the prospect of the autumn public share offering.</p>
