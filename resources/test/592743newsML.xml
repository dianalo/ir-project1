<p>Gauteng Lions,(formerly Transvaal, finished fifth in the Super 12 standings thanks to a rousing conclusion to their campaign at Ellis Park where they humbled semi finalists Natal 42-8 (half time 16-3).</p>
<p>The Lions put behind them a miserable antipodean campaign, which saw them gain just one point from four matches, with a five- try display of confident rugby.</p>
<p>Fullback Dawie du Toit scored twice, either side of half time after an initial kicking duel between Gavin Lawless and Edrich Lubbe had seen the latter lift his team to 9-3 in the 39th minute.</p>
<p>Du Toit's second try, five minutes into second half gave Gauteng a 20-point lead and they never looked back. Scrumhalf Jopie Adlam capped a livewire display with his team's third try nine minutes later, diving over from the base of a ruck.</p>
<p>Natal defended indifferently therefter and replacement wing Joe Gillingham sidestepped three tacklers to score in the 65th minute, while centre Jannie van der Walt finished a sweeping movement on the left three minutes later.</p>
<p>Natal left wing Cabous van der Westhuizen scored a consolation try in the dying minutes, put clear by a perfectly judged pass from replacement fullback Andre Joubert.</p>
<p>Springbok Joubert's first appearance of the season following a knee operation was the one crumb of comfort for the visitors, who now face the daunting task of taking on Auckland at Eden Park in the semi-final next week.</p>
<p>Auckland were comprehensive 39-17 victors in the log match at the same venue and with Natal looking a shadow of the side which began the tournament it will take a huge improvement for them to even be competitive next week.</p>
