<headline>OPINION - Ivan Wong comments on Malaysian palm oil.</headline>
<text>
<p>KUALA LUMPUR, March 14 - More data available indicated CPO production in February exceeded practically everybody's earlier expectations. This was especially so in Peninsular Malaysia. Our final estimate shows production fell 11.8 percent or 68,000 tonnes to 509,000 tonnes. This is an improvement on our previous estimate of 502,000 tonnes. Production in Peninsular Malaysia is estimated to have dropped nearly 8 percent to around 380,000 tonnes. The performance of major producers/millers ranged widely from up 10 pct to down 15 pct.  </p>
<p>In contrast, production in east Malaysia fell around 22 percent. The large decline was caused chiefly by excessive rains. Weather conditions has turned favourable throughout the country since the beginning of this month and a strong recovery in output is expected. Annual production growth in Feb-Mar also appears encouraging. Reflecting the upward revision in output, our estimate on end-Feb stocks of palm oil is raised to 675,000 tonnes from 670,000 estimated last week. Stocks of CPO alone are estimated to have dropped to 330,000 tonnes from 356,000 tonnes at end-January. The drawndown occured mostly in East Malaysia because of the larger production shortfall.  </p>
<p>Stocks of PK/PKO at end February are estimated at around 125,000 tonnes, oil basis, or about unchanged from month ago. PKO offtake is estimated to have shrunk to around 65,000 tonnes from 97,000 tonnes in January. Poor margins coupled with fewer working days had resulted in a marked cutback in exports of PO and PKO in February compared to January. However, improved supplies and a drop in the prices of CPO and PK/PKO in recent weeks have generated a pickup in export demand from this month onward. The USDA projection of tight supplies of SB in the summer months also augurs well for the prices outlook of PO and other edible oils in the next several months.  </p>
<p>This week May CPO futures fluctuated between 1,260 and 1,218 and settled at 1,244 ringgit yesterday compared to 1,234 ringgit a week ago and 1,276 at the start of the month. In the same period of last year, May futures fluctuated between 1,205 and 1,179 and were unable to settle above the 1,200 level. Although prevailing chart indicators looked negative, we expect CPO futures to be well supported at the 1,200 ringgit level in the coming weeks. Yesterday prices were thrice traded as low as 1,218 but managed to stage a strong rebound and finally settled at the high 1,244 ringgit despite a sharp fall in CBOT SBO futures.  </p>
<p>May/June RBD olein/RBD Palm oil were quoted at $570/$537.50 respectively.</p>
