<p>Taiwan's imports of gold bars, coins and plate fell 28.77 percent to 6.791 tonnes in November from 9.535 tonnes a year earlier, the Finance Ministry said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The imports were up from 6.064 tonnes in October.  </p>
<p>Gold traders attributed the fall in imports to a seasonal adjustment and a slower market following a period of tension with China in March.</p>
<p>Gold imports hit a record 25.238 tonnes in March, a time of high political and military tension between Taiwan and rival China, a 162.4 percent jump compared with March 1995.</p>
<p>Gold is traditionally considered a safe haven in times of uncertainty. Taiwanese began to buy gold heavily in mid-1995 when China conducted its first missile test near Taiwan to warn the island not to raise its international profile.</p>
<p>The gold stock accumulated since March would be slowly consumed by the end of 1996, gold traders said. Imports would return to normal in 1997, they added.</p>
<p>The ministry said Taiwan's gold exports in November remained modest at 0.366 tonnes, up from 0.304 tonnes in November 1995.</p>
