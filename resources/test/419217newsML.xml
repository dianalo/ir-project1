<p>--  LITTLEWOODS TO SELL 135 STORES</p>
<p>Littlewoods, the high street retailer and home shopping group, is reported to be considering placing its trademark stores up for sale. The sale of the 135-store chain which bears the company name could raise well over 500 million stg. The group, the U.K.'s largest private retailer, has appointed BZW to prepare a sale document, though Littlewoods has already received at least two serious approaches from potential bidders.</p>
<p>-- HIGH POUND COST JOBS SAYS BRITISH STEEL</p>
<p>Senior managers at British Steel have been instructed to give top priority to cost-cutting as the group fears that the strength of sterling will adversely affect trading. The group is also reported to be concerned that sterling will receive a further boost if Britain stays outside economic and monetary union (EMU). British Steel loses an estimated 100 million stg profit for every 10 pfenning rise in the pound versus the mark; since the start of 1996, the pound has risen 23 per cent against the mark.</p>
<p>-- NATWEST MOVE ON OPTION LOSSES SENDS SHARES DOWN</p>
<p>Shares in National Westminster Bank fell sharply on Monday, wiping 460 million stg from the bank's market value. The downward shift followed the news on Friday that NatWest was to set aside 50 million stg to cover losses run up by a junior trader. The trader, Kyriacos Papouis, has moved on to a U.S. investment bank, but NatWest is seeking an interview with him to establish whether he mispriced some trades in an attempt to cover up the losses.</p>
<p>-- CARD GROUPS SEE EURO OPPORTUNITIES</p>
<p>Card payment groups are anticipating an explosion of opportunities in Europe after European monetary union. The groups believe that plastic money could be the main beneficiary of EMU with cards being used more frequently because they will be more convenient during the transition. Visa, the world's largest card consortium, has set up a business centre to help its member banks with the adaptation.</p>
<p>-- TRACTOR MAKER FEARS EMU OPT-OUT</p>
<p>New Holland, the second-largest tractor manufacturer in the world, has warned that failure of sterling to join EMU could place in jeopardy future investment at the company's manufacturing site in Essex. The warning was issued on Monday by Umberto Quadrino, chief executive of New Holland, which is majority-owned by the Italian automotive giant Fiat. The Essex plant produces about 40 per cent of New Holland's tractor output, production which is worth some 1 billion sterling a year.</p>
<p>-- BT ORDERED TO HALT 'UNFAIR' OFFER</p>
<p>Britain's telecommunications industry regulator, Oftel, has ordered British Telecom to halt a 2.6 million stg marketing campaign. The instruction is the third in the past six months to be issued to BT by Oftel. On this occasion, the regulator said that BT had deliberately poached its rivals' customers and that the discounts offered by BT left its prices below the level of its costs.</p>
<p>-- STRONG POUND RESTRAINS MANUFACTURING</p>
<p>Figures compiled by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply (CIPS) show that the U.K. manufacturing industry remained on course for a steady but unspectacular recovery in February, restrained by a strong pound and a squeeze on prices. The purchasing managers' index showed output last month hit its highest level since November 1994, topping 57.7 in February compared to 55.8 in January. However, the index also revealed evidence of strong pressure on prices and the build-up of inventories.</p>
<p>-- AT&amp;T PREDICTS PROFITS TO FALL BY 30 PER CENT</p>
<p>U.S. telecoms giant AT&amp;T has predicted that its earnings will fall this year by up to 30 per cent, reflecting both the growing pressure from competition in the company's traditional markets and the investment costs facing AT&amp;T as it revamps its systems. The warning, which surprised Wall Street, was contained in the first full-scale presentation to investors and analysts by John Walter, AT&amp;T's new president. Walter also promised 'significant' changes in the culture at the company, and pledged savings of $2.6 billion over two years.</p>
<p>-- HSBC LOOKING INWARD AFTER 4.5 BILLION STG PROFIT</p>
<p>HSBC Holdings, the owner of the U.K.'s Midland Bank, is planning to invest solely in its own businesses in the coming year, rather than look for acquisitions. Group chief executive John Bond said that while HSBC was keen to expand in areas such as personal banking and insurance, it would be hard to justify acquisitions at current prices. The comments came as HSBC reported a 23 per cent rise in pre-tax profits, to 4.52 billion stg.</p>
<p>-- VANGUARD'S COSTS GROW AS TRIALS ACCELERATE</p>
<p>Biotechnology company Vanguard Medica has reported an increase in losses to 11 million stg in 1996 from 3.67 million stg, due largely to a sharp rise in development expenditure to 12.4 million stg. Shares in the group have risen strongly on the back of encouraging trials of its lead product, VML 251, a potential treatment for migraine. The product has now entered phase three clinical trials five months ahead of schedule.</p>
