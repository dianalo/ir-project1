<p>The Czech National Bank (CNB) on Tuesday said it may have to take "unpleasant and drastic" moves to stem inflationary pressures if it does not receive help from the government, unions and employers on curbing wage growth.</p>
<p>In an interview with the economic daily Hospodarske Noviny, CNB Vice-governor Pavel Kysilka said current instruments available to the central bank to combat inflation are insufficient, and there is a debate within the CNB over which measures to take.</p>
<p>"If the remaining pillars (measures) continue to miss, we will be forced to react more unpleasantly and drastically," he said. He did not elaborate.</p>
<p>Last summer the CNB introduced a series of tightening measures to reign in inflation and stem a burgeoning money supply.</p>
<p>The CNB raised its discount rate one full percentage point to 10.5 percent, and minimum reserve requirements on primary deposits to 11.5 percent from 8.5 percent.</p>
<p>Interbank money market rates up to three months in the Republic hover around 12.45 percent.</p>
<p>But Kysilka, who echoed a recent speech by CNB Governor Josef Tosovsky, said development in the growth of wages -- nominal industrial wages were up 21.1 percent, year-on-year in December -- must be tied to corresponding increases in labour productivity.</p>
<p>"Wage development is absolutely necessary to be controlled within the framework of labour productivity," he said.</p>
<p>Kysilka also said that the government needs change its budget policy so that a surplus is created. It passed a balanced budget for 1997 and ran a slim deficit of 1.6 billion crowns for 1996.</p>
