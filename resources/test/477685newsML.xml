<p>Ice cream maker Selecta Dairy Products Inc said on Monday it had targetted its market share to grow to 35 percent this year from the present 34 percent.</p>
<p>"We're looking at about 35 percent market share on a national basis," Selecta president John Concepcion told reporters after the company's stockholders meeting.</p>
<p>"That's a fairly conservative number. We're putting a lot of investments in terms of brand-building, (and) hopefully that will translate into bigger sales and higher market shares," Concepcion added.</p>
<p>The local ice cream market is still dominated by Magnolia Corp, a joint venture between food and beverage giant San Miguel Corp and Nestle Philippines Inc.</p>
<p>Selecta has been engaged in an aggressive marketing programme to wrest more market share from Magnolia.</p>
<p>It has earmarked 30 million pesos this year to expand its distribution network by 25 percent.</p>
<p>The company reported a 17 percent growth in net sales in 1996 to 1.35 billion pesos from the previous year. Income before tax jumped by 47 percent to 100 million from the previous year.</p>
<p>The company has projected that sales this year will reach 2.0 billion pesos, while income will total 233 million pesos before tax.</p>
<p>Concepcion attributed the income growth partly to a reduction in production costs. The company has closed down its Cebu plant and is concentrating all production in its plant in Rizal, just east of Manila.</p>
<p>Prices of raw materials have eased considerably as supplies of milk and sugar have gone from shortage to surplus situation by the end of last year, Concepcion added.</p>
<p>The company recently announced it will take on the milk and juice division of its parent firm, RFM Corp, as part of its diversification programme.</p>
<p>Concepcion said the new division is likely to contribute an additional 35 million pesos to its bottomline.</p>
<p>The company also said on Monday it had been appointed by Hershey Food Corp as the sole distributor of its confectionery products. Company officials declined to give any income projection from the distribution deal.</p>
