<p>The St. Louis Rams, who traded four picks to the New York Jets for the first overall selection, took Ohio State junior tackle Orlando Pace in the NFL Draft on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Seattle Seahawks made the biggest impact on Saturday, landing two of the top six picks in the draft and coming away with Ohio State junior cornerback Shawn Springs and Florida State junior tackle Walter Jones.</p>
<p>Six of the first seven picks in the draft were underclassmen. In all, 13 underclassmen were selected in the first round and nine of the first 18 picks were from Florida schools.</p>
<p>The 6-6 (1.98 meter), 330-pound 149.6 kg) Pace was the first player to win two consecutive Lombardi Awards as college football's outstanding lineman. He was the only sophomore to ever win the award. Pace in the last two seasons.</p>
<p>"My whole career has been a career of firsts," said Pace. "I was the first freshman to start at Ohio State and the first two-time Lombardi winner. I hope I can continue to do firsts in the NFL."</p>
<p>Pace will immediately help a Rams offensive line which allowed a league-high 57 sacks last year.</p>
<p>"I made up my mind this morning that Orlando was the guy," said Rams coach/president Dick Vermeil. "He's the guy to set the pace in St. Louis."</p>
<p>It was the first time an offensive lineman was the top overall pick in the draft since the Minnesota Vikings selected Southern California tackle Ron Yary in 1968.</p>
<p>Thursday's deal with the Jets enabled the Rams to jump over the Oakland Raiders, who traded up last month for the second overall pick and coveted Pace. Vermeil sent a first round pick (sixth overall), along with a third, fourth and seventh rounder to the Jets for the number one pick.</p>
<p>The Raiders, who last month made a deal with the New Orleans Saints to move up to the second spot, used the second pick on Southern California junior defensive tackle Darrell Russell.</p>
<p>"To be drafted second, I feel very fortunate," said Russell. "I'm very excited to be playing in Oakland."</p>
<p>The 6-4 (1.93 meters), 305-pound (138 kg) Russell joins a defensive line in Oakland which has Chester McGlockton and Russell Maryland at the tackles. Russell was an All-Pac-10 performer the last two seasons. He recorded 56 tackles, including 19 for losses last year.</p>
<p>The Seahawks, who made a trade last month with the Atlanta Falcons to move up to the third spot, selected Springs. The Seahawks lost starting cornerbacks Corey Harris and Carlton Gray to free agency and signed Willie Williams. With a glaring hole at left cornerback, Springs is a perfect fit for Seattle.</p>
<p>"He's the guy we wanted all along," said Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson of Springs. "This was a need position for us and when we moved up to the third spot last month, it was for Shawn Springs."</p>
<p>The Baltimore Ravens, who were fielding offers for the fourth overall pick, stayed put at number four and selected Florida State junior defensive end Peter Boulware. Boulware averaged 11 sacks per season over his three-year career, including a school-record 19 last year.</p>
<p>The first senior was finally selected when the Detroit Lions used the fifth overall pick on Texas cornerback Bryant Westbrook.</p>
<p>The first surprise of the draft was provided by the New York Giants, who selected Florida wide receiver Ike Hilliard with the seventh overall pick. Most scouts had rated Hilliard as the third-best receiver, behind Colorado's Rae Carruth and Yatil Green of Miami.</p>
<p>Hilliard had seven catches for 150 yards and three touchdowns in Florida's 52-20 rout of Florida State in the Sugar Bowl.</p>
<p>After two trades to stockpile picks, Jets coach and director of operations Bill Parcells finally made a pick, selecting Virginia linebacker James Farrior eighth overall.</p>
<p>"We're just trying to collect as many good players as possible," Parcells said.</p>
<p>The first pick of the Mike Ditka era in New Orleans was a surprise. The Saints selected Colorado guard Chris Naeole.</p>
<p>"A lot of people said you have to get a skill position player, and there are outstanding skill players in the draft, but in order to run the ball and throw the ball you need the players up front," said Ditka.</p>
<p>Six of the top seven picks were underclassmen. A total of 34 underclassman applied for the draft.</p>
