<headline>UK appeal court accepts Nadir aide sentence plea.</headline>

<text>
<p>The London Court of Appeal on Thursday said it had accepted an appeal by Elizabeth Forsyth, a former aide of Polly Peck head Asil Nadir, against a five-year sentence for handling stolen money.</p>
<p>"We have formed a view that this sentence cannot stand," Lord Justice Beldam said at the outset of the appeal hearing, adding that the sentence was so disproportionate that, "taking into account the time she has already served...she should not serve any longer."  </p>
<p>Justice Manse, then moved on to consider Forsyth's appeal against her conviction on two counts of dishonestly handling 400,000 pounds. Forsyth's lawyer, Geoffrey Robertson QC, said he would make an application for bail so that his client could be freed pending the outcome of her appeal against the conviction.</p>
<p>Forsyth has been in prison since March 1996 when Justice Sir Richard Tucker surprised those following the case with the severity of his sentence.</p>
<p>She was chairman of South Audley Management, a firm set up by Turkish Cypriot Nadir to deal with his wealthy family interests before his Polly Peck empire collapsed in 1990 under a mountain of debt.</p>
<p>Nadir still faces charges connected to Polly Peck but in 1993 he fled to northern Cyprus, a territory not recognised by the British government, skipping 3.5 million pounds bail.</p>
