<p>The Joint Economic Committee of the U.S. Congress on Thursday issued a report that said the simplest path to economic improvement was through tax cuts, and said it would not necessarily impede balancing the budget.</p>
<p>"The way to improve the economy is by returning more control of the economy to private citizens," the report by Reed Garfield, senior economist of the committee, said.</p>
<p>"The simplest way to accomplish this objective is a tax cut," the report said. "Low taxes coupled with reduced government spending and lower regulatory burden is the surest path to improve our long-term economic growth outlook."  </p>
<p>The Republican-dominated committee is an advisory panel that issues studies and recommendations to Congress but does not formulate legislation.</p>
<p>The report said tax cuts made in the Kennedy and Reagan administrations spurred growth.</p>
<p>"The 1960s and 1980s demonstrate the effectiveness of cutting taxes in improving economic incentives," the report said. "The Kennedy cuts demonstrate that balanced budgets and tax relief are not necessarily incompatible," it added.</p>
<p>Rep. Jim Saxton, committee chairman, said tax cuts were just one of several factors that could help the economy.  </p>
<p>"To say taxes are the only factor is not correct," Saxton, a Republican from New Jersey, said. "It (tax policy) is one of the three or four factors ... that does have an effect on economic growth," he said, adding that other factors included federal spending, monetary policy and regulatory policy.</p>
<p>Separately, Saxton said in an effort to encourage savings, he planned to introduce legislation soon on Individual Retirement Accounts.</p>
<p>"In a week or so I am going to introduce a bill to provide expanded IRA opportunities which in effect is a tax cut on savings," he said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>His proposal would increase over time the maximum deductible contribution allowed to as much as $5,000 from the current $2,000.</p>
<p>It would also expand the income level cap. In order to qualify for the deduction currently, the taxpayer must make $50,000 or less in adjusted gross income, and Saxton's proposal would expand that to about $100,000.</p>
<p>There would be no withdrawal penalty from the retirement accounts if the money were used for such items as education, buying a first home and medical benefits, Saxton said.</p>
<p>Other legislators including Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, a Delaware Republican, have introduced IRA bills. President Clinton's budget also included IRA proposals.</p>
