<p>Sri Lanka will be able to contain inflation to single digit in 1997 despite substantial foreign exchange inflows from privatisation of its state-owned companies, the Central Bank said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The government expects to raise around 23.5 billion rupees ($399 million) through public sector reforms in 1997, the bulk of which will come in the form of foreign funds, officials said.</p>
<p>The government said on Tuesday it was retiring 10 billion rupees worth of treasury bills with part of the proceeds from the sale of a 35 percent stake in state-owned Sri Lanka Telecom (SLT) to Japan's Nippon Telephone and Telegraphic Corp (NTT) for $225 million.</p>
<p>"We are retiring 10 billion rupees worth of treasury bills from the Central Bank's portfolio to make sure that it does not fuel inflation," Central Bank Governor Amarananda Jayawardena told Reuters.</p>
<p>The remainder of the proceeds will be held by the Treasury as a deposit in the Central Bank, he added.</p>
<p>"The purpose is to sterilise the impact of this large inflow from having an impact on the domestic market," Jayawardena said.</p>
<p>"The 1997 average should fall to a single digit."</p>
<p>Sri Lanka's average annual inflation was 13.9 percent in July, down from 14.7 in June and 15.9 in 1996.</p>
<p>"The Central Bank's inflation target can be achieved because foreign inflows will improve the balance of payments," said Dushyantha Wijayasinghe, research manager at Asia Securities.</p>
<p>"Since Sri Lanka's inflation is largely imported, a good balance of payments situation will ease downward pressure on the currency," he added.</p>
<p>Jayawardena also said the Central Bank was keen to see interest rate stability.</p>
<p>"The market is already very liquid. We do not want to see interest rates falling further, because we are comefortable with the current rate structure," he said.</p>
<p>Market liquidity improved after the Central Bank cut banks' reserve ratios by 300 basis points in the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>Brokerage Jardine Fleming HNB said in a report that increased fund inflows had led it to reduce its forecast interest rates for 1997.</p>
<p>"Owing to increased fund inflows and lower government borrowing, forecast for benchmark 12-month treasury bill yields is now at 13.07 percent, down from 13.77 percent," it said.</p>
<p>The annual average prime lending rate will also remain lower at 14.83 percent this year from 15.43 in 1996, the report said.</p>
<p>The Public Enterprise Reform Commission, which oversees privatisations, says it expects to raise 10 billion rupees from the sale of 27.5 million government debentures in the National Development Bank Ltd and plantation companies.</p>
<p>Road shows are on for the sale of NDB debentures, which is expected to be launched in the middle of August.</p>
<p>"The capital raising now makes the government's projections of a budget deficit of 7.3 percent of GDP (gross domestic product) in 1997 feasible," Jardine Fleming said.</p>
<p>Controlling inflation will also keep the rupee from depreciating strongly, forex dealers said.</p>
<p>"If inflation is kept under control, there is little or no chance for the exchange rate to go over 61.50 to the dollar by the end of the year," said a HongKong Bank dealer. ($1 = 58.9 Sri Lanka Rupees)</p>
