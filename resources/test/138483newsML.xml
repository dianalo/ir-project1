<p>The Indonesian rupiah was little changed against the dollar in sleepy late trading on Wednesday, with liquidity remaining ample, dealers said.</p>
<p>"It was a quiet day. Major speculation was only on the intervention band," one local bank dealer said.</p>
<p>He said the market did not move at all after the central bank kept its fixing unchanged late on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said sentiment remained firm on the rupiah, with no turnaround for the dollar seen in the near-term.</p>
<p>Spot rupiah was quoted at 2,324.0/24.3 at 0905 GMT against an opening of 2,324.20/25.20.  </p>
<p>Tomorrow and today rupiah closed at 2,323.75/24.10 and 2,324.15/24.35, respectively.</p>
<p>The local bank dealer said the dollar might then rebound when interest rate differentials between the two currencies were so narrow that holding the rupiah was no longer attractive.</p>
<p>Overnight money was last traded at around 8.5 percent in the afternoon, compared with an opening of 11.0 percent.</p>
<p>Overnight swap was at 0.30/0.35 and tom/next at 0.40/0.45.</p>
<p>Dealers said liquidity was expected to remain flush on Thursday because many operators had rolled-over excess money with overnight central bank papers (SBIs).  </p>
<p>Another local bank dealer said offers by the central bank of SBIs at eight percent helped lift interest rates after overnight money fell to a low of seven percent in the morning.</p>
<p>Longer-term swaps were still under light pressure, but the local bank dealer said further downside was limited.</p>
<p>"I think it has bottomed out for now," the dealer said.</p>
<p>One-month swap was at 16.75/17.5, two at 33.5/35.0, three at 50.75/52.50 and six at 98.25/99.25 points.</p>
<p>The central bank kept its intervention rate at 2,324/2,516 and the conversion rate at 2,324/2,372 on Wednesday.</p>
