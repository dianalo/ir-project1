<p>Irish analysts can't agree on where interest rates are going. Some believe a fall in rates before the end of the year is inevitable, while others say lower rates in Ireland's booming economy would be "economic suicide".</p>
<p>But all agree that Ireland's central bank is facing a dilemma -- it must choose between lower interest rates or a stronger Irish pound, and neither option is very appealing.</p>
<p>Analysts say the dilemma has arisen because of heavy buying of Irish bonds by foreign investors. Optimism that Ireland will qualify for EMU (Economic and Monetary Union) has prompted investors to pile into the bond market in the belief that yields will converge with Germany as EMU approaches.</p>
<p>The resulting money market liquidity helped push the currency higher against the mark in recent months, but analysts say the central bank does not want to see further firming of the punt and has been selling punts to keep exchange rates down.</p>
<p>"Spreads at the shorter end of the curve, never mind those further out, are so attractive that it is triggering a wall of money into Irish bonds," said Han de Jong, chief economist at Goodbody Stockbrokers.</p>
<p>"The authorities must choose between letting the currency go up or stopping it. In recent weeks they have chosen not to let the currency rise, but in doing so they are exerting downward pressure on domestic interest rates," he said.</p>
<p>Analysts say the central bank is running out of funds to support money market rates. Once they run out, rates could collapse.</p>
<p>NCB Stockbrokers economist Dermot O'Brien said a fall in money market rates this year seemed extremely likely.</p>
<p>"The central bank cannot both hold down the exchange rate and maintain current interest rate levels because demand for Irish pounds clearly exceeds supply at these levels," O'Brien said. "If the currency is not allowed to rise, interest rates must fall to bring demand and supply into balance."</p>
<p>There was a strong chance that the one-year money market rate could fall by close to 100 basis points before the end of the year, O'Brien said.</p>
<p>But others say allowing rates to fall would spell disaster.</p>
<p>"If the bank is seriously concerned about inflation...the last thing they can afford is a fall in interest rates," said Alan McQuaid, economist at Bloxham Stockbrokers. "There is no room for complacency on the inflation front."</p>
<p>Ireland's economy has the fastest growth rate in the European Union, and analysts believe it will receive a further stimulus from tax cuts in the 1997 budget. Inflation is low but some fear it could rear its head in the medium term.</p>
<p>"With a fiscal stimulus guaranteed, it would in our view be economic suicide if the bank also allowed a monetary stimulus," McQuaid said.</p>
<p>De Jong said he was convinced the central bank would try to prevent rates falling. "The domestic economic situation...does not warrant lower rates," he said. "The question is not whether the authorities would want to do something about it, but what they can do to stand in the way."</p>
<p>But if rates don't come down, the central bank faces the problem of an appreciating currency. De Jong said one solution would be for the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) to take money out of the market by issuing short-term government bonds. Otherwise, the central bank may have to stop capping the currency.</p>
<p>"The prospect of Irish money market rates falling to German levels under present economic conditions...is so bizarre that we find it more compelling to believe the authorities will have the courage to act quickly to prevent it happening," he said.</p>
