<p>Johnson Controls Inc said its full-year outlook was consistent with the company's plans to achieve a double-digit improvement in operating results, and it saw higher seating and interior systems sales.</p>
<p>"Compared with earlier in this fiscal year, we are somewhat more optimistic about certain of our operations and cautious about some others," James Keyes, Johnson Controls chairman, said.</p>
<p>"On the positive side, we believe that our seating and interior systems sales will be higher than our expectations several months ago, primarily due to the strength of the domestic automotive market."  </p>
<p>The company reported second quarter fully diluted earnings of $0.45 per share before special charges, compared with $0.39 per diluted share in the year-ago second quarter.</p>
<p>But Johnson Controls said control system orders for performance contracting and from other domestic retrofit markets were only on par with year-ago levels, weaker than the company's forecast.</p>
<p>Its integrated facilities management revenues would be higher than anticipated, the company said.</p>
<p>"Putting all these factors together, our outlook for the full year is consistent with our plan to achieve a double-digit improvement in Johnson Controls operating results," Keyes said.</p>
