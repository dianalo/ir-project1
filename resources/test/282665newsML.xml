<p>The overnight money rate hit a morning high of 6-1/2 percent on year-end demand on Tuesday, but trade was very quiet as most participants already closed their books ahead of the New Year holiday on Wednesday, dealers said.</p>
<p>The overnight rate retreated slightly by midday to stand at 5-1/4 1/8 percent against 5 4-15/16 on Monday. Three-month was virtually unchanged at 5-9/16 7/16 percent.</p>
<p>"Trading has been very quiet on both bid and offer sides and there is also no direction from the U.S.," a local bank dealer said. He expected interbank rates and government paper yields to be steady after the markets reopen on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Longer-dated government paper was little changed with almost no trading at all.</p>
<p>Three-, seven- and 10-year note yields were all unchanged at 6.02, 7.01 and 7.27 percent respectively.</p>
<p>One-month bill yields eased one basis point to 4.33 percent.</p>
