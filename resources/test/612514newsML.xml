<p>The fall of Afghanistan's northern opposition leader General Abdul Rashid Dostum, which culminated in the capture of his capital Mazar-e-Sharif on Saturday afternoon was as rapid as it was unexpected.</p>
<p>One week ago, Dostum seemed to present the strongest challenge to the power of the dominant Taleban movement. He was well equipped with tanks and artillery, his men -- believed to number some 25,000 -- were better trained than their opponents, and he had secure lines of supply from the former Soviet states of Central Asia on Afghanistan's northern border.</p>
<p>However, none of these advantages proved capable of withstanding a tidal wave of Taleban fighters once the first cracks in the structure had started to appear.</p>
<p>Last Monday one of Dostum's most important commanders, his former foreign minister General Abdul Malik, changed sides and declared his support for the Taleban.</p>
<p>Malik was the governor of Faryab province. For 18 months Malik's men had held Dostum's western front line against the Taleban. When he turned the front line was lost.</p>
<p>An Afghan watcher in Kabul put Malik's defection down to a mixture of judgement about the long-term viability of the opposition's resistance to the Taleban and personal grudges.</p>
<p>"I think Malik saw that the opposition had little chance in long term to beat the Taleban or force them to a compromise that would leave any of their power intact," said the analyst, who preferred to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>"But I think what pushed him over the edge was the assassination of his brother last year and then of Haqqani two weeks ago." he said.</p>
<p>Malik's brother Rasool Pahlawan was Dostum's most powerful commander, and a potential challenger for his power. Pahlawan was killed in Mazar-e-Sharif last June in unexplained circumstances.</p>
<p>Mullah Abdur Rahman Haqqani, a member of Pahlawan's faction, was killed along with 10 of his bodyguards two weeks ago, also in Mazar-e-Sharif.</p>
<p>When Malik defected last Monday, with a reported 4,000 men, he handed Faryab province to the Taleban. For three days uncertainty reigned.</p>
<p>The opposition claimed that they were negotiating with Malik to try to bring him back into the alliance. At the same time the opposition was trying to establish a new front line on the eastern border of Faryab, near the town of Shibarghan, Dostum's home town and one of his major strongholds some 130 km (80 miles) from Mazar-e-Sharif.</p>
<p>On Thursday it became clear that the Taleban were on the new opposition front line in numbers. When the end came it was swift.</p>
<p>The Taleban launched an attack on Shibarghan on Saturday morning. By 11.30 (0700 GMT) the town had fallen.</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, the Taleban information minister told reporters in Kabul that their troops were on the way to Mazar-e-Sharif.</p>
<p>As reports of the fall of Shibarghan reached Mazar, law and order collapsed. Dostum's troops fled in tanks and vehicles commandeered from the population. By 5.30 (1300 GMT), Taleban troops were in the town shooting at the pictures of Dostum that hung on all principal buildings and raising their trade-mark white flags.</p>
