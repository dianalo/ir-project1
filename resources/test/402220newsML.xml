<p>The Finnish government said on Tuesday it had agreed on spending ceilings for the two remaining annual budgets of its term in office to 1999.</p>
<p>The five-party left-right-green government capped 1998 budget expenditure at 191 billion markka and set a 192 billion markka ceiling for 1999, it said in a statement.</p>
<p>Total spending in the 1997 state budget approved by parliament is 190.3 billion markka.</p>
<p>The government also set tentative expenditure frames beyond its own term in office, projecting 2000 spending at 190 billion markka and 2001 spending at 191 billion.  </p>
<p>"In creating the (budget) framework the basis has been to implement tight expenditure discipline in all discretionary spending," the government said.</p>
<p>The projections were based on slowing GDP growth in 1998-2001.</p>
<p>"The medium-term projection suggests that growth will slow down from 1998 onwards with the GDP growth rate between 3.8 and 2.8 percent in 1998-2001," the government said.</p>
<p>The finance ministry on February 18 forecast Finnish 1997 GDP growth at 4.6 percent.</p>
