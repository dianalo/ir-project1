<p>Weak Irish government bonds recovered some early losses in quiet trade on Tuesday on the back of benign U.S. data released this afternoon, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Market-friendly U.S. data has steadied European markets and Dublin is moving better after being weaker across the curve in earlier trade," one dealer said.</p>
<p>By 1620 GMT, the eight percent bond due 2000 was 15p weaker at 106.43 to yield 6.03 percent while the eight percent bond due 2006 was also down 15 pence at 107.55 to yield 6.79.</p>
<p>Earlier the U.S. Labour Department employment cost index for the third quarter rose 0.6 percent versus forecasts of 0.8 percent.</p>
<p>The Labour Department said wages and salaries for private industry workers rose 3.3 percent in the year ended September 1996.</p>
<p>News that the U.S. consumer confidence index fell to 106.2 in October brought more encouragement to markets that U.S. interest rates may not have to rise yet to keep inflation in check.</p>
<p>Dealers said markets had a busy schedule this week with important sets of economic data being released in the U.S.</p>
<p>"The Irish market will be watching the U.S. jobless figures on Thursday and payrolls data on Friday to give us an idea of how the U.S. economy is performing," one dealer said.</p>
