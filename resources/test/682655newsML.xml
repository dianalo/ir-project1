<p>Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus said on Tuesday that the ballooning trade deficit should slow, lowering the current account deficit to about seven percent of gross domestic product.</p>
<p>"The deficit of the current account will decline from 8.2 percent of GDP (for 1996) to something around seven percent for the year 1997," Klaus said in an address to the Zofin Forum of Czech business leaders.  </p>
<p>The Czech crown came under strong downward pressure in May, due to, in part, the country's huge trade deficit.</p>
<p>Some private economists have estimated the 1997 current account deficit at between eight percent and more than 11 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Klaus, an economics professor, said he agreed with most of the new economic forecasts released by the Czech Statistical Bureau (CSU) on Monday, but was sceptical about the upper range of its forecast for economic growth of 2.0-3.0 percent in 1997.</p>
<p>"I would be a little bit more cautious (than three percent)," Klaus said. "In many respects we can agree with yesterday's relatively optimistic prognosis of the CSU"</p>
<p>The CSU said that while many economists expected a possible recession in 1997 after a contraction in industrial production earlier in the first quarter, that it still saw industrial output growing by a real 2.4 to 4.5 percent this year.</p>
<p>The CSU said on Monday, the current account deficit would equal 6.7-7.3 percent this year.  </p>
<p>The central bank was forced to float the currency on May 27, and raised key interest rates to fight off speculators and counter the effects of a more than 10 percent fall in the currency.</p>
<p>The crown has since recovered much of the losses since it was floated.</p>
<p>The government followed the central bank measures with its second austerity package of budget cuts in as many months, in an effort to cut domestic demand which had been driving the trade deficit.</p>
<p>Klaus said the economic recovery depended on "political stability, persuading the market about the exchange rate of the crown, holding back aggregate demand and slowing imbalances through fiscal restrictions but also by not overshooting monetary restrictions."</p>
<p>Klaus had been critical of central bank steps to tighten monetary policy last year, blaming it for the slow down in economic growth.</p>
<p>He later agreed with the centre-right coalition government to back a tighter monetary policy as part of the emergency economic measures adopted in late May.</p>
