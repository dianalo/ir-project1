<p>French barley prices rose to match wheat on Tuesday as traders sent in offers for a 1.2 million tonne purchase tender being held by Saudi Arabia, dealers said.</p>
<p>Barley gained 10 francs a tonne to at least 865 francs a tonne for January delivery at Rouen, with some reports of 870 francs being done on a small quantity.</p>
<p>Wheat was pegged at 865 francs a tonne.</p>
<p>At Dunkirk, favoured for exports to Saudi Arabia because of its larger berthing capacity, barley was up 15 francs at 875 francs for January and edging higher, traders said.</p>
<p>"There are no sellers," said one broker, noting that feed barley supplies were drying up in the face of good returns for malting barley whenever quality allowed.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia was on Tuesday seeking 1.2 million tonnes of feed barley for January and February shipment.</p>
<p>There was no immediate word of prices offered into the tender, but traders noted that current French prices pointed to offers around $140 to $145 a tonne based on the last European Union refund of 28.99 Ecus per tonne.</p>
<p>Traders said 600,000 or 700,000 tonnes of the Saudi business might go to Europe, but much depended on whether the Commission was prepared to risk further upward pressure on internal prices.</p>
<p>Brussels has traditionally backed off as soon as barley prices touch parity with wheat, they said.</p>
<p>Wheat was supported by logistical problems stemming from frozen canals in eastern France. But sentiment in maize was damapened by fears the EU might approve new imports from the United States to Spain at Thursday's grain export tender.</p>
<p>Thursday's auction is the first since December 19, following a two-week break over Christmas and New Year.</p>
<p>French domestic grain prices exclude carrying charges of 3.64 francs for every half month between August 1, 1996, and the delivery period in question.</p>
