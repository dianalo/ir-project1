<p>Wall Street stocks are expected to open lower with bonds on Wednesday, after a rally which took the Dow industrials to two consecutive closing highs.</p>
<p>Analysts said that weakness in Cisco Systems Inc following its third quarter earnings could color the market today, putting pressure on the high techs.</p>
<p>"The market has run the one-minute mile and is entitled to a pause," said Prudential Securities analyst Larry Wachtel "The bond market, the gatekeeper for stocks, is down.  It looks stretched.  Yesterday's auction did not go that well."  </p>
<p>"The Cisco quarter was okay, but it didn't blow anyone away," Wachtel said.  "The stock gave ground after the market closed yesterday and that might color the action of the high technology sector once trading gets underway."</p>
<p>Bear Stearns said it cut its July quarter estimate to $0.56 per share from $0.59 per share and its 1998 year projection to $2.65 per share from $2.80 to reflect lower growth rate assumptions of about 35 percent per year, down from its previous expectation of 40 percent per annum.  </p>
<p>Tokyo stocks ended down on Wednesday after the key index had racked up huge gains in the past five sessions.  The 225-share Nikkei average fell 132.02 points or 0.65 percent to 20,048.90.  Its June futures slipped 110 points to 20,080.</p>
<p>In London, the FTSE 100 Index was up 36.4 at 4555.7.</p>
<p>Also in London, U.S. shares were moderately lower in thin trade on Wednesday, with many investors absent ahead of a European holiday on Thursday.  Fluor Corp fell four to 52 after the company said late Tuesday it expected to report a loss for the second quarter of about $70 million, or $0.83 a share.  </p>
<p>Intel Corp was up $1/4 to $158-1/4 after dropping $4-1/2 in New York on Tuesday after the company warned that there was a possible flaw with the company's Pentium chips.</p>
<p>Chrysler Corp was up $1/4 to $31-1/4 after the New York Times newspaper said the automaker had reached an agreement with the United Auto Workers union which would end a nearly month-long strike that has shut down production of some high-profit vehicles.</p>
<p>The dollar hovered near 125.50 yen in Tokyo and dipped to lows beneath 1.72 marks and 125 yen in Europe.  </p>
<p>U.S. Treasuries were lower, with the long bond down 8/32 to yield 6.91 percent.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street writes that investors in stocks of high-tech and pharmaceutical companies should be wary.  A study warns that a growing number of the companies are using an obscure accounting rule that some critics say can inflate subsequent earnings artificially.</p>
<p>The New York Times Market Place writes that the nation's two biggest savings and loan institutions are fighting for a third, Great Western Financial Corp in a conflict that has all the pettiness of a schoolyard brawl.</p>
