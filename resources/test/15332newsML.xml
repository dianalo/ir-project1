<p>Tokyo rubber futures ended mixed on Monday after the spot August expired firmer than Friday's close, traders said.</p>
<p>The spot August contract expired at 134.0 yen, up 0.5 yen from Friday's close. Deliveries totalled 1,746 lots.</p>
<p>The results of the spot expiry were generally in line with market expectations and did not provide fresh incentives to the market, they said. "Firmer prices in rubber-producing countries will support the market here, but further gains are likely to be capped by long-liquidation from private investors," an analyst at a commodity broker said.</p>
