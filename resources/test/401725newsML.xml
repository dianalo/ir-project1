<p>India is likely to reduce its 27 percent duty on crude oil imports in its 1997/98 budget to be announced on Friday, analysts said.</p>
<p>They also expect some tinkering in the tariff schedule for refined products.</p>
<p>Analysts will keenly watch whether the new import tariffs show a differential of at least 10 percent between crude and the refined barrel.</p>
<p>Unless imported products are penalised by more than 10 percent there will be little incentive for Indian oil companies to build the refineries needed to keep pace with ballooning product demand.</p>
<p>The R-committee, which has made recommendations to the government on the restructuring and de-control of the oil industry, has said import tariffs need to be lowered as a pre-requisite to liberalising the refining sector.</p>
<p>The committee, a panel of economists, government officials and state-run oil company executives, said crude import tariffs should be brought down to between zero and five percent.</p>
<p>"I don't think the government will move so fast on crude tariffs, but I think it will be a pretty sizeable reduction," Sanjeev Patni, analyst at W.I Carr, said.</p>
<p>Other Asian economies have zero or minimal import tariffs levied on oil, according to Shrivatsa Kumar, analyst at Jardine Fleming in Bombay.</p>
<p>Currently the import duty on the main products are as follows; gasoline 32 percent, diesel 32 percent, jet fuel 32 percent, fuel oil 32 percent, liquefied petroleum gas 12 percent, and kerosene zero.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram will seek to lower import tariffs also as a way of alleviating some of the burden on the oil pool account deficit.</p>
<p>The oil pool deficit is effectively the amount government owes oil companies for selling oil products to Indian consumers way below world prices.</p>
<p>Oil companies shoulder the burden of the deficit while they wait for the state to pay them back.</p>
<p>The government is under pressure to announce increases in state-controlled domestic refined product prices to get the oil pool deficit back under control.</p>
<p>Recent official estimates for the size of the deficit at the end of 1996/97 (March 31) range between 155 billion and 184 billion rupees ($4.3-$5.1 billion).</p>
<p>Patni said Chidambaram may use the budget to buy time before raising product prices.</p>
<p>Rationalisation of tariffs along with a reimbursement of the oil pool account of 45 billion rupees appropriated by the previous government when the pool was in surplus will cut 70 billion rupees off the oil pool deficit and buy a little breathing space before announcing a price rise.</p>
<p>But another analyst at a Bombay brokerage, who requested anonymity, believed the money siphoned off from the oil pool account will never be returned.</p>
<p>"Government spending is a black hole. What goes in won't come back."</p>
