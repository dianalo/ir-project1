<p>The scales of justice needed reinforcement when a a 400-pound admitted pimp faced sentencing in Manhattan Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Robert York, 49, had to be hoisted by a crane onto a specially fitted gurney and taken up a freight elevator to the 15th floor courtroom for his sentencing before Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Rena Uviller.</p>
<p>Prosecutors on Thursday said York, accused of running a prostitution ring from his Manhattan apartment, was sentenced to nine months in jail. He had faced a seven-year prison term for promoting prostitution before confessing and pleading guilty to running a prostitution ring.</p>
<p>York, who is nicknamed "Fat Cat", was sentenced late on Wednesday after the Corrections Department inadvertently produced him in court a day earlier than scheduled.</p>
<p>York was brought to the courthouse steps in a huge truck. It took several officers about 15 minutes to secure him to the oversized chair.</p>
<p>"The judge decided that because of the hassle of getting him in and out of the courthouse, she went ahead and sentenced him Wednesday," a district attorney's spokeman said.</p>
<p>A paraplegic as the result of a back injury, York has been confined to the hospital unit at the Rikers Island jail since his arrest in January. Detectives said he had a stable of young girls including a teenager working for him.</p>
