<p>A Taiwanese turbo-prop airliner on a domestic flight crashed on the offshore island of Matsu on Sunday, killing all 16 people on board, officials said.</p>
<p>Rescuers found one critically injured survivor but she died on the way to hospital on Matsu, Formosa Airlines vice president Tsai Chia-ching told reporters.</p>
<p>The 19-seater twin-engine Formosa Airlines Dornier 228, carrying 14 passengers, a pilot and co-pilot, was on its way from the Taiwanese capital Taipei to Matsu, which lies six miles (10 km) off mainland China.</p>
<p>The aircraft took off at 7.30 a.m. (2330 GMT Saturday) from Taipei domestic airport and lost contact with Matsu's control tower at around 8.14 a.m. just before it was scheduled to land, officials said.</p>
<p>Eyewitness said there had been an explosion and a fire after the crash. Local authorities found the wreckage in the Jade Mountain area, west of Matsu airport.</p>
<p>"The bodies recovered were badly burned and unrecognisable," a state television reporter at the crash site said.</p>
<p>All victims' bodies had been found, officials said.</p>
<p>Formosa Airlines chartered helicopters to transport grief-stricken relatives to Matsu to identify the bodies.</p>
<p>The aircraft's flight voice and data recorders had been recovered and Civil Aeronautics Administration officials had begun an investigation into the crash, the administration's director-general, Tsai Tui, said.</p>
<p>Tsai said the administration had ruled out poor weather as the cause.</p>
<p>"It was raining at the time, but visibility was about 6,000 metres, (6,600 yards) " he said.</p>
<p>It was the fourth accident involving a Formosa Airlines Dornier 228 in four years and the second on Matsu.</p>
<p>In April, 1996, a 228 crashed into sea shortly before it was due to land on the island. Six people were killed and 11 rescued.</p>
<p>In February 1993, six people died when a 228 crashed into the sea off eastern Taiwan. Four months later, one person was injured when a 228's landing gear snapped on landing on another outlying island.</p>
<p>Government spokesman David Lee said Premier Lien Chan was shocked and saddened by the accident.</p>
<p>"Premier Lien urges relevant authorities to launch a probe into the accident and to improve Matsu airport's safety as soon as possible," Lee said on television.</p>
