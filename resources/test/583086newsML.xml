<p>Italy's De Longhi group, a well-known maker of air conditioning equipment, is looking to be quoted on the Milan stock market by the year 2000.</p>
<p>"We want to be quoted to grow on a world level. We have the ideas and development possibilities," chairman Giuseppe De Longhi told reporters at the presentation of a new ecological air conditioner.</p>
<p>The company, currently controlled by a series of Luxembourg holdings, had 1996 turnover of 1.40 trillion lire of which 65 percent came from exports.</p>
<p>Profit in 1996 was in line with that of 1995, De Longhi said without giving figures.</p>
<p>The group has nine plants in northern Italy but is also looking to manufacture abroad. Brazil is "a very good market where we are seeking to set up a joint venture to manufacture there," De Longhi said. Other areas of interest were the United States and Croatia.</p>
