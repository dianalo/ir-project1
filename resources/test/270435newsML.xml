<p>Cellex Biosciences Inc said Friday it does not expect to report a profit for the current fiscal first quarter, and its results for the full year fiscal 1997 could be hampered by a shortage of cash resources.</p>
<p>On September 30 Cellex said it had a working capital deficit of $1,249,677, compared to a deficiit of $4,548,961 a year earlier.</p>
<p>Cellex today reported a fiscal fourth quarter (ended September 30) profit of $0.15 a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $1.17.  </p>
<p>For the year, its loss narrowed to $0.55 a share from $2.97 a year earlier.</p>
<p>The company said the rise in revenues for the year was due primarily to an increase in sales of its LSL Biolafitte stirred tank and freeze dryer systems, and also an increase in contract production services revenue.  </p>
<p>The company saidits net results continue to be hurt by interest expense on its debt. Net interest expense accounted for $1,187,672 of the net loss in fiscal 1996 and $1,088,960 in fiscal 1995.</p>
<p>Cellex said its European operations posted an operating profit of $435,518 for fiscal 1996, the first operating proit since it acquired LSL in December 1993.</p>
<p>The company said it was successful in rescheduling the payment terms of certain debt obligations during fiscal 1996 and completed a public offering of securities.</p>
<p>Cellex said it continues to seek capital from various sources, including term loans, lines of credit and equity financings.</p>
<p>"Our number one objective is obtaining working capital to allow us to build and ship our backlog, continue the marketing programs initiated in 1996, and start up the production build of our new Prelude bench-top stirred tank systems, all of which are necessary to implement our strategy of achieving increased revenues, sustainable quarterly profitability and positive cash flow," Richard Sakowicz, president, said.</p>
<p>Cellex provides cell processing products and services to health care and biotechnology markets.</p>
