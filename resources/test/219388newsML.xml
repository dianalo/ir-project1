<p>American Filtrona Corp said Wednesday it plans to continue merger negotiations with WBT Holdings LLC after a lawsuit involving several trusts that own the company's shares was settled.</p>
<p>The lawsuit involved beneficiaries of certain trusts for the benefit of members of the family of former Chairman R.H. Bunzl and a co-trustee of those trusts.</p>
<p>The lawsuit had alleged that the trustee's concurrent service as co-trustee for the Walter Bunzl trusts as well as the R.H. Bunzl trusts represented a conflict of interest with respect to the proposed merger.</p>
<p>R.H. and Walter Bunzl were brothers. Walter Bunzl was a 28 percent shareholder of WBT Holdings who left his stock in family trusts, some of which are associated with R.H. Bunzl.</p>
<p>The company did not disclose the terms of the settlement.</p>
