<headline>US debt futures end down on data, supply concerns.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1996-12-16</dateline>

<p>U.S. debt futures finished near the day's lows, as thin volume, signs of U.S. economic growth and supply concerns conspired to steadily drag prices lower, traders and analysts said.</p>
<p>"Its been an average year at best and I think people would be very happy to have it over with," one bond market analyst said about the continued selling pressure.</p>
<p>Stronger-than-expected U.S. November industrial production and capacity utilization data, coupled with the rise in crude oil prices and the housing market index gave dealers and traders fresh excuses for taking profits.  </p>
<p>"It hasn't taken much volume to send this market lower," one bond futures floor source said. "We move so easily on thin orders."</p>
<p>March T-bonds broke below the pivot point of 113-00 after the production and utilization data, and inched lower on the rise in the early December Homebuilders' housing market index, traders said. One wire service said the index rose to 53, from 51 in November.</p>
<p>Earlier in the morning, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production rose 0.9 percent and utilization increased to 83.3, higher than trade estimates.  </p>
<p>Traders, on average, were looking for production to increase 0.6 percent and use to rise to 83.0.</p>
<p>While the data did not shake market expectations for a steady monetary policy decision out of the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) Tuesday meeting, the rise in crude oil prices and the lower U.S. dollar frayed some nerves.</p>
<p>"There has just been a continued concern about the foreign purchases of dollar-denominated assets," one trader said. "Those concerns from last week haven't gone away."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, crude oil prices rallied more than a dollar a barrel on forecasts for prolonged cold weather in the U.S.  </p>
<p>Floor traders were also nervous ahead of the two- and five-year note auction this week. The U.S. Treasury department will sell $18.25 billion two-year notes on Wednesday, December 18 and sell $12.5 billion five-year notes on Thursday, December 19.</p>
<p>One analyst said he was slightly relieved March T-bonds managed to close above support at 112-22/32 to 112-23/32.</p>
<p>"We are in good shape," he said about the technical condition of the market. "We should not re-test that area any time soon."  </p>
<p>At the end of pit trade, March bonds were 16/32 lower at 112-24/32, 10-year notes were off 08/32 at 109-16/32, June T-bills were down four bps at 94.90, March Eurodollars were two bps lower at 94.45 and June Eurodollars were down four bps at 94.32.
