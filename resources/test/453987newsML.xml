<p>Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine said on Wednesday that jobless data proved that Britain was "booming" and warned that the country's "excellent record would be at risk under a Labour government".</p>
<p>Speaking after figures showing a 68,200 drop in unemployment in February from January, Heseltine said even Britain's worst jobs blackspot regions now had jobless rates comparable with the most prosperous regions of Germany.</p>
<p>"Britain is booming. Britain is doing extraordinarily well. The figures clearly reveal it," Heseltine told a news conference at Conservative headquarters designed to boost the party ahead of a May 1 election.</p>
<p>"Our excellent record would be at risk under a Labour government," he added. "Under Labour Britain simply would not work as effectively as it does today, so don't risk your jobs with a Labour government."</p>
<p>The news conference began with a series of messages flashed on a screen detailing monthly falls in the jobless total since last August, a total drop of 378,900.</p>
<p>Heseltine listed 10 reasons why he believed that Labour would end the record of shrinking dole queues, including its intention to bring in a national minimum wage, to join the European Union social chapter, and to increase trade union powers.</p>
<p>"The choice for Britain is...between a party tbat understands how to get unemployment down and one that does not," Heseltine said.</p>
