<p>China's cultural mandarins will curb the building of nightclubs and video parlours in a drive to wipe out decadent culture and ideas, state media said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The Ministry of Culture...will improve its management over the cultural market in 1997, trying every strategy it can to eliminate decadent elements in the country," the Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>The ministry would curb the building of new nightclubs and night-time video parlours, Xinhua said.</p>
<p>The authorities would set an "appropriate ratio" for the number of imported and domestic programmes available in China, the agency said without elaborating.</p>
<p>"The cultural market can never be a hotbed for decadent ideology and culture," Xinhua quoted Meng Xiaosi, director of the ministry's Cultural Market Bureau, as saying.</p>
<p>The cultural clean-up drive would help China's ideological and ethical undertakings, the China Daily said.</p>
<p>"The cultural sphere...usually helps to spread patriotism as well as other correct ideas among the public," the official newspaper said.</p>
<p>The ministry had also vowed to eliminate piracy of artistic works and "vulgar" performances, Xinhua said, without giving details on how censors would decide on what was vulgar.</p>
<p>"The ministry plans to basically wipe out the country's influx of pornography and protect intellectual property rights by the year 2000," it said.</p>
<p>Market-oriented reforms launched by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in the late 1970s have led to a proliferation of dance halls, cinemas and karaoke bars in China, once nearly devoid of entertainment under the strict puritan rule of Mao Zedong.</p>
<p>Beijing has been under intense international pressure to crack down on piracy of movies, music and software.</p>
<p>China and the United States went to the brink of a trade war last June over Beijing's failure to rein in such piracy.</p>
