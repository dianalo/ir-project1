<p>The U.S. strikes against Iraq will stoke the tension that has made the Gulf a multi-billion dollar arms bazaar, Western diplomats and industry executives said on Monday.</p>
<p>"It may sound mercenary, but when you cut it down to the bone, security is a major concern for Gulf states and that means they will need weapons," an executive of a major U.S. arms company said of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's sweep into northern Iraq.</p>
<p>The Iraqi leader's defiant speech on state television, wearing a field marshall's uniform, after Washington retaliated last week with cruise missile attacks was a reminder of the continuing tension in the region.</p>
<p>Industry executives said this latest conflict would not trigger an arms-buying spree, but tension means long-term gains for Western arms makers seeking to sell to Gulf states that rely on U.S. protection from Iraq and Iran.</p>
<p>"This does not mean a windfall. But over the long term, the Gulf states will be concerned with security," said the executive.</p>
<p>Gulf states have stressed the need to preserve Iraq's sovereignty and territorial unity but diplomats say hawks Saudi Arabia and Kuwait do not want Saddam to think he can act with impunity.</p>
<p>"These types of tensions will continue to make the Gulf a valuable market in the future," said a Western diplomat in the United Arab Emirates, which has emerged as a major player in the international arms market.</p>
<p>Armed with vast oil wealth, Gulf Arab states haunted by memories of Iraq's lightning invasion of Kuwait in 1990 are bristling with high-tech weapons, with more deals on the horizon.</p>
<p>Western firms are competing to sell the UAE up to 80 long-range strike aircraft worth up to $6 billion. Lockheed Martin Corp of the United States and France's Dassault Aviation are remaining bidders in what is expected to be the last contract of its size this century.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is also a key customer in the international arms market, with deals worth $75.9 billion concluded between 1987 and 1994. About a third of state spending has gone on defence and security, including deals with Western allies such as the United States, Britain and France.</p>
<p>Industry sources say any Iranian or Iraqi attacks would tighten alliances between Gulf states and Western countries and could pave the way for more arms sales.</p>
<p>"The latest problems with Iraq will not mean an immediate rise in sales but will have a long-term effect. But military action by Iraq would mean Gulf states would speed up plans to buy weapons," said another executive from a leading U.S. defence company.</p>
<p>Despite Gulf states' budget constraints caused by weaker oil prices and enormous Gulf War costs, diplomats and industry sources say volatility in the Gulf guarantees more profits to arms suppliers.</p>
<p>"If you follow CNN, it seems as if the Gulf is a war zone. The tensions are good for arms makers," said a Western diplomat.</p>
