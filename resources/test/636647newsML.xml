<p>Mexico's new multi-year inflation targets may help interest rates decline more easily, Banco de Mexico governor Miguel Mancera said in a taped interview with Reuters Financial Television in Interlaken, Switzerland.</p>
<p>The interview was conducted on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Mexico has adopted a multi-annual inflation target and the purpose is to bring inflation down to 12.5 percent in 1998, 10 percent in 1999 and to 7.5 in the year 2000," Mancera said.  </p>
<p>"This is a very useful for investment and economic forecasting generally, as interest rates may come down more easily if there is an inflation targetting for several years," he said.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Mexican government outlined a new economic plan, which included projections until the year 2000.</p>
<p>Mancera said that real interest rates depend on the fundamentals of the economy.  </p>
<p>"What can be done is by having a successful stabilization program, to help lower nominal interest rates and likely also real interest rates, as interest rates do not command a risk premium if inflation is lower," he said.</p>
<p>"So by bringing down inflation, the peso does not have to depreciate as much as if inflation is high," he said.</p>
<p>Mancera reiterated that Mexico has a floating exchange rate regime.</p>
<p>The central bank governor said he did not see any slowdown in capital inflows tied to direct foreign invesment.</p>
<p>"There is no slowdown in capital inflows with respect to direct foreign investment. On the contrary, this kind of investment has been growing notably in the last ten years," he said.</p>
<p>"What may be contained to relatively small volumes is short-term portfolio investment. I think it is a good thing that we do not get much influx of this kind of capital," Mancera said.</p>
