<p>Cool temperatures and occasional rain continued to hamper German harvesting which was expected to end over the weekend, the DWD meteorological office said.</p>
<p>"It's too cold for maize and sugarbeet to prosper and crops will be two weeks late," a DWD source said.</p>
<p>"The rain means grain growers have to pay for drying."</p>
<p>"But winter rape and barley have been helped by good soil moisture contents."</p>
<p>DWD's weekly report forecast maximum day temperatures of seven to 15 degrees in the period to September 19 after maximum temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees in the week to Sept 11.</p>
<p>A grains analyst said wheat qualities were average but the rye crop showed generally lower falling Hagberg numbers as large parts had been hit by rain in August.</p>
<p>Large parts of the crop had falling numbers below 100, where it becomes difficult to market the rye for baking but the definite cut-off point was 75.</p>
<p>Malting barley showed proteins around 11.5 percent, the desirable content for brewing, and volumes were high, he said.</p>
<p>Reliable quality tests, which are especially crucial for wheat prices, will now be delayed until the end of Septmeber.</p>
<p>Researchers in some regions have only received 25 percent of the necessary samples, due to the delays and varied results.</p>
<p>Farm organisation DBV put grain drying costs at 10 to 35 marks per tonne, to reach the standard 14.5 percent. --Vera Eckert, Hamburg newsroom, +49-40-41903275</p>
