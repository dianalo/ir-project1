<p>A blazing run-a-ball century from wicketkeeper Romesh Kaluwitharana failed to save Sri Lanka from an innings defeat in the first test in New Zealand on Monday.</p>
<p>New Zealand, back to winning ways after a 2-0 home series loss to England, take an unbeatable 1-0 lead in the two-match series into the next test starting in Hamilton on Friday.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka started the day in the hopeless position of 37 without loss after being forced to follow on 364 behind.</p>
<p>But the tourists showed defiance, first through a well-compiled 50 by Sanath Jayasuriya and later in a fighting century stand between Kaluwitharana and Chaminda Vaas.</p>
<p>They finally surrendered with the total on 328, shortly before the scheduled close of play on the fourth day.</p>
<p>Kaluwitharana came to the crease with Sri Lanka at 115 for five and proceeded to smash the Kiwi attack to all corners in reaching 103.</p>
<p>His scintillating 137 run partnership with Vaas ended when he offered a low, hard return catch to teenage left arm spinner Daniel Vettori.</p>
<p>The century included 13 fours and two sixes and was his second in tests.</p>
<p>For New Zealand the test was a welcome reversal of form.</p>
<p>The team went into the match in some disarray, having lost to a mediocre England side and failed to win a test at home in three years. Lee Germon was dumped as skipper last week in favour of 23-year old Stephen Fleming, the youngest captain in the country's history.</p>
<p>New Zealand were further hit by the late withdrawal of fast bowler Geoff Allott just before the test began, but proceeded to dominate every session of the test.</p>
<p>Victory was built around a superb unbeaten 267 by man-of-the-match Bryan Young. It was the second highest test innings by a New Zealander after Martin Crowe's 299, also against Sri Lanka six years ago.</p>
<p>Sri Lanka's hopes of saving the game with a big second innings were dealt a series of blows in the morning session when they lost openers Roshan Mahanama for 21, Jayasuriya for 50, dangerman Aravinda de Silva for nought and Marvan Atapattu for 22.</p>
<p>While Sri Lanka had more than their share of misfortune in the match, the New Zealanders made their own luck with some brilliant fielding.</p>
<p>Arjuna Ranatunga went to a stupendous catch by Matt Horne at mid-wicket on 13. The Sri Lanakan captain tried to hit left-arm spinner Daniel Vettori over Horne but the fielder showed great athleticism to leap high and snare the ball in his right hand.</p>
<p>Hashan Tillekaratne was out 18 runs later as Sri Lanka slumped to 133 for six when he was run out to a brilliant piece of fielding by 12th man Chris Harris.</p>
<p>All the bowlers contributed equally but most penetrating was Simon Doull, who added to his five wicket first innings bag with three for 82.</p>
