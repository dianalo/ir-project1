<title>USA: CME live cattle calls mixed, feeders steady to up.</title>
<headline>CME live cattle calls mixed, feeders steady to up.</headline>
<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-01-14</dateline>
<text>
<p>Early calls on CME live cattle futures ranged from 0.100 cent lower to 0.100 higher while feeder cattle were expected steady to 0.150 cent higher, livestock analysts said.</p>
<p>Some analysts anticipated carryover weakness in live cattle futures following a technical selloff after failing to set a new high Monday and a lack of direct steer trade at the expected higher price levels.</p>
<p>However, others look for support following stabilized beef trade and continued concern over cold weather. Packers should pay up for fed cattle soon.  </p>
<p>Feeder cattle futures were seen showing early support following firmer fundamentals. The latest CME feeder cattle index was higher and early indications on corn futures were lower, analysts said.</p>
<p>The latest CME feeder cattle index was up $0.46 at $68.33 per cwt. The index has risen nearly $4 since the first of the year.</p>
