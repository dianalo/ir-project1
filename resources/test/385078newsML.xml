<p>Germany's birth rate rose last year for the first time since unification in 1990, with a particularly strong rise in the formerly communist east, the Federal Statistics Office said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Some 789,000 babies were born in 1996, up 3.8 percent on 1995, in the country of 81.5 million inhabitants.</p>
<p>In eastern Germany, where births plunged because of uncertainty caused by the social upheaval following unification, the number of babies born leaped 11.5 percent to 92,000.</p>
<p>But that figure was still far below the birth rate in pre-unification East Germany, where 199,000 babies were born in 1989, the year of the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p>
<p>Demographers say the post-unification plunge in the east German birth rate was the biggest decline in recorded history, and coincided with an increased desire among west German women to pursue careers or save money for holidays and cars.</p>
<p>Even the rise in the number of babies born in 1996 was not enough to reverse a steady decline in the overall German population, as deaths still outnumbered births by 90,000.</p>
