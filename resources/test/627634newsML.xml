<p>The economy shot ahead at its fastest clip in nine years as 1997 opened, the Commerce Department figures confirmed on Friday but showed increasing signs of waning momentum as spring began.</p>
<p>Revised figures for first-quarter gross domestic domestic indicated that national output expanded at a booming 5.8 percent annual rate in the three months from January through March -- the strongest for any quarter since a 6 percent rate in the final quarter of 1987.</p>
<p>That was modestly higher than an initial estimate of 5.6 percent growth issued a month ago -- mainly because of higher production for inventories and brisker overseas sales -- and was well ahead of the fourth quarter's 3.8 percent pace of expansion.</p>
<p>Analysts said GDP peaked in the first quarter and was headed for subdued growth for the rest of the year, likely in the range of 2 percent to 2.5 percent. But they were split over whether it will ease enough to head off more hikes in interest rates by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>A separate Commerce report showing new-home sales dropped in April at the sharpest rate in six months fit with other recent indicators of continued slowing in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Sales fell 7.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 772,000 units. But that came after a steep revision to March sales to show a 2 percent increase to 836,000 -- the strongest pace since 857,000 a year in April of 1986.</p>
<p>A third report from the Purchasing Management Association of Chicago said its Chicagoland Business Barometer fell to a seasonally adjusted 56.8 in May from 57.2 in April. While any reading over 50 signals growth, the rate was slightly less vigorous.</p>
<p>Economist Sung Won Sohn of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis said the economy was clearly poised to begin decelerating for the rest of the year but added that the Fed may want to insure the slowdown by raising interest rates again in July.</p>
<p>Costlier credit dampens consumer demand and makes business borrowing more expensive. Fed policy-makers boosted short-term rates a quarter percentage point in March but left rates unchanged May 20. They meet again to plot interest-rate strategy on July 1-2.</p>
<p>"The bottom line is that first-quarter economic growth was much higher than desired and the lion's share of it came from inventory-building," Sohn said. "Factories have been humming, producing more goods in the face of waning sales."</p>
<p>The GDP report backed up that view.</p>
<p>"The upward revision to real GDP in the first quarter reflects upward revisions to inventory investment and to exports that more than offset downward revisions to consumer spending," the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p>GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced by workers and capital within U.S. borders and is the broadest measure of total economic activity.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department said its revised estimates showed that businesses added to their inventories at the fastest rate in two years during the first quarter, up $51.4 billion instead of the $46.1 billion estimated a month ago.</p>
<p>While inventory-building bolsters the economy in the period in which it occurs, it generally foreshadows slower GDP growth ahead because business strives to keep production in line with sales.</p>
<p>Trade also stimulated the economy more than initially thought, as exports increased at a $23.1-billion rate in the first quarter instead of $17 billion as the Commerce Department reported last month.</p>
<p>But personal consumption spending -- the fuel for about two-thirds of national economic activity -- was not quite as robust as estimated a month ago. Spending advanced at a $66.2 billion rate rather than $73.5 billion, the Commerce Department said.</p>
<p>Philadelphia-based economist Joel Naroff of First Union Corp. said automakers already were trimming production in the face of buyer restraint and that likely will extend to more industries.</p>
<p>"It appears as if spending did decelerate sharply in the second quarter and if businesses find they cannot move their bloated stocks, they will be running sales and slowing production," Naroff said.</p>
<p>Real final sales -- a measure of GDP that subtracts out changes in business inventories and that is closely tracked by economists as an indicator of demand -- was revised down to a 3.8 percent increase from last month's estimated 3.9 percent and from a 4.9 percent advance in the fourth quarter last year.</p>
