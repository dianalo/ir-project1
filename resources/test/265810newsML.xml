<p>"There has indeed been a drop in foreign investment approvals this year," he told reporters after meeting President Suharto. "There were several mega-projects approved last year, but this year such projects were not many."</p>
<p>He said, however, 959 projects were approved between January and mid-December this year, compared with 799 projects during the whole of 1995.</p>
<p>"The projects included the chemical, agricultural and property sectors," he said.</p>
