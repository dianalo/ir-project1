<headline>WEEK AHEAD-AUSTRALIAN MARKETS TO FELL U.S. IMPACT.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-08-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>A large pullback in U.S. markets on signs of improving economic growth will see Australian markets under pressure at the start of this week, even though the local rate debate is whether or not rates will be cut</p>
<p>The U.S. stock market, dollar and bonds all weakened markedly on Friday as concerns of inflation pressures and possible U.S. rate rises emerged, and the focus is expected to remain on the U.S. through the week.</p>
<p>Most important for many is Wednesday's U.S. retail trade data, but producer and consumer price data will also be closely watched.  </p>
<p>Locally, there is no data of significance out this week, with the major event being a speech by Reserve Bank Governor Ian Macfarlane in Perth on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Macfarlane will be talking on monetary policy and growth, and economists will be looking for clues as to the direction of monetary policy in Macfarlane's first public speech in Australia since mid-May.</p>
<p>In that time, the RBA has cut official cash rates twice and also announced the sale of two-thirds of gold reserves -- something of particular importance to Western Australia as it produces about 70 percent of Australia's gold.  </p>
<p>The market will also receive an update on the pace of private and public sector wages growth when final May quarter average weekly ordinary time earnings data are released on Thursday.</p>
<p>While of importance -- the May 23 rate cut came the day after the final February quarter data was released -- the data's impact this time around has been lessened by the July 30 rate cut. However, it will add to the debate about whether rates will be cut again.  </p>
<p>Westpac senior international economist Helen Camp expects private sector AWOTE to rise 0.6 percent in the quarter, or 3.2 percent in annual terms.</p>
<p>"All up, we expect the wages data to further support our view that the RBA can cut rates one more time," she said</p>
<p>AUSTRALIAN BONDS (10-yr yield Fri close 6.61 pct, +0.13)</p>
<p>Once the market sorts itself out on Monday's open after the U.S. sell off, RBA Governor Macfarlane's speech will form the centrepiece for the debt market in a week that is fairly light on the major data front.  </p>
<p>As U.S. 30-year Treasury yields rose by 11 points on Friday local 10-year bonds dropped 13 points in SYCOM, taking them to their lowest level since the middle of last month.</p>
<p>Bonds are expected to be on the defensive at the open, with Treasuries seen holding a bearish tone ahead of the key retail trade and price data in the middle of the week.</p>
<p>While close attention will be paid to U.S. developments, the market will be looking to Macfarlane for clues over the monetary policy outlook and whether the official rate cut to 5.0 percent two weeks ago is the last in the cycle.  </p>
<p>Bill futures have been trading at a modest discount to the official rate cut, even after Friday's U.S. sell off, with the market not yet ruling out the possibility of another easing.</p>
<p>Final second quarter wages data on Thursday may cause a stir if there is an upward revision from the preliminary 3.7 percent annual rate, although with a rate cut already in place the data would have to see a significant upward move towards the RBA's 4.5 percent 'line in the sand' to cause notably negative reaction.</p>
<p>AUSTRALIAN DOLLAR (Fri close NYK: US$0.7347, SYD US$0.7311)  </p>
<p>The dollar has bounced of Friday's two-year low just under US$0.73 cents, but remains vulnerable to the downside as long as there is speculation of another rate cut.</p>
<p>While the dollar did move off its lows on Friday, the bounce was seen lacking conviction normally associated with a recovery from a rapid fall to a low.</p>
<p>Technically, break belwo US$0.73 would see the unit targeting US$0.7250 and then US$0.7180, traders said.  </p>
<p>"Another difficult week seems in store for the Australian dollar, although any indication that monetary policy is on hold for the time being could help shore up the US$0.73 floor under the currency," Commonwealth Bank senior economist Michael Blythe said.</p>
<p>Unlike bonds and equities, which are likely to mirror the bearish tone of U.S. markets, the dollar may find some comfort in the talk of higher U.S. rates to the extent it is seen reducing the likelihood of another cut here.</p>
<p>AUSTRALIAN STOCKS(All Ords Fri close: 2,711.4, - 6.3)  </p>
<p>Wall Steet's large losses on Friday and continued turmoil in market giant BHP are seen keeping the All Ordinaries index in the doldrums, at least at the start of the week.</p>
<p>Equity market participants will also have to contend with the light flow of June 30 profit results building this week and for the month after that to the deadline of September 12.</p>
<p>"It will depend on Wall Street and BHP but otherwise it looks okay. The company results are without a doubt the main focus," said a dealer at a Sydney-based brokerage.  </p>
<p>The bellwether stocks slid from A$17.99 on August 6 to end the week at A$16.99 after the surprise departure of three senior executives with investors and with investors questioning the company's direction. The company itself said on August 6 it was close to completing an evaluation of assets and its review of business performance.</p>
<p>Other corporate events remain thin on the ground.</p>
<p>Monday and Friday are clear of major profit results at this stage but those currently known are as follows.</p>
<p>    Tuesday   - PMP Communications annual results</p>
<p>Wednesday - WMC annual results  </p>
<p>		  - Commonwwealth Bank annual results</p>
<p>Thursday  - Leighton Holdings annual results</p>
<p>		  - Lend Lease Corporation annual results</p>
<p>		  - Colonial Ltd annual results</p>
