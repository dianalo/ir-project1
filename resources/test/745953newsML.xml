<p>Idaho Power Co said Tuesday a boost in its second quarter revenues was largely offset by higher expenses.</p>
<p>The utility said it earned 52 cents a share in the latest quarter, compared with 56 cents in the same 1996 quarter.</p>
<p>Idaho Power said favorable hydroelectric generating conditions allowed it to supply energy to all of its business customers and to sell energy off-system to other utilities. Higher revenues were also seen in its wholesale power trading operations.</p>
<p>"We have been saying for some time now that the profit margins in our business would begin to tighten," said Idaho Power Chief Executive Officer Joseph W. Marshall.</p>
<p>"Revenues are up and part of that is attributable to wholesale market sales which reflect lower margins than general business sales. We expect that trend to continue."</p>
<p>Other operating expenses were greater due to increased maintenance at the utility's hydro and thermal power generating facilities; additional customer service and energy trading personnel; start-up costs of the marketing business unit; and increased wheeling and consulting expenses.</p>
<p>Idaho Power said it established a reserve for possible rate refunds to customers in accordance with the 1995 Idaho Regulatory Settlement which provides for a sharing with customers of over an 11.75 percent rate of return on year-end common equity.</p>
