<p>Rebels on the advance in eastern Zaire will leave mining concessions untouched in the areas they control, provided the mining companies pay taxes to the rebel administration, a rebel commander said.</p>
<p>The rebels will also try to open up new areas to mining, especially in the central region of Kasai, rebel officer Jean Kabongo told Reuters on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>"All diamond mines and operations, like De Beers in Mbuji-Mayi, will remain in the hands of the companies who have been running them and operating the franchises up until now.</p>
<p>"This is their job. We will change the taxation system in as much as legitimate taxes and permission money are given to us rather than the Zairean government. We will not interfere as long as they continue to respect our regulations," he said.</p>
<p>"In Kasai, more diamonds must be mined, the country's mineral wealth exploited. We are going to try and throw the area open for government-sponsored mining licences in areas in Kasaai that have not yet been explored," he added.</p>
<p>The rebels say that on their southern front they have already captured the mining centre of Kamituga, where the South Africa-based company Anglo-American Corp has been operating.</p>
