<p>The 12-year-old girl playing the title role in the upcoming Broadway revival of the musical "Annie" has been fired just weeks before opening night and replaced by her understudy.</p>
<p>According to press reports, Joanna Pacitti was fired four weeks before opening night because the producers found her acting wooden and they have replaced her with an 8-year-old understudy.</p>
<p>Pacitti, chosen after a highly publicised search last year and who has played the title role in previews around the country, was in tears during an interview with ABC's "Turning Point" programme aired Thursday night.</p>
<p>"I just don't want this to happen to anybody else, to any other little girl because I know it's hard to get through and it breaks your heart and mine is split in half right now," she said.</p>
<p>Before breaking into tears, she added, "It's not gonna' be me coming down the stairs in my Annie dress and my red wig."</p>
<p>But she added, "I am a lot like Annie 'cause I keep my chin up and that's what I am doing right now. I'm trying to keep my chin up. .. It's really heartbreaking. I just gotta' try and remember that I'm the real Annie and the sun will come out tomorrow."</p>
<p>Meanwhile a lawyer retained by her family says they are thinking of suing on the grounds she won a contest to be Annie and they can not take the prize from her.</p>
<p>The 20th anniversary production of the hit musical based on the life and times of the cartoon character "Little Orphan Annie" will also star Nell Carter in the role that won a Tony award for Dorothy Loudon in the original production.</p>
