<p>The dollar dug in just below a six-year high against the flagging mark in early European trade on Friday, with traders wondering if it had the impetus to go even higher.</p>
<p>The continued strength of the U.S. currency, which made a brief sally above 1.84 marks, gave the German and French share markets further support.</p>
<p>Germany's blue chip exporters particularly relish the strong dollar because it makes it easier for them to sell their big-ticket goods.</p>
<p>Currency dealers said the apparent tolerance of Germany's Bundesbank to the weak mark and the lack of support from the central bank's council meeting on Thursday continued to support the dollar.</p>
<p>The dollar was also higher against the Swiss franc, climbing above 1.51 to reach its peak since August 1993.</p>
<p>Dealers said the move was mainly technical, boosted by the dollar's rise above key resistance in the 1.4900-30 francs area on Thursday and options-related hedging above the 1.50 level.</p>
<p>	 The press statement after Thursday's Bundesbank council</p>
<p>meeting, its last before the four-week summer recess, said the central bank was paying attention to developments in the mark and financial markets.</p>
<p>"This was pretty bland so it was not hard to take dollar/mark higher," said a U.S. bank dealer. "But we've had more Buba comments since then which is giving people something to chew on into the weekend."</p>
<p>The dollar stood at 1.8340 at 1000 GMT after touching a fresh six-year high earlier of 1.8403. It stood at 1.8315 late Thursday in Europe.</p>
<p>The mark was slightly firmer from earlier levels against other European currencies and managed to recover some of its recent losses against the Swiss franc.</p>
<p>Against the yen, the dollar eased back from its earlier, near one-month highs but was still holding well above 116 in morning trade.</p>
<p>In the share markets, London's FTSE 100 started Friday's session higher as a squeeze in selected stocks continued, taking the overall market ahead, dealers said.</p>
<p>But the early advance soon ran out of steam, and a 15 point gain had become a 25 point loss by 1000 GMT as traders squared their positions ahead of a flood of major results.</p>
<p>The mood in Frankfurt was more bullish with shares underpinned by the dollar's strength, though prices could not build on their early gains.</p>
<p>Dealers were hard pushed to come up with a forecast for the market, though trade was expected to be somewhat quieter after the heady surges earlier this week with resistance seen at 4,400 points.</p>
<p>"No one knows where this market is going at the moment. It's going up, it's going down, it's pretty unique at the moment and very volatile," a Frankfurt trader said.</p>
<p>The spectre of a possible interest rate rise haunted some market players, after the Bundesbank dropped a subtle hint to the markets that it could swing into action rapidly if a policy change were needed.</p>
<p>"If an interest rate rise comes, then the DAX is around 500 points too high," one edgy trader said, although another trader said these fears were exaggerated.</p>
<p>The banking sector was again centre of attention, with euphoria over the merger between Hypo-Bank and Vereinsbank earlier this week still lifting the banks.</p>
<p>First-half results on Thursday also helped underpin sentiment in the sector and Deutsche Bank AG AG was strongly ahead, up 3.78 pct at 123.50, while Commerzbank AG was up 2.20 marks at 65.20 marks, again boosted by merger speculation.</p>
<p>French stocks opened sharply higher however, bolstered by the dollar's rise to nearly 6.2 francs and a fresh record on Wall Street, which rose 28.57 points to 8,116.93, its third consecutive closing record.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 index rose over one percent in early trade, hitting an early high of 3,024.10, just shy of the 3,026.99 record, though it then fell back below 3,000 points.</p>
<p>Rhone-Poulenc SA shares were up 2.54 percent at 254.80 francs after the chemicals group reported a 20.2 percent rise in second-quarter net income. Brokers said the results were excellent.</p>
<p>PSA Peugeot Citroen was the top gainer, rising 3.55 percent to 671 francs, helped by recent recommendations on the French car sector. Brokers said Peugeot is catching up with Renault's recent rally.</p>
<p>LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton performed in line with the market even though Guinness and GrandMet flatly rejected its proposal for a three-way drinks merger.</p>
<p>"We're going to war," said one broker. But he said the market was confident in LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault, who is trying to line up enough support among GrandMet shareholders to stop the Guinness-GrandMet merger. CURRENCIES AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.8340 marks and 116.35 yen compared with 1.8295 marks and 115.85 yen in late trading on Thursday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1000 GMT</p>
<p>LONDON - The FTSE-100 index was down 25 points at 4837.9.</p>
<p>FRANKFURT - The DAX index was up  just 0.82 points at 4,336.56.</p>
<p>PARIS - The CAC-40 was up 21.82 points at 2,995.35.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was higher in early European trade at around $323.45 an ounce after closing in London at $322.65 on Thursday.</p>
