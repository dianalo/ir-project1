<p>A public transport workers strike that has crippled the Slovak capital Bratislava is politically motivated, Mayor Peter Kresanek said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The strike, which began on Tuesday and is ostensibly aimed at securing higher pay, has been condemned by opponents of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar who say the premier has deliberately underfunded the capital because it is run by the opposition Christian Democrats (KDH).</p>
<p>Kresanek, a member of KDH told independent radio Twist he agreed with the interpretation.</p>
<p>"If somebody puts a city such as Bratislava into a state of collapse, it is nothing other than a political move," he said.</p>
<p>City hall has slammed the strike as illegal and Kresanek said there was no more money for the strikers who are demanding 40 percent pay rises and longer holidays.</p>
<p>"We were receiving state subsidies of 760 million crowns ($22.8 million), fully covering transport, but since 1992 it's only 434 million; (this is) definitely not enough," Kresanek said.</p>
<p>The government has been cutting Bratislava's budget since 1992. Last year Meciar said he would like the capital to move to Banska Bystrica, central Slovakia, where he has stronger support than in traditionally western-oriented Bratislava.</p>
