<p>European Monetary Union (EMU) in 1997 may transform the world gold market, says a leading bullion analyst, Andy Smith at Union Bank of Switzerland. Smith said in interview comments on his latest published market analysis that EMU had focused central bank thinking on gold reserves as never before.</p>
<p>The market's concern is that gold could be sold to meet EMU entry criteria of a budget deficit of three percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and debt "diminishing and approaching" 60 percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Rumours of central banks sales have kept the gold market cowed for the past several months.</p>
<p>Trading during most of October was conducted to a background of fresh rumours that a European bank was a seller or that the ground was being prepared for an EMU-related sale.</p>
<p>Bullion prices have been confined to a narrow range between about $376 per ounce and $390 per ounce since late summer with the range tightening noticeably towards the lower end recently. "I am not recommending in any sense a sale. The damage (to the price) would be done just with sentiment," Smith said.</p>
<p>"The market thinks about these things and at the end if there is not a voice saying "we have your best interest at heart' -- which is unlikely  -- then the market will fear the worst and sell the rumour," he said.</p>
<p>Smith has estimated that, in theory, to reduce debt by only one percent of GDP, the main advocates of EMU -- Germany, France, Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, Ireland and Luxembourg -- would have to sell over 2,600 tonnes of gold between them.</p>
<p>Economic growth next year was the other key issue Smith highlighted as the countries move towards meeting criteria.</p>
<p>"If they undershoot on growth what contingency reserves could they use to still meet the budget criteria? Well one of the things is gold," he said.</p>
<p>"Creative accounting is what has been done so far," he said. With no growth miracle and no relaxing of criteria, "gold is there as a sort of back stop and the market knows it".</p>
<p>The preparation for EMU would keep the market in a state of maximised uncertainty for the next six to 12 months.</p>
<p>"Even if EMU came off the rails, they (the central bankers) will never see gold again as this passive asset just to be left alone," Smith said. "The thinking is going to be much more of a workaday asset that has to earn its keep."</p>
<p>"It's the most important thing to hit gold in a generation," Smith said, likening the EMU issue to U.S. President Richard Nixon removing gold backing for the dollar.</p>
<p>What that means for the gold price is far from certain but the market will know that whereas the central banks might not sell gold, they definitely will not be buyers which has "put the market on the back foot", Smith said.</p>
<p>Some possible sales would be fairly easily absorbed by the market, but it would be much harder for the late selling banks to complete a sale without disruption, Smith said.</p>
<p>Later sellers would have to sell more gold to realise their needs due to the price almost certainly falling.</p>
<p>"In terms of attitudes to gold, it moves gold forward from that twilight zone from commodity and money into a much more realistic view of the market by all the players," he said.</p>
<p>"Gold will have to earn its keep in whatever form mobilisation may take. But a decent working assumption is that at the end of this process, more gold being mobilised in terms of lending swapping, derivatives, and outright sales than before," Smith said.</p>
<p>"Where that leaves the price I don't know. But the thinking about gold will be moved on by this process. It will be much more clinical," he forecast.</p>
