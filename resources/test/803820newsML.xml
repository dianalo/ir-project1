<p>Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh plans to remove two controversial ministers and bring in a well-known businessman and a former finance minister in a cabinet reshuffle, media reported on Friday.</p>
<p>It was not immediately possible to confirm the reports, which were carried identically by most local print media.</p>
<p>The media quoted coalition sources as saying former finance minister Virabongse Ramangkura and telecom tycoon Thaksin Shinawatra were expected to become deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs and commerce minister, respectively.</p>
<p>The move appeared designed to bring more credible figures in to help handle the economy. Virabongse was involved in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during Thailand's last economic crisis in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Most other changes were among deputy ministers portfolios, newspapers said.</p>
<p>Deputy interior minister Chalerm Yoobamrung and education minister Sukhavit Rangsitphol, both considered controversial figures, were reported to be removed, although Sukhavit was expected to retain his deputy prime minister role.</p>
<p>Chavalit, under siege for his handling of Thailand's economic crisis, hinted at a reshuffle earlier in the week, but diplomats said they had expected even more sweeping changes.</p>
<p>Chavalit had an audience with King Bhumibol Adulyadej late on Thursday, sparking rumours that a reshuffle was imminent.</p>
