<p>Shenzhen International Holdings Ltd said it had agreed to buy a stake in Southern Glass Holdings Co Ltd from its parent Shenzhen Building Materials Industrial Group Co for HK$284.29 million.</p>
<p>Shenzhen International said it had agreed to buy from its parent Shenzhen Building the entire issue share capital of Shenzhen Yida Trading Corp, which holds 11.33 percent of Southern Glass.</p>
<p>The purchase will be settled by issue of 238.897 million new shares at HK$1.19 each to the parent, it said.</p>
<p>Upon completion, the parent's stake in Shenzhen International will be increased to 61.59 percent from 56.91 percent, the statement said.</p>
<p>Shenzhen-based Southern Glass engages in processing and sale of high quality glass products.</p>
<p>Opitcal products maker Shenzhen International said the purchase would increase the earnings base of the company.</p>
<p>The company also said it was in discussions with another third party for further acquisition of shares in Southern Glass so as to consolidate its control of the glass maker. It said it might issue further new shares to fund the proposed acquisition.  </p>
<p>Shenzhen International also said it was in discussions on four other investments, including setting up a joint venture with a Chinese partner for the production of concrete and related products in Shenzhen.</p>
<p>It said it was in talks to buy an 80 percent stake in Maoming Yinda Fine Chemicals Co Ltd for 45-50 million yuan, to buy a 38-kilometres toll road in China, and to issue new shares to fund its HK$40-50 million purchase of residential property in Shenzhen from its parent.</p>
<p>The company said the four proposals were still under negotiations.</p>
<p>Trading in the company shares, which was suspended on June 3, resumed on Wednesday. Its shares fell HK$0.10 or 5.85 percent to HK$1.61 in mid-morning.</p>
