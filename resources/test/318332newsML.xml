<p>The Sudanese rebel alliance said on Monday its forces had advanced close to the Blue Nile capital of Damazin, which supplies Khartoum with most of its power, after knocking out a government army detachment in the east.</p>
<p>Yassir Arman, spokesman for the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), said rebels from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) were 70 km (44 miles) outside Damazin and still advancing.</p>
<p>Arman said the rebels had advanced after wiping out a government detachment at Keili 100 km (60 miles) south of Damazin and killing more than 100 government troops.</p>
<p>"We are moving towards Damazin. Actually we are now 70 km outside Damazin," Arman told Reuters by telephone.</p>
<p>He added: "We are doing our best. Our plan is being executed successfully so far. We are confident of getting to Damazin."</p>
<p>There was no independent confirmation of the rebel claim.</p>
<p>Arman said the joint Sudanese opposition had seized several towns and 11 garrisons in the Blue Nile area but the government only admits to losing the towns of Kurmuk and Qeissan near the Ethiopian border.</p>
<p>The rebels say their goal is Damazin, site of a hydroelectricity plant which supplies Khartoum with 80 percent of its power, to put pressure on the Sudanese government and bring about a popular uprising.</p>
<p>The rebels have been fighting the government in the east of the country for a week but Sudanese officials have said that they are nothing but agents of Ethiopian and Eritrean forces, who they say are doing most of the fighting.</p>
<p>Both states have denied the charges and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has said that he is certain that no foreign troops have entered Sudan.</p>
<p>Egypt has also raised the morale of the Eritrea and Cairo-based opposition by saying that it would not intervene in the fighting, which it described as an internal affair.</p>
<p>Last week Mubarak met Sudanese Vice-President al-Zubeir Mohammad Saleh and he told a meeting of intellectuals on Saturday that Egypt would not offer support.</p>
<p>The mainly Christian and animist SPLA under veteran guerrilla leader, John Garang, has been fighting against domination by the Arabised Moslem north since 1983.</p>
<p>An SPLA alliance with exiled northern opposition groups has boosted its standing and strengthened its military arm after the group splintered into at least four factions in 1991.</p>
