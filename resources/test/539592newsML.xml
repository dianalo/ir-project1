<p>Former Indian election chief T.N. Seshan, who heralded a political clean-up campaign during his five-year term, on Friday announced he was running for president.</p>
<p>Seshan, who retired as Chief Election Commissioner last December, promised to give life to a largely ceremonial post.</p>
<p>"The national condition is such that I cannot bring myself to be a totally silent spectator. It is this which has prompted me to set forth as a candidate for the office of president of India," Seshan said in a statement.</p>
<p>Seshan, 64, told a news conference that administrative inefficiency and the emergence of coalition politics had made the office of president important.</p>
<p>The Indian president is voted to power indirectly by an electoral college of directly elected lawmakers in the federal parliament and state assemblies, by a system of proportional voting based on the population of various provinces.</p>
<p>President Shankar Dayal Sharma, whose term ends in July, is eligible to run for a second term.</p>
<p>The new president must be elected before July 24.</p>
<p>In a process where political parties call the shots, the chances of Seshan's success as an independent candidate were not expected to be high. But Seshan said he had been received well by 20 political leaders he had met in the past two days.</p>
<p>Seshan, who won the Philippines' Magsaysay award for his crusade against electoral violence and corruption in the world's most populous democracy, brought controversy to the election chief's job, earlier seen as a dull bureaucratic office.</p>
<p>During his term, Seshan confronted the independent civil service, fought Supreme Court cases and publicly criticised then prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.</p>
<p>Under the constitution, the president, who is the head of state, appoints the prime minister.</p>
<p>In a fragmented parliament, the president's elbow room for decisions on the formation of a government is increased.</p>
<p>India has seen four prime ministers, three of them heading coalitions in a hung parliament, since May 1996.</p>
