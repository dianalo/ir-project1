<p>HSBC James Capel said on Thursday it cut its full-year profit forecast for ICI after the chemicals group announced its third-quarter results.</p>
<p>"The markets have remained difficult for ICI in the third quarter," David Ingles, analyst at HSBC James Capel said.</p>
<p>Ingles said he cut his full-year forecast by 40 million stg to 640 million. The group earned 951 million stg in 1995.</p>
<p>ICI earlier on Thursday said pre-tax profits dropped to 131 million stg in the third quarter from 248 million a year earlier. Analysts had forecast pre-tax profits between 127 million stg and 140 million stg.  </p>
<p>ICI shares have fallen steadily in the last few weeks on a string of downgrades triggered by worries about price pressures in polyester and titanium dioxide markets.</p>
<p>But the stock recouped some recent losses on Thursday, gaining 20-1/2p to 796p on hopes for the company's cost-cutting programme and optimism ICI had come through its worst patch.</p>
