<p>Austrian building output will shrink 0.5 percent in real terms this year, hit by a sluggish housing market and slower-than-expected demand for renovations, semi-official economic research institute WIFO said on Friday.</p>
<p>"While the construction industry in much of western Europe picks up in 1997, output in Austria will be down in real terms," WIFO said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said a house-building boom that fizzled out in 1995 showed no signs of returning and demand for homes, particularly expensive homes, was in decline.</p>
<p>"It remains to be seen what impact the planned increase in public spending on infrastructure will have," WIFO continued. The government has promised to support infrastructure projects in a bid to tackle record unemployment.</p>
<p>WIFO said renovation and modernisation work was on the increase but noted growth had failed to match expectations.</p>
<p>The state statistical office has not yet published data on 1996 building output. -- Vienna newsroom, +43-1 531 12 254</p>
