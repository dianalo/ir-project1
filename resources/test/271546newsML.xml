<p>Former Argentina international Mario Kempes signed a two-year contract with Albanian first division club Lushnja to become the Balkan country's first foreign coach since World War II.</p>
<p>Lushnja President Pellumb Xhaferri told a news conference on Saturday that Kempes had agreed to a contract worth $350,000 for two seasons plus a monthly salary of $1,500.</p>
<p>Xhaferri said the club would also pay all of Kempes's expenses and accommodation costs, as well as rewarding him with $50,000 should Lushnja win the Albanian league championship or cup.</p>
<p>"I am very pleased with the way I have been received in Albania and hope to do well with Lushnja. Technically they have a lot of potential," said Kempes, whose goals helped Argentina win the 1978 World Cup.</p>
<p>Lushnja trail 10th in the league standings despite the signing of Brazilian players Carlos Eduardo Castro de Souza, nicknamed Edu, and Vlademir Souza dos Santos and Nigeria's Leonardo Ineh Nosa earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Xhaferri said he would welcome any suggestion from Kempes if other foreign players were required.</p>
