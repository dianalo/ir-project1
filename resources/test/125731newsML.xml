<p>The Polish garment maker Zaklady Przemyslu Odziezowego Elpo SA (Elpo), whose shares were approved for public trade on Friday, plans its initial public offering to begin late next month, the firm's president said.</p>
<p>Kazimierz Brzezinski told a news conference that 600,000 Elpo shares will be offered at 20 to 22 zlotys each in tranches for employees, large and small investors, joining the other 156,730 shares approved by the Polish Securities Commission.</p>
<p>"The price will be fixed (for all tranches) and will be set just before the issue," Brzezinski told the news conference, adding that Elpo, which specialises in denim clothes, sought a parallel-market listing.</p>
<p>The small-investor tranche of 270,000 shares and employee tranche of 80,000 shares will take place from November 25 to December 6, with the large-investor tranche following on December 12 and December 13.</p>
<p>Large investors will be able to register for 20,000 to 100,000 shares, with 500,000 shares needing to be sold overall for the issue to be valid.</p>
<p>Brzezinski said the funds would go toward buying new equipment including new washing facilities.</p>
<p>He said 350,500 shares would be underwritten by Powszechny Bank Gospodarczy SA for a stand-by fee of 2.5 percent and 150,000 at no charge, resulting in an average stand-by fee of 1.75 percent.</p>
<p>Elpo made a net profit of 0.4 million zlotys last year on 12.9 million zlotys in sales and earned 0.5 million zlotys on sales of 6.9 million zlotys over this year's first half.</p>
