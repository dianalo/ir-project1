<p>Russia and Japan signed on Monday an agreement for the first tranche of a $500 million loan that Japan originally pledged to Russia in October 1991, an Export-Import Bank of Japan official said.</p>
<p>The first tranche covers three projects worth about 10.6 billion yen, including a car painting facility, a medical centre and a babyfood factory, the bank official said.</p>
<p>The bank said a loan worth 7.14 billion yen will be provided for the car painting plant, to be operated by Russia's Izhmash Co.</p>
<p>Another loan worth 1.76 billion yen will be provided to establish a new medical centre in Irkutsk, Siberia.</p>
<p>An additional 1.67 billion yen will be loaned to the babyfood factory in Khabarovsk in Russia's far east, the bank said.</p>
<p>The bank spokesman said that several other schemes are also under study.</p>
<p>The $500-million loan was initially earmarked for use in humanitarian projects. The Russian government asked, however, that the loan also be applied to commercial projects, leading to the inclusion of the automobile painting project in Monday's agreement.</p>
<p>The agreement was signed by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, who is in Japan on a three-day visit with an 80-member delegation.</p>
<p>Nemtsov, who is also Russia's fuel and energy minister, said he is eager to attract more Japanese direct investment to Russia.</p>
