<p>The Canadian Auto Workers union was optimistic that a contract deal with Ford Motor Co. of Canada Ltd. could be reached on Tuesday after Ford made its economic offer late Monday.</p>
<p>A source close to the union said a deal could be announced Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>CAW President Buzz Hargrove was scheduled to update the media at 4 P.M. EST 2100 GMT.</p>
<p>Hargrove said late on Monday that Ford's offer appeared to include all the contract language in the pattern agreement forged recently with the Canadian units of Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp.</p>
<p>"We now have the pattern," said Hargrove. "We want to drive now to try to do this thing by (Tuesday)."</p>
<p>Ford Chief Negotiator Donald McKenzie said late Monday that work remained on settling local issues, but he voiced confidence a contract could be reached before the union's 7 P.M. EST 1400 GMT Wednesday strike deadline.</p>
<p>"I'm confident that having tabled this agreement and having matched the pattern, we can get there," said McKenzie.</p>
<p>Union negotiators, who represent about 11,700 Ford workers, were checking the offer's language and meeting with company negotiators to iron out several outstanding local concerns.</p>
<p>The two sides remained at odds over skilled trades and office work issues, as well as working conditions at Ford's truck and van assembly plant in Oakville, Ontario.</p>
<p>Hargrove said the local issues would not stand in the way of a deal.</p>
<p>"These are not unresolvable issues. These are not issues (McKenzie) is going to put the operation in the ditch over," said Hargrove.</p>
<p>The pattern deal offers the union protection from outsourcing, or contracting out jobs, ensures minimum health and safety and employment standards and gives workers improved benefits and a 10.2 percent wage and cost of living increase over three years.</p>
<p>Ford Canada is a wholly owned unit of Ford Motor Co.</p>
