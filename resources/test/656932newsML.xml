<p>Swiss police are on a heightened state of suicide cult watch ahead of the summer solstice on June 21 and are keeping a close eye on known members of the notorious Solar Temple sect, a senior justice official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Gerard Ramseyer, the top justice official in Geneva canton, said police was maintaining a "discreet surveillance" of 10 people in the international city "who may be exposed to risks" because of their links with the Solar Temple sect.</p>
<p>Since 1994, mass suicides have claimed the lives of a total of 74 followers, and family members, of the bewildering sect which believes "death voyages" by ritualised suicide lead to rebirth in a place called "Sirius".</p>
<p>"We're continuing our surveillance and we're checking if these people are still here and making sure that the children are still here," Ramseyer told reporters. "But we cannot stop people taking their own lives."</p>
<p>Two of the 10 people under surveillance are children, Ramseyer said but gave no details.</p>
<p>Ramseyer said police believed there were some 100 people in Switzerland who were formerly close to or had been members of Solar Temple. The followers are mostly well-off professionals who are taught the world will end in fire and that to reach the afterworld they must die by burning.</p>
<p>He was speaking after a news conference where authorities from the cantons of Geneva, Vaud, Neuchatel, Tissin and Fribourg announced plans to boost cooperation in monitoring sects.</p>
<p>Geneva police fear the summer solstice is a "delicate time of the year" for the suicide cult's followers, said Ramseyer.</p>
<p>The last suicides of Solar Temple were in March when five believers, two of them Swiss, killed themselves in Quebec, Canada.</p>
<p>The cult won international notoriety after mass suicides aand murders killed 53 of its members in two Swiss villages in the Swiss cantons of Fribourg and Valais and a ski resort in Quebec in 1994.</p>
<p>A year later, in December 1995, 16 cult members including several children died in a remote French Alpine forest clearing in a macabre ritual in which most of them were drugged and had plastic bags pulled over their heads before being shot.</p>
<p>Those killings coincided with the winter solstice on December 21.</p>
