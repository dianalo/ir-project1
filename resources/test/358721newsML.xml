<title>NEW ZEALAND: Greenpeace says Antarctic ice shelf may collapse.</title>

<p>The environmental group Greenpeace said on Wednesday it had filmed large cracks in an Antarctic ice shelf which suggested the collapse of the shelf was imminent.</p>
<p>Greenpeace said cracks in the Larsen B shelf were further evidence that global warming may be affecting the Antarctic.</p>
<p>"Scientists blamed recent warming of the Antarctic Peninsula region after the 4,200 square km (2,625 mile) northerly part of the Larsen Ice Shelf, known as Larsen A, collapsed suddenly in January 1995," Greenpeace said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The rapid disintegration of this and other ice shelves around the Antarctic Peninsula is considered by some scientists as a sign that dangerous warming is beginning in Antarctica."</p>
<p>Greenpeace said that during the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula climate had warmed by 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.5 degrees Fahrenheit), which it said was the fastest rate of warming observed anywhere in the world.</p>
<p>Greenpeace ship MV Arctic Sunrise is in the Antarctic Peninsula region for a month to document signs of climate change.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the vessel successfully circumnavigated James Ross Island, a passage previously impossible due to the Larsen A 200 metre (660 foot) thick ice shelf that joined the island to the Antarctic continent until 1995.</p>
<p>"It has taken centuries to millennia for these ice shelves to form and in a few short decades they are crumbling," Greenpeace said.</p>
<p>About 140 countries have ratified the 1992 Climate Change Convention committing them to stabilising emissions of gases believed to cause global warming, a phenomenon linked to disruptions and changes in weather patterns, and rising sea levels.</p>
