<p>CSCE cocoa futures ended sharply higher in light turnover on Monday, as a late-session round of speculative and local short-covering drove values up some $30 a tonne across-the-board, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said the rally was mainly technically driven, with upward momentum accelerating after the benchmark September contract broke through key chart resistance at $1,699-$1,701 a tonne, activating buy-stops and attracting new fund buying.</p>
<p>The run-up was led by the September contract, which rallied to a peak of $1,720, before trade selling shaved gains. At the close, September cocoa stood a $1,713, up $33 on the day. Spot July jumped $36, to $1,684, while the back months rose $30 to $31.</p>
<p>Cocoa prices headed lower at the opening, after a weak performance in London overnight. The downslide picked up after September slipped through nearby support at $1,672-$1,670, triggering light sell-stops and driving the most-active contract to a session low of $1,665.</p>
<p>Traders said New York futures followed a reversal in London, where operators focused on book-squaring ahead of July's first tender on Tuesday. LIFFE September ended up seven stg, to 1,151 stg.</p>
<p>Additionally, continued reports of an El Nino weather pattern, which some forecasters predicted could be the worst in 50 years, provided underlying support as traders worried about its impact on cocoa-growing areas.</p>
<p>Fears have emerged that recent dry weather in Indonesia -- the world's third-largest producer of cocoa -- are related to the weather phenomenon, and concerns have cropped up that top-producer Ivory Coast could also be affected. However, heavy rains during June in the Ivory Coast have boosted prospects for the 1997/98 main cocoa crop, Ivorian crop analysts said.</p>
<p>"Scattered talk of El Nino has been resurfacing," said Dean Witter analyst Corey Bell. "Also, there's the fact of July first tender in London and some concerns about what the delivery situation will be."</p>
<p>Traders said today's strong showing was bullish technically and likely to attract more buying on Tuesday. On the charts, they pegged September near-term resistance at last Thursday's high of $1,722, followed by its life-of-contract high of $1,737.</p>
<p>Volume was light, at an estimated 6,740 lots.</p>
