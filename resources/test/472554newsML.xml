<p>DHL will make more use of European sub-hubs due to the rapid expansion of its Brussels headquarters, a DHL spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>"It is our strategy to create more sub-hubs to avoid everything coming in through Brussels," he added.</p>
<p>DHL is experiencing average growth of 20-25 percent a year at Brussels, although February saw a 35 percent rise over 1996 levels.</p>
<p>Last year, the operator handled 155,000 tonnes in 1996 at Brussels representing 36 million consignments, he added.</p>
<p>DHL's existing European hubs are at East Midlands in the UK, Amsterdam, London, Paris, Madrid, Nuremberg, Vitoria, Brussels, Frankfurt, Cologne, Copenhagen and Bergamo. It also looking for a hub on the French-Swiss border.</p>
<p>This follows last year's decision not to operate a Rhine valley sub-hub at Strasbourg after environmental objections by local inhabitants and politicians.</p>
<p>The spokesman said although there is capacity to expand in Belgium, DHL is also keen to make more use of the regional hub system.</p>
<p>"For instance it is not efficient for shipments that are being sent within Scandinavia to travel all the way to Brussels to be sent back there, therefore we have a sub-hub in Copenhagen." - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax:5017</p>
