<p>UK biopharmaceutical firm Xenova Group Plc said on Thursday that it would invest a major portion of the proceeds of its share placing in developing its two lead drugs.</p>
<p>Louis Nisbet, chief executive of Xenova, said it would invest between 15 to 18 million stg on the Phase II stage of research on its anti-cancer drug XR 5000 and its multi drug resistance blocker XR 9051.</p>
<p>The company said it had raised 22.6 million stg on Thursday by issuing more than 10 million shares at 215p, giving it a market capitalisation of 50 million stg.  </p>
<p>Trading in the shares is due to start on the London Stock Exchange on December 19.</p>
<p>Currently, the company's major source of revenue comes from major drug firms which use Xenova's "discovery technology," Nisbet said.</p>
<p>Warner-Lambert Co, Genentech Inc and Suntory are already Xenova's partners.</p>
<p>Genentech has an eight percent stake in the company which would drop to four percent after the listing.</p>
<p>Zeneca Plc is investing two million stg through a subscription for 930,000 shares or 4.37 percent of the firm's equity.</p>
<p>"Zeneca will help us in research on natural products," Nisbet told Reuters.</p>
