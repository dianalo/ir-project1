<p>South Africa expects its current account to improve in the second half of the year and has no plans to seek International Monetary Fund (IMF) assistance, officials said on Monday.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Trevor Manuel said the country's recent success in tapping the international bond market, despite this year's sharp fall in the rand on investor jitters, showed South Africa could stand on its own feet.</p>
<p>"It's not as though we are knocking on the door of the Fund or the Bank with a begging bowl," Manuel told a news conference ahead of the 1996 IMF/World Bank meetings which start this week.</p>
<p>Reserve Bank Governor Chris Stals said South Africa did not envisage applying for an IMF standby facility since the country did not now require balance of payments support.</p>
<p>It had reserves to help bridge the current account deficit, plus over 15 billion rand ($3.3 billion) of unused credit facilities, Stals told the same news conference.</p>
<p>"That second line of defence (credit facilities) is still available before we come to the third line of defence which would be the IMF," Stals said.</p>
<p>A number of factors suggested improvement in the current account from now on, including a slowdown in gross domestic expenditure, restrictive monetary policy, the expectation that bank credit extension will decline and the likely effects of the depreciation of the rand.</p>
<p>"We believe that the current account deficit will decline in the second half of this year...so far we have not seen very convincing statistics, but we still believe that the current account deficit will get smaller over the next 12 months," Stals said.</p>
<p>Worries about South Africa's balance of payments position, and a decline in official reserves to just one month's import cover, have exacerbated concerns about the rand. It has fallen since February from 3.65 against the dollar to 4.51.</p>
<p>The deficit on the current account for the balance of payments ballooned to 6.9 billion rand in the first half of 1996, after 12.7 billion for the whole of 1995 and 2.2 billion for all of 1994.</p>
<p>But Manuel said the reception for South Africa's 500 million mark Eurobond launched this month showed international investors still had faith. The finance department hopes to follow with a U.S. "Yankee" bond next month and will be holding a roadshow for potential investors in the United States from October 4 to 11.</p>
<p>Manuel said South Africa had also been holding preliminary talks on a possible World Bank loan to help its industries compete more effectively.</p>
<p>A topic at the IMF talks of particular interest to South Africa, a major gold producer, is the IMF plan to sell five million ounces of bullion to aid poor countries. South Africa has discouraged the IMF from selling the gold, which represents some five percent of IMF reserves of gold.</p>
<p>But Stals said he was sympathetic to helping the poorest states and sales would not unduly disrupt the market if they were gradual.</p>
<p>Manuel, Stals and other officials head first to Bermuda for the September 24-26 Commonwealth finance ministers' meeting before attending the IMF/World Bank talks.</p>
<p>Manuel said he was keen to compare notes with Commonwealth counterparts, including India, which is seeking to implement a budget-cutting plan similar to that unveiled by Manuel in June.</p>
