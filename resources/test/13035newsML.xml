<p>Portuguese champions Porto kicked off the season with a disappointing 2-2 home draw against Setubal and were lucky to squeeze in an equaliser in extra time.</p>
<p>Porto, who are fighting to take their third consecutive title this season, were 2-0 down until the 86th minute when a header by Mario Jardel found the net after a string of missed opportunities, including a penalty taken by top league scorer Domingos Oliveira in the 60th minute.</p>
<p>Domingos redeemed himself by netting the equaliser just into extra time.</p>
<p>Setubal, who put on a skilful counter-attack throughout the game, opened the scoring 16 minutes into the match when an unmarked Chiquinho Conde shot around Porto's new Polish keeper Andrejez Wozniak. Conde scored his second in the 70th minute.</p>
<p>Benfica, also playing their first game of the season at home, were held to a 1-1 draw by northern side Braga despite the fact that the visitors were reduced to 10 men in the 54th minute after Rodrigo Carneiro was sent off for a second bookable offence.</p>
<p>Benfica dominated the game but their lack of a first-class striker was apparent throughout and in the 30th minute they lost key Brazilian midfielder Valdo who suffered a light knee injury. He was substituted by Paulao.</p>
<p>Benfica finally opened the scoring in the 81st minute with a penalty taken by Helder after Luis Baltasar tripped up captain Joao Pinto under the referee's nose.</p>
<p>Braga defender Idalecio gave his team their equaliser seven minutes from the final whistle with a header into the back of the net.</p>
