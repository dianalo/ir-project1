<headline>UK's FTSE ends firmer after stalking Dow upwards.</headline>

<p>London's FTSE 100 share index ended higher on Thursday after creeping tentatively upwards in the wake of a rejuvenated Dow, but fears of another reversal on Wall Street capped the FTSE's gains and kept volume subdued.</p>
<p>The blue-chip index ended 20.9 points higher at 4,228.4. Analysts said the gain had been inspired by the Dow, which climbed 83 points on Wednesday and was up a further 23 as London closed, but the FTSE remained reluctant to get carried away.</p>
<p>"The Dow has been incredibly volatile," said Credit Lyonnais Laing strategist Savvas Savouri. "The intraday movement has been so violent recently there's no discernable trend to follow."</p>
