<p>England's hopes of staging the 2006 World Cup finals were boosted on Thursday when UEFA were forced to back down in a row over their support for Germany.</p>
<p>UEFA President Lennart Johannson said while European soccer's governing body would not break a "gentleman's agreement" they have had with Germany since 1993, they accepted England's bid would be decided upon along with Germany's by democratic process in due course.</p>
<p>"I am delighted with what has happened today," said English Football Association (F.A.) chief executive Graham Kelly who, together with German officials, met UEFA representatives to discuss the confusion surrounding the two bids.</p>
<p>The confusion arose because the Germans believed they would be the only European country bidding to stage the finals and that a non-minuted "Gentleman's agreement" dating from 1993 would guarantee that situation.</p>
<p>English officials say they were never party to that and they had always intended to bid for the finals in the event of staging Euro 96 successfully.</p>
<p>Franz Beckenbauer, the former West German captain and coach who is now spearheading Germany's bid, was disappointed with the outcome of Thursday meetings.</p>
<p>The German F.A. always believed England would not stand in the way of a German bid.</p>
<p>"I believe the situation we now find ourselves in will divide the European bid and could be an advantage to a third country," Beckenbauer said.</p>
<p>A decision on who eventually hosts the finals will be taken by the executive committee of FIFA, world soccer's governing body, in three years time.</p>
<p>South Africa, Brazil, Argentina, Egypt and Morocco have already expressed an early interest in staging them.</p>
