<p>European Commission president Jacques Santer was quoted on Sunday as saying that proposals were under way for a harmonisation of EU taxation systems.</p>
<p>He told the Sunday Times in an interview that the proposals would cover VAT and some taxes on savings. He denied suggestions that they would include income tax or social security.</p>
<p>"If the internal market is to function properly then there must be some rapprochement in our taxation systems, especially in the VAT system," Santer said.</p>
<p>"This harmonisation is not a precondition to reach the single currency, it is a question of how can we achieve the internal market in the best way," The Sunday Times quoted Santer as saying.</p>
<p>He said the proposals were expected to be published in the next few months.</p>
<p>Santer said the European Commission was looking at ways of closer harmonisation of taxes on savings in order to combat competition for bank deposits between some member states. Any such moves would be co-ordinated with the OECD.</p>
<p>He said the commission was cautious about acting on income tax or social security rates because of respect for national sovereignty.</p>
<p>But he did not rule out attempts to bring income tax rates closer as a possible future goal.</p>
<p>"We have to see what will be the effect of the Euro," he said.</p>
<p>Santer reiterated that he was "quite confident" there would be a significant number of countries joining the European single currency on January 1 1999.</p>
<p>"There is never a good time to introduce a single currency...But we have never had such convergent policies in the economic fundamentals, inflation rate , interest rate and so on and I see no reason to delay the timetable,"' he said.</p>
