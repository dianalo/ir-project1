<p>NWE fuel oil prices treaded water on Thursday in thin business with little to move the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>High sulphur barges drifted down a little to trade at $81, $81.50 and $82 fob ARA. Traders said there was stubborn resistance to going lower, with $81 a strong barrier and $80 unlikely to be breached imminently.</p>
<p>"It's a boring market but it does look as if its bottoming out," said one barge trader.</p>
<p>Strong prices for fuel oil in Asia were supportive of demand in Rotterdam, traders said.</p>
<p>Rumours continued that material would move out of the Mediterranean to Asia, with opinions differing on whether the arbitrage window was open wide enough to justify the transit.</p>
<p>A German trader was heard to have bought 50kt of end-April barrels from Italy at either high quotes plus 25 cents or $1, to take to the Far East.</p>
<p>High sulphur buyers in Europe saw movement to Asia as mildly supportive of price in the short term but were still calling bearish numbers.  </p>
<p>Utilities were holding down bids with the $75 cif number floated on Wednesday still in the market with few firm numbers heard from sellers.</p>
<p>Low sulphur cracked was little discussed, though a small requirement into Denmark was heard filled with poor quality high density material at $89.25 delivered. Supply, though tighter, was considered still good given weak demand. - London newsroom +44 171 542 8060</p>
