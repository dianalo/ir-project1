<p>Metris Cos Inc President Ronald Zebeck said Monday he is comfortable with the current mean earnings estimate for 1997 of $1.65 a share.</p>
<p>"I believe we're right on track...We feel very comfortable with those numbers," Zebeck said after the shareholders' meeting here Monday.  </p>
<p>The First Call mean estimate for 1997 of $1.65 a share is a 42 percent increase over the $1.16 a share earned in 1996.</p>
<p>"The fact that we're servicing a segment the traditional (credit card) issuers are not competing in gives us a good feeling that we can go and grow at 42 percent levels very well," Zebeck said.</p>
<p>Metris, a consumer credit company, targets households with annual earnings of $15,000 to $35,000, which it says represents almost one third of total U.S. households.  </p>
<p>Zebeck said he expects Metris would have a 36 to 50 percent increase in the number of credit card accounts in 1997 compared with 1.4 million accounts at the end of 1996.  He also expects a 63 percent increase in account balances in 1997 compared with $1.6 billion at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>"They (analysts) are looking for us to grow about 500,000 to 700,000 new accounts (in 1997), and I'm comfortable with those numbers," Zebeck said.  "If we can grow by a billion dollars in outstandings (accounts receivable), I'd be very pleased."</p>
<p>Zebeck said he expected Metris' net charge-off ratio, or net charge offs expressed as a percentage of average loans outstanding, to increase to 10.5 percent in 1997 from 6.7 percent in 1996.</p>
