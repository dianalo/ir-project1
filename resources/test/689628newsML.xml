<p>U.S. grain analysts expect the U.S. Department Agriculture to show a slight decline in its next soybean acreage forecast, and most see corn acreage higher because of favorable spring planting weather.</p>
<p>"We could see less beans in the Northern Plains and some increase in corn acres," said Jerry Gidel, analyst with Dean Witter in Chicago. "The weather didn't dry out in time to let them plant beans in the north."  </p>
<p>Some Northern Plains farmers were unable to return to flooded fields until mid- to late May, which is too late to plant soybeans in that area, Gidel said.</p>
<p>The USDA will release its first acreage report based on farmer surveys at 0730 CDT/1230 GMT on Monday.</p>
<p>In its last report in March, the government estimated soybean acreage at 68.8 million acres and corn acreage was forecast at 81.4 million acres.</p>
<p>Analysts' estimates for the upcoming acreage forecast ranged from 67.3 million to 69.5 million acres for soybeans and corn acreage estimates ranged from 81.2 to 82.1 million acres.  </p>
<p>Favorable weather this spring will likely mean that farmers planted more corn than they had intended to earlier in the growing season, analysts said.</p>
<p>"In Illinois, farmers planted more corn because of favorable weather," said Steve Freed, grain analyst with ADM Investor Services.</p>
<p>U.S. farmers, with the memory of last year's late, soggy planting season still fresh in their memories, seized the opportunity to get their corn in the ground early this year, analysts said.</p>
<p>In contrast to those looking for soybean acreage to fall, some analysts expect world oilseed demand to push the soybean acreage figure higher than the government's previous estimate.</p>
<p>"I'm going with history," said Anne Frick, oilseed analyst with Prudential Securities in New York. "In previous demand bull years, we have had an increase in July plantings relative to spring intentions."</p>
<p>Areas where the number of soybean acres could expand include U.S. Delta states and in wheat-growing areas, Frick said.</p>
<p>Cotton farmers, unhappy with the last crop's prices were seen switching from cotton to soybeans and some wheat farmers in areas where wheat was damaged by a late spring freeze, could have planted soybeans, analysts said.</p>
