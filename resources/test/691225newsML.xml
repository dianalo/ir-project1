<p>Syria, Egypt and six Gulf Arab states ended talks in the Syrian resort of Latakia on Thursday by agreeing to set up a common market among the eight countries.</p>
<p>A communique issued by ministers of the so-called Damascus Declaration grouping said they had assigned a committee to meet before September to prepare measures for establishing the market.</p>
<p>The ministers also expressed deep concern over Turkish-Israeli military and security cooperation, which "constitutes a threat to the security of Arab countries and to stability in the Middle East", the communique said.</p>
<p>They "called on Turkey, a member of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, to reconsider its cooperation pact with Israel and to return to the ties of good neighbourliness and cooperation with Arab countries, to preserve the mutual interests and the historical links between the two sides".</p>
<p>The ministers also "jointly rejected attempts by the Israeli government to avoid its commitment to withdraw fully from the Golan (Heights) to the June 4, 1967 (pre-war) boundaries".</p>
<p>In an indirect reference to Qatar's plans to hold a Middle East and North Africa economic summit in September, the communique stressed the need for Arab countries to abide by resolutions adopted by the Arab League in March regarding normalisation with Israel and regional cooperation.</p>
<p>Qatar has said it would go ahead with the meeting because it had a commitment to the countries participating, despite criticism from several Arab countries, mainly Syria.</p>
<p>Qatar's foreign minister did not attend the Latakia meeting but sent his deputy.</p>
<p>Along with Syria and Egypt, the Damascus Declaration grouping includes the countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, whose country is the largest oil exporter, said the kingdom supported establishment of a common market among the eight states.</p>
<p>"The kingdom calls for cooperation among Arab states, especially in the economic field, and we support the establishment of this market. We will discuss with an open heart and mind this issue," he said.</p>
<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, also speaking to reporters before the meeting, said the ministers would discuss how to increase cooperation by forming a common market or establishing free trade zones.</p>
<p>"The common market was discussed by the Arab summit held in Cairo last year and the Arab League promoted the idea. The Syrian-Egyptian higher committee supported the idea during its meeting held in Cairo recently," he said.</p>
