<p>Spanish security forces are bracing for violence during a strike and demonstrations in the major Basque cities on Friday, organised by the political arm of the ETA separatist (corrects from "terrorist") group.</p>
<p>The last such protests, on February 15, deteriorated into a violent clash between thousands of demonstrators and police who at one point fired live bullets into a crowd, wounding two people.</p>
<p>Spain's Basque police ordered a tripling of street forces on Thursday to counter threats against schools and businesses by the group, Herri Batasuna (HB).</p>
<p>Education officials in the northern region denounced letters sent by HB to headmasters, teachers and students, warning them to stay away from classes during Friday's strike.</p>
<p>"As a preventitive measure, the Ertzainza (Basque police) will triple its ordinary numbers," Basque regional government Deputy Interior Minister Jose Martiarena told reporters.</p>
<p>Police aim to keep roads clear, guarantee functioning of public transport, prevent picketing and keep strike organisers from filling shop keyholes with silicone to stop businesses opening.</p>
<p>HB called the strike to protest at the imprisonment of most of its leadership in recent weeks. Eighteen of the 25-member HB leadership have been jailed for failing to answer a Supreme Court summons to appear on charges of distributing an illegal pro-ETA video during Spain's 1996 election campaign.</p>
<p>The Basque government has outlawed the strike, saying it is politically motiviated.</p>
<p>The prospect of trouble has exacerbated tensions in the region, already running high since ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom) stepped up its attacks this year, killing six people including a Supreme Court judge.</p>
<p>Basque businessmen complained earlier in the week that HB had sent threatening letters warning them to heed the strike call or pay the consequences.</p>
<p>"This strike can only succeed by means of fear because the majority is against it," Basque Interior Ministry spokesman Juan Ramon Ruiz said on Thursday.</p>
<p>An estimated 10 to 15 percent of Basques support HB.</p>
