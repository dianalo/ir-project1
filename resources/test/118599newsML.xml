<p>Japanese exporters expect the dollar to take a breather from its recent rises, although the trend of a stronger dollar should continue in the long run, exporters and dealers said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The dollar lacks the energy to break above 112 yen and further into the 113 yen level," said Akira Shimura, foreign exchange manager at electronics giant Toshiba Corp.</p>
<p>Although exporters said the gap between higher U.S. interest rates and lower Japanese rates has supported the greenback, that was not enough to propel it higher.</p>
<p>"A dollar at 113 yen or 114 yen won't come easily," added Tsukasa Wada, general manager at trading house Seiko Corp.</p>
<p>Reflecting such views, exporters have shown selling interest near 112 yen recently, currency dealers said.</p>
<p>"Exporters have placed offers from 111.80 yen on up to 112.30 yen," said Hank Note, chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank.</p>
<p>Toshiba's Shimura said: "Our policy is to sell the dollar whenever it hits a new high."</p>
<p>The dollar rose to a 33-month high of 112.10 yen on October 2, but has been mostly capped below 112 yen since.</p>
<p>It was standing at 111.94 yen in late Tokyo afternoon trade.</p>
<p>The failure to pierce the 112 yen barrier again has in turn made exporters intent on selling near that level, they said.</p>
<p>"Under the present circumstances, 112 yen would be a good target to sell," said Seiko's Wada.</p>
<p>Dealers also said exporter sales in forward contracts may pick up speed once the dollar clears the 112 yen hurdle, slowing down any sharp rises.</p>
<p>Under the current conditions, exporters would be able to sell dollars for their end-March book closings at 110 yen through forward contracts should it rise above 112.30 yen, as the spread between the greenback's spot and five-month forward rates presently stands at around 2.30 yen.</p>
<p>Most exporters are expected to reap in profits if they are able to sell dollars at 110 yen for the fiscal year.</p>
<p>"If the dollar should rise above 112 yen, we would start selling dollars through forwards," said Kazutada Ieda, director of accounting and finance at Sega Enterprises Ltd.</p>
<p>Ieda said the game machine maker would aim to sell dollars above 111 yen, the rate it used for calculating its half-year book closings.</p>
<p>Sega would be able to achieve that goal through one-month forwards if the dollar strengthens to around 112.40 yen, as the one-month spread now stands at around 1.40 yen.</p>
<p>But both dealers and exporters said they saw little chance of a significant dollar dip and added that they were in no hurry to sell dollars.</p>
<p>"Exporters' offers are scattered and in very small volumes," said Sumitomo's Note.</p>
<p>Seiko's Wada also said the likelihood of a dollar fall below 110 yen was equally slim as that of a rise to 113 yen, adding the watchmaker has not made any forward contracts at the moment to sell dollars.</p>
<p>Toshiba's Shimura said although the dollar will face sales at key resistance points such as 112 yen, exporter sales would not be enough to deter it from its course of gradual strengthening.</p>
<p>"The rise would be gradual, pausing from time to time on exporter sales, but steady," he said.</p>
