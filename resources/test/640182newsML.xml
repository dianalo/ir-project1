<p>U.S. Treasury bond futures Thursday retained a constructive tone heading into Friday's U.S. employment report for May, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>"Over the last couple of days, the market keeps knocking its head against some really good resistance at the top of the range it has been in since early May," said David Ging, analyst for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.</p>
<p>The ability of September bond futures to remain buoyant at levels just below the May 13 high of 110-09 demonstrates there is a good underlying bid to prices, Ging and other analysts said.  </p>
<p>"It shows the market is in a bullish mood going into the number," Ging said. "If we get a friendly number, you'd expect an upside breakout."</p>
<p>Economists in a Reuters poll were looking for May non-farm payroll growth of 219,000 and a 0.1 point gain in the unemployment rate to 5.0 percent.</p>
<p>The uncertainty associated with the monthly number kept gains in check and trading hushed Thursday. September bond futures inched to a high of 110-03 before settling 1/32 lower at 110-00.  </p>
<p>"Today summed up the last three weeks. We haven't had enough trend-setting news to break out of the range," said Donald Pullen, bond floor analyst for E.D. and F. Man.</p>
<p>Unless non-farm payrolls come in stronger than expected, bond futures are poised to test the 111 16/32-24/32 area on an upside breakout, Ging said.</p>
<p>Bullish seasonal factors in June and daily and long-term momentum indicators that are still trending higher bolster the case for more price gains, he said.  </p>
<p>Gerry DeMers, technical analyst for Fuji Securities, said he also looked for futures to remain in an uptrend, based on an ongoing pattern of impulsive thrusts higher followed by choppy, corrective downmoves.</p>
<p>In addition, September bonds continue to trade above support based on Gann angles sloping down from the previous highs of 113-09 and 115-17, he said.</p>
<p>"Nothing here short term looks like a deviation of that pattern," DeMers said.  </p>
<p>But the analysts said an unexpectedly strong jobs number could push September bond futures back into its trading range and toward the low 108-00 handle.</p>
<p>If the data are neutral, "we'll be doing a lot of what we are doing now, moving back and forth," Pullen said.</p>
