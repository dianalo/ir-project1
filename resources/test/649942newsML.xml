<p>More than half of the seriously injured people who go for treatment at trauma centres across the United States may be abusing alcohol or other drugs, a study said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The estimate was based on a study of more than 1,000 seriously injured patients at the University of Maryland's Cowley Shock Trauma Centre in Baltimore, a facility described as typical of other such centres across the country in terms of the patients it receives.</p>
<p>Researchers at the centre said more than 54 percent of the seriously injured patients treated had a psychoactive substance abuse disorder or had previously been diagnosed with one. Psychoactive substances include alcohol and other drugs.</p>
<p>"Our data suggest that seriously injured trauma centre patients manifest more severe forms of addiction than the general population ..." the report, published in this week's Journal of the American Medical Association, said.</p>
<p>The injuries included both accidents and "intentional" injuries such a gunshot wounds. The authors of the study suggested that trauma centres routinely test or screen for drug or alcohol use and refer patients for help.</p>
