<headline>LISBON SHARES DOWN, OUTPERFORM OTHER EUROPEANS.</headline>
<text>
<p>1640 GMT - Shares closed lower as major European centres retreated sharply lower and Wall Street remained highly volatile. Traders said that the outlook for Thursday depended on how New York closed.</p>
<p>*Total turnover was 13 billion escudos. The PSI  .PSI20 index ended 0.55 percent down at 8,212.39. The fall was less than that seen in Madrid, Paris or Frankfurt.</p>
<p>*Attention will be focused on the U.S. inflation figures due to be released on Thursday after better than predicted producer price and retail sales numbers failed to dispel totally concerns about a U.S. rate rise.</p>
<p>*On the local front, there was heavy trade in Banco Mello  BMEN.IN, apparently due to some portfolio shuffling and not fresh business, and Inparsa.</p>
<p>*Traders had no particular explanation for the strength of the industrial and media holding except that it will be the vehicle for Sonae group chairman Belmiro de Azevedo's bid for Portugal's third mobile phone licence.</p>
<p>*The overall weakness of Wednesday was also influenced by the softness of the dollar and the strengthening of the German mark after the Bundesbank indicated that rates could have to rise if inflation quickened.</p>
