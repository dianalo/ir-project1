<p>Brazil's Alagoas state is not expected to be able to pay off 109.3 million reais in securities which came due Monday because of a lack of funds, a spokesman for the Central Bank in Brasilia said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Alagoas, an impoverished state in the northeast known for its feudal politics and chaotic finances, had requested authorization to roll over the bonds but that this had not yet been given.</p>
<p>"Alagoas sent a request to the Senate for permission to roll over the debt but the Central Bank, which has to prepare reports on these requests, has been unable to do so because the state failed to provide the necessary documentation," he said.</p>
<p>The spokesman added that the bonds were originally issued to pay for court-ordered debts but there was a suspicion that the moneys were used for other purposes.</p>
<p>Following a multi-million-dollar scandal involving these types of securities, the Senate recently decided that bonds misused for running costs when they should have paid legal debts could not be rolled over.</p>
<p>Asked if Alagoas was expected to default, the Central bank spokesman said, "Well, where else are they going to get the money from?"</p>
<p>Alagoas, a frontier state where electoral campaigns consist as much of gun fights as they do of posters and rallies, is one of several Brazilian states which came under the spotlight during the recent municipal bond scandal.</p>
<p>Senators investigating the scam say officials sold state and city debt at below market prices to friendly brokerages who sold them on at considerable profits. The illicit gains are believed to have made their way to overseas bank accounts.</p>
<p>In addition to the dubious profits involved, some of the states were accused of misusing the funds for purposes other than to pay court-ordered debts.</p>
<p>The Central Bank said Alagoas was not alone in default. The city of Osasco in Sao Paulo state also failed to pay up 29.1 million reais in securities that came due Monday.</p>
