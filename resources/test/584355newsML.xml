<p>The Western Australian Government will amend the state's Stamp Act "to address a potential avenue of stamp duty avoidance", Finance Minister Max Evans said.</p>
<p>Evans said the proposed amendments will target artificial schemes which result in the acquisition of company shares without the payment of stamp duty by utilising, in part, the conversion of ordinary shares to redeemable preference shares.</p>
<p>"Schemes of this type could potentially be used in takeover situations to avoid the payment of stamp duty, a situation the government clearly can not tolerate, given the limited revenue base available to the states," Evans said.</p>
<p>According to a report in Wednesday's West Australian newspaper the legislative move was "prompted by knowledge that such a scheme might be in the offing".</p>
<p>A ministerial spokesman told Reuters on Wednesday: "There was a case we knew of that could have cost the state A$2 million (in lost revenue)."</p>
<p>In his original announcement Evans said the Government will seek to amend the Stamp Act with effect from May 12.</p>
<p>"To limit the extent of uncertainty which may exist as a result of this announcement the Government will also be seeking swiftly to introduce the relevant legislation into Parliament," Evans said.</p>
