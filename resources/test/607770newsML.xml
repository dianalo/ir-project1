<p>Austrian opposition parties said on Thursday they are boycotting parliament to force the government to call an inquiry into the Vienna murders of three Kurdish activists by suspected Iranian assassins.</p>
<p>The opposition Greens, Liberals and far-right Freedom Party announced at an unprecedented joint news conference that they would block proceedings until June 10.</p>
<p>"We have overcome all our ideological differences to agree to this emergency measure," deputy Freedom Party whip Ewald Stadler told reporters.</p>
<p>"We have taken a very difficult decision. We are countering an extraordinary situation with our own extreme measures," added Liberal whip Hans Peter Haselsteiner.</p>
<p>The parties are demanding formation of an all-party parliamentary committee to examine allegations that ministers bowed to pressure from Iran after the slaying in July 1989 of Iranian Kurdish leader Abdorrahman Qasemlu and two associates.</p>
<p>Warrants for the suspected Iranian hitmen were  issued only after they had already fled the country.</p>
<p>Former Iranian president Abolhassan Bani-Sadr and a former senior Austrian diplomat have backed the opposition claims.</p>
<p>The opposition bloc, which holds 60 seats in the 183-seat assembly, has already made four unsuccessful attempts to persuade the government to launch an inquiry.</p>
<p>Each time they were voted down by the ruling coalition of Social Democrats led by Chancellor Viktor Klima and the conservative People's Party of Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel, which has been in power for more than a decade.</p>
<p>Government ministers responded angrily to the boycott and accused the opposition of undermining democracy.</p>
<p>"It is up to the parliamentary majority to decide who is right. We cannot allow a group with less than one third of the seats to force parliament's hand," said People's Party whip Andreas Khol.</p>
