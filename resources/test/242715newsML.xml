<headline>NY precious metals end mixed on low volume.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-09</dateline>

<p>New York precious metals futures ended mixed on low volumes Monday, but sentiment remained bearish, despite four days of consolidation following last month's slide.</p>
<p>"We see potential for gold prices to erode toward the $360 area near-term, as well as limited likelihood for a sustained recovery without a significant shift in sentiment toward both pending supply pressure and financial assets," Smith Barney analyst David Rinehimer said.</p>
<p>COMEX February gold closed down $1.10 at $369.70, after trading down to $369.60.  </p>
<p>Total estimated COMEX gold futures volume was only modest at 15,000 lots.</p>
<p>Spot gold in the bullion market was quoted $367.90/368.30, compared to the London Monday afternoon fix at $369.00, and the New York close Friday around $369.00.</p>
<p>Spot gold saw a three year low last week at $366.00.</p>
<p>The spot gold/silver ratio was little changed around 77.12, but has declined from 80 in the past month, as gold has more supply shock potential, analysts said.</p>
<p>COMEX March silver closed up 0.2 cent at $4.807 an ounce, after trading down to $4.780.</p>
<p>"The path of least resistance for gold prices is likely to remain to the downside unless significant price corrections occur in financial and or foreign exchange markets or anticipated selling from producers and central banks does not materialize," Rinehimer said.</p>
<p>Despite Friday's corrections in world stock and bond markets, this year's gains in equity and debt markets have kept investment demand low in precious metals markets, analysts said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up about 25 pct for 1996.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the strength of the U.S. dollar is restraining demand for gold in Asia in particular.</p>
<p>Japan, the third largest gold consumer behind India and the U.S., imported only 115 tonnes of gold in the first 10 months of 1996, down some 50 pct on the year ago period.</p>
<p>But silver imports to Japan remained healthy at 182 tonnes in October, compared with 147 in September and 52 tonnes a year ago. For the first 10 months of 1996, Japanese silver imports totalled 1,053 tonnes, up 7 pct on the year-ago period.</p>
<p>Funds remain at near record net short levels in COMEX gold futures, according to the CFTC Commitment of Traders data for the week ended December 3, released Friday night.</p>
<p>"Non-commercials" held net short positions of 53,975 lots in gold, but funds were only net short 1,273 lots in silver.</p>
<p>But the Philadelphia Stock Exchange gold and silver equities sector index and related options was higher Monday, helped by news of a buyout of Santa Fe Pacific Gold by Homestake Mining, topping Newmont Mining's bid for Santa Fe last week.</p>
<p>The XAU index was up 0.13 points at 121.72 near the close. The index is often seen as a leading indicator for spot gold and silver prices.</p>
<p>Platinum group metals were also mixed with COMEX January platinum seeing a fresh contract low at $370.00, before closing down $2.60 at $370.20.</p>
<p>Earlier platinum fixed at a fresh three year low at $368.00 in London Monday morning.</p>
<p>The April gold/April platinum spread fell sharply, closing at just 30 cents an ounce from $2.00 Friday. The spread saw a recent high at $9.40 an ounce on November 21.</p>
<p>While Russian spot market selling was rumored, analysts noted South African production and exports have been rising in recent months, while Japanese demand has been soft.</p>
<p>South Africa produced 16.8 tonnes of platinum group metals in September 1996, against 14.8 tonnes in August, while exports rose to 19.0 tonnes in September from 12.8 tonnes in August, according to the South African Department of Mineral and Energy Affairs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, October platinum imports by Japan, the world's largest consumer, slipped to 5.1 tonnes from 5.5 tonnes in September and 6.9 tonnes in October last year.</p>
<p>For the first 10 months of 1996, Japanese imports totalled 54.8 tonnes compared to 55.9 tonnes in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>NYMEX March palladium closed up $1.65 an ounce though at $119.25.</p>
