<p>Shares in LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton fell sharply on Tuesday, underperforming a weak market, after its Duty Free Shoppers subsidiary failed to win the contract for two concessions at the new Chep Lap Kok airport in Hong Kong, brokers said.</p>
<p>The stock was down 3.29 percent at 1,439 francs at 1030 GMT, while the CAC-40 index was 1.3 percent lower.</p>
<p>One broker said the concessions were among the largest in the world. Brokers said LVMH's shares were also undermined by the dollar's volatility.</p>
