<p>Two English rugby clubs, one league and one union, have made history by merging.</p>
<p>Harrogate Rugby League Club and Knaresborough Rugby Union Club from the northern county of Yorkshire have come together to benefit from pooled resources both in terms of players, who can play both codes, and facilities.</p>
<p>"It's a world first of the kind," former Rugby League chief David Oxley, who is president of the Harrogate Club, said on Wednesday.</p>
