<p>VF Corp said Tuesday it intends to invest $1.25 billion in its brands over the next four years.</p>
<p>The company also said it plans to invest $150 million in a new organizational structure designed to free up resources for the brand investments.</p>
<p>The company's statement made no reference to job cuts which a Wall Street Journal report said the restructuring would cause. A VF spokeswoman said she had no knowledge of any upcoming job cuts.  </p>
<p>Stating the program is designed to create $2 billion in new annual sales by 2000, she said this would result in the creation of jobs.</p>
<p>Stating the brand investment is based on strategies put into motion last year, chief executive Mackey J. McDonald said, "We will make an unprecedented push behind our strongest product categories -- jeanswear, intimate apparel, workwear and daypacks -- to spur renewed growth in sales.</p>
<p>"Over the next four years, we intend to invest a total of $1.25 billion behind our brands, including $250 million" in consumer research, product development and marketing.  </p>
<p>"That strategy, which we call 'consumerization', ... is also the driving force behind our move to a new, more efficient organizational structure, one that is designed to keep our brands closer to consumers and free up resources for our brand investments."</p>
<p>McDonald said the "new" VF will consist of five coalitions -- North and South American Jeanswear, Intimate Apparel, Knitwear, Playwear and International -- each of which supports a number of marketing companies.  </p>
<p>"Over the next several years, we will consolidate within these coalitions much of the manufacturing and administrative functions now duplicated across 17 separate divisions, a monumental task given the breadth and diversity of our operations," McDonald said.</p>
<p>"As part of this move, a newly established Service Center has been created in Greensboro, North Carolina to centralize information systems and transaction processing for all our domestic operations."</p>
<p>To accomplish this reorganization will require investment of about $150 million over the next several years.</p>
<p>"However, by the time we've finished, we expect to realize ongoing, annual savings of at least this magnitude," he said.</p>
