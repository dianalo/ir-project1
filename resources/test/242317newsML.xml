<p>One of the plane's engines had caught fire shortly after take-off. The cause of the fire was still unknown.</p>
<p>Antara said 13 of the 15 passengers were killed immediately and a 12-year-old girl died on her way to hospital. The pilot and co-pilot were also killed and one factory worker died on the ground.</p>
<p>One surviving passenger and three other factory workers were in hospital in serious condition.</p>
<p>The plane had taken off from Banjarmasin's Syamsuddin Noor airport on Saturday at 3:23 p.m. local (1123 GMT), for Sampit in Central Kalimantan on Borneo island in overcast weather conditions and drizzle.</p>
