<p>Rebels control the only roads into the vast east Zairean refugee camp of Mugunga, which is still believed to hold up to 400,000 Rwandan Hutus, an aid agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>With a lake on one side of the camp and volcanic mountains on the other, control of the only roads east and west of Mugunga suggests the Tutsi-dominated rebels have cut the camp off completely.</p>
<p>The reports came from a Zairean aid driver who, according to the American Refugee Committee (ARC), drove east from Sake on the Zairean side of the frontline and encountered a rebel checkpoint before reaching Mugunga camp. He then continued on to rebel-held Goma city at the weekend.</p>
<p>The driver, who did not want to be named, had been forced by Zairean troops to flee west from Goma before the town fell to the rebels nearly two weeks ago, along with some 15,000 other Zairean residents of the town, an ARC spokesman said.</p>
<p>By the time he left Sake at the weekend, it seemed the ill-disciplined Zairean troops had lost interest in fighting, and the area was in practice run by a local militia group that did not stop him leaving.</p>
<p>He headed east on the lakeside road and encountered a rebel checkpoint about one km (mile) west of Mugunga, a camp analysts fear could be the scene of a violent showdown between the rebels and the Hutu Interahamwe militiamen inside.</p>
<p>The ARC-run hospital is still working there. The driver, who was allowed into the camp and later out again towards Goma, said there had been no mass exodus westwards by refugees, the ARC's Michael Vjecha told Reuters.</p>
<p>The driver reported no fighting around the camp.</p>
<p>The rebels, backed by Rwanda, want refugees in the camp to return to nearby Rwanda, which they fled in 1994 after the Interahamwe massacred up to a million minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a three-month genocide.</p>
<p>Rwanda says the returnees will be safe but most seem to fear reprisals for the genocide. The Interahamwe know that years in jail, if not a death sentence, awaits them.</p>
<p>Although the driver was allowed to go to Goma, it is unclear if Hutu refugees from the camp would be allowed to follow suit even if they wanted to.</p>
<p>Many analysts believe the Interahamwe would stop refugees leaving, keeping them as a "human shield" or a bargaining chip to help them avoid capture.</p>
<p>Rwanda and the rebels hope that food and other aid supplies they are letting into Goma, some 15 km (10 miles) from Mugunga, will eventually tempt increasingly desperate refugees out.</p>
