<p>A plan to cut transmission capacity on the Pacific Intertie to 6,300 megawatts (MW), compared with the current limit of 7,200 MW, was submitted to the Western Systems Coordinating Council (WSCC) Tuesday, a spokeswoman for the reliability council said.</p>
<p>The interim rate will be effective July 1, pending final approval by the WSCC board, which is expected on or prior to July 1, she added.</p>
<p>The study group convened by the WSCC has not yet formulated a "summer" operating plan for the intertie since additional system studies are needed, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The interim rate represents a combined maximum for the AC and DC segments of the intertie. Separately, the AC line will have an interim limit of 3,450 MW while the DC line will be capped at 3,100 MW.</p>
