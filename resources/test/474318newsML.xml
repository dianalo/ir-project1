<p>The U.S. agriculture attache in Ivory Coast raised the forecast for the country's 1996-97 cocoa crop to 1.10 million tonnes, the U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA) said on Friday.</p>
<p>The attache in Jakarta raised the forecast for Indonesian cocoa production to 325,000 tonnes, the USDA said in a circular on tropical products.</p>
<p>The forecast for Brazil's 1996-97 production was unchanged at 198,000 tonnes.  </p>
<p>The USDA said the Ivory Coast forecast was raised from an earlier 1.05 million tonnes because of improved prospects for the mid-crop. The main crop again was forecast at 900,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>The forecast for exports of cocoa and cocoa products in 1996-97 was raised to 1.21 million tonnes from 1.08 million tonnes because of higher carryover from last season.</p>
<p>Indonesia's forecast was raised 16 percent from a previous estimate of 280,000 tonnes because of an increase in bearing trees and a larger-than-expected expansion in cocoa area. USDA also raised its estimate of the 1995-96 crop to 305,000 tonnes from previous 275,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Indonesian exports of cocoa and cocoa products in 1996-97 were forecast at 288,500 tonnes for Indonesia, including about 230,000 tonnes of cocoa beans.</p>
<p>Brazil was forecast to import 2,600 tonnes of cocoa and cocoa products in the 1996-97 season, which began October 1.</p>
