<p>A class of high blood pressure drugs known to cause birth defects when used by pregnant women may pose little risk to newborns if taken during the first few months of pregnancy, federal health officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>A study of 48 infants in the United States, Canada and Israel born to women who had taken angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors during the first 14 weeks of pregnancy found no evidence of kidney problems, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said.</p>
<p>The CDC said the study did not provide sufficient data to conclude that exposure to ACE inhibitors early in pregnancy was without risk but offered reassurance for pregnant women who stop taking the drugs in the early stages of pregnancy.</p>
<p>"A lot of women may become pregnant while they're taking this drug and may not know early on that they are pregnant," CDC epidemiologist Dr. Richard Olney said. "This provides reassuring data for women who discontinue it up until 14 weeeks."</p>
<p>ACE inhibitors were used to treat hypertension during pregnancy until there was mounting evidence that they caused women to give birth to infants with kidney problems and other birth defects such as face or skull deformities.</p>
<p>In 1992, the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) began warning that other hypertension medications should be used during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Of the infants studied, none had evidence of skull defects or retarded growth. One suffered a blood vessel defect sometimes caused by ACE inihibitors but Olney said it was "unlikely" that the drug caused the condition because the mother had stopped taking the drug less than two months into her pregnancy.</p>
