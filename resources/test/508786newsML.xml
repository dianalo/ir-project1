<p>Caledonia Mining Corp said on Tuesday its joint venture partner, BHP Minerals Canada Ltd, has completed a till sampling campaign over 80 percent of the Dunvegan property in the Northwest Territories.</p>
<p>"BHP has reported that the kimberlitic indicator mineral trains found on the Dunvegan property are not likely to have originated from the Lac De Gras area, and that the mineral chemistry suggests a diamondiferous source," Caledonia said in a statement. The Dunvegan property is located 30 kilometers west of the Lac de Gras project operated by Broken Hill Proprietary Co Ltd and Dia Met Minerals Ltd.  </p>
<p>"For 1997, BHP has planned an exploration program consisting of in-fill till sampling in areas with anomalous indicator minerals, regional till sampling over the newly acquired ground, airborne geophysical surveys, and drilling, if warranted," the statement said.</p>
<p>BHP has spent US$460,000 to date and can earn a 51 percent stake in the Dunvegan property if it invests a further US$1.04 million over the next two years, Caledonia said.</p>
