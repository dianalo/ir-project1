<p>Peace efforts in Northern Ireland suffered a new blow on Tuesday when London acknowledged that pro-British politicians were set to block proposals on how guerrilla groups should hand in their arms.</p>
<p>At the same time another pro-British political party announced it was quitting multi-party talks on the future of the province.</p>
<p>Ian Paisley, firebrand Protestant leader, said after meeting Prime Minister Tony Blair at his Downing Street office that the talks in Belfast were "dead in the water".</p>
<p>Paisley's party planned to walk out after a vote on "decommissioning" guerrilla arms was held at multi-party peace talks in Belfast on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The government has been consulting Protestant unionist politicians from Northern Ireland, angered by the terms of a weekend ceasefire by Irish Republican Army (IRA) guerrillas who have been fighting British rule for 28 years. The ceasefire was intended to secure a seat at peace talks in September.</p>
<p>Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said she had not given up hope of a positive vote on Wednesday, but added: "It is becoming less clear, and more likely that there won't be an agreement tomorrow afternoon."</p>
<p>The main party representing the province's Protestant majority, the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), made clear that it would oppose the government's arms decommissioning plans on Wednesday but would not walk out of the talks.</p>
<p>Ken Maginnis, the UUP's security affairs spokesman, said: "My undestanding is that there has been no immediate breakthrough and on that basis it is certain that we will be voting down the government's paper.</p>
<p>"However it would be the Ulster Unionist Party's intention to maintain its link both with Downing Street and with the political process. It is not our way to abdicate our responsibility to the electorate."</p>
<p>The unionists oppose allowing spokesmen from Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, into the talks without any firm commitment from the guerrillas to hand in their guns and explosives.</p>
<p>Participants in the peace talks vote on Wednesday on an Anglo-Irish proposal that decommissioning of guerrilla arms should be tackled by a subcommittee in parallel with political negotiations.</p>
<p>Political sources said that if the government lost the vote, talks could continue either on a bilateral basis between factions, or as "proximity" talks in separate rooms.</p>
<p>Despite the expected rebuff on Wednesday, Mowlam said the government remained committed to a September 15 target for the start of substantive peace talks, as opposed to negotiations about how they should proceed.</p>
<p>Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams urged Protestant unionist parties to stay at the conference table and join Sinn Fein in trying to bridge the deep gulf between them.</p>
<p>"What are they afraid of? Can they not have the courage of their convictions and sit down with their neighbours, their fellow citizens, to try to work out a resolution of these difficulties?"</p>
<p>Sinn Fein, which convinced the IRA it was worth calling a ceasefire, says the handing over of weapons should be part of a final settlement, not negotiations.</p>
<p>Paisley told reporters after meeting Blair that admitting Sinn Fein to the talks was an "act of betrayal".</p>
<p>Paisley's party is the second largest representing Protestants in Northern Ireland. A smaller party, the UK Unionists, withdrew from the talks on Monday.</p>
<p>Paisley denounced Blair's government for its readiness to negotiate with "IRA/Sinn Fein terrorists".</p>
<p>Paisley's stance drew fire from the political wings of banned Protestant pro-British "loyalist" guerrilla groups, who accused him of running away from talks.</p>
<p>The last IRA ceasefire, declared in August 1994, was broken 17 months later when the guerrillas exploded a huge bomb in London's Docklands area, killing two people.</p>
