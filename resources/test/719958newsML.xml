<p>Women's specialty retailer AnnTaylor Stores Corp said Thursday its second quarter earnings would not meet expectations set by Wall Street analysts due to a sales shortfall in June.</p>
<p>"However, assuming the company maintains flat comparable store sales in the fall season, earnings per share for the full year are expected to meet analysts' current consensus earnings estimates of approximately $1.00 per share," it said in a statement.</p>
<p>First Call's consensus among analysts foresaw a profit of $0.17 a share for the second quarter against a profit of $0.03 for the same period last year.  The consensus also forecast a profit of $1.01 for the year against $0.53 last year.</p>
<p>An AnnTaylor official said the company will release its results on August 19.</p>
<p>The company said in the same statement that comparable store sales for the five-week period ended July 5 fell 5.8 percent compared with the same period last year due to "fashion misses and inventory levels that were lower than planned."  Its stock was trading at 16-1/4 in Thursday morning trade, down 2-5/8 from the previous day's close on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
