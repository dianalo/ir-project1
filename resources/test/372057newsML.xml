<p>Tajikistan's fragile government moved on Wednesday to fulfil the demands of a rebel group holding several foreign hostages by sending helicopters to bring back 40 fellow fighters from neighbouring Afghanistan.</p>
<p>"Helicopters were sent to northern Afghanistan this morning," Zafar Saidov, spokesman for Tajik President Imomali Rakhmonov, told Reuters in the Tajik capital Dushanbe.</p>
<p>But he added the return flight had been delayed for "technical reasons".</p>
<p>Saidov did not say whether the fighters would be allowed to come back with their weapons.</p>
<p>The Tajik government said on Tuesday it would bow to the demands of the hostage-takers by allowing the return of fellow rebels to the ex-Soviet republic.</p>
<p>The hostage crisis began early last week when the rebels, led by Bakhrom Sadirov who once fought for the country's Islamist opposition, seized four United Nations military observers.</p>
<p>They later captured a carload of Russian reporters, two Red Cross workers and four employees of the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR.</p>
<p>The crisis worsened on Saturday when the rebels seized Tajik Security Minister Saidamir Zukharov who had flown in to negotiate with the hostage-takers.</p>
<p>They have released so far only three of the hostages -- the two Red Cross workers last week and one U.N. military observer, an Austrian national, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The government has said daily that it is close to a resolution of the crisis.</p>
<p>But tensions rose on Tuesday when Sadirov accused Dushanbe of playing a "dirty political game" by encircling his forces and refusing to create a corridor of safe passage for his fellow rebels on the Afghan border.</p>
<p>Sadirov's brother, Tajik rebel leader Rizvon Sadirov, returned home from Afghanistan on Monday to help negotiate the release of the hostages. Rizvon Sadirov is now reported to be at his brother's base near the town of Obigarm in a mountainous area 80 km (50 miles) east of Dushanbe.</p>
<p>The hostage crisis comes just as the government and Islamist opposition rebels are trying to end a bitter four-year civil war that has left tens of thousands dead and many more homeless.</p>
<p>But a ceasefire agreed at a meeting in northern Afghanistan last December appears to be holding.</p>
