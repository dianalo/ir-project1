<p>U.S. spot gasoline and heating oil prices were stable in ACCESS trade late Tuesday after release of weekly API inventory data deemed slightly bearish by traders.</p>
<p>In earlier NYMEX trade, heat futures fell 0.91 cent and gasoline futures slid 1.26 cents in a reversal of two days of sharply higher prices, traders said.</p>
<p>The API data, for the week ended August 16, showed a seasonal 1.83-million-barrel increase in distillate inventories on the heels of several weeks of drawdowns and scanty builds.</p>
<p>Total distillate stocks stand at 106 million barrels, almost 18 million lower than the comparable period last year, the report said.</p>
<p>It showed a seasonal gasoline draw of 864,000 barrels, putting stocks 1.4 million below last year's levels. But the data showed a bearish 2.2 million build in reformulated gasoline stocks in New York Harbor.</p>
<p>"I'd call the numbers a little on the bearish side," one Gulf Coast trader said. "Gasoline is only a million or so barrels less than last year, so it's slowly building back to normal."</p>
