<p>With political uncertainty and economic travails roiling Russia, Richard Hisey, who helped start the Lexington Troika Dialog Russia mutual fund, warns that the fund is not for the risk-averse investor.</p>
<p>"We want the sophisticated investor with a long-term view," he said.  "This would definitely be a risky portion of anybody's portfolio. We don't recommend it as a core holding."</p>
<p>But Hisey is also comfortable with the characterization that the $35 million fund, which started last July, is the least risky among risky funds.  </p>
<p>"We designed this fund for U.S. investors to be able to participate in the overall growth of the Russian economy," Hisey said.  "We're pretty bullish about the long-term prospects in Russia."</p>
<p>Lexington, the first U.S. open-end devoted to Russian securities, has much of its portfolio invested in such monopolistic industries as oil and gas, utilities and telecommunications, Hisey noted.</p>
<p>About 29 percent of the fund is in oil and gas, 24 percent in telecommunications and 22 percent in utilities.  </p>
<p>Despite concern over President Boris Yeltsin's health and pressures on the local economy, Hisey, who last visited Russia in October, said the fund's overall view on the country is "relatively positive compared to the past year."</p>
<p>Hisey said the country has a "constitutional overdependence" on the presidency.  "(Boris) Yeltsin's double pneumonia was a blessing in disguise," he said, "giving a wakeup call to reformers in government, that they really have to knuckle down on a plan for some kind of succession to Yeltsin."  </p>
<p>Hisey described the emerging economy as "incredibly stable" over the past few months, with inflation running at an annualized rate of 22 percent, compared with 2,000 percent about five years ago.</p>
<p>The current tax code poses a risk to both the economy and investors, he said.  "The lack of a rational code hinders further investment," he said.</p>
<p>He asserted that the general Russian populace is "increasingly happy...most of the prosperity is in the cities," but beginning to trickle down to the villages, with such signs as increased construction.  </p>
<p>While heavily weighted in the fund, oil and gas stocks are underweight compared with the Russian Trading System Index. "Oil and gas has a lot of upside potential," he said.</p>
<p>The top holding is Unified Energy Systems, a utility, at 6.5 percent. The second biggest issue in its portfolio -- at 5.8 percent -- is five-year Russian Eurobonds yielding 9-1/4 percent, third is Surgutneftegaz at 4.8 percent, fourth is Moscow Telephone Systems, the local phone carrier, at 4.8 percent, and Rostelekom, the long distance monopoly in Russia, at 4.3 percent.  Excluding the Eurobonds, cash is more than 10 percent of the portfolio, Hisey said.  </p>
<p>According to Lipper Analytical Services, the fund has returned 55.34 percent year to date, compared with an average 12.99 percent for emerging market funds.</p>
<p>Since its inception last July, the fund has returned 48.21 percent.  According to Lipper, the fund is rated number one among all equity funds.</p>
