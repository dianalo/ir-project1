<p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised right-wing supporters on Thursday that Jewish settlers would never be forced to leave the West Bank town of Hebron.</p>
<p>"The Jewish community in Hebron will not be uprooted -- not now, not tomorrow, never," he said in a speech to members of the National Relgious Party, a key partner in his coalition government.</p>
<p>Around 400 Jewish settlers live among 100,000 Palestinians in Hebron, the last of seven West Bank towns Israel's previous Labour-led government promised a year ago to hand over for Palestinian self-rule.</p>
<p>Under a landmark 1993 Israel-PLO interim deal, the future of Hebron settlers and 130,000 other Jews living in the West Bank and Gaza -- which Israel captured in the 1967 war -- will be determined in talks on a final peace agreement to be reached by 1999.</p>
<p>Netanyhau opposed the 1993 deal that launched Palestinian self-rule but has vowed to withdraw troops from parts of Hebron once Palestinians agree to modifications aimed at better safeguarding settlers in the town.</p>
<p>The two sides have failed in four weeks of intensive talks to agree on terms for the withdrawal.</p>
<p>Israel has accused Palestinian President Yasser Arafat of stalling to rally international pressure against Israel. Palestinians say Israel wants to renege on its commitments.</p>
<p>More than two million Palestinians live in the West Bank and Gaza where the PLO hopes to establish an independent state.</p>
