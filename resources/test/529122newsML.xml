<p>LONDON, April 22 (London) - A further decline in London Metal Exchange (LME) aluminium inventories helped to lift prices during Tuesday trading, though traders and analysts were unsure if the buoyancy would continue.</p>
<p>The draw of 4,700 tonnes, the latest in a string of declines, highlighted the recent nearby physical and consumer demand, traders said.</p>
<p>Currently metal held in LME warehouses stands at 818,300 tonnes down around 15.5 percent from a January 1997 peak of around 968,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>When International Primary Aluminium Institute (IPAI) stocks of 3.077 million tonnes are taken into consideration overall inventories equate to around 6-1/2 weeks of global consumption.</p>
<p>Traders noted most of the recent movement of aluminium metal, used extensively in transport, packaging and building industries, was from UK warehouses. Little found its way into LME warehouses globally.</p>
<p>Several traders suggested that metal was being  shipped to the U.S. and the Far East as consumers restocked.</p>
<p>"Traders are reporting interest in small tonnage to China," brokers GNI said. GNI along with other market players said that the tightness in China was due to Russian grades moving to the U.S. rather than the Asian market.</p>
<p>Angus MacMillan, analyst at brokers Billiton Metals, said the movement of material to the U.S. may reflect first quarter restocking by fabricators.</p>
<p>Historically the first two quarters of any given year sees brisk demand for all base metals, which can spark declines in global stock levels.</p>
<p>But as summer approaches Northern hemisphere demand for primary aluminium drops as factories close for holidays and maintenance while production continues to flow.</p>
<p>MacMillan suggested that the market would move into "rough balance" in the second half of 1997. "Aluminium's outlook has not been improved by rumours that a number of producers on both sides of the Atlantic have been buying more petroleum coke than they require to maintain output at current levels."</p>
<p>"The implications are clearly that they may be about to restart potlines mothballed as part of the MOU agreement," he said.</p>
<p>The MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) was a loose pact between major producing countries to restrict output in order to cut a huge surplus of the metal that built up in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Recently there has been market talk that major producer Alcan is making moves to restart the idled third potline at its Sebree smelter, although there was no confirmation.</p>
<p>This comes against the backdrop of high Russian production and exports which are showing few signs of abating, traders said.</p>
<p>In late morning trading three months delivery aluminium was trading around $1,580 a tonne, up $20 from Monday's close.</p>
