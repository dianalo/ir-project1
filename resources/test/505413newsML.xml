<p>A Greek Orthodox Church official on Sunday accused the Islamic religious authority of breaking into the Patriarchate in Arab East Jerusalem and taking over two rooms.</p>
<p>The official said if the Patriarchate and the Islamic Waqf failed to resolve their disputes bilaterally, the Patriarchate would ask for arbitration by Israel.</p>
<p>Islamic Waqf officials said they opposed the intervention of the Israeli occupation authorities in the dispute.</p>
<p>"During renovation on a mosque and areas around it by the Islamic Waqf, workers broke a wall between the Moslem area and the Patriarchate last week and entered two rooms of the Patriarchate," said Metropolitan Timothy, Patriarchate secretary.</p>
<p>"They took over the two rooms and moved everything in those rooms to another room and also broke the doors," Timothy told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Patriarchate is located near the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in the walled Old City of Jerusalem, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.</p>
<p>Timothy said the Patriarchate owned the rooms "for centuries and this is the first time we have such disputes with the Islamic Waqf".</p>
<p>Adnan al-Husseini, director of the Islamic Waqf, denied it had taken over the rooms and said the dispute was being exaggerated.</p>
<p>"It is simply a dispute over a joint wall separating the Waqf property and the Patriarchate," Husseini said.</p>
<p>"We have set up a committee from both sides to solve the problem in an amicable manner as we always do with our brethren the Christians and both of us have agreed not to allow the intervention of the Israeli authorities," Husseini told Reuters.</p>
<p>Husseini said the Palestinian Authority, which controlled the Waqf, did not intervene in the dispute and "would accept any solution we reach with the Patriarchate".</p>
<p>But Timothy said the Patriarchate had already informed the Israeli government about the matter.</p>
<p>"We will try to solve the problem in a friendly manner, but if we fail, we will seek arbitration from the Israeli government," Timothy said.</p>
<p>Israeli officials were not available for comment.</p>
