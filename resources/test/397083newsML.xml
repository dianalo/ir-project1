<p>Walt Disney Co's agreement with PIXAR Animation Studios Inc calls for the companies to be equal partners in the production and profits of the studio's five upcoming films, officials with the companies said Monday.</p>
<p>At a news conference here, PIXAR Chairman Steve Jobs and Disney Chairman Michael Eisner said the two companies would share equally in the financing of the upcoming films and in the profits generated by the films once distribution costs and other expenses were deducted.  Under a prior agreement, Disney got the bulk of the profits from PIXAR's hit film "Toy Story."</p>
<p>Jobs said the new deal, covering five films over 10 years, is more attractive to PIXAR. "We're really partners in a very, very deep way for a very long time," he said.</p>
<p>Under terms of the deal, Disney will acquire one million shares of PIXAR stock for $15 a share and receive warrants to purchase an additional 1.5 million shares of PIXAR stock at higher prices, bringing Disney's total stake in PIXAR to five percent.</p>
<p>Disney's Eisner said the company has no plans to increase it stake further or to acquire a controlling stake in Pixar.</p>
