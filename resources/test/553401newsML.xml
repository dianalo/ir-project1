<p>Chanting mantras and dressed in multicolored robes, thousands of members of a mystical cult gathered near the Brazilian capital on Thursday to help the ancient souls they believe are trapped inside their bodies.</p>
<p>Each May 1 since 1976 pilgrims have flocked to the Valley of the Dawn to receive what leaders of the cult say is cosmic energy channelled to Earth by invisible spacecraft.</p>
<p>"We must free the spirits who are victims of our past," said Valley cult member Paulo Cruz, who explained he was possessed by the soul of a bloodthirsty Roman legionnaire.</p>
<p>Nearby, worshippers raised hands before images of Egyptian pharoahs inside a pyramid decorated with crucifixes, Jewish stars of David and Moslem sickle moons.</p>
<p>"We are the essence of all religions because, as constantly reincarnated spirits, we have been through them all," Cruz said, before providing a detailed explanation of the cult's philosophy about life, the inner soul and space.</p>
<p>Across a small lake shaped like the cult's symbol of an all-seeing eye, women wearing billowing skirts leaned on fake spears as they lined up to reach a distant altar. Despite the extravagant appearance of the "missionaries" -- who appear to have stepped off the set of a biblical movie -- they are mostly working-class Brazilians.</p>
<p>Brazil, often called the world's biggest Catholic nation, is a hotbed of religious, spiritual and mystical diversity. Ever since the slaves brought their gods from Africa, rival beliefs have mingled and blended.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of their remoteness, the arid highlands around Brasilia are dotted with cults and communities. In the mountains, villages observe biblical teachings to the letter and shun contact with outsiders.</p>
<p>In the hills overlooking the town of Alto Paraiso de Goais, dozens of white, egg-shaped temples are being built.</p>
<p>Local government officials say there are dozens of different groups in and around Brasilia. None has yet shown the tendency of cults elsewhere for mass suicide and officials plan to turn Brasilia into an "alternative tourism" mecca.</p>
<p>"We welcome everyone," said Vladimir de Carvalho, a radio presenter and the Valley's press spokesman. "After all, the people you see here are really Trojans, Phoenicians, ancient Greeks and the kings and queens of Europe."</p>
