<p>Gunmen killed six policemen and a civilian in Larkana, home town of Pakistan's ousted prime minister Benazir Bhutto, on Tuesday, police said.</p>
<p>A police spokesman said gunmen in a white car had ambushed a police vehicle at a railway crossing at Ghanti Gate in Larkana in the southern province of Sindh at 8.20 a.m. (0320 GMT).</p>
<p>He said a deputy superintendent of police was among six policemen killed. A civilian also died in the shooting.</p>
<p>"The bodies of the dead have been removed to Larkana Civil Hospital," Maulana Sattar Edhi, head of the private Edhi Welfare Trust, which runs an ambulance service, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The police spokesman in Karachi said he did not know the motive for the shooting. "We are still investigating," he said.</p>
<p>Sindh province gained a reputation for numerous robberies and kidnappings for ransom in the early 1990s, prompting the authorities to launch a military operation to flush out the gangs operating mainly in rural areas.</p>
