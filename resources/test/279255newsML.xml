<p>A dot fun? A dot biz? Did we hear a dot sex?</p>
<p>Well it seems it is all up to you, the seriously, and not so seriously surfing public, to decide what to call the new "top level domain names" that are about to be added to the Internet.</p>
<p>The Internet is at a serious juncture. It is exploding with thousands of new participants and Web sites and this means new domain name categories are crucial for the next levels of expansion.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is akin to Christopher Columbus standing at the bridge and wondering what to call all those clumps of land that kept rising before him on the horizon. The Internet is the same; as we expand we need new names for the dazzling digital world we are creating.</p>
<p>The de facto powers brokers of the Internet, which includes the U.S. based Internet Society, have decided that seven new categories should be added to the old groups that are used for arranging and finding Internet addresses.</p>
<p>Currently the Internet addresses under the old world are organized in the generic categories: ".com," ".org," ".edu," ".net," ".gov" and ".mil." There is one international domain, ".int," for groups with international connections such as those with connections to such groups as the United Nations.</p>
<p>The most overloaded category is in the ".com" category (short for commercial) where several thousand names are being added each day. There have been more than a few corporate fisticuffs  over the registering of names under this category because of copyright and other concerns.</p>
<p>For instance, what company has the right to the "sun.com" domain name when several companies use the name "Sun" in their legal corporate moniker? And what if an employee of a Sun company wanted to set up a home site for Sun employees?</p>
<p>Something called the International Ad Hoc Committee, formed by the Internet Society in October 1996, announced in mid-December that it would create the seven new categories to help relieve some of these problems. It hoped to announce the new names in February 1997 after getting feedback from various weighty groups of the Internet and from Netizens at large.</p>
<p>The group also wanted to introduce competition in the registering of domain names and planned to add between 20 and 30 new registrars per year. Currently, most addresses are handled by Network Solutions Inc. of Herndon, Va.</p>
<p>The full text of the recommendations have been posted at their site, http://www.iahc.org. The public can comment through e-mail, available at the site, and other methods up to Jan. 17, 1997.</p>
<p>This group envisioned that the new categories would consist of strings of three to five letters each and that the names would suggest some connection with the Internet.</p>
<p>The committee, made up of heavyweights from the Internet community, said they were faced with a formidable challenge in reaching a consensus on how to proceed:</p>
<p>"We accomplished our goal, in no small part, because we were able to bring people together from around the world, via the Internet, using electronic mail and the IAHC home page for postings." said Donald Heath, president of the Internet Society and chairman of the committee.</p>
<p>Martin Burack, executive director of the Internet Society, said they have been getting 200 to 500 messages a day on suggestions for new names. He said an obvious new category would be ".biz," which would help head off the explosion of demand for sites ending in ".com."</p>
<p>The mind can really wander when dreaming of the new digital lands that can be created by a few strokes of the keyboard. Perhaps we need a ".fun" category just for the heck of it or a ".joe" sector for noncommercial, just plain Joes and Josephines who wanted to create mock commercial sites such as "nike.joe" or "coke.joe."</p>
<p>Or what about language categories such as a ".fre" to encourage French language site development for people in Quebec and other Francophone regions.</p>
<p>Burack said the Internet Society was expecting a lot of input from the public before the new categories are chosen. He expected ".sex" to be a popular choice as well as a host of other ideas for new names.</p>
<p>"Believe me Internet folks are not shy," Burack said.</p>
