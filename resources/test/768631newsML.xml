<p>A businessman turned British government minister facing allegations of a conflict of interest has defended his handling of his shareholding in his former company British Petroleum Plc.</p>
<p>Lord David Simon, Minister for Trade and Competitiveness in Europe and former BP chairman, said he had obeyed every rule in dealing with his BP shares, worth some two million pounds ($3.3 million).</p>
<p>"Both the spirit and the letter of the rules have been followed in every way," Simon wrote in an article in Friday's edition of The Times newspaper.</p>
<p>The Conservatives, who faced a series of sleaze allegations which contributed to their crushing election defeat in May, have seized on the Simon affair as the first controversy over ministerial conduct in Prime Minister Tony Blair's government.</p>
<p>Blair earlier on Thursday published a new code of conduct to prevent ministers' personal interests conflicting with their government jobs.</p>
<p>But his Conservative opponents claimed the publication was a smokescreen to divert attention from the Simon case. Opposition industry spokesman John Redwood said Simon should resign or sell his shares.</p>
<p>Simon hit back by saying the Conservative attacks may deter other businessmen from following the example he set when he quit oil giant BP to take an unpaid government post less than three months ago.</p>
<p>"My one regret is that the row generated by the opposition may make other businessmen wary of becoming involved in government," he wrote in The Times.</p>
<p>"That would be a shame for politics. It would be a shame for Britain," he added.</p>
<p>Dealing with the opposition attacks in detail, Simon said no BP-specific matters came before him in his post. He added that he was keeping his BP shares pending a review of his access to insider information next January but added that he would not trade them in the meantime.</p>
<p>The new document on ministers' conduct published by Blair updates one under the previous administration.</p>
<p>In its foreword, Blair tells his colleagues: "We are all here to serve and we must all serve honestly and in the interests of those who gave us our positions of trust."</p>
