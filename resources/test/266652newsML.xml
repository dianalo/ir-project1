<p>Thousands of opposition protesters demanding a new government to bring Bulgaria out of economic crisis burned a giant effigy of Prime Minister Zhan Videnov outside parliament on Thursday.</p>
<p>"All over the world, people are celebrating Christmas and all we have here is misery," Ilich Tsvetkov, a senior official of the opposition Union of Democratic Forces (UDF), told the crowd which had marched through the city centre from the National Palace of Culture.</p>
<p>The rally comes two days before a congress of Videnov's ruling Socialists, which will discuss calls by reformists for a new prime minister and cabinet, and for separation of the functions of party chairman and prime minister.</p>
<p>Earlier on Thursday, the UDF presented to parliament a "salvation declaration", which it wants debated and voted at an extraordinary session after the New Year holiday.</p>
<p>The UDF says a fixed exchange rate regime under discussion with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will fail under the present government and it wants a new central bank board appointed to implement the currency board mechanism.</p>
<p>It wants parliament disbanded immediately and elections to be held in March, and negotiations with the IMF and World Bank on an economic programme to be conducted by an all-party team.</p>
<p>The Socialists have a secure majority in parliament and the UDF's proposals have not won much sympathy so far.</p>
<p>IMF experts who have been discussing technical details of the currency board are due to leave on Friday after presenting a draft report to the central bank.</p>
<p>An IMF negotiating mission must discuss the proposal with the government when details are finalised early next year.</p>
<p>Videnov said on December 9 the government planned a package of stabilisation measures to accompany introduction of a currency board, under which levs in circulation must be matched by central bank reserves.</p>
<p>The government has been slow to deliver on previous promises of structural reform but economists warn that a lev peg alone will not solve Bulgaria's problems unless it is accompanied by a serious commitment to measures delayed in the seven years since the end of one-party rule.</p>
