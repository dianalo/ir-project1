<p>Australian Karrie Webb won the women's British Open for the second time in three years with a record-breaking total at Sunningdale on Sunday.</p>
<p>The 22-year-old Queenslander, who led by eight shots after a record third round 63, posted a final round 71 to set a British Open record of 19 under par 269 - five better than the previous best set by American Jane Geddes at Ferndown in 1989.</p>
<p>American Rosie Jones birdied the 18th to match Webb's 71 and snatched second place from Sweden's Annika Sorenstam.</p>
<p>After taking the 82,500 pounds ($132,000) winner's cheque, and regaining the trophy she won at Woburn two years ago, Webb said: "I am over the moon to win the British Open again.</p>
<p>"I have been wondering when everything was going to come together and it was this week. I played brilliantly."</p>
<p>Webb, who won over a million dollars and topped the LPGA Order of Merit in her rookie season in the U.S. last year, stuttered in the early stages when she dropped three shots - she had only made two bogeys in the first three rounds - in an outward half of two over par 38. At that stage, the gap had narrowed to five over Jones, her playing partner.</p>
<p>But as the rain started to pour down, she birdied the 299-yard par four 11th from four feet, and back-to-back birdies at the 14th and 15th put her on easy street.</p>
<p>"I was a little bit concerned when the lead went down to five. But I learned from losing the Australian Masters (she led by five going into the final round) that I had to concentrate on my game," she said.</p>
