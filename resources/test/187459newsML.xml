<p>Key advisers in the Japanese government's economic reform drive unveiled a blueprint on Wednesday for sweeping deregulation in six major areas, including the financial sector and telecoms.</p>
<p>The deregulation advisory group is one of a number of bodies charged with formulating specific steps that together would realise Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's goal of fundamental "Big Bang" reforms by 2001.  </p>
<p>"Japan must implement free market rules and promote competition in order to revitalise the economy and reform the economic structure," the panel said in its final draft that is expected to form the basis for a government deregulation plan due out by March next year.</p>
<p>Key points included calls to give financial firms more freedom to expand their business and set their own stockbroking fees, and deregulation of Japan's vast telecoms market, although the panel expressed no opinion on the controversial question of breaking up phone giant NTT.  </p>
<p>Hashimoto has vowed to place top priority on slashing through the tangled red tape that stifles entrepreneurs, keeps costs high, hampers imports and can infuriate foreign companies trying to do business in Japan.</p>
<p>The panel, commissioned by the government's Economic Planning Agency (EPA), called for deregulation in the areas of finance, information technology, distribution, land, employment and medicine to invigorate the economy and ensure Japan can cope with the challenges of a rapidly ageing society.  </p>
<p>Proposals on financial deregulation included moves to liberalise commission fees for stockbroking and to allow banks, securities houses and insurance companies to enter each others' now-protected areas.</p>
<p>The draft also recommended the lifting of an almost 50-year ban on holding companies, firms which control one or more companies, often through a majority stake.</p>
<p>In his efforts to come up with specific deregulation plans, Hashimoto has already given similar but more specific financial deregulation proposals to the Finance Ministry.  </p>
<p>The panel proposed the dismantling of regulations which make it hard for firms to enter Japan's telecommunications market, almost 80 percent-dominated by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp (NTT).</p>
<p>The panel kept away from the touchy issue of breaking up NTT, only urging parties involved to reach a decision on the subject as soon as possible. But it urged the giant company to enter the international market, provided there was an environment of fair competition.  </p>
<p>Japan's complex distribution system was also attacked as hindering competition, and the panel called for the abolition of various restrictions on distribution channels.</p>
<p>The panel called for steps to boost liquidity in the real estate market, which would help financial institutions clean up bad loans following a sharp fall in land prices. The huge problem loans have become a symbol of the fragility of Japan's overall financial system.</p>
<p>The panel proposed reform of land taxes, including fixed-asset and transaction taxes.  </p>
<p>It also called for moves to create greater mobility in Japan's labour market -- where white-collar workers once counted on a job for life -- as one way of dealing with a rapidly ageing society. These included an easing of regulations on job placement and temporary staff businesses. It also suggested the government should revise income tax laws that discourage dependents from taking up full-time work.</p>
<p>Reform of the medical and welfare systems is also needed as Japan's society ages, the draft said.</p>
