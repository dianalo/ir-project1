<p>The Netherlands on Wednesday backed Germany's hardline stance on the introduction of a so-called stability pact to ensure continued budgetary discipline among EMU member states after the advent of a single currency area in 1999.</p>
<p>"It is in the Netherlands' interests that the partners in monetary union can be held to the budgetary discipline laid down in the Treaty (of Maastricht)," the finance ministry said in a policy document sent to parliament.</p>
<p>Countries entering the third and final phase of Economic and Monetary Union must continue to adhere to the convergence criteria, which stipulate national budget deficits may not exceed three percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).</p>
<p>The Dutch document backs German proposals for a more precise definition of key terms such as "exceptional economic circumstances", which would potentially enable countries with excessive deficits to escape sanctions.</p>
<p>The document summarised the Dutch stance on bolstering budgetary discipline in the EMU third phase as follows:</p>
<p>* Netherlands backs proposals for compulsory submission and updating of stability programmes by EMU participants and convergency programmes by would-be participants.</p>
<p>* It agrees with proposed target for EMU participants of a deficit 'close to balance'.</p>
<p>* Analyses to determine the Dutch approach to a 'close to balance' budget will be conducted by a special task force.</p>
<p>* Netherlands has no objection to combining several steps in the excessive deficits procedure where possible. It favours such procedures taking no more than one year.</p>
<p>* Dutch agree with the nature of proposed EU sanctions against countries with excessive deficits, ie. a fixed percentage of GDP of the country concerned and a variable determined according to the measure in which the country diverges from the three percent deficit norm.</p>
<p>* Dutch back EU proposals to set the sanctions at a fixed 0.2 percent of GDP plus 0.10 percent of the amount to which a country's deficit exceeds the three percent norm.</p>
<p>* Netherlands believes sanctions should in first instance be imposed in the form of an interest-free deposit. This may be converted to a fine later -- preferably after two years.</p>
<p>* Income resulting from fines should be passed on to EMU member states which do not have excessive deficits. However, Netherlands will agree to such monies flowing into EU coffers if European Commission guarantees this will result in lower contributions from member states rather than higher EU spending.</p>
<p>* Netherlands has no objection to a more precise definition of exceptional and temporary economic circumstances and backs German, EU suggestions on this as good points of departure.</p>
<p>* A firm definition of 'heavy recession' is necessary in order to avoid undermining the stability pact.</p>
