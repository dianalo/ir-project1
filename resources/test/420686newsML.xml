<p>Albanian army and police forces pushed towards the south on Wednesday to quash an armed rebellion and fighting was reported near the Adriatic town of Sarande.</p>
<p>Army forces, backed by police, secured roads to the flashpoint town of Vlore on the Adriatic coast and the mountainous route between Gjirokaster and the coastal town of Sarande, a goverment information official said.</p>
<p>"There is no way the residents can come out of Sarande to Gjirokaster," the official said. "It is a small river valley and rocky," he added, describing the route between the two towns.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses reported clashes between insurgents and army units between Sarande and Delvine, 20 km (12 miles) to the east, throughout the morning.</p>
<p>An eyewitness said rebels had seized an army tank in Sarande on Wednesday and were driving it through the streets.</p>
<p>Hundreds of heavily-armed insurgents had set up a defence line in the hills at the entrance to the town, the witness said.</p>
<p>An Albanian fighter plane was seen flying over the village of Livina, about 10 km (six miles) east of Sarande. Smoke rose from the area just after it passed, they said.</p>
<p>Albania denied that two of its air force pilots who defected to southern Italy had been given orders to shoot at civilians as part of operations to crack down on the uprising.</p>
<p>A Defence Ministry statement said the pilots, who landed their MiG-15 plane at an Italian base near Lecce and asked for asylum on Tuesday, had been on a reconnaissance flight.</p>
<p>One of the two pilots told Italian reporters they switched course rather than carry out orders to open fire.</p>
<p>"These declarations are totally untrue. Not a single order was given to open fire against the civil population. The aim of the flight was to quickly know the...situation," the Defence Ministry statement said.</p>
<p>It said operations launched on Monday by security forces under a state of emergency to quell disorder had not involved any firefights with between the two sides.</p>
<p>More than 20 people have been reported killed since Friday in the southern port of Vlore, abandoned by the authorities, and other southern towns after rioters raided army and police weapons stores.</p>
<p>Albania said on Wednesday that army chief of staff General Sheme Kosova had been dismissed and replaced by Major General Adem Copani, President Sali Berisha's personal military adviser.</p>
<p>A statement from the prime minister's office published in the newspaper Rilindja Demokratike said Kosova had been sacked for failing to ensure adequate security at military posts stormed and looted of their weapons by "terrorists".</p>
<p>A Defence Ministry statement said Kosova had been replaced by Copani. Neither said whether Kosova had been arrested.</p>
<p>The insurgents have defied a state of emergency imposed on Sunday by the government and an accompanying shoot-on-sight order for anyone in the streets with unauthorised weapons.</p>
<p>Albania has been rocked by anti-government protnear the Greek border, was quiet on Wednesday. Security forces had set up roadblocks around the town in an area heavily populated by ethnic Greeks.</p>
