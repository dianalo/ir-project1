<p>Sovereign Bancorp Inc and Bankers Corp said Thursday they had agreed to merge in a stock swap valued at $325 million.</p>
<p>Sovereign will exchange $25.50 of its stock for each share of Bankers Corp, they said.</p>
<p>The deal values Bankers Corp stock at 164 percent of book value and 12.5 times the company's earnings of the last 12 months, the bank holding companies said.</p>
<p>The merger is expected to be accretive to Sovereign's 1997 and 1998 earnings and will expand Sovereign's operations in New Jersey, the companies said.  </p>
<p>Sovereign and Bankers Corp said the acquisition price will stay at $25.50 per Bankers share if Sovereign's average stock price remains between $11 and $16.50 during a 15-day period prior to the closing of the acquisition.</p>
<p>If Sovereign's average stock price falls below $11 during the pricing period, Bankers Corp shareholders will receive a fixed rate of 2.318 shares of Sovereign for each share, the companies said.</p>
<p>An increase in Sovereign's share price beyond $16.50 in the pricing period would reduce the exchange ratio to 1.545 Sovereign shares for each Bankers Corp share.</p>
<p>Bankers Corp has the right to terminate the deal if Sovereign's average stock price falls below $10.31 and Sovereign's decline in value is 15 percent greater than the percentage decline of a group of similar banking companies, the companies said.</p>
<p>Sovereign's acquisition of Bankers Corp, which has $2.5 million in assets, will make Sovereign the sixth largest bank in New Jersey in terms of deposits.</p>
<p>Sovereign had $9.4 billion in assets as of December 31, 1996.</p>
