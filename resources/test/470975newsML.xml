<p>A plan by U.S. car giant Ford Motor Co to increase its stake in a Chinese truck maker is a bet on the future of China's auto industry, as revitalising the Chinese partner could take years, analysts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ford announced on Wednesday that it planned to increase its investment in Jiangling Motors Corp with the purchase of $54.5 million worth of shares.</p>
<p>"In the longer term it is a beneficial deal, because they (Jiangling) have been losing out in the competition for market share -- and if they don't do something they can't compete at all," said An Lu, vice president of China research at Salomon Brothers in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Under the subscription agreement, Ford said it had agreed to increase its equity share in its Chinese partner to about 30 percent from the current 20 percent.</p>
<p>The agreement is subject to approval of Jiangling's shareholders, who will discuss it at a meeting scheduled for April 30, and China's regulatory authorities, Ford said.</p>
<p>Ford and Jiangling are developing a light commercial vehicle that will be launched as a nine- and a 12-seater bus, a Ford spokeswoman told Reuters. A van and a chassis cab, or pick-up truck, would follow, also produced at Jiangling's plant in Nanchang, eastern Jiangxi province, she said.</p>
<p>Jiangling's share of China's top-end light truck market had fallen in recent years to 15-18 percent from about 20 percent as that of its major competitor, Qingling Motors, had risen to about 21 percent, Salomon's Lu said.</p>
<p>He said Qingling's use of Japanese technology through its cooperative deal with Isuzu put it one car generation, or about 10 years, ahead of Jiangling.</p>
<p>Qingling vehicles also commanded a premium of about 10 percent because of their use of the Isuzu name and technology.</p>
<p>Qingling had sold about 35,000 vehicles in 1996, Lu said. Jiangling said in December it expected 1996 sales to reach 17,000 vehicles, compared to 20,500 in 1995.</p>
<p>An injection of Ford capital and technology for Jiangling would be a welcome step towards the future, said analyst John Lu at ING-Barings in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Continued economic growth would spur infrastructure development, he said, and growth of China's interior would spur demand for light trucks for passenger and goods transport.</p>
<p>An analyst with a western bank in Shenzhen, where Jiangling is listed, said the deal would help lower Jiangling's production costs, a substantial overhead in car manufacturing.</p>
<p>Some analyst sources said, however, it could be up to three years before Jiangling was able to effectively utilise the unfamiliar Ford capital and technology.</p>
<p>"I don't know how they will merge their two technologies," Salomon's Lu said. "Or will they choose the new Ford technology and replace the old with the new -- which would mean they have much higher start-up costs."</p>
<p>"Jiangling will still need at least a couple of years to get production up and running using new technology that is unfamiliar to them, and in redeveloping their market," Lu said.</p>
<p>The Shenzhen-based banker said the announcement of the deal should not have any effect on Jiangling's share price,</p>
<p>"There will be some dilution, but the effect would be countered by better company prospects," she said.</p>
<p>Trading in Jiangling shares was suspended on Wednesday morning on the announcement. After trading resumed, its B shares edged up slightly to HK$4.00 against HK$3.98 at Tuesday's close.</p>
