<p>Shares of leading exporters, such as Toyota Motor Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd, lost further ground on Thursday morning due to market caution about the yen's strength against the dollar, traders said.</p>
<p>As of 0033 GMT, Toyota shares were ask-only at 3,330 yen, below Wednesday's close of 3,480.</p>
<p>Honda shares were down 160 yen at 3,320. Its turnover was 1.920 million shares, making it the fourth heaviest issue on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  </p>
<p>At 0106 GMT shares of Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd were down 30 yen at 2,120, and TDK Corp were down 40 yen at 8,550</p>
<p>"As the future trend of currencies is unclear, institutional investors secured profits in high-techs and exporters," said a dealer at a second-tier Japanese securities house.</p>
