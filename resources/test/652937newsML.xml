<p>Japan's Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko left for home on Wednesday after a two-week visit to Argentina and Brazil, the first imperial trip to Latin America.</p>
<p>In Argentina Akihito and President Carlos Menem expressed a wish to deepen the already close relationship between their countries and boasted that 1998 would mark a century of diplomatic ties.</p>
<p>"Apart from the bond of friendship, there are shared cultural tastes ... like tango and the movies of Akira Kurosawa," Menem said at a dinner he gave for the imperial couple on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Akihito said Argentina had always helped Japan in times of need, giving it two warships in 1900 before the Russo-Japanese War and sending a huge shipment of food after the Second World War.</p>
<p>The couple arrived in Argentina on Monday after a 10-day visit to Brazil, where 1.3 million people of Japanese descent constitute the largest Japanese community abroad.</p>
