<p>The Australian Wool Production Forecasting Committee (AWPFC) has maintained its forecast of lower Australian shorn wool production in 1996/97 ending June 30 but has forecast a 0.9 percent production increase in 1997/98.</p>
<p>AWPFC's latest 1996/97 production estimate is steady with its previous forecast at 639 million kg within a range of 625 and 655 million kg.</p>
<p>This represents a fall of 2.4 percent on 1995/96 production of 655 million kg, it said.</p>
<p>Production in 1997/98 is forecast to rise by 0.9 percent to 645 million kg, its first increase since 1992/93.  </p>
<p>The committee considered current receival data, which is currently three percent above the equivalent period in 1995/96 (July to February), it said.</p>
<p>Receivals are expected to decline relative to 1995/96 over the remainder of the 1996/97 season and to be down by one percent at the close of 1996/97, it said.</p>
<p>Receivals are expected to include six to 10 million kg of carryover stocks released from farms during 1996/97, it said.</p>
<p>The 1996/97 forecast is based on an opening flock of 121.2 million, down from 123.2 million in 1994/95, and 143.4 million sheep and lambs shorn at an average cut per head of 4.46 kg.  </p>
<p>The 1997/98 forecast is based on estimated opening numbers of 122 million and a total shear of 144 million head at an average cut per head of 4.48 kg.</p>
<p>The 1997/98 forecast is based on average seasonal conditions prevailing in most wool producing areas, it said.</p>
<p>The shift toward a higher crossbred component in the flock was expected to continue in 1997/98, it said.</p>
<p>The committee will meet next on August 21.</p>
