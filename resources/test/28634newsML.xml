<p>Hungary's hog livestock stood at 5.80 million at August 1, up 14 percentage points over June 30, 1995, the Central Statistical Office (KSH) said in a statement.</p>
<p>The number of sows reached 426,000, rising three percentage points.</p>
<p>No KSH official was immediately available to explain why KSH compared the August 1 date to end of June last year.</p>
<p>"The situation of pig breeders continued to deteriorate in the reviewed period," KSH said, adding that individual breeders suffered the biggest falls in profitability.</p>
<p>"This will presumably induce an increase of meat price in the coming one year period," it said.</p>
