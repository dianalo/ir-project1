<p>U.S. Open champion Ernie Els shot a three-under-par 68 Friday to extend his lead in the Buick Classic at Westchester Country Club to three strokes.</p>
<p>Els stood at 10-under-par 132, three strokes ahead of Jim Furyk, who also shot a three-under round of 68. In third place at six under were Jeff Maggert (69) and Brad Fabel (67).</p>
<p>Paul Azinger would have entered the weekend rounds tied with Maggert and Fabel at six under, but forgot to sign the scorecard for his 69 and was disqualified.</p>
<p>"I simply missed it. I've never done this before during my entire career. Obviously, I am upset about doing something this silly. It especially hurts since I was playing so well this week.</p>
<p>"But those are the rules and I certainly do respect them," said Azinger after rules officials informed him he was in violation of Rule 6-6.</p>
<p>Prior to being notified of his disqualification, Azinger, who has not won a tournament since being diagnosed with cancer in 1993, was feeling optimistic about his chances this week -- although he saw Els as the biggest threat.</p>
<p>"This is a good start, I'm playing solid golf and am pleased with the way my game is going. The only real obstacle is Ernie, he's the most confident man in the field. He won here by eight shots last year, loves the course and comes in as U.S. Open champ.</p>
<p>"The writing could be on the wall already," said Azinger.</p>
<p>Els has been leading the Buick Classic for six straight rounds now. The first-round leader, he won wire to wire last year with an eight-stroke winning margin.</p>
<p>Starting the second round on Friday at seven under par, he picked up three birdies in the first five holes. "When I got it to 10 under through five I had visions of going really low again, but it didn't work out that way," said Els.</p>
<p>Els had one other birdie, and a bogey on the par-four 12th, the most difficult hole on the course. "All in all it was a good round with not too many mistakes, except for the 12th. I feel I'm concentrating quite nicely right now.</p>
<p>"As I get over the ball I am focused on the shot I have to play. Hopefully I can stay that way and won't get tired on the weekend from everything that's happened in the last week," said Els.</p>
<p>Though Els is the U.S. Open champion, tournament leader, and in beautiful control of his game, the majority of the attention was, as usual, on Tiger Woods.</p>
<p>Woods came close to missing the cut, though not as close as he feared. He ended up two strokes on the right side of the cut line, which came at three over.</p>
<p>At three over par through 17 holes, Woods believed he needed birdie on his last hole, Westchester's par-five ninth, to make the cut. He drove into a fairway bunker, chose not to lay up, and hit a two-iron just off the green. Chipping to five feet, Woods made the putt for birdie.</p>
<p>"I knew I needed that putt. You never want to miss the cut," said Woods, who has never missed a cut as a professional.</p>
<p>At two over par, Woods is 12 strokes behind Els. "I'm just not in the position I want to be. All day it was either long left or weak right. Hopefully, things will turn around this weekend," said Woods.</p>
<p>New Zealand's Grant Waite was disqualified after he did not show up for his second round. Tournament officials did not immediately know why.</p>
