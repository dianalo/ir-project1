<p>Acindar Industria Argentina de Aceros' $100 million deal led issuance on Friday in the latest of tightly priced Southern Hemisphere paper, dealers said.</p>
<p>The deal, priced at par to yield 11-1/4 percent or 491 basis points over the U.S. Treasury curve, came 25 to 50 basis points below earlier speculation.</p>
<p>Acindar may have had some help from owners of its outstanding putable issue, one high-yield source said. The put price rose more than one point since its effective date in November, the source said, suggesting the company encouraged investors to exercise the option and buy the new paper.  </p>
<p>"If they did this deal without having an agreement that (owners of the putable issue) would put their bonds, it would have been quite difficult for them," said a high-yield syndicate source.</p>
<p>Lead manager Credit Suisse First Boston did not return phone calls.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, International CableTel's $300 million deal quickly became $500 million and priced via a Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities group in a private placement, traders said.  </p>
<p>The two-part deal included $400 million 10-year senior notes priced to yield 10 percent or 347 basis points over Treasuries and $100 million exchangeable pay-in-kind preferred securities due 2009 priced at par with a 13 percent dividend.</p>
<p>Also on Friday, Optel Inc is expected to issue $225 million senior notes due 2005, with warrants, at a yield inside of 13 percent via Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>Turning to investment grades, no new issues were firmly set to price on Friday. Rumors of a large Ford global issue were widespread, but several syndicate desks also said the talk had little substance.</p>
<p>Street talk suggested Salomon Brothers is working up an inflation-indexed bond deal.</p>
<p>Most issuers voluntarily sidelined issues for Friday given the release of U.S. employment data, managers said. Although the market rallied after the number, they said issuers would likely look for some extension of price gains and a new week before coming to market.</p>
