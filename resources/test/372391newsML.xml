<p>Two Bahraini MPs visited Iraq on Wednesday for the first time since the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.</p>
<p>"Me and brother Mohammed Hassan Kamaladdin are here to assess humanitarian conditions of Iraqis suffering from the (U.N.) embargo," Ali Ben Jabr al-Moslem of the Bahraini Shora council (parliament) told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said they brought medicine but would arrange more food and medical aid to ease problems caused by the stringent U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.</p>
<p>Iraq gave the Bahrainis a red-carpet welcome, with the official Iraqi News Agency reporting their meetings with senior officials including speaker of the National Assembly Saadoun Hammadi.</p>
<p>Iraq is not allowed to export oil but under an oil-for-food deal with the United Nations Baghdad has been allowed since December to sell oil worth $2 billion every six months to pay for urgent needs.</p>
<p>Iraq on Tuesday complained that food supplies under the deal were taking too long to arrive but U.N. and U.S. officials said Baghdad was hindering operations.</p>
<p>Last Novemeber Bahraini businessmen visited Baghdad to seek deals under the oil-for-food pact. Bahraini officials denied they were sent by the government.</p>
<p>Iraq's relations with Arab Gulf states have been strained since the invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Bahrain and other Gulf allies backed the U.S.-led multinational force that drove Iraqi troops from the emirate in 1991.</p>
<p>Oman, Qatar and to some extent the United Arab Emirates have improved ties with Baghdad but Saudi Arabia and Kuwait reject direct dealings.</p>
