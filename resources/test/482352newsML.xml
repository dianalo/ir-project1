<p>Luxembourg-based steel group Arbed said on Wednesday it tumbled into loss in 1996 after a sharp fall in steel prices that only began to recover at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Arbed said that because of a shrinking economy, European steel production had fallen sharply in 1996. At the same time clients' destocking and a large drop in spending on investments had contributed to a tumble in steel prices.</p>
<p>"It was not until the last months of 1996 that the trend turned around under the influence of a pick up in demand accompanied by a selective increase in prices," Arbed said in a statement.</p>
<p>"This tendency has been confirmed in the first quarter of 1997," it added.</p>
<p>The steel maker said a loss in long products had not been compensated for by positive results in the group's other sectors.</p>
<p>Arbed made a group loss of 1.21 billion Luxembourg francs ($34.9 million) after a 3.66 group net profit in 1995. It announced a 1996 consolidated net loss of 928 million versus a 6.615 billion profit.</p>
<p>Turnover fell 9.7 percent - or 4.6 percent on a comparable consolidation basis - to 232.23 billion francs.</p>
<p>Gross operating profit dropped 37 percent to 19.48 and cashflow more than halved to 10.50 billion.</p>
<p>Arbed said in a statement it had substantially reduced net financial charges in 1996 of 6.7 billion francs, an exceptional loss of 0.7 billion and taxes of 840 million. It gave no comparative figures.</p>
<p>After large investments net financial debt rose to 81.6 billion from 75.9 billion at the end of 1995.</p>
<p>Arbed's production of iron ore, pellets and pellet feed held steady at 21.83 million tonnes, and crude steel output climbed 2.3 percent to 11.77 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Rolled steel production rose 2.5 percent to 10.91 million tonnes. This included 6.49 million tonnes of flat steel, a rise of 5.5 percent, and 3.98 million of long steel, a fall of 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>Arbed's parent company profit fell 44 percent to 767 million francs. ($ = 34.72 Luxembourg Francs)</p>
