<p>The Bank of England left official interest rates unchanged Wednesday after the regular monthly meeting between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George.</p>
<p>The Bank set an unchanged repo rate of 6.0 percent for its routine money market operations after the meeting.</p>
<p>Clarke, the country's finance minister, sets interest rates after taking advice from the Bank of England, but the central bank normally makes no formal announcement if rates are left unchanged.</p>
<p>George has been pressing recently for a rise of a quarter of a percentage point in interest rates because he fears a resurgence in inflation.</p>
<p>But Clarke, whose Conservative government faces an election in the next two months, has rejected his advice, arguing that there is no clear evidence that the economy is about to overheat.</p>
<p>Clarke has a strong political incentive not to raise rates before upcoming national elections as this would mean more expensive home loans for millions of Britons.</p>
