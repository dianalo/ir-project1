<title>USA: Rhode Island's abortion law enforcement halted.</title>
<headline>Rhode Island's abortion law enforcement halted.</headline>

<p>A federal judge on Friday issued a temporary restraining order barring enforcement of Rhode Island's law banning the so-called "partial birth abortion" procedure.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Ronald Lagueux issued the order and set an Aug. 4 date for a hearing in which American Civil Liberties Union lawyers will argue that the law, signed by Gov. Lincoln Almond last week, is overly vague and unconstitutional.</p>
<p>"The order means that physicians can perform their abortion procedures without felony penalties being lodged against them," through the hearing date, ACLU spokesman Steven Brown said.</p>
<p>Rhode Island Attorney General Jeffrey Pine, an abortion-rights advocate, will defend the statute, his spokesman Gregg Perry said, adding, "the law is the law."</p>
<p>The measure barring the intact dilation and extraction procedure mirrors one vetoed by President Clinton last year. Clinton has said he will veto a similar bill passed by Congress again this year.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, brought on behalf of Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island and two doctors, contends the law is so vague that physicians potentially face criminal and civil penalties for performing almost any abortion by any method after the first trimester of pregnancy.</p>
<p>The procedure involves the partial extraction of the fetus feet first, the subsequent suctioning out of the brain and the removal of the fetus.</p>
