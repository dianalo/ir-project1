<headline>EU sees continued growth in demand for ships.</headline>

<p>Demand for ships has recently shown a tendency to increase and it is expected to grow further until shortly after the year 2000, the European Commission said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Thanks to the present increased level of demand and its expected further growth until shortly after 2000, present capacity utilisation of shipyards, including the European shipyards, is satisfactory," a discussion paper said.</p>
<p>In 1996, capacity utilisation of European yards was more than 80 percent, the Commission document said.</p>
<p>"After 2000 a drop in demand is expected which might accentuate the overcapacity problem, notably when considering that world shipbuilding capacity is expected to increase by 16-24 percent between 1994 and 2000 (source:OECD)," it said.</p>
<p>The paper, to be presented to EU industry ministers at their next meeting on April 24, said the demand increase had been caused by the higher volume of maritime transport and by the necessity to replace a growing part of the world fleet which has currently an average age of over 20 years.</p>
<p>"This need for replacement is further enforced by the need to adapt the fleet to new safety rules and environmental protection considerations," it added.</p>
<p>The world order book at the end of last year would guarantee on average two years of work, given the present level of production capacities.</p>
<p>It said the EU was able to hold on to its market share of 20 percent in terms of volume while the two main competitors from the Far East -- Japan and South Korea -- had a combined market share of 60 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>However, in terms of the value of the 1996 orderbook, Europe, with 31 percent, was ahead of Japan or South Korea.</p>
<p>"This reflects its higher market share in the high value segements, where competition from Japanese and Korean yards is expected to intensify in the future," it said.</p>
