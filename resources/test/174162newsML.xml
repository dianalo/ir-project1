<p>European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert improved the odds on Thursday that the EU will clear the giant merger between British Telecom and MCI, saying he was happy with the state of the British telecommunications market.</p>
<p>Although BT still had a "de facto' dominant position on the British market, "They are not misusing their dominant position. Competitors are given a chance in the British market," Van Miert told reporters.</p>
<p>The two companies announced earlier this week they were pooling their operations in their Concert joint venture, the largest cross-border deal of its kind ever.</p>
<p>The merger, valued at $20 billion, faces its most important anti-trust test in the United States where legislation forbids a foreign company from taking more than 20 percent in an American firm unless its home market is effectively open to competition.</p>
<p>BT already has a 20-percent stake in MCI, acquired in 1993 when the two companies launched Concert to provide value added and enhanced telecoms services to multinational companies.</p>
<p>The deal was cleared by both the U.S. and EU competition authorities after several provisions were introduced to avoid, in particular, BT controlling or influencing MCI.</p>
<p>"It was an easy case because both markets were already liberalised," Van Miert told a conference on competition policy organised by the Brussels-based weekly newspaper European Voice.</p>
<p>This contrasted with the more recent global telecoms alliances that the Commission had to deal with, Van Miert said.</p>
<p>He singled out the Global One deal between France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and Sprint of the United States which took almost two years to clear due to strong resistance from the French and German governments to allow competition in their domestic markets.</p>
<p>Van Miert declined to comment on whether the full merger of BT and MCI, the second largest U.S. telecoms operator after AT&amp;T, will be as easy a case now as in 1993.</p>
<p>The Commission's services were still assessing whether it will fall under the bloc's fast-track merger rules, which allow for clearance within a month of formal notification if no serious problems arise.</p>
<p>But even if this was not the case, Van Miert thought the Commission would have to investigate it.</p>
<p>His services are expected to conclude "in the next few days" whether the merger regulation applies.</p>
<p>To qualify for a review under the regulation, the two companies must have a European turnover of 250 million European currency units ($317.3 million) each. BT met this threshold, Van Miert said, but MCI's figure was being checked.</p>
<p>BT's head of EU affairs Larry Stone told Reuters on Monday he was confident the deal would be cleared under the merger rules.</p>
