<p>For anyone who missed the press reports and magazine exclusives detailing the divorce of Britain's Prince Charles and Princess Diana, the gory details will be available soon on CD-ROM.</p>
<p>"Fourteen Weddings &amp; A Divorce", will be in the shops in November, distributor VCI Software said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>VCI said the CD-ROM spelled out "the romantic and public history of the royal family in the 20th Century". Charles, the heir to the throne, and Diana finalised their divorce two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The CD-ROM charts the history, romances, affairs, weddings and tragedies of the House of Windsor with video clips, archive recordings, pictures and text.</p>
<p>"There is a phenomenal interest in the royal family in this country, the United States, Japan and the whole world," Julian Moore, VCI head of marketing, said.</p>
<p>"It is a populist approach but interesting also in a historical sense. We think it will be a big seller."</p>
<p>The CD-ROM will sell for 29.99 pounds ($46.64).</p>
