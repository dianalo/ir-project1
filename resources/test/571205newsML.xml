<p>Iran's presidential election on May 23 may go to a run-off, lawmakers predicted in remarks published on Thursday.</p>
<p>Four candidates were approved on Wednesday to seek the presidency out of 238 hopefuls. Campaigning to replace President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who must stand down in August after two four-year terms in office, begins on Saturday.</p>
<p>A run-off would be called if no candidate won an absolute majority of more than 50 percent of the vote on May 23.</p>
<p>"Definitely the candidates have to face run-off," said Majlis (parliament) deputy Samad Qassempour.</p>
<p>"But it is difficult to forecast who will face the second round of the presidential election," he said in an interview with the English-language daily newspaper Iran News.</p>
<p>Qassempour is head of the Tabriz branch of the Society for the Defence of the Values of the Islamic Revolution, whose secretary-general former intelligence minister Mohammad Mohammadi Reyshahri is one of the four approved candidates.</p>
<p>The others are Majlis speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri, former culture and Islamic guidance minister Mohammad Khatami, and Reza Zavarei, deputy head of the judiciary.</p>
<p>All four are Shi'ite Moslems, and all but Zavarei are clergymen.</p>
<p>Another deputy, Ghulam Haydar Ebrahimbaie Salami, told Iran News: "Most probably, the candidates will have to face a run-off.</p>
<p>"In this case Mr...Khatami will be the first following Nateq-Nouri."</p>
<p>The latest public opinion poll showed none of the four candidates was likely to win election outright.</p>
<p>The survey published on Wednesday showed Nateq-Nouri in the lead with 40.8 percent of popular support among a sample of 1,182 Tehran residents, with 33.8 percent for Khatami and 8.2 percent for Reyshahri.</p>
<p>Zavarei was not mentioned individually in the poll results and the remaining 17.2 percent was made up by support for other candidates and people who were undecided or did not respond.</p>
