<p>A predominantly black inner-city neighbourhood in St. Petersburg exploded in rage on Thursday after police shot and killed a black motorist during a routine traffic stop.</p>
<p>Angry crowds threw rocks, bricks and bottles at police and set fire to cars and businesses. Police said at least six policemen, a fireman and four journalists were injured, and two arrests were made.</p>
<p>"We have fires throughout the city, residential fires," police spokeswoman Lilla Davis said. "We're doing what we can to quell the situation."</p>
<p>Police said the incident began when two officers, a white male and a white female, stopped a car for speeding in a south St. Petersburg neighbourhood with a history of trouble with drug dealers.</p>
<p>They shot the motorist because they believed he was trying to run them down after his gold Pontiac lurched forward, police said. But some witnesses said the driver had done nothing to prompt the shooting.</p>
<p>"She shot him for nothing, nothing," Rachel Wilson, who witnessed the traffic stop, told St. Petersburg television station WTOG.</p>
<p>Wilson said the car's driver had his hands in the air when he was shot. The man died before reaching Bayfront Medical Centre, a local hospital.</p>
<p>The riot began shortly afterward at the intersection where the shooting took place. The crowd began to throw rocks and bottles at police, and scattered rioting spread over several blocks as word of the shooting spread.</p>
<p>"We're tired of this. We are tired of what's happening out there to our brothers," one witness told WHNZ television in Miami.</p>
<p>More than 350 local police, many in full riot gear, were deployed and cordoned off the area as helicopters flew overhead. Police said there were reports of some looting.</p>
<p>"The situation right now is beginning to calm down a great deal," Police Chief Darryl Stevens told a news conference shortly before 1 a.m. EDT (0500 GMT). "As the night goes on we think there will be fewer and fewer incidents."</p>
<p>Community leaders called for calm and attributed the violence to small groups of young men who were roaming the streets setting fires, looting and throwing bricks and rocks.</p>
<p>St. Petersburg Mayor David Fisher said the state attorney's office would investigate the incident. City officials will meet with black community leaders on Friday morning to try to prevent a recurrence of the violence, he said.</p>
<p>"These things are spontaneous, it just ignites," he said. "It's kind of a wake-up call that you have a lot of work to do."</p>
<p>A police cruiser was set on fire and a police officer was shot in the arm during the rioting, but there were no reports of any deaths or serious injuries. Local hospitals reported they had treated about a dozen people for minor injuries.</p>
<p>A news van from television station WTOG and a private car belonging to one of the station's reporters was attacked by the rioters.</p>
<p>Police urged residents to stay indoors and not travel in the affected area. At least two houses, a post office, a grocery store and a florist's shop were reportedly burned. Fisher said at least 17 separate fires were reported.</p>
<p>Firefighters were unable to reach some of the burning buildings, advancing slowly down the street toward the burning houses under guard by a line of police.</p>
<p>In New Orleans, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said the White House had seen some news reports of the disturbances in St. Petersburg.</p>
<p>"We are trying to contact local officials for an assessment of the situation," he told reporters.</p>
