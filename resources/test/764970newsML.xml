<p>The Senate on Wednesday passed legislation to lift the U.S. embargo on tuna caught by Mexico and other countries that use encircling nets which also may snare and kill dolphin.</p>
<p>But the bill, which passed 99-0, would bar cans of tuna from being labeled "dolphin safe" until at least March 1999, when a study is to be done on how dolphin populations are affected by the fishing practice.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives passed its version of the bill this spring to lift the embargo on tuna caught in encircling nets. That bill would immediately allow cans of tuna to be labeled as dolphin-safe as long as no dolphin deaths were seen by shipboard observers.</p>
<p>But a number of Senate Democrats objected to adding the label to this tuna until there was a study showing populations were not significantly affected.</p>
<p>The U.S. embargo and "dolphin safe" label stem from an outcry in the late 1980s when the public became aware that hundreds of thousands of dolphins were killed each year in fishing operations in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Ocean, where tuna tend to swim below dolphins.</p>
<p>Fishermen using helicopters and speed boats herded the dolphin and set nets on top of them, slashing and drowning dolphins to catch the tuna.</p>
<p>To try to recapture the U.S. market, Mexico, Venezuela and other countries that fish those waters have adopted methods to release dolphin and reduce annual kill to fewer than 3,000.</p>
<p>The Clinton administration pushed repeal of the embargo as a way to encourage those countries to continue the safer fishing methods and to avoid a nasty trade dispute.</p>
<p>A number of wildlife conservation groups also backed the repeal as a way to put into law a voluntary agreement by the United States, Mexico and 10 other countries that fish in the eastern Pacific to use methods that protect dolphins.</p>
<p>Conservation groups including Greenpeace and the Centre for Marine Conservation also say alternative fishing methods such as setting nets on floating logs and debris resulted in far greater by-catch of sea turtles, sharks and other threatened or endangered marine life.</p>
<p>"We know that the methods of fishing we currently refer to as dolphin-safe are bad for other species," an aide to Representative Wayne Gilchrest, a Maryland Republican who sponsored the House bill, said. He said there were questions whether the Senate bill's delay in the dolphin-safe label change would end up hurting other species more than helping dolphin.</p>
<p>But the House was expected to accept the Senate compromise to move the bill quickly, congressional and environmental sources said.</p>
<p>Under the Senate bill, the embargo would be lifted once an international agreement on dolphin protections is in place. The Commerce Department after a study would decide by early 1999 whether encircling dolphins harmed populations to determine whether to change the definition of the "dolphin safe" label. That decision would be reviewed in two years.</p>
