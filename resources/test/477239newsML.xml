<p>Fresh twists in the Bre-X Minerals Ltd. saga on Monday failed to clear the fog of uncertainty that has enveloped the troubled Canadian gold exploration company since last week.</p>
<p>Bre-X has been under fire since test results from partner Freeport-McMoRan Copper &amp; Gold Inc. last week called into question Bre-X's claim that the Busang property in the jungles of Borneo was possibly the biggest gold find this century.</p>
<p>Disgruntled shareholders went on the warpath. A group in the United States filed a class action lawsuit in Texas on Friday, Houston-based law firm Baker &amp; Botts said on Monday.</p>
<p>"Basically it's a class-action on behalf of Bre-X shareholders who have been injured in buying or selling the stock over the last three or four years," Paul Yetter, a lawyer with Baker &amp; Botts, said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>"Beginning in 1994 defendants convinced the world that Bre-X owned 90 percent of a massive gold deposit, perhaps the largest ever discovered, located in the Busang area of East Kalimantan, Indonesia. This was false," the plaintiffs alleged in the suit, which named Bre-X and its chief executive David Walsh among the defendants.</p>
<p>"Indeed it now appears that a multi-billion dollar fraud may have been perpetrated on the investing public," they said in court papers.</p>
<p>Bre-X, clearly on the defensive, issued a statement on Monday urging the Toronto Stock Exchange to keep trading in its shares halted until after Freeport completed its due diligence study and Strathcona Minerals, Bre-X's independent consultant, finished an audit of earlier drilling results.</p>
<p>Bre-X also said it would review recent statements about the company and might consider legal action if warranted against those who, the company said, were spreading "misinformation".</p>
<p>On Thursday, panicked sellers slashed almost C$3 billion ($2.19 billion) off Bre-X's share price when the TSE ignored the company's initial request to postpone trading for several weeks, and re-opened trading late in the session.</p>
<p>The TSE on Thursday stood by its decision to resume trading in the stock, saying its task was to provide a continuous market in securities for investors. It said the audit could take many weeks to complete.</p>
<p>"The exchange does not believe that it is appropriate to deprive shareholders and investors of a market for such a lengthy period of time," the TSE said in a rare explanatory statement.</p>
<p>It appeared that the TSE planned to turn a deaf ear to Bre-X's latest request for a prolonged trading halt.</p>
<p>The exchange, Canada's biggest, said in a statement on Monday that it would resume trading in the stock on Tuesday after engineering firm Kilborn SNC-Lavalin issued a release.</p>
<p>The stock was halted all day on Monday. Bre-X closed at C$2.50 in Toronto last Thursday, down C$13.</p>
