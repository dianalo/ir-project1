<p>The proposed link between American Airlines and British Airways will stifle competition and should be rejected on antitrust grounds or drastically modified, rival airlines and a consumer group said Tuesday.</p>
<p>They told a Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee that the alliance would give American, a unit of AMR Corp., and British Airways Plc more than 60 percent of the rich trans-Atlantic market and squeeze out potential competition.</p>
<p>"The market power of the resulting combination would be such that it would be likely to raise airfares across the Atlantic by at least a half billion dollars a year," said Mark Cooper, research director of the Consumer Federation of America.</p>
<p>But Dave Schwarte, American's managing director of international affairs, defended the alliance, saying it gives American and British Airways no special advantage but only the benefits other U.S. carriers enjoy in their links with European carriers.</p>
<p>However, he faced a hostile committee.</p>
<p>Subcommittee Chairman Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican, said "the alliance differed from earlier agreements because it could affect the long-term viability of the U.S. airline industry, the preservation of competition in the London market and the security of the American consumer."</p>
<p>He added, however, it was not up to Congress to judge it, but for federal authorities to weigh.</p>
<p>"This merger is off the charts," said Sen. Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat. He asked antitrust officials to reject it.</p>
<p>The marketing alliance is under review by U.S. antitrust authorities and British and European competition agencies.</p>
<p>Even if the deal passes antitrust muster, the Clinton administration says it will not be approved until Washington and London reach an "open skies" aviation agreement ending the current restrictions on flights between the two countries.</p>
<p>Open skies talks have been under way for the past two years.</p>
<p>Schwarte called the alliance procompetitive because it would create a fourth global competitor, and it was this potential competition that prompted the opposition from other carriers.</p>
<p>Other alliances he referred to were United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., with Lufthansa; Northwest Airlines Corp. with KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, and Delta Air Lines Inc. with several smaller European carriers.</p>
<p>Schwarte rebutted concerns of other airlines, including Continental Airlines and Delta, that American and British Airways had a stranglehold on landing slots at London Heathrow airport and even with an "open skies" agreement, Heathrow would not be able to handle additional trans-Atlantic traffic.</p>
<p>He said American would be willing to give up 168 of its slots there, but the Consumer Federation's Cooper said this was not nearly enough to meet needs of rival airlines.</p>
<p>Cyril Murphy, United's vice president for international affairs, raised the idea of link being formed between American, British Airways and Japan Air Lines that could dominate global air travel.</p>
<p>He said American and British Airways would dominate traffic at Heathrow, the gateway to continental Europe, and Miami, gateway to Latin America, and that, once conditions permitted, American could form a link with JAL, which dominates Tokyo's key Narita airport.</p>
<p>"Absent effective government response, these three carriers will be able to forge an almost impregnable iron triangle, in which they would control access to international traffic between the world's major air transportation regions," Murphy said.</p>
