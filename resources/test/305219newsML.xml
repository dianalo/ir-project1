<p>UK stocks posted strong gains on Tuesday for the second day in a row, as fears of an imminent rise in UK interest rates subsided and tame U.S. inflation data reduced the pressure for a near-term U.S. interest rate rise.</p>
<p>Led by surging bank and supermarket stocks, the FTSE 100 finished 60.9 points higher at a record 4,168.2, adding 18.8 billion stg value to leading stocks over the last two sessions.</p>
<p>Gainers were in a three-to-one majority. The FTSE surpassed its previous intraday peak of 4,123.2 set on New Year's Eve in its biggest one-day gain since November 22, adding 110 points in two days.</p>
