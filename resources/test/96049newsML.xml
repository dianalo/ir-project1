<p>Cuba holds promising mining potential but economic growth has been hindered by U.S. sanctions against the island, Rupert Pennant-Rea director of Sherritt International told a conference on Friday.</p>
<p>"Once the biggest economic constraint was a domestic one, now it is an external one," he told the Global Emerging Markets Conference '96.</p>
<p>Cuba's government policies towards foreign investment were much more rleaxed than a decade ago, he said.</p>
<p>Currently about 2,000 foreign companies were doing business in Cuba.</p>
<p>Canada's Sherritt is one of the main foreign investors in Cuba targetted by U.S. sanctions. Its investments in Cuba estimated at more than US$200 million have made the company one of the most prominent investors on the island.</p>
<p>Pennant-Rea and other executives have been banned from entering the United States under the so-called Helms-Burton Law.</p>
<p>Pennant-Rea said Cuba's proximity to the United States represented a huge oppotunity for exports from the island and said the geography was favourable in its abundance of oil, gas and mining opportunities.</p>
<p>Sherritt has interests in oil and gas as well as a nickel operation in Cuba. The nickel property, a 50-50 joint venture with the government involves reserves of 60 million tonnes.</p>
<p>In 1994 Sherritt produced 13,000 tonnes and this year expects to produce 25,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Cuban government restrictions on land ownership and price setting on the local market still existed but the government has relaxed foreign currency restrictions and was moving towards a market-type economy.</p>
<p>The Helms-Burton Law seeks to tighten the long-standing U.S. economic embargo against Communist-ruled Cuba by penalising foreign companies and their executives who "traffic" in expropriated properties and asset in Cuba formerly owned by U.S. nationals or Cubans who later took U.S. citizenship.</p>
