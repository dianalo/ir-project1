<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Tuesday were seen $0.50 to $1.00 per cwt lower, pressured by outlooks for increased marketings and light packer demand, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota hog marketings Monday were estimated at 110,000 head, compared with 108,000 a week ago and 105,000 a year ago, USDA reported.</p>
<p>Marketings on Monday were active enough to provide at least one major packer in the interior Iowa/southern Minnesota area with enough hogs for Tuesday and provide a "good start" on Wednesday supplies, a packer hog buyer said.  </p>
<p>Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota top prices for hogs delivered to the plant were seen $0.50 lower at $57.00, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Illinois top hog prices at the plant were expected $0.50 lower at $56.00 and Indiana/Ohio top prices at the plant were seen down $1.00 at $56.00.</p>
<p>"We got enough hogs today to fill what light demand we had," one buyer in central Indiana said.</p>
<p>Expectations for increased hog supplies amid light to moderate pork demand also were seen pulling wholesale pork prices lower, the dealers said.</p>
<p>Fresh hams at midday were quoted steady to down $4.00 per cwt, pork bellies were steady to $2.00 higher and lean trimmings were down $1.00 in slow trading, USDA reported in its central U.S. carlot pork report.</p>
<p>There were 15.5 loads of pork cuts and 4.24 loads of trimmed and processed pork sold by midday.</p>
