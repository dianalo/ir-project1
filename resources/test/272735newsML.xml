<p>The dollar held fast in a narrow range in late European trading but was bid against the mark, dealers said.</p>
<p>No major moves are expected this side of the Christmas/New Year break and Tuesday's European session will end soon after midday with some European centres, though not London, closed.</p>
<p>U.S. personal income and spending both rose 0.5 percent in November with the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index at a final 96.9 in December versus November's final 99.2.</p>
<p>At 1710 GMT the dollar was trading at 1.5554/64 marks versus Friday's 1.5516/23. The range was 66 ticks.  </p>
<p>At this meeting they decided on a quarter point rise in base rates to 6.00 percent and comments from the minutes seemed to indicate that more rises are to come, dealers said.</p>
<p>Mark/Swiss franc was below an earlier three-year high at 86.07/10 after 86.24 and 85.91/94 on Friday.</p>
<p>London Forex desk +44-171-542-6284.  </p>
<p>Against the yen the dollar was at 114.05/15, barely changed from Friday's 114.15/25. The range was 49 ticks.</p>
<p>The next important U.S. data will not come until January 10 when the December employment report will be published.</p>
<p>Sterling gave up some of its earlier gains to a late $1.6710/20 and 2.5997/08 marks after highs of $1.6770 and 2.6033. It closed Friday at $1.6665/75 and 2.5879/90.</p>
<p>The pound was helped earlier by the minutes of the October 30 monthly monetary meeting between Bank of England Governor Eddie George and Chancellor of the Exchequer (Finance Minister) Kenneth Clarke.</p>
