<p>Canadian spot natural gas prices turned softer Wednesday, as additional field receipts began to arrive in Alberta, market sources said.</p>
<p>"A few more receipts are coming back on the system. Everything is starting to come together," one Calgary-based trader said, referring to the usual convergence in prices at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Spot gas at the AECO storage hub for Thursday delivery eased to about C$1.59-1.60 per gigajoule, down about three cents from Tuesday and off about 13 cents from week-ago levels.</p>
