<p>French firefighters gained control over forest fires near the Mediterranean port of Marseille on Sunday after a dip in winds that fanned the region's worst blazes in five years.</p>
<p>than 3,500 hectares (8,750 acres) of forest and scrubland in two days, scorning the efforts of about 2,000 firefighters backed by 350 fire engines and eight planes dumping water on the blazes.</p>
<p>Firefighters spent much of Sunday dousing the fringes of smouldering scrubland after the region's "mistral" wind calmed to about 30 kph (20 mph) from 100 kph (60 mph) on Saturday, when gusts lifted sparks high over fire breaks.</p>
<p>"The fire can be considered under control," a spokesman for the firefighters said. The only area where it was still a threat was along a northern fringe away from the city.</p>
<p>Many of the 2,000 people evacuated from the path of the fire returned home on Sunday. The blazes have licked at villages near Marseille including Plan-de-Cuques, Aubagne, Allauch and La Vesse, burning down or damaging dozens of homes.</p>
<p>Almost 500 people, most of them firefighters, have been treated for smoke inhalation or burns, 21 of them in hospital.</p>
<p>The original blaze erupted on Friday in a rubbish dump near a pine forest in Septemes-les-Vallons north of the city.</p>
<p>The public prosecutor in Aix-en-Provence launched a probe into the fire with investigators expressing suspicions that it started from illegal industrial waste.</p>
<p>And Philippe Nardin, head of the firefighters, complained that many of the secondary fires were arson. "Many of the fires that began at night had a criminal origin," he told France Info public radio.</p>
