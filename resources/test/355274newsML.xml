<p>A government proposal to end a months-long pay dispute in Italy's key engineering and metalworking industry was endorsed on Tuesday by all three trades unions in the sector.</p>
<p>A senior official of the FIOM union, the most sceptical of the three, said the proposed deal had been endorsed by a meeting of the union's leadership. The other two unions, FIM and UILM, approved the deal separately at meetings earlier on Tuesday.  </p>
<p>"It was approved by 66 votes...to 37 with 24 abstentions," Maurizio Zipponi, FIOM leader for the northern town of Brescia, said after the union meeting.</p>
<p>The employers' group Federmeccanica has yet to announce its position on the government's proposal, presented on Monday after all-night talks with the parties. Another meeting was expected to take place at the Labour Ministry on Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>UILM, FIM and FIOM represent 1.7 million workers in a sector which accounts for 40 percent of Italian industrial output. Their two-year contract expired in June.</p>
<p>The government has proposed extending the contract to 30 months. The employers would make a one-off payment of 512,000 lire ($316) paid in two instalments to cover the first six months, followed by graduated monthly wage increases totalling 200,000 lire ($124) during the rest of the contract.</p>
