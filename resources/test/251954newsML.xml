<p>Peru's state miner Centromin said Thursday it has postponed indefinitely the sale of its Yauricocha mine while it studies the possibility of selling the asset as a deposit instead of an operating unit.</p>
<p>"The idea is to take sufficient time. We're not worried simply about making a sale, but rather making a good sale," Centromin spokesman, Enrique Olivares, said.</p>
<p>Despite reducing the minimum bid price for the polymetallic mine to $8.5 million, down from an original $10 million, Centromin did not attract bidders for the planned December sale, he added.</p>
<p>Yauricocha, which lies 220 miles (350 km) southeast of Lima, currently produces 30,000 tonnes of mineral per month and has proven and probable reserves of 2.8 million tonnes and potential reserves of six million tonnes.</p>
<p>The failure to sell Yauricocha has been the one hiccup in Centromin's smooth sell-off program this year.</p>
<p>The next asset on the Centromin slate is the huge La Oroya complex of refineries and smelters scheduled for sale in late March. Under the provisional auction terms, the new owner of Centromin's largest asset would pay a small purchase fee to become the majority owner in a mixed company with the government and would then gradually receive more shares as the buyer injects fresh capital.</p>
<p>Following the La Oroya sale, Centromin hopes to set a date for the auction of a 100 percent stake in its San Cristobal and Andaychagua mines as one asset.</p>
<p>Since July, the state miner has come up with a variety of schemes allowing companies to take over its assets by winning auctions with either the highest purchase offer, the highest investment commitment bid or a combination of the two.</p>
<p>"Each asset is a little different and so you have to adapt to the particular needs of the market for each sale," Olivares said.</p>
<p>The government also plans to sell Centromin's remaining four mines, a railroad network, port facilities, four hydroelectric plants and several prospects by the middle of 1997.</p>
<p>The Centromin sales run parallel to the ongoing privatization of assets belonging to the government's second miner, Minero Peru.</p>
<p>While Centromin's sell-off program includes operating assets as well as deposits, Minero Peru is only selling deposits.</p>
