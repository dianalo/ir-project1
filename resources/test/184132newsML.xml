<p>Queensland deputy premier and State treasurer Joan Sheldon said on Tuesday that Queensland would not be following Victoria in transferring its industrial relations powers to the federal government.</p>
<p>"Queensland will not be handing its IR laws to the Federal Government," Sheldon told a Property Council of Australia meeting.</p>
<p>"We are not handing power to the feds," Sheldon said after delivering a speech to the meeting.</p>
<p>She said the Queensland state government expected to have its own industrial relations legislation in force by the end of the year.</p>
