<p>Turkish troops have killed 902 Kurdish separatist rebels in a four-day incursion into northern Iraq, the state-run Anatolian news agency said on Saturday.</p>
<p>It quoted sources at military headquarters as saying 141 Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) guerrillas had been captured. There was no independent confirmation of the figures.  </p>
<p>Pro-Kurdish MED-TV earlier dismissed the army's claims of heavy casualties among PKK fighters as grossly exaggerated but offered no figures of its own. It also said rebels had brought down a Turkish helicopter near the provincial capital Dohuk.</p>
<p>Journalists were barred from the operations zone by Turkish troops and their Iraqi Kurdish allies, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP). Communications with the remote region were also tightly restricted.</p>
<p>The Turkish sweep through Iraq, involving at least 10,000 troops and launched before dawn on Wednesday, has outraged the Iraqi government and caused alarm in Western capitals.</p>
<p>The European Union called on Turkey to pull its military forces out of Iraq as soon as possible and warned against any loss of civilian life. Its call followed tough talk from Britain and France, and lukewarm backing from close ally Washington.</p>
