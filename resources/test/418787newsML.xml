<p>British hotels and betting company Ladbroke Group Plc said on Tuesday it would close its property division, resulting in closure costs of 52.3 million pounds ($84.4 million) and a disposal charge of 17.6 million pounds in its 1996 accounts.</p>
<p>Ladbroke said it sold a portfolio of about 10 commercial and residential properties to Britain's Minerva Plc for 25 million pounds.  </p>
<p>"The closure of the property division will allow us to focus upon our core businesses of hotels and betting and gaming," Ladbroke finance director Brian Wallace said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ladbroke, which planned to close the unit's operations in Watford, southern England, and New York, said the net asset value of its commercial property was 373.4 million pounds ($602.7 million) at January 1, 1996 (corrects to add year.)</p>
<p>The properties sold to Minerva had a book value of about 34.6 million pounds and were mostly located in London and southern England.</p>
<p>Ladbroke said its property division also sold a stake in a Boston office building to HN Gorin Inc for $23.0 million in cash, which was about equal to book value.</p>
<p>The company said it expected to make a further U.S. property disposal this week for about $13 million and use the proceeds from the sales to pay down debt.</p>
<p>The carrying value of three remaining U.S. investment properties would be subject to a temporary writedown of 22.1 million stg, to be charged to the revaluation reserve in the group's 1996 accounts.</p>
<p>Ladbroke's shares slid 3.0 pence to 226 by 0832 GMT, while Minerva was up 1.5 pence to 156.</p>
