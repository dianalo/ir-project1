<p>Falling world metal prices have spooked Asian aluminium traders who said on Monday up to 80,000 tonnes of the metal was sitting in Chinese ports, having been ordered by consumers who now want to pay the lower prices.</p>
<p>"A lot of people have aluminium stuck in China," a trader based in Hong Kong with a European firm said.</p>
<p>"There's more than 80,000 tonnes that I know of," he said.</p>
<p>Another industry source in Hong Kong said 35,000 to 40,000 tonnes of aluminium was stuck in Hong Kong and the nearby south Chinese port of Shantou, having been destined for Chinese end-users who refused to pay for it.</p>
<p>Chinese trading companies have earned poor reputations in recent years for reneging on deals when world prices of the commodity they are buying fall between the date the order was placed and the date of its arrival.</p>
<p>Metal traders in Hong Kong and Beijing said they had been waiting for news of distressed cargoes as they watched prices fall.</p>
<p>Another trading source said figures of up to 80,000 tonnes of distressed aluminium were believable given the amount in Hong Kong and Shantou, as material was also being shipped to other ports such as Shanghai and Tianjin.</p>
<p>"People will stop selling to China until the price goes up again," he said. "And the price won't move up again until the LME (London Metal Exchange) stocks fall. There's just too much there."</p>
<p>On top of this has been a general slowdown in metals business to China, traders said. None polled by Reuters saw business improving before the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Latest LME figures show aluminium stocks at 961,450 tonnes. The LME's aluminium price has been hitting long-term lows in recent trading weeks.</p>
<p>Prices picked up from 2-1/2-year lows on Friday as news emerged that some Russian smelters were considering cutting production.</p>
<p>LME three-months aluminium ended at US$1,337 a tonne, not much different from Thursday but firmer than before the news and somewhat above a low hit on Thursday of $1,305.</p>
<p>A year ago, the price was $1,742.</p>
<p>"Some people are forecasting the price will move to $1,250," another Hong Kong trader said. But he added: "There is good support at the $1,300 level."</p>
<p>LME warehouses in Singapore had plenty of metal, he said, but it was commanding a premium over the LME cash price of $30 to $40, and ocean freight rates to China were $65 a tonne.</p>
<p>"This is the main problem -- no trader can afford it. No one can afford it," he said.</p>
<p>Chinese consumers were mostly buying hand-to-mouth, waiting for prices to reach rock-bottom, traders said.</p>
<p>"Once the price starts to move up again they will buy, because they will see the bottom has been hit," the European trader said.</p>
<p>Traders said world metals markets would probably spend the fourth quarter of 1996 defining a direction for 1997, when fundamentals should begin to play a role in firming the price.</p>
