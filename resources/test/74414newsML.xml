<p>The inaugural women's table</p>
<p>tennis World Cup, with prize money of $75,000, is poised to turn</p>
<p>into a lucrative benefit for double Olympic champion and world</p>
<p>number one Deng Yaping of China when it starts on Saturday.</p>
<p>Deng, nicknamed "Little Miss Dynamite" due to her explosive</p>
<p>style, heads a field missing three out of the top four ranked</p>
<p>players and she is strong favourite to capture the $22,000</p>
<p>winner's cheque.</p>
<p>Her doubles partner and world number two Qiao Hong,</p>
<p>Taiwan's' Chen Jing, who pushed Deng all the way in the singles</p>
<p>final at the Atlanta Olympics, and Chire Koyama of Japan all</p>
<p>declined invitations.</p>
<p>Adham Sharara, deputy president of the International Table</p>
<p>Tennis Federation, said the absence of several leading players</p>
<p>was disappointing.</p>
<p>"Chen Jing has television commitments in Taiwan and Chire</p>
<p>Koyama said before the Olympics that she would not be taking</p>
<p>part," he said. "I understand that Qiao is nearing retirement</p>
<p>from international events."</p>
<p>In the draw  made on Wednesday, Deng was matched with</p>
<p>European champion Jie Schopp of Germany, world number 10 Chan</p>
<p>Tan-lui of Hong Kong and Nigeria's Bose Kaffo, the African</p>
<p>champion, in the round-robin stage of the three-day event.</p>
