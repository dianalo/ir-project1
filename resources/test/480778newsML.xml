<text>
<p>Pen portraits of the 35-man British Lions squad to tour South Africa:</p>
<p>Full-backs:</p>
<p>Tim Stimpson (England) Age 23. Height 1.90m. Weight 98.5kg. Caps 5. Broke into the England team this season and is among five Newcastle players in the Lions party. Big, strong and quick, although kicking not a speciality.</p>
<p>Neil Jenkins (Wales) Age 25. 1.77m. 88.5kg. Caps 50. Named in the tour party despite breaking an arm against England in final match of five Nations season. Value as a goalkicker -- his Welsh record 534 points in 50 tests includes just six tries -- outweighs his relative inexperience at full-back.</p>
<p>Wings:</p>
<p>Ieuan Evans (Wales) Age 33. 1.78m. 84kg. Caps 71. (Lions 6 tests). Ever-present on the right wing in all six tests on his previous Lions tours to New Zealand and Australia and, injury-permitting, likely to extend that record in South Africa. Has suffered five dislocated shoulders, a broken ankle and a dislocated ankle but has still scored 33 test tries.</p>
<p>Tony Underwood (England) Age 28. 1.76m. 81kg. Caps 24. Was omitted from the initial 62-man squad but with fitness doubts over Simon Geoghegan has won a last-minbute place. His pace has never been in doubt but has done well to come back from a horrible afternoon opposite Jonah Lomu in the 1995 World Cup.</p>
<p>John Bentley (England) Age 30 (31 on May 9). 1.85m. 98kg. Caps 2. Won the last of his England caps nine years ago in Australia before switching to rugby league. Has now been picked ahead of several compatriots to beef up the Lions back division.</p>
<p>Nick Beal (England) Age 26. 1.88m. 87kg. Caps 1. Talented all-round player from the Northampton club where Lions coach Ian McGeechan is in charge. Was one of the few English successes on his debut against Argentina in December.</p>
<p>Centres:</p>
<p>Scott Gibbs (Wales) Age 26. 1.78m. 98.5kg. Caps 27. (Lions 2 tests). Part of the Lions test team in New Zealand, scoring a try in the final test in Auckland, before departing to rugby league with St. Helens in 1994. Returned to his former club Swansea in 1996 and his crash-tackling presence has played a big part in raising Welsh morale.</p>
<p>Allan Bateman (Wales) Age 32. 1.76m. 82.5kg. Caps 9. Despite the return of Gibbs, Jonathan Davies and Scott Quinnell, it is Bateman who many rate the most influential of all the ex-rugby league players within the Welsh squad. Intelligent, creative centre who was signed by Richmond after spell with Cronulla Sharks in Australia.</p>
<p>Jeremy Guscott (England) Age 31. 1.86m. 86.5kg. Caps 48. (Lions 5 tests). Virtually ignored by England coach Jack Rowell this season but Lions manager Fran Cotton still rates him as a huge talent. In absence of Will Carling and England captain Phil de Glanville, has chance to prove a major point.</p>
<p>Will Greenwood (England) Age 24. 1.93m. 95kg. Uncapped. The only non-capped player in the squad, picked on the strength of fine performances for Leicester under the command of former Wallaby coach Bob Dwyer. Exceptionally tall for a centre, his father Dick is a former England captain and coach.</p>
<p>Utility back:</p>
<p>Alan Tait (Scotland) Age 32 (33 on July 2). 1.83m. 89kg. Caps 10. If he wins a place in the test side, will become the first dual British union and league international in rugby history. Only returned to Scotland side in March after nine-year absence but has won Lions vote ahead of Jonathan Davies and Mike Catt.</p>
<p>Fly-halves:</p>
<p>Gregor Townsend (Scotland) Age 23 (24 on April 26). 1.83m. 88kg. Caps 25. Definitely not Mr Reliable, but potentially the key to the Lions' test hopes. Has played most of his rugby for Northampton and Scotland this season as a centre but coach McGeechan has long intended to use him at number 10. Missed the last World Cup through injury.</p>
<p>Paul Grayson (England) Age 25 (26 on May 30). 1.83m. 80kg. Caps 8. With doubts over Jenkins's fitness, the Lions decided they could not risk travelling without a second recognised goalkicker. Has been leading pointscorer in last two Five Nations seasons and scored 133 points in his eight tests.</p>
<p>Scrum-halves:</p>
<p>Rob Howley (Wales) Age 26. 1.76m. 82.5kg. Caps 16. His likely duel with Joost van der Westhuizen will be among the most fascinating of the tour. Has scored five tries for Wales and will be at the hub of Lions operations as was another Cardiff and Wales scrum-half, Gareth Edwards, in 1974. Represented Welsh schools at cricket at three separate age levels.</p>
<p>Austin Healey (England) Age 23. 1.78m. 85.5kg. Caps 2. A former wing who has leapfrogged a host of rivals to end the season as England's first-choice number 9. Confident character who claims never to have read a book in his life because he is so hyperactive.</p>
<p>Matt Dawson (England) Age 24. 1.80m. 78kg. Caps 5. Has recovered from knee surgery to beat compatriot Kyran Bracken and Scotland's Bryan Redpath to the third scrum-half spot. A versatile sportsman who has been picked at centre for England Under 21s and played soccer for Chelsea Boys.</p>
<p>Number eight:</p>
<p>Scott Quinnell (Wales) Age 24. 1.93m. 123.5kg. Caps 14. Departed for Wigan in a world record 400,000 pounds ($656,000) deal in September 1994 but returned to union last year. Follows in the footsteps of his father Derek who went on three Lions tours.</p>
<p>Eric Miller (Ireland) Age 21. 1.91m. 99kg. Caps 4. Virtually unknown at the start of the season, but has shot to prominence with Ireland and Leicester where he is now regularly preferred to Dean Richards. The youngest member of the Lions party but a potential member of the test team.</p>
<p>Flankers:</p>
<p>Richard Hill (England) Age 23 (24 on May 23). 1.91m. 101kg. Caps 4. Another virtual test certainty after less than a season of international rugby. Hard-working, tough performer in the mould of Peter Winterbottom, has impressed former Springbok captain Francois Pienaar since they teamed up at Saracens.</p>
<p>Neil Back (England) Age 28. 1.78m. 91kg. Caps 5. The most hotly-debated player in England, ignored by successive England coaches because of his modest height. Banned for six months after manhandling referee in Twickenham Cup final last year but is now one of six Leicester players in Lions party.</p>
<p>Lawrence Dallaglio (England) Age 24. 1.93m. 104kg. Caps 11. Expected to fill the blind-side slot in the test side and show the Springboks how far he has advanced since making his test debut against them as a replacement in 1995. A respected sevens player who rejected overtures by Italy to capitalise on his Italian parentage. Full name is Lawrence Bruno Nero Dallaglio.</p>
<p>Rob Wainwright (Scotland) Age 32. 1.94m. 98.5kg. Caps 28. Tipped as a probable Lions captain at the start of the season but Scotland's poor year has counted against him. An army doctor whose interests include falconry and whisky.</p>
<p>Utility forward:</p>
<p>Tim Rodber (England) Age 27. 1.98m. 114.5kg. Caps 31. Is still remembered in South Africa for his massive contribution to England's superb 32-15 win at Loftus Versfeld in 1994. Has struggled for consistency at times since but his extra lineout ability makes him a valuable Lions asset.</p>
<p>Locks:</p>
<p>Martin Johnson (England) Age 27. 2.01m. 116kg. Caps 30. (Lions 2 tests). A colossal figure at the heart of the England pack with few peers among the world's lock forwards. A Lion in 1993 after replacing Wade Dooley, he could have ended up representing New Zealand. Spent a season playing for King Country, the province of Colin Meads, and toured Australia with New Zealand Colts.</p>
<p>Simon Shaw (England) Age 24. 2.06m. 126kg. Caps 6. Nairobi-born and part-educated in Madrid, the massive Bristol player has made a remarkable recovery from a double dislocation and fracture of his left ankle against Northern Transvaal last season. Finally made his test debut against Italy last November.</p>
<p>Jeremy Davidson (Ireland) Age 22 (23 on April 28). 1.98m. 114kg. Caps 12. Started his international career at flanker but has switched to lock with conspicuous success in the past year. Born in Belfast, he had an excellent game against Australia late last year and usually wins more than his fair share of lineout ball.</p>
<p>Doddie Weir (Scotland) Age 26 (27 on July 4). 2.01m. 109kg. Caps 45. Another of Newcastle's Scottish connection, having moved south from Melrose last year. Is the only Scottish player to have scored two tries in the same test against the All Blacks.</p>
<p>Props:</p>
<p>Tom Smith (Scotland) Age 25. 1.77m. 108.5kg. Caps 3. Has catapulted up the front-row rankings to edge out Nick Popplewell, the only Irishman in the Lions test side in 1993. Picked for his mobility just two months after making his test debut at Twickenham.</p>
<p>Peter Clohessy (Ireland) Age 31. 1.80m. 102kg. Caps 16. Nicknamed 'The Claw', the uncompromising Clohessy is currently anchoring the Queensland pack in the Super 12 tournament. His Irish career had to be put on hold when he was suspended for 26 weeks for stamping on Olivier Roumat of France in 1996.</p>
<p>Jason Leonard (England) Age 28. 1.78m. 111kg. Caps 55. (Lions 2 tests). Became the youngest English player to reach 50 caps when he faced Italy this season. Played at tight-head for the Lions in New Zealand following a complicated neck injury which required a bone graft.</p>
<p>Graham Rowntree (England) Age 25 (26 on April 18). 1.83m. 111kg. Caps 14. Solid, unyielding member of the Leicester and England packs who is also tipped to become a Lions test regular. Rates his most embarrassing moment in rugby as diving over for a 'try' when still five metres short of the try-line in a club match against London Irish.</p>
<p>David Young (Wales) Age 29 (30 on June 27). 1.83m. 117.5kg. Caps 21. (Lions 3 tests). Referred to throughout rugby as Dai Young, he is one of only three survivors along with Evans and Guscott from the 1989 Lions tour to Australia. Spent six years in rugby league in the interim, captaining his country, but rejoined Cardiff last year.</p>
<p>Hookers:</p>
<p>Keith Wood (Ireland) Age 25. 1.83m. 101kg. Caps 8. Shoulder problems have prevented the all-action Wood from winning more caps, but when he plays is a handful for any team. Needed an operation on his left shoulder after injury against France in January. His father Gordon represented the Lions against New Zealand in 1959.</p>
<p>Mark Regan (England) Age 25. 1.81m. 101.5kg. Caps 12. Has gradually grown into the job as England's hooker since taking over from the long-serving Brian Moore. Nicknamed Ronnie by his team-mates.</p>
<p>Barry Williams (Wales) Age 23. 1.78m. 90kg. Caps 1. Tough character from Neath who scored a try within two minutes of his international debut against France in September. Picked ahead of Welsh captain Jonathan Humphreys.</p>
