<p>U.S. corporate bond dealers said the masses opted out of Tuesday's shortened session leaving prices to slide in sympathy with Treasuries.</p>
<p>High-yielders also posted no reaction to the dip in government security prices, traders there said.</p>
<p>Fixed-income markets faltered in thin trade after the commerce department reported 14.2 percent growth in new home sales for the month of November, analysts said. The Chicago Purchasing Managers index and consumer confidence data were also stronger-than-expected, an analyst said.</p>
<p>Treasury losses were exaggerated by low volume, some said.  </p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond closed down 1-9/32 at 98-4/32 to yield 6.64 percent.</p>
<p>PSA The Bond Market Trade Association has recommeded a 1400 EST/1900 GMT close for the U.S. fixed-income markets on Tuesday ahead of the New Year's Day holiday. All U.S. financial markets will be closed on Wednesday for the holiday.</p>
<p>The few corporate bond quotes that were made available reflected no movement in spread as Treasuries sold off.</p>
<p>"Corporates are not participating today," one high-grades trader said. "Anybody who is in may be doing year end stuff, tidying books etcetera."  </p>
<p>News that Circus Circus Enterprises Inc unveiled plans to construct a 4,000 room Las Vegas resort casino in 1997 came as no surprise in the debt markets and prices were flat.</p>
<p>Circus Circus shares fell 3/8 to 34-3/8 by midday.</p>
<p>Turning to the high-yield market, reliable quotes were hard to find due to thin staffing. Prices may be adjusted downward, however, once full-session trading resumes on Thursday, according to one trader.</p>
<p>No new corporate debt issues were priced in the investment grade or high-yield markets. Dealers expect a busy January.</p>
