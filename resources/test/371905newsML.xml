<p>The first shipment of processed rubber for years has sparked celebrations at Liberia's Firestone Plantations Co and boosted plans to rehabilitate one of the mainstay industries of the war-ravaged country.</p>
<p>"We exported the first 370,000 gallons of latex to France last week. It's a very symbolic occasion for us," Firestone's Managing Director Clyde Tabor told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>It was a modest figure for Firestone, a 100 percent unit of Nashville-based U.S. giant Bridgestone/Firestone Inc whose operations in Liberia are inter-twined with the history of the West African country founded by freed American slaves in 1847.</p>
<p>Before seven years of civil war shattered Liberia's economy and put to flight half the population and most foreign investors Firestone produced 200,000 pounds of dried rubber daily from 58,000 acres of plantations on concessions covering 240 square miles. The Liberia operation was established in 1926 and is the world's largest rubber plantation with 10 million trees.</p>
<p>Firestone was one of the bedrocks of Liberia's economy, with its own schools and utilities, employing 8,000 people including about 20 expatriate managers by the time civil war erupted in December 1989.</p>
<p>"We are now tapping about 20 percent of our farms," Tabor said. "We have access to a little bit more but we have to build housing and resettle staff and put people to work."</p>
<p>Firestone has managed to assemble 2,300 Liberian staff dispersed by civil war, plus a handful of foreign managers.</p>
<p>The company is due next week to restart the purchase of rubber from local farmers who were responsible for about 30 percent of Firestone's latex exports before the war.</p>
<p>Tabor expects Firestone to return to 1989 production levels sometime next year, but adds: "It depends on the country."</p>
<p>After several abortive attempts to settle the conflict a West African regional accord hammered out last August finally appears to be leading to peace and to elections planned for the end of May.</p>
<p>The African peacekeeping force policing Liberia since 1990 said this week it had practically completed disarmament of guerrillas and elections should be held as planned.</p>
<p>The United States which stepped up logistics support for the peacekeepers and the elections also announced plans to airlift more African troops to beef up the Nigerian-led ECOMOG force ahead of the elections.</p>
<p>U.S. ambassador William Milam hailed Firestone's return and said he would be encouraging other American companies to invest in Liberia once an elected government was in place and had demonstrated a willingness to pursue sound economic policies.</p>
<p>"Firestone is doing a terrific job and we are very pleased. I think their objective is to try and take better control, and of course that also depends on ECOMOG," Milam told Reuters.</p>
<p>The factory at Harbel, close to Monrovia's Robertfield International Airport, was ravaged twice by civil war -- in 1990, and again in 1992 shortly after production resumed following the first hit.</p>
<p>"They took out all the motors and everything they could sell," Tabor said of the looting by guerrillas.</p>
<p>The company hopes to take a major step towards normality by the end of April when it rehabilitates looted transmission lines to its own 4.5 megawatt hydro-electric power facility on the nearby Fammington river.</p>
<p>"We are now running the factory off generator power and that is far too expensive," Tabor said.</p>
<p>Parent company Bridgestone/Firestone is funding the entire rehabilitation programme estmated by Tabor at "tens of millions of dollars".</p>
<p>"This plantation has always had a good reputation for quality, so there is no problem for sales," he said. "The important thing for customers is continuity of supply. It looks like we've got there now."</p>
