<p>China's southern Guangdong province will not recommend real estate or financial firms for listing in the near future, the China Securities newspaper said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Guangdong securities regulators had issued a circular saying priority would be given to listing firms involved in energy, transport, telecommunications and raw materials, the paper said.</p>
<p>"Industrial processing enterprises, commercial distribution firms and sectors such as finance and real estate will temporarily not be considered," it said.</p>
<p>The newspaper did not say how long the policy, which is largely in line with central government statements, would remain in effect.</p>
<p>Local government authorities recommend companies to the central government as candidates for listing their shares. Companies that fail to gain the support of their local government are unable to go public.</p>
<p>China wants key industries such as energy and transport to have priority in tapping capital markets.</p>
<p>It also has been trying to limit investment in the speculative property market while it is concerned about losing control over financial firms by a reduction of state ownership.</p>
