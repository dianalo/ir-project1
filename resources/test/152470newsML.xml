<p>The worldwide market for semiconductors should grow 7.4 percent in 1997 to $138.8 billion and return to double-digit growth in 1998 and 1999, according to a forecast released by the Semiconductor Industry Association.</p>
<p>The SIA, a U.S. trade group also said worldwide semiconductor sales fell 10.5 percent in 1996, the most troubled year in the chip industry in nearly a decade.</p>
<p>Its World Semiconductor Trade Statistics research affiliate forecasts global chip sales will rise 17.1 percent in 1998 to $162.6 billion and 21.6 percent in 1999 to $197.6 billion.  </p>
<p>The organization also forecasts growth of 3.5 percent in this year's fourth quarter, a welcome reversal after declining sales all year.</p>
<p>"These growth rates overshadow the downturn the industry has witnessed this year. Following three consecutive quarters of declining sales, chip manufacturers should experience a 3.5 percent increase in sales during the fourth quarter of 1996," it said.</p>
<p>Overall, the WSTS sees 1996 sales of $129.2 billion, down from $144.4 billion in 1995.  </p>
<p>"This represents the first year of negative growth for the industry since 1985, when sales dropped by 30 percent," said Thomas Armstrong, president of the SIA.</p>
<p>"However, 1996 is merely a blip on the industry's phenomenal growth record when compared to the gut-wrenching slump of 1985," he said.</p>
<p>The group's forecast for 1999 would mean the industry will double in size in five years because two years ago, in 1994, worldwide chip sales were $101.8 billion. It had doubled between 1990 when worldwide sales were $50.5 billion and 1994.  </p>
<p>"Long term prospects for the chip industry are still excellent because the world has a ravenous appetite for the electronic equipment that relies on semiconductors. Over time, chips will become even more critical parts of the world economy than they are today," Armstrong said.</p>
<p>The industry's spectacular growth from 1993 to 1995 was interrupted by dramatic changes and steep price drops in the market for memory chips, or dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips. DRAM represents 19 percent of the world chip market. DRAM sales increased in 1995 by 74.4 percent to $40.8 billion, but fell 39.7 percent to $24.6 billion this year.  </p>
<p>The SIA said that, in 1997, the WSTS expects that total sales revenue for DRAMs will decline an additional 13.9 percent to $21.1 billion. The downward trend will reverse in 1998 and 1999, when DRAM sales should increase by 29.1 percent and 41.2 percent, respectively. The WSTS forecasts DRAM sales of $27.3 billion in 1998 and $38.6 billion in 1999.</p>
<p>Microprocessor sales have continued at a "blistering pace," the group said, even during 1996. Sales will expand 17.5 percent in 1996 to $16.7 billion, it said, then grow 22.9 percent in 1997 to $20.6 billion and 20.2 percent in 1998.</p>
