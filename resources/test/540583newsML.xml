<p>The European Commission said on Friday it had granted a three-year exemption from EU competition rules to two liner shipping agreements operating between ports in northern Europe and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>The first accord is called the Joint Operational Service Agreement and involves Andrew Weir Shipping Ltd, Iscont Lines Ltd, KNSM Kroonburgh BV and Zim Israel Navigation Ltd. It operates between Felixstowe, Antwerp, Rotterdam and Hamburg and the ports of Limassol, in Cyprus, and Ashdod and Haifa in Israel.</p>
<p>All but Iscont Lines are also part of the West Coast/Mediterranean Agreement which is active on the route between Liverpoool and Dublin and the ports of Lisbon, Leixoes, Malta, Palermo, Salerno, Limassol, Ashdod and Haifa.</p>
<p>Under a so-called block exemption to liner shipper consortia adopted in 1995, the Commission can give temporary clearance to shipping accords for the carriage of cargo chiefly by container if they benefit users and do not eliminate competition. The block exemption expires at the end of April 2000.</p>
