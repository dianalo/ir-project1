<p>South African police on Thursday arrested a fugitive white right-winger wanted for escaping from jail and for questioning over twin Christmas Eve bomb attacks that killed four blacks.</p>
<p>"We arrested fugitive Abraham Koper Myburgh early this morning on the west coast. At the time of his arrest he was in possession of an unlicenced 9mm pistol," West Cape police spokesman John Sterrenberg told Reuters.</p>
<p>He added Myburgh was being transported to Gauteng region centred on Johannesburg where he would appear on a charge of escaping from custody.</p>
<p>Myburgh had been on the run since March last year with two other escapees. All three men have now been apprehended.</p>
<p>They are among nine right-wingers convicted of murder last year for having planted bombs in and around Johannesburg that killed 20 people at the time of South Africa's first all-race election in April 1994.</p>
