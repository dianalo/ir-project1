<p>U.S. Midwest direct cash hog prices Thursday were seen steady to $1.00 per cwt lower, pressured by outlooks for large marketings following the New Years holiday on Wednesday, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Losses also were expected as packers bid lower to fend off weaker operating margins amid steep declines in pork cut-out values on Tuesday, they said.</p>
<p>Pork cut-out values were quoted down $0.92 to $1.19 per cwt, according to USDA. Declines in loins of $5.00 and butts of $6.00 overwhelmed $2.50 gains in pork bellies.  </p>
<p>Top prices for hogs delivered to the plant in Iowa and southern Minnesota could range $54.50 to $55.00.</p>
<p>Illinois hog buyers said top prices at the plant could range $54.00 to $54.50. Indiana/Ohio top plant hog prices could range $54.00 to $54.50.</p>
<p>Losses Thursday also were seen amid ideas that many packers were well supplied with live hog inventories and would not be aggressively chasing hogs, the livestock dealers said.</p>
