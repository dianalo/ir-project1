<p>Hungarian telecommunications company Matav confirmed on Friday it is planning a major flotation but an official declined to give the exact amount or say when the offering would be made.</p>
<p>"We have a very interesting plan and it will be a major IPO in the region," Geza Laszlo, chief economist of Investel, the financial subsidiary of MATAV, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Laszlo declined to confirm a report in the Financial Times that the amount of the IPO would be $500 million, saying "we haven't decided yet the percent to be sold".  </p>
<p>The newspaper said the flotation was expected within the next 18 months, but Laszlo said the date had yet to be set.</p>
<p>"We are going to be looking for the best timing," he said.</p>
<p>He said the flotation would affect holdings of the biggest investors in Matav, Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech, which together hold a 67 percent stake.</p>
<p>The sale would reduce their stakes but would not raise new capital for Matav, Laszlo said.</p>
<p>"They want to see what the market says about the price," Laszlo said. "They want to show that their investment was reasonable."  </p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom and Ameritech together bought 30 percent of Matav in 1993 for $850 million and purchased another 37 percent of the company in late 1995 for $852 million.</p>
<p>The Hungarian government holds a 25 percent stake with the remainder held by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, local governments and individual investors, Laszlo said.</p>
<p>Laszlo said four investment banks have been chosen to formulate plans for the sale, with a deadline of November 15 to submit proposals. They are CS First Boston, Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley.</p>
