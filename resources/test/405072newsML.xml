<p>A total 30,300 tonnes of current series white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 44.471 European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at Wednesday's European Union (EU) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board said.</p>
<p>Out of this, traders in France received 25,000 and in Germany 5,300 tonnes, it added.  </p>
<p>This week's award brings the cumulative tonnage awarded for export from the 1996/97 crop to 1.563 million tonnes. This compares with the 2,250 tonnes awarded on February 28, 1996, when the cumulative tonnage totalled 1.601 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, London traders had expected the subsidy for the current season whites campaign for licences to end-July to be 44.471 Ecus per 100 kilos, the exact amount awarded.</p>
<p>Traders had also forecast the total authorised sugar tonnage export awards to be between 20,000 and 60,000 tonnes versus 17,000 last week when the restitution was 44.008 Ecus.</p>
