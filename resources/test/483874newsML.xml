<p>European shares ended weaker on Thursday when Wall Street resumed its downward spiral, dominated by fears that higher U.S. interest rates may be just around the corner.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones average of leading U.S. shares was down some 50 points, at a three month low, when the European markets closed, having slid 94 points on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But trade was thin and nervous in Europe ahead of Friday's crucial U.S. March non-farm payrolls figures.</p>
<p>Dealers said any sign of strength in the data would boost expectations of further U.S. interest rate hikes after the U.S. Federal Reserve nudged rates higher last week.</p>
<p>Further rises in U.S. rates would be bad news for the world's stock markets as they could push Wall Street lower and have a knock-on effect elsewhere.</p>
<p>Economists surveyed by Reuters expected the U.S. unemployment rate to show a 0.1 percent drop and non-farm payrolls to rise by 182,000. The market will be particularly sensitive to any indication of upward wage pressures and a longer work week, dealers and economists said.</p>
<p>"No one wants to be heroic ahead of the (U.S. jobs) data," a share trader in London said, summing up the mood on Europe's bourses.</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100 suffered an early markdown in the wake of the Dow's drop overnight but later pared its losses as the opposition Labour Party's election manifesto failed to spring any unpleasant surprises, dealers said. The index ended 22 points, or 0.5 percent, lower.</p>
<p>Labour, apparently well placed to win the May 1 election, pledged to match current targets for 2.5 percent or less inflation, to leave income tax rates unchanged and to stick to the Conservative government's existing public spending plans for the next two years.</p>
<p>British utility shares climbed as investors looked to defensive stocks in a depressed market, analysts said.</p>
<p>German shares fell slightly in post-bourse electronic IBIS trade as the Dow opened lower but pared losses to end the day up 1.88 points at 3,212.82.</p>
<p>Earlier the DAX index of bourse trade ended down 86.67 points, or 2.62 percent, at 3,215.24 after sliding on the back of Wednesday's losses in electronic trade.</p>
<p>"There is very little cash business out there at the moment -- it's all futures driven. There are no real inflows and I don't imagine any real inflows until the important U.S. data comes out tomorrow," a broker said.</p>
<p>Another dealer added: "There is bargain-hunting going on, with people using the lower levels to start buying. I think the index could keep going down and people will keep taking up bargains."</p>
<p>The Bundesbank's policy-making council met but left interest rates unchanged, as economists had expected.</p>
<p>French stocks fell for the third consecutive session, pressured by the dollar's weakness, Wall Street's retreat and lower bond prices.</p>
<p>Traders said the market was cautious ahead of the U.S. jobs report. They said investors would pay close attention to average hourly wages for signs of any pickup in U.S. inflation.</p>
<p>The blue chip CAC-40 index finished down 15.76 points, or 0.62 percent, at 2,514.52.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, the Dutch, Spanish and Italian bourses posted losses of 0.9, 0.5 and 0.3 percent, respectively, though Swedish shares rose almost 0.4 percent on bargain-hunting after two days of steep falls.</p>
<p>In currencies, the dollar ended European trading weaker against the mark after new German data surprised the market with its strength.</p>
<p>German industrial production rose 1.9 percent month-on-month in February for a year-on-year jump of 7.1 percent, igniting a mark rally which was fuelled by 6.2 percent yearly growth in pan-German industry orders.</p>
<p>"It's all to do with the data we've seen today -- they're certainly on the strong side, especially at face value," said Joanne Collins, senior market strategist at Nomura International in London.</p>
<p>Concern over trade tensions between the United States and Japan continued to weigh on the dollar/yen rate, which ended around 122.63, a touch down from Wednesday's close.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin holds talks with Japan's prime minister and finance minister in Tokyo on Friday, having already spooked the dollar by warning Japan not to let its huge trade surplus swell again.</p>
<p>But he denied he was trying to trigger currency movements and analysts said the market was now calmer about the outcome of the meetings.</p>
<p>"Expectations of a heavy-handed approach by Rubin ... are looking likely to be disappointed, particularly in reference to exchange rates," said Tim Fox, treasury economist at Standard Chartered in London.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1545 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.6673 marks and 122.63 yen, compared with 1.6713 and 122.70 in late European trade on Wednesday.</p>
