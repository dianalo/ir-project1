<p>IPE Brent futures trundled along at slightly lower levels on Monday as the market consolidated Friday's gains in a thin holiday market, brokers said.</p>
<p>July Brent was eight cents lower at $20.27 a barrel, while June gas oil was $4.50 up at $177.50 a tonne at 1459 GMT.</p>
<p>Brokers attributed the modest losses to consolidation following July Brent's 86 cent gain on Friday, and many said the fact the contract had held well above $20 was a positive sign.</p>
<p>Some looked for greater volume to confirm the gains but with many European players away from the market due to public holidays, that appeared unlikely.</p>
<p>Gas oil was stronger as it played catch-up with the Brent gains as well as strength in NYMEX heating oil at the end of last week.</p>
<p>"It's being helped by the fact that Brent's remained relatively strong," said one broker.</p>
<p>"It's very quiet. There's hardly any paper out there and I"m expecting it to drift off a bit it's just a question of when it will start doing so," the trader added.</p>
