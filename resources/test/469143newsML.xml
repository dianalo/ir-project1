<p>A Brazilian judge ruled against compensation for a man who broke the little finger of his left hand in a work accident, arguing the finger was "not of much use", a newspaper said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Judge Edmundo Lellis Filho rejected a request by lawyers of Valdir Martins Pozza who demanded their client receive a monthly lifetime compensation equivalent to 30 percent of his salary at the time of the accident, Folha de Sao Paulo said .</p>
<p>In his ruling the judge said it was not a demonstrated fact that the man's working ability had been diminished.</p>
<p>"The damaged finger ... is not of much use to the rest of the hand and several anthropologists consider it a mere appendix that will disappear as the human species evolve," the ruling said.</p>
<p>The newspaper said plaintiff's lawyers would appeal the sentence.</p>
