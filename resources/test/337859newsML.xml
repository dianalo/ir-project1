<p>A White House order on intergovernmental relations has become a key part of negotiations between U.S. regulators and states and localities on how to deal with yield burning, knowledgeable sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The order was discussed at a high-level meeting at the U.S. Treasury Department on January 27, the sources said. The hour-and-a-half session was attended by Donald Lubick, Treasury's assistant secretary for tax policy, and over a half-dozen state and local government groups.</p>
<p>Officials with Treasury declined to comment.</p>
<p>Yield burning refers to allegations that bond underwriters overcharge issuers for U.S. Treasuries bought in the open market and used in municipal bond refinancing deals.</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Service, an arm of Treasury, last year shocked localities by announcing that they can avoid having interest on bonds declared taxable if they pay Treasury the difference between the price they paid and the spot price of the securities on purchase date, plus interst.</p>
<p>Attendees at Monday's meeting urged Treasury to drop last year's pronouncement and work with states and localities on a procedure that does not require expensive due diligence from issuers nationwide, spokesmen for the groups said yesterday.</p>
<p>Sources said Tuesday that making use of the President's Executive Order 12875 called "Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership" was a key mechanism discussed at the clossed session.</p>
<p>Released in October 1993, the order, entitled Enhancing the Intergovernmental Partnership, says local governments should have more flexibility to design solutions to nationwide problems without "excessive micromanagement and unnecessary regulation from the Federal Government."</p>
<p>The order requires federal agencies to inform the Office of Management and Budget, before promulgating a standard, about how much it consulted with state and local governments on the issue.</p>
<p>The executive order says agencies must consider applications for waivers from the rule from localities that have different but effective solutions to a problem. Agencies have 120 days to rule on any waiver request, the order says.</p>
<p>State and local government officials at Monday's meeting expressed a desire to work with Treasury on yield burning and Treasury indicated it wanted to work with state and local governments on a solution to the problem, the sources said.</p>
