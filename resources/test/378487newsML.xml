<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission Friday filed a complaint against the former chief executive officer of Centennial Technologies, Inc, charging him with insider trading, altering inventory and fraud.</p>
<p>Emanuel Pinez, who was fired by the Billerica-based computer card maker on Tuesday, allegedly bought 1,955 "put" option contracts, and sold about 2,400 "call" option contracts on Centennial stock, the SEC said in its complaint.  </p>
<p>The SEC alleged that Pinez, an Israeli citizen who maintains homes in Canada and Switzerland as well as Massachusetts, aware of "material, nonpublic information regarding Centennial" began buying the options that expire on March 21 last Friday.</p>
<p>The minimum profit Pinez would make will be $447,500 in premiums he has received from the call options.</p>
<p>"It's impossible to say right now how much his profit will be on the put options," SEC District Administrator Juan Marcel Marcelino said in a telephone interview.  </p>
<p>Pinez calculated that, prior to the options' expiration, Centennial's stock would decrease substantially in price, the SEC said. Indeed, last year's best performing New York Stock Exchange issue which was trading in the upper 50s at year's end, Centennial closed at 16-3/8 on Monday.</p>
<p>The stock exchange halted trading on Tuesday and analysts expected that when and if trading resumes, Centennial shares will open in the single-digits.</p>
<p>Federal Magistrate Lawrence Cohen ordered Pinez detained at Friday's arraignment in Boston's U.S. District Court and set Feb 18 for a hearing. He also ordered Pinez's assets frozen.  </p>
<p>The 58-year-old Pinez also acknowledged at the Feb 10 board meeting, where he was subsequently fired, that on a number of contracts for inventory dating back to at least the quarter ending June 30, 1996, customers were invoiced for goods even though he himself had advanced his personal money to the customers to enable them to buy the goods, the U.S. attorney's office said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to two brokerage firms at which Pinez maintained accounts, he borrowed more than $15 million "on margin," that is based on the market value of stock in his account, the statement said.</p>
<p>If convicted, Pinez faces up to five years in prison and $5,000 fine on each count of securities fruad as well as restitution.</p>
<p>Investigators said the probe is continuing.</p>
