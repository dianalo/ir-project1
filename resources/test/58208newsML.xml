<p>Argentina's main opposition force, the Radical Party, was still uncertain Tuesday whether it would help muster a congressional quorum to discuss a tax-increase package proposed by President Carlos Menem.</p>
<p>Radical chief Rodolfo Terragno said over the weekend the party would contribute to a quorum for discussions on Wednesday, paving the way for approval of the measures in Congress, where the Peronist Party in power has a majority in both houses.  </p>
<p>But Radical Party Vice-President Melchor Posee Tuesday said his party would only show up for the lower house session if the Peronists could reach a quorum of their own.</p>
<p>"We consider Radicals can only go and debate and argue against, as they should, when those who advocate the package have mustered the necessary quorum," he told a radio station.</p>
<p>He added Radical officials and lawmakers would make a final decision later Tuesday.</p>
<p>The government's package includes fuel and income tax increases, which the government considers necessary to close a fiscal gap of about $6.6 billion this year.  </p>
<p>A first attempt at discussing the proposal failed last Wednesday when opposition lawmakers and 14 Peronist Party deputies boycotted the session.</p>
<p>Carlos "Chacho" Alvarez, leader of the Frepaso coalition, the second opposition grouping, on Sunday indicated that his deputies would show up this time around, saying legislators "should not abuse their right" to stay away from sessions.</p>
