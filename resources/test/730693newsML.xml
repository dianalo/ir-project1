<p>Rural merchandising group IAMA Ltd, rejecting speculation that dry weather had hit the group, said on Tuesday trading in its third financial quarter had been above budget.</p>
<p>"That quarter to the end of June was above budget," IAMA managing director Danny Bourke told a Securities Institute function.</p>
<p>He also said the group was hoping to boost sales in the current year ending September 30 to more than A$900 million.</p>
<p>In the previous 1995/96 year, the group posted a net profit of A$15.5 million on sales of A$787 million.  </p>
<p>Bourke said the group relied largely on selling inputs such as fertiliser, machinery and animal drugs to farmers and these were largely unaffected by drought.</p>
<p>"The message that I'm on about is that our business is in inputs and regardless of the outputs, our business relies on inputs, and that trend has been up all along," he said.  </p>
<p>At 0420 GMT (2.20 p.m.), IAMA shares were trading at A$2.85, down one cent on Monday's close.</p>
