<p>John du Pont's wealth failed to stop him from becoming probably the richest American ever convicted of murder, but it helped make his case for avoiding a life sentence and could ease his time in jail.</p>
<p>Experts and attorneys in the case said du Pont's fortune, estimated at up to $250 million, enabled him to hire the best lawyers and a "dream team" of courtroom psychiatrists, who can continue to help him as his case goes to sentencing.</p>
<p>But the wealth of a man who witnesses said once boasted he could get away with a hypothetical murder also may have created a mental obstacle for the jury to overcome in deciding on a lesser verdict than first-degree murder, they said.</p>
<p>Du Pont, 58, an heir to the chemical fortune built by his great-great grandfather, E.I. du Pont, was found guilty of third-degree murder but mentally ill on Tuesday in the January 1996 killing of Olympic champion wrestler David Schultz.</p>
<p>He faces between five and 40 years in prison.</p>
<p>"Money can't hurt. It buys things," Temple University law professor Ed Ohlbaum said. "It ultimately allowed him to afford a top-flight lawyer who put together a defence team including top-flight psychiatrists."</p>
<p>However, Ohlbaum said, the millions of dollars spent by du Pont only served to match high-level talent assembled by prosecutors, who normally can far outspend a criminal defendant of lesser means.</p>
<p>"The money merely leveled the playing field," he said.</p>
<p>In its verdict, the state court jury in Media, Pennsylvania, rejected the prosecution's argument du Pont was guilty of first-degree murder, which carries an automatic life sentence, and the defence plea that he was innocent by reason of insanity.</p>
<p>Also rejected was a verdict of voluntary manslaughter.</p>
<p>Under the definition of third-degree murder, a killer must act with malice, but without a premeditated intent to kill.</p>
<p>Psychiatrists hired by du Pont had argued, apparently convincingly, that although du Pont had aimed his .44 calibre handgun at Schultz and shot him three times, the killing was the result of a sudden "crystallization" of thought in a mind beset by paranoid schizophrenia, and was not premeditated.</p>
<p>Du Pont had spent $2 million on his defence by the end of last summer, but his lawyers declined to give a figure on Tuesday for the total cost.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said during the trial they had spent less than $500,000, but they had not estimated a final figure and were planning to recover costs from du Pont.</p>
<p>Du Pont's attorney Taras Wochok said his wealth may have been a negative factor in jurors' minds during the case.</p>
<p>"I would have to say that wealth had to be something of a factor ... that has certainly become a concern by the general public, a concern that those with wealth can avoid responsibility," he told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The mental illness provision of the verdict lets du Pont obtain treatment before serving the rest of any sentence in prison -- a hearing is to be held on the need for treatment in conjunction with his sentencing hearing April 22.</p>
<p>Wochok said he was content for the time being to allow du Pont to remain in a state mental hospital, but he did not rule out seeking court approval for private treatment.</p>
<p>Delaware County District Attorney Patrick Meehan, who called du Pont "the wealthiest murder defendant in the history of the United States" said on Tuesday the verdict was "a vindication for the criminal justice system which holds all people as equal before the law."</p>
<p>But he also said it was a tragedy that, despite du Pont's wealth, he failed to get mental treatment earlier.</p>
<p>"We saw a tremendous amount of resources, particularly of the psychiatric nature, available to this man ... and it's tragic that there was not some sort of intervention before the killing of David Schultz, because in the criminal justice system you're left to try to pick up the pieces."</p>
