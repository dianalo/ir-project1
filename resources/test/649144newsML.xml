<p>Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus rejected on Tuesday a key member of parliament's demand that the house get votes on key bank and utility privatisations as a condition for supporting the cabinet in a confidence vote.</p>
<p>Klaus told the chamber that the cabinet would inform the lower house of its privatisation decisions, but that the selloffs were "an act of an executive type" and "not a task" for parliament.  </p>
<p>Klaus earlier on Tuesday called for a vote of confidence in his embattled cabinet and its programme aimed at answering an economic downturn and crisis in confidence in the Czech crown.</p>
<p>Independent parliamentary deputy Jozef Wagner, who may be key to the government winning in a confidence vote, said on Tuesday he would support the cabinet if it allows the lower house to decide on key banking and utility privatisations.</p>
<p>He said that as a condition for his support of the cabinet it was up to Klaus to proclaim that it would be the lower house which "decides on the concept of the potential privatisation of infrastructure and banks".</p>
<p>Wagner rejected opposition claims that the government's planned privatisations of key banks and energy distributors should be kept in Czech hands, and said the country should look abroad for capital and know-how.</p>
<p>But he said that the house should be allowed a vote on the questions.</p>
<p>Wagner is the chairman of the house budget committee who was expelled from the opposition Social Democrats after he voted with the government and gave Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus a narrow victory in approving the 1997 budget late last year.</p>
<p>Analysts expect at least 97 opposition deputies to vote against the government, but the votes of the two unaffiliated deputies are still not clear and one deputy from the Communist party has said he is unable to vote for health reasons.</p>
<p>The finance ministry last week announced plans to sell off key stakes in two of the largest commerical banks Komercni Banka a.s. and Ceskoslovenska Obchodni Banka a.s. and in 18 gas and electricity distributors.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Czech post-Communist transformation earlier this decade, parliament granted final say over privatisation decisions to the cabinet.</p>
