<p>Bombay shares ended off their day's highs on Friday as a strong rally lost some steam when speculators booked profits near close, traders said.</p>
<p>Bombay's benchmark stocks index -- which hit a 1997 high of 4065 points in afternoon trade -- ended 41.23 points higher at 4024.18 as wary speculators unwound positions ahead of a possible oil price hike this weekend.</p>
<p>The decision-making panel of India's ruling United Front has not yet agreed on whether to meet on June 15 to take a decision on oil prices, a United Front spokesman said on Friday.</p>
<p>"There is no decision yet on holding the meeting on Sunday," spokesman Jaipal Reddy told Reuters. "I cannot say it will be held."  </p>
<p>Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral and Finance Minister P. Chidambaram have said they favour increases in petroleum product prices, while left parties in the coalition want alternatives to be considered.</p>
<p>A decision has been deferred several times already and a meeting was earlier scheduled for Sunday.</p>
<p>Traders said foreign funds and speculators were buyers in frontliners like ITC, MTNL, Tata Tea and TELCO.</p>
<p>"It's been a mix of fund buying and local players also jumping along," said Maulik Sharedalal, a member-broker of the Bombay bourse.  </p>
<p>Profit-booking towards close pared gains, traders said.</p>
<p>"Some selling from local insitutions and squaring off from speculators on the last day of the account drove prices lower towards the end of the session," said a trader at a foreign brokerage.</p>
<p>Shares of Reliance Industries bucked the uptrend and closed 4.0 rupees lower at 319.50.</p>
<p>Rumours bubbled about a possible bonus share announcement by the firm ahead of its annual shareholders meeting on June 26.</p>
<p>The speculation has been around since chairman Dhirubhai Ambani hinted at the firm's last shareholders' meeting that a bonus issue could be forthcoming, analysts said.</p>
<p>Reliance shares have jumped nearly 60 percent in 1997, favoured by massive capacity additions, high exposure to India's demand growth and increasing ventures in the oil, power and telecoms sectors.</p>
<p>"There has been a sharp run-up in the stock in the last fortnight. Action has temporarily shifted to other topline stocks," one dealer said.</p>
