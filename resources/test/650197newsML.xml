<p>Ministers from burned churches expressed their concern to top Clinton administration officials Tuesday that a government report into the recent wave of fires sends the wrong message.</p>
<p>Participants at the nearly two-hour meeting at the Justice Department said the ministers also voiced other concerns about the federal loan guarantee programme to help rebuild the churches and the way some arson investigations have been handled.</p>
<p>Before meeting with Vice President Al Gore, Attorney General Janet Reno and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, some pastors from South Carolina released a statement criticising the report's finding of no evidence of a national conspiracy.</p>
<p>"Your determination sends a message to white supremacists, organised and unorganized, and all individuals who subscribe to the white supremacy ideology, that it is okay to burn down black and multiracial churches," they said.</p>
<p>The pastors said the report failed to adequately discuss the role white juveniles have played in the church burnings, and listed five areas the government should address now.</p>
<p>The report, released Sunday, said authorities have investigated 429 incidents of arson, bombings and attempted bombings at churches -- mainly black houses of worship -- since January 1995.</p>
<p>A special task force created in June 1996 said in its first year's report that 199 persons were arrested. Prosecutors convicted 110 defendants involved in 77 fires.</p>
<p>At a Justice Department news conference after the meeting, the Rev. Joan Brown Campbell from the National Council of Churches said the pastors from South Carolina do not speak for all of the 60 ministers who attended.</p>
<p>But she acknowledged sharing some of their concerns, especially that the report does not make strong enough a case that the burnings had been linked to racial hostility.</p>
<p>The report said the burnings "were motivated by a wide array of factors including not only blatant racism or religious hatred, but also financial profit, burglary and personal revenge."</p>
<p>Campbell told reporters the $10 million earmarked in federal loan guarantees was not enough to rebuild all the burnt churches, and that some pastors had been upset by the treatment from bankers in applying for the loans.</p>
<p>"In considering the loan, the process itself is very unfriendly or unaccommodating," a group of pastors complained.</p>
<p>Campbell also said some ministers remained concerned about how the investigations have been conducted. "They are themselves suspected," she said. "Local law enforcement people sometime come to this with very prejudiced minds."</p>
<p>In brief remarks, Gore hailed the number of arrests, but added, "Our work is not done" in prosecuting arsonists, rebuilding churches and preventing future attacks.</p>
