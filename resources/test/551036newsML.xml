<p>The French Finance Ministry said on Wednesday that it was suspending the planned privatisation of the Societe Francaise de Production after a consortium withdrew its bid for the loss-making film and television studios.</p>
<p>"The government, fully aware of the firm's situation, believes that SFP's privatisation remains the sole option able to assure its survival and the survival of its abilities," the ministry said in a statement.</p>
<p>The ministry said that it would now ask SFP management to evaluate the firm's situation and prepare recommendations on what to do next.  </p>
<p>"The government has informed the European Commission in Brussels of the suspension of the privatisation process and has assured it of its willingness to fully cooperate with the European authorities in order to come up with a satisfactory solution," the ministry said in its statement.</p>
<p>It added that all offers made as part of the proceeding were now invalid.</p>
<p>The French government announced in late December 1996 that it planned to sell SFP to a consortium of Generale des Eaux and Havas.</p>
<p>The loss-making Societe Francaise de Production studios produce live coverage of events for French television and also make television programmes and films.</p>
<p>The government had also said it intended to inject up to 1.2 billion francs into SFP as part of the privatisation, and it said it expected the transaction to be completed before the end of this year.</p>
<p>All bidders for the studios had demanded a capital injection in exchange for a pledge to maintain jobs.</p>
