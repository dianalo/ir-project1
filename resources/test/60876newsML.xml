<p>Ireland tight-head prop Peter Clohessy said on Wednesday he had signed a five month contract with the Queensland Rugby Union in Australia.</p>
<p>Clohessy, 30, who has won 16 caps, will travel to Australia early next year.</p>
<p>He has been suspended until the end of November after a stamping incident in the Five Nations' match against France in February.</p>
<p>"I feel that if I did not go, I might subsequently regret it. I have great respect for Queensland coach John Connolly and look forward to playing under him," Clohessy said.  </p>
<p>"I feel it will do me good to start again in a new environment. It has been hard to be out of the game since last February but I must put that behind me."</p>
