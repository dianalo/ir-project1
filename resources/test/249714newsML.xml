<p>European Union farm experts remain split over plans to change the rules for exceeding base areas for planting cereals, an EU official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The special agriculture committee failed to resolve the differences over this despite a long discussion on Tuesday," the official said.</p>
<p>Germany has proposed that the present regulation should be amended to allow penalties for overshooting of base areas to be applied to those regions or states responsible.</p>
<p>"The German Laender (states) want the change because not all have been responsible for the national overshoot in the past," the official added.</p>
<p>The penalty for exceeding permitted base areas is a one percent cut in the following season for every one percent of overplanting.</p>
<p>But other member states, notably France, Italy, Portugal and Ireland, presented what the official described as "a shopping list of demands aimed at letting their farmers escape penalties."</p>
