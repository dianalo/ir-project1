<headline>Nippon Credit denies report over loan guarantee.</headline>

<p>Nippon Credit Bank Ltd on Wednesday denied a newspaper report that it had guaranteed loans which its financially troubled non-bank unit provided to agricultural financial institutions.</p>
<p>A bank spokesman said that while the bank had given a written statement to the institutions, this meant the bank would continue to support the restructuring of the non-bank affiliate, Crown Leasing Corp.</p>
<p>"It did not mean guarantees on the loans," he said.</p>
<p>The Asahi Shimbun reported on Wednesday that the bank had issued a statement to the agricultural financial institutions which had extended loans totalling 240 billion yen to Crown Leasing.  </p>
<p>The newspaper said Nippon Credit wrote that it would take responsibility for the unit's management, which the agricultural financial institutions regarded as a pledge the bank would cover any losses if the unit could not repay the loans.</p>
<p>Nippon Credit itself extended loans of about 120 billion yen to Crown Leasing, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>The spokesman said Crown Leasing is undergoing a second round of a restructuring programme worked out in 1994.</p>
<p>Nippon Credit's attitude towards all creditors of the unit is "equal and uniform", he said.  </p>
<p>The spokesman said the restructuring programme was going smoothly and that there were no signs that Crown Leasing's operations had deteriorated recently.</p>
<p>Analysts said Nippon Credit has three related non-bank financial institutions, including Cown Leasing, which have been facing asset quality problems since expanding their lending to the real estate sector during the late 1980s "bubble economy" of inflated asset prices.</p>
<p>The total debt of the three non-banks is now about 2.3 trillion yen, including Crown Leasing's debt of about 1.1 trillion yen, they said.</p>
