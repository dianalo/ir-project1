<p>Jacques Villeneuve was hit by a suspended one race ban just hours after victory in the British Grand Prix on Sunday had revived his world title challenge.</p>
<p>The punishment, for failing to maintain the correct distance behind the safety car early in the race, is unlikely to diminish his delight at closing the gap on championship leader Michael Schumacher of Germany.</p>
<p>If the Canadian keeps out of trouble at the German Grand Prix in two weeks the ban will be expunged from his record.</p>
<p>Villeneuve was also in trouble with Formula One authorities last month. He was reprimanded for criticising rule changes due to be introduced next season. He was involved in further controversy in France two weeks later over comments suggesting Formula One was "too politically correct" and that drivers were insincere over their expressed feelings for injured driver Olivier Panis.</p>
<p>Villeneuve's win, which secured the Williams team their long-awaited 100th Formula One victory on the circuit where they claimed their first in 1979, cut Schumacher's lead to four points in the drivers' title battle after nine of this year's 17 races.</p>
<p>Schumacher, who was forced to retire his Ferrari with mechanical problems after leading, now has 47 points to Villeneuve's 43. The Canadian has a good chance of living up to his pre-season status as favourite for the drivers' title if he and Williams can maintain their form.</p>
<p>"It was a very important victory, definitely, for all of us," said Villeneuve. "But I was worred after that pit-stop because I had lost so much time. After that I just had to push, push and push all the time.</p>
<p>"I was lucky the tyres were very good for me and I could push so hard. It was good for me too to see Michael (Schumacher) stop because it is time they had some problems this year!"</p>
<p>Villeneuve's win was his second in succession at Silverstone, his fourth this season and the eighth of his career. It was also the seventh in succession at the British Grand Prix by a Renault-powered car and Williams' sixth in the last seven years.</p>
<p>But Villeneuve, whose hopes appeared to have been wrecked when he suffered a near-catastrophic 33-second first pit stop after leading the opening 22 laps, was helped by the misfortunes of two chief rivals in a race of swinging fortunes for all the leading drivers.</p>
<p>Both subsequent leaders, Schumacher and Finland's Mika Hakkinen, were forced to retire due to mechanical problems just when it seemed they were capable of claiming victory. For Hakkinen, it was particularly cruel as he has never won a Formula One race in 88 attempts.</p>
<p>Schumacher had opened up a 42-second lead before being forced out after his second pit-stop after 37 laps with what appeared to be a rear suspension problem.</p>
<p>Hakkinen led for eight laps near the end, holding off Villeneuve's challenge, before his McLaren's Mercedes-Benz engine blew. He threw his gloves into the crowd after banging his fists on his steering wheel in frustration.</p>
<p>"Towards the end of the race, I blistered a tyre which allowed Villeneuve to catch me, but I had everything in control," said Hakkinen. "There was no way he could have got past me.</p>
<p>"Then my engine went -- it means I have really experienced every emotion this weekend."</p>
<p>Schumacher, however, owed his opportunity to lead only to the loose front left wheel problem which upset Villeneuve's first pit-stop after he had led the opening 22 laps from pole position.</p>
<p>It required 33.6 seconds to rectify before he could rejoin the race. When he eventually re-entered the fray, Villeneuve was seventh and had to fight his way back through the field, making the most of every opportunity, to win.</p>
<p>The departures of Schumacher and Hakkinen followed the first lap retirement of Villeneuve's Williams team mate German Heinz-Harald Frentzen, who started at the back after he had stalled on the grid and forced an inititial re-start.</p>
<p>It all combined to make it possible for the Benettons of Frenchman Jean Alesi and Austrian Alexander Wurz, driving in only his third race, to profit. Alesi finished second and Wurz a delighted, if unexpected, third.</p>
<p>Briton David Coulthard was fourth in the second McLaren, Schumacher's younger brother 21-year-old Ralf fifth in a Jordan and world champion Damon Hill of Britain sixth for Arrows.</p>
<p>For Hill, it was akin to a victory as he scored his first point of a troubled year in front of his home crowd after a weekend dominated by rumours of a rift between him and the Arrows team.</p>
<p>"I have never been so happy to get just one point before," said Hill. "It feels like a victory to me."</p>
