<p>Lithuanian President Algirdas Brazauskas on Friday urged the European Union to start talks with all aspiring Baltic members at the same time.</p>
<p>The EU's executive Commission on Thursday decided in principle to start talks with only one Baltic state, Estonia, as well as four other eastern European countries: Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovenia.</p>
<p>Lithuania and the third Baltic state, Latvia, have pushed hard to be included in a first wave of EU enlargement.</p>
<p>"The three Baltic countries do not differ from each other according to the criteria of the (EU) questionnaire and all three states should start talks at the same time," Brazauskas told a news conference.</p>
<p>He was referring to the questionnaires sent out to each aspiring member state on their financial, social and legislative structure.</p>
<p>Brazauskas said the opinion of the Commission was preliminary and remained to be finalised in Strasbourg next Tuesday, the day before the EU executive unveils advice on which countries are ready to start talks.</p>
<p>All three Baltic states won independence in 1991 and have made rapid strides to throw off 50 years of Soviet rule. Economic reforms, particularly in Estonia, have made faster progress than other ex-Soviet republics.</p>
<p>Brazauskas said he was satisfied with the outcome of this week's NATO summit, which invited only Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland to join in a first wave of new members.</p>
<p>Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia were mentioned as "Baltic region" aspiring members.</p>
<p>"I am satisfed with the results, but of course it would have been more satisfying if Lithuania had been mentioned among the three countries," Brazauskas said.</p>
<p>"We should not lose our optimism. We are not forgotten and it is very clear which are the contenders in the Baltic region," he added.</p>
<p>Moscow has made clear it would regard it as unacceptable for the Baltic states to be offered NATO membership.</p>
