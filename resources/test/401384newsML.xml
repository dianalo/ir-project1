<p>January sales of existing Florida homes rose to 7,100 in January, an increase of 7 percent over the same month last year, the Florida Association of Realtors said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The median sales price rose to $92,500, an increase of 3 percent over January 1996.</p>
<p>The association attributed the boom to strong consumer confidence, out-of-staters seeking vacation homes and relatively stable interest rates.</p>
<p>The average rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 7.8 percent in January, compared to 7.3 percent a year ago.</p>
<p>In the Jacksonville area, where sales rose 24 percent over last January, realtor Pam Bingemann credited an unusually large number of out-of-state relocations and "the lowest unemployment rate in years" with spurring sales.</p>
<p>Naples continued to reap benefits from the nation's strong stock market. Second-home purchases in the resort community helped push homes resales 37 percent above last January.</p>
<p>The Pensacola area had a 30 percent increase in home resales, largely due to a $300 million program to relocate a Millington, Tenn., training command to the Pensacola Naval Air Station. Personnel will be arriving for the next six months.</p>
<p>The Punta Gorda area saw a 28 percent increase in home resales, partly reflecting a recovery from slow sales last year.</p>
<p>Realtor Carolyn Depenbrock said the area also got a boost from Money magazine's selection of Punta Gorda as the second best place to live in the United States, which stirred especially strong interest among boaters.</p>
<p>The Fort Pierce-Port St. Lucie area saw a 26 percent increase, largely due to move-up buying.</p>
<p>January home resales rose by 20 percent in Tampa-St. Petersburg, 19 percent in Fort Myers-Cape Coral, 11 percent in Sarasota-Bradenton, 10 percent in Miami, 6 percent in Gainesville, four percent in Melbourne-Titusville and one percent in Daytona Beach.</p>
<p>January resales dropped by 26 percent in Fort Lauderdale, 19 percent in Orlando, 13 percent in Ocala, 11 percent in West Palm Beach-Boca Raton and one percent in Tallahassee.</p>
