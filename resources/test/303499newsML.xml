<p>Apache Corp said Monday the D-2 well on the Zhao Dong Block in Bohai Bay, offshore China, tested at a combined rate of 11,571 barrels of oil per day.</p>
<p>The D-2 is a wildcat in the Guantao and deeper formations and an appraisal of the shallower Minghuazhen formation discovered in the D-1 well last July, Apache said.</p>
<p>The D-2 had 225 feet of net pay and was tested in six zones between 3,283 feet and 5,445 feet in the Minghuazhen and Guantao formations and a lower Tertiary-age sand. It was drilled to a total depth of 7,501 feet.  </p>
<p>Apache is operator of the Zhao Dong Block with a 50 percent working interest. XCL Ltd holds the other 50 percent.</p>
<p>The exploratory tests in the Guantao registered a combined rate of 4,860 barrels of oil per day, Apache said.</p>
<p>The deepest formation tested, a lower Tertiary-age sand, had the highest flow rate, measuring 4,370 barrels of 27-degree gravity oil and 774,000 cubic feet of associated gas per day on an open choke with 147 pounds per square inch of flowing tubing pressure. Perforations were between 5,396 feet and 5,445 feet, the company said.</p>
<p>"Our new-zone discovery in the lower Tertiary is significant in three respects," said Apache President G. Steven Farris. "It has higher flow rates, higher reservoir energy and higher gravity crude oil than we've found in shallower zones on the block.</p>
<p>"Results from this well now need to be evaluated and incorporated into our plans for the block."</p>
<p>Including the D-2, Apache and XCVL have completed five wells on the Zhao Dong Block since operations began in 1994. The combined test rates registered some 24,400 barrels of oil per day. Apache presently is attempting to log the F-1 exploratory well on the block, the company said.</p>
