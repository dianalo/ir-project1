<p>Dark northern spring wheat cash bids edged higher on Friday, following modest gains in MGE September futures, but movement remained slow as farmers waited for higher prices, several cash merchants said.</p>
<p>"The consensus in the country is that the farmer is going to put the wheat away," a Montana dealer said. "Whether it's going under (USDA) loan or just into the bin remains to be seen, but it doesn't look like much of it is going to end up in the elevator, at least not at first."</p>
<p>Some dealers noted increased demand for prompt shipment to the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p>"There's a little better demand if you can ship quick," one merchant said. "There's some people out on the Coast who are looking. There's about a nickel difference for prompt shipment."</p>
<p>Merchandisers in the Red River Valley in eastern North Dakota continued to report crop stress due to excessive moisture. Forecasts called for another bout of heavy rains, with two to four inches expected in some isolated areas.  </p>
