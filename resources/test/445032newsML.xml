<p>Nigeria's military government cited peaceful local elections throughout the country as proof that its controversial civil rule plan was popular despite criticism in the West.</p>
<p>Information Minister Walter Ofonagoro said the orderly and enthusiastic voting showed that Nigerians endorsed the government's programme to transfer power to civilians in 1998.</p>
<p>"That's the way elections should be," Ofonagoro told reporters after watching polling in the city of Kaduna. "We want to show the world that Nigeria is the father of democracy."</p>
<p>Elections chief Sumner Dagogo-Jack said: "The turnout of the people has been very impressive and encouraging."</p>
<p>Local observers and Western diplomats who followed Saturday's polling said they were surprised by the relaxed manner of the voting.</p>
<p>"It was quite orderly and smooth. Even the police were unobtrusive," said a Western diplomat in Lagos, Nigeria's largest city and a centre of opposition to the military.</p>
<p>Vote counting started on the spot at polling stations. An indication of how the five legal parties fared was expected on Sunday but final results were unlikely to be known for two or three days.</p>
<p>More than 55 million people from a population of 100 million registered to vote to elect chairmen and councillors for 774 local authorities across the country.</p>
<p>Voter turnout figures were not immediately available but officials said they should be much higher than the lowly 35 percent recorded in June 1993 Nigeria's last multi-party presidential election.</p>
<p>Nigeria's then military rulers scrapped the 1993 poll as southern millionaire Moshood Abiola headed for victory and General Sani Abacha seized power in the confusion that followed.</p>
<p>Nigeria sank further into crisis after Abiola was detained in June 1994 for proclaiming himself president. Abacha's government fell foul of the international community when it hanged nine minority actvisits, including writer Ken Saro-wiwa, in November 1995 for murder.</p>
<p>Pro-democacry activists who say Abiola should be freed and declared president asked their supporters to boycott local elections held a year ago on a non-party basis as a test run.</p>
<p>They kept a low profile during Saturday's elections  while denouncing the military's transition plans.</p>
<p>"The whole transition plan is patchy," said leading pro-democracy campaigner Ayo Obe. "Voters don't even know people they are voting for nor do they know the parties."</p>
<p>Many veteran politicians stayed on the sidelines because their parties were not registered by the military. They were expected to decide their affiliation after results of the local elections were known.</p>
<p>The elections were also intended to provide training for officials who will organise future multi-party state and national polls culminating in a presidential vote next year.</p>
<p>The army has ruled Nigeria for most of the time since independence from Britain in 1960 and there has been widespread scepticism about its promise to step down in 1998.</p>
<p>Abacha insists that the army will keep its promise to return to barracks but has so far avoided addressing the issue of his own future. Speculation is rife that he will not hand over power to any civilian president other than himself.</p>
