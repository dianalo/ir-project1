<p>Madrid stocks rallied to close higher on Wednesday, buoyed by strength in other key European markets. Traders said they were now more optimistic about the short-term outlook than in previous sessions.</p>
<p>The general index rose 6.59 points, or 1.42 percent, to close at 469.68. The Ibex-35 index of leading shares advanced 81.37 points, 1.54 percent, to close at 5,378.99.</p>
<p>"We've seen a return of funds and in particular funds from abroad," said one trader. He added this was reflected in a higher turnover than that seen in recent sessions, with 69 billion pesetas changing hands.</p>
<p>"The day has been very positive and during the afternoon we saw a lot more money coming in than in previous sessions. In the short-term we will remain at the whim of external factors though," said another trader.</p>
<p>Some 36 percent of turnover focussed on trading in Telefonica, Repsol and Endesa shares. Telefonica rose 90 pesetas, 2.78 percent, to 3,325, while Repsol gained 100 pesetas to 5,680. Endesa advanced 280 pesetas to 3,088.</p>
