<p>New York ad-agency Grey Advertising is set to acquire France's third biggest advertising group Boulet Dru Dupuy Petit (BDDP), industry sources said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The dossier has been sent to all the majors in the industry and in the end it is Grey Advertising who is going to seal the deal," a source said.</p>
<p>Walter Butler, the investor who leads the European Strategic Investment (ESI) fund which has 20 percent of BDDP and heads an alliance of investors controlling 46 percent of the company, had no comment on the information.</p>
<p>BDDP was also not available for comment.</p>
<p>Butler has been looking for a buyer for BDDP for some time and in May he met Grey Advertising chief Ed Meyer who is interested in BDDP's U.S. unit, Wells Rich Greene.</p>
<p>Butler led a group of investors in 1993 to buy up the loss-making ad-agency. The group posted a profit of 65 million francs ($12.8 million) last year and Butler is now trying to sell.</p>
<p>Industry sources said that the Grey deal would be concluded at $150 million maximum, much below the $200 million originally sought by Butler.</p>
<p>Other candidates for the acquisition were Maurice &amp; Charles Saatchi and WPP Group Plc but these dropped out of negotiations.</p>
<p>Cordiant Plc in July denied being interested in the group.</p>
<p>Wells Rich has major accounts such as Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>
