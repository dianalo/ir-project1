<p>The Bank of Portugal on Monday quashed fears it could sell off a chunk of its $5 billion gold reserves as a cushion if the country struggled to meet the tough entry test for joining a European single currency.</p>
<p>Concerns over the central bank's strategy arose after Economy Minister Augusto Mateus said Portugal could sell part of its gold reserves.</p>
<p>"Portugal, which holds a large proportion of its reserves in gold...has the possibility to sell part of its gold reserves," Mateus told the TSF radio station.</p>
<p>A central bank report estimated pure gold reserves at the end of 1995 were worth some 775 billion escudos ($5 billion).</p>
<p>At the end of September, the central bank had liquid official reserves, which include gold, estimated to be worth 3,338 billion escudos, with the gold valued at market prices, according to the central bank.</p>
<p>Local economists said Portugal's expected entry into the planned single currency would reduce its need for gold reserves.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Antonio Guterres has frequently expressed Portugal's determination to be among the first wave of countries to join the single currency, or euro, in January 1999.</p>
<p>But a central bank source said profits from selling part of the gold reserves would be too small to have an impact on the country's prospects of meeting Maastricht Treaty budget targets.</p>
<p>The Maastricht Treaty on European economic and monetary union requires countries to aim for a budget deficit of no more than three percent of gross domestic product in 1997.</p>
<p>Portuguese budget proposals, now being considered by parliament, forecast the budget deficit will drop to 2.9 percent of gross domestic product in 1997, within the three-percent goal, from around four percent this year.</p>
<p>The central bank source added that published remarks by central bank governor Antonio De Sousa that quoted him as saying the bank had no immediate plans to sell gold to meet convergence criteria, remained valid.</p>
<p>De Sousa told Expresso weekly in an interview published on October 6 "The possibility to sell gold to meet Maastricht criteria does not exist as, if the operation took place in 1997, the results would only show through in 1998," just before the euro launch.</p>
<p>However, the source did not rule out gold sales in the future.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Antonio Sousa Franco also told TSF radio he believed now was not the right time for the Bank of Portugal to sell off part of its gold reserves.</p>
<p>"Now is not a good time, but we are aware that some decisions will have to be taken in the coming years," he said.</p>
