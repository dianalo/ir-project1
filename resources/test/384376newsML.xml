<p>The National Bank of Slovakia (NBS) said on Tuesday it was satisfied with recent crown fluctuations and said variable daily fixings were aimed at keeping away speculative capital.</p>
<p>"Crown exchange rate daily changes are currently much more significant to scare off speculative capital, which already seems to have left to a large extent," NBS's treasury department director Frantisek Szulenyi told Reuters.  </p>
<p>The crown fell to 1.3 percent below parity with its mark/dollar basket on Tuesday, as the NBS matched the market, fixing it at 33.502/dollar 19.671/mark, or 1.29 percent below parity, after -0.49 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>Over a week ago, the crown was above parity at a similar level of deviation.</p>
<p>"If we were not satisfied with the rates we have been fixing, they would have been fixed at different levels," Szulenyi said.</p>
<p>"Another reason why we have moved the rate so significantly is to make potential domestic borrowers abroad realise what risk is related to their efforts to obtain cheaper funds abroad," he added.</p>
<p>The Slovak crown has lost five percent against the dollar since the beginning of the year, but meanwhile it has rebounded some 50 basis points against the central bank's mark/dollar basket, Szulenyi said.</p>
