<p>Brazil stocks ended higher following a rise on Wall Street, but trade was weak as many investors stayed away due to concern about delays in state miner Cia Vale do Rio Doce's privatization, brokers said.</p>
<p>"The market might have gone up even more, but there is concern about CVRD," one local trader said. "The market was waiting for the auction."</p>
<p>The Sao Paulo bourse's Bovespa index of 49 most-traded shares rose 0.99 percent to end at 9,858 points on moderately thin volume of 493.4 million reais ($464 million).  </p>
<p>Brokers said most investiors have no doubt the company will be privatized, but bolsa activity for the day was pegged to legal manoeuvering linked to CVRD's selloff, which had been set for 1000 local/0900 EDT today.</p>
<p>Brazil's government spent the day trying to overturn a wave of last minute court injunctions suspending the auction. By late in the day, officials still held out hope the sale would go forward Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Many investors remained on the sidelines, waiting to see what happened with CVRD's privatization.  </p>
<p>Local shares, including CVRD and led by benchmark Telebras, rose on the back of rises in New York, but traders said the rise could have been stronger if trade was more brisk.</p>
<p>Prefered shares of Telebras rose 1.24 percent to end at 122.00 reais, while CVRD's blue-chip preferred rose 0.37 percent to 27.00 reais and its illiquid common jumped 3.47 percent to 29.49 reais.  </p>
<p>Power sector stocks also rose. The bolsa's Electrical Energy Index ended 1.05 percent higher at 2,700 points, led by Minas gerais state power firm Cemig, whose preferred rose 1.27 percent to 47.99 reais.</p>
<p>Blue-chip power holding Eletrobras' blue-chip preferred B share rose 0.6 percent to end at 506.00 reais.</p>
