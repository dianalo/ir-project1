<text>
<p>Nomura Holding America Inc said Thursday  it planned to spin off its commercial real estate division into a  separate company.</p>
<p>The U.S. unit of Nomura Securities Co Ltd of Japan said its chief  executive Michael Berman is leaving to become chairman of the new  real estate venture, which Nomura will initially capitalize.</p>
<p>The company said it would capitalize the real estate company with  equity capital and leverage in similar amounts as it has provided  to the division until now.  </p>
<p>It added the division's head, Ethan Penner, will become chief executive  and president of the new company and Boyd Fellows and Brian Pilcher  will become co-operating officers.</p>
<p>Nomura named William Wraith IV and Atsushi Yoshikawa as co-chief executives  to replace Berman. It added Mark McGauley will remain chief financial  officer.</p>
<p>Nomura said the real estate company would initially maintain offices  in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, Chicago, Miami and New York,  but it expected rapid growth of the venture in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p>Berman, Penner and a Nomura Holding America spokesman were not immediately  available for comment.</p>
