<p>Gulf refined products, particularly middle distillates, are unlikely to be in short supply in the coming week and price premiums are vulnerable to further losses, oil traders based in the Middle East Gulf said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Buyers have held off for softer premiums despite the onset of winter chills in key consumer markets, tight Far East markets and a cut-back in product supplies because of refinery maintenance in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.</p>
<p>"It's not pretty out here at the moment," said a trader.</p>
<p>East African demand, other than a tender from Kenya, was also mute, traders said.</p>
<p>One percent sulphur gas oil and jet premia were seen at no better than 40 cents a barrel, down 10-20 cents on the week and nearly a dollar weaker than October highs.</p>
<p>No middle distillate spot requirements were seen for delivery this month into India while sales to Japan were discouraged by a sharp backwardation in prices.</p>
<p>Short-term market direction would come from India Oil Corp's (IOC) gas oil tender for January supplies which is expected to be awarded within the next 48 hours, traders said.</p>
<p>In its last tender for December delivery IOC bought 520,000 tonnes of diesel in 13 cargoes and traders are expecting at least similar purchasing levels for January.</p>
<p>Gulf state-owned refiners remained the main beneficiaries of higher outright prices, fanned by crude's strength.</p>
<p>Gas oil was assessed at $30.00 a barrel fob Gulf on Thursday and jet at $30.60, the spread widening on Asian kerosene tightness.</p>
<p>Gulf fuel markets were upbeat, reflected in the Fujairah bunker market gaining $6 in two days. 380-cst bunker fuel from the Gulf port was assessed on Thursday at $116-118 a tonne and $126-128 for 180cst.</p>
