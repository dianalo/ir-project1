<p>Hong Kong stocks are expected to retain a positive tone in the week ahead but after a year of hefty gains, investors are likely to sit back and enjoy the holiday period leaving stocks to trade narrowly, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index closed at 13,131.41 points on Friday, after posting its biggest point gain since August 1994 with a rise of 284.85 points.</p>
<p>The index rose 2.71 percent last week and is up 30.36 percent this year.</p>
<p>"Hong Kong's performance is already very good so I don't see any need to window dress this year. Everybody is already happy where they are," said Franklin Lam, director of research at HG Asia.</p>
<p>The stock exchange will hold a half-day trading session from 1000/0200 GMT to 1230/0430 GMT on December 24 and the market will be closed on December 25 and December 26.</p>
<p>"During the initial part of next week I think it will still be positive but I think that because of the holiday, trading will be thin with not much movement," said Alex Wong, technical analyst at Dharmala Securities.</p>
<p>Analysts said Hong Kong stocks were likely to remain tied to U.S. markets in the week ahead.</p>
<p>"The Hong Kong stock market is following the U.S. bond market," said Ricky Tam, senior research analyst at Delta Asia Securities.</p>
<p>Wong expected the U.S. long bond yield to continue declining in the near term, giving Hong Kong stocks further room to rise.</p>
<p>"Right now I think in the short term it is positive but as the index approaches the 13,350 level there will be quite good resistance ... " Wong said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index registered an all-time high on November 28 at 13,744.30 points.</p>
<p>Timber products processor Ta Fu International Holdings Ltd is due to make its market debut on Friday. The Taiwan-based company offered 168 million new shares at HK$1.01 per share.</p>
