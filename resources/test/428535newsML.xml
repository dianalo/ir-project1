<p>Civilians with the means to do so are deserting Zaire's third city of Kisangani by plane or even canoe, saying that they fear bloodshed should rebels enter the strategic river port.</p>
<p>The 150 or so people lucky enough to get on a flight out on Saturday talked of fighting north of Kisangani earlier although they reported that the city itself was calm but tense.</p>
<p>"The military told me there was heavy fighting at Bengamisa earlier in the week, where there have already been many people killed," said one Western national.</p>
<p>Bengamisa is about 40 km (25 miles) north of Kisangani, a provincial capital that is headquarters and nerve centre for army operations in the war zone.</p>
<p>At the head of the navigable part of the Zaire River, it is also potentially the most signifigant rebel target since they took up arms in eastern Zaire in October.</p>
<p>Airport and defence ministry sources and civilians arriving in Kinshasa said there had been no notable reports of fighting near the city over the previous two days.</p>
<p>New arrivals said Serb mercenaries were deployed around the city to prevent unruly Zairean troops from looting, as they have done in almost every town threatened by Laurent Kabila's rebels.</p>
<p>They said hundreds more civilians were waiting at Kisangani airport for a commercial flight out, fearing that each one might be the last.</p>
<p>"The people are frightened of the chaos and bloodshed that fighting would bring to Kisangani. But they are not frightened of Mr Kabila," said Lili, a trader who left her family behind.</p>
<p>Dozens of families of soldiers had gathered at the airport on Wednesday for flights to Kinshasa, a sure sign of trouble to come.</p>
<p>The same day, the commander of operations in the region, General Kalume Numbi, said the army was preparing to defend the city with all its means.</p>
<p>"If we do not defend Kisangani the whole of Zaire might blow," he told the Dutch Cooperation Minister Jan Pronk, who was accompanied on a visit to the area by journalists.</p>
<p>A missionary who reached Kisangani airport after travelling 100 km (60 miles) up river in a pirogue or canoe said hundreds of Kisangani inhabitants were fleeing by boat.</p>
<p>"Lots of people are leaving Kisangani by the river at night. I spent last night on the river and saw many pirogues coming downstream," he said.</p>
<p>Some reports said soldiers had set up check points downstream from Kisangani and were stopping passing boats.</p>
<p>Jumpy mercenaries and soldiers manned at least four road blocks on the 17 km (miles) of road from the city to the airport.</p>
<p>Numerous sources said Zairean soldiers had sown mines around Kisangani and at least two peasants were killed by mines in a plantation outside the city.</p>
<p>Fleeing residents said the main problem for the senior command would be to stop rank and file troops looting and fleeing or just give up should rebels reach the city.</p>
<p>"Many simple soldiers have no appetite for fighting and may just lay down their weapons when the crucial moment arrives," one Western national said.</p>
