<p>Canada's Cambior Inc is looking to bring its production mix between gold and base metals revenues to near parity over the long-term, officials said at a presentation.</p>
<p>"Our production mix is 80 percent gold, and 20 percent base metals. Over the next five years this should be progressively reduced to 70 percent gold and 30 percent base," Louis P. Gignac, Cambior President and Chief Executive Officer said.</p>
<p>In the longer-term, the aim is to bring this (ratio) down to 50:50," Henry A. Roy, senior vice-president Finance and Administration said.</p>
<p>This year, Cambior ia aiming to up its gold production by 10 percent, although its base metal production of copper, zinc and niobium will be flat, Gignac said.</p>
<p>Over the next five years, Cambior has a number of projects in North and South America on the blocks aiming at bringing its gold production up to 800,000 ounces a year from the 1997 target of 550,000 ounces, Gignac said.</p>
<p>Cambior's base metal potential is underlined by the El Pachon project in Argentina, where copper production would be around 200,000 tonnes a year.</p>
<p>The capital expenditure for this development would be around $900 million, and Cambior is currently in initial discussions with potential equity partners.</p>
<p>Also, in Peru Cambior has a 100 percent interest in Peru's La Granja, which is the world's 8th largest copper deposit.</p>
<p>Copper production would be between 250,000 to 300,000 tonnes a year, with a total capex of some $2.2 billion for a vertically-integrated mine, smelter and refinery, Gignac said.</p>
<p>"Our preference is to go the fully-integrated route...We will seek a (50 percent) partner with experience in the down-stream part of the business," he added.</p>
