<p>Dutch champions Ajax Amsterdam have approached Danish striker Jon Dahl Tomasson to see if he will join them next season, the Dutch ANP news agency said on Friday.</p>
<p>Tomasson, the Dutch first division's leading scorer this season with 16 goals, is under contract to Heerenveen until the summer of 1999 but has a get-out clause if a buyer offers seven million guilders ($3.7 million).</p>
<p>Tomasson, who has recently broken into the Danish national squad, is seen as the likely replacement for Patrick Kluivert who leaves Ajax to join AC Milan at the end of this season.</p>
<p>If Tomasson does opt for Ajax, he will team up with fellow Dane Morten Olsen, the European Cup semifinalists' new coach from next season.</p>
