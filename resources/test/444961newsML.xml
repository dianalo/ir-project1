<p>A group of Atlanta Olympic gold medallists from China arrived in Taiwan on Saturday to promote sports exchanges between the two political rivals.</p>
<p>The visit was originally scheduled for February 20 but was postponed because of the death of China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>The Chinese delegation, which includes women's 5,000 metres gold medallist Wang Junxia and women's diving gold medallist Fu Mingxia, was invited by Taiwan's education ministry.</p>
<p>They will visit Taiwan's colleges and training centres and meet athletes and coaches on the island over the next week.</p>
<p>Although Taiwan and China have been political rivals since they split after a civil war ended in 1949, cultural and economic ties have flourished with an unofficial thaw that began in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The two sides competed in the same Olympics for the first time at the 1984 Los Angeles Games.</p>
