<p>Teamsters President Ron Carey said he saw no reason for optimism ahead of a third round of contract talks with the United Parcel Service, scheduled to begin on Thursday.</p>
<p>"While there is no reason for optimism at this point, we will be there, ready to negotiate a reasonable agreement that provides the good jobs that American families need," Carey said in a statement after the talks were announced on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said the two sides had agreed to resume talks to try to end the 10-day-old, nationwide strike of 184,000 Teamsters at the giant package delivery company.</p>
<p>Herman has been in almost round-the-clock contact with Teamster leaders and UPS managers since meeting separately with both parties on Monday.</p>
<p>UPS has called on U.S. President Bill Clinton to step in to end the strike, but White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Wednesday that Clinton continued to oppose intervention.</p>
<p>The Teamsters union has demanded better pay and the conversion of part-time jobs into full-time jobs, while UPS has said it will not improve its latest contract offer.</p>
