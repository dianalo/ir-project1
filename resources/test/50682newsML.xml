<p>Belgian Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt said on Thursday Belgium would pledge to maintain its primary budget surplus at 5.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) to prove its determination to reduce its debt/GDP ratio.</p>
<p>He told a news conference after meeting French Finance Minister Jean Arthuis he was confident that Belgium would meet a Maastricht treaty criterion on debt despite its sizeable debt/GDP ratio.</p>
<p>"The Maastricht criterion on debt is drawn up in different terms than for deficits," Maystadt said, noting that the debt criterion took account of a declining trend.</p>
<p>Belgium would be able to show that its debt/GDP ratio had been declining for four years and to prove its willingness to continue to reduce this debt by pledging to maintain its primary budget surplus, which he said would be 5.5 percent of GDP this year.</p>
<p>"We will pledge to maintain this level," he said. He said it was not by accident that the provisions in the Maastricht treaty on debt took account of a declining trend.</p>
<p>"It's not by chance," he said, quipping that he should know because he was finance minister at the time the Maastricht treaty on European monetary union was negotiated.</p>
<p>Belgium's debt/GDP ratio eased to 133.8 percent in 1995 from 137.9 percent in 1993.</p>
