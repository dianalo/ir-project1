<headline>US Airways settles 5 crash suits--lawyer.</headline>
<dateline>COLUMBIA, S.C. 1997-03-12</dateline>

<p>US Airways Group Inc and lawyers for five plaintiffs announced Wednesday a settlement of lawsuits resulting from the 1994 crash of a USAir jet outside Charlotte N.C., the plaintiffs' lawyer said.</p>
<p>Attorney David Rapoport said he had settled with US Airways in lawsuits over the deaths of Freddie Sue Sturkie and three other people killed when Flight 1016 went down in a violent thunderstorm on July 2, 1994.</p>
<p>Also settled was a suit brought by a survivor of the crash, in which 37 people died.</p>
<p>Rapoport said the two sides had agreed not to discuss terms of the settlement.</p>
<p>He said the Sturkie case, one of two that had been set for trial today, was a "seven-figure settlement." But he then backed away from that statement, saying only that the five settlements together totalled "in the millions."</p>
<p>Rapoport said the settlements were substantially higher as a result of a federal jury verdict Friday in which US Airways was found at fault in the crash.</p>
<p>A lawyer representing US Airways had no comment on the settlements.</p>
