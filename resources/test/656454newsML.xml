<p>A battle for control of the largest U.S. maker of machine tools, Giddings &amp; Lewis Inc., drew near an end Thursday when the company agreed to be acquired by German steel and engineering giant Thyssen AG for $675 million.</p>
<p>The $21-per-share Thyssen offer overtook a rival $631 million, $19-a-share offer made in late April by Harnischfeger Industries Inc., which Giddings management rejected last month as inadequate.</p>
<p>Announcement of the Thyssen agreement led Milwaukee-based Harnischfeger to announce that it may drop its six-week-old effort to take over Giddings.</p>
<p>"If Thyssen's bid for $21 per share proves bona fide to us, we will not pursue our tender offer for G&amp;L," Harnischfeger Chairman Jeffery Grade said in a statement.</p>
<p>Wall Street analysts said the Thyssen deal was likely to be completed, although it may face obstacles in Washington.</p>
<p>Machine tools are militarily sensitive and the Defence Department has intervened in the past in mergers that would have put such technology in the hands of non-U.S. firms.</p>
<p>"Giddings &amp; Lewis has some very important proprietary technology ... So that's an issue. Anti-trust (issues) I don't think can be shrugged off either," said Robert McCarthy, an industry analyst at the ABN AMRO Chicago Corp. investment bank.</p>
<p>The amount of business that Fond du Lac, Wis.-based Giddings does with the government is likely not large enough to pose a problem, however, Giddings Chief Executive Marvin Isles said in an interview.</p>
<p>"We did less than $2 million in total U.S. government sales last year. We don't think it will be a factor whatsoever," Isles said.</p>
<p>On the antitrust issue, he said, Thyssen has only minor U.S. operations. "Most of their (Thyssen's) capability is outside of North America. So we don't think that's going to be an issue at all," Isles said.</p>
<p>The board of directors of Giddings on May 8 rejected the offer from Harnischfeger, which later said it would take its bid directly to Giddings shareholders.</p>
<p>Giddings said its board looked at several strategic alternatives after Harnischfeger unveiled its bid in late April. "Some we discarded after we looked at them. Out of all of those alternatives ... we determined that (Thyssen) was the best alternative for us," Isles said.</p>
<p>Giddings' name, managers and headquarters will remain in place under the Thyssen agreement, Isles said. No plant closings or layoffs are anticipated.</p>
<p>Giddings, which makes automation products and machine tools, reported 1996 revenues of $763 million.</p>
<p>Based in Duesseldorf, Germany, Thyssen has annual revenues of about $26.2 billion and owns 320 companies worldwide in a variety of industries. Harnischfeger makes heavy machinery and manufacturing systems for papermaking, mining and materials handling. Its 1996 revenues were about $2.9 billion.</p>
<p>"I don't know why Giddings wants to sell to a German company, rather than another Wisconsin-based company. Two dollars more doesn't seem like that much. I hope this isn't just all about management wanting to keep their jobs," said Walter Liptak, an analyst at Barrington Research, a Chicago investment research firm.</p>
<p>Other analysts said Giddings &amp; Lewis will fit well with Thyssen's long-term strategy to become a global auto components supplier, a trend well in place long before it was sidetracked by the merger of its steel division with the Krupp Group.</p>
<p>"Giddings &amp; Lewis is the ideal fit with Thyssen to enhance our core production systems business," Thyssen Chairman Dieter Vogel said in a statement. The merger is subject to antitrust review in the United States, Germany and other countries, and to approval by G&amp;L shareholders.</p>
<p>Giddings' stock gained $1.73 to $20.73 on Nasdaq.</p>
