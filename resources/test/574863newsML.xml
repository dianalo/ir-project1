<p>The separatist group whose members staged a spectacular armed protest in Venice two days ago said on Sunday that the Italian state had suffered "a glorious demonstrative defeat".</p>
<p>A statement sent to the national news agency Ansa described central government in Rome as an "occupying regime from the south" and said the Venetian Liberation Army would carry out more protest actions "in the forms, times and places considered most opportune".</p>
<p>Ansa published parts of the statement and indicated that it considered it authentic.</p>
<p>Police commandos stormed the landmark bell tower in the lagoon city's St Mark's Square on Friday, arresting eight separatists who had occupied it for some five hours.</p>
<p>The separatists had commandeered a "vaporetto" ferry to bring a home-made armoured car and a camper van down the Grand Canal to the square. There were no injuries but the incident shocked Italy.</p>
<p>Venice was for centuries a independent power with control stretching down the Adriatic and into the Middle East. Known as the "Most Serene Republic", it fell on May 12, 1797, when French forces of Napoleon Bonaparte entered the city.</p>
<p>Italy's main separatist party, the Northern League, derided Friday's protest as the work of lunatics but mainstream political parties warned that the incident could mark a violent shift in the secessionist camp.</p>
<p>Many politicians accused firebrand Northern League leader Umberto Bossi of stoking dangerous fires with inflammatory rhetoric about an independent "Republic of Padania".</p>
<p>The eight arrested were from towns in the mainland provinces of Verona and Padua, where magistrates have been trying to determine how many other people belonged to the shadowy group.</p>
