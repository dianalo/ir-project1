<p>China's state refiner SINOPEC will gradually introduce a new brand of lubricating oil to boost its competitiveness and end market chaos, a company official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"We will gradually adopt the Torch brandname on all lubricating oil products," the official said by telephone.</p>
<p>SINOPEC has already launched the new brand and will use it for products produced by selected subsidiaries before gradually extending it to more of its companies, he said. "The process could take one to two years."</p>
<p>"Some existing brandnames have a significant market influence on customers and will continue to be strong for some time before being replaced by our new brand," he said.</p>
<p>SINOPEC currently has about 10 brands of lubricating oil, including Greatwall, which is popular in Beijing, and South Sea, produced by the Maoming Petrochemical Corp in southern Guangdong province.</p>
<p>"The move will help SINOPEC to compete with foreign brands," the official said.</p>
<p>Foreign brands such as Mobil and Shell have already entered China and made an impact, he said. "The market share of foreign brands is 7-8 percent and is approching 10 percent, he said. "Their expansion is fast."</p>
<p>SINOPEC's share of the lubricating oil market is 80 percent.</p>
<p>"The brand will deal a blow to mismanaged small-sized producers with outdated equipment," the official said.</p>
<p>China has more than 3,000 lubricating oil producers, most of them small-scale. He compared that with a total of about 2,000 producers in the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Many small-scale producers have their own brands and produce low quality or even fake lubricating oil, he said. "That has led to chaos in the market and damage to good quality products."</p>
<p>China's demand for lubricating oil reached 2.8 million tonnes in 1995 and annual production capacity stood at 3.27 million tonnes, the Economic Daily said.</p>
