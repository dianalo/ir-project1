<p>Lithuania's bourse said on Monday that it had added 11 new shares to its A group and had removed six from the list.</p>
<p>The head of the bourse's listing department, Saulius Malinauskas, told Reuters that the additions and removals would come into effect on April 28.</p>
<p>The A list tracks the most active shares on the Lithuanian stock exchange.</p>
<p>"The eleven new companies all meet the main requirements for the A list, such as operating profitably last year and having liquid stocks for the past three months," Malinauskas said.</p>
<p>The eleven new A list shares are: Linas, Lietkavelis, Endokriniai Preparatai, Vilniaus Degtine, Gubernija, Marijampoles Pieno Konservai, Klaipeda Sea Caro Company, Vilniaus Pergale, Vilniaus Kailiai, Lithuanian Energy and Stumbras.</p>
<p>The six shares to be removed from the A list are: ordinary shares of Silikatas, privileged shares in Sanitas, ordinary and privileged shares in Vilniaus Grudai, ordinary and privileged shares in Klaipedos Duona.</p>
<p>Malinauskas said that Silkatas had a loss in 1996 while the other five shares were not traded very actively over the past three months.</p>
<p>There are currently 43 shares from 37 companies traded on the A list.</p>
<p>From April 28, there will be 48 shares from 44 companies on the A list.</p>
