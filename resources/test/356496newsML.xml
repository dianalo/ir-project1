<p>Russian gas oil shipments from Baltic port Ventspils are seen rising to record levels in February, but fears of a squeeze on front-month gas oil futures and ample supplies in the Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) refining centre are keeping buyers away.</p>
<p>"An armada of cargoes is already scheduled to load in the first 10 days of the month, but the steep screen backwardation caused by the squeeze is deterring buyers," one trader said.</p>
<p>Latvia's Ventspils usually exports around 800,000 tonnes of gas oil each month, some 25,000 tonnes a day. Reliable shipping sources say up to 14 cargoes are scheduled to load in the first 11 days of February alone, at a rate of nearly 40,000 tonnes a day.</p>
<p>Daily January Ventspils gas oil loadings averaged 24,800 tonnes.</p>
<p>The glut has put pressure on price premiums for 0.2 sulphur gas oil in the northwest European market.</p>
<p>"Buyers are looking more at March (IPE futures) related numbers and even the sellers are down to Feb flat," a trader said of physical premiums.</p>
<p>Prompt differentials to the IPE gas oil screen for the Russian oil have eased from Feb IPE +$3 a tonne on Friday to near screen parity on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fears of another squeeze play on the front-month IPE contract has dried up physical buying.</p>
<p>One U.S. trade house is thought to be running a long futures position and is expected to take a large delivery from the February futures contract when it expires on the twelfth of that month.</p>
<p>February futures rose to a $10 spread over March on Friday, but had narrowed to a $7.75 backwardation on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said the lack of arbitrage opportunities out of European markets and above normal temperatures in much of Europe also kept spot market sentiment weak.</p>
<p>The only support for Russian cargoes this week was seen coming from the U.S. trade house seen showing active interest for lower priced cargoes.</p>
<p>Previous squeezes have pushed prompt IPE spreads above $20 a tonne. In March of last year a squeeze took the prompt spread to a post-Gulf War record of $26.50.</p>
<p>But traders said previous big backwardations have been representative of fundamentals with stocks at historically low levels. This is not the case this time, they said.</p>
<p>Traders report ample stocks in the key ARA market as well as material coming up from the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>"Cargoes are coming from Russia, from the Med and refiners are also looking for buyers," one broker said.</p>
<p>Traders said good supplies in ARA had pegged refinery material back to parity with usually cheaper storage oil.</p>
