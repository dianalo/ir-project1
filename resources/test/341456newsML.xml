<p>Former Olympic bomb suspect Richard Jewell reached a settlement with CNN on Tuesday and opened a libel battle with the publisher of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, his attorneys said.</p>
<p>The two moves, almost exactly six months after the bombing that left two dead and more than 100 injured in Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park, represented Jewell's counterattack on the news media that hounded him for 88 days last year.</p>
<p>The Cox-owned Atlanta Journal was the first to identify the 34-year-old Jewell as a suspect in the bombing, which came at the height of the Atlanta Olympic Games. He was cleared by the Justice Department in October and accused the media and  FBI of almost destroying his life during "88 days of hell."</p>
<p>Up to now, the biggest victory for the former security guard had been a December settlement with NBC. An unconfirmed report in the Wall Street Journal said the General Electric Co subsidiary paid Jewell more than $500,000.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, his attorneys said the former security guard also was talking about movie deals with Hollywood studios including HBO and 20th Century Fox.</p>
<p>"We have reached a settlement with CNN," said Lin Wood, one of two civil lawyers retained by Jewell. "The amount of the settlement is both confidential and, under the terms of the agreement, cannot be characterized, except for me to tell you that it was a monetary payment to Barbara Jewell the mother and Richard Jewell."</p>
<p>Cable News Network, the 24-hour news channel, which like HBO is a unit of media giant Time Warner Inc., acknowledged the settlement but said it continued to believe its coverage of the bombing's aftermath was fair and accurate.</p>
<p>"As with NBC, I think it's a safe assumption that both sides are again in this instance mutually satisfied with the settlement," the attorney added.</p>
<p>He spoke after he and his colleagues filed a libel suit in Fulton County Superior Court against Cox Enterprises Inc., the Atlanta-based media giant that operates newspapers, television and radio stations and cable-TV channels across the country.</p>
<p>Also named in the lawsuit were nine Cox reporters and columnists, a small Georgia college where Jewell worked as a campus police officer until last May, the college's president and its public relations officer.</p>
<p>Neither Cox nor officials at Piedmont College in Demorest, Georgia, returned repeated phone calls.</p>
<p>"This is a billion-dollar corporation and media conglomerate," Wood said of Cox. "They need to be held accountable when they commit this kind of act. And the only way to get the message across to Cox Enterprises Inc. is to get their attention with a financial verdict."</p>
<p>The suit contends statements by Piedmont's president Ray Cleere, as published by the Journal-Constitution, damaged Jewell's reputation by alleging that he matched the FBI's profile of a lone bomber.</p>
<p>Jewell had similar complaints against CNN. His lawyers claimed it misrepresented his employment history and described him as fitting the bomber profile not only in general news coverage but in articles posted on the CNN Internet website.</p>
<p>Jewell also was critical of comments made about him on the Oct. 28 edition of the CNN current affairs program, Crossfire. The next day, CNN apologized for the language that had been used by Crossfire's liberal co-host Bill Press.</p>
<p>But Wood said the main contention with CNN was that it violated the privacy of Jewell and his mother by keeping a news camera and a "surveillance car" outside their apartment long after federal agents had searched the residence.</p>
