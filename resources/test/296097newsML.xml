<p>Morocco's giant phosphate group, Office Cherifien des Phosphates (OCP), controlling more than one third of the world's crude phosphate market, plans to invest 9.3 billion dirhams ($1.05 billion) over the five next years.</p>
<p>"This (investment) programme foresees rehabilitating and upgrading existing equipment, expanding output capacities, including setting up a new phosphoric acid plant," said OCP head Mourad Cherif in remarks published on Thursday.</p>
<p>The new acid unit in Jorf Lasfar, a town near Morocco's economic capital Casablanca, would boost the country's current phosphoric acid production by 33 percent by the year 2000, said Cherif in an interview with the Moroccan daily L'Opinion.</p>
<p>"We export today 34 percent of the world market needs in crude phosphate, 50 percent of phosphoric acid and more than 15 percent of (its demand for) fertiliser," Cherif said.</p>
<p>OCP, Morocco's main employer with 28,000 workers, provided the state budget with 2.3 billion dirhams in taxes, including 600 million in export tax in 1995, according to the company's latest published data.</p>
