<dateline>CHICAGO 1997-04-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>CME hog and pork belly futures closed mostly lower on weaker cash hog and pork belly prices and a technical retracement, traders said.</p>
<p>Hog futures closed 0.525 cent per lb lower to 0.200 higher with April off most at 71.975 cents. Only December and distant July 1998 posted gains. Pork bellies ended 1.775 to 0.100 cent a lb lower, paced by May at 78.300 cents.</p>
<p>Technical fund long liquidation sparked by overbought conditions and selling on uncertainty over cash markets again weighed on hog futures. Futures still hold a premium to cash, traders said.</p>
<p>The latest CME lean hog index was quoted at $70.58 per cwt and April started the day at 72.000 cents per lb.</p>
<p>Deferred contracts were still underpinned somewhat by expectations that pork exports will be expanding soon. Some packers are building pork stocks to meet the anticipated demand following the Taiwan pork export ban. Last week's Hogs and Pigs report also remained an underlying supportive factor as it showed hog production will remain fairly light into next year, floor sources added.  </p>
<p>Rand Financials traded on both sides of the market, selling April late while buying June and July. Lind-Waldock spread long August/short July before local selling weighed on August, E.D.&amp;F. Man bought April and sold June early, pit sources said.</p>
<p>In hog options, First Chicago spread August 78 puts/74 puts early and bought October 70 puts late. Rosenthal Collins and Refco bought June 80 calls, pit sources added.</p>
<p>Pork bellies ran into profit taking and other selling prompted by an overbought condition and finished lower, traders said.</p>
<p>Part of the selling was prompted by speculation that cash belly prices would again turn lower after reaching the $75 per cwt level as it has in the past before falling. Demand for product turns off at $75 and returns around $65, some sources noted.</p>
<p>"There are signs that product is weakening up again -- it always seems like that cash market gets 65 on the bottom and 75 on the top," saod Rich Tokheim, president of Investment Research Company. He added that the pit apparently had expected a bullish out-of-town report and put that in the market during Tuesday's rally.</p>
<p>The report showed a net in-movement of 236,000 lbs, well under the range of analyst estimates of 650,000 to 1.25 million lbs, but only slightly under the 500,000 lbs or less indication that pit traders had given.</p>
<p>R.J. O'Brien and Refco sold late. Cargill sold early while E.D.&amp;F. Man and LIT division of First Options were early buyers, pit sources said.</p>
