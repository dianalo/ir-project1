<p>The Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) said it will use the daily Frankfurt foreign exchange fixings as a reference point for commercial transactions under the currency board regime which came into force on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The central bank will use and publish the rates of main currencies as they are fixed on the Frankfurt foreign exchange at a given hour," Martin Zaimov, head of the central bank's issue department, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Until now, the BNB calculated a daily fixed rate for major currencies against the lev. On Tuesday, the lev was pegged at 1,000 to the mark in the currency board, rendering the practice obsolete.</p>
<p>Rates of foreign currencies not traded in Frankfurt will be taken from the respective national bank contributor pages on Reuters Terminals, said Zaimov. -- Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-981-4145</p>
