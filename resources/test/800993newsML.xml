<p>Asian dollar deposit rates were steady to easier in dull trade on Thursday, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said most traders were sidelined before today's issue of the U.S. weekly jobless claims, July consumer price index (CPI), June business inventories and July industrial production and capacity utilisation data.</p>
<p>Weekly jobless claims for the week ended August 9, were forecast to be around 317,000 compared with 300,000 reported in the previous week.</p>
<p>The July CPI is expected to show a rise of 0.2 percent against June's 0.1 percent gain.  </p>
<p>Business inventories for June is expected to show an increase of 0.6 percent from a 0.2 percent rise in May.</p>
<p>July industrial production is expected to be up 0.2 percent versus June's 0.3 percent while capacity utilisation for June is expected to be unchanged from May's 83.5 percent.</p>
<p>"Rates were steady to a little bit softer this morning on some position adjustments. There was little impact from Wednesday's retail sales and producer price index figures and most people were sidelined on lack of fresh incentives," a local dealer said.  </p>
<p>"But some traders were waiting for today's issue of the weekly jobless claims, consumer price index, business inventories, industrial production and capacity utilisation numbers for more clues to market direction," he said.</p>
<p>In short dates, Thursday/Friday and weekend were unchanged from Wednesday's common 5-5/8 5-1/2 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Week-fixed eased 1/16 percentage point to 5-9/16 5-7/16 percent.</p>
<p>Among term rates, two-months was unchanged from Wednesday's 5-11/16 5-9/16 percent, four-months unchanged at 5-3/4 5-5/8 and six-months unchanged at 5-7/8 5-3/4 percent.  </p>
<p>Twelve-months eased 1/16 point to 6-1/16 5-15/16 percent.</p>
