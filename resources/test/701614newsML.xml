<p>Azeri President Haydar Aliyev, reinforcing a mild personality cult, on Wednesday signed a law making the anniversary of his effective return to power an annual holdiay.</p>
<p>June 15 will now be known in the former Soviet republic of eight million people as "National Salvation Day". Parliament, dominated by Aliyev supporters after a 1995 election viewed as flawed by international monitors, approved the law last week.</p>
<p>Aliyev, who ruled Azerbaijan as Moscow's viceroy in the 1970s when it was a part of the Soviet Union, returned to the capital Baku from his home region of Nakhchivan on June 15 in 1993 in the midst of a political crisis and quickly consolidated power.</p>
<p>Some parliament members had justified the holiday by saying that Aliyev's return to Baku had prevented a long civil war.</p>
<p>Originally Aliyev was made speaker of parliament by former President Albufaz Elchibey, who fled an army mutiny into internal exile several days later. He officially became president after an election several months later in which he faced no serious opposition.</p>
<p>Elchibey now accuses him of usurping power.</p>
<p>Aliyev, a master political tactician who is popular with many Azeris, has been criticised by human rights watchdogs for taking a heavy-handed approach to opposition groups.</p>
<p>They say he has censored the press and arrested some opponents on political grounds.</p>
<p>Giant portraits of Aliyev adorn some street corners, as do his most famous phrases.</p>
<p>His mild cult of personality still pales in comparison with that of nearby Turkmenistan's President Saparmurat Niyazov, whose statue is ubiqitous in the desert nation and after whom cities have been renamed.</p>
