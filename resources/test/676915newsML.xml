<p>Turkey has pulled out more forces from northern Iraq where it is winding down a cross-border operation against Kurdish rebels, Anatolian news agency said on Friday.</p>
<p>The agency said the military had withdrawn up to 60 tanks, 100 armoured vehicles and some troops from the mountainous area.</p>
<p>"Over the last week some troops returned, completing their missions. This pullout cannot be interpreted as the end of the operation," the agency quoted a military official as saying.</p>
<p>Anatolian said on Thursday that more than 50 tanks and armoured vehicles had returned to Turkey but added that fighting was continuing near the border.</p>
<p>Turkey sent more than 10,000 troops across the border on May 14 in a cross-border drive against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) rebels who use northern Iraq for attacks into Turkish territory.</p>
<p>Much of the Arab world and some of Turkey's Western allies had condemned Ankara for its large-scale incursion into the Kurdish-held region.</p>
<p>Diplomats emphasised the withdrawal was only partial. "I think if they were pulling out all their forces they would certainly make a big deal of announcing it to the world to ease the pressure from the Arab world and the West," a Western diplomat said.</p>
<p>An Iraqi Kurdish militia group, the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) had joined Turkish troops in the fighting.</p>
<p>"After a month, the Turkish operation in northern Iraq is near conclusion after delivering a crushing blow to the PKK," the Iraqi group said in a statement.</p>
<p>"All rural, mountainous and remote region have been swept and cleared of PKK...The KDP asserted its control over large areas in the border region with Turkey," the statement said.</p>
<p>Turkey says it has killed many more than 1,000 guerrillas but foreign analysts say that figure is inflated. The KDP said only 29 of its fighters had been killed. Turkey has not released its own casualty figures in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Anatolian said the latest clashes were taking place between the two Kurdish groups in the mountains near Iraq's northeastern border with Iran, where Turkey's tanks and armoured vehicles were almost useless.</p>
<p>The agency said PKK guerrillas had fled into Iran from the area after attacking KDP units. Turkey often accuses Tehran of sponsoring the rebels, fighting for Kurdish self-rule in Turkey.</p>
<p>More than 24,000 people have been killed in the 12-year conflict.</p>
<p>Turkey's biggest single admitted loss in the current operation was 11 personnel, including two senior officers, who died when the rebels shot down a Cougar transport helicopter in northern Iraq's Zap region earlier this month.</p>
<p>The military blamed many of Turkey's neighbours for helping the guerrillas get hold of the SA-7 anti-aircraft rocket systems that shot down the Cougar and another helicopter.</p>
