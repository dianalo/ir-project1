<p>The Australian dairy industry has held talks with Indonesian officials over removals of import barriers in a fast-growing dairy market, the Australian Dairy Corp (ADC) said.</p>
<p>The Indonesian dairy market was growing by 12.0 percent a year while domestic dairy production was increasing by only five percent, ADC said in its publication Dairy Moves.</p>
<p>"This ... points to the likelihood of a steady growth in imports of dairy products (by) Indonesia," Phil Goode, ADC's manager planning (international), said.</p>
<p>The talks were highly significant, representing the first meaningful discussion ADC had had for years with Indonesia on removal of technical barriers to dairy trade, Goode, who represented ADC at the talks, said.</p>
<p>With trade worth about A$70 million a year, Indonesia is Australia's seventh most important dairy market.</p>
<p>Milk powders and butteroil, which continue to be controlled by Indonesian local content requirements, are the most significant commodities traded at present.</p>
<p>Indonesian processors and dairy cooperatives had expressed interest in working with the ADC in ongoing work to expand the size of the Indonesian dairy market, Goode said.</p>
<p>On the international market in general, ADC said international prices in the first four months of 1997 had remained at levels which resulted in demand from traditional buyers for the key commodities.</p>
<p>The market also had been supported by a string of recent announcements of sizeable tenders for product, it said.</p>
<p>These had included large orders for skim milk powder (SMP) and wholemilk powder from Mexico and several north African countries, as well as a February Japanese SMP tender.</p>
<p>Large purchases of butter from Russia and North Africa had also helped underpin the market, it said.</p>
