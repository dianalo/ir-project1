<p>Uncertainty surrounded North American and Scandinavian (Norscan) pulp stock levels ahead of the announcement of October figures, due later this week, market analysts said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Uncertainty looms for the Norscan stock figures. Expectations range from unchanged levels to an increase of 250,000 tonnes for October," one told Reuters.</p>
<p>Last week rumours hit the market of an increase of up to 250,000 tonnes. Later a Finnish forestry company said its forecast was unchanged while another said its was for a rise of 100,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>"My forecast for the stockpile in the end of October is around 1.8 million tonnes," London-based Paribas analyst Hubert de Marliare told Reuters.</p>
<p>This would mean an increase of about 75,000 tonnes from the September figure of 1.73 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The average for the last eight years' October figures is an increase of 40,000 tonnes compared with the previous month.</p>
