<p>Top officials from Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto Workers union met face-to-face Monday for the first time in an 18-day engine plant strike, while bargainers in one of two General Motors Corp. strikes began to address critical jobs issues.</p>
<p>Chrysler's manufacturing chief, Dennis Pawley, met Monday with Jack Laskowski, who heads the UAW's Chrysler department, said Chrysler spokesman Tony Cervone.</p>
<p>The two discussed major issues in the dispute, which was sparked by Chrysler's decision to shift production of drive shafts to an outside supplier.</p>
<p>Chrysler and UAW officials had previously spoken only by telephone since 1,850 workers struck just before midnight on April 9 at the automaker's Mound Road engine plant in Detroit.</p>
<p>The walkout by UAW Local 51 has curtailed production of Chrysler's most profitable trucks, including its Jeep Grand Cherokee sport utility vehicles and Dodge Ram and Dakota pickup trucks.</p>
<p>On Monday, 950 workers at Chrysler's Kenosha, Wis., engine plant were idled, while the automaker sent about 2,500 Mexican employees back to work.</p>
<p>Using larger V-8 engines built in Mexico and diesel engines supplied by Cummins Engine Co., Chrysler resumed limited production of Ram pickups on a single shift at its Lago Alberto and Saltillo assembly plants in Mexico. The workers, who technically cannot be laid off under Mexican law, had taken mandatory vacation time for the past two weeks.</p>
<p>More than 22,000 Chrysler workers in North America, including strikers, remained idle after the production shifts on Monday.</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers analyst Joseph Phillippi estimated that the strike so far has cost Chrysler over $300 million in lost profits, a figure mounting by $15 million to $20 million a day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, talks to resolve a 24-day strike at GM's Oklahoma City car assembly plant, appeared to move beyond cursory issues to the heart of the dispute -- jobs -- said Yvonne Smith, vice president of UAW Local 1999.</p>
<p>"They've just really started to address the manpower issues," Smith said.</p>
<p>The Oklahoma City strike by 3,500 workers has curtailed the launch of GM's new Chevrolet Malibu and Oldsmobile Cutlass mid-size sedans, which are important to the automaker's plan to regain U.S. market share this year.</p>
<p>The UAW wants GM to replace some of the 900 jobs eliminated from the plant late last year when it launched production of the new cars. GM, which is trying to cut costs to competitive levels, maintains that it needs fewer workers because the cars' assembly process has been simplified.</p>
<p>In Pontiac, Mich., where a second GM strike started at 11:59 p.m. on April 22, bargainers have yet to delve into similar manpower issues standing in the way of a new local labour contract.</p>
<p>"It's all just menial stuff," a spokesman for UAW Local 594 said of Monday's discussions. About 5,850 workers struck GM's Pontiac East assembly plant, which builds the company's popular full-size, extended-cab Chevrolet and GMC pickup trucks.</p>
<p>Phillippi said he estimates that the Pontiac strike is costing GM about $4.5 million to $5 million a day, while, the Oklahoma City losses are likely to be less.</p>
<p>Investors have largely ignored the losses in recent weeks, keeping both GM and Chrysler shares roughly steady. On the New York Stock Exchange Monday, GM stock closed up 37.5 cents to $55.25, while Chrysler shares closed up 37.5 cents to $29.625.</p>
