<p>China's Premier Li Peng leaves for Moscow this week on a trip aimed at boosting economic links and paving the way for a presidential summit next year.</p>
<p>While politics will take a back seat on Li's visit, both China and Russia stand to gain in a delicate balancing act of their political ties with the West, analysts said on Monday.</p>
<p>"Trade will be the main item on the agenda," said Lu Nanquan, deputy chief director of the Russian Studies Centre of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, a top think tank.</p>
<p>"Both sides need to see an improvement in economic ties," he said.</p>
<p>Li, who starts his three-day visit on Thursday, could become the first foreign leader to meet Yeltsin since the Russian president's return to work on Monday from heart surgery.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's press office said a meeting was possible given the huge importance Moscow gives to improving ties with China.</p>
<p>Officials of both sides have said that economic ties have failed to keep pace with the rapid improvement in political links between the former rivals for the leadership of the world communist movement.</p>
<p>Two-way trade was a modest $6.38 billion in the first nine months of this year, only a small portion of China's nearly $200 billion worth of trade over the same period.</p>
<p>The two nations are still haggling over big-ticket items from nuclear power plants to a natural gas pipeline, and Li's visit may not yield a breakthrough, analysts said.</p>
<p>But both sides are hoping to see enough progress to seal a deal when Chinese President Jiang Zemin meets Russian counterpart Yeltsin in Moscow next spring.</p>
<p>Russian officials in Beijing said there was still a wide gap between the two sides on a previously agreed on plan for China to buy Russian nuclear technology.</p>
<p>Beijing wants the multi-billion dollar deal to use as little cash as possible while Moscow, badly in need of hard currency, is pushing for a more generous payment.</p>
<p>China has said it would switch the site of a nuclear plant using Russian technology in a move that is expected to make the project more commercially viable and ease some of the financial concerns, analysts said.</p>
<p>Russia is looking to make headway on a plan to build a pipeline to carry Siberian natural gas to China while it is also seeking a role in this country's huge Three Gorges dam project.</p>
<p>Officials and analysts said the visit also will have a political theme.</p>
<p>While the two sides need to foster their relations with the West they must also demonstrate some independence to strengthen their hand domestically and on the international stage.</p>
<p>The Russian government has come under pressure from its communist and nationalist opposition alike to abandon what is seen as a pro-Western stance and renew its ties with the former ally of the communist era.</p>
<p>Plans for the expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to include some ex-communist states of eastern Europe have also added new pressure for Moscow's leadership.</p>
<p>"Russia's foreign policy can no longer be pro-Western or pro-Eastern, it should be pro-Russian," a senior Russian Foreign Ministry official told Reuters in Moscow. "In the ideal world it should have trump cards to counterbalance any outside pressure."</p>
<p>Diplomats in Beijing said China had a similar interest in showing it had alternatives to the West, although it would use this lever cautiously.</p>
<p>"China is not going to jeopardise its substantial contacts with the West which provide its key markets and sources of capital and technology," said a Western diplomat.</p>
<p>"But there is certainly some value in showing from time to time that it can call on the goodwill of another important friend."</p>
