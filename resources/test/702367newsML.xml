<p>The French finance ministry is not formally studying any measures to increase corporate taxes at this stage, a ministry source said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"If you are asking, is there today a plan concerning taxation of company profits...no such plan exists," the source, who is close to finance minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, told reporters.  </p>
<p>Government spokeswoman Catherine Trautmann said earlier on Wednesday that France's recently elected Socialists were looking at increasing taxes on companies to help cap the public deficit this year. The remarks triggered a fall in French share prices.</p>
<p>The finance ministry source noted that the government had pledged to shift the burden of taxation off the cost of labour and onto capital. "We have some reference points," he said.</p>
<p>But the government had no desire to increase the tax burden and wanted to maintain the competitiveness of French companies. If the government were to change taxation on companies, it would have to be in this context. "We are not there yet. Today there is no proposal being studied," the source said.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn told reporters later that nothing had been decided on any budget changes and that the government was "awaiting calmly" the results of an audit of public finances due on July 21.</p>
