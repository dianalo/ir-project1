<p>Warm, dry weather allowed a lot of fieldwork to get done in Montana during the week to Sunday, according to the Montana agricultural statistics service in its weekly crop update.</p>
<p>"Small grain seeding is approaching normal levels. There were a few reports of areas in need of rain to start off the spring grains," the report said.</p>
<p>Spring wheat was 62 percent planted, up from 29 percent a week earlier but still behind the five-year average of 73 percent. Twelve percent had emerged, down from a five year average of 28 percent.</p>
<p>Barley was 60 percent planted, up from 28 percent a week earlier but behind the average of 69 percent. Eight percent had emerged, versus a normal 27 percent.</p>
<p>"Central leaf beetle activity was reported in the south central part of the state, which is earlier than normal," the report noted.</p>
<p>Sugarbeets were 94 percent planted, slightly ahead of the average of 87 percent.</p>
<p>Winter wheat ratings declined slightly with 56 percent good or excellent, down from 63 percent a week earlier.</p>
