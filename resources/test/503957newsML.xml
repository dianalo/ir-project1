<p>Spanish companies Endesa, Iberdola &amp; Union Fenosa have shown interest in participating in the coming privatisation of EDP-Electricidade de Portugal, the company's chairman said in a newspaper interview.</p>
<p>Antonio de Almeida told Diario Economico that the three companies "wanted to participate in the capital of EDP, inside the limit set down of five percent".</p>
<p>De Almeida said that he favoured an exchange of share holdings with companies that became part of an eventual hard core of stakeholders in the electricity concern, whose partial privatisation is set for June.</p>
<p>The government has set a ceiling of five percent for any future individual holding, other than the state, in the government-owned concern.</p>
