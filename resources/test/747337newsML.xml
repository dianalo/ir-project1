<p>Greece's registered unemployment fell to 6.8 percent in May from 8.5 percent in April, not seasonally adjusted, and the number of registered unemployed dropped to 182,280 in May from 210,494, the central bank said.</p>
<p>Registered unemployment stood at 6.3 percent in May 1996 when 157,401 people were registered as unemployed, it said in its July bulletin of coincidental indicators.</p>
<p>Greece's registered unemployment rate is volatile and is widely regarded as underestimating the actual rate. Registered unemployment figures are provided by the labour ministry.</p>
<p>Greece's unemployment rose to 10.4 percent in 1996 from 10 percent in 1995 based on annual data from the National Statistics Service. --Dimitris Kontogiannis, Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
