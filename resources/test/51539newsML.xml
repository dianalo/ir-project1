<p>Bob Dole's campaign challenge over President Bill Clinton's health records prompted a White House scramble on Friday, while outsider candidate Ross Perot drew boos from the powerful Christian Coalition.</p>
<p>Clinton's staff was looking for ways to release more information about the president's health, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said after complaints by Republican presidential candidate Dole.</p>
<p>"The president is in excellent overall health. And it's apparent to us we're going to have to do whatever it takes to satisfy you and the American public that that's true," McCurry told reporters.</p>
<p>Dole threw down the gauntlet on Thursday by suggesting that Clinton's refusal to release his full medical record showed he was hiding something: "Let's have your health records, Mr. President. I gave them all of mine."</p>
<p>Dole, who at age 73 has worked to shore up his image as a vital survivor in the peak of health, has previously claimed to be more measurably fit than the 50-year-old Clinton.</p>
<p>The White House typically releases numerous details of Clinton's annual physical examinations, such as his weight, cholesterol and blood pressure, but McCurry said earlier that other details had been withheld to preserve Clinton's privacy.</p>
<p>Clinton spent the day at the White House, conferring with foreign policy advisers on the situation in Iraq, while Dole was out on the hustings in Ohio and Michigan, pledging to make trade policy a campaign issue.</p>
<p>"We've seen the trade deficit grow and grow and grow in the Clinton administration," Dole told a factory audience in Ohio, adding that a tougher trade policy would go hand-in-hand with his tax-cutting economic programme to create jobs.</p>
<p>"When you add it all up, we think it's going to create the growth that we need in America," Dole said.</p>
<p>In Washington, the conservative Christian Coalition urged presidential candidates to stress personal morality and family values, not just taxes and the economy.</p>
<p>"This election is not about a poverty in our pocketbooks, it is about a poverty in our souls," said coalition executive director Ralph Reed. "It's about the breakup of the family. The coarsening of our culture, a loss of civility, a loss of innocence, a loss of values and it is about a moral crisis that ails the heart and the soul of America."</p>
<p>The group, which claims 1.7 million members, gave a cool reception to billionaire Perot when he tried to discount the impression that his 1992 candidacy helped put Clinton in the White House.</p>
<p>Speaking as the crowd booed, the Reform Party's candidate pleaded: "I ask you, as honest Christian people, to please go to the library and study the exit polls from the 1992 election. You will find I drew equally from both candidates."</p>
<p>A CNN/USA Today/Gallup tracking poll showed Clinton with a 23 point lead in a three-way race, with 55 percent of likely voters favouring him; Dole had 32 percent and Perot got six percent. The poll had a margin of error of four percentage points.</p>
