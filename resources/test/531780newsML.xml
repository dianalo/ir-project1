<p>Brazil's highest court, the Supreme Federal Tribunal (STF), threw out a constitutional challenge to the upcoming privatization of state mining company CVRD, a court official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a preliminary decision before ruling on the merits of the case itself, the court decided there were no grounds for the challenge brought by a private lawyers group.  </p>
<p>The court is also expected to rule on an appeal by the government against an injunction issued Tuesday by a Supreme Federal Tribunal justice. The injunction suspends the federal land transfer to CVRD of 411,000 hectares of land in the Carajas mining region in the northern state of Para.</p>
<p>Another constitutional challenge to the privatization of CVRD, or Companhia Vale do Rio Doce SA, is due to be studied by the high court at a later date. That challenge was also lodged by the lawyers group, the Order of Brazilian Lawyers.</p>
