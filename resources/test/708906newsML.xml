<p>Vietnam's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday that Cambodia's Second Prime Minister Hun Sen was currently on vacation in Vietnam.</p>
<p>"At the moment Mr. Hun Sen is in Vietnam. This is a vacation, simply a private trip," a ministry spokesman said in a statement. Hun Sen was a senior leader in the Vietnamese-backed government in Cambodia which took over from the Khmer Rouge in 1979.  </p>
<p>Communist-ruled Vietnam invaded Cambodia at the end of 1978 and withdrew its forces in 1989.</p>
<p>The Foreign Ministry gave no details of Hun Sen's whereabouts, and the Cambodian ambassador in Hanoi said he had not been informed of any visit by the second prime minister.</p>
<p>Earlier, Hun Sen said in a radio broadcast heard in Phnom Penh that his rival, First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, was trying to smuggle defectors from the Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement into the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. It was not clear from where Hun Sen was speaking.</p>
<p>Troops from both sides clashed on the northwestern outskirts of Phnom Penh earlier on Saturday. Hun Sen said the fighting did not signal civil war.</p>
