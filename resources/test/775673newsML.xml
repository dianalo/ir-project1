<p>Contracts on Shanghai's treasury bill repurchase market closed mostly lower on Monday on enlarged trading volume after a new A share issue on the Shenzhen stock exchange fanned short-term fund demand, traders said.</p>
<p>The annual rate for the most actively traded seven-day contract fell to 8.04 percent from 9.00 percent on Friday.</p>
<p>Total turnover on the six-contract market soared to 4.72 million lots from 1.74 million lots.</p>
<p>One lot is 1,000 yuan face value of treasury bills.  </p>
<p>Shenzhen Hua Qiao Chen issued 45 million A shares for trading in Shenzhen, fuelling demand for short-term funds and particularly supporting the three-day contract, traders said.</p>
<p>"Heavy institutional borrowing pushed up both volume and rates of early-maturing contracts," one trader said.</p>
<p>The seven-day contract fell mainly due to institutional selling just before the close, and traders said they saw rates falling slightly in the next few days on a lack of market-moving news.</p>
<p>Contracts on the T-bill spot market ended mostly lower because the new A share issue sucked out short-term funds.  </p>
<p>The most actively traded 10-year bond that matures in June 2006 rose to 112.74 yuan from 112.80 yuan.</p>
<p>Combined volume on the eight-contract market fell to 772,163 million lots from 1.47 million lots.</p>
<p>The strong performance of A share markets was another factor pushing down both volume and prices, traders said.</p>
<p>They said they expected the spots to linger around current levels in the next few days.</p>
