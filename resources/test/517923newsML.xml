<p>German shares ended trade on Thursday at higher lvels, albeit off earlier highs, after chalking up solid gains on data which indicated slower than expected economic growth in the first quarter of the year.</p>
<p>The IBIS DAX index ended up 14.26 points at 3,361.80 points, while June DAX DTB futures ended up 19 points at 3,376 points.</p>
<p>Shares were also buoyed by advances in the German bond market, which remained firm after the Bundesbank decided to leave its key interest rates unchanged and statements at the Bundesbank's news conference were positively received.</p>
<p>Earlier the DAX index ended up 29.80 points at 3,383.25 points, building on a stable start in pre-bourse trade despite sharp declines on car giant Daimler-Benz AG.</p>
<p>Daimler ended down 1.96 percent, or 2.65 marks, at 132.35 marks. It released 1996 earnings on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dealers said some of Daimler's news, including plans for a convertible note issue, had proved disappointing, especially in the light of the recent rally among German car shares.</p>
<p>The overall market got a boost from a report showing the Ifo institute's business climate index fell to 92.4 in March from 93.6, far below expectations for a figure of around 94.0.</p>
<p>Shares in BMW AG, which has had a good run of late in common with other car stocks, ended down 18 marks at 1,407 marks.</p>
<p>BMW chief Bernd Pischetsrieder said on Wedesday that BMW was expecting "slight" earnings growth in 1997, a comment he clarified as meaning single digit percent growth.</p>
<p>Airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG issued a statement from the company saying its 1997 results would be above those in 1996. Its shares ended down 10 pfennigs at 22.49 marks.</p>
