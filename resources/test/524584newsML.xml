<p>Chinese lawmakers are drafting a law to protect commercial secrets as part of moves to curb unhealthy competition in the nation's new market-style economy, the People's Daily Overseas Edition said on Monday.</p>
<p>The Law on the Protection of Commercial Secrets would be based largely on an existing accord guarding intellectual property rights and would differ little from principles accepted by most other countries, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>As China moved to curb unhealthy competition the focus was shifting from cracking down on fake and shoddy goods to protecting commercial information, it said.</p>
<p>The Supreme People's Court would work to summarise several years of case experience to provide judicial explanation of issues related to commercial secrets before the draft law was put forward for approval, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>It gave no details of when the law might be passed or go into force.</p>
