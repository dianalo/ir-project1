<p>The dollar fell sharply by around one yen to 113.80 yen in early Tokyo trading on Wednesday in reaction to stronger-than-expected figures in the Bank of Japan's "tankan" quarterly survey of corporate sentiment released on earlier in the morning.</p>
<p>The diffusion index for big manufacturers, a key gauge of business confidence, rose to plus seven in June from plus two in March, when the previous survey was conducted. In March, the survey had forecast a manufacturers' diffusion index of minus one for June.</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at around 114.90/95 yen in late New York on Tuesday.</p>
