<p>Troubled Canadian retailer T. Eaton Co Ltd said on Wednesday it had decided to shutter only 17 of 31 department stores facing possible closure as part of its attempt to restructure under creditor protection.</p>
<p>President George Kosich, who came on board in early May after holding the same position at rival Hudson's Bay Co, said more Eaton's outlets would be kept open than originally outlined after he reviewed all 86 stores and warehouses nation-wide.</p>
<p>Eaton's, which has already closed six locations, has been holding talks with landlords and local politicians.</p>
<p>The 127-year-old T. Eaton Co, Canada's fifth largest department store chain, filed for bankruptcy protection on February 27 and now owes about C$400 million to banks and creditors.</p>
<p>"I am especially pleased that we are able to maintain a larger network of stores than might have seemed possible at the outset," Kosich said in a news release.</p>
<p>"Our goal throughout the store review process was to remain in those locations we could continue to operate on a viable business basis," he said. "As a result of our discussions with relevant stakeholders, each of the stores going forward can meet that test."</p>
<p>Eaton's, privately owned by the wealthy Eaton family, must present the court with a restructuring plan by the August 15 deadline.</p>
<p>"It is increasingly clear that our stakeholders want this restructuring process to succeed and to produce a strong and viable Eaton's going forward," Kosich said. "We intend to table a fair and reasonable restructuring plan that will merit their support and achieve that result."</p>
