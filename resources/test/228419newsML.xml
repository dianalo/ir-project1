<p>Chinese Premier Li Peng has called for development of nuclear power to convert military technology to civilian use, state media said on Monday.</p>
<p>"The development of the nuclear power industry is important for the sector to convert military technology to civilian uses," Li was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Li said China would encourage the development of the nuclear power industry and ensure that it accumulates enough funding, improves its technology and increases its workforce, newspapers and the Xinhua news agency said.</p>
<p>He made the remarks during a tour of a nuclear power plant in Qinshan in the eastern province of Zhejiang last week, the media said.</p>
<p>An official of the Qinshan nuclear power plant, reached by telephone, said some military personnel involved in the production of nuclear weapons had been transferred and were now involved in nuclear power generation.</p>
<p>Qinshan is China's first domestically designed and built nuclear power plant.</p>
<p>The first phase of the plant went into operation in 1991, with an installed capacity of 300 megawatts. China earlier this year began construction of a second phase designed to add two 600-megawatt generating units by 2003. The third phase plans to add two 700-megawatt generators.</p>
<p>Nuclear power currently accounts for less than one percent of China's energy needs, but Beijing has said it would build a world-class nuclear industry this decade.</p>
<p>It has pledged to boost nuclear capacity to 20,000 megawatts by 2020. Current capacity is about 2,100 megawatts.</p>
