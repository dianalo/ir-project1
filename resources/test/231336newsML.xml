<p>Ohio Gov. George Voinovich has signed into law a bill that contains provisions allowing one Ohio city to divert revenues from a tax increment financing district and Ohio counties to issue bonds backed by sales tax revenues.</p>
<p>The provisions were contained in a corrective bill passed by lawmakers last month and signed by Voinovich Monday.</p>
<p>While the law does not specify which local governments would be impacted by the provisions, legislative aides said the TIF provision was written with Columbus in mind and the sales tax bonding provision with Hamilton County in mind.</p>
<p>John Fischer, a partner at Peck, Schaffer &amp; Williams, Hamilton County's bond counsel, said Tuesday the bonding provision will enable the county to use revenues from a sales tax increase approved by voters in March to help finance two new professional sports stadiums estimated to cost $544 million.</p>
<p>He said that the provision, which applies to all counties in Ohio, gives counties the statutory authority to sell sales tax bonds for capital projects.</p>
<p>Hamilton County plans to issue about $300 million of bonds to help finance new stadiums for the Cincinnati Reds baseball team and Cincinnati Bengals football team. Fischer said no financing is expected until the spring. In the meantime, the county is finalizing site selection, he added.</p>
<p>As for the TIF provision, Shawn Bunt, legislative aide to State Rep. E.J. Thomas, R-Columbus, the bill's sponsor, said the provision only allows one Ohio city, which he said is expected to be Columbus, to use revenues from a TIF district to fund a public improvement outside of the district.</p>
<p>Columbus officials were not available to comment on the matter.</p>
<p>Bunt said the city must pass an ordinance and receive approval from landowners within the affected TIF district in order to take advantage of the provision. He added that the provision had been watered down from another bill that would have allowed any Ohio city to divert TIF funds.</p>
<p>Thomas is expected to reintroduce that bill during the next session, Bunt said.</p>
