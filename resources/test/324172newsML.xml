<p>A Zimbabwean health official on Wednesday blamed a two-month strike by doctors and nurses for the deaths of some of the 2,630 people he said had died at the country's two largest public hospitals during the strike.</p>
<p>"As a result of the strike people died in unparalleled proportions," acting health and child welfare secretary Thomas Zigora said in an affidavit filed in the High Court in the case of seven hospital workers who are challenging their summary dismissal over the strike.</p>
<p>"Sick and dying people were simply turned away. For the applicants to say they had the concern of patients and citizens at heart is rather ridiculous," Zigora said.</p>
<p>Union officials were unavailable for comment on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Zimbabwean government summarily dismissed nurses and junior doctors for taking part in the strike which began on October 21, paralysing the southern African country's public hospitals for two months.</p>
<p>Some of the strikers were later reinstated after meeting government conditions but it is still unclear how many were not taken back. Union officials estimated that 10,000 nurses and doctors took part in the strike.</p>
<p>Zigora said the 2,630 people died at Zimbabwe's two largest public hospitals -- Parirenyatwa and Harare Central. No comparative figures were available.</p>
<p>According to Zigora, many wards at Parirenyatwa Hospital, including the key maternity wing, were still closed for lack of staff.</p>
