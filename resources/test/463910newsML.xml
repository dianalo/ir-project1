<p>Columbia Laboratories Inc said Monday it was not aware of any problem concerning its New Drug Application for Crinone, its vaginally delivered natural progesterone system.</p>
<p>The company said the application was progressing through the review process at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as would be expected for an application granted priority review.</p>
<p>It said it continues to expect Crinone to be approved on a timely basis.  </p>
<p>The company said it initially made the statements during a conference call Friday in response to a drug industry analyst's comments regarding the regulatory status of Crinone.</p>
<p>With respect to the same analyst's comments regarding the company's "cumbersome" manufacturing operations, Columbia Labs said the same facilities producing Crinone have produced millions of applicators of Replens and Advantage 24 during the last five years, and it has never experienced manufacturing problems with these products.</p>
<p>In addition, the Crinone manufacturing facilities were inspected by the FDA prior to the FDA's approval of the Treatment Protocol, the company said.</p>
<p>It said it is distributing Crinone to U.S. fertility clinics pursuant to the Treatment Protocol approved by the FDA on February 7, 1997.  Pursuant to the Treatment Protocol, Crinone will be distributed to 35 centers for use in up to 100 patients per center.</p>
