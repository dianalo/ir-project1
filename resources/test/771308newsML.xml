<p>Recently red hot Taiwan share prices soared past the 10,000 threshold to close at a seven-year peak behind strong buyings in trend-setting electronics and financials, brokers said.</p>
<p>The market, boosted by rallies on Wall Street and in Hong Kong, rose above 10,000 points shortly after the opening and maintained its momentum all the way to the close.</p>
<p>It finished with a gain of 123.56 points or 1,24 percent to 10,066.35, the index's highest level since it registered 10,907.09 close on April 4, 1990.  </p>
<p>Turnover was heavy at T$192.2 billion.</p>
<p>"Despite some late profit-taking, bellwether electronics were able to stand firm," said Oliver Fang, senior analyst for National Securities.</p>
<p>Microchip giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co closed T$5 higher to T$155 as investors brushed off recent concerns over a plan by Dutch Philips Electronics NV to sell 100 million shares of the chipmaker.</p>
<p>Rival chipmaker United Microelectronics  2303.TW finished T$3.5 higher at T$136 despite some late-profit taking.  </p>
<p>Brokers said Taiwan Semiconductor and United Micro were widely viewed as key indicators for the electronics index, which closed 2.63 percent higher.</p>
<p>Computer giant Acer Inc gained T$4.5 to T$104.5.</p>
<p>Heavily weighted financials rebounded from Wednesday's loss, rising 0.55 percent with the "big three" state banks ending a recent streak of malaise triggered by the finance ministry's lan to sell 61 million of the banks' shares.</p>
<p>The ministry said on Wednesday the shares it planned to sell would comprise no more than one percent of the banks' total shares, and therefore should have little effect on the market.  </p>
<p>"The ministry's comment relieved some investors," Lin Long-hsien, senior analyst for United Securities.</p>
<p>The "big three", Chang Hwa Bank, First Bank and Hua Nan Bank, all ended their recent slide and closed unchanged at T$123, T$123 and T$133, respectively.</p>
<p>Construction and paper shares closed sharply higher, gaining 5.05 and 3.38 percent, respectively.  </p>
<p>Brokers said constructions' rally was fuelled by a bullish comment on the industry made by a tycoon of the ruling Nationalist Party.</p>
<p>Liu Tai-ying, chairman of the party's Business Management Committee, said on Wednesday the stock index's 10,000-point level was "healthy", and low-priced construction shares in particular enjoyed strong growth potential.</p>
<p>Brokers said the Taiwan dollar's recent fall against the greenback also contributed to Thursday's rally.</p>
<p>"The fall would boost the competitiveness of Taiwan's products overseas," Lei Pei-yu of Pacific Securities said.  </p>
<p>The Taiwan dollar continued its downtrend on Thurday, sliding to T$28.599 against the greenback at midday. It closed below T$28 for the first time since 1989 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Brokers said they expected the index to launch a brief consolidation on Friday before seeking another higher upside.</p>
<p>A 10,000-10,100 range was seen.</p>
