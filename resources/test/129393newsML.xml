<p>Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's cabinet approved a draft anti-corruption bill on Sunday, a government minister said.</p>
<p>Information minister Khalid Ahmed Khan Kharal told a news conference the bill would be submitted to the National Assembly (lower house of parliament) later on Sunday.</p>
<p>He did not release a text of the bill, but said it aimed to provide a "comprehensive system of across-the-board accountability" of public office-holders in Pakistan since the military coup of July 5, 1977.</p>
<p>That was when General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq overthrew then prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir's father. Zia, who executed Bhutto in 1979, later became president and ruled Pakistan for 11 years until his death in a mystery plane crash.</p>
<p>"The draft bill aims at preventing corrupt practices and provides a comprehensive procedure for trial and punishment for such practices," Kharal said.</p>
<p>Any constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament and the bill would therefore need support from the opposition to reach the statute book.</p>
<p>Kharal quoted Bhutto as saying she hoped the bill would deter future corruption as well as punish its past exponents.</p>
<p>Bhutto has frequently denied opposition charges that her three-year-old government is tainted with corruption.</p>
<p>The government has produced its anti-corruption bill under pressure from President Farooq Leghari, once seen as a Bhutto ally. Last month he urged government and opposition to cooperate in setting up parliamentary committees to tackle graft.</p>
<p>He proposed several legislative changes, including an amendment to bar those found guilty of misconduct from public office for seven years.</p>
<p>His action was seen as a rare step into the political fray for a president who had kept a low profile since he was elected after Bhutto came to power in October 1993.</p>
<p>Pakistan Muslim League leader Nawaz Sharif had earlier demanded a permanent judicial commission to probe corruption charges against government politicians and bureaucrats. Bhutto had said existing mechanisms were adequate.</p>
