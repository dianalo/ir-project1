<p>Asian MTBE prices slipped to their lowest level in at least six months in the face of ample supplies but market sentiment has improved following firmer U.S prices over the past few days, traders said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The U.S. market has gone up by a few cents (per gallon) over the past two days and sellers here are trying to push the market up on the back of this," said a trader.</p>
<p>Free-on-board (fob) Singapore MTBE for June lifting was assessed at between $245 and $255 per tonne, down from $250-$260 last week.  </p>
<p>Traders said the arbitrage for export to the U.S. is almost open and this may provide a much needed outlet for regional barrels, in the wake of large exports from Saudi Arabia to this market.</p>
<p>"I think some of the spot Malaysian barrels may be heading to the U.S. market," a trader said.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia is raising the level of its exports to Asia as it lays the ground ahead of the start up of a worldscale plant later this week, traders said.  </p>
<p>The 700,000 tonne per year Sadaf plant in Al Jubail, is a joint venture between Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) and Royal Dutch Shell.</p>
<p>But fresh product from the start up of the new plant might be offset by news that a 700,000-tonne-per-year methanol plant in Ar Razi was shutdown last Friday following a technical problem.</p>
<p>Saad Al Youssef, a spokesman for SABIC said the plant would re-open May 17. It is part of a 1.4 million tonnes per year methanol complex.  </p>
<p>The closed plant provides feedstock to a similar sized MTBE plant in that area, but traders said they did not know if operations were affected.</p>
<p>The new 50,000-tonne-per-year Singapore plant is going through start-up problems and restarted late last week after a two week shutdown.</p>
<p>Despite the additional supplies, market sentiment was also boosted slightly by Taiwan's decision to award two six-month term cargoes late last week, traders said.  </p>
<p>State-owned Chinese Petroleum Corp (CPC) awarded two contracts for the supply of between three to five cargoes of 3,500 tonnes of MTBE for delivery between July to December 1997 at between minus $2 and minus $4 per tonne below average U.S. Gulf and North West European prices, on a cost-and-freight basis.</p>
<p>Thailand's Bangchak Petroleum on Tuesday issued its monthly tender to buy 1,500 tonnes of MTBE for June delivery closing on May 14.</p>
