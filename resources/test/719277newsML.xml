<p>Indonesia's move to curb loans to the property developers is seen as a pre-emptive strike against a possible Thai-style financial crisis triggered by rising bank loans to the sector, property analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Analysts, however, said Indonesia's property sector was unlikely to face a slump, with its destabilising effects on the overall economy, due to continued strong economic fundamentals.</p>
<p>"The loan curb should be seen as a pre-emptive move to limit the fast growth in property loans, but there should be no undue worries as the sector should remain healthy," Bayu Utomo, a property analyst with property consultants PT Procon Indah/Jones Lang Wootton, said.</p>
<p>"The Indonesian property sector should remain generally healthy as strong economic growth of around seven percent this year should further boost demand in the sector," another property analyst with a foreign brokerage firm said.</p>
<p>Indonesia's central bank governor Sudradjad Djiwandono said on Wednesday a curb on property loans was needed because a policy of moral suasion had not been effective enough.</p>
<p>The central bank announced earlier that commercial banks were not allowed to allocate new loans to property developers for land procurement and development, except for low-cost housing.</p>
<p>Soedrajad said earlier the average loan growth of local banks was currently about 23-24 percent a year, while loan growth for the property sector was around 34-35 percent.</p>
<p>In May 1997, property loans comprised 19.7 percent of total bank loans, while four years ago it was about 13 percent, Soedrajad said.</p>
<p>The main reason for the curb was likely due to the fast growth in property loans, but Indonesian banks' exposure to the sector remained below many other countries in the region, Procon Indah's Bayu said.</p>
<p>Another analyst said exposure to the property sector accounted for about 20 percent of the loan books of Indonesian banks, which is far below around 50 percent in Hong Kong and some 30 percent in Singapore.</p>
<p>Bayu said overall demand for property should remain high due to continuing healthy levels of economic growth and direct investment approvals.</p>
<p>The World Bank said in its 1997 report on the country that on the basis of broad macroeconomic indicators, Indonesia's economy had performed very well recently.</p>
<p>"Gross domestic product increased, inflation dropped and local and foreign investments have been increasingly bouyant," the Bank said in the report.</p>
<p>But the World Bank also referred to concern over the rate of exposure of Indonesia's banks in the property sector.</p>
<p>During the first quarter of 1997, demand in most sectors of the Jakarta property market remained bouyant, stronger than in the corresponding period of 1996, Bayu said.</p>
