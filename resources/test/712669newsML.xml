<p>Zimbabwean shares traded mixed to firmer in an active market on Tuesday with brokers seeing some profit-taking creeping in.</p>
<p>The key industrial index put on 2.01 points to end at 10,906.94.</p>
<p>"Some profit taking is starting to come in and we expect to see more of it towards the end of the week," one broker said.</p>
<p>"But today the market was looking firm with most counters looking strong," he added.</p>
<p>Amongst the day's winners, finance house Finhold and constructions and plastics investor IHL rose 50 cents each to 750 and 2,450 respectively, Alloys gained 25 cents to 300 as did tea producer Tanganda to 825 and blue-chip hotels and supermarkets conglomerate Delta added 15 cents to 1,825.</p>
<p>Against the trend, merchant banker FMB slid 500 cents to 4,500 on what brokers said was a lack of buyers ahead of an FMB Holdings extraordinary general meeting on July 21 expected to approve the bank's merger with Heritage Investment Bank.</p>
<p>The two banks signed an agreement last month to merge their operations under which Anglo American Corporation Zimbabwe will reduce its shareholding in FMB to 10 percent from the current 42.9 percent.</p>
<p>Also among the day's losers on the local exchange, clothing retailer Edgars dropped 30 cents to 750, electronics and communications firm Apex lost 25 cents to 275 and sugar refinery ZSR shed 15 cents to 1,650.</p>
<p>Minings were more active than of late with Falgold putting on four cents to 70. But gold investor Falcon dropped 400 cents to 1,000, dragged down by a lustreless bullion.</p>
<p>The mining index ended 2.02 points up at 871.08.</p>
