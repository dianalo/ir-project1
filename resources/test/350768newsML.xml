<p>Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko said on Monday Ukraine wanted concrete security guarantees from NATO in a special deal being prepared with the alliance.</p>
<p>Udovenko was speaking after meeting British Defence Secretary Michael Portillo on the second and final day of his visit to Kiev for talks on European security and Ukraine's role in the light of NATO's plans to expand eastwards.</p>
<p>Udovenko told reporters Ukraine was "very interested in a concrete mechanism of security guarantees" from NATO.</p>
<p>"Now we are talking about political consultations. That's a kind of security guarantee too," he added.</p>
<p>Portillo said on Sunday the new deal could allow the two sides to "examine together threats to world peace" and "discuss where action together was appropriate".</p>
<p>Russian parliamentarians and other political figures, especially Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov who is seen as a potential candidate in any presidential election race, have claimed the Crimean port of Sevastopol as Russian territory.</p>
<p>Sevastopol is home to the former Soviet Black Sea fleet, whose division has strained relations between the neighbouring Slav countries ever since the Soviet Union split up in 1991.</p>
<p>Ukraine, like Russia, is negotiating a special deal with NATO but unlike Russia it does not oppose its expansion though it wants a nuclear-free zone in central and eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Portillo said he hoped the two deals would be signed simultaneously either before or at a NATO summit in Madrid in July where new members will be invited to join.</p>
<p>"I am very confident that we could make good progress on the agreement between NATO and Ukraine. I don't yet know what progress we can make with the agreement between NATO and Russia," Portillo said.</p>
<p>He made clear the alliance wanted to encourage closer ties with both Russia and Ukraine but warned Moscow, which has repeatedly opposed NATO expansion, that there was no going back.</p>
<p>"We shall work tirelessly within NATO to try to bring about that agreement (with Russia). We have to express one thing very clearly to Russia. The decision about the enlargement of NATO is going to be taken on time in July 1997. NATO is not going to change its mind," he said.</p>
