<p>Forget exotic foods such as ginseng, shark's fin and bird's nest soup -- the secret of long life is instant noodles, says a 103-year-old Hong Kong woman.</p>
<p>Lee Kok-fit told a banquet of 3,500 elderly, all aged over 73, that instant noodles were the staple that kept her going, the South China Morning Post newspaper said on Friday.</p>
<p>Lee had been known to turn away many freshly cooked Chinese dishes in favour of instant noodles, it said.</p>
<p>Many Chinese resort to obscure medicines or exotic foods to promote long life. Thursday's annual gathering of the elderly was to mark Yan Yat, the seventh day of the Lunar New Year.</p>
