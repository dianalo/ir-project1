<headline>Port Authority of NY-NJ delays and trims bond sale.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-20</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said Thursday it was delaying the sale of airport improvement bonds until April and also had trimmed the offering's size to $920 million from around $1.2 billion.</p>
<p>"We don't know the exact date but we now expect those bonds to be issued in early to mid-April," said a spokesman for the Authority, which runs terminals and transportation. This is the second time the bond sale was delayed.  </p>
<p>Initially, the Authority had planned to sell the debt in December, but the transaction was delayed until the first quarter of 1997 due to its complexity.</p>
<p>No explanation for the sale's second delay or for the reduction in the offering's size was immediately available.</p>
<p>The bi-state agency had approved the bonds in November to finance a new international arrivals building at John F. Kennedy Airport in the Borough of Queens in New York City. Lehman Brothers and Citicorp were chosen to lead the underwriters.</p>
