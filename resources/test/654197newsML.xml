<headline>INSIGHT - Dlr/yen shaky as major 110 support looms.</headline>

<p>Dollar/yen remains weak and looks set to test strong support around 110 yen after falling to its lowest level since November 1996, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>"Dollar/yen has major support in the 110/109 area, and I expect it to go to 110 where it might form a major bottom for a strong recovery," said Stefan Steinemann, technical analyst at Lloyds Bank in Geneva.</p>
<p>At 0755 GMT the dollar was at 110.70/80, down from 112.43/53 in late European trading on Tuesday. Dollar/mark was at 1.7130/40 from 1.7186/93.</p>
<p>Despite its rapid decline the dollar has strong support below 111 yen, chartists said. The lower boundary of an ascending trend channel, drawn from the all-time low at 79.76 of April 1995, cuts in at 110.80. Below there, a solid prop is at 110.65, an Elliot wave support.</p>
<p>Below 110, the dollar has support in the 109.20 area, a 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement of its entire move from the record lows to the 1997 high of 127.46 on May 1.</p>
<p>Alan Dunne, technical analyst at Bank of America, said the move below the previous low at 111.85 confirmed the formation of a bear flag, setting up a target at 108 and then 106.</p>
<p>Dollar/mark also looks poised to extend its decline from the 1.7210 high on Tuesday but has support in the 1.7085/50 band, an area of dense congestion dating back to May.</p>
<p>"The dollar is likely to test support at 1.7050 but recover from there," said Steinemann. He sees critical support at 1.7020, which if eroded would signal a sharp dollar sell-off to 1.6800. The 1.7020 level is this week's cycle low from Monday.</p>
<p>Eddie Matts, director at Capital Management, said the loss of 1.7110 deferred the uptrend and a final drop to 1.6850.</p>
<p>Upticks face resistance at 1.7160 and 1.7275, a 61.8 percent retracement of the previous decline from 1.7423.</p>
