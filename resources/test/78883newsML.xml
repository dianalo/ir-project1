<p>Republican Bob Dole's campaign manager, Scott Reed, accused President Clinton Thursday of wanting to have the fewest possible presidential debates in front of the smallest possible audience.</p>
<p>The accusation, in a letter to Clinton campaign manager Peter Knight, came as the two sides continued to squabble over minor details of the debates, the first of which is scheduled for Oct. 6 in Hartford, Connecticut.</p>
<p>"We know President Clinton's highest priority is to have the least number of debates before the smallest possible audience," Reed wrote.</p>
<p>The Dole campaign wants to move up the time of the second debate, scheduled for Oct. 16 in San Diego, by 45 minutes to avoid clashing with a baseball playoff game.</p>
<p>The Dole team also wants the candidates to stand behind a "writing platform" to accomodate Dole, who has difficulty taking notes because of a war wound. The San Diego debate is planned as a "town hall meeting" where the candidates answer questions from undecided voters.</p>
<p>Reed accused Commerce Secretary Mickey Kantor, the head of the Clinton debate negotiating team, of "arrogance and deceitfulness" in refusing to accomodate Dole's request.</p>
<p>But Clinton campaign spokesman Joe Lockhart said the Dole team was trying to change the deal the sides made last weekend when they agreed on the debates.</p>
<p>"As soon as we open up the deal, we're going to find 10 more demands from their side. Right now we're wondering if they really want a debate," he said.</p>
<p>"If they want to formally reopen negotiations, they should come out and say so. Writing an obnoxious letter is not going to get anyone anywhere," Lockhart said.</p>
<p>As far as the desk is concerned, Lockhart said the parties had agreed that the bipartisan commission on presidential debates would design a three-sided writing structure, which both campaigns then had the right to approve.</p>
<p>The clash was seen as unlikely to derail the debates.</p>
<p>Clinton, campaigning in Philadelphia, told reporters later Wednesday he was certain the debates would take place.</p>
<p>"There'll be debates. I'm sure there will," he said.</p>
