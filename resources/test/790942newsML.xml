<p>Uganda's shilling weakened to a record low for this year against the dollar on Monday because of a surge in demand for dollars, dealers said.</p>
<p>The shilling was posted at a commercial average of 1,092.5 against the dollar from 1,085 on Friday. Against the pound, the shilling was posted at a mean rate of 1,730 from 1,715.</p>
<p>Dealers said the shilling had weakened to its record low this year because of an upsurge in demand for the dollar, partly because investors were buying dollars in Uganda for sale in Kenya.</p>
<p>The Kenyan shilling fell to its record all-time low against the dollar on Thursday after a slide following the International Monetary Fund decision to halt a key aid package on July 31 because of corruption.</p>
<p>Dealders said poor coffee export sales in Uganda recently had led to a drop of dollar inflows and shilling weakness.</p>
