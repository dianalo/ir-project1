<p>European economic and monetary union (EMU) stands an average 79 percent chance of getting off the ground as planned in January 1999, a Reuters poll showed on Tuesday.</p>
<p>And if it does go ahead, the door will likely be opened to as many as 11 countries, well beyond the core of six which many had earlier envisaged as founder members, the poll showed.</p>
<p>"The choice has narrowed. There are now only two scenarios -- a broad group or postponement," said Hans Honig, senior economist at Rabobank International in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>As an abandonment of the project would be negative for the whole of Europe, a broad but timely launch looks imminent, analysts said.</p>
<p>"The most probable scenario is EMU starting on time because the alternative of delay or cancellation is the worst scenario for all countries concerned," said Felix Gonzalez, chief economist at Beta Capital in Madrid.</p>
<p>"We would face a foreign exchange crisis with devaluation of the lira, escudo and peseta, and Germany and France will suffer from these devaluations. There is a risk of another economic crisis," he said.</p>
<p>The 46 economists and political analysts across Europe maintained that the political momentum and the in-built flexibility of the Maastricht Treaty would shuffle the process through.</p>
<p>European heavyweights Germany and France have been struggling to meet the required budget deficit to gross domestic product ratio of three percent, but analysts said this could be glossed over.</p>
<p>"There's nothing in the treaty that says they've got to hit three percent exactly. The Germans are stepping back from that demand for strict interpretation and there's enough political momentum and will to make it (EMU) happen," said Nigel Richardson, international economist at Yamaichi in London.</p>
<p>But the expectation that the criteria will be interpreted flexibly opens the way for the Iberian bloc to enter and clearly divides the "ins" and the "outs", the survey showed.</p>
<p>Respondents were asked to give a percentage likelihood on each country making the grade in time for January 1 1999 and seven countries achieved a median average of 100 percent. These were Germany and France, the Benelux countries, Austria and Ireland.</p>
<p>Finland will almost certainly be included with an average of 90 percent while Spain and Portugal are marching up the ranks with 80 percent each.</p>
<p>"It's not a problem for Portugal and Spain to fulfil the Maastricht criteria in 1997 so there will be no reason to object to their membership," said Gonzalez.</p>
<p>Only Italy is lingering in the middle ground. The Italian government has slashed some 100 trillion lira off the public deficit since April last year, but analysts wonder whether this fiscal austerity can be maintained.</p>
<p>"If they manage to achieve the Maastricht criteria or come close to meeting it for 1997, there will be the question about what happens to it in 1998/99. We feel they may get rejected from the first round," said Yamaichi's Richardson.</p>
<p>But Italy's earlier thin chances of joining have come on in leaps and bounds. More than half of the respondents surveyed said Italy would be there at the start -- by far its highest ranking since the survey began in October last year when just six percent backed Italy.</p>
<p>"Convergence in Italy, Spain and Portugal has been much faster than previously expected," said Rabobank's Honig. "And the problems in France and Germany make it easier for them to join."</p>
<p>Those left -- Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece -- are way out of the picture. Britain and Denmark are rank outsiders, with an average five percent chance of making it on time, while Sweden and Greece are total no-hopers at zero percent.</p>
<p>Denmark and Sweden are expected to join two years after 1999, while it would take Britain three years, the survey showed.</p>
<p>Greece could wait for around four years before joining, although some respondents did not expect to see Greece in EMU within 10 years.</p>
