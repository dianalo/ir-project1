<p>ING Barings said it has downgraded Chilean power distributor Chilectra to hold from buy citing recent sharp price appreciation and limited potential total return.</p>
<p>-- But "strong management and regional expansion plans are signs of Chilectra's strong future prospects," said the report by analysts Pablo Salcedo and Charles Barnett.</p>
<p>-- The company will see a slight decline in operating margins in 1997 as the result of repayments to clients due once the government sets new long-delayed electricity prices, it said.  </p>
<p>Chilectra, Chile's largest power distributor, is around 75 percent owned by power investment firm Enersis. ((-- Margaret Orgill, santiago newsroom, 562-699-5595 x212))</p>
