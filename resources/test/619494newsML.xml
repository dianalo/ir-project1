<p>Polluted water can cause brain damage that turns ordinary people into violent criminals, New Scientist magazine reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>It quoted a U.S. research showing that toxic metals in drinking water were linked to crime rates.</p>
<p>Roger Masters of Dartmouth College in New Hampshire compared crime figures from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with information on industrial discharges of lead and manganese from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p>
<p>He found a definite link between pollution figures and levels of murder, assault and robbery. Counties with the highest pollution levels had crime rates triple the national average.</p>
<p>"The presence of pollution is as big a factor as poverty," Masters told New Scientist.</p>
<p>Masters has written about his findings in a book, Environmental Toxicology, to be published later this year. He says there is a physical basis for the phenomenon.</p>
<p>Experiments have shown lead can inhibit the action of glial cells, which help clean up unwanted chemicals in the brain. Other tests have shown manganese can interfere with levels of the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine -- chemical messengers linked with mood and behaviour.</p>
<p>"It's the breakdown of the inhibition mechanism that's the key to violent behaviour," Masters said.</p>
<p>"This quite likely has something in it," Ken Pease, director of the Applied Criminology Research Unit at the University of Huddersfield, told New Scientist.</p>
<p>"But I think the approach badly needs individual data to nail it down."</p>
