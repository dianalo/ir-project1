<p>When Nguyen Xuan Dung, his wife and four children stepped on to the tarmac at Hanoi airport last year, they were showered with gifts by smiling officials and mobbed by camera-toting journalists.</p>
<p>The officially designated 50,000th migrant to return voluntarily from detention camps in Hong Kong, Dung seemed startled by the effusive welcome.</p>
<p>After all, the hundreds of thousands of boatpeople who fled after the Vietnam War ended in 1975 were castigated by the communist government and the roughly 108,000 who have made the return journey are still viewed with a wary eye.</p>
<p>Eight months later, the fanfare of that August day is just a bitter-sweet memory for 38-year-old Dung and his wife, Nguyen Thi Xuan Thu, as they scratch a meagre living in the northern port town of Haiphong.</p>
<p>"When I first got back I wanted to commit suicide," says Thu as she sits in a gloomy single room that is now home for the family of six. "I didn't want to carry on living."</p>
<p>Thu points to a step in front of their house, where she makes around 40 U.S. cents a day selling rice, and says she is ashamed of her menial work.</p>
<p>"We find that people around here don't like us very much. I'm not keen to get talking with them," she whispers, breaking off in silent tears.</p>
<p>DREAMS OF A BETTER LIFE SHATTERED</p>
<p>Dung and Thu were among 30,000 Haiphong residents who, between 1985 and 1990, crowded into rickety boats and left their lives of poverty and hardship behind them.</p>
<p>But the boatpeoples' dreams were shattered when they arrived in Hong Kong, where they were incarcerated in prison-like camps and then forgotten by the outside world.</p>
<p>Deemed economic migrants rather than political refugees, it was only a matter of time before most would face the choice of voluntary or forced repatriation. China has demanded that the 3,650 or so still in the British colony be gone when Hong Kong returns to Chinese rule at midnight on June 30.</p>
<p>Hoang Van Dinh, director of foreign affairs at the Haiphong People's Committee, says the government promised not to punish returnees for their "fault" and has kept its word.</p>
<p>"There is no discrimination between them and the other people," he says. "We help them to have the economic conditions to earn their living."</p>
<p>But his sympathy runs out when it comes to young returnees who are apparently unwilling to work.</p>
<p>"They got used to being lazy in the camps. They don't want to work. That is very dangerous for our society. They will be street hawkers, beggars and hooligans," he says.</p>
<p>Dinh asserts that many return with "social diseases" that Vietnamese doctors have never seen before and, with a dismissive wave of the hand, says HIV and AIDS victims are not taken back.</p>
<p>UNITED NATIONS SAYS RETURNEES ARE NOT PERSECUTED</p>
<p>The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which has eight expatriate monitors nationwide, says it has recorded interviews with 30 percent of the returnees and reached many more on an informal basis.</p>
<p>It feels satisfied that boatpeople are neither abused nor persecuted.</p>
<p>But just how far the authorities monitor their reintegration into a sometimes suspicious society is less than clear.</p>
<p>Officials did not know where Dung was living and had to track him down through his brother, Nguyen Xuan Hai, in a village outside town.</p>
<p>Hai was forcibly returned from Hong Kong after trying to escape from the colony's once-notorious Whitehead camp. Without a profession and without a job, 32-year-old Hai says he was considered for vocational training in Haiphong but turned it down because it offered theory but no practice.</p>
<p>Would he leave again if he could? Hai shrugs his shoulders.</p>
<p>FINANCIAL HEADACHES</p>
<p>Back in town, Dung's home is hidden away in a bustling backstreet.</p>
<p>The family received around $2,000 from the UNHCR and Hong Kong authorities when their 7-1/2 years in detention came to an end. But half of that sum was swallowed up on renovations to their poky house and the other half was spent on buying Dung a motorbike to become a two-wheel taxi driver.</p>
<p>Looking nervous and smoking a chain of cigarettes, Dung says he had to borrow the equivalent of around $170 from a local moneylender at an interest rate of 24 percent a year.</p>
<p>"I don't know how I will pay it off," he says, adding that he finds it hard to make even the roughly $4.30 a day that the family needs to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Financial difficulties are by no means unusual for the people of a country which, despite the economic advances of the past decade, remains one of the poorest in the world.</p>
<p>Dung and Thu say that while money is their biggest problem, in other respects, things are going well -- the children are settling in and the family is not harassed by the authorities.</p>
<p>But are they glad to be back?</p>
<p>"Everything I do now is for my children," Dung replies. "My own life is over now."</p>
