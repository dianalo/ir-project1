<p>U.S. Treasuries started the week on a firm note on Monday, although the short end lagged somewhat ahead of two- and five-year auctions this week, dealers and analysts said.</p>
<p>"Overall the market has held a good bid. The technical tone has improved going into this week," said a dealer at a Japanese bank in London.</p>
<p>The bellwether 30-year long bond was quoted at 99-18 at 0912 GMT, up from 99-14/15 at the Tokyo finish and 99-12/13 at Friday's close in New York. But the short end underperformed, with the two- to 30-year spread shrinking slightly.</p>
<p>The spread was at 93 basis points down from highs around 96 to 97 last week.</p>
<p>The Treasury is scheduled to auction $18.25 billion of two-year notes on Tuesday and $12.5 billion of five-year paper on Wednesday. Graham McDevitt, senior analyst at Paribas Capital Markets in London, said that the market's previous fears of a U.S. interest rate increase were proving overdone so ultimately the curve could steepen further after the temporary short end underperformance.</p>
<p>"We've been pushing the theme of curve steepness for some time. If the (two-30 spread) could break above 100 it could be heading towards the 130 area," he said.</p>
<p>He said the Eurodollar strip had built up too gloomy a view on U.S. interest rates and as that unwound it would support curve steepening.</p>
<p>Further out, the market was beginning to contemplate not only a victory for President Clinton in the November elections but also a possible Democratic sweep, analysts said.</p>
<p>"As we go into the election, with Clinton still looking to be doing very well, the market's unlikely to sustain a break higher," McDevitt said.</p>
<p>The market's vulnerability is based on the idea that a mandate to boost spending programmes could undermine the fiscal progress that has been made in the U.S., analysts said.</p>
<p>In automated trade, the December U.S. T-bond was at 111-12, up from 111-09 at the prior close in Chicago.</p>
