<p>A state judge sharply limited on Monday the use tobacco companies can make of Florida's history of cigarette-making in state prisons as a means of defending themselves in an anti-tobacco lawsuit.</p>
<p>The ruling knocking down "affirmative defenses" -- in which a defendant seeks to avoid liability by showing a plaintiff shares responsibility for harm -- came on a pre-trial motion in Florida's pioneering lawsuit seeking $1 billion or more in damages for treating state residents with smoking sicknesses.  </p>
<p>At a hearing last month, lawyers for tobacco companies introduced documents showing Florida prisons had for two years during the 1970s made and cigarettes and sold them to inmates.</p>
<p>Cohen indicated in this ruling that an appeal of his decision was possible.</p>
<p>Edward Moss, a Miami attorney representing the tobacco companies, told Reuters he had not seen the decision but said the ruling would make defending the tobacco companies more difficult.</p>
<p>"It's like trying to defend yourself in a fight without your hands," Moss said.</p>
