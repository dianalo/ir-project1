<p>Indonesia's human rights commission has urged the nation's powerful armed forces to carefully resolve tensions that sparked recent riots, Antara news agency reported on Sunday.</p>
<p>Riots in several areas of Indonesia have rocked the multi-ethnic country since late last year and the military has been criticised for its handling of the disturbances.</p>
<p>"ABRI (armed forces) must solve the riots wisely and the government must solve the problems honestly, otherwise they will continue to happen," Antara quoted Baharuddin Lopa, secretary-general of the National Commission of Human Rights, as saying on Saturday.</p>
<p>Lopa, speaking to reporters before attending a seminar, said unfair settlement of the riots would only prompt people to oppose the government and its security apparatuses.</p>
<p>Lopa also said the May 29 general elections should be carried out in an honest way to avoid unrest which could disrupt the polls. Antara gave no further details.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, at least three government offices, 11 vehicles and dozens of homes were damaged and 14 people were injured in Wonosobo, Central Java, in clashes between supporters of the Moslem-based United Development Party (PPP) and the ruling Golkar party, newspapers have said.</p>
<p>Five people had been questioned after the riots.</p>
<p>Wonosobo was one of several towns in Central Java hit by violence in the past two weeks, sparked by clashes between PPP and Golkar supporters.</p>
<p>Riots broke out in the coastal town of Pekalongan, a PPP stronghold, two weeks ago after reports that a popular folk singer who has campaigned for the PPP in the past would be a Golkar candidate in the May 29 general elections.</p>
<p>Pekalongan's riot was the first violent disturbance in Java since a mob attacked Chinese homes and businesses, Christian churches and Buddhist temples in Tasikmalaya town in West Java in January.</p>
<p>Four people died in those riots, sparked by police brutality against a Moslem teacher.</p>
<p>At least 200 people died in clashes between local Dayaks and immigrant Madurese in West Kalimantan province on Borneo island which started in December and lasted through February.</p>
<p>Only three political parties -- the PPP, Golkar and the Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) -- are allowed to contest Indonesia's general elections.</p>
