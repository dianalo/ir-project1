<p>PROTEST AFTERMATH CONTINUES</p>
<p>A Sydney union organiser has resigned and a ninth person has been arrested in the continuing aftermath of last month's pre-budget invasion of Parliament House.</p>
<p>Viduar Vega of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union was pictured in a Sydney newspaper last Saturday as part of the group which forced open the doors of Parliament House during the August 19 rally.</p>
<p>Mr Vega has not been charged by Australian Federal Police but the CFMEU says it respects his decision to resign.</p>
<p>A 59 year old Nowra man has today been charged with two counts of assaulting police during a protest outside the old Parliament House on August 20.</p>

<p>ACTU TO BUILD UNITED FRONT</p>
<p>The ACTU is out to build a united front in the community against aspects of the Workplace Relations Bill and the budget.</p>
<p>The goal was set at a three day ACTU Council meeting which has finished in the Victorian town of Lorne.</p>
<p>ACTU Assistant Secretary, Bill Mansfield, says the job ahead is to unite the union movement, employers, community groups and parliamentarians to defeat parts of the industrial relations reforms and budget.</p>
<p>Mr Mansfield warns unemployment could nudge 9 percent by the end of the year with growth slowing and cuts to labour market programs.</p>
<p>He also says the meeting laid to rest controversey over the pre-budget riot in Canberra and speculation about the ACTU leadership.</p>

<p>RECONCILIATION CONVENTION NEXT YEAR</p>
<p>The Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation will sponsor a convention next year on how best to advance social justice, land and citizenship issues.</p>
<p>The convention will discuss whether reconciliation between indigenous and white Australians should be dealt with through a national document, such as the Constitution, or a series of regional agreements.</p>
<p>More than a thousand people from Government, industry and community groups will be invited to the Melbourne conference, which will report back to Federal Parliament.</p>

<p>NSW BACKS DOWN ON HOSPITAL CUTS</p>
<p>Funding for inner-Sydney hospitals won't now be cut to help pay for hospitals in the city's south-west and other New South Wales growth regions.</p>
<p>The Health Minister, Andrew Refshauge, says the Council on the Coast of Government has found the A$34 million for this, so it won't need to come from inner-city hospitals.</p>
<p>The cuts were seen as politically damaging for the Carr Government.</p>
<p>As about a thousand people protested against cuts to the Prince of Wales Hospital, its clinical director described the backdown as a a victory for common sense.</p>
<p>But the chairman of the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, Alex Sanchez says it's a despicable sell-out of the people of western Sydney.</p>

<p>ROAD TRAINS KNOCKED BACK IN SOUTH-EAST QUEENSLAND</p>
<p>Road trains up to 33 metres in length and towing three trailers behind them won't be trialled on south-east Queensland roads after a backdown by the Main Roads Department.</p>
<p>The B-triples have prompted safety concerns from councils, police and the community.</p>
<p>The department will recommend that the trucks be confined to existing road train routes west of Toowoomba.</p>
<p>----</p>
<p>DEMOCRATS TO FORCE DEBATES ON DENTAL SCHEME</p>
<p>The Democrats have decided to force debates in both houses of Parliament on the Federal Government's decision to axe the Commonwealth Dental Programme.</p>
<p>The Government argues the programme, which will cost A$400 million over four years, is a state matter but there are no moves afoot to ensure the states continue the programme.</p>
<p>Democrats' health spokeswoman, Meg Lees, says debate will force Coalition MPs to defend the decision to scrap the scheme, which may cause a change of heart.</p>
<p>Senator Lees says the scheme's abolition will be a return to the days of people waiting in pain, and probably ending up getting teeth pulled rather than filled.</p>
