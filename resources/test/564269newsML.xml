<p>Eurotunnel SA /Plc said on Tuesday that it was dissatisfied with an expert panel decision concerning its dispute with builders TML and said it could call for further arbitration, a spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>"This decision is not satisfying because it recognises that the demands by Eurotunnel have grounds in principle but at the same time it refuses to recognise the majority of our demands," the spokeswoman said about a expert panel decision published earlier on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel is claiming eight billion francs ($1.4 billion) for the late delivery of rolling stock by TML while construction costs ended up twice the original amount at 10 billion francs. ($ = 5.831 French Francs)</p>
