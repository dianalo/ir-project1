<p>Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene said on Tuesday European Union (EU) reforms must be flexible enough to allow some member states to pursue European integration at a faster pace than others.</p>
<p>But he warned that they should not lead to an "a la carte" arrangement in which member states could pick and choose only those elements of EU membership which suited them.</p>
<p>In a speech to an audience of Dutch businessmen, Dehaene said it had to be recognised that not all EU countries were equally enthusiastic about further European integration.</p>
<p>"We have to make it possible for those who want to go faster to be able to go faster," he told reporters before his speech.</p>
<p>Dehaene said plans for a treaty embodying reforms to the EU must strike a balance between flexibility and fragmentation.</p>
<p>"Each member state must, at least in principle, adhere to the common goals. We cannot accept the idea of a Europe "a la carte' in which each member state could freely choose which options it wants to take part in," he said.</p>
<p>The European Union has been holding an "intergovernmental conference" to discuss reforms which are expected to be laid out in a new treaty later this year.</p>
