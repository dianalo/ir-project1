<p>The risk of mid-air collisions between airliners such as that over India should gradually be reduced as new air traffic control technology is introduced, aviation experts said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tests are already being carried out on satellite navigation systems which should ensure that in future, unlike now, air traffic controllers will always know exactly what the airliners under their command are doing.</p>
<p>"The world will become a safer place, there's no question about that, but it will take time," said Kieran Daly of Flight International magazine.</p>
<p>Around 350 people were killed on Tuesday when a Saudi Arabia Airlines Boeing 747 collided with a Kazakh Ilyushin Il-76 freighter some 80 km (50 miles) west of New Delhi.</p>
<p>The present air traffic control system means aircraft are at risk of colliding in regions where radar is primitive or where the air is especially crowded.</p>
<p>Airliners in Europe travel along strictly defined air corridors where capacity is limited. Jets move from one radio beacon to the next, asking a series of air controllers for permission to pass through their region.</p>
<p>The margin for error is so narrow that any misunderstanding between pilot and controller can have serious consequences.</p>
<p>Airliners flying across the Atlantic spend much of their journeys off the radar screens altogether and avoid collisions by sticking to huge open corridors of airspace, which severely limits capacity at a time when demand is booming.</p>
<p>But this should all change with the introduction of the so-called Future Air Navigations System, whereby aircraft will carry navigational aids allowing them to be tracked by satellite during their entire time aloft.</p>
<p>The new system will allow controllers to open up more sorely-needed airspace. The use of satellite technology, known as GPS, is being tested by airlines operating in the Pacific.</p>
<p>"We are moving away from the current system where aircraft move from beacon to beacon. It's pretty stupid because everyone moves in the same airway," said David Rider, editor of Janes's Air Traffic Control.</p>
<p>"With GPS controllers have a means of knowing where aircraft are. There's no reason at all why they can't start telling pilots to choose their own routes."</p>
<p>When the satellite communications system is up and running it will spell the end of the crackling VHF radios which are currently the only way pilots can talk to controllers.</p>
<p>"With satellite communications you do get a very unambiguous message. Some very serious problems have been caused by people not understanding someone else's accent," said Daly.</p>
<p>The main drawback to the new system is that the equipment is not mandatory and cash-strapped airlines might choose not to buy it. But Daly said carriers might soon have no choice.</p>
<p>"Countries will say they are not prepared to keep the radio beacons working and will turn them off, saying in effect that if a plane wants to use that airspace, it will have to have GPS. That's why everyone will have to go to GPS eventually," he said.</p>
<p>Rider added: "My feeling is there will be more aircraft in the skies and the probability of collisions will not increase."</p>
<p>Many modern airliners are equipped with TCAS collision avoidance systems which warn pilots that another plane is dangerously close.</p>
<p>These only work if both aircraft are carrying the expensive equipment but are credited with averting at least one disaster.</p>
<p>"There is very good evidence that TCAS has been responsible for avoiding horrific collisions. One of those was a Cathay Pacific 747 and British Airways 747 over the far east of Russia. In the industry this is accepted as being TCAS save," Daly said.</p>
