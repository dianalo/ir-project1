<p>Belgian Finance Minister Philippe Maystadt said on Tuesday that he expected Belgium to reduce its budget deficit to 1.6 percent of gross domestic product in 2000.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, he said he had not yet made a forecast for the debt/GDP ratio.</p>
<p>The forecasts will be contained in a medium-term plan designed to show Belgium's commitment to maintaining fiscal discipline both before and after the launch of a single European currency in 1999.</p>
<p>The Belgian government on Tuesday presented a budget for 1997 which aims to cut the public deficit to 2.9 percent of GDP from 3.3 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>The budget will reduce its debt to GDP ratio -- the highest in Europe -- to 127.0 percent in 1997 from 130.4 percent in 1996.</p>
<p>Maystadt reiterated that Belgium planned to reduce its debt by stabilising its primary surplus -- which excludes debt service payments -- at this year's level of 5.5 percent, which he said was one of the highest primary surpluses in Europe.</p>
<p>Though this argument might be questioned by fiscal purists in Germany, which is seen more likely to prefer an actual rather than primary surplus, the stabilising of the primary surplus should provide revenues to pay down the debt.</p>
<p>"This automatically generates a decline in the debt to GDP ratio," Maystadt said.</p>
<p>He added that the International Monetary Fund supported the plan in its discussions with Belgium.</p>
<p>"The IMF in its last consultations on Belgium, indicated this stabilisation of the primary surplus is the most appropriate now for Belgium," he said.</p>
