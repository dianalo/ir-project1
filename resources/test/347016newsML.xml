<p>Fidelity Investments will launch three index funds in the second quarter and cut fees on some of its bond funds, said Paul Hondros, head of Fidelity's retail group.</p>
<p>"As you know, index funds have performed very well versus active management (funds), and active management has struggled to keep pace," Hondros told an audience of about 2,000 fund investors on the last leg of Fidelity's six city tour over the last two weeks.</p>
<p>"You have asked us to provide more index funds, and we intend to respond," he said.</p>
<p>Fidelity will double the number of equity index funds it offers by introducing three broad-based index funds which track the Wilshire 4500 and the Wilshire 5000 and Morgan Stanley's EAFE (Europe, Australia, Far East) index, he said.</p>
<p>Hondros said the most asked question as Fidelity executives went on a six-city tour to meet institutional and retail fund holders was how Fidelity's managed equity funds stacked up against index funds.</p>
<p>"So much has been written about index funds...and can active management beat the index," he told reporters following a conference in Boston, attended by about 2,000 people.</p>
<p>He said Fidelity will cut fees on some of its bond funds to compete with Vanguard Group.</p>
