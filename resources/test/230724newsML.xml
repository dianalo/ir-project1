<p>Aslan Maskhadov, chief commander of Chechnya's independence fighters who have humiliated the Russian army, said on Tuesday he planned to run in the presidential election expected early next year.</p>
<p>"I have decided I will be a candidate," Maskhadov, who now heads the Chechen government effectively recognised by Moscow, told reporters outside his office in central Grozny.</p>
<p>Maskhadov's announcement ends weeks of speculation about whether or not he planned to seek office.</p>
<p>Current leader Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev and guerrilla chief Shamil Basayev have already thrown their hats into the ring, but observers see Maskhadov as a strong early favorite.</p>
<p>Moscow's troops, which had failed to crush rebel resistance in 21 months of war, are in the final stages of a pullout from the mountainous Caucasus region.</p>
<p>Russian human rights campaigner Sergei Kovalyov told separatist leaders last week the vote risked being turned into a farce unless it was postponed to give time to establish valid voting rules and find ways for an estimated 400,000 refugees -- nearly half the population -- who fled the war, to cast ballots.</p>
<p>But Maskhadov gave no indication the January 27 poll, which will also choose a local parliament, would be delayed.</p>
<p>"We need to quickly hold elections and the government that is chosen by the people should get down to work," Maskhadov, clad in a traditional Chechen lambswool hat and flanked by armed bodyguards, told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said any delay in the vote would open the door to "provocations".</p>
<p>By late evening Maskhadov had already opened a campaign headquarters in a run-down four-storey building near Grozny's Minutka traffic circle, scene of some of the bloodiest battles of the war with Russia where most of the surrounding multi- storey apartment blocks are destroyed or burnt out.</p>
<p>Maskhadov said that an attempt to  agree on a single separatist candidate in a show of unity was dead.</p>
<p>"We had the intention of putting forward a united candidate, but to our great regret that did not work out."</p>
<p>The deceptively soft-spoken former Soviet army colonel proved himself a master military tactician in leading his fighters, armed with little more than grenade launchers, automatic rifles and jerry-rigged weapons through successful battles with the overwhelming might of the Russian army.</p>
<p>Yet he has shown more than just an aptitude for making war.</p>
<p>Maskhadov is seen as a more pragmatic figure than the explosive Dzhokhar Dudayev, former Soviet airforce general who had spearheaded Chechnya's independence drive and who had been reported killed in a Russian rocket attack earlier this year.</p>
<p>Maskhadov led peace negotiations with Moscow that culminated in the signing of an agreement on August 31 that formally keeps Chechnya in Russia for the next five years while pulling the troops out.</p>
<p>Many Moscow leaders see Maskhadov as a man with whom they can do business better than with any other Chechen leader.</p>
<p>But Maskhadov, at least in words, sticks firm to Chechnya's claim to independence. "We all have one position - that of our first president Dzhokhar Dudayev.  Chechnya is an independent state."</p>
