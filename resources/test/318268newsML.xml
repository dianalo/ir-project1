<headline>Zaire prime minister orders anti-rebel offensive.</headline>

<p>Zaire's prime minister told the nation on Monday he had formally ordered the armed forces to launch a counter-offensive to recapture territory held by Tutsi-led rebels in the east.</p>
<p>"In the name of the government and in agreement with the president of the republic, I have today ordered our armed forces to conduct the war and recover regions currently under occupation and restore the authority of the state," Kengo wa Dondo said on state television.  </p>
<p>Kengo, whose comments were broadcast before the main evening news, urged the Zairean people to support the armed forces and asked that television and radio programmes reflect this national commitment.</p>
<p>"The sacred duty of every Zairean man and woman is to defend and maintain the nation's territorial integrity," he said.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear what impact Kengo's comments would have on the timing of the counter-thrust, which has been promised for more than a month. Zairean troops and mercenaries have been gathering in the eastern town of Kisangani.</p>
<p>The rebels, who launched their offensive last October, hold towns and territory in the east along the borders with Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda after routing the Zairean army there.</p>
