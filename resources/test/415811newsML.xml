<p>Two former treasurers of France's Socialist Party went on trial in the central city of Lyon on Monday over an allegedly covert party funding network dating back to the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Henri Emmanuelli, who served as Socialist Party chief after being its treasurer from 1988 to 1991, and Andre Laignel are among 50 defendants in a trial expected to last about a month. The others include numerous elected local Socialist officials and business executives.</p>
<p>Emmanuelli and Laignel are accused of receiving illicit campaign contributions from a front company known as Urba which allegedly demanded consulting fees from businesses in return for public works contracts.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say the party illegally raked off 9.4 million francs ($1.65 million) from public works contracts awarded in the Mediterranean port city of Marseille during 1988 and 1989.</p>
<p>The party reiterated its support for Emmanuelli and Laignel, saying that conservative politicians benefited from a "double standard" in political funding scandals that have hit all of France's mainstream parties.</p>
<p>"They are in no way individually responsible for what happened," party spokesman Francois Hollande told reporters.</p>
<p>Emmanuelli has already been given a one-year suspended jail sentence and a 30,000 franc ($6,000) fine on similar charges in a separate trial in 1995.</p>
<p>During that trial in May 1995, investigators discovered that the party took rake-offs from public work contracts via Urba in Brittany.</p>
<p>Both men deny involvement in Urba and say they were unaware of illegal activities. But Urba's ex-chairman Gerard Monate has told investigators he worked with both men on contract awards and that all were aware of the improper dealings.</p>
