<p>Planning Minister Antonio Kandir said Brazil risks slower growth, rising social tension and failure of its economic program if Congress does not approve presidential re-election and key reforms, local newspapers reported.</p>
<p>O Globo newspaper quoted Kandir in Washington as saying that Brazil's economy could grow between seven and nine percent a year if Congress passes a constitutional amendment allowing President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to run for re-election.</p>
<p>Without it, the country's gross domestic product would grow at four to five percent a year, he was quoted as saying. Growth estimates for this year range between 2.4 percent and 3.1 percent, according to a Reuters survey  BRAAN.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Gazeta Mercantil financial daily quoted Kandir as saying badly needed constitutional reforms would come more quickly if lawmakers were to approve a re-election amendment.</p>
<p>But Brazil would see slower growth, risking "strong social tension" and threatening its Real stabilization plan, if Congress did not approve either re-election or reforms, he said.</p>
<p>"I think with each passing day that there is less chance there will not be a re-election," he added.</p>
<p>Gazeta also quoted Kandir as saying that Brazil will only have won the battle against inflation once it is held at an annual rate of two to three percent for three years.</p>
<p>Kandir and other Brazilian top brass are in Washington for a joint meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.</p>
