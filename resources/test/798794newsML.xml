<p>The Serbian government on Thursday met in the capital of its most troubled province Kosovo in a landmark session ahead of September presidential and parliamentary elections in the republic.</p>
<p>Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one but are effectively deprived of any political voice, is widely regarded as a powder keg which, if ignited, could wreck international peace efforts in the Balkans.</p>
<p>The government discussed the republic's regional development strategy with a special emphasis on the Kosovo region, Belgrade media said.</p>
<p>The government will also discuss tasks of a new Regional Development Office to be based in Pristina, the Kosovo capital.</p>
<p>Local analysts expected the government to promise loans to a number of Kosovo's companies. There have also been proposals to revive the province's banking system.</p>
<p>The session in Pristina, chaired by Prime Minister Mirko Marjanovic and held behind closed doors, is the first Serbian government session in the province for at least a decade.</p>
<p>Slobodan Milosevic, the then president of Serbia, also made a rare trip to Kosovo in June and dashed ethnic Albanian hopes that Serbia might grant independence to the province.</p>
<p>Some analysts saw the ministerial trip to Pristina as an attempt by the ruling Socialists to secure votes in Kosovo in the September 21 presidential and parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>Under the new electoral law, Kosovo provides 42 seats for the 250-seat Serbian parliament and the ruling Socialists are heavily counting on those since ethnic Albanians have vowed to boycott the elections.</p>
<p>Pristina's Albanian language media did not expect Serbian ministers to meet ethnic Albanian politicians and party leaders in Kosovo.</p>
<p>The United States has made an improvement in Serbia's treatment of Kosovo one of its conditions for lifting remaining sanctions in force against federal Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and the tiny republic of Montenegro.</p>
<p>Serbia revoked Kosovo's autonomy in 1989, claiming its Albanian population wanted to secede and join neighbouring Albania.</p>
<p>The Albanians have boycotted Serbian institutions since, and their leaders have openly called for secession, forcing the U.S. to warn them this was not an option and to find a solution within Serbia.</p>
<p>All Serb-Albanian talks over the past few months to find a solution to the impasse have been deadlocked.</p>
<p>In the meantime the province has been rocked over the past year by a wave of violence in which more than 30 people have been killed, despite a heavy Serbian police and army presence.</p>
<p>Clandestine Albanian organisations have been blamed for the attacks and scores of ethnic Albanians have been sentenced to stiff prison sentences.</p>
<p>The ruling Serbian Socialists' election campaign promises include reforms and economic development of the country, now emerging from under U.N. sanctions for its involvement in the war in Bosnia.</p>
