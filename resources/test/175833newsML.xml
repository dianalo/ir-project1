<p>Bosnia's three-man presidency failed to agree on Friday how to organise a government.</p>
<p>"The Presidency reached an agreement on general competencies of the Council of Ministers, but no agreement was reached on the organisation of the Council of Ministers," a joint statement said.</p>
<p>According to the Dayton agreement which ended Bosnia's war, the country should be run by a cabinet that includes a prime minister, foreign and foreign trade ministers, and "other ministers according to need".</p>
<p>The joint statement said the Presidency chairman and Moslem leader Alija Izetbegovic and the Croat representative Kresimir Zubak argued that the council should include a chairman and five ministers.</p>
<p>Serb represntative Momcilo Krajisnik insisted a Prime Minister and two ministers should be appointed, who would then report on expanding the ministry.</p>
<p>Despite arguing about the ministry, the trio accepted an agenda for a conference in Paris on implementing the Dayton accords.</p>
<p>Diplomats say they hope the three men will agree on the council of ministers before the conference meets next Thursday.</p>
<p>The Sarajevo-based newsagency Oslobodjenje quoted the office of the international High Representative as saying while November 14 was not a formal deadline for resolving the issue, it would be "in Bosnia's interests to complete the job before the Paris conference."</p>
<p>The meeting was the sixth time the three ethnic leaders have met since they were elected to the presidency in September.</p>
