<p>French police defused a bomb hidden in a plastic bag and planted in a busy central post office in the Mediterranean port of Marseille on Saturday.</p>
<p>Police said the unidentified attackers "clearly wanted to kill" by targeting a post office during the Christmas period when people are queueing up to mail gifts and cards.</p>
<p>Staff spotted the three-kg (6.6 lb) dynamite bomb shortly before the post office, on the Boulevard de Strasbourg, opened in the morning.</p>
<p>Police said the detonator had failed to work and they were checking at what time the device had been timed to go off.</p>
<p>"We can't say if the bomb was planted last night, overnight or this morning," an investigator said.</p>
<p>"What is certain is that this is a very powerful device that would have caused major damage in the area," he added.</p>
<p>Police declined to speculate on who the attackers were, but police sources said there were some similarities with recent bomb attacks on the French mainland claimed by Corsican separatists.</p>
<p>The mayor of Marseille, Territorial Administration Minister Jean-Claude Gaudin visited the post office. Police cordoned off the area and stepped up patrols.</p>
<p>French security forces are on alert for possible attacks by Algerian Moslem extremists and Corsican separatists.</p>
<p>Troops are helping police patrol train stations and airports under the so-called Vigipirate plan after a bomb attack blamed on Algerian rebels killed four people on a Paris commuter train earlier this month.</p>
<p>Suspected Corsican separatists set off a bomb overnight outside the apartment of Jean Comiti, the head of the lawyers association in the Corsican town of Ajaccio, and machinegunned a gendarmerie barracks on the French Mediterranean island.</p>
<p>There were no injuries.</p>
<p>The Corsican attacks bore the hallmarks of the outlawed Corsican National Liberation Front (FLNC)-Historic Wing, which has claimed responsibility for nine bombings or machinegunnings on the holiday island in the past week.</p>
<p>The FLNC, which has also carried out bombings on the French mainland recently, has threatened to step up its campaign following the arrest of Corsica's best-known separatist leader who was remanded in custody in Paris on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Francois Santoni, head of Cuncolta Naziunalista, the FLNC's legal wing, and his lawyer girlfriend Marie-Helene Mattei were placed under investigation for attempted extortion and bomb attacks.</p>
