<p>The losing bidder on an electronic toll collection contract in New Jersey filed suit against the award, and is funding a separate lawsuit by a private citizen as well, the Star Ledger reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>Lockheed Martin IMS has decided to seek permission to appeal directly to the state Supreme Court the $500 million contract award, given to competitor MFS Transtech. In addition, the firm is financing a lawsuit filed by a private taxpayer, Walter Nachtigall.</p>
<p>As a private citizen, Nachtigall can challenge portions of the award to MFS on grounds unavailable to Lockheed, the newspaper said. They include whether the New Jersey Turnpike Authority, which is the lead agency on building the electronic toll collection system, has the legal authority to oversee the deal.</p>
<p>Lockheed's challenge centers on whether the bidding process was handled properly.</p>
