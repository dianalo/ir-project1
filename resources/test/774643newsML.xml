<p>Kuwait on Sunday marked the August 2 anniversary of Iraq's occupation by saying Iraq should not be allowed to "manoeuvre out of" U.N. resolutions applied after the 1990 invasion.</p>
<p>Kuwait hailed ..."friendly countries' efforts to thwart Iraq's attempts to manoeuvre out of Security Council resolutions," the Kuwait cabinet said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Iraq's implementation of these resolutions ... would open the way for Iraq to lift the embargo imposed against it, and to return to the civilised world community."</p>
<p>Since the invasion Baghdad has been under U.N. sanctions barring Iraqi oil exports. But in December the world body allowed Iraq to sell $2 billion worth of oil over six months on a renewable basis to buy food and medicine.</p>
<p>Iraq seized Kuwait for seven months before a U.S.-led coalition ejected Iraqi troops from Kuwait in February 1991 after a six-week offensive.</p>
<p>Before the sanctions can be fully lifted Iraq has to convince the United Nations that it has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction and account for about 600 Kuwaitis missing since the occupation.</p>
