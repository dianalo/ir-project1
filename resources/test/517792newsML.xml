<p>Home mortgage rates were little changed this week as signs that inflation remains under control kept interest rates steady, Freddie Mac said Thursday.</p>
<p>Thirty-year fixed rate mortgage rates edged up to 8.16 percent in the week ended April 18 from 8.15 percent last week, while 15-year mortgages inched upward to 7.71 percent from 7.67 percent.</p>
<p>One-year adjustable mortgages dipped to an average 5.89 percent from 5.91 percent, it said.</p>
<p>A year ago, the 30-year rate averaged 7.95 percent, the 15-year 7.48 percent and the adjustable loan 5.75 percent.</p>
<p>"There was renewed evidence this week that inflation is in check, so we may even see a slight drop in rates next week," Frank Nothaft, Freddie Mac's chief economist, said.</p>
<p>"Housing starts remain at relatively high levels, and the spring homebuying season promises to be strong," Nothaft added. "Homebuyers can expect favourable rates for the foreseeable future."</p>
<p>On Wednesday the Commerce Department said U.S. March housing starts fell 6.4 percent to an annualized rate of 1.425 million units, while the Labour Department Tuesday said consumer prices rose by only 0.1 percent last month.</p>
<p>Lenders charged an average of 1.7 percent in fees and points on both 30- and 15-year loans, down from 1.8 percent last week. They charged 1.4 percent on adjustable loans, down from 1.5 percent last week.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac is a corporation chartered by Congress that buys mortgages from lenders and packages them into securities for investors.</p>
