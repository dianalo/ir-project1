<p>Strong second-half domestic demand may push Poland's growth above this year's 5.5 percent target but the recent consumer spending frenzy raised concern over possible overheating.</p>
<p>The National Bank of Poland's (NBP) key concern, echoed by several economists, is that spending is increasingly financed by credit, notably consumer loans, boosting demand beyond levels which the economy is able to absorb safely.</p>
<p>NBP president Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz told a news conference on Monday the overall 40 percent growth in credit this year, with consumer loans seen doubling, created an inflationary impulse which might be felt only in mid-1997.</p>
<p>"Now the real growth of credit for companies is already twice as big as the (GDP) growth rate," she said.</p>
<p>The bank is also concerned that booming demand threatened to stretch Poland's official trade deficit, seen reaching $8 billion this year, to levels which would no longer be offset by foreign direct investment and cross-border trade.</p>
<p>Some economists argue that the threat of overheating is overdone, as much domestic spending goes towards investment needed to make the economy competitive.</p>
<p>The NBP has been ringing alarm bells since October, saying a monetary tightening was necessary and announcing it would keep its official rates flat to allow real interest rates to rise.</p>
<p>But this month the bank took its warnings a step further, saying a rate rise might be necessary to pour cold water on Poles' newly found enthusiasm for spending on credit.</p>
<p>Some economists echoed the central bank's concern that booming domestic demand, estimated to grow by a real 10 percent this year, could no longer be sustained without either a rise in inflation or a widening of the trade deficit.</p>
<p>A joint study by the Central Statistics Office (GUS) and the Polish Academy of Sciences (PAN) said last week that domestic demand would require significant cooling down to prevent the economy from overheating.</p>
<p>But Finance Minister Grzegorz Kolodko said the spending boom and a rise in credit should be treated as a vote of confidence in the prospects of the Polish economy.</p>
<p>The ministry also argued that to control consumer spending the central bank should introduce temporary caps on consumer credit rather than raise rates, which would affect investment.</p>
<p>Also some analysts say the threat of overheating was overdone, given a very low starting point for credit and the immense investment needs of the country's transforming economy.</p>
<p>Those economists say that when Poland swung from export-driven growth in 1995 to expansion fuelled by domestic demand, a leading force was investment which was needed to modernise the economy and make it truly competitive.</p>
<p>"If you look just at credit growth it may look alarming but we started from a very low base and in relation to revenues they are still much lower than in developed countries," said Tadeusz Chroscicki, chief analyst at the planning ministry.</p>
<p>He also said that some estimates of domestic demand growth have been too high because they did not take into account Poland's $6 billion surplus in cross-border trade.</p>
<p>"Much of what is shown in statistics as domestic sales is, in fact, unregistered exports," he said.</p>
<p>He said he shared other analysts' concern about the widening trade gap, which could expand again next year after a roughly balanced current account and modest currency reserves growth expected this year on strong foreign direct investment.</p>
<p>But Chroscicki said major retooling by Polish industry and an improving economic climate in Germany, Poland's top trading partner, should bring improvement no later than in 1998.</p>
<p>He also said expected stabilisation of the zloty next year should create more favourable conditions for exporters.</p>
