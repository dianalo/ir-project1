<p>Marxist rebels holding 72 hostages in Lima and the Peruvian government both showed they were eager for a bloodless solution to the siege in a seventh negotiating round Thursday, the talks' guarantors said.</p>
<p>"The guarantors have noted and appreciated the desire of the participants to achieve a solution," said Canadian ambassador Anthony Vincent, one of three guarantors, who read out a statement after the three hour meeting in a safehouse.</p>
<p>"During this meeting substantial issues continued to be addressed and for its part the commision of guarantors has listened to the discussions and put forward certain suggestions," he said.</p>
<p>He also said "humanitarian factors received attention," for the first time since talks began on Feb. 11.</p>
<p>Vincent, who was bound to secrecy on exactly what was discussed, said that the next negotiating round will be held Monday. The other guarantors overseeing the talks to end the 72-day siege are the Red Cross and the Vatican.</p>
<p>The main demand of the roughly 15 guerrillas who grabbed their hostages storming the Japanese ambassador's residence Dec. 17 is the release of 400 jailed comrades from their Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA).</p>
<p>As a Red Cross car drove MRTA chief Nestor Cerpa to the talks' safehouse across the street from the fortified compound, his fellow rebels broadcast their revolutionary hymn commemmorating dead comrades and yelled defiant slogans.</p>
<p>"What is our mission? Freedom for the prisoners! On the 72nd day of the hostage-taking, nobody surrenders, damn it!" they shouted.</p>
<p>The MRTA's international spokesman said earlier on Thursday that reports the guerrillas would settle instead for ransom payments, improved prison conditions and asylum in a foreign country for themselves were "lies" spread by the government.</p>
<p>Such versions "only seek to confuse the objectives (of the takeover) and obstruct a political solution," MRTA spokesman Isaac Velazco said in a statement sent to Reuters by e-mail from Hamburg, Germany.</p>
<p>President Alberto Fujimori repeatedly ruled out considering the release of MRTA prisoners.</p>
<p>But the recent renewal of face-to-face talks between the two sides after weeks of mutual intransigence prompted speculation the MRTA might have privately expressed a willingness to negotiate its principal demand.</p>
<p>One MRTA leader told Reuters in an interview in the group's jungle stronghold that they might be prepared to accept the release of a smaller number of prisoners, depending on their experience or importance in the movement.</p>
<p>The MRTA leader said in the jungle interview that time was on the rebels' side and they were prepared to wait as long as necessary for a "dignified solution to the siege."</p>
<p>"We are in no hurry," the rebel, who identified himself as Comrade Alejandro, a member of the MRTA's high command, said at a secret training camp. "What do we lose if we wait months, when we have waited centuries for a revolution?"</p>
