<p>Brazilian private bank Banco Itau is still interested in acquiring control of Rio de Janeiro state bank Banco Banerj, said Itau president Roberto Setubal.</p>
<p>However, Setubal underscored that the bank needs guarantees that debts to Banerj's employees and pension fund will not be assumed by the new controlling shareholders.</p>
<p>"We are still interested, but we need guarantees that there will be no risk that the buyer will have to assume those debts," he said.  </p>
<p>He also said the 480 million real minimum price for Banerj should be revised, as it is considered too high.</p>
<p>Setubal emphasized that Banco Itau, Brazil's second largest private bank, does not need to acquire a bank or open new branches to continue growing and increasing its client base. He said the bank's client portfolio rose 10 percent last year with the same network of about 1,000 branches.</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro state attempted to sell Banerj twice last year, but the auctions were suspended because of court orders against the bank's privatization.  </p>
<p>Currently, the state is revising the privatization rules governing the Banerj sale before it publishes new tender documents.</p>
<p>Banerj must be privatized by June to avoid the bank's liquidation. Only the Central Bank, which has been managing Banerj under special administration, could extend that deadline by continuing to run it, giving the state more time to prepare the sell-off.</p>
