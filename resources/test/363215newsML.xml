<p>Singapore's state pension system is at full stretch and unlikely to keep pace with the demands of one of the world's fastest ageing populations, insurance industry sources say.</p>
<p>Singapore faces "a significant societal problem -- a rapidly ageing population, in combination with a government-sponsored retirement scheme which is likely to be incapable of financing the population's retirement needs," a spokesman at consulting actuaries Tillinghast-Towers Perrin told Reuters.</p>
<p>Singapore's retired community is among the fastest growing in world according to Govindaraj Shantakumar, a senior lecturer at the National University of Singapore and the author of a benchmark research document on the country's demography.</p>
<p>According to Shantakumar, Singapore had 7.5 workers supporting every retired person in 1990. By 2030, he predicts the ratio to be 2.2 to one.</p>
<p>The financial burden this brings is exacerbated by the fact that "only 13 percent of the elderly have made financial plans for old age as most feel their children will provide for them," the Ministry of Community Development (MCD) says.</p>
<p>The government began to grapple with the problem in 1993 by enacting legislation to raise the national retirement age from 55 to 60 and left the door open to increase it to 65.</p>
<p>The Maintenance of Parents Act in 1995 allowed parents to sue children through a special tribunal for financial support. Nursing homes can go to the tribunals to sue for unpaid bills.</p>
<p>There are also tax breaks of S$3,500 (US$2,500) per year to encourage people to care for elderly parents at home. Average income is about U.S.$22,000 a year.</p>
<p>And for 1997, new rules were unveiled allowing almost every member of the state retirement scheme to use these savings to invest in private sector financial products to maximise returns.</p>
<p>About S$3.0 billion of these funds are expected to be pumped into the private sector over the next three years as a result.</p>
<p>The new rules could not have been more timely.</p>
<p>In November 1996, MCD published the National Survey of Senior Citizens In Singapore. Almost 56 percent of those over 55 thought their financial plans for retirement were inadequate.</p>
<p>Such fears are well founded as the Central Provident Fund (CPF) pension scheme allows individuals to make withdrawals to buy property or pay for education.</p>
<p>The insurance industry estimates that at age 55, the average CPF member had paid in $77,000, and withdrawn S$25,000.</p>
<p>Insurance models show that to draw a monthly retirement income of S$1,300 over 20 years (S$300 less than the average wage in Singapore), individuals must have a balance of S$160,000, assuming an interest rate of eight percent.</p>
<p>At four percent interest (Singapore's consumer price index rate is about three percent), S$220,000 is the minimum estimate.</p>
<p>"It is clear that CPF funds are unlikely to provide adequate retirement income for many, if not most, Singaporeans," said one insurance analyst who declined to be identified.</p>
<p>But simply throwing open the doors to investment will not provide all the answers. Private pensions are only just taking off. Investment in unit trusts was only allowed in 1993 and restrictions imposed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore remain on what are considered suitable vehicles.</p>
<p>The annuity market, best suited to providing long term regular payments in retirement, is almost non-existent.</p>
<p>Figures from the office of the Insurance Commissioner show just 8,544 annunity policies in force as at December 31 1995, compared to 2.4 million other life insurance products.</p>
<p>Annunities face the dual difficulty of tough investment restrictions and high guaranteed returns to policyholders.</p>
<p>Law Song Keng, president of Singapore's Life Insurance Association (LIA), told Reuters in a statement the association had commissioned research into the pensions problem.</p>
