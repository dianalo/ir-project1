<p>Britain should keep its options open on a single European currency but should not try to prevent other countries from going ahead, Confederation of British Industry director-general Adair Turner said.</p>
<p>In a speech prepared for delivery to the Lombard Association on Tuesday night, he said other EU countries looked like they were going ahead with monetary union and Britain needed to plan accordingly.</p>
<p>"Should we try to stop the others from going ahead? The answer is an unequivocal no," Turner said.  </p>
<p>"It's no because there may well be a strong case for an inner core going ahead with EMU -- even if we don't -- and if so we should not stand in the way of that economic logic."</p>
<p>Britain should use its influence to press for improved labour market flexibility in Europe and strict application of the Maastricht convergence criteria, thereby increasing the likelihood that EMU would be a success.</p>
<p>"We have a vital national interest in seeking to ensure that the EMU which does emerge is a successful one," Turner said.</p>
<p>"We should try to ensure that the EMU which is going to emerge is more likely to be one we might want to join. But while one of the aims of keeping the option open should be to maintain our influence, it should not be the sole aim. Keeping the option is also important because the right choice for Britain may be to enter." There were important arguments both for and against British participation in EMU and there needed to be a detailed debate on the issues, Turner added.</p>
