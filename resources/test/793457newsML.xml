<p>The Kenyan shilling opened at a new official record low against the dollar after the World Bank said it had delayed paying part of a loan and would find it hard to hand over the money until Kenya addresses concerns on graft.</p>
<p>The shilling was posted at a commercial mean rate of 70.48 to the dollar against Monday's close of 70, represening a 0.69 percent drop, commercial bank dealers told Reuters.</p>
<p>The previous official low of 70.26 was touched last Thursday after the International Monetary Fund cancelled a key aid package following a row with Kenya over corruption. Before the shilling turmoil last week, the Central Bank of Kenya had listed 69.22 as the official low.</p>
<p>"Judging from the new information from the World Bank, we expect to see further shilling weakening," one dealer said.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected inflows from the coffee sector to cushion the shilling on Tuesday but that would be followed by further depreciation because commercial and foreign investor demand for the dollar remained very heavy.</p>
<p>On Monday, the shilling fell 1.64 percent from 68.87 as nervous foreign investors pulled out of the market, no longer certain about the country's economic stability after the IMF halted its three-year $205 million package on July 31.</p>
<p>A World Bank official in Washington, who asked not to be named, said the bank shared the concerns of the IMF, which cancelled the first year of its loan programme complaining that government was not doing enough to stamp out corruption.</p>
<p>"The second tranche of our structural adjustment loan had been suspended because policy conditions (on privatisation) had not been met, but we would find it difficult to release this money until the IMF programme is back on track," he said.</p>
<p>He said the Kenyan government had received a first tranche of the loan last year, but the second tranche, totalling just over $71 million, had not been paid.</p>
<p>Last week Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi said the government was considering talks with the IMF over a second year arrangement for the aid, under the soft-lending Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility but the IMF said such talks would only take off after the issue of graft was dealt with.</p>
<p>President Daniel arap Moi has said that he will fight graft at all levels of his government and all implicated will be probed but diplomats say the veteran Kenyan leader must stop talking and take some tangible action to be seen to be serious.</p>
<p>Kenya's equity and currency markets have also been hit by investor perception of political instability after spurts of violence in Nairobi and other provincial towns since May 31 when an opposition-backed pro-reform group launched a campaign for constitutional reforms before general elections.</p>
