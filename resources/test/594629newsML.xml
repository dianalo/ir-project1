<p>Inmates stood on the roof of a prison they have taken over in Sao Paulo state and demanded better treatment on Monday.</p>
<p>The prisoners, who are holding five guards hostage, waved banners that said "Stop the torture" and "We want justice.</p>
<p>Another sign said "The visitors are not hostages" in reference to scores of relatives who decided to stay inside the prison after it was taken over on Sunday because they fear troops will storm the facility and beat the inmates.</p>
<p>"Those who stayed behind stayed because they wanted to," said Silvana da Silva, whose husband is among the rioting inmates. "They are afraid shock troops will move in and beat the prisoners."</p>
<p>More than 100 visitors, mainly women and children, walked out on Monday, one day after inmates seized the prison to demand an end to beatings, poor food and overcrowding.</p>
<p>Family members who left the prison said none of the guards had been mistreated.</p>
<p>A prison spokeswoman said authorities were negotiating with inmates to put an end to the rebellion.</p>
<p>Prison riots are a regular occurrence in Brazil, where conditions are poor in notoriously crowded jails.</p>
