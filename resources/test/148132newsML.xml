<p>Harrah's Entertainment Inc said Monday its board had authorized the repurchase of up to 10 percent of its outstanding common stock.</p>
<p>Harrah's has about 102.9 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>The board also approved the company's plan to seek an increase in its available bank facility to $1.1 billion from $750 million, of which about $430 million is currently outstanding.</p>
<p>The modification of the facility is subject to receipt of commitments from banks and certain approvals, Harrah's said.  </p>
<p>"Long term, prospects for growth in earnings and cash flow for our company are excellent. Short term, however, we will have to cope with rapid expansion of new competitive supply in some markets," Harrah's said.</p>
<p>"Over the next six to nine months we will have a clearer picture of the impact of those supply additions as well as our ability to identify additional potential high-return projects," it said.</p>
