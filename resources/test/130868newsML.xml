<p>U.S. spot natgas prices rebounded on Monday as a cold front moved into the central U.S., thereby putting a strain on supplies, industry sources said.</p>
<p>Gulf Coast prices climbed about five cents to the mid-to-high $2.30s, with Henry Hub, La., quoted mostly in the $2.38-2.41 range.</p>
<p>Prices were equally higher in south Texas in the $2.35-$2.37 range despite Texas Utilities' full restoration of its 1,150 megawatt Comanche Peak nuclear unit 2.  </p>
<p>With the thermometer gradually falling, prices in the Midcontinent also gained about four to five cents to the high-$2.20s.</p>
<p>The Chicago city-gate market was quoted in the high-$2.60s to mid-$2.70s, while prices on Northern at Demarcation wavered in the $2.30-2.40 range.</p>
<p>In west Texas, colder temperatures in Northwest caused Permian prices to jump into the mid-$2.20s, up more than five cents from Friday's levels.</p>
<p>As Canadian exports into the U.S. dwindled because of the cold weather now in western Canada, prices at the southern California border surged into the $2.30s, up more than 10 cents from Friday.</p>
<p>Forecasters said temperatures in the Midwest will be as much as 15 degrees below normal on Tuesday. However, temperatures are expected to moderate by the latter part of the week.</p>
