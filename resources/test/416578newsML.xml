<p>The Michelin guide, France's gourmet bible, has given super-chef Alain Ducasse a coveted third star for his new Paris restaurant but simultaneously taken a third star from the restaurant he runs in Monaco.</p>
<p>The 1997 Michelin guide, which appeared on Monday, gave the added star to Ducasse for the Paris restaurant which carries his name and was formerly run by the legendary Joel Robuchon.</p>
<p>It withdrew a star from his glitzy Louis XV in Monaco, whose kitchen the 40-year-old Ducasse has run since its opening in 1987.</p>
<p>The total number of three-star restaurants in France remained at 18 with the promotion and demotion of the Ducasse-run restaurants. Five of the establishments are in Paris.</p>
<p>The Michelin is to France's great chefs what the Oscars are to the Hollywood film industry.</p>
<p>Michelin rival Gault-Millau, whose bright yellow 1997 guide came out in November, gave its highest rating of four "toques" -- the traditional towering white chef's cap -- to just 12 restaurants this year.</p>
