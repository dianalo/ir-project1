<p>India's ruling United Front coalition said on Thursday it had adjourned talks with the Congress party to settle a political crisis, and the two formations would discuss proposals with their party leaders.</p>
<p>"We have to go back and discuss the proposals with the respective parties. Many proposals are there," Harkishen Singh Surjeet, a United Front negotiator, told reporters after the two sides held 90 minutes of talks.  </p>
<p>It was not clear whether the two political formations, which launched make-or-break talks on Wednesday, would hold another round before a vote of confidence in Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda set in parliament for Friday.</p>
<p>United Front negotiator Chandrababu Naidu, asked what the proposals were, said: "We will discuss it at the (United Front) Steering Committee and take a final decision."</p>
<p>The decision-making Steering Committee was expected to meet later on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Discussions are going on," Congress negotiator Madhavrao Scindia said after the morning talks ended.</p>
