<p>British industrial holding company Bullough Plc, which suffered a 45 percent drop in pre-tax profits last year, said on Wednesday its recovery prospects remained good for the current year.</p>
<p>"The prospects for recovery at Bullough remain good and operating profit for the first four months of this year is ahead of last year in all four divisions," chairman Michael Pickard said in a statement.</p>
<p>Since October the refrigeration, heating and engineering group has been engaged in a major restructuring plan. Having disposed of nine companies last year, it has since sold Multistroke, its loss making trailer twistlocks business.</p>
<p>"We only have one other minor disposal to make to complete the sale of our non core businesses," Pickard told the group's Annual General Meeting.</p>
<p>In January, Bullough reported pre-tax profits of 7.99 million stg for the year to October 31, 1996, down from 14.52 million the previous year.</p>
