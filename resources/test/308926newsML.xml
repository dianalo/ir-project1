<p>The dollar seesawed Wednesday, powering to a 46-month high against the yen and a 30-month high versus the mark before succumbing to profit-taking to close mostly lower.</p>
<p>Propelling the dollar's ascent was a recent string of healthy U.S. economic data and the market's desire to push the dollar above 1.60 marks, a key level not seen since July 1994.</p>
<p>"The psychological level of 1.60 marks was a magnet to the market," said Seth Garrett, chief dealer at Credit Suisse First Boston.  </p>
<p>Also, public concern over the health of Russian president Boris Yeltsin aided the dollar, dealers said.</p>
<p>Chief Kremlin doctor Sergei Mironov said Wednesday that Yeltsin had a "fairly serious illness" and should stay in the hospital until the end of the week because of the risk of complication in his pneumonia.</p>
<p>Traders bought dollars as a currency of refuge. Signs of political turmoil in Russia typically weaken the mark because of the close economic ties between Russia and Germany.</p>
<p>The dollar made its sixth consecutive high in as many trading days at 1.60 marks.  </p>
<p>Its inability to push past that level, along with significant early losses in U.S. stocks and bonds, caused dealers to lock in profits by selling dollars.</p>
<p>"On New Year's Eve, we were at 1.5380 marks and we went up to 1.60 today -- that is six pfennigs up without any retracement," said Hans Boman, chief spot dealer at Swedbank. "But I don't think this retracement will last for long."</p>
<p>The dollar closed lower at 1.5855/65 marks compared to 1.5970/80 at Wednesday's open. After hitting a 31-month high against the Swiss franc at 1.3808, the dollar closed down at 1.3700/10 from 1.3765/75.  </p>
<p>Against the yen, the dollar closed at 116.85/90, below its 117.47 European high and 117.35/40 open.</p>
<p>Dealers said a Japanese newspaper report, which quoted a Bank of Japan official as saying the central bank will maintain its low interest rate policy for the time being, hurt the yen.</p>
<p>The British pound gained against the dollar after the Office for National Statistics reported surprisingly strong December jobs data in the United Kingdom.  </p>
<p>"Sterling moved higher after the better-than-expected employment numbers today," said Christian Laland, a trader at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The monthly monetary meeting between UK Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Bank of England Governor Eddie George was held Wednesday, but any decision regarding a speculated rise in interest rates is unlikely to become known until Thursday, traders said.</p>
<p>Higher U.K. rates would make pound-denominated instruments more attractive to foreign investors.  </p>
<p>Sterling ended higher at $1.6830/40 versus $1.6730/40 at Wednesday's open.</p>
<p>In other trade, the dollar fell to Canadian $1.3413/18 from C$1.3457/62. The Australian dollar inched lower to $0.7760/65 from $0.7763/68.</p>
