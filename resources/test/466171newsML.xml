<p>ASEAN foreign ministers are expected to discuss the timing for admitting Burma, Laos and Cambodia to the group when they meet at a Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) gathering next month, diplomatic sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The ASEAN ministers will be meeting on the fringe of the NAM foreign ministers' session (on April 7-8 in New Delhi), and they are expected to discuss the timing for the group's enlargement, among other things," one source said.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) agreed at an informal summit in Jakarta late last year that Burma, Laos and Cambodia would be admitted simultaneously.</p>
<p>Diplomats from the region said there was no question about all three being admitted, despite Western hostility towards Burmese membership because of the democracy and human rights record of Rangoon's military rulers.</p>
<p>The diplomats said the question of timing basically depended on the state of preparedness of the three applicants.</p>
<p>ASEAN, 30 years old this year, groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.</p>
<p>An ASEAN source said the three newcomers were likely to be admitted this year. The foreign ministers were expected to discuss whether this would be during the mid-year ASEAN foreign ministers' meeting or at the informal summit late in the year.</p>
<p>Malaysia will host the ASEAN meetings this year.</p>
