<p>The Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said on Friday that it had signed an agreement to sell a minimum of 900,000 tonnes of wheat to Japan's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries during 1997.</p>
<p>AWB Managing Director John Lawrenson said in a statement that it was likely Japan would buy about 1.2 million tonnes during the life of the agreement for the 1997 year.  </p>
<p>Of the minimum tonnage to be bought, about 200,000 tonnes of APH (Australian Prime Hard) wheat would be shipped from New South Wales and Queensland and 700,000 tonnes of ASW (Australian Standard White) would be shipped from Western Australia.</p>
<p>"Japan is amoung AWB's top five customers by volume regularly and, most importantly, is a premium customer because of the high quality of wheat and customer service required by Japan," Lawrenson said.</p>
<p>"This result confirms our achievement in developing noodle wheats and recognises Australia's reliability as a consistent year-round shipper in constrast to our competitors," he said.  </p>
<p>Last year the AWB agreed to supply between 900,000 tonnes to 1.1 million tonnes of wheat to Japan during 1996.</p>
