<p>The European Commission said on Wednesday it had started a preliminary probe into French retailer Promodes SA increased stake in Italian hyper and supermarket Gruppo G Srl.</p>
<p>It said the deal was submitted for clearance on November 13 under the European Union's merger rules. The Commission has a month from that date to clear the operation or start a four-month in-depth investigation.</p>
<p>Promodes said in September it had raised its stake in Gruppo G to 80 percent from 34.5 percent. -- Brussels newsroom 322 2876841</p>
