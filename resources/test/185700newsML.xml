<p>IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said on Tuesday it had assigned ratings to Telefonica Europe B.V's $1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Note programme.</p>
<p>"Telefonica Europe B.V.'s short-term unsubordinated debt is rated A1 plus, its long-term unsubordinated debt AA minus and its long-term subordinated debt A plus," IBCA said in a statement.</p>
<p>Telefonica Europe B.V. is a wholly owned subsidiary of Telefonica de Espana SA.  </p>
<p>"The ratings reflect the programme's unconditional and irrevocable guarantee by Telefonica de Espana, one of the largest groups in Spain in terms of total assets and the fifth largest telecommunications operator in Europe," IBCA said in a statement.</p>
<p>"The group has a strong domestic market position in basic telephony as well as important investments overseas in international telecommunications companies. The Spanish government has at present a 21.2 percent stake in Telefonica de Espana," it said.</p>
