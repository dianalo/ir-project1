<p>The two-man crew of a balloon was plucked from the Mediterranean by the French military on Sunday after aborting a round-the-world flight begun just hours before in Switzerland, officials said.</p>
<p>Neither man was hurt, a Defence Ministry spokesman told Reuters.  </p>
<p>"The two men were picked up by a launch and are heading for La Grande Motte (a coastal resort east of Marseille)," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Two helicopters, a patrol aircraft and at least two launches were involved in the rescue, the spokesman said.</p>
<p>The rescue took place shortly after 4 p.m. (1500 GMT).</p>
