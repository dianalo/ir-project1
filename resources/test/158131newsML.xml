<p>Finance minister Jean Arthuis said on Wednesday he had no reason to worry about an awaited European Commission decision on the use of France Telecom funds to show a public deficit of three percent of GDP next year in line with the terms for EU economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>Echoing remarks earlier in the day from government spokesman Alain Lamassoure, Arthuis told a news conference: "No decision has been taken so far by the Commission. I have no reason to worry about the way this has been drawn up in accounting terms."</p>
<p>"We'll meet the targets," he said of the Maastricht Treaty criteria for monetary union.</p>
<p>Looking beyond next year, Arthuis added: "We will have an overall deficit equivalent to 2.8 percent of GDP in 1998."</p>
<p>Lamassoure earlier quoted President Jacques Chirac as saying the Maastricht deadlines would be met and that both France and Germany would do everything necessary to ensure this.</p>
<p>The Commission is expected to announce next week whether it agrees, for the purposes of Maastricht deficit arithmetic, with France's use of 37.5 million francs which will be transferred to the government to pay future retirement pensions for France Telecom staff.</p>
