<p>Hundreds of rebels ransacked the main army base in southern Albania on Saturday while bewildered soldiers stood by, eyewitnesses said.</p>
<p>Jubilant rebels seized thousands of arms including assault rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and launchers, and then left the base firing their new weapons in the air, they said.</p>
<p>Gjirokaster, 30 km (20 miles) from the Greek border, is the main government stronghold in the south and one of the few towns which has not joined the revolt against President Sali Berisha.</p>
<p>Earlier on Saturday, at least six army helicopters arrived in Gjirokaster and disgorged dozens of troops to bolster morale in the beleaguered town, which is cut off by land to the north and the south.</p>
<p>But eyewitnesses said local residents gathered quickly and opened fire as confused soldiers got out of truck near the town square. About 15 soldiers surrendered and the rest ran off, they said.</p>
<p>If Gjirokaster goes over to the rebels, most of the south will be in their hands and Berisha will face a country which is split cleanly in two.</p>
<p>Rebels seized towns throughout the south last week in a popular uprising against Berisha. Locals blame Berisha for the collapse of five popular investment schemes in January, which wiped out the savings of tens of thousands of Albanians.</p>
<p>Albania, Europe's poorest country, has been swept by riots and anti-government protests since the schemes failed. Rebels near the border have begun a widespread popular resistance, taunting Berisha and challenging the army to move.</p>
<p>Anti-government riots swept southern Albania last weekend. Since then rebels have seized tanks and artillery pieces. Entire military bases have gone over to their cause.</p>
