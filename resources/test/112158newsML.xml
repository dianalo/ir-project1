<p>DiverseyLever, a unit of Anglo-Dutch Unilever Plc, will invest some US$160 million over the next five years in the Asia Pacific region, regional director Ray Jones told Reuters on Friday.</p>
<p>DiverseyLever is a new company formed after the merger of Diversey, a Unilever acquisition from the Molson Companies of Canada, and Lever Industrial International, Unilever's industrial and institutional cleaning business group, in April.</p>
<p>With an annual turnover of US$2 billion, the company says it is the world's second largest producer of industrial and institutional cleaning and hygiene products and services.  </p>
<p>"We are spending over the course of the next five years something like US$160 million in upgrading facilities, in investing in new areas and people in Asia Pacific," Jones said in an interview.</p>
<p>"We have budgeted US$10 million for next year in refurbishing of new factories," Jones said, adding that US$10 million was a net sum after deducting proceeds from sales of some factories.</p>
<p>Jones said the company had invested in new premises in India and the Philippines. It was also upgrading plants in Thailand and Japan as well as investing in a new plant in Indonesia.  </p>
<p>He said India, Indonesia and China offered the greatest growth potential for the company in Asia.</p>
<p>It now had manufacturing facilities in 11 countries in Asia Pacific and a hygiene college in the Philippines for customer and staff training.</p>
<p>Jones said the company was still in the process of streamlining the two business operations after the merger. This included merging the factories in Thailand and the Philippines as well as reducing third party manufacturing and increasing in-house production.  </p>
<p>"We have a plan in Asia Pacific to harmonise all our business units by August 1997," Jones said.</p>
<p>Jones said Singapore was chosen as regional headquarters due to its strategic location and its proximity to customers.</p>
