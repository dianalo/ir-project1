<p>British opposition leader Tony Blair, charging that the Conservative government was "a pathetic spectacle" on the verge of collapse, told his Labour party on Thursday to get ready for an early election.</p>
<p>In a pep-talk to Labour candidates in the election, which must be held by May 22, Blair sought to maintain the political momentum Labour has generated this week with a pledge not to raise taxes and a high-profile pitch for the business vote.</p>
<p>"Today, I am putting you on an election war footing," said the Labour leader, whose party enjoys an opinion poll lead of about 20 percentage points.</p>
<p>"The Conservatives are in a state of decay and disintegration. They are in a state of panic. They are in such a state that anything could happen to bring the election forward."</p>
<p>Prime Minister John Major has said he wants to wait until the last moment before calling an election but media reports are now saying a March 20 election is more likely than one in May.</p>
<p>The Conservatives have an equal number of members of parliament (322) as the combined opposition and could face problems winning key legislative votes.</p>
<p>Blair said divisions in the ruling Conservative party were so deep that Major's government was no longer capable of taking difficult decisions.</p>
<p>This was dangerous and damaging for Britain, he said.</p>
<p>"They are the fingertips government, clinging to power yet with no idea how to use that power. So instead of governing, they stumble on, snatching the occasional headline, but with no strategic direction, no sense of purpose, no leadership," he said.</p>
<p>Blair said it was not enough for Labour to wait for power to fall into its lap. It had to win the trust of voters by explaining to voters how the party had cast off the outdated policies that had led it to defeat in four successive elections.</p>
<p>"It is part of your job, as it is part of my job, to kill for good this ridiculous notion, still peddled by some, that because we won't put people's taxes up, we won't make any differences to their lives," Blair told the Labour candidates.</p>
<p>"This is the kind of nonsense that the left of centre in Britain has had hanging round its neck for too long. And it is one of the reasons why we have been out of power for so long," he added.</p>
