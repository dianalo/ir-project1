<p>The executive chairman of French nickel producer Eramet said on Wednesday he was not against a project by another group to build a nickel plant in the north of New Caledonia as long as this did not threaten the development of Eramet in the region.</p>
<p>"We are favourable to the implementation of that project...We may even help if possible...But our own project must not be hurt by that project in the north," Yves Rambaud told Reuters on the sidelines of an industry meeting.</p>
<p>"The issue is the following. At what conditions will the project in the north materialise? One must not believe that this can be done independently from the development of the SLN, which is the only thing concrete at the moment," he added.</p>
<p>Rambaud was attending the annual meeting of the French Minerals, Industrial Minerals and Non-Ferrous Metals Association (FMM).</p>
<p>Le Nickel-SLN is the company that oversees all Eramet's holdings in New Caledonia.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the French government, which owns 55 percent of Eramet, said it had no plans to strip part of the mining assets of Eramet in New Caledonia as part of negotiations over mining reserves in the French territory.</p>
<p>France is said to be supporting a rival project in the north of the country spearheaded by local interests and Canadian group Falconbridge.</p>
<p>The plan would deal a blow to Eramet's expansion strategy in New Caledonia as Eramet might be ordered to sell part or all of its Thiebaghi reserves to help supply the new plant.</p>
<p>Investors and analysts had feared the French state might try to oust Rambaud because he opposses any plan to limit Eramet's expansion strategy in New Caledonia.</p>
<p>But Eramet's board postponed on Tuesday a decision on a proposal by state holding ERAP to turn Eramet into a company with a separate supervisory and management board.</p>
<p>The change would have allowed the removal of Rambaud entirely or at least the curbing of his power by splitting up the roles of chairman and chief executive.</p>
<p>The board chose instead to conduct an in-depth study of the proposal, failing to provide a deadline for a decision.</p>
<p>Eramet stock hit a year-low of 247 francs on Tuesday but rebounded after the government statement to close at 277.8 francs.</p>
<p>But uncertainty surrounding the future of Eramet's management team and strategy was driving the shares lower on Wednesday. Eramet was losing 12.8 francs to 265 francs at 1237 GMT.</p>
<p>Rambaud said he "regretted" the current uncertainty surrounding the company. But he stressed a change in the legal status of Eramet company was an important decision that could not be rushed.</p>
