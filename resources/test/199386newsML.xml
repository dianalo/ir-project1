<p>The West African country of Niger holds parliamentary elections on Saturday but the main opposition is boycotting the poll, accusing the president of rigging his own election in July after staging a coup.</p>
<p>Campaigning ends on Thursday but politicians ousted in the coup led by Ibrahim Bare Mainassara last January have refused to register following his controversial election as president.</p>
<p>On July 8, the second day of chaotic polling, Mainassara suspended the electoral commission and placed his opponents under house arrest. He appointed a new commission which declared him elected with 52.22 percent of votes cast.</p>
<p>The United States said the election was fraudulent and suspended development aid.</p>
<p>Like many of its neighbours in Sub-Saharan Africa, Moslem Niger launched democratic reforms in the 1990s after the collapse of Communist rule in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>It held presidential and parliamentary elections in 1993 but government became paralysed by squabbling between then President Mahamane Ousmane and his prime minister Amadou Hama who was from a rival group which gained a majority in the 83-seat parliament.</p>
<p>Early parliamentary elections in January 1995 failed to resolve the standoff and Mainassara seized power a year later, drawing widespread international criticism.</p>
<p>Mahamane and Hama and other established policitians refused to sign up for Saturday's election, demanding that the result of the presidential poll be scrapped and the original independent election commission be restored.</p>
<p>Mainassara accused the commission of irregularities. A new electoral commission has been set up for the parliamentary poll with members drawn from representatives of all those parties who have signed up for the elections.</p>
<p>A total of 220 candidates from around a dozen parties will contest Saturday's poll, including the Union of Independents for Democratic Renewal which supports Mainassara.</p>
<p>Around 3.8 million people are eligible to vote at more than 8,300 polling stations across the vast and poverty-stricken nation. Polls open at 8 a.m. (0800 GMT) and close at 7 p.m. (1900 GMT).</p>
<p>Provisional results, which have to be verified by the Supreme Court, could be known within 48 hours of polls closing.</p>
