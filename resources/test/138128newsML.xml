<p>Swiss shares ended with a marked slump but above the day's lows on Wednesday after easing futures on the blue-chip Swiss Market Index (SMI) and early losses on Wall Street added pressure in the second half of the session.</p>
<p>"The situation is disappointing," a dealer said, noting that the bourse has been consolidating for almost two weeks. Volumes were described as moderate.</p>
<p>One trader said the SMI should find support at 3,740/50 points, adding the current low level may lead to renewed interest.</p>
<p>The SMI fell 0.86 percent, or 32.4 points, to 3,742.9. The all-share SPI shed 0.79 percent, or 19.09 points, to 2,403.43.</p>
<p>SMI index November futures slid 38.5 points to 3,740.0, hitting shares with a heavy weighting in the index.</p>
<p>Roche certificates slumped 110 francs to 9,540 francs. Ciba and Sandoz lost around one percent.</p>
<p>Among financials, CS Holding were flat at 127 francs while insurer Baloise added five francs to 2,615. UBS bearer shares were down 13 francs to 1,226.</p>
<p>Among industrials, ABB and Alusuisse shed 0.3 percent each, and Nestle gave up nine francs to 1,388.</p>
<p>Swissair and Electrowatt were among the day's winners. Swissair rebounded from recent lows, jumping nearly three percent to 999. Electrowatt ended up one franc at 481.</p>
<p>Shares of watchmaker TAG Heuer dropped 3.9 percent to 209.00 francs.</p>
