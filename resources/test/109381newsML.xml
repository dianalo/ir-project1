<p>Irish Prime Minister John Bruton accused the IRA on Thursday of trying to provoke its pro-British Unionist rivals into breaking their truce and said Republicans would be banned from Irish peace talks until they end violence.</p>
<p>The Irish Republican Army's double bombing of the British army's Northern Ireland headquarters at Lisburn on Monday was "directly and cynically aimed at destabilising the Northern Ireland Loyalist ceasefire", Bruton told the Irish parliament.</p>
<p>"We must not allow the IRA to succeed in this betrayal," he said, opening an emergency debate in the Irish parliament. On Wednesday Bruton had accused the IRA of using tactics perfected by the Nazis in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Bruton called the full-day debate to review the Anglo-Irish sponsored peace efforts in Northern Ireland in the light of the bombing, the IRA's first attack in the province for two years.</p>
<p>The prime minister insisted that the use of violence would not pressure Britain and Ireland into dropping their condition that the IRA call a new truce before its political arm, Sinn Fein, is allowed into peace talks.</p>
<p>"Let me say this to the hardliners: If the Republican movement want to be taken seriously as democrats, with all the benefits that confers, they will have to get rid of the tactical use of violence -- for good," Bruton said.</p>
<p>The IRA has denied claims that the Lisburn bombing, in which 31 people were injured, was aimed at drawing pro-British Loyalists back into the province's 25-year civil war.</p>
<p>The Protestant Loyalists declared a ceasefire two years ago to match one called by the IRA.</p>
<p>The IRA abandoned its truce in February and has since carried out a series of bombings in mainland Britain.</p>
<p>Bruton sought to reassure the Loyalists that his government had no interest in pursuing the IRA's dream of a united Ireland unless the majority of the province wanted it.</p>
<p>"We, the people, in the Republic have no agenda of a progressive takeover of Northern Ireland against the wishes of the majority of people there," he said.</p>
<p>"If there ever was such an agenda or mentality here, it has certainly gone," he added.</p>
