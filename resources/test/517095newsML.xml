<p>BOGOTA, April 17 Reuter - Colombia's peso closed 2.9 pesos higher against the the dollar at 1,052 on Thursday as foreign capital inflows from the corporate sector continued to rise, interbank dealers said.</p>
<p>The dealers attributed most of the inflow to a rush for foreign credits after a recent high court ruling that struck down a package of government economic emergency measures as unconstitutional. The measures included a 6.0 percent tax on all new foreign loans.  </p>
<p>"Businesses are quite comfortable with the financing being offered to them abroad," one trader said, referring to the flood of dollars entering the country.</p>
<p>The trader and others expect further pressure on the peso because dollars should remain plentiful as long as Colombia's high interest rates made it cheaper for businesses to borrow U.S. currency outside the country than pesos back home.</p>
<p>Dealers reported 356 trades for a total of $115 million, with the peso traded in a range of 1,055.70 to 1,051.</p>
