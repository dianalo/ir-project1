<title>RUSSIA: Russia officials seek shrs for loans restrictions.</title>

<p>Top Russian officials, including Alexander Lebed, will not challenge shares-for-loans auction results but have advised the government to put restrictions on the sale of the shares, government officials said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Security Council Secretary Alexander Lebed and Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir Potanin, in a letter to President Boris Yeltsin, said firms which won control of government stakes should be allowed to sell the shares, an official told Reuters.</p>
<p>But the September 27 letter proposed that companies holding government stakes be required to give three months notice of pending sales, sell the stakes at auction and reach agreement with the government on the offering price, the official said.</p>
<p>Russia raised millions of dollars last year when it auctioned shares in privatised companies for loans to the government, with the stipulation that Russia receive 70 percent of profits from future sales of the stakes.</p>
<p>The auctions were criticised at the time, as many of the winners were close to the organisers of the auction.</p>
<p>Critics, including Lebed, have said that the shares were sold too cheaply and Lebed had recommended that managers should not be allowed to sell their stakes until March 1997, although the auction terms specified sales were allowed from September 1.</p>
<p>That proposal was not in the September 27 letter, the official said.</p>
<p>Lebed and Potannin also proposed that foreigners be restricted to 15 percent holdings in oil companies in the programme and not be allowed to participate in auctions for Norilsk Nickel or North-West Shipping.</p>
<p>Those oil companies include YUKOS, Surgut Holding, SIDANKO, LUKoil and Sibneft.</p>
<p>Substantial stakes in RAO Norilsky Nikel and OAO Severo-Zapadnoye Parokhodstvo (North-West Shipping) were sold at auctions last year.</p>
<p>Government agencies are also considering limits on sales of Novoship (Novorossiiskoye Morskoye Parokhodstvo) but had not reached agreement, the letter said.</p>
<p>Lebed and Potanin also recommended that the government should work out a way of ensuring "effective governance" of shares not sold in the short term by managing companies.</p>
<p>"The issue may be that the government should receive profits while the shares are being managed," the official said, adding that the letter was unclear.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Alexander Lebed also said Lebed had agreed to the general terms of the 1995 auctions.</p>
<p>"The results remain unchanged and the sales will continue -- in general nothing is changed," he said.</p>
<p>He had not seen the text of the letter.</p>
<p>The official said he expected presidential approval of the recommendations within the near future.</p>
