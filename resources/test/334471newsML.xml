<headline>Yeltsin cancels Netherlands visit - Kremlin.</headline>
<dateline>MOSCOW 1997-01-27</dateline>
<text>
<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin has cancelled a visit to the Netherlands on the orders of his doctors, a Kremlin spokesman said on Monday.</p>
<p>A spokesman said doctors had advised Yeltsin, who is recovering from pneumonia, not to leave Moscow. "Because of this, agreement has been reached with the government of the Netherlands and the chairman of the European Union to postpone the visit to the Netherlands. It will take place in Moscow in the near future."</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who has been recovering in an official residence outside Moscow, had been due to hold talks in the Hague with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok on February 4. Kok is the current president of the European Union.</p>
<p>The Kremlin spokesman said that Yeltsin, acting on doctors' advice, had decided to refrain from air travel. "The president of Russia has in mind to work where he is for now," he said, reading from a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Aides have said the president is recovering well from the pneumonia, which struck just two weeks after he returned to the Kremlin following a major heart operation.</p>
<p>But he has not been seen on television since he chaired a Kremlin meeting about relations with NATO on January 6.</p>
