<p>Austria's tourism industry, once the backbone of the Alpine republic's economy but recently hard hit, welcomed news on Friday when latest figures from the winter season showed a strong pickup in visitors.</p>
<p>The first two months of the winter season, starting in November 1996, showed a provisional 6.3-percent increase in overnight stays to 10 million, the economics ministry said.</p>
<p>Tourism revenue jumped 7.6 percent over the year-ago period.</p>
<p>In December, overnight stays jumped seven percent to 7.6 million. The number of German visitors rose 10.3 percent to 4.5 million.</p>
<p>Despite the gains, the picture for the full year remained bleak, with overnight stays falling 3.5 percent to 113 million in 1996. Overnight stays by foreigners fell 3.2 percent to 84.2 million, while those by Austrians slumped 4.6 percent to 28.7 million.</p>
<p>Germans, the main visitors to Austria, chalked up 56.3 million overnight stays, down 3.6 percent on 1995. The British posted the largest drop, with 12.7 percent fewer people spending the night in Austria.</p>
