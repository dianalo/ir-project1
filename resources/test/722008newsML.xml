<p>The former Soviet Baltic republic of Latvia, dealt a setback in its drive for EU membership, will keep striving for early admission talks, the foreign ministry said on Friday.</p>
<p>The European Commission on Thursday approved in principle starting entry talks only with Latvia's neighbour Estonia and four other east European nations -- Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovenia.</p>
<p>Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania have all made big strides towards Western-style market democracy since quitting the old Soviet Union in 1991. But Estonia is seen as the most advanced of the three Baltic states.</p>
<p>Latvian Foreign Ministry State Secretary Maris Riekstinsh held out hope, insisting Thursday's decision was not final and had to be approved by EU member states.</p>
<p>"We will continue talks with our friends in the framework of the European Union to get what we think is the best solution for the Baltic states," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The best solution is that there should be equal treatment for the Baltic states and all central and eastern European countries."</p>
<p>The EU Commission decision will be finalised on July 16, the day before the EU executive makes recommendations to EU governments on the readiness of candidates.</p>
<p>Latvian diplomats said that according to their information, Latvia was deemed more prepared for EU entry in some areas than even leading central European contenders.</p>
