<p>President Nelson Mandela, angrily rejecting U.S. warnings over a proposed arms deal with Syria, said on Wednesday South Africa would deal with anyone it wanted to, regardless of outside pressure.</p>
<p>"We will conclude agreements with any country whether they are popular in the West or not. And that is what we are likely to do in this case," he told reporters at his Johannesburg home, one week before cabinet is due to take a final decision.</p>
<p>"The enemies of countries in the West are not our enemies."</p>
<p>The United States said on Monday it was extremely concerned that Pretoria planned to sell $641 million of aim-enhancing gear for Soviet-made tanks to Syria, which it says backs terrorism.</p>
<p>It threatened to cut off aid -- worth $110 million this year -- if the deal went ahead. But Mandela, in a tough statement that may sour ties further, said such pressure would not work.</p>
<p>"We will never allow any support or assistance from any country, no matter how powerful it is, to dictate our foreign policy, nor allow any country to violate our sovereignty and undermine our national pride," he said.</p>
<p>The president said it would be immoral to abandon countries that supported him in the anti-apartheid fight "on the advice of countries that were friends of the apartheid regime".</p>
<p>South Africa, like others, would sell weapons to countries even if they did not share the same values.</p>
<p>"The only provision we make is that our arms should not be used to disturb the peace in any part of the world," he added.</p>
<p>Mandela, 78, has often brushed off more muted criticism from his friendship with other U.S. bogeymen such as Libya, Iran and Cuba, despite appeals from political commentators not to alienate the world's most powerful nation.</p>
<p>Washington's latest public criticism seems to have enraged him.</p>
<p>Mandela said South Africa's smaller friends used discrete diplomatic channels to sort out differences: "They don't rush to the mountain tops and start dictating to other countries."</p>
<p>News of the arms deal was leaked by unknown sources to a Sunday newspaper.</p>
<p>Mandela said a statement on Tuesday by his foreign ministry, widely been seen as a bid to calm the row, was by no means a sign of "backing down".</p>
<p>The ministry had said any deal for what it termed "software" was not likely to be concluded before 1999, and that South Africa was not alone -- three European countries were also bidding for the business. It declined to name them.</p>
<p>Military analysts said any major NATO power had the technology to produce the targeting equipment, which reportedly would make tank firing many times more accurate -- something that has raised fears in Syria's arch-foe and neighbour, Israel.</p>
