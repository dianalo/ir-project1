<p>Data storage products maker Benelux International Ltd has discontinued its compact disk jewel boxes making factory in Northern Ireland with immediate effect, the company said in a statement on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The closure of the factory is consistent with the group's policy of down-sizing its non profit-making operations," the company's chairman Chau Kar Shun said in the statement.</p>
<p>Chau said "the closure of the factory will not have any further negative financial impact on the group" as the company had made a provision of HK$123.8 million in the audited accounts for the year ended March 31, 1996 as an exceptional item.</p>
<p>Last month Benelux reported a net loss of HK$497.97 million for the year ended March 31, including exceptional loss of HK$384.55 million, compared with HK$47.79 million yearly profit a year ago.</p>
<p>Benelux said it would make arrangements for redundancy of the employees at the factory which set up in March 1994 at Limavady, County Londonderry, with the financial assistance from the Industrial Development Board for Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Benelux said it would pay all liabilities amounting to a range of HK$24.2 to HK$30.3 million owing to its creditors and the sum of HK$30.3 million to Industrial Development Board from the proceeds derived from an orderly realisation of its assets.</p>
