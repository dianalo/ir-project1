<p>Gary Kirsten made the most of having been dropped twice to guide South Africa to 75 for one at lunch on the opening day of the second test against India on Thursday.</p>
<p>South Africa's only disappointment came with the loss of Andrew Hudson for 16. He had batted for 69 minutes when he aimed a cut at Venkatesh Prasad to offer a simple catch to wicketkeeper Nayan Mongia.</p>
<p>Kirsten was dropped off Prasad at second slip by Mohammad Azharuddin before he had scored and in the gully by Anil Kumble when he had made seven. He was 40 not out at lunch.</p>
<p>Adam Bacher, playing in only his second test, was untroubled in reaching 14 against a pace attack which was unable to find the sort of pace and bounce evident at Kingsmead where India lost the first test by 328 runs.</p>
