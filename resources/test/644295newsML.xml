<p>Russian investors piled into savings bank Sberbank  SBER.RTS but did not bite at leading shares trading near record highs traders said predicting the most liquid stocks would not move much early next week.</p>
<p>The Russian Trading System index of 22 leading shares eased to 360.94 from 360.54 on an unremarkable $33.6 million overall market volume.</p>
<p>Traders said foreign investors were buying Sberbank and cashing out of natural gas producer Gazprom after a presidential decree last week prohibited new foreign grey market buying of local shares.</p>
<p>Sberbank  SBER.RTS rose to $194.00 at the close from $187.00 on Thursday. It hit $199.0 during the day. Gazprom GAZP.RTS mustered local support and rose to $0.595 from $0.588.</p>
<p>Foreigners can buy Gazprom American Depositary Shares trading in the West.</p>
<p>"By the looks of things, money that was freed up out of Gazprom went into Sberbank," said Andrei Kukk, head of corporate securities at Rinaco Plus. "It's completely possible that Sberbank could continue to grow for a fairly long time."</p>
<p>Oil shares LUKoil  LKOH.RTS firmed to $15.55 at 1400 GMT from $1545 and Surgutneftegaz  SNGS.RTS firmed to about $0.905 from $0.886.</p>
<p>Traders said leading shares would have to wait for new money for a broad rally. But they saw money near at hand.</p>
<p>"The "blue chips" have risen so far this year that they ought to see very good new money to start a new upward rally," said Kukk.</p>
<p>"But the market will not go down since there's no reason for investors to take profits. They are switching their money into other securities but not en masse."</p>
<p>Kukk said Russian investors were also supporting the market, noting regional power company Mosenergo  MSNG.RTS remained unchanged at $1.275 despite the sale of a major 10 million-share block.</p>
<p>Traders said second-tier, low-liquidity shares were continuing to pique investor interest, and Alfa Capital trader Dmitry Lobanov said regional power company Rostovenergo rose sharply to $0.140 from $0.130.</p>
