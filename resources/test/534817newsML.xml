<p>Bank of Lithuania governor Reinoldijus Sharkinas said that the country no longer required IMF credits after its memorandum with the fund expires in September, daily Lietuvos rytas reported on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Unless unpredictable circumstances arise," there will be no need to borrow further funds from the IMF, the paper quoted Sharkinas as saying.</p>
<p>The paper reported Sharkinas as saying that the central bank was carrying out all of its obligations under the current memorandum and that it had sufficient foreign currency reserves.</p>
<p>The bank's offcial reserves at the end of March were $813.9 million, up from $795 million at the end of February.</p>
<p>Sharkinas' comments echoed earlier statements made by Prime Minister Gediminas Vagnorius, who said in March that the country had reached a stage in its transition to capitalism where it no longer needed to borrow from the fund.</p>
<p>Lithuania has borrowed a total of around 200 million SDRs from the IMF, the fund's office in Lithuania said.</p>
