<p>Male fear of being publicly shamed in a conservative, closely knit society has cut down on harassment of women in Dubai, the Gulf's most cosmopolitan city.</p>
<p>Under a recent crackdown, police are publishing pictures of so-called "Eve-teasers" in newspapers. Some of the alleged offenders are expatriates, mainly from Asian countries. Others are Gulf Arabs.</p>
<p>The risk of public disgrace in a Moslem society, where many families know each other, is acting as a deterrent.</p>
<p>This is scaring many affluent young men with nothing much to do who are being blamed for harassment, a problem rare in the sexually segregated societies of the Gulf.</p>
<p>From Gulf Arab women enveloped head to foot in traditional black robes to Europeans in revealing miniskirts, women are subjected to whistles, winks and whispers.</p>
<p>"Cases of female harassment have dropped to 19 so far this year from 69 in 1995 and 94 in 1991 since (Crown Prince) Sheikh Mohammad bin Rashid al-Maktoum decided to display pictures of these reckless youth in newspapers," said a police official.</p>
<p>"Now Eve-teasers are thinking twice before they commit their indecent acts that are an affront to the image of the country and its youth," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>"This has helped to give security to all women in Dubai and to install in men proper moral codes of conduct and decency as taught by Islam."</p>
<p>Actual proof, based on an eyewitness report, is needed before police can enforce the sheikh's nine-month-old rule. In addition, offenders' cars are impounded for up to a month and they are detained for 48 hours.</p>
<p>MOST TOLERANT OF SHEIKHDOMS</p>
<p>Dubai has a reputation for being the most tolerant of the seven sheikhdoms that make up the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Alcohol is served in hotel restaurants and foreign women wear skimpy bikinis on beaches.</p>
<p>Police in other emirates, including Sharjah and Abu Dhabi, also chase alleged offenders but do not publish their pictures.</p>
<p>According to UAE laws, a man can be fined up to $3,000 and jailed for up to a year if convicted of physical or verbal acts in public "deemed offensive to female decency".</p>
<p>Most officials say women have rarely pressed charges because of strict social traditions.</p>
<p>Young, mostly clean-shaven men, doused in heavy cologne, gather near entrances to schools and air-conditioned shopping malls to try to meet women in a country where traditions ban males from mixing with females before marriage.</p>
<p>Others throw tiny pieces of paper at women listing their mobile telephone numbers in the hope of starting a dialogue, or chase them, often in luxury Mercedes or BMWs.</p>
<p>"I am here to ensure law and order from these irresponsible minors who have nothing to do but to insult women," said a policeman patrolling undercover in a flowing white robe in a shopping complex.</p>
<p>The crackdown has sparked criticism by many men who believe similar punishment should be inflicted on women who openly flirt with them.</p>
<p>Women should dress modestly if they do not want to attract attention, they say.</p>
<p>"I have seen hooligans of all nationalities harass women," said Naji Ali, a 35-year-old Lebanese businessman.</p>
<p>"But to be fair, I must say that I have been harassed myself by women calling me on my mobile phone at odd hours and trying to arrange dates. Women also wink at me and try to pass notes to me in shopping malls."</p>
<p>TRADITIONS BREAKING DOWN</p>
<p>Greater openness, more women going to schools and universities and improved living standards after the oil boom in the 1970s have helped dilute many of the deeply rooted traditions in male-dominated Gulf society, sociologists say.</p>
<p>Foreign workers who have helped transform it from a desert backwater to a land of gleaming skyscrapers and satellite television have spread new cultural values that are often resented by older generations.</p>
<p>But some sociologists see the measures as excessive and argue that authorities are exaggerating harassment in a country where crime against women is rare.</p>
<p>Social researcher Rashid Mohammad Rashid, 36, warns against repercussions of criminalising the mostly "bored young boys" in the Gulf Arab state.</p>
<p>"By publishing his picture, you can actually destroy a young man and end his future in a society where everybody knows everybody and transform him into a delinquent.</p>
<p>"Such harassments are common all over the world," he told Reuters in an interview at the Sharjah-based Sociological Society, a non-governmental research organisation.</p>
<p>Harassment is rare in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Oman, which have managed to keep their societies segregated, social workers say.</p>
