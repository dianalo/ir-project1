<p>Singapore front-month gas oil swaps were steady late afternoon on Monday as buyers came out in support of the market at just under the $25.00 per barrel mark in expectation of refinery run cuts and physical support at this level, traders said.</p>
<p>"The market is well supported at this level ($24.90 per barrel) as people expect physical traders to buy at this price," one trader said.</p>
<p>June gas oil swaps were last quoted at $24.85-$24.95 per barrel range, largely unchanged from Friday, brokers said. The market traded earlier in the day at $24.90.  </p>
<p>Traders said market support was primarily due to expectations of crude run cuts by Singapore refiners and the sustained physical buying from a group of traders.</p>
<p>Shell Singapore, the island's largest oil refiner, said earlier that it would reduce output if the refining losses persisted.</p>
<p>"If the current margin squeeze continues, our refinery runs will be reduced," a Shell spokeswoman told Reuters.</p>
<p>Shell in January reduced output by 30,000 barrel per day for about one month when refining losses plunged to a low of up to $2.00 per barrel.  </p>
<p>Industry sources said the market was also looking to sustained buying by three traders, who have bought more than 20 million barrels of gas oil since March 3, to lend support.</p>
<p>The traders were not expected to go on a buying binge similar to that seen in late April, when in one-day they bought a record 2.44 million barrels.</p>
<p>But their expected buying would be enough to support and prevent a price collapse, industry sources said.</p>
<p>The traders on Friday bought five 150,000-barrel cargoes, two at $25.00, but later three more at $24.90 per barrel free-on-board Singapore basis for second half June lifting.  </p>
<p>The deals done below the $25.00-support mark led to speculation that the market could fall sharply, but others discounted this.</p>
<p>June fuel oil was last quoted unchanged from Friday at $100.50/$101.50 per tonne, brokers said.</p>
