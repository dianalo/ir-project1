<p>British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, after his first visit with his German counterpart Klaus Kinkel, said on Wednesday that it was improbable that Britain would join Europe's single currency in 1999 but not out of the question.</p>
<p>Reflecting comments made recently by newly-elected Prime Minister Tony Blair, Cook said it would be difficult to qualify for European economic and monetary union (EMU) with just 18 months before it is set to begin.</p>
<p>"We have not ruled it out but it is unlikely that we will be able to join in the first wave," he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Asked by Reuters afterward whether the new Labour government was setting a policy goal to join EMU later, possibly in 2002, Cook would only say, "Not a date."</p>
<p>During the news conference, Cook said Britain would not stand in the way if other countries wanted to launch EMU as planned in 1999.</p>
