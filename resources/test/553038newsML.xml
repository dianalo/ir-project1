<p>First Alert Inc said Thursday its restructuring program and cost reduction efforts have helped the company.</p>
<p>First Alert reported a first quarter loss of $0.13 a share, compared with a loss of $0.18 a share last year. The company said sales were on target at $37 million despite softness in the carbon monoxide detector market.</p>
<p>"Our first quarter results demonstrate the positive impact of restructuring and cost reduction efforts undertaken to position our company for improved and sustainable profitability in the future," B. Joseph Messner, president and chief executive, said in a statement.</p>
<p>"As a result of the restructuring program taken in the fourth quarter, we have right-sized our manufacturing operations, reduced our selling, general and administrative cost structures and are continuing the planned elimination of non-performing product lines," he said.</p>
<p>First Alert said its vendor/management team cut costs by about $2 million. It said inventory levels were reduced by $25.5 million or 34 percent from the 1996 first quarter and by $8.8 million or 15 percent from the fourth quarter.</p>
