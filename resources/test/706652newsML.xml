<p>Japan launched a full-scale cleanup operation involving hundreds of ships on Thursday as oil spilled by a supertanker in Tokyo Bay began to reach the shore in one of the country's most heavily populated areas.</p>
<p>Parts of the slick from an estimated 13,400 tonnes (100,000 barrels) of oil that leaked into one of the nation's busiest waterways reached the breakwater on the shores of Yokohama and Kawasaki, a coastguard spokesman said.</p>
<p>It is Japan's worst ever oil spill.</p>
<p>"Some oil has reached the shore and more is approaching," a coastguard spokesman told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said apart from the three points where oil had already washed ashore, parts of the slick were nearing two other areas on the shoreline.</p>
<p>Authorities were sending over 300 ships to deal with the spill, including 12 special cleanup ships, 62 from the coastguard, 31 from other government-related agencies and 231 commercial ships.</p>
<p>The Seiryu-maru, Japan's largest oil-cleaning ship, was expected to join in the cleanup efforts later in the day, he said.</p>
<p>The all-out effort follows severe criticism from Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and others about the slow start to cleanup efforts following an oil spill in January from a Russian tanker on the west coast of Japan.</p>
<p>In Wednesday morning's accident, the Japanese-operated supertanker Diamond Grace struck a reef off Yokohama, rupturing at least two of its crude oil tanks.</p>
<p>The ship, a very large crude carrier (VLCC), was carrying 257,000 tonnes (1.9 million barrels) of crude oil from the United Arab Emirates to a refinery in Kawasaki, south of Tokyo.</p>
<p>By the early hours of Thursday the oil slick covered an area about 15 km by 18 km (9.4 miles by 11 miles) in Tokyo Bay, roughly four times bigger than it had been on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hashimoto declared the spill a national disaster and asked the police, coastguard, local governments and the Japanese and U.S. armed forces to help in the cleanup.</p>
<p>Officials said there was no immediate explanation of why such a huge ship could have hit a clearly marked maritime hazard in one of Japan's busiest waterways, especially with an experienced harbour pilot aboard.</p>
<p>Yokohama maritime authorities had started questioning the pilot and the captain of the ship, the coastguard spokesman said. They and the crew were expected to be quizzed to see whether there were any violations of rules that led to accident.</p>
<p>At its shallowest point, the Nakanose undersea reef is only 12 metres (37 feet) below the surface. But it is marked by navigational aids, including not only buoys but a sophisticated radar network and computer-aided locating services.</p>
<p>The single-hull tanker, built in 1994, was chartered by Mitsubishi Oil and operated by a subsidiary of Japan's largest shipping company, Nippon Yusen KK.</p>
<p>Many recently built tankers have double hulls, meant to reduce the chances of an oil spill in case of an accident, and such double hulls have been required on ships built since 1996.</p>
<p>Under an international convention, there is automatic insurance of up to $194 million in such oil spills, with the operators or shipowners primarily responsible for the rest.</p>
<p>Late on Wednesday, the tanker left the scene of the accident under its own power and docked at its original destination near Tokyo.</p>
