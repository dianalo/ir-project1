<p>The model for a restructured Australian Wheat Board (AWB) which the Australian government has approved offers a strong basis for forward movement by the board, AWB chairman Trevor Flugge said in an interview.</p>
<p>The new structure had a very strong commercial basis and without it there would have been a high risk of failure, Flugge said in an interview.  </p>
<p>The government's decision to enshrine the AWB's single desk monopoly on export sales in legislation was a safeguard demonstrating it was unlikely to be jeopardised by the competition review of the AWB in 1999/2000, he said.</p>
<p>"We view it very positively," he said.</p>
<p>The AWB would operationally remain much as it is today but from an accounting point of view would create separate subsidiaries for functions such as the export of pools, trading and head office operations, he said.</p>
<p>Flugge also said the new AWB, which is expected to float to the stock exchange, would be called AWB Ltd.  </p>
<p>This would capitalise on the organisation's 60-year reputation around the world, where it was known as AWB, he said.</p>
<p>The holding company would undertake borrowings, hold the capital base, contain the treasury division and also operate international linkages such as that just struck with Japan's Zennoh Group, he said.</p>
<p>The AWB would have a potential minimum value of A$700 million to A$800 million if it listed on the stock exchange in the year 2001 as expected, Flugge said.</p>
<p>"It's a very substantial company by any standards," he said.  </p>
<p>Flugge said he believed a stock exchange listed AWB would be most attractive to investors such superannuation funds.</p>
<p>The dual-class share structure of the AWB was likely to make investment in the organisation's shares less attractive to some types of investors, he said.</p>
<p>This was not envisaged to be the case for institutional investors, he said.</p>
<p>The restructured Australian Wheat Board will involve A class shares, to be held wheat growers, and B class shares, with limited voting shares, to be held by equity holders.  </p>
<p>The first step of the restructure will occur from October 1 when a subsidiary of the AWB is created to undertake its commercial activities.</p>
