<p>European bourses climbed sharply on Wednesday as investors cheered President Clinton's re-election and the Republicans retaining their grip on Congress as good for business.</p>
<p>On currency markets, the dollar strengthened in the immediate aftermath of the American electorate's decision not to rock the boat, but profit-takers later moved in and took some of the shine off the currency.</p>
<p>Frankfurt and Paris chalked up strong gains as the Republican victory in the House and Senate lifted hopes that a lid would be kept on U.S. government spending.</p>
<p>Worries about big Democrat inroads into Congress had rattled markets ahead of the election because of worries that could spark increased public spending in Washington.</p>
<p>"The mark-up was on the cards after we got what looks like the ideal outcome to the U.S. election," one dealer said.</p>
<p>In Paris, shares leapt to a year's high at the opening, on the back of Clinton's return for a second term. The blue-chip CAC-40 index was up over one percent in heavy trading.</p>
<p>The best performer was Frankfurt where floor trading registered a gain of 1.4 percent at the close, helped by the Clinton win, overnight gains on Wall Street and the firmer dollar. London put on the poorest showing, with the FTSE index making only modest gains as U.S. election momentum was eroded by fears over more interest rate hikes after last week's surprise hike of 0.25 percentage point.</p>
<p>The Bank of England warned Britain's Conservative government it was unlikely to meet its 2.5 percent inflation target and would probably have to raise interest rates again.</p>
<p>In its quarterly Inflation Report, the central bank welcomed finance minister Kenneth Clarke's move raising interest rates but made it clear he could not rest on his laurels.</p>
<p>"There is now much less chance of inflation being below 2-1/2 percent during 1997. Achievement of the inflation target remains elusive," it said.</p>
<p>In Madrid, stocks rose to historic peaks at one point, sharing the general euphoria elsewhere in Europe but later slipped back. Spanish bonds also hit new highs.</p>
<p>Wall Street itself got off to a healthy start, climbing 0.75 percent on Clinton's victory. High tech stocks were up sharply, because of the defeat of Proposition 211 in California which would have made it easier for shareholders to sue companies.</p>
<p>The election fever earlier swept Hong Kong stocks to record high levels as investors viewed the results as a promise of stable economic policy and looked forward to a rally in U.S. stocks.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index of blue chip stocks closed 272.77 points higher at a record 12,775.47.</p>
<p>The dollar shed some of its early gains on the mark and yen made as the results confirmed the Republicans had retained control of Congress. But by mid-afternoon, it was back to Tuesday's closing levels.</p>
<p>The foreign exchanges were cheered in early transactions by Clinton's win but were clearly relieved his hands will be tied by a Republican Congress, regarded as pro-business.</p>
<p>"The markets are breathing a whole sigh of relief...Clinton has retained the White House and the Republicans have retained their grip on the House (of Representatives)," David Brown, chief economist at Bear Stearns said.</p>
<p>Analysts said the dollar's prospects looked healthy. "Markets believe Clinton will keep a tight rein on the Republican tax cutting agenda, while the Republican Congress will operate to keep his spending priorities in check," Tim Fox, treasury economist at Standard Chartered Bank said.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1530 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was at 1.5187 marks and 113.91 yen. compared with 1.5188 and 114.05 in late European trading on Tuesday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1530 GMT</p>
<p>The Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading British shares was up 7.7 points at 3,928.8.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was up 29.33 at 2,216.65</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt closed up 37.90 at 2,729.19.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold was fixed in the afternoon at $378.00, compared with $379.35 at the close on Tuesday. Silver was at $4.80, down four cents.</p>
