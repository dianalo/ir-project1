<p>Southern Witwatersrand Exploration Co Ltd jumped to a new two year high in robust volumes on Tuesday and dealers said the share was enjoying speculation about a possible management change.</p>
<p>Randgold and Exporation Co Ltd's announcement on Sunday that its Durban Roodepoort Deep gold mine had agreed in principle to acquire the mineral rights of SouthWits in a deal worth about 55 million rand was also fuelling trade.</p>
<p>SouthWits added six cents to 28 cents by 1037 GMT with more than a million shares changing hands. It is at its highest intraday level since March 6 when it touched 27 cents. Its previous closing high was set on June 12, 1995 when it finished at 24 cents.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of speculation that something is in the offing. It's a speculation, penny stock. Rumour has it that there is a move to get new management in," one dealer said.</p>
<p>"This would be positive. The Durban Deep business is also playing a part. The whole southwest gold field is ripe for speculation," he added.</p>
<p>SouthWits has been climbing strongly since May 15 when it closed at 17 cents but dealers said that the share had a volatile history, spiking up and down regularly.</p>
<p>Durban Deep, however, shed 100 cents to 22.50 rand -- a new year low -- amid very small volume of 2,600 shares.</p>
