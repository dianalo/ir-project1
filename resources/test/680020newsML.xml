<p>*Australian bond futures extended the easier SYCOM trend on weaker U.S. Treasuries after comments by Japanese P.M. Hashimoto suggesting that Japan may be forced to sell U.S. debt for gold.</p>
<p>*Local debt trading to again be restrained by lack of data.  </p>
<p>Australian bond futures extended their easier SYCOM trend on a weaker U.S. Treasury market after comments by Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.</p>
<p>Responding to a question after a speech at Columbia University in New York, Hashimoto said stable exchange rates are critical to Japan maintaining its holdings of U.S. government securities.</p>
<p>"I hope the U.S. will engage in efforts and in cooperation to maintain exchange stability so we will not succumb to the temptation to sell off Treasury bills and switch our funds to gold," Hashimoto said.  </p>
<p>The U.S. market was already seen as vulnerable before Hashimoto's comments ahead of a US$15.5 billion two-year note auction later on Tuesday and a US$11.5 billion five-sale on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the local market used the U.S. move to lighten up some positions, although with expectations running high for a monetary policy easing after the next week's Reserve Bank board meeting, the retracement is likely to to be limited.</p>
<p>Trading conditions are also expected to remain low-key in the absence of any major economic data before the July 1 board meeting.  </p>
<p>The market has already more or less factored in a 50 basis point cut in official 5.5 percent interest rates following the recent run of weak data, and as long as the Federal Open Market Committee keeps policy on hold at its meeting on July 1 and 2, analysts generally believe such an easing will follow.</p>
<p>September bills touched a low of 94.82 in early trading, seven basis points lower than Monday's close, but it still equates to a cash rate of 5.28 percent by maturity.  </p>
<p>---------------------(SPREADS)---------------------------</p>
<p> AUD VS   3-YR	   10-YR	* AUD 3-YR/10-YR SPREAD</p>
<p> USD	-31 (+ 04)    64 (+ 01) * FUTURES   95   (- 00.5)</p>

<p> NZD	 93 (+ 12)   -07 (+ 06) *</p>
<p>---------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The local market underperformed against the dollar bloc, reversing its recent narrowing trend, and particularly against New Zealand. The N.Z. market found a new lease of life from European buying after recently being under cloud ahead of Thursday's budget and Friday's RBNZ monetary policy statement.  </p>
