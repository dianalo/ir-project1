<p>Buoyed by higher steel prices and milder winter weather, first-quarter earnings at most U.S. integrated steelmakers will be higher than a year ago, industry analysts said.</p>
<p>"Spot market prices were lower (in last year's first quarter) and there was atrocious weather last year as well," said Chuck Bradford at UBS Securities. ("Most of the comparisons) look like they'll be positive."  </p>
<p>AK Steel Holding Corp is expected to be the industry's most profitable company in this year's first quarter, although analysts said its per-share numbers will fall slightly due to some higher costs.</p>
<p>AK Steel is expected to report earnings after market trading closes on Wednesday.</p>
<p>WHX Corp is expected to post a steep loss in the first quarter due to an ongoing strike by the United Steelworkers union that began in last year's fourth quarter.  </p>
<p>Weirton Steel Corp should post a steeper loss this year over last, due in part to expenditures related to improving operational efficiency.</p>
<p>Spot market prices, paid by customers, including service centers, fell in 1995 and essentially bottomed out in the first quarter of last year. But analysts said those prices rose continually during most of last year and that will help boost first-quarter results for most companies.</p>
<p>Steelmakers also will benefit this year from a milder winter. Harsh weather last year hampered shipping and increased shipping costs.  </p>
<p>However, contract prices for steel -- prices paid by the industry's largest customers -- were flat in this year's first quarter compared with last year, analysts said.</p>
<p>Steelmakers have supply contracts with large customers, including auto and appliance makers. Contract prices have not risen because of overcapacity in the industry that has given customers more leverage in contract negotiations.  </p>
<p>Aldo Mazzaferro, an analyst at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said this year's first quarter could show the highest spot market price comparison on a year-to-year basis, because prices could remain flat for the next three quarters this year.</p>
<p>"I think (the first quarter) could be the best comparison on pricing we'll see on a year-to-year basis," he said. "The comparisons could be increasingly less positive (for the remainder of the year.")</p>
