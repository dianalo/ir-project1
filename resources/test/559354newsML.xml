<p>Czech M2 money was up 6.2 percent year-on-year at the end of February versus 7.1 percent at the end of January, the Czech National Bank said.</p>
<p>Excluding large deposits for the sale of a strategic stake in SPT Telecom, M2 was up 7.4 percent at the end of February from 8.4 percent.  </p>
<p>"The development of money supply in February confirms that lowering of the minimum reserve requirement to the level of 9.5 percent (from 11.5 percent), effective May 8, which was decided by the banking board on April 10, was justified and adequate to the situation," central bank press spokesman Martin Svehla told Reuters.</p>
<p>Asked whether the figures meant the central bank was not planning any monetary policy changes in the near future Svehla said: "No, they are not being prepared," he said.</p>
