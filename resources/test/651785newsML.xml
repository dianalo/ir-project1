<p>Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 rubber prices were generally stable in noon trading on Tuesday, with the focus on Thailand where much cheaper prices prevailed, traders said.</p>
<p>"We heard Thai sellers have sold rubber at 47.25 U.S. cents/lb, which is below Indonesian prices. This makes local traders a little bit nervous because buyer attention is on Thailand," said one trader.</p>
<p>"Supply is quite abundant in Thailand and traders there want to get rid of the stocks as quickly as they can," said the trader.</p>
<p>Traders said Singaporean dealers bought rubber overnight at 47.50 cents/lb fob Palembang for August shipment and that a deal was also done at the same price in Medan.</p>
<p>They said offer prices were quoted at 48.25 fob Medan, 48.00 fob Surabaya, 47.625 fob Padang, and 47.25 fob Pontianak and Jambi.</p>
<p>"We can sell rubber at prices below Thailand's level, but since supply is tight in the local market, I don't think it is profitable to lower the offer prices," said another trader.</p>
<p>"In most cases, tight supply will lead to higher offer prices," he said.</p>
<p>Regional traders have said soft consumer demand and rising production will probably drag Southeast Asian rubber prices lower this week, after a recent bout of modest shortcovering.</p>
