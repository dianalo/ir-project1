<p>Russia scraped through the quarter-finals of the European championship on Friday after seeing Spain's Mike Smith miss a three-point shot that would have won the game with less than a second on the clock.</p>
<p>Russia's narrow victory over the hosts was in contrast to the other quarter-finals, in which Yugoslavia and Greece had lined up a semi-final clash with straightforward wins over Lithuania and Poland respectively.</p>
<p>Russia had to wait for the outcome of the game between Italy and Turkey to discover their semi-final opponents.</p>
<p>The Russians started nervously and failed to show the accuracy from the three-point line that had taken them through the opening phases.</p>
<p>Rafa Jofresa and Antonio Orenga had controlled the play for Spain in the first period, but the pair lost their way after the break.</p>
<p>Spain fell apart with five consecutive losses of possession, allowing Russia to force their way back from 43-36 down into a 45-43 lead.</p>
<p>The Russians kept their necks in front for the rest of the game, but were given a nervous final moment when Smith missed his three-pointer.</p>
<p>Evgeny Kissourin was fouled as he grabbed the rebound, and with time having run out was able to extend the margin of victory by one point to 70-67.</p>
<p>Earlier Yugoslavia had beaten Lithuania 75-60 and Greece came from behind to defeat Poland 72-62.</p>
<p>Yugoslavia, unexpectedly humbled by Italy on the second day, have won all their subsequent games and are again clear favourites for the title.</p>
<p>Predrag Danilovic hit 21 points and the Yugoslav dominance in the second half allowed coach Zeljko Obradovic to rest top guard Aleksander Djordjevic.</p>
<p>After winning both their groups in the opening phases, Greece looked in danger of losing their unbeaten record for a time.</p>
<p>But after trailing 45-55 early in the second period, the Greeks outscored the Poles 15-1, and cruised home untroubled.</p>
