<p>Italian agro-industry and chemicals group Montedison on Tuesday reported 1996 consolidated net profits of 298 billion lire ($175.8 million), with 1996 operating profits rising some 3.7 percent to 1.982 trillion lire.</p>
<p>A company statement said that group consolidated net debt at end-1996 fell by 15.4 percent, or 1.514 trillion lire, down to 8.324 trillion lire compared to end-1995 levels.</p>
<p>At the parent company level, 1996 net profits rose 30.4 percent to 330 billion lire while it will pay an ordinary share dividend of 20 lire a share and 150 lire a share for savings shares.</p>
<p>The group said that it was returning to paying a dividend for 1996 which would cost the group 210 billion lire, and this shareholders' payout would be made on July 21.</p>
<p>Montedison and its sister company Ferruzzi Finanziaria, now called Compart, almost collapsed under a mountain of debt in 1993 and neither has paid a dividend since.</p>
<p>The group's consolidated net profits for 1996 came after a net profit of 1.070 trillion lire in 1995, but this profit came after an extraordinary gain of 1.135 trillion lire from the setting up the Montell joint venture with oil group Shell.</p>
<p>Montedison said its group sales fell by 0.9 percent to 23.959 trillion lire in 1996 from the previous year reflecting the strength of the lira and the group's policy to re-focus and sell off non-core interests.</p>
