<p>U.S. shares in London were mixed on Thursday, with attention focusing on Philip Morris Cos Inc which was boosted by renewed hopes of a settlement of the legal battle between tobacco companies and state attorneys.</p>
<p>Dealers said Wall Street was expected to open mixed, with tobacco shares firm after U.S. President Bill Clinton told the Wall Street Journal he would not preclude interceding in the tobacco talks if hopes of reaching a deal appeared to be waning.</p>
<p>"Morris is the main feature, there is a real feelgood factor about it today," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The company's shares were up $3/4 at $46-1/4 by 1030 GMT, after having traded as high as $46-1/2 earlier, dealers said.</p>
<p>Coca-Cola Co gained $1/4 to $71-5/8 on positive media reports, dealers said, while Digital Equipment Corp firmed $1/4 to $37-5/8 on bullish comments from Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>AT &amp; T Corp fell $1/4 to $37-1/4, on expectations that Federal Communications Commission chairman Reed Hundt would criticise a possible merger between the company and SBC Communications Inc in a speech on Thursday.</p>
<p>September S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.5 points at 899.80, while the September long bond future was 1/32 weaker at 112-4/32.</p>
<p>Dealers said the main U.S. data release later in the day was the June Philadelphia Fed survey, due at 1400 GMT.</p>
