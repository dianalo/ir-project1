<p>Lawyers for convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh asked the judge on Tuesday to exclude some graphic, heart-rending testimony from the phase of the trial where the jury decides whether he spends his life in prison or is executed.</p>
<p>Judge Richard Matsch said he did not want the sentencing to turn into a "lynching" but had not yet ruled on the motion. He said he was concerned some of the proposed testimony might be overly emotional and "inappropriate."</p>
<p>McVeigh was found guilty on Monday on all 11 counts of bombing the Alfred P. Murrah federal building. The April 19, 1995, attack killed 168 people.</p>
<p>The penalty phase of the trial begins on Wednesday.</p>
<p>At a hearing outside the presence of the jury, defence attorney Richard Burr said some of the testimony could be the "verbal equivalent of gruesome photographs."</p>
<p>He said graphic photos, testimony about a victim in the rubble of the Murrah building who did not die immediately and television pictures from hospital emergency rooms of the immediate aftermath of the bombing were too emotional.</p>
<p>McVeigh, in a maroon shirt and khaki pants, smiled after entering the courtroom and, looking relaxed, shook hands with his lawyers. The mood was calm, in contrast to Monday's 15-minute tension-charged proceeding when relatives of victims wept silently as Matsch read the jury's guilty verdicts.</p>
<p>While relatives approved the verdict, they were also quick to say that no matter what happens to McVeigh nothing will restore their loved ones.</p>
<p>In the upcoming hearing, prosecutors plan to put on the witness stand survivors, relatives of people killed in the blast and rescue workers sent to the scene. They will testify on what it has meant to lose loved ones and the impact the tragedy has had on their lives.</p>
<p>During the five-week trial prosecutors portrayed McVeigh as a disillusioned Gulf War veteran who grew to hate the U.S. government and acted on his rage by setting off the huge truck bomb. Among the dead were 19 children, some in cribs near the windows of a day-care centre when the bomb exploded.</p>
<p>Testimony about the children in the sentencing hearing was expected to be especially emotional.</p>
<p>A vote for the death penalty must be unanimous. The death penalty is rarely invoked in federal cases and has not been imposed since 1963. There are currently 12 inmates on death row for federal offences.</p>
<p>By comparison, the state of Texas alone has executed 17 so far this year and plans to put another 10 to death this month.</p>
