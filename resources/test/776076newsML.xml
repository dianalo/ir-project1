<p>Fifteen people were injured on Monday in an explosion on a passenger train in southern India, authorities said.</p>
<p>In a second incident, at least 10 people, including a junior minister, were injured when a train derailed near the capital, New Delhi, news agencies said. Authorities said they suspected sabotage.</p>
<p>Police said industrial explosives carried by a passenger may have triggered the blast on the train in the southern state of Karnataka and that it was not believed to be a criminal act.</p>
<p>"We have no reason to suspect the hand of terrorists," deputy police chief D.B. Desai told Reuters by telephone from Kolar town, about 70 km (40 miles) northeast of the Karnataka capital Bangalore.</p>
<p>The train was in Malur town, about 40 km (25 miles) east of Bangalore, when the explosion occurred. It had started its trip in Madurai in neighbouring Tamil Nadu state and was headed to Bangalore, authorities said.</p>
<p>In the second incident, at least 10 passengers including junior Water Resources Minister Shees Ram Ola, were injured when 11 carriages derailed near Mahendergarh town, about 135 km (85 miles) southeast of New Delhi, news agencies said.</p>
<p>The agencies quoted authorities as saying sabotage may have caused the derailment.</p>
<p>It was the second train accident in Haryana state in the past week.</p>
<p>On July 28, at least 15 people died and more than 100 were injured when a crowded passenger train rammed into the rear of another train near the industrial town of Faridabad.</p>
