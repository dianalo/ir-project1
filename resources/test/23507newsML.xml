<p>Colombia, whose national team has seen few changes for the best part of a decade, have been forced to draft in new players for Sunday's World Cup qualifier at home to Chile.</p>
<p>Midfielders Freddy Rincon and Leonel Alvarez, two of the team's most familiar faces, have accumulated two yellow cards, forcing coach Hernan Dario Gomez to look for new blood.</p>
<p>Gomez, formerly assistant to Francisco Maturana, has so far refused to revamp the side which was eliminated in the first round of the last World Cup after a humiliating defeat to the United States.</p>
<p>Colombia, who will again be captained by the familiar figure of Carlos Valderrama, top the South American World Cup qualifying group with two wins and a draw in three games.</p>
<p>However, several key players are well into their 30s and could be over the hill when the 1998 finals come around while their replacements will be desperately short of international experience.</p>
<p>Harold Lozano, who has been waiting in the wings since the World Cup, and Luis Quinonez are expected to replace the two stalwarts with Faustino Asprilla leading the attack in the steamy Caribbean port of Barranquilla.</p>
<p>Chile, who last reached the finals in 1982, will be buoyed by a 4-1 home win over Ecuador in their last match.</p>
<p>In Buenos Aires, Argentina striker Gabriel Batistuta will have a chance to break Diego Maradona's international goal-scoring record in a match against Paraguay, who surprisingly beat Uruguay away in their last outing.</p>
<p>Batistuta is currently level with Maradona's total of 34 goals for Argentina but coach Daniel Passarella is unlikely to worry who scores goals after the last two results -- a defeat away to Ecuador and a draw away to Peru.</p>
<p>Argentina are fourth with four points, behind Chile on goal difference.</p>
<p>Passarella has become increasingly upset over the fixture list, in which the nine South American countries play each other twice, complaining that his foreign-based players do not spend enough time with the squad.</p>
<p>Batistuta's usual striking partner Abel Balbo is suspended after being sent off against Peru.</p>
<p>A tense atmosphere is expected on Sunday after Paraguayan officials said they suspected there had been deliberate attempts to injure Paraguayan internationals who play in the Argentine championship.</p>
<p>Peru, who have only two points from three games, make the dreaded trip to La Paz, which lies 3,600 metres above sea level, to face Bolivia, who beat Venezuela 6-1 in their last home game.</p>
<p>Peru warmed up this week by training at the Inca ruins of Sacsayhuaman, near the southern city of Cuzco, to the surprise of tourists visiting the site.</p>
<p>In the other match on Sunday, second-placed Ecuador, who have never qualified for the finals, are at home to minnows Venezuela, who have picked up one point in three matches.</p>
<p>The top four teams qualify for the World Cup finals, where they will join holders Brazil, the fifth South American representative.</p>
