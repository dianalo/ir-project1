<p>Slot machines at Mohegan Sun casino produced more than $1 million a day in revenues in the casino's first three weeks, about the same amount as the nearby Foxwoods resort, Hartford Courant reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>The paper cited data on Mohegan Sun casino disclosed by Sun International Hotels Limited, a company led by Sol Kerzner. He is part of the partnership that teamed with the Mohegans to build and manage the tribe's new casino in Montville.</p>
<p>Mohegan Sun's slots produced $21.2 million, with a win per machine of $425, the company said. Sun International Monday said that it produced $0.26 per share in the third quarter, up from $0.10 in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>In July, the competing Foxwoods casino set a record with a net win of $64.4 million and an average win per machine of $469. The casino in October had a net win of $53.2 million, with each machine averaging a net win of $392, the paper quoted a Foxwoods official as saying.</p>
<p>While there was concern that opening the second casino in the state would split the market, the paper said the data suggests that they instead might be growing New England's appetite for gambling.</p>
