<headline>INTERVIEW - Ashland CEO sees sustainable earnings.</headline>

<p>Ashland Inc's chairman, fresh from reporting record fiscal third quarter earnings on Monday, sees their fiscal fourth quarter starting with much of the promise with which the third quarter ended.</p>
<p>"There was some good balance in the earnings in the third quarter, and we haven't seen any major deterioration in our lines of business since we've started the fourth quarter," Ashland chairman Paul Chellgren told Reuters in an interview.  </p>
<p>A surprising portion of Ashland's third quarter profit of $126 million or $1.66 a share came from the company's refining and marketing segment, and Chellgren reckons the division will continue to contribute positively to earnings.</p>
<p>Year-ago third quarter earnings came in at $80 million or $1.16 a share before one-time gains.</p>
<p>Operating income at the refining and marketing division was $93 million compared to $53 million in the same year ago quarter, which ended on June 30.  </p>
<p>Analysts have said the division, which is to become part of a joint venture with USX-Marathon Group, has been something of an albatross for Ashland in the past few years.</p>
<p>Chellgren said declining crude prices and a widening spread between light and heavy crude will help companies like Ashland, whose refineries are equipped to convert cheaper heavy crudes into light and pricey refined products.</p>
<p>"Crude costs have come off, though that's somewhat volatile. But the crude differentials between heavy and light crudes (have come off) and we see that as being somewhat more sustainable," Chellgren said.  </p>
<p>Though refining still makes up 40 percent of its capitalization, Chellgren expects acquisitions in the chemicals sector to bring chemicals more into focus in the restructured Ashland.</p>
<p>The chemicals division, together with Ashland's APAC road paving business and its Valvoline motor oil franchise make up half of the company's capital structure, and that figure is likely to grow in the coming years, Chellgren said.  </p>
<p>Responding to a question on what some analysts say could be a liability in the future, Chellgren said the nature of Ashland's chemicals business is not as vulnerable to cyclical downturns as is commonly believed.</p>
<p>He stressed that Ashland is more a distributor of chemicals than a manufacturer, which makes Ashland less vulnerable to spiking feedstock costs than big producers.</p>
<p>"We buy more chemicals from Dow or DuPont than we do from Ashland," Chellgren said of the chemcals division.  </p>
<p>He added that the chemicals distribution business may even have a counter-cyclical quality since margins actually improve in a depressed market as purchase volumes drop and profit margins per unit expand.</p>
<p>He was also sanguine that the APAC road paving business, while cyclical, had a rosy outlook for the "foreseeable future" based on federal, state and local highway programs that look likely to feed the unit's backlog.</p>
<p>"We see for the foreseeable future, which is at least a year or two, our APAC business contintuing to have a pretty bright outlook," Chellgren said.  </p>
<p>The APAC unit's backlog stood at a record $701 million at the end of the fiscal third quarter.</p>
