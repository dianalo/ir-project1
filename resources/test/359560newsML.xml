<p>Australian Open finalist Carlos Moya hopes to make a triumphant homecoming this weekend as Spain begin one of their most eagerly-awaited Davis Cup campaigns in years against triple champions Germany.</p>
<p>What had looked like a tough tie on Spain's return to the top flight is now a much more straightforward task because of the absence of both Boris Becker and Michael Stich from the German line-up.</p>
<p>And the Mallorca-born Moya looks a dangerous prospect on clay, the preferred surface of all the top-ranked Spaniards.</p>
<p>Ironically the choice of venue for the tie had been heavily criticised by Spanish players who feared they would forfeit much of their home advantage because of the large German community living on the holiday island.</p>
<p>Since then Moya has jumped into the world's top 10 by reaching the finals in both Sydney and Melbourne.</p>
<p>The game is a sell-out as fans eager to welcome home the local hero have snapped up tickets.</p>
<p>World number 11 Albert Costa, himself a quarter-finalist in Melbourne, fills a singles berth alongside Moya. In doubles, an area where Spain have had problems in recent years, captain Manolo Santana has stuck with Alex Corretja but has replaced Tomas Carbonell with Carlos Costa.</p>
<p>In an atmosphere of euphoria, Spanish commentators have been quick to cite the strength of their team as the reason for the absence of Becker and Stich.</p>
<p>"They fled from (the tie) because of because of the fear of a humiliating defeat," wrote one journalist.</p>
<p>But despite speaking publicly of his pessimism ahead of the tie, German captain Niki Pilic may have some tricks up his sleeve.</p>
<p>Marc Goellner, 59th in the ATP rankings, beat five leading Spaniards -- Corretja amongst them -- in Marbella less than four months ago.</p>
<p>Number one singles player Hendrik Dreekman is a former quarter-finalist in the world's premier clay tournament, the French Open.</p>
<p>But Goellner, who will form the doubles pair with David Prinosil, is recovering from a shoulder injury, and is not optimistic about his side's chances.</p>
<p>"We've just been playing in Australia on a hard court and the following week ... we have to play on clay against the best in the world on the surface," he lamented.</p>
<p>Draw:</p>
<p>Friday's singles (1000 GMT):</p>
<p>Marc Goellner v Carlos Moya</p>
<p>Albert Costa v Hendrik Dreekman</p>
<p>Saturday's doubles (1130 GMT):</p>
<p>Marc Goellner/David Prinosil v Alex Corretja/Carlos Costa</p>
<p>Sunday's singles (1000 GMT):</p>
<p>Moya v Dreekman</p>
<p>Goellner v Albert Costa</p>
