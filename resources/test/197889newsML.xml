<headline>Waigel turns up late to Telekom party.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT 1996-11-18</dateline>
<text>
<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel turned up late to the biggest investor party of the year on Monday, missing the opening news conference which kicked off the high-profile listing of Deutsche Telekom stock.</p>
<p>"Frankfurt traffic was not a problem," Waigel said, as he arrived at the stock exchange here around 10 minutes after the news conference ended. "It was fog in south Germany which made me late."</p>
<p>The minister's speech to the news conference -- called to celebrate Europe's largest-ever flotation and broadcast live on German television -- had to be read out by Finance Ministry State Secretary Juergen Stark, who is Waigel's top aide.</p>
<p>Asked later whether he had joined millions of ordinary German citizens in snapping up stock in the state-owned firm, Waigel said he had reluctantly let the issue pass him by.</p>
<p>"As an insider I couldn't buy Telekom shares. But if I wasn't finance minister I definitely would have bought them," he said.</p>
