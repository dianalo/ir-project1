<p>COMEX copper futures were called to open barely changed Friday despite a fall of 1,675 tonnes in LME stocks Friday and a continued strike at Inco in Canada.</p>
<p>Norilsk Nickel in Russia, which produces some copper, said a cut in gas supplies was affecting metals output.</p>
<p>Overnight in Asia, LG Metals said the markets had no need to worry about the company's open metal options positions, but declined to comment on rumors that it faced huge losses.</p>
<p>COMEX July copper settled at 121.35 cents a lb Thursday after easing back from a fresh life of contract high of 123.60 cents.</p>
<p>On ACCESS, July last traded at 121.40 cents, up 0.05 cent from Thursday's close.</p>
<p>LME stocks now total 125,650 tonnes. Thursday, COMEX warehouse copper stocks rose 1,003 short tons to 45,964 short tons, the recent surge in New York stocks helping to prolong the COMEX June to July contango while LME remained in backwardation in the cash to three months spread.</p>
