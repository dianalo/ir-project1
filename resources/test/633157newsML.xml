<p>The mark fell against the lira amid expectations the German government will compromise over its plan to revalue Bundesbank assets in a bid to qualify for the European single currency.</p>
<p>Sources in the Bonn coalition said it may be willing to forgo plans to revalue the central bank's reserves in 1997, a scheme the Bundesbank opposed saying it would jeopardise the stability of economic and monetary union.</p>
<p>The government is is expected struggling to cut its budget deficit to the 3 percent of gross domestic product, a reference target in the Maastricht Treaty, without the help of the scheme.</p>
<p>Expectations Germany won't be able to keep countries like Italy out of EMU if it can't meet the EMU criteria strictly itself weakened the mark against the lira and kept it soft on its other European crosses.</p>
<p>"The question is how will Germany meet the 3 percent target," said Julian Jessop, an economist at Nikko Europe. "A soft EMU, with Italy in at the start, is foremost in the market's mind at the moment."</p>
<p>Mark/lira was at 982.90/3.10 at 1255 GMT from 983.35/65 late Monday in Europe. The mark was at 84.48/50 pesetas and 3.3714/16 from 84.47/48 and 3.3720/25 yesterday.  </p>
<p>German finance minister Theo Waigel said on May 24 the country will meet the convergence criteria independently of the government's plans to revalue the Bundesbank's assets.</p>
<p>Still, Waigel is seen by traders as having few other options at his disposal to plug the budget deficit. The Free Democrats, the junior coalition partner in Helmut Kohl's government, have said they will oppose any move to raise petrol taxes or to delay the reduction of the 7.5 percent solidarity income surcharge.</p>
<p>The Association of German Banks said Tuesday it backed a more flexible interpretation of the EMU entry criteria if that would avoid a collapse of the single-currency project.</p>
<p>Interpreting the Maastricht treaty more flexibly is a double-edged sword for Germany, though, since it will make it easier for countries like Italy and Spain to join EMU from the outset.</p>
<p>"I fancy the mark a bit softer from here given it looks like we're going to get a soft euro but on time in 1999," said a trader at a Japanese bank in London.</p>
