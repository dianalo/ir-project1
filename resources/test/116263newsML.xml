<p>Wells Fargo &amp; Co Tuesday reported third quarter financial results. The following is a copy of the company's news release.</p>
<p>--------------- PRESS RELEASE -----------------------</p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 15, 1996--Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (NYSE:WFC) today reported net income of $321 million for the third quarter of 1996.  Per share earnings for the quarter were $3.23.  Return on average assets (ROA) was 1.18 percent and return on average common equity (ROE) was 8.64 percent.</p>
<p>Earnings before the amortization of goodwill and nonqualifying core deposit intangibles ("cash earnings") were $4.52 per share. Cash ROA was 1.77 percent; cash ROE was 31.91 percent.</p>
<p>"During the third quarter we completed the conversion of our California customer base," said Chairman Paul Hazen.  "We owe our employees tremendous thanks for their effort during these past few months, and also appreciate the patience our customers have demonstrated throughout this transition period."</p>
<p>Since the Company's third quarter 1996 results reflect the effects of the merger beginning April 1, 1996, these results and the results for the first nine months of 1996 are not comparable to the reported results for the corresponding prior periods of 1995.</p>
<p>Net interest income on a taxable-equivalent basis was $1,299 million in the third quarter.  The Company's net interest margin for the quarter was 6.15 percent.  Noninterest income (NII) for the quarter was $643 million. Noninterest expense (NIE) for the quarter was $1,305 million, including a $22 million one-time assessment to replenish the Savings Association Insurance Fund.</p>
<p>The loan loss provision in the third quarter was $35 million. Net charge-offs in the quarter totaled $171 million, or 0.98 percent of average loans (annualized).  The largest category of net charge- offs was credit card loans ($95 million).</p>
<p>At September 30, 1996, the allowance for loan losses equaled 3.09 percent of total loans.  Total nonaccrual and restructured loans were $728 million at September 30, 1996.  Foreclosed assets were $227 million.</p>
<p>In September, the Company completed the required divestiture of 61 branches to Home Savings of America.  These branches had aggregate deposits of approximately $1.9 billion and loans of approximately $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>The Company's effective tax rate for the third quarter of 1996 was 46%.</p>
<p>At September 30, 1996, the Company's preliminary risk-based capital ratios were 11.20 percent for total risk-based capital and 7.15 percent for Tier 1 riskbased capital, exceeding the minimum regulatory guidelines of 8 percent and 4 percent, respectively.  The leverage ratio was 6.10 percent.  The ratio of common equity to total assets at the end of the quarter was 12.71 percent. -0- Wells Earnings</p>
