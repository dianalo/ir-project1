<p>Harsh weather in the Dakotas which was slowing an already-mild pace of farmer selling boosted nearby March MGE wheat futures relative to other months, traders said.</p>
<p>"Continental and Peavey are buying the front end, each of them bought 300,000 to 500,000 (bushels of March)," a trader said.</p>
<p>The traders said mills were having difficulty originating wheat due to the blizzard-like weather in the upper Midwest.</p>
<p>"Because of the weather in North Dakota, farmers haven't moved much wheat," the trader said.</p>
<p>The March/May traded at 22 cents per bushel, premium the March, they said.</p>
<p>Gains were limited by a sag in other wheat markets with diminished fears of winterkill in the U.S. winter wheat growing region weighing on the Chicago and Kansas City wheat markets.</p>
<p>At 0952 CST, MGE spring wheat futures were one cent per bushel higher to 1/2 lower, with March up one at $3.93-1/2.</p>
