<p>With a firm grip on fourth place in the European Ryder Cup standings, exciting young Dane Thomas Bjorn hopes to take a huge step towards Valderrama this weekend in Madrid.</p>
<p>Lying joint second two strokes behind the Spanish Open halfway leader Mark James, Bjorn is eyeing the top prize of 91,660 points and equivalent Ryder Cup points to help him clinch selection for the September match against the Americans.</p>
<p>If he cannot win, even second or third would do.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old from Silkeborg, last year's European rookie of the year in a season which included victory in the Loch Lomond Invitational against a field containing then U.S. Masters champion Nick Faldo and European number one Colin Montgomerie, feels another 70,000 points to go with the 240,000 he now has would be enough.</p>
<p>Then, his dream fulfilled, he can really start to play.</p>
<p>"It will be a good weekend to play well, with the biggest purse for some time," said Bjorn, whose season stuttered to a halt at the Desert Classic two months ago when a recurring neck injury forced a layoff until last week's Cannes Open in which he finished 29th.</p>
<p>"My form is almost back, and when it's not quite there I'm making the vital ups and downs to stay in contention, so I'm optimistic I can make the weekend count, having let things slip after a good start last week.</p>
<p>"My target first is to qualify for Valderrama, then go on and on, maybe to really tie things up and earn 400,000 Ryder Cup points.</p>
<p>"Once I have the worry - and the Ryder Cup has been my dream since I was a kid - of qualifying out of the way, I can really start to play, set new goals.</p>
<p>"It would be ideal to have made sure of my place by at least the British Open in July. You don't want to be worrying about qualifying with Valderrama only a few weeks away. That's the sure way to burn out.</p>
<p>"But I've set up my chance of collecting a big points total here in Madrid. If I do, and even second or third would be nice, it's going to make life easier this summer."</p>
<p>It is already going to be an exciting year for Denmark's first European Tour winner. He will play in the U.S. and British Opens and looks likely to get an invitation to the final major, the U.S. PGA, after finishing 10th in Europe last year.</p>
