<p>Moslem "terrorists" killed 31 people in an Algerian town, and a dwarf hacked off their heads with an axe and knife, the usually well-informed Algerian newspaper El Watan said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Algeria's latest night of horror was confirmed by a source close to the security forces who said they believed the 31 belonged to five families all related to a dissident member of the Armed Islamic Group (GIA).</p>
<p>"He was Sid Ali Bouhdgar, who split from the GIA and had formed his own group," the source said from Algiers, suggesting the GIA carried out the attack.</p>
<p>The authorities made no immediate comment on the killing.</p>
<p>This contrasted with their issuing a warning to the press last week after the Algiers paper Le Soir d'Algerie reported another massacre which was rapidly denied by security forces.</p>
<p>"More than 30 people had their throats cut this night," the independent newspaper El Watan quoted a resident as saying on Saturday. He said the slaughter, by around 50 "terrorists", took place overnight on Friday to Saturday.</p>
<p>"A dwarf, sometimes using an axe, sometimes a knife, cut the heads from the bodies. It was a (security) patrol, passing there a little later, which prevented the whole district being massacred," El Watan quoted the resident as saying.</p>
<p>If the latest killing is confirmed, at least 225 people -- and up to 280 according to Algerian media -- have died during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.</p>
<p>This started on January 10. Days earlier, the GIA, the most ruthless of the Algerian fundamentalist groups, warned that it would step up attacks during the month.</p>
<p>On Friday, as Algeria mourned the assassination of its most powerful trade union leader Abdelhak Benhamouda, security forces said eight people had been killed in nearby Sidi Moussa during the night of Wednesday to Thursday.</p>
<p>"This barbarous act did not exclude a baby of 13 months who was strangled by the criminals," the security forces said.</p>
<p>Bombs have killed scores in the capital, home to three to four million people, and in other towns.</p>
<p>On Saturday, local authorities, aiming to thwart car bombs, said vehicles must no longer stop in Algiers streets during the day, Algerian radio said. The ban, starting on Wednesday, will operate from 7 a.m (0600 GMT) until 7 p.m (1800 GMT).</p>
<p>Outside Algiers, scores of other people have been dragged from homes in isolated communities and choked to death as their throats were cut. The authorities blame Moslem rebels.</p>
<p>UGTA leader Abdelhak Benhamouda, gunned down in central Algiers, was known as a staunch supporter of President Liamine Zeroual, who attended his martyr's funeral last Thursday.</p>
<p>The Algerian Jihad Islamic Front (FIDA), widely believed to be a small Moslem guerrilla group operating mainly in Algiers, said it killed him.</p>
<p>"The FIDA announces its responsibility in the attack which targeted Abdelhak Benhamouda, a man who placed himself in the service of the military junta," said a FIDA statement carried by leading Algerian newspapers on Saturday.</p>
<p>In the statement, signed by FIDA's military commander in Algiers, Ahmed Abu Elfida, the group vowed more attacks.</p>
<p>Zeroual, in a move dismissing guerrilla threats, meanwhile invited legal opposition parties for talks on parliamentary elections planned for the first half of this year.</p>
<p>The talks are to be held on February 11 to discuss the formation of an independent committee to oversee the polls, said a statement carried by the official Algerian news agency.</p>
<p>Algeria has been without an elected parliament since 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) had taken a huge lead. About 60,000 people have since died in the conflict.</p>
<p>The latest massacre took place in Ktiten district of Medea, about 25 km (15 miles) south of Blida, the provincial capital, some 30 minutes drive south from Algiers.</p>
<p>El Watan said: "They arrived towards midnight and invaded the district, forcing those living there to come out to have their throats cut."</p>
