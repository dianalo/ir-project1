<p>A gloomy bullion price dragged South African gold shares down from the start of trade on Wednesday but dealers said their fall was lessened by some foreign buying at lower levels.</p>
<p>Dealers earlier said that the gold price had taken a bit of a knock following the Federal Reserve's 25 basis point hike in U.S. interest rates on Tuesday. They said higher U.S. interest rates did not bode well for bullion.</p>
<p>Some dealers said that local gold shares were also being hit by expectations of poor first quarter gold results.</p>
<p>The gold index fell 24.1 points to 1,301.9 points on the day but was off its intraday low of 1,296.6 points.</p>
<p>After an early fall on a weaker Wall Street overnight and further weighed by softer U.S. long bonds due to the Fed's rate hike, local industrial shares bumped into some buying at lower levels in the afternoon.</p>
<p>While trade was said to be quiet ahead of the Good Friday and Easter Monday public holidays, turnover was nevertheless robust at 830 million rand.</p>
<p>Dealers said February CPI inflation, due at 0900 GMT on Thursday, was unlikely to impact on the market with Wall Street's performance and local gilts likely to offer more direction.</p>
<p>The market's downside was seen limited.</p>
<p>Industrial shares ended 32.3 points down at 8,308.0 and the all-shares shed 29.9 points to 7,059.6 points.</p>
