<p>Britain's growth is understated because service sector information is sparse, lagging that of manufacturing and raising the danger of a return to the "boom-then-bust" conditions of a decade ago, analysts say.</p>
<p>"Apart from the quarterly national accounts data, which are backward looking anyway, there is not that much in the way of current information," said Mark Miller, UK economist at Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p>The latest official data for the service sector were released in March for the fourth quarter of 1996, when growth over the third quarter was 1.1 percent. The figures, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), showed year-on-year growth of 3.6 percent.</p>
<p>Analysts say employment in service industries has not stopped EXPANDING for more than two years and earnings in those sectors are growing by about five percent annually, with a major effect on spending and inflation.</p>
<p>"Three-quarters of all employees are in the services sector, which accounts for two-thirds of output, but there is no monthly indicator to tell us what is going on there," said Stuart Wetherby, UK economist at Panmure Gordon.</p>
<p>He said that the lack of information could lead to a replay of the economic conditions of the late 1980s.</p>
<p>Between 1986 and 1988, the government made large upward revisions to the gross domestic product (GDP) because the strength of the services sector had been understated for many months.</p>
<p>In a bid to rein in the economy, base rates were raised to 15 percent by October 1989 where they stayed for the next 12 months. The subsequent economic slowdown pushed the British economy into the worst recession it had seen since the 1980/81 slump.</p>
<p>Some analysts say financial deregulation at that time was a factor in the services boom and is therefore unlikely to be repeated.</p>
<p>"Yet building society de-mutualisations fall into the financial deregulation category," Wetherby said.</p>
<p>"We welcome the release of the new CIPS (Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply) service sector monthly indicators, although they do not resolve the main problem ... how to accurately measure service sector output."</p>
<p>The first CIPS indices for Britain's service sector were published on Thursday, April 3, tracking levels of business activity, new and outstanding business, price changes, operating costs and employment in the service sector. The retail and wholesale sectors are not included.</p>
<p>Analysts hope that the new CIPS indices can match the reliability of the organisations's existing manufacturing index.</p>
<p>"The CIPS service sector index has a limited track record, though obviously it will become more useful as time goes on," said Keith Davies, UK economist at analytical company 4CAST.</p>
<p>"But it is a welcome addition to an otherwise barren landscape."</p>
<p>Analysts would like to see more official data, but not at the expense of accuracy. Given the diversity of services, that is a tall order.</p>
<p>"It's not a homogenous sector. You are trying to measure output from the banking sector to output in the public sector," said Philip Shaw, UK economist at Union Plc. "The CIPS survey is useful, but perhaps if in time they expanded it to cover sub-sectors it would be even more useful."</p>
<p>The ONS is investigating how the service sector as a part of GDP can be better measured.</p>
