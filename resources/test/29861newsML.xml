<text>
<p>California's state Legislature concluded its 1996 session without acting on several key measures.</p>
<p>- Efforts to place massive school and park bond measures on the state ballot failed. The school bonds would have helped to fund construction.</p>
<p>- A measure that could have forced the state Legislature to pass balanced budgets failed in a Senate panel.</p>
<p>- A measure that could have made it easier for the San Fernando Valley to secede from Los Angeles stalled in a Senate committee.</p>
