<p>France's Socialist CFDT union said on Tuesday further short strikes had been called for Thursday at naval shipyards in a follow-up to stoppages on September 10.</p>
<p>"After the nationwide action of September 10, staff at the shipyards will be back in action after a call from their union federations," a CFDT statement said.</p>
<p>Stoppages of one to two hours have been called for at naval yards in Brest, Lorient, Cherbourg, Indret, Ruelle and Toulon.</p>
<p>The strikes are part of protests against cuts in the defence sector and plans that could mean employment location moves for staff under a labour mobility programme.</p>
