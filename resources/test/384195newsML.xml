<p>Japanese stocks in London edged lower on Tuesday as last week's momentum fizzled out in the wake of Monday's public holiday in New York, traders said.</p>
<p>The Nikkei 50 index of leading shares traded in London fell 17.76 points from yesterday's London close to 1,431.77, after Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index fell some 279.90 points, or 1.49 percent, to close at the day's low of 18,470.75.</p>
<p>"It has been very quiet," one trader said, "the week in London hasn't really got going yet." There was some buying interest in Sony, which rose 10 yen from the Tokyo close, he said.</p>
