<p>IBCA, the European credit rating agency, said it had placed the long-term AA and short-term A1 plus ratings of East Midlands Electricity Plc on RatingWatch with negative implications.  </p>
<p>The move follows the announcement of an agreed takeover bid by Dominion Resources Inc, IBCA said in a statement.</p>
<p>Dominion is the parent group of regulated electricity utility operations based in Virginia, U.S., IBCA said.</p>
<p>"Dominion have indicated in the medium-term, the acquisition will be financed with a mixture of sterling debt (65 percent), including a bond issue, and equity (35 percent)," IBCA said.</p>
<p>Previous acquisitions in the British utility sector have typically seen between 50 to 75 percent of the acqusition price met with non-recourse funding to a speacial purpose British-based acquisition vehicle, where debt-servicing obligations effectively lie with the utility, IBCA said.</p>
<p>"In addition, existing ring-fencing regulations for acquired RECs would leave East Midlands financial profile vulnerable to structural subordination withing the larger Dominion group,"IBCA said.</p>
<p>IBCA said the outstanding 25-year 150 million stg bond, issued in 1991, contatins restrictions on dividend payouts in the event of a change in ownership.</p>
<p>"The maximum dividend that East Midlands may pay to a new owner is one third of the past three years' dividend payments (which total 885.6 million stg, including sizable special dividends)," IBCA said.</p>
<p>It said this will theoretically allow East Midlands to pay dividends that more than cover finance costs on the 1.3 billion stg acquisition funding.</p>
<p>"IBCA will be monitoring this aspect of the bid's development closely," it said.</p>
<p>IBCA noted that the deal faces regulatory hurdles in the U.S. and Britain.</p>
