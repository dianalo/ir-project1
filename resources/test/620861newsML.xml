<p>Gold 24 carat closed 15 rupees higher at 4,775 rupees per 10 gramme against the previous close of 4,760 rupees but down five rupees from the opening level of 4,780 rupees, dealers said.</p>
<p>The market opened higher tracking a rally in world prices but very poor demand in the later session pulled down prices towards the close, they said.</p>
<p>Gold was down by 10 rupees per 10 gramme on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Gold biscuit (116.50 gramme) closed 100 rupees higher at 55,800 rupees per piece against the previous close of 55,700 rupees but down 100 rupees from the opening level of 55,900 rupees as profit-taking at the higher level trimmed early gains. Biscuit prices were down by 100 rupees per piece on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Silver (.999) closed five rupees higher at 6,880 rupees per kg against the previous close of 6,875 rupees but down five rupees from the opening level of 6,885 rupees per kg as sluggish industrial demand dragged prices lower towards the close after a firm start on upsurge in the world market.</p>
<p>Silver was down by 10 rupees per kg on Tuesday. (Conversion $1=35.81 rupees)</p>
