<p>U.S. Midwest direct hog prices Monday were seen selling steady with a weak tone amid ideas weekend rainfall may stall fieldwork and free farmers to market hogs, resulting in large runs, livestock dealers said.</p>
<p>Cash hog prices also were said to be vulnerable as this week's price advance outran pork gains and eroded packer operating margins, which could lead to slaughter cutbacks, they said.</p>
<p>Hog marketings also could escalate Monday if early prices are lower, dealers said. Lower prices could spark panic selling of hogs producers may have been holding back.  </p>
<p>"Nothing like a $0.50 or $1.00 lower opening after a week of higher prices to get people to unload the hogs they've been holding back," one hog buyer said.</p>
<p>Interior Iowa and southern Minnesota top prices for hogs delivered to plants on Monday could range from $57.00 to $57.50. Friday's price of $57.50 was $3.00 higher than a week ago, USDA statistics showed.</p>
<p>Illinois top prices at plants were seen steady at $57.50. Friday's top of $57.50 was $2.50 higher for the week. Indiana/Ohio top prices for hogs delivered to the plant could also range $57.00 to $57.50.</p>
<p>The Indiana/Ohio cash hog top of $57.50 Friday also was up $2.50, compared with a week ago.</p>
