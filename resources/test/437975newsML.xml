<p>Southeast Asian cocoa values surged on Wednesday powered by rallies in New York and London overnight, with the Malaysian and Indonesian markets optimistic of extending gains into next week, traders said.</p>
<p>Indonesian traders said supplies were beginning to increase in the early stage of the main crop harvest, with some growers selling pods that were still green to capitalise on the price rise.</p>
<p>They said they expected New York's May contract to open higher by between $30 to $40 a tonne later on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>Their Malaysian counterparts said there had been active demand by grinders and consumers over the past week.</p>
<p>Indonesian cocoa was quoted at 2,915-2,950 rupiah a kg in Ujung Pandang, capital of the key growing region of South Sulawesi, compared with between 2,650-2,670 rupiah a week ago.</p>
<p>The Malaysian Cocoa Board quoted Standard Malaysian Cocoa Grade 1A out of Tawau, the country's best-growing area, at an average 3,300 ringgit against 3,040 ringgit a week ago.</p>
<p>Dealers said the board's prices were based on London prices, but with a discount based on volume.  </p>
<p>"It's not reflective of the actual physical market, which may be a couple of hundred (ringgit) higher," said the general manager of a cocoa products firm.</p>
<p>"The market is very active," one Indonesian trader said. "I am buying about 40 to 50 tonnes per day."</p>
<p>"I expect local prices to remain firm next week, as prices in New York are likely to continue moving upwards through the week because of the prevailing bullish sentiment," he said.</p>
<p>Indonesian cocoa players had been lamenting over the generally weak prices just two weeks ago as they watched with envy the meteoric rise of coffee prices in London and New York.  </p>
<p>But a sudden change in sentiment has seen cocoa prices jump this week. New York cocoa prices surged for the second straight day on Tuesday, rallying to their highest close in nearly seven months on heavy interest by speculators.</p>
<p>Most-active May futures climbed $59 a tonne tonne, or more than four percent on the day, to close at $1,451.</p>
<p>The bullish sentiment was triggered, in part, by Phibro director Anthony Ward's remarks on Monday that he believed London prices could hit 1,500 pounds sterling because of a structural deficit. On Tuesday, London's key May contract closed at 1,010 sterling, up 29 sterling.  </p>
<p>Indonesian traders also attributed the upbeat mood to Ivory Coast Commodities Minister Alain Gauze's statement that the country's 1996/97 cocoa crop will be below one million tonnes, and that 800,000 tonnes had already been sold.</p>
<p>"The statements by Phibro and the Ivory Coast have certainly switched the spotlight to the cocoa market," one trader said. "I think New York will open higher today, but I cannot forecast by how much at this stage."  </p>
<p>"Indonesian cocoa prices are at their highest in almost a decade," he said. "I have not seen such prices since I became involved with cocoa 10 years ago. Prices are rising not because of local fundamentals but because of the terminals."</p>
<p>Malaysian traders also pointed to the remarks by the Ivorian Minister and Phibro for the bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>"It's difficult to guess whether the Malaysian price will go up again next week, although the possibilities are very strong," said a dealer with a foreign commodities house in Singapore.</p>
