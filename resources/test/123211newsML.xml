<p>The Russian government might have to consider changing its economic course by borrowing heavily on financial markets if tax collection does not improve, Interfax news agency quoted Finance Minister Alexander Livshits as saying on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Never before have we been so close to the point, where we either collect revenues, or we shall have to think how to change course," Livshits told a cabinet meeting, Interfax said.</p>
<p>The change of course would mean massive borrowing on the markets, which would divert Russia from the current course of economic reform, he said, according to the agency.</p>
<p>Currently the finance ministry is seeking to curb the volume of domestic borrowing, issuing only enough government securities to cover maturing issues.</p>
<p>But the low level of tax collection remains one Russia's most painful economic problems. State coffers have so far received only 74 percent of targeted revenues, the government said in a statement earlier on Thursday.</p>
<p>Livshits said he fiercely opposed the idea of widening the budget deficit, adding that would mean a switch to a different economic policy.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund, whose mission is currently in Moscow to discuss releasing a new tranche of its $10 billion loan, is worried about the low tax revenues in Russia.</p>
<p>It delayed payment of one tranche earlier this year on concern over the tax shortfall.</p>
<p>However, the IMF insists that Russia adhere to key economic parameters, agreed with the Fund, including a target for the budget deficit.</p>
