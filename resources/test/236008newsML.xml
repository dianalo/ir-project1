<p>Asia Pulp &amp; Paper said on Thursday it was confident it would be able to sell expanded output from paper mills scheduled to begin production in 1997.</p>
<p>"We have a lot of new capacity which will start commercial activity in 1997," Chief Financial Officer Hendrick Tee said during a conference call. "We are ready and confident that we can sell this new capacity in 1997."</p>
<p>To do this, the company said it had hired more marketing staff, particularly in Japan, Europe and Korea.</p>
<p>The company has expanded an office in Japan and a distribution network in China, while opening several ofices elsewhere in Asia.</p>
<p>Two pulp mills at its Indonesian PT Indah Kiat Pulp &amp; Paper Corp unit, with estimated capacity of 135,000 tons and 500,000 tons per year, were set to start commercial production in 1997, Tee said.</p>
<p>In Serang, a corrugated paper mill, with estimated annual capacity of 280,000 tons, was also set to begin commercial production in 1997, Asia Pulp said.</p>
<p>Two boxboard mills there, with total capacity of 350,000 tons a year, were also due to come on line in 1997, Tee said.</p>
<p>Also in Indonesia, two coated and uncoated freesheet paper mills at the Pindo Deli facility in Karawang were scheduled to go on stream commercially in 1997, with capacity of 500,000 tons a year, the company said.</p>
<p>Its Yalong Paper Products Co Ltd facility in Khusan City, China, was set to start commercial production by mid-1997, the company said. Two more plants in China, which made paper tubes, cardboard boxes and corrugated board, were also set to begin commercial production around then, it said.</p>
<p>A coated freesheet mill in India would begin production in 1997, with estimated annual capacity of 110,000 tons.</p>
