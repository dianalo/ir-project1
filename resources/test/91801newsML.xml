<p>Stocks rose further into record territory Wednesday as financial shares in particular benefited from a bond market rally.</p>
<p>At 1 p.m. EDT, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 21.99 points to 5,926.89, a day after closing above 5,900 for the first time. In the broader market, advancing issues outpaced decliners by 2-1 on 260 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite index climbed 8.94 to 1,230.45. The Standard &amp; Poor's index of 500 stocks added 3.78 to 692.86.</p>
<p>A firm bond market boosted stocks and helped push shares of some interest rate-sensitive financial stocks to new highs for the year.</p>
<p>The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 12/32 to yield 6.85 percent, down from 6.88 percent at Tuesday's close.</p>
<p>"There's a bit more optimism and the computer and financial stocks have done particularly well," said Alan Ackerman, market strategist at Fahnestock &amp; Co.</p>
<p>First USA Inc. rose 2-3/4 to 59-5/8 and Citicorp gained 1 to 92-1/2, just shy of its 92-7/8 year high set early Wednesday. Chase Manhattan Corp. also hit a year high of 81-3/8 before slipping back to 80-7/8, up 3/8.</p>
<p>The rally in financial stocks mirrored a strong run in the bond market that began Tuesday, when the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) index eased inflation jitters.</p>
<p>"A lot of this was kicked into gear by yesterday's NAPM index," said Chris Dickerson, an analyst at Global Market Strategists Inc. "The continuation of the rally into Europe also helped set the tone."</p>
<p>In London, the FTSE 100 index closed at 4,015, setting a record for the second straight day and the index's first close above 4,000.</p>
<p>Despite broad buying interest, analysts noted that volume was rather low, indicating the move could be flagging.</p>
<p>"The rally is very quiet," Dickerson said. "Also, you certainly would expect bonds to take some profits ahead of (Friday's) employment report."</p>
<p>Among individual issues, Baby Superstore Inc. jumped 4-5/8 to 24-1/2, after Toys R Us said it would acquire the retailer in a stock swap valued at about $376 million. Toys R Us shares gained 2-1/8 to 31.</p>
<p>AT&amp;T Corp. rose 3/4 to 39-5/8 after it announced plans to offer digital wireless communications services in 40 markets. AT&amp;T also said it planned to expand the rollout to additional markets.</p>
<p>Orthologic Corp. slid 4-1/4 to 7-1/8 after the company warned late Tuesday that its third-quarter results would be below analysts' expectations. It was Nasdaq's most active issue.</p>
<p>HCIA Inc. staged a mild rebound from Tuesday's massive sell-off, gaining 1-3/4 to 34-3/4. Shares in HCIA fell by nearly 50 percent Tuesday after the company warned it would not meet Wall Street profit estimates.</p>
