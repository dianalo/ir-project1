<p>The continuing erratic behaviour of American Jeff Tarango wrenched the French Open spotlight away from an immaculate clay display by world number one Pete Sampras at Roland Garros on Wednesday.</p>
<p>While Sampras advanced smoothly to the third round of the only grand slam tournament he has never won, Tarango was involved in a tempestuous battle against Thomas Muster which culminated in the Austrian refusing to shake hands with his opponent and accusing him of acting unprofessionally.</p>
<p>The American, in turn, alleged Muster had deliberately tried to distract him by grunting during rallies, reviving memories of the extraordinary scenes he caused at Wimbledon two years ago.</p>
<p>On that occasion, he was banned from the championships for a year and handed a record $15,500 fine after storming out of his third round match against Germany's Alexander Mronz and abusing umpire Bruno Rebeuh who, before he retracted the allegations, he described as "the most corrupt official in the game."</p>
<p>This time he at least completed the match, going down 7-5 1-6 6-2 6-1, but enraged Muster in the process by mimicking his mannerisms, complaining about the Austrian's grunting and serving underarm.</p>
<p>"At one point it was just like an echo in my head, he was grunting so much," said Tarango, insisting he had never had any previous disputes with Muster.</p>
<p>"I think probably his ego was a little bruised. If you take a little bit of his limelight he doesn't like it. That's probably the story.</p>
<p>"I don't go out to dinner or the casino with him. He might be best friends with Bruno Rebeuh for all I know.... Maybe he has a problem with me I don't know about."</p>
<p>Muster admitted that at one stage he had aimed an overhead smash at his opponent but was adamant that Tarango was to blame for the ill-tempered scenes.</p>
<p>"I didn't say anything bad to him, I just said 'Don't shake hands with me now,'" said Muster, claiming Tarango was simply trying to win favour with the crowd.</p>
<p>"It is the first time I have ever done this, but I have my reasons. We know the history of Jeff. He's not an easy guy and everyone knows that. I know I'm not always great, but anything I do like querying line calls is within the rules. I don't think what we saw today was very professional."</p>
<p>Popularly known as 'The last Tarango in Paris', Tarango's first round match against Marcello Filippini of Uruguay also ended in acrimony, and the American is now fast exhausting the patience of both fans and officials.</p>
<p>His best policy would be to forget the histrionics and try and emulate Sampras, who looked highly impressive during a 6-1 6-2 6-2 demolition of Spain's Francisco Clavet which took just 87 minutes.</p>
<p>The Spaniard was sunk without trace by some high-quality shot-making which suggested that any uncertainty Sampras used to experience at Roland Garros no longer exists.</p>
<p>"I don't care what the surface is, if I'm playing well I'm going to be tough to beat," claimed the top seed, so intent on maximising his chances of winning the title that he has started storing his rackets in a courtside fridge.</p>
<p>"If you keep them cool they don't lose their tension, which sometimes happens if I leave them out in the heat," he explained.</p>
<p>Like Sampras, defending champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov has also yet to drop a set and the pair are starting to concern those who predicted the tournament would be a simple showdown between a succession of Spanish clay specialists.</p>
<p>The Russian third seed beat France's Guillaume Raoux 7-5 6-3 6-4 in 94 minutes and the Parisian clay again appears to be bringing the best out of him.</p>
<p>He is now scheduled to meet France's Cedric Pioline, with both players well aware that Muster, below his best in recent months, is the only other remaining seed in their quarter.</p>
<p>On another dry, sunny day, Spain's Carlos Moya was the only seed to fall by the wayside, losing 6-4 4-6 7-5 6-3 to compatriot Albert Portas.</p>
<p>Among the women, there were wins for all the seeded players including Steffi Graf who enjoyed a 6-3 6-3 win over last year's French junior champion Amelie Mauresmo of France.</p>
<p>The world number two remains on course for a quarter-final meeting with seventh seed Conchita Martinez who cruised past the flimsy challenge of American Chanda Rubin 6-3 6-0.</p>
