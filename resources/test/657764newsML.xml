<p>German steel and engineering group Thyssen AG said on Thursday it had signed an agreement to buy the largest U.S. machine tool maker, Giddings &amp; Lewis, for $21 a share in cash, or $675 million, outdoing a hostile bid from a U.S. rival.</p>
<p>G&amp;L, the biggest machine tool maker in the U.S., will fit well with Thyssen's long-term strategy to become a global auto components supplier, a trend well in place long before it was sidetracked by the merger of its steel division with the Krupp Group, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Thyssen offer overtakes a rival $19 a share offer made in late April by Harnischfeger Industries Inc, which G&amp;L management rejected last month as inadequate.</p>
<p>Thyssen chairman Dieter Vogel said in a statement: "Giddings &amp; Lewis is the ideal fit with Thyssen to enhance our core production systems business."</p>
<p>G&amp;L chief executive officer Marvin Isles said:</p>
<p>"Our board of directors unanimously concluded that this transaction with Thyssen is in the best interests of all Giddings &amp; Lewis' constituencies. At $21 per share in cash, Gidding &amp; Lewis shareholders will receive exceptional value."</p>
<p>About half of G&amp;L's sales are to the auto industry, including key makers Chrysler Corp and General Motors Corp, making it a particularly attractive target, analysts said.</p>
<p>"Thyssen aims to double sales in production systems by the year 2000, and regionally, North America is an area where it wants to expand," said steel analyst Werner Friedmann at Bank Julius Baer in Frankfurt.</p>
<p>The bid, together with Thyssen's purchase earlier this year of U.S. metals trader Copper &amp; Brass Sales Inc could signal the start of a more aggressive takeovers stance in the U.S., analysts said. Copper &amp; Brass has annual sales of about $500 million. The purchase price was not disclosed.</p>
<p>The G&amp;L purchase was reminiscent of Thyssen's 1978 purchase of Budd Co of the U.S., which Thyssen has turned around into its flagship auto-parts company. Through Budd, Thyssen is already the largest foreign employer in the state of Michigan.</p>
<p>Thyssen also owns U.K. auto parts maker Tallent Engineering Ltd, and has its eyes on the Asian market as well. Overall, the auto industry is Thyssen's largest single customer segment.</p>
<p>Terence Sinclair at Salomon Brothers in London agreed the G&amp;L bid should be viewed positively by G&amp;L as well as Thyssen shareholders.</p>
<p>"G&amp;L has been losing money, but aims for a profit this year," Sinclair said. "Thyssen will get in at the bottom."</p>
<p>While G&amp;L makes relatively low-tech machine tools, it offers an entry to the GM business, notoriously hard to access and potentially very lucrative, Sinclair said.</p>
<p>G&amp;L has eight plants in the U.S., and one each in Canada, Germany and Britain. Its shares closed in New York on Wednesday unchanged at $19.</p>
<p>Thyssen said the bid, by its Thyssen Holding Corporation unit, would be made within the next few days. Once a majority stake is acquired, G&amp;L would be integrated into the core operations of Thyssen Industrie AG.</p>
<p>G&amp;L would pay Thyssen a fee of $20 million plus $3 million in expenses if under certain circumstances the agreement were terminated by G&amp;L for another acquisition transaction.</p>
<p>The merger is subject to antitrust revieew in the U.S., Germany and other countries, and to approval by G&amp;L shareholders.</p>
