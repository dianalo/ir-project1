<p>The overnight interbank rate stayed in the 6.5-7.0 percent range on Tuesday, supported by borrowing by small to medium-sized banks, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The smaller banks seem to be short of funds though trading volumes have not been big," said a dealer at a Malaysian bank. "Seven percent was taken but it has now come off slightly."</p>
<p>Dealers said lenders' reluctance to lend lower amid persistent rumours of a new bond issue had also kept interbank rates steady.</p>
<p>But rates could be pressured again with more funds coming into the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>They said there will be another maturity of a 500-million ringgit Bank Negara bills issue on Friday after bills worth a similar amount had matured last Friday. Both maturities have not been matched by any issue.</p>
<p>In addition there will be a maturity of a 900-million ringgit long term government bond issue on May 15.</p>
<p>Dealers said they expected the central bank to call for more Bank Negara bill issues next week.</p>
<p>Earlier, interbank rates were generally steady with interest focusing on three-month money.</p>
<p>One-week and two-week money was at 6.8/7.0 percent against 6.9/7.1 on Monday, and three-week was at 7.00/10 percent against 7.10/20.</p>
<p>One-month money at 7.25/30 percent, three-month at 7.30/35 and six-month at 7.35/40, were all unchanged.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange were generally higher at the close on expectations of softening of interest rates, futures market dealers said.</p>
<p>Dealers noted buying by foreign players.</p>
<p>The benchmark three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was up two points at 92.69, or an implied yield of 7.31 percent.</p>
<p>December rose two to 92.68, or 7.32 percent.</p>
<p>March 1998 was up three to 92.61, or 7.39 percent and June 1998 was up four to 92.60, or 7.40 percent.</p>
