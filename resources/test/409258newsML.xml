<p>Remember Tom Hanks shaking hands with U.S. president John F. Kennedy -- assassinated in 1963 -- in the 1994 hit movie "Forrest Gump"?</p>
<p>Or those fearsome dinosaurs stomping through a verdant island in "Jurassic Park"?</p>
<p>It would have been impossible to pull off those visual stunts without the aid of powerful computer-generated special effects which blended actors and monsters into one scene.</p>
<p>Those special effects required supercomputers -- which were once themselves expected to go the way of the dinosaur as desktop workstations became smaller and more powerful.</p>
<p>But these powerful high-performance computers -- the largest is as big as a tennis court -- are finding new uses in universities, manufacturing, and automobile and aerospace plants.</p>
<p>SUPER GROWTH IN ASIA</p>
<p>Asia is seeing rapidly growing use of these powerful systems, which are capable of storing huge amounts of data, processing a trillion calculations in a blink of an eye and presenting them in visually appealing three-dimensional forms.</p>
<p>"The whole stage is changing for supercomputers," said Eric Pitcher, senior director of the university marketing unit of Cray Research Inc, a world leader in supercomputers.</p>
<p>"In the past, defence used to contribute the bulk of the earnings, but not anymore. Now, it's academia, manufacturing, automobiles, aerospace that are the main customers," he said during a recent visit to Singapore.</p>
<p>Costing from US$1.4 million to hundreds of millions of dollars, supercomputers are rapidly recognised as necessities in oil and gas exploration and weather forecasting -- two areas in which they are widely used in Asia.</p>
<p>The total worldwide market for supercomputers today is about $2 billion a year, Pitcher said. Silicon Graphics' Cray Research has about half of the world market, he said.</p>
<p>About 50 percent of Cray's business comes from universities, where engineers and scientists use the machines in research.</p>
<p>In manufacturing, supercomputers are used mainly in oil and gas exploration and in the pharmaceutical industry for the development of new drugs.</p>
<p>They are also used for crash-test simulations by the automobile industry and flight simulations by aircraft makers. Their use in movies like "Forrest Gump" and "Jurassic Park" has wowed audiences.</p>
<p>ALMOST UNLIMITED POTENTIAL</p>
<p>Experts said it was unlikely that existing workstations would displace supercomputers.</p>
<p>"Supercomputers allow the creative use of high performance computing, solve problems which would otherwise not be solved because of limitation of computational powers available," said Peter Boek, director of the National Supercomputer Research Centre (NSRC) in Singapore.</p>
<p>"The problems you can tackle with a spade and a bulldozer are different. You can shift mountains with a bulldozer, but you can't do that with a spade," Boek said.</p>
<p>About 200 Cray systems are sold each year and their share of sales in Asia is growing, company officials said.</p>
<p>Half of Cray's business is in the United States, a third in Europe and the remainder in Asia, Pitcher said. There are more than 100 Cray machines in Japan alone.</p>
<p>In China, international oil companies are using the systems to explore for oil in defunct wells, according to Abdul Wahab, branch manager of Silicon Graphics Sdn Bhd in Malaysia.</p>
<p>The systems have also won the heart of Malaysian state-owned national oil company Petronas, which switched to using supercomputers in oil and gas exploration in 1995 instead of using workstations and plotters.</p>
<p>"Supercomputers enable them to process the seismic data in three dimensions. Previously, everything was two-dimensional -- only in length and depth. It was very tedious, cumbersome and inaccurate," said Wahab.</p>
<p>"They had to take a paper and plot everything out. Now, all these are done by the supercomputer -- the visualisation and processing of the data," Wahab said.</p>
<p>"PREDICTING THE UNPREDICTABLE"</p>
<p>In Asian agriculture, the systems have become important in weather forecasting and preventing weather-related disasters. The Chinese Meteorological Agency is among Cray's customers.</p>
<p>"Supercomputers are helping to predict the unpredictable," Wahab said.</p>
<p>And this they do in the shortest possible time, experts said.</p>
<p>Alex Lee of ST Aerospace said computation time for his aircraft simulation project was reduced by more than 7.5 times to 34 hours on a Cray T94 supercomputer the size of a clothes closet from 256 hours on other systems.</p>
<p>Christopher Ting of the Defence Science Organisation uses the Cray T94 in his research into the structure of proteins.</p>
<p>"We applied the Cray T94 to apply directly on an HIV protein, where the exact structure is not known," Ting said. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a deadly disease better known as AIDS.</p>
<p>Ting said the supercomputer's ability to take in new data and process it immediately had enabled him to assess the structure of the human immunodeficiency virus more accurately, despite its volatile nature.</p>
<p>He said the Cray's computation time is up to 10 times faster than a new model workstation.</p>
