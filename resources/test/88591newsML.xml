<text>
<p>On its Internet web site, the Australian Financial Review reported from its Wednesday edition that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan sees no immediate inflation risk in the U.S.</p>
<p>The Australian Financial Review quoted Australian Treasurer Peter Costello, after a briefing with Greenspan in Washington, as saying the Fed chief was "very optimistic."</p>
<p>"He indicated to me that he saw no threats to inflation down the track," the Review quoted Costello as saying. "I don't think there is any expectation...at the moment that (U.S.) rates are going to rise," Costello said.</p>
<p>U.S. financial traders said Treasury bonds and Treasury bond futures rallied on the report.</p>
<p>Costello and a spokesman for the Fed could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
