<p>The Clinton administration said Monday that significant progress has been made in achieving the open market objectives of a 1995 car trade deal with Japan.</p>
<p>A report prepared by the Commerce Department and U.S. Trade Representative's office, following consultations last month with Japan, said that sales in Japan of cars manufactured in North America by U.S. carmakers rose by 40 percent during the first half of 1996, compared to the same period in 1995.  </p>
<p>Exports of North American parts to Japan were up 11 percent in the first half of the year, compared to a year earlier, the report said.</p>
<p>"Numerous U.S. parts companies that were previously unsuccessful in Japan now report significant new contracts and sales opportunities," the report said.</p>
<p>General Motors Corp, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler Corp have signed on 114 new dealerships in Japan, but the U.S. car makers wanted to get 200 new outlets by the end of the year. The report said U.S. trade officials will continue to monitor that aspect of the agreement.  </p>
<p>The report said that deregulation of Japan's tightly controlled automobile repart market has resulted in new opportunities for sales of U.S.-made products. But it noted that of eight parts removed from the so-call critical parts list, only two offered any potential for foreign sales in Japan's repair market.</p>
<p>The report also said that sales of U.S. parts to Japanese manufacturers rose in 1995, but the rate of growth has slowed dramatically. It said U.S. officials in talks with Japanese officials expressed concern that Japanese manufacturers continue to discriminate against U.S. suppliers.</p>
