<p>NATO-led peacekeepers shot dead a notorious Bosnian Serb police chief and arrested a hospital director on Thursday in an offensive against war crimes suspects wanted by the United Nations.</p>
<p>The two men were sought for brutal ethnic cleansing operations against Moslems and Croats in northern Bosnia in 1992 that aroused worldwide condemnation.</p>
<p>NATO said Simo Drljaca, who commanded police in the northwest Bosnian town of Prijedor until last year, was killed in self-defence when he fired on soldiers trying to arrest him. A British trooper was slightly wounded.</p>
<p>Prijedor hospital director Milan Kovacevic was seized at work and taken to the U.N. war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands where he is wanted for complicity in genocide.</p>
<p>The sudden NATO action panicked Bosnian Serb leaders who feared peacekeepers might pounce next on indicted war criminals like ex-President Radovan Karadzic and army commander General Ratko Mladic, who have so far been unmolested.</p>
<p>Signalling a switch to an apparently tougher policy, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said: "I think all those who are subject to indictment ... should be on notice that at some point in time they will be brought to justice."</p>
<p>Bosnian Serb tensions have been fanned by the tribunal's disclosure this month that it has a list of suspects who have been indicted secretly, on top of the 76 accused publicly.</p>
<p>Drljaca and Kovacevic were not on the public list but were charged in sealed indictments issued in March, according to a Western official in Sarajevo.</p>
<p>NATO denied the peacekeepers broke their own ground rules and hunted the men down although the raids, codenamed "Operation Tango", showed every sign of advance planning.</p>
<p>Spokesman Colonel Steven Rausch said they were carried out on "direct orders" from NATO commander General George Joulwan and Secretary General Javier Solana.</p>
<p>Bosnian Serb President Biljana Plavsic, in a protest to peacekeepers, claimed Drljaca was shot at home in front of his teenaged son and brother-in-law.</p>
<p>Prijedor police said Kovacevic was grabbed at gunpoint by four NATO soldiers who bluffed their way into his hospital.</p>
<p>British NATO troops are responsible for the Prijedor sector of northern Bosnia, where thousands of Moslems and Croats were driven from their homes by Drljaca's paramilitary units at the start of the war.</p>
<p>The region was notorious for detention camps such as Omarska and Keraterm, where Moslem and Croat men rounded up by Drljaca's force's were beaten, tortured and killed.</p>
<p>"Operation Tango" gave teeth to warnings by the U.S.-led allies who underwrote the Bosnian peace agreement that they were ready to get tougher with war crimes suspects.</p>
<p>Karadzic lives in the nationalist stronghold of Pale where any attempt to capture him would risk a battle with the heavy force of bodyguards who surround him round the clock.</p>
<p>Mladic is usually bunkered at the Bosnian Serb Army (BSA) headquarters at Han Pijesak in central Bosnia but was seen sauntering in a Belgrade shopping parade on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Plavsic demanded Kovacevic's release and told NATO commander General William Crouch in a letter that "I fear the reaction of the people will be terrible and I cannot bear any responsibility for this."</p>
<p>The Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA said Drljaca was the first victim on a secret NATO list to liquidate 40 prominent Serbs but did not give other names.</p>
<p>His killing caused tension in Prijedor which is on the frontline with the Moslem-Croat federation in Bosnian and almost fell to enemy forces in 1995, during the last stages of the war when the Serb military were on the run.</p>
<p>Peacekeeping officials were immediately worried about the danger of retaliaton against hundreds of international civilian staff and police in Bosnian Serb territory.</p>
<p>Drljaca was sacked as Prijedor police chief last autumn but was suspected of continuing to organise the obstruction of the peace process including the return of refugees.</p>
<p>A burly hardliner, he used to boast to journalists of his exploits in the early months of the war when a reign of terror gripped northern Bosnia.</p>
<p>Moslem families cowered in their homes as their menfolk were seized by armed Serb patrols in the streets of Prijedor and surrounding towns and villages.</p>
<p>The scenes of emaciated prisoners held behind barbed wire at Omarska shocked the world.</p>
<p>Drljaca claimed he was defending the West against Moslem fundamentalism and told one Reuter journalist: "What Europe has done is to cunningly put Serbs again in the position of defending it. See what a whore Europe is."</p>
<p>British Defence Secretary George Robertson told parliament that northern Bosnia was the "scene of some pretty horrifying war crimes and the action today was taken in the light of these accusations".</p>
