<p>Asian traders had mixed views over the near-term direction of copper and aluminium prices on Monday according to their positions on fundamental factors such as stock drawdowns.</p>
<p>"Looking at (copper) stocks may not be such a good indication of the market this week," said one metals trader, adding he did not expect much change in London Metal Exchange (LME) inventories.</p>
<p>Three-month LME copper closed at $2,487 a tonne at the afternoon kerb on Friday. (Corrects paragraph to remove reference to inter-office trading). </p>
<p>LME broker Brandeis said in its Friday review, that technical indicators showed early signs of an end to the massive drawdowns in exchange copper stocks.</p>
<p>Copper stocks were at 132,625 tonnes on Friday and traders in the region did not see levels changing drastically on Monday.</p>
<p>"Generally, I think copper is on its way up," said one Singapore-based trader.</p>
<p>Others disagreed and said copper could not sustain its current firm levels and they expected prices for the red metal to soften gradually and drop significantly by the second half of this year.</p>
<p>LME alumnium closed on Friday at $1,597 a tonne and according to Brandeis, it was difficult to get too bearish about the market in the face of the steady stock drawdowns over the past week.</p>
<p>LME alumnium stocks fell by 16,050 tonnes during the week, ending at 724,350 tonnes on Friday.</p>
<p>Some traders said that Asian demand, particularly in China, was strong and would boost aluminium prices and that market supplies were fairly tight.</p>
