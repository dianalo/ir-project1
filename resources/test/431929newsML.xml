<p>Several Taiwan shares, including sanitaryware maker Hocheng, surged at mid-morning on Monday in a move linked to probable speculative buying after lagging recent gains, brokers said.</p>
<p>With 75 minutes left, Hocheng rose by the daily seven percent limit to T$54.5, and electronics firm Systex was also limit up at the same T$54.5.</p>
<p>Brokers attributed the surge to their lagging recent gains.</p>
<p>"I cannot find specific reasons for their gains except that they lagged recent rallies," said Yuanta Securities analyst Henry Chen. "Overall, the index should enter into consolidation."</p>
