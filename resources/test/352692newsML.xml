<p>The bones of Burma's dead are getting in the way of efforts by the living to modernise their capital Rangoon.</p>
<p>As pile-drivers and cranes spearhead rapid commercial development, officials insist that graves have no place inside the city and are attempting to shift cemeteries to more tranquil surroundings in the outskirts.</p>
<p>As a result, residents have been scrambling to obey orders to dig up and remove their dead family members.</p>
<p>The issue is an emotional one, and city authorities have softened their stance, especially after looters took advantage of the situation to rob graves and poor Burmese pleaded for financial help to take their dead relatives away.</p>
<p>At Rangoon's oldest and largest cemetery of Kyan Daw, a deadline for relatives to exhume the remains of their beloved expired on January 31, but the Rangoon municipality has ruled that it will wait until no more claimants come before clearing the site.</p>
<p>"We will wait until there are no more relatives coming to exhume the remains of their dead before the cemetery is cleared and mass cremations of the unclaimed will be made," Maung Maung Oo, Yangon (Rangoon) City Development Committee (YCDC) supervisor at the graveyard, told Reuters.</p>
<p>The Kyan Daw cemetery houses 19,000 graves and so far about one third of them have been dug up and relocated.</p>
<p>"Every day, people are coming to exhume their dead," he said.</p>
<p>To encourage relatives to find a new resting place for their departed, the YCDC has offered free burial plots at a new cemetery about eight km (five miles) from the city centre.</p>
<p>Residents said there were rumours that the Kyan Daw cemetery might be developed into an entertainment centre by the former drugs warlord Khun Sa, who surrendered to Burma's ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) in January 1996.</p>
<p>Asked about the rumour a SLORC spokesman, Colonel Kyaw Thein, said: "You had better check with the ghosts. This is not true."</p>
<p>At the Kyan Daw cemetery, the order to remove the dead has meant a roaring trade for grave-diggers and coffin makers.</p>
<p>Graveyard workers said the entire process of exhuming, storing the bones in urns, making coffins and moving to the new site and erecting tombs could cost anywhere from 3,000 kyats (about $20) to 30,000 kyats.</p>
<p>Top-of-the-range teak coffins cost up to 10,000 kyats, the cemetery supervisor said.</p>
<p>Such prices are a heavy burden for the poor, who as a result tend to employ workers whose work is less than perfect. In several spots at the Kyan Daw cemetery, remnants of clothes worn by the dead lay strewn near graves.</p>
<p>But some residents in the area are happy with the cemetery's move. It means they will no longer have to endure the stench of bodies being cremated.</p>
