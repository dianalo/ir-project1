<p>Signalling a fresh start with his European Union partners, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, on Monday said he would work constructively on Europe's planned single currency.</p>
<p>Meeting EU monetary affairs commissioner Yves Thibault de Silguy ahead of an EU ministerial gathering, Brown "underlined his wish to work in a constructive manner on the euro," a spokesman for de Silguy told reporters.</p>
<p>Brown also offered details on his decision to give the Bank of England greater autonomy in setting monetary policy and discussed Europe's employment situation with de Silguy.</p>
<p>The spokesman noted that de Silguy viewed the decision on the Bank of England as a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>The meeting with EU finance ministers marked Brown's first outing on the European stage, an opportunity to make clear the new Labour government's position on a wide range of issues.</p>
<p>Many expect Britain to adopt a more cooperative approach towards Europe, this despite widespread public anxiety over joining a common currency.</p>
<p>Commenting on the Labour government's election victory, Luxembourg prime minister Jean Claude Juncker told reporters: "It is good news as far as the general atmosphere is concerned. It is more open-minded."</p>
<p>Although little change is anticipated from the ousted Tory government's stance on Europe's planned single currency, Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown is expected to argue for a cut in EU taxes on energy.</p>
<p>EU finance ministers will get an update on the European Commission's proposals to harmonise EU energy taxes with a view to extending taxation to all energy products by 2002.</p>
<p>Separately, the ministers endorsed new economic convergence plans by Spain and Portugal, two southern European states struggling to meet the Maastricht treaty's criteria for adopting the euro.</p>
<p>"The (Portuguese) plan was overwhelming applauded," said one EU diplomat.</p>
<p>The glowing appraisals for Spain and Portugal will contrast sharply with the expected assessment for Italy, a country still struggling under the weight of relatively high budget deficits.</p>
<p>Governments wishing to qualify for the euro must bring their 1997 budget deficits down to three percent of Gross Domestic Product. They must also demonstrate that outstanding public debt is approaching 60 percent of GDP at a satisfactory pace.</p>
<p>Incensed by a recent Commission forecast showing that its 1997 deficit would settle just above the Maastricht target, Italy is expected to receive a terse warning that it must do more to bring its public finances under control.</p>
<p>An Italian newspaper on Sunday said the warning to Italy, given to all governments with excessive deficits, would be "the most severe".</p>
<p>In a review of the fiscal situation across the 15-nation bloc, the ministers will also give Finland and the Netherlands high marks for their budget-slashing efforts.</p>
<p>Both countries will be taken off the list of governments with so-called excessive deficits, joining Luxembourg, Ireland and Denmark, the only countries currently in line with the Maastricht Treaty's requirements for deficits and debt.</p>
