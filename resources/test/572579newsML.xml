<title>FRANCE: French capital markets closing report.</title>

<p>Ten-year bond futures settled higher on Friday, shrugging off an opinion poll released on Thursday suggesting that the opposition Socialists were closing in on the ruling centre-right coalition in the French parliamentary race.</p>
<p>"Despite everything, the market still believes the right will end up winning," said one trader at a French brokerage.</p>
<p>Analysts said that the 10-year bond future could press higher at the start of the week, with an initial upside target for 130.0. Volume was a thin 40,787 contracts traded as many traders took the day off after Thursday's public holiday.  </p>
<p>The 10-year bond future traded in a small 20-point range, settling off its best levels. June PIBOR finished unchanged. The 10-year OAT-bund spread was steady at minus nine.</p>
<p>Some analysts were surprised at the lack of reaction to the IPSOS poll on Thursday showing that the rightist RPR/UDF coalition would get 290 seats in the National Assembly, just one more than is needed for a majority, the Socialists and their allies would win 264 and the Communists 22 for a total of 286, four short of the RPR-UDF tally.</p>
<p>"It's quite amazing that the market didn't react to the poll," said one analyst.  </p>
<p>"The market assumes, probably rightly, that even if the Socialists win, they will remain committed to monetary union," said Jean-Francois Mercier of Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>A win by the Socialists would trigger an initial big sell-off, economists reckon, but they predict the market would stabilise after it became clear that Socialist policy would not deviate much from that of the centre-right.</p>
<p>If opinion polls show no further erosion of the right's lead, the main focus next week would be a raft of U.S. data which will be the final batch before the U.S. FOMC meets on May 20, one analyst said.  </p>
<p>The U.S. data includes retail sales on Tuesday, producer prices on Wednesday, and jobless claims and consumer prices on Thursday.</p>
<p>Analysts said although there was not much price movement in PIBOR, investors were returning to the three-month interest rate future and there were a number a number of open positions.</p>
<p>"The reaction could be pretty violent either way depending on how the things (the election) turns out," said one dealer.</p>
<p>The two-round election takes place on May 25 and June 1.  </p>
<p>"Overall people are pretty positive, they just don't seem to believe in a win by the left -- and also the market is being helped by a very supportive international market," said a trader.</p>
<p>"There just are not too many sellers about, people don't take the risk of selling," said another.</p>
<p>The franc firmed slightly to 3.3729 per mark at the end of the day, up from 3.3740 on Thursday.</p>
