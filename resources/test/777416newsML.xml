<p>Listing of China Telecom (HK) Ltd in Hong Kong will not give foreign investors a controlling say in the domestic market and Beijing will retain control of the firm, the South China Morning Post reported on Monday.</p>
<p>"A foreigner buying some shares has no relation to the issue of operating in China," the newspaper quoted Posts and Telecommunications Minister Wu Jichuan as saying.</p>
<p>"A shareholder who purchases 10 million yuan worth of shares will not come to China saying that he wants to participate in management of operations," Wu was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>The paper said the listing would be the first opportunity for foreign investors to buy shares in mainland telecommunications firms.</p>
<p>The listing of China Telecom (HK) is a capital-raising exercise and will be a step forward in the reform of the mainland's telecommunications market, Wu said.</p>
<p>Currently, foreign investors are not allowed to operate or to have direct stakes in mainland telecommunications companies.</p>
<p>In June, China Telecom (HK)'s parent China Telecom had said the company was studying a listing for the Hong Kong subsidiary and a listing was expected in the near future.</p>
<p>Market sources had said the issue was expected to come on to the market by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>China Telecom, the operating arm of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, had earlier agreed to buy a 5.5 percent stake in HongKong Telecommunications Ltd from the Hong Kong firm's parent Cable &amp; Wireless Plc.</p>
