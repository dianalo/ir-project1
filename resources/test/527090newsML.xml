<p>Baldwin Piano &amp; Organ Co said Tuesday it had cut 78 manufacturing jobs at its plants in Conway and Trumann Ark., Greenwood, Miss., and Juarez, Mexico, representing a reduction of nearly eight percent of the workforce at the four plants.</p>
<p>The company said the cuts should bring 1997 savings of about $1 million dollars, net of severance costs, with even greater savings in future years.</p>
<p>Nearly all the eliminated jobs were hourly jobs, and no special charges are anticipated, the company said.</p>
<p>"We are making tremendous strides in streamlining our manufacturing processes, and the implementation of synchronous manufacturing is a key element of this initiative," the company said.</p>
