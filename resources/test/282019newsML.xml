<p>President Suharto said on Tuesday that Indonesia's economy was expected to grow by around 7.8 percent in 1996, compared with 8.2 percent in 1995.</p>
<p>He said in his year-end message to the nation that inflation was expected to be around 6.7 percent, against 8.6 percent in 1995.  </p>
<p>"We have achieved various important advances in the economic field. Economic growth this year remained high, around 7.8 percent, (but) a bit slower when compared with 8.2 percent in 1995," Suharto said.</p>
<p>"We can contain inflation to around 6.7 percent, lower than last year's inflation of 8.6 percent," he said.</p>
<p>He said the economy was stable although there was a current account deficit.</p>
<p>"The improvement in the economic field has brought positive impacts on other development sectors. However, we are aware that there are weaknesses and shortcomings that we must overcome.</p>
<p>"We must overcome the development gap between sectors, regions or economic groups. We must overcome this by accelerating equitability in all fields," Suharto said.</p>
<p>He said the government would continue with programmes to eradicate poverty and develop small and medium businesses through partnerships and other measures.</p>
<p>He said Indonesia should strengthen the competitiveness of its goods and services in 1997, both in the domestic and world markets.</p>
