<p>U.S. stocks closed sharply higher on Wednesday after comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan eased fears the central bank might be planning an interest rate increase to slow the stock market's runup.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials jumped 93 points to close unofficially at 6946. Most of the rally occurred as Greenspan testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Banking Subcommittee.</p>
<p>In his comments today, Greenspan, who last week issued several unusually blunt warnings regarding stock prices during his Senate appearance, appeared to soften his tone.  </p>
<p>"We don't view monetary policy as a tool to ... prick the stock market bubble, or something like that," he said.</p>
<p>He also repeated an assertion that the stock market was "properly priced" if Wall Street's assumptions about corporate profit growth proved correct.</p>
<p>The comments stood in contrast to last week, when Greenspan's testimony was peppered with reflections on speculative bubbles in the stock market. His testimony triggered an almost uninterrupted decline in stocks that pulled the Dow industrials down by about 185 points in a week.  </p>
<p>However, as he has often done in the past, Greenspan used the second session of his semi-annual report on the economy to Congress to ease his tone and markets responded with a bounce.</p>
<p>"He did gingerly take a step back," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First Albany. "He helped us get over our jitters and I think almost everybody is issuing a sigh of relief."</p>
<p>But even amid the strongest and broadest rally by stocks in three weeks, analysts cautioned that the debate on interest rates was far from over and a critical test still lay ahead with Friday's monthly payroll and wage report.  </p>
<p>"It's all going to boil down to Friday being a pivotal day," said Bill Meehan, market analyst at Prudential Securities. "Unfortunately, no one can tell us what's going to happen then."</p>
<p>Analysts widely believe a very strong report Friday could prompt Greenspan to begin raising interest rates to stem inflation pressures before they make their way to prices.</p>
<p>But today, investors focused on the present, and as tension waned and stocks turned sharply higher, the market appeared to reassume the characteristics that have served as trademarks of the most recent stage of the bull market.  </p>
<p>"We remain in an extremely volatile market where the first tier names continue to dominate," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. "Corrections, when they occur in the broad indices, are very short-lived and then we're off to the races again."</p>
<p>Drug stocks showed signs of resuming their market leadership, with several major pharmaceutical companies posting sharp gains on the session. Merck and Co Inc rose 3-1/4 to 94 and Pfizer Inc added 3-5/8 to 93-3/4.</p>
<p>Semiconductor shares were also sharply higher, after an influential analyst made bullish comments on the sector.  </p>
<p>The analyst, Thomas Kurlak of Merrill Lynch, said he believed a price correction in semiconductor stocks was near an end. He also said consensus earnings estimates for two major companies in the sector, Intel Corp and Micron Technology Inc, were too low.</p>
<p>Shares in Intel responded by jumping 3-1/8 to 149-1/2 and Micron gained 2-1/2 to 42-3/8. Others in the group also rose, such as Cypress Semiconductor Corp, up one to 14-3/8, and National Semiconductor Corp, up 2-1/4 to 30-3/4.</p>
<p>Retailers were also firm, after several companies reported strong sales and earnings.  </p>
<p>Dollar General Corp climbed 2-1/4 to 31 after reporting February same-store sales rose 11 percent versus a year ago. Kmart Corp added 1/8 to 13 after releasing its strongest operating results in four years.</p>
<p>Unison Software Inc slid 8-1/8 to 6-1/4 after warning its third quarter results would be below Wall Street estimates. Corporate Express Inc met a similar fate, sliding 8-3/16 to 10-1/8 after warning its fourth quarter results would be below estimates.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index rose 11.04 points to 801.99.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite rose 11.72 points to 1329.09.</p>
