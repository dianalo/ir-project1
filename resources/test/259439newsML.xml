<headline>BEFORE THE BELL - Boeing, McDonnell surge.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1996-12-16</dateline>

<p>Shares of Boeing Co and McDonnell Douglas Corp jumped in the U.S. pre-open after the two companies agreed to merge in a $13.3 billion deal that would create the world's largest commercial jet maker.</p>
<p>Boeing surged to 103-1/2 from Friday's 96-3/4 close while McDonnell traded at 65-1/8 from Friday's 52 finish, traders said. They said Lockheed Martin Corp was not trading in the pre-open. That stock ended at 86 on Friday.  </p>
<p>The deal, which was announced on Sunday, came less that a year after previous merger talks between Boeing and McDonnell had fallen apart.</p>
<p>"They had talked awhile ago but people thought it was over and done with," said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders saw no activity in the pre-open with Continental Airlines Inc shares, but expected a weaker start. Continental chairman Gordon Bethune told employees in a telephone message taped Friday that the company was no longer holding discussions with any airlines.  </p>
<p>The executive did not mention Delta Air Lines Inc which was rumored to have been in exploratory merger talks with Continental. Traders also saw no trading in the pre-open for Delta.</p>
<p>Continental class B shares ended Friday at 27-5/8.</p>
