<p>CME live cattle futures were called 0.10 to 0.20 cent per lb lower at the opening and feeder cattle steady to 0.10 cent lower, analysts said.</p>
<p>Analysts doubt there will be follow-through buying from the late gains in Wednesday's trading.</p>
<p>"There was nothing (fundamental) to substantiate it," said one analyst of the late gains.</p>
<p>Another analyst said "the cash news continues on the negative side. If we establish a cash (cattle) market it will be lower."</p>
<p>A few cattle traded Wednesday at $65.00 per cwt, down $1.00 from light $66.00 trades Tuesday and late last week.</p>
<p>Also, USDA reported beef cutout values continued to slide. Cutout values late Wednesday were down $1.01 to $0.42 per cwt, which followed declines Tuesday and Friday.  </p>
<p>Feeder cattle were expected steady to 0.10 cent per lb lower at the opening on follow-through selling from Wednesday's lower close. Analysts said the long-term uptrend in feeder cattle may over.</p>
<p>The latest CME feeder cattle weighted average was $77.45 per cwt, down $0.15 from the previous one.</p>
