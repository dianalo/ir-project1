<p>The dollar lost some steam on Monday after world financial leaders surprised the markets by agreeing that the currency's strong rise should come to an end.</p>
<p>The dollar stood at around 122.40 yen by Tokyo noon after falling sharply in early Asian trading to just over the key 120 yen level. It had closed in New York at 123.10 yen on Friday.</p>
<p>It was also trading at 1.6460 German marks, down sharply from 1.6610 Friday in New York.</p>
<p>"The market did not anticipate the comments saying that the reversal of the dollar had ended," said Takashi Kanagami, deputy general manager at Mitsubishi Trust and Banking.</p>
<p>"The agreement, which might have been intended to stabilise the dollar/yen rate at 120 to 125 yen, may have the effect of checking the dollar's rise," he added.</p>
<p>The markets showed little reaction to Japanese trade figures released early Monday. The figures showed a 31 percent year-on-year fall last year in the the current account, which measures trade in goods and services.</p>
<p>In a statement released after a meeting on Saturday, the Group of Seven (G7) nations -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States -- signalled their desire for stability in the foreign exchange markets by saying that their currencies were no longer misaligned in a major way.</p>
<p>The accord was good news for Japan, which has grown increasingly worried about the dollar's sharp climb against the yen.</p>
<p>Market watchers also said they had detected a subtle change in U.S. currency policy.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, who had for months said that a strong dollar was in America's interests, said on Friday that the dollar has been strong "for some time now".</p>
<p>"The market is becoming sceptical about the U.S. strong dollar policy after Rubin's remarks," said Ryohei Muramatsu, manager of treasury and foreign exchange at Commerzbank.</p>
<p>Wataru Ito, deputy general manager at Sanwa Bank Ltd, said the United Sates had set several conditions on Japan in return for its endorsement of current exchange rates.</p>
<p>The United States voiced concern on Saturday over Japan's fragile economy and banking system and said it would keep close watch on developments there for potential fallout on the rest of the world.</p>
<p>"If Japan fails to carry out various reforms in its budget, stock market and tax system smoothly, there may be the risk that the yen will be sold further," Ito said.</p>
<p>Tokyo stocks finished the Monday morning session broadly firmer after paring most of their earlier gains due to weakness in the banking and construction sectors.</p>
<p>At midday, the key 225-share Nikkei average was up 27.45 points, or 0.15 percent, at 17,894.49. Nikkei March futures were 20 points higher at 17,880.</p>
