<p>When U.S. astronaut David Wolf simulated a three-hour spacewalk on Monday, he tore his glove while working on an underwater model of the Mir space station.</p>
<p>In space that could be fatal.</p>
<p>Up on Mir, the crew will put on their spacesuits for real later this week to attempt repairs inside the space station's damaged Spektr module that will test the limits of their ability.</p>
<p>The job, originally planned for Wednesday, was delayed by two or three days on Monday after the crew suffered another computer failure, sending the ship spinning chaotically in orbit.</p>
<p>"It's quite do-able and will take all the talent that these individuals have," Wolf, 40, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>During the repairs, engineer Pavel Vinogradov, with the help  of commander Anatoly Solovyov, will enter a small module called the node before opening the hatch to the Spektr, which was punctured during Mir's June 25 collision with its resupply ship.</p>
<p>They will then try to connect power cables into Spektr to tap energy from solar panels which have been off since the June accident. They will then reseal Spektr from the rest of Mir.</p>
<p>Wolf, who is scheduled to replace NASA physicist Michael Foale on Mir in late September, has been training at the Star City cosmonaut centre outside Moscow on making spacewalks.</p>
<p>On Monday, dressed in the Russian Orlan spacesuit, Wolf slowly worked his way along various Mir modules on the bottom of a 20-metre deep pool, a simulation that has helped him understand the difficulties of the Mir repairs.</p>
<p>The challenges will begin as soon as the two cosmonauts enter the node outside the Spektr's hatch, an area the size of a small car's interior, he said.</p>
<p>"It's a tight fit and in a pressurised suit you're not very flexible," he said in an interview. "But it (the node) has a lot of equipment in it, electrical cables and valves and handles. It's not a smooth interior, and you don't want to be knocking around. The visibility in the helmet is limited."</p>
<p>"To connect the electrical connectors with the glove hands -- these connectors were not designed to be handled that way and that will be a challenge," said Wolf, who is a medical doctor as well as research scientist.</p>
<p>If anything punctures a spacesuit, instant death is likely.</p>
<p>Repressurising the node after they connect the cables will also be tricky.</p>
<p>"If there should be a leak, a reason that it can't be repressurised...To my mind, that would lead to an evacuation," he said.</p>
<p>Wolf is not at present scheduled to participate in the second stage of repairs planned for September to patch the hole in Spektr, but he said NASA was considering the possibility.</p>
<p>"It would be an honour if they would ask me to do that and I  want to help all I can," he said. "NASA is examining that as one of the options. It's undecided, but inspection and repair are on the list of areas to be trained in prior to the flight."</p>
<p>The improvised nature of the life on Mir space station is apparent even from the Star City pool side, where a bucket caught leaking water from one of the cables leading to Wolf's spacesuit. The crushed body of a small mouse was nearby.</p>
<p>"I'm not worried," Wolf, a competition aerobatics pilot in his spare time, said of his mission. "Essentially I like operating in critical situations."</p>
<p>He also said the United States should steadfastly back the Mir programme despite its many woes because it provided valuable training for the future international space station.</p>
<p>"It just to me seems ludicrous to bale out just because things aren't going as smooth as we'd like them," he said.</p>
<p>"What we have here is an incredible opportunity to look into  the crystal ball at how our station will be in eight, 10, 12 years into its life span," he said.</p>
<p>"And everything we see happening in the Mir system is something we still have time to design around, upgrade around, or alter procedures to prevent."</p>
