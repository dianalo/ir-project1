<p>Belgian diversified shipping group CMB NV said on Friday it declined comment on a French newspaper report that it had joined hands with French Bollore group to take over French ports company Saga.</p>
<p>The report in Le Figaro newspaper, published in Belgian newspapers on Friday, said CMB and Bollore wanted to inject 125 million French francs into ailing Saga and were aiming to take a 58 percent stake in Saga.</p>
<p>It said Saga's board had already approved the rescue plan but the plan still needed the blessing of banks to which Saga owed more than one billion French francs.</p>
