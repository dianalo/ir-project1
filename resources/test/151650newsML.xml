<p>Japan announced a mixed batch of indicators on its economy Tuesday, with industrial output showing surprising growth in September, but the jobless rate staying stubbornly high.</p>
<p>Industrial production in September increased a preliminary 1.0 percent from the previous month on a seasonally adjusted basis, confirming that output was on a gradual upward trend, official data showed.</p>
<p>Industrial production was also expected to rise 2.6 percent in the October to December period from the previous quarter, which translates into a year-on-year rise of 4.2 percent, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry said.</p>
<p>"They are extremely encouraging. We were at the top end of the range, looking at 0.5 percent growth month-on-month. They beat our expectations," said Jason James, a strategist at James Capel in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Increased production of cars, tankers and general machinery contributed to the month-on-month rise in September. Inventory build-ups, which have been a worrisome factor, showed sure signs of improvement, an MITI official told reporters.</p>
<p>"The figures were very strong, basically, as expected, because the economy is recovering fairly significantly and that means that production is also recovering," said Richard Werner, chief economist at Jardine Fleming Securities.</p>
<p>"We have a full-blown economic recovery," he said.</p>
<p>But the unemployment rate was steady at 3.3 percent in September, unchanged from August and just a shade below the record 3.5 percent seen in the summer, according to official figures released Tuesday.</p>
<p>Although Japan does not have the double-digit jobless rates of some Western countries, the climb in the rate over the past year has caused concern in a nation that has had minimal unemployment for most of the postwar era.</p>
<p>The government said that although the rate stayed stubbornly high, there was a silver lining in the statistics that suggested growing economic confidence and job mobility.</p>
<p>The figures showed that a record number of workers had voluntarily quit their jobs in September -- a total of 930,000, up 30,000 from a year earlier.</p>
<p>"Overall, we see an improving economy as a possible cause of the rise in people leaving their jobs voluntarily," a government official said. He cautioned that it was too early to tell if unemployment did actually peak in May and June, when the rate was 3.5 percent.</p>
<p>Jardine Fleming's Werner said that part-time women workers who re-entered the job market by registering to look for jobs kept the unemployment figure high, despite the economic recovery.</p>
<p>"Many of the recent indicators are showing brighter signs of economic recovery," said Yukio Yambe, an economist at DKB Research Institute Corp.</p>
<p>But other analysts were cautious, as there have been signs recently of lingering sluggishness in the economy.</p>
<p>Many economists predict the economic recovery will slow in the coming months, with a fall in public works spending, and especially after a planned rise in the consumption tax next April to 5 percent from the current 3 percent.</p>
