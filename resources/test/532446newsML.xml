<p>Venezuelan start-up Santa Barbara Airlines plans to add cargo capabilities to its business mix, its chief executive told Reuters this week.</p>
<p>"We will eventually get a dedicated cargo aircraft -- maybe shared with others --  sometime after the end of our first twelve months of operation," Frans Kramer, general manager and chief executive of the 23 day-old Maracaibo airline, said.  Santa Barbara is one of the many new airlines in Latin America flying small jets within the region.</p>
<p>They primarily serve smaller markets.  </p>
<p>As the region opens its skies to others within the area, analysts are predicting big growth for these tiny regionals.</p>
<p>"Within the entire region, there is a potential for developing long, skinny routes which have no air service at present and which can profitably support daily service with the small jets," Robert Booth, a consultant with Aviation Management Services, wrote in a recent position paper.</p>
<p>Kramer feels the smaller markets are also ripe for cargo service.  "We have already had requests to fly machinery and whatever else," he said, "but with our 48-seat aircraft our cargo capability is limited."  </p>
<p>"Some routes may be more active in cargo than passenger," he said.</p>
<p>Santa Barbara will first do courrier service, he said.</p>
<p>The airline has one jet and will take delivery on another next month, Kramer said.</p>
<p>"Right now, our business plan is, we need to focus on transporting passengers," he said.</p>
