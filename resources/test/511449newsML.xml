<p>June notionnel futures on MATIF will target the top of the recent range at 128.80 on Tuesday after a robust opening, technical analysts said.</p>
<p>"It's looking a little bit stonger the way it is picking up here," said Simon Mattholie, proprietary trader at Deutsche Bank in London. "The 128.80 high from April 9 may be attainable."</p>
<p>June notionnel futures were quoted up 0.24 at 128.50 at 0756 GMT, having pierced initial resistance from the recent highs at 128.58 and 128.56 in early dealings.</p>
<p>Above the 128.80 high, trendline resistance intervenes at 128.82 and 129.02, technical analysts at Chase in London said.  </p>
<p>The analysts at Chase said in a research note the market would fail at this trendline resistance and turn south again for a decline to the 127.73 level.</p>
<p>The market put in several highs and lows around this area recently, including a 127.72 high on April 2 and two 127.74 lows at the end of March.</p>
<p>Also to the downside, Mattholie saw minor trendline support on hourly charts at 128.28 and a stronger buffer at the April 14 low of 128.04.</p>
<p>At the short end, June Pibor futures were quoted at 96.68, up two basis points from Monday's settlement.  </p>
<p>Richard Adcock, manager of technical research at HSBC Futrues in London, said Pibor had been able to breach supply at 96.65 to open the way for further gains over the short term.</p>
<p>"We stress however, that the upside has taken prices further into overbought readings, as measured by stochastics, which have now turned down to give a sell signal," he said in a note.</p>
<p>The market would correct back to 96.60, he said. Daily charts show this as the bottom of the previous range before the market pushed up again.</p>
