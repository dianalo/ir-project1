<p>The Ontario Securities Commission on Friday released its decision on Ventra Group Inc's application for orders relating to Tarxien Corp's use of a shareholder rights plan to fend off Ventra's unsolicited takeover offer.</p>
<p>A panel of the Ontario Securities Commission has decided to bar trade of securities issued, or to be issued, under Tarxien's shareholder rights plan which was adopted by the board on October 25. The OSC also said the registration and prospectus exemptions under Ontario law do not apply to shares issued under the Tarxien rights plan.  </p>
<p>Tarxien has received a C$14.50 per share takeover offer from privately held PaintPlas Acquisition Corp and a C$14.10 a share bid from Gecamex Technologies Inc.</p>
<p>Ventra raised its bid to C$9.25 per share in cash and two Ventra common shares, plus one warrant and the right to an additional C$0.95 cash or an extra half Ventra share.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Tarxien said its board would not recommend acceptance of a takeover offer from Gecamex because of the higher offer from PaintPlas.</p>
