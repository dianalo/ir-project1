<p>URS Corp has signed a definitive agreement to buy privately owned Woodward-Clyde Group Inc for $100 million in stock and cash, the two engineering companies said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Terms of the deal call for Denver-based Woodward-Clyde stockholders to receive $65 million of URS common stock plus $35 million cash, they said.</p>
<p>The acquisition, scheduled to close in November, is not expected to have a material impact on URS fiscal 1998 earnings, they said.  </p>
<p>The companies said the proposed combination will create the fifth largest U.S. engineering firm, with revenues of $800 million and more than 6,000 employees.</p>
<p>The transaction is subject to the approval by stockholders of both companies as well as regulatory and other approvals, they said.</p>
<p>"Domestically, the combination balances the geographic distribution of resources to create a dynamic national firm with the ability to provide a full range of services anywhere in the country," URS Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Martin Koffel said.</p>
<p>"Our combined revenue base will escalate URS into one of the leading engineering firms and further enhance our opportunities to win large, high-profile contracts," he said.</p>
<p>The companies said it is expected that Woodward-Clyde President and Chief Executive Officer Jean-Yves Perez and Chairman Frank Waller will join the URS board.</p>
