<title>USA: U.S. January industrial output flattens out.</title>

<p>Production by the nation's mines, factories and utilities flattened out in January after rising strongly in the final months of last year, the Federal Reserve said on Friday.</p>
<p>Industrial output was unchanged last month after climbing by a revised 0.5 percent in December and by 0.8 percent in November, the U.S. central bank said.</p>
<p>The leveling off in output further reduces inflation pressures on the economy amid other reports that prices at the wholesale level actually declined in January.  </p>
<p>"The production index for business equipment rose further in January, but the indexes for consumer goods and for materials were little changed," the Fed said. "The output of construction supplies fell for a second month."</p>
<p>Earlier on Friday the Labour Department reported that producer prices dropped in January by 0.3 percent -- the first decline October 1994.</p>
<p>The Fed said that industry was running at 83.3 percent of its maximum capacity in January, down from 83.5 percent in December.</p>
<p>That was the lowest operating level since 83 percent in October -- and well under the 85 percent rate that many economists say poses a potential risk for fanning inflation.</p>
<p>Analysts said industrial output during January might have been curtailed by severe winter weather in parts of the country and emphasised that the leveling off in production was not a worrisome sign for national economic activity.</p>
<p>"It doesn't point to a downturn but rather an inflection point," said Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. "The economy seems to have peaked out in terms of growth rate in November.</p>
<p>"We saw it in housing, construction, retail sales and now industrial production," Ricchiuto added.</p>
<p>Manufacturing output fell by 0.2 percent during January after a 0.7 percent jump in December.</p>
<p>The only major industry group that posted a big production increase in January was utilities, up 2.9 percent. The Fed said that was because cold weather boosted electricty demand for heating.</p>
<p>The increase was was a rebound from December, when utilities output dropped 2.9 percent.</p>
<p>Mining industries recorded a 0.7 percent decline in their production following a 1.4 percent rise in December.</p>
