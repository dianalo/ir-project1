<p>The Pakistan Sugar Mills Association said on Wednesday sugar production had reached 655,279 tonnes by December 31, compared with 1.006 million tonnes a year earlier.</p>
<p>One dealer said the cane crushing season had begun later than usual -- in November rather than October -- to enable mills to get a higher yield from the cane.</p>
<p>Pakistan is still expected to produce 2.65 million tonnes of sugar in 1996/97 (July-June), compared with 2.47 million in 1995/96 and 3.0 million in 1994/95.</p>
<p>The immediate shortfall prompted the state-run Trading Corporation of Pakistan to buy 50,000 tonnes of sugar from neighbouring India in the last week of December.</p>
