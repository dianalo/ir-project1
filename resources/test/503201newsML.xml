<p>Members of German Finance Minister Theo Waigel's Christian Social Union on Friday insisted the party agreed on a tough interpretation of the fiscal entry criteria to Europe's planned currency union.</p>
<p>Asked about speculation that his party had fallen into bitter infighting as Germany scrambled to ready itself for currency union, Waigel said: "The CSU has closed ranks and will appear united at today's party meeting."</p>
<p>Joachim Herrmann, the party's newly appointed deputy general secretary, said: "As far as I know there are no disagreements between (Bavarian state premier Edmund) Stoiber and Waigel."</p>
<p>Asked about speculation earlier this week that Waigel had distanced himself from his hardline interpretation of budget deficit criterion, Herrmann said: "In our policy draft we say that new indebtedness may not as a rule exceed 3%, and that means 3.0 and that is it."</p>
