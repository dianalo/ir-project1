<headline>New Jersey Court rules that clergy can be sued.</headline>

<p>- The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that when a member of the clergy violates his relationship with someone seeking counsel, the injured party can sue.</p>
<p>Voting 5-2 in the case of an Episcopal priest, the state's highest court said, however, that applying the same malpractice standard applied to doctors, lawyers, therapists or psychologists risked violating the First Amendment protection of religion.</p>
<p>That's because to find malpractice, a court would have to rule on what is standard practice in religion.</p>
<p>"The entanglement would restrain the free exercise of religion," Justice Stewart Pollock wrote for the majority.</p>
<p>That ruling reversed an appeals court finding that the suit could proceed on malpractice grounds.</p>
<p>The high court ruled that a North Jersey woman identified only by her initials, F.G., could sue the Rev. Alex MacDonnell on the more limited grounds.</p>
<p>She charged that while she sought counselling from the priest at All Saints Episcopal Church in Bergenfield, N.J., he engaged in sexually intimate relations short of intercourse.</p>
<p>She needed psychiatric care afterward, her lawsuit said.</p>
