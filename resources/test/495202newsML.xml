<p>New Zealand's coalition government faced a revolt in its ranks on Tuesday over a plan to introduce compulsory superannuation savings that could undermine its wafer thin majority.</p>
<p>A referendum on compulsory savings for retirement will be held in September, and the government has pledged to back the scheme if there is a 'yes' vote, whatever the voter turnout.</p>
<p>But a group of backbench government MPs, some unhappy with the concept of compulsion and some unwilling to implement the scheme if there is a low turnout in the postal ballot, have made a clear threat to vote against the legislation.</p>
<p>"If there is a turnout under 50 percent, I will consider it is not a mandate from the public," Waipareira MP Brian Neeson told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>"I am not going to bring (compulsory) super into this country with, say, 20 percent of the population voting it in."</p>
<p>The coalition deal struck last December between the conservative National Party and the nationalist New Zealand First Party bound government MPs to support the result of the referendum, although individuals were free to argue for or against it before the vote.  </p>
<p>The government has 61 seats in the 120-member single-chamber parliament.</p>
<p>Neeson said more than half of the National Party caucus felt as he did but he would not guess how many might cross the floor.</p>
<p>At least three other MPs have either said they will vote against the legislation or have refused to confirm their support for it, and the number is growing.</p>
<p>"There are likely to be six by the end of the month," a government source told Reuters.</p>
<p>Compulsory superannuation was a key plank of Treasurer Winston Peters's New Zealand First, and he sees it as a way to improve New Zealand's savings ratio.</p>
<p>But the concept is opposed by many National MPs.</p>
<p>National leader and Prime Minister Jim Bolger has said he backs changes to the current universal taxpayer funded scheme and would support "the right" compulsory scheme.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Bolger told Reuters on Tuesday the rebel MPs were free to express their views, and the question of their crossing the floor over the legislation "was a hurdle we will jump when we come to it".  </p>
<p>"The prime minister expects every member of his caucus will abide by the commitment to the coalition agreement when the time comes," the spokesman added.</p>
<p>The exact design of the proposed scheme has yet to be finalised, but it should take into account New Zealand First's policy that would eventually see eight percent of income diverted into pension savings.</p>
<p>Compensatory tax cuts are also planned, although not guaranteed. If approved, the scheme would come into force in July 1998.</p>
<p>Parliament's electoral law select committee, which will review the legislation setting up the referendum, is likely to rewrite the question asked at the referendum.</p>
<p>Draft legislation would see the referendum ask voters: "Are you for or against the retirement savings scheme?"</p>
<p>But opposition Labour Party finance spokesman Michael Cullen complained on Tuesday that this did not even mention the word "compulsory" and should be changed.</p>
<p>Select committee member National MP Tony Ryall backed this view saying, "I think the committee has to change the words. It is not neutral. Parliament does not want to be accused of loading the question one way or the other."</p>
