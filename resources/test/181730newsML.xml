<p>Even after suffering one of the worst defeats in World Cup history, life quickly went back to normal for Liechtenstein's part-time soccer players.</p>
<p>On Monday, Harry Zech was at his job as a winemaker and his midfield partner Roland Hilti was back in his role as a scholl-teacher while defender Patrik Hefti was back delivering the mail.</p>
<p>Forward Ralf Oehri, who missed Liechtenstein's previous match with Lithuania because he couldn't get time away from a new job, was back in the bakery and in fact, everyone was back in their day-jobs including Dietrich Weise.</p>
<p>But Weise's day-job is a little different from most of the others as he is Liechtenstein's first and only full-time soccer coach. Or he has been up until now.</p>
<p>For even before Saturday's 11-1 loss to Macedonia --  the joint-fourth highest defeat in the World Cup's 66-year-history -- Weise said he would soon be leaving to take up a job in Germany.</p>
<p>"In Liechtenstein I have learned about success but in this match I know failure," said Weise, who coached at Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1980s and was with the Egyptian national team from 1991-1993.</p>
<p>"In Liechtenstein we have only amateurs.</p>
<p>"First there is work and after that is done then only can we have training."</p>
<p>Living with crushing defeat is not a new experience for the players from this tiny alpine nation of 30,000 sandwiched between Switzerland and Austria.</p>
<p>Since making their international debut in 1981, Liechtenstein, whose seven clubs compete in the lower divisions of the Swiss League, have known only minimal success.</p>
<p>They actually won three friendly matches in succession in 1981 and 1982 -- against Indonesia, Malaysia and astonishingly China. But from the early 1980s -- apart from one match against Austria in 1984 -- they  did not play international soccer again until 1990 when the United States beat them 4-1 in a friendly in Eschen.</p>
<p>Their first competitive match was on April 20, 1994 when they lost 4-1 to Northern Ireland in Belfast in a European championship qualifier and since then their record has made frightening reading.</p>
<p>Consistently hammered by some of the best, and not so best in Europe, they have played 14 matches since 1994, winning none, drawing one and losing 13. The goals column is equally depressing: for: three; against 60.</p>
<p>The high point came on June 3, 1995 when Liechtenstein held the Republic of Ireland to a 0-0 draw in Eschen -- a result which eventually cost the Republic a place in this summer's Euro 96 finals in England.</p>
<p>But even though the players might have resigned themselves to the drubbings, it's clear that local soccer fans have little desire to come and see their compatriots get hammered.</p>
<p>Despite it being the only game in town on Saturday, only 2,900 turned out in sunny and unseasonably warm November weather for the game with Macedonia.</p>
<p>Before the game, traffic around the capital of Vaduz was snarled but the cars were headed for the markets and not the ground. Horns blared not with supporters but with angry shoppers anxious to find somewhere to park.</p>
<p>While the match -- or rather the one-sided soccer exhibition was being played out -- goods were bought in the market, prices were haggled over.</p>
<p>Unless you were in the stadium it was easy to forget the match was even taking place. An hour after the game finished and the Macedonians had piled into their buses for the start of their long trip home, the little ground was deserted.</p>
<p>"Actually it's sad that people don't care that much about the national team," said Weise.</p>
<p>"Now the novelty is over they have to win to be accepted. And Liechtenstein has a new team, there is no tradition."</p>
<p>They also have no stadium, only a small ground without floodlights and a small stand for 200 people.</p>
<p>But Ernst Nigg, president of the Liechtenstein Football Association believes, just like Kevin Costner in the movies, that if he builds one, they will come.</p>
<p>His Field of Dreams is a 6,000 all-seater, floodlit stadium in Vaduz which scheduled to begin construction next year.</p>
<p>"When we have a new stadium we won't have to play in the afternoon," said Nigg, adding that FIFA and UEFA have both insisted on a new facility if Liechtenstein wants to continue to compete internationally.</p>
<p>"If we could play at night I believe more people would come."</p>
<p>For the Liechtenstein players, the goal each time they step onto the field is always the same.</p>
<p>"Our game plan is to play defencively for as long as possible ato try and keep the score 0-0," explained Hefti. "Then play minute-to-minute and hope the other team starts to get worried and makes a mistake."</p>
<p>"You step on the field against some of the big teams and you wonder, what are you doing here. You get nervous but there is no fear.</p>
<p>"Each game we just want to prove the difference between us and them is not so great."</p>
<p>The next test comes in March when Liechtenstein travel to Romania, who are regarded as far more formidable opponents than Macedonia.</p>
<p>Following Saturday's crushing defeat, just keeping the score down to single figures in Bucharest might well be seen as a success in itself.</p>
