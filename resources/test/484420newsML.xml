<p>China on Thursday blamed Taiwan for creating obstacles to direct shipping links, despite signs that the first commercial sailings across the Taiwan Strait for nearly five decades could be imminent.</p>
<p>Taiwan transport Vice Minister Mao Chi-kuo said on Thursday direct sailings could take place within 10 days, now that Beijing has approved five mainland shipping firms to pioneer services between the mainland and its island arch-rival.</p>
<p>"We always stand for accelerating direct shipping links between the two sides, but Taiwan has set up obstacles," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang.</p>
<p>"Particularly in recent times, Taiwan authorities have taken a very passive attitude to direct shipping links and economic and trade cooperation," Shen told a news briefing in Beijing.</p>
<p>China's Ministry of Communications said on Wednesday that Beijing had cleared five shipping companies, including major national line China Ocean Shipping, to begin limited direct shipping services to Taiwan.</p>
<p>All must still receive formal approval from Taiwan, but Taiwan's transportation ministry said it expected to receive applications from the newly authorised Chinese firms within a few days and would approve them swiftly.</p>
<p>"The ministry will be able to process the mainland shippers for cross-strait links in less than a week after receiving them," transport Vice Minister Mao told reporters.</p>
<p>Taiwan has banned direct air and shipping links with China since defeated Nationalist armies took refuge on the island at the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949.</p>
<p>Taipei allows indirect links through Hong Kong or elsewhere but has come under increasing pressure to permit direct shipping and air links from its own businessmen and from Beijing.</p>
