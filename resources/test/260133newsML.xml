<text>
<p>With it all now said and done, the budget has had a remarkable escape in the upper house of parliament, thanks to Labor defector Mal Colston, who by chance chose this year to become an independent.</p>
<p>Canberra Watch estimates the total loss of fiscal measures in the Senate at A$300 million to A$400 million (1997/98 full-year values) out of a total budget tightening of A$7.2 billion.</p>
<p>That is, the tightening must now be something like A$6.8 billion, cutting the 1997/98 underlying deficit from the A$8.7 billion starting point seen in August to around A$2 billion.</p>
<p>Parameter changes (lower inflation, higher unemployment) will no doubt change that estimate when the mid-year review is issued in early January, but that's the situation on the basis of the August forecasts.</p>
<p>The more up-to-date Access Economics forecasts would come up with a more attractive number: a A$1.4 billion underlying deficit in 1997/98.</p>
<p>Government officials are putting around the off-the-record line that they have got off scot-free in the Senate.</p>
<p>Why? Because if their aim is to manage expectations, the image of a better-than-expected result implies that one need not expect further budget tightening next year.</p>
<p>But although the government has a motive for saying that they did better than expected, it is probably true anyway. No one would have been game to count on Colston and the other independent, Brian Harradine, delivering so much of the budget.</p>
<p>Finally, here is a final detailed budget update for 1996. Note that there are still some bills classified as pending, and that one of those listed as a loss, the immigrant's social security measure, may be resurrected when it is presented to the Senate again next year.</p>
<p>---LOSSES TO DATE---</p>
<p>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL, 1996 and SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL, 1996</p>
<p>These bills passed the Senate on Friday evening. Various measures, described below, were in doubt and the Senate knocked some off. The value was described as A$400 million over four years, which probably translate into a little over A$100 million in 1997/98</p>
<p>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO.3), 1996</p>
<p>The Senate amended this bill on Thursday.</p>
<p>-- Partnerships' R&amp;D. The government wanted to end all syndication for R&amp;D deductability but the Senate preserved the rights of partnerships. The cost of the amendment is unknown, but it is some fraction of the A$170 million (1997/98) that would have been saved had the measure passed untouched.</p>
<p>-- Medical expenses rebate. People whose medical expenses exceed A$1,000 a year get a tax rebate, depending on their income. The government wanted to raise the income threshold but the Senate didn't. Value: A$26 million in 1997/98, A$24 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>-- Co-operatives financing tax break. The Senate preserved this this small tax break, mostly affecting primary producers. Value: A$2 million in 1997/98, A$6 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>SOCIAL SECURITY (NEWLY ARRIVED RESIDENTS' WAITING PERIODS) BILL, 1996.</p>
<p>The Senate has already mangled this bill. The government was going to insist that the Senate think again this week but has now dropped it off the schedule, presumably intending to bring it back next year. It seems unlikely to pass, so it is best counted as a loss. Contentious measure:</p>
<p>-- Migrants' social security waiting period. The government wanted to generally exclude migrants from social security for two years after arrival. Value before amendment: A$140 million in 1997/98, A$194 million in 1999/00. The Senate amendments cost most of the bill's value, according to government estimates: A$130 million in 1997/98, A$400 million over four years.</p>
<p>COURT FEES</p>
<p>This was a small measure effected by regulation but partly overruled by the Senate last month to soften its effect. The cost of the amendment is unknown, but it cannot be great. The contentious measure was:</p>
<p>-- Higher fees in federal courts. Value before amendment: A$27 million in 1997/98, A$31 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>---SURVIVORS---</p>
<p>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (NO.3), 1996</p>
<p>This bill suffered some injury, detailed above, when it was amended on Thursday and passed on Friday. Surviving contentious measures:</p>
<p>-- Research and development tax break legislation. Companies can now deduct only 125 percent of R&amp;D spending from taxable income instead of 150 percent. Value: A$430 million in 1997/98, A$440 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>-- R&amp;D syndication. The government says the syndication rules encourage exploitation of its tax break with false R&amp;D projects, so it wants to abolish the syndication. There was an amendment, discussed above. Value before amendment: A$170 million in 1997/98, $300 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>-- R&amp;D detail changes, such as the definitions of what constitutes R&amp;D. Value: A$118 million in 1997/98, A$100 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>CHILDCARE REGULATION</p>
<p>Independent backing helped the government see off a Labor-Democrat attempt to disallow this regulation.</p>
<p>-- Childcare rebate targetting. The budget applied mild means testing to the tax rebate for child care. Value: A$43 million in 1997/98, A$65 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL, 1996</p>
<p>This bill passed with small amendments. It includes:</p>
<p>-- Student charges. The government wants to hike some. Value: A$66 million in 1997/98, A$123 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>-- Student charges repayments. Students can defer payment of their charges until their income reaches a certain threshold. The government wants to drop that threshold. Value before amendment: A$230 million in 1997/98, A$318 million in 1999/00. The amendments cost A$60 million in the period to 1999/00 -- about A$20 million a year.</p>
<p>AUSTUDY REGULATION</p>
<p>The Senate disallowed this regulation earlier in the year. The government diluted it and it survived a second attempt at disallowance on Thursday. Its main contentious measure was:</p>
<p>-- Student income support ("Austudy"). The government wants to tighten eligibility, in part by excluding younger people. Original value: A$63 million in 1997/98, A$78 million in 1999/00. As passed: A$54 million in 1997/98, A$69 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL, 1996</p>
<p>This and the following bill passed on Friday. Several measures were lost, costing about A$100 million in 1997/98, as described above. Original contentious measures:</p>
<p>-- Activity tests. The government wants to impose several new requirements on people receiving unemployment benefits, such as a tighter definition of the sort of job they can reject and still receive money. Value: A$106 million in 1997/98, A$116 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>-- Social security advances. In some circumstances, the Social Security Department will pay in advance. The government wants to restrict this. Value: A$28 million in 1997/98, minus A$2.5 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>-- Earnings credits. Social security beneficiaries can sometimes spread out income they earn to reduce the effect on their entitlements. The government wants to end this. Value: A$76 million in 1997/98, A$83 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (FURTHER BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL, 1996</p>
<p>Passed on Friday and amended as described above. Contentious measures:</p>
<p>-- Superannuation means testing. The government wants to count retirement savings in means testing for social security beneficiaries aged between 55 and retirement age. Value: A$93 million in 1997/98, A$65 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>-- Rent assistance. The government wants to reduce social security for some single people in share accommodation. Value: A$33 million in 1997/98, A$41 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>NATIONAL HEALTH (BUDGET MEASURES) AMENDMENT BILL, 1996</p>
<p>This bill was dealt with on Friday and passed unamended.</p>
<p>-- Pharmaceutical benefit scheme changes. The government wants people to pay more for each prescription. Value: A$134 million in 1997/98, A$147 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>CHILDCARE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL, 1996</p>
<p>This bill was dealt with on Friday and passed unamended.</p>
<p>-- Childcare subsidies. The government wants to cut them. Value: A$45 million in 1997/98, A$53 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>---UPCOMING BILLS---</p>
<p>STUDENT AND YOUTH ASSISTANCE (WAITING PERIOD) BILL, 1996.</p>
<p>This bill, a relative of the migrants' social security bill, has been dropped from schedule for Friday and, therefore, for 1996. Its survival is highly doubtful. Contentious measure:</p>
<p>-- Migrants' student income support (Austudy) waiting period. The government wants to exclude immigrants from student income support for two years after their arrival. Value: A$12 million in 1997/98, A$13 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>BOUNTY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL, 1996</p>
<p>This bill is not expected in the Senate until next year, although a Senate committee has reported on it, Labor and the Democrats expressing their displeasure.</p>
<p>-- Bounties abolition. The government wants to abolish, or bring forward the abolition of, bounties on computers, shipbuilding, machine tools and books. Value: A$36 million in 1997/98, A$49 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>AGED CARE MEASURES</p>
<p>The government's aged care bill is not expected to appear even in the lower house before next year. It should include:</p>
<p>-- Nursing home charges. The government wants people to pay more. Value: A$125 million in 1997/98, A$194 million in 1999/00.</p>
<p>CHILDCARE REGULATION</p>
<p>This measure will be effected by a regulation (made by a minister), which parliament might seek to override.</p>
<p>-- Childcare rebate limit. The government seeks a limit to entitlement to the childcare tax rebate to 50 hours a week. Value: A$30 million in 1997/98, A$36 million in 1999/00.</p>
