<p>Peru's government on Sunday plotted its strategy to kick-start peace talks with Marxist rebels refusing to free 73 hostages unless their main demand for the release of jailed comrades is discussed.</p>
<p>Both sides have said they are ready to meet face-to-face but the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) insisted the government was blocking talks to end the 33-day siege by refusing to consider their main demand.</p>
<p>"There is no possibility of starting conversations because in practice they are asking us beforehand to drop our request, which signifies a formal call to surrender which we will never accept," an MRTA spokesman said on Saturday from within the besieged Japanese ambassador's residence.</p>
<p>The rebel spokesman, assumed to be MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa Cartolini, said via two-way radio that provided the issue of prisoner releases was on the table, "we are ready to converse as we were willing to since we occupied this diplomatic site."</p>
<p>The rebels have been forced to use their radios to communicate with the outside world after the government cut off electricity and telephone lines to the building soon after the MRTA stormed a diplomatic reception there on Dec. 17.</p>
<p>One of the hostages spent nearly one hour at the front of the compound on Sunday morning taking batteries from cars parked outside the building into the home.</p>
<p>The hostage, identified by witnesses as Japanese embassy second secretary Akihisa Ouyigama, lifted the hoods of two vehicles and removed the batteries.</p>
<p>"They must be using them (the batteries) for their radios," a police officer near the site said. "They (the rebels) are obliging the hostages to help them," he added.</p>
<p>Ouyigama had appeared with embassy attache Shinji Yanamoto on Saturday, rearranging MRTA signs haranguing the government which had blown back over the roof.</p>
<p>In its five-point communique on Saturday the MRTA accepted the government proposal of former hostage and Canadian ambassador Anthony Vincent on a "guarantor" commission to oversee talks.</p>
<p>The rebels had already agreed to a Red Cross and Vatican representative on the commission but have not said whether they will go along with a government proposal to hold talks outside of the residence.</p>
<p>With progress to end the crisis still slow, Japanese officials in Lima stepped up efforts to ease tensions inside the diplomatic mansion.</p>
<p>The Japanese task force in Lima announced on Sunday it had arranged to play soothing tunes to the hostages via a local radio station.</p>
<p>The songs, two Japanese and one Spanish, would have a relaxing effect and cheer the captives, a task force spokesman said. The radio station would also play "radio gymnastics" -- tunes to which listeners carry out stretching exercises, popular in Japan -- the spokesman said.</p>
<p>Outside the residence police tightened security, replacing national policemen with special force officers.</p>
<p>Witnesses noted unusual movement of security officers in the early hours with about 10 special police officers passing in front of the residence's main entrance just before 1 a.m. (0600 GMT), they said.</p>
<p>MRTA leader Nestor Cerpa has said previous threatening manoeuvres by police who approached the residence had provoked rebels to fire shots into the air from within the booby-trapped and mined compound where the rebels hold dozens of Peruvian government and security force officials, Japanese diplomats and businessmen.</p>
<p>President Alberto Fujimori, whose younger brother Pedro is also among the captives, received another boost for his tough line in handling the crisis.</p>
<p>A poll of 400 people in the capital released on Sunday showed that Fujimori's popularity had grown during the siege. According to local pollsters Analistas y Consultores, approval of Fujimori's government rose to 50 percent in January from 43 percent in December.</p>
<p>Fujimori has refused to bow to the rebels' demands to free jailed comrades although he did acknowldege on Saturday that it could be addressed in talks to end the crisis.</p>
<p>"It is likely to come up as a theme in the negotiations, but the Peruvian government will not agree to a release," he said in an interview with Japan's NHK television network.</p>
