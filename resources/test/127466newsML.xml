<p>Lloyds Chemists finance director Johnathan Fellows said the company is undecided on what advice to give its shareholders after UniChem renewed its bid for the company.</p>
<p>"We have no comment at this stage. We need to meet as a board and we clearly need to have some correspondence with our shareholders. We have not yet resolved what recommendations to make," said Fellows in an interview.</p>
<p>"I would hope to make an announcement in the next few days," he said. "What we will now need to do is to see if we can ascertain Gehe's intentions."</p>
<p>Earlier UniChem offered 16 new UniChem shares and 926p in cash, valuing each LLoyds Chemists share at 505.4p.</p>
