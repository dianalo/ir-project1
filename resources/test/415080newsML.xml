<p>U.S. equities have not fully exhausted their appeal despite some Wall Street murmurings that overall stock prices are overvalued, global fund managers and strategists said.</p>
<p>A Reuters global asset allocation poll found, on average, stock fund managers had upped their U.S. weighting to 35.6 percent of total assets by the end of February from about 27 percent in late December.  </p>
<p>These managers also decreased their non-core European allocations to 11.2 percent from 13 percent, and they lowered their UK holdings to 8.8 percent from 10 percent.</p>
<p>However, most analysts contended the modest allocation shift into U.S. equities does not imply a prodigious investment opportunity. Rather, the United States is a safe haven from shakier developed economies elsewhere, they said.</p>
<p>Indeed, many stock fund managers are still underweight U.S. equities when measured against the Morgan Stanley Capital International Market Capitalization Index, a widely accepted global benchmark.  </p>
<p>But compared to market conditions in the United Kingdom, the United States is seen as a safer scenario, said Putnam Investments senior analyst Jeff Knight, who increased his U.S. stock holdings using funds culled from UK allocations.</p>
<p>"Our outlook in the U.S. has stayed reasonably neutral," Knight said. "With the bond rally we saw in the last four or five weeks in the U.S., the U.S. equity market looked like a better opportunity than the UK," he said.</p>
<p>Additionally, allocations to both Japan and non-Japanese Asian stocks shrank to 12 percent from 16 percent and to 8.2 percent from 11 percent, respectively.  </p>
<p>"We've been underweight in Japan for a while," said Tadas Viskanta, vice president of asset allocation and investment strategy at First Chicago Investment Management Co.</p>
<p>"(Japan) still looks to us like it probably will underperform the rest of the world," he said.</p>
<p>However, Viskanta said the downward shift in non-Japanese Asian allocations is probably a result of a technical shift in weights rather than "a conscious decision to underweight."</p>
<p>"The one area we've liked the most over the last few months has been the emerging markets ... and the last six or seven weeks that's been a decent call," he said.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, bond funds saw similar yet smaller allocation shifts over the past couple of months. The most significant change occured in U.S. and non-core European weightings.</p>
<p>On average, U.S. debt allocations swelled to 30.2 percent of assets from 24.5, while the non-core European sector increased to 11.4 percent from about 9.0 percent.</p>
<p>Brian Gendreau, international markets strategist at J.P. Morgan &amp; Co, said he is "a little more sanguine" about the prospects of the U.S. bond market.  </p>
<p>In U.S. domestic allocations, mortgage-backed securities appeared more favorable than Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>Barry Evans, senior vice president and head of the government mortgage desk at John Hancock Funds, increased his mortgage-backed holdings and decreased his weighting in Treasuries.</p>
<p>Evans explained that mortgage-backed securities are generally used as neutral or defensive instruments.</p>
<p>"We wanted a spread we thought would be in the trading range ... and wanted to capture the spread there," he said.  </p>
<p>Country recommendations for the February survey were collected in late February. Full results of the survey follow. Monthly polls are also done from London (key  GB/ASSET F9) and  </p>
<p>Like Gendreau, many U.S. economists are calling for the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy before yearend, perhaps as soon as the spring.</p>
<p>If the Fed does rein in credit, the Treasury bond market's reaction will be muted, he said.</p>
<p>Gendreau asserted that the consensus among market participants is that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan has a "lot of credibility."</p>
<p>"If inflation gets out of hand and the economy becomes overheated, the Fed will put an end to the overheating," he said.  </p>
