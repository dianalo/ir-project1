<p>Direct mail order retailer N. Brown Group Plc said sales in the first five weeks of its second half were running around 20 percent up on last year.</p>
<p>Chief executive Jim Martin said, "The growth of sales of some 20 percent that we saw in the first six months has really continued through September."</p>
<p>Martin told Reuters in a telephone interview the group improved its operating margin in the first half by about 0.5 percent as a result of better response from marketing efforts, plus a more favourable retail climate. Gross margins were maintained.  </p>
<p>He said the group, which last year made an unsuccessful bid for privately-held mail order and football pools company Littlewoods, jointly with Iceland Plc, was now looking at small acquisitions in the direct mail business along the lines of Sartor, purchased for six million stg in the first half.</p>
<p>But the main emphasis would be on organic growth of its existing catalogues, which include Fashion World aimed at young customers and J.D. Williams and Oxendales for the 45-65 age group.</p>
<p>"I think really the focus of our intention is driving organically and growing the business that way."  </p>
<p>Family-owned Littlewoods rejected N. Brown and Iceland's bid and last week reiterated its desire to stay private.</p>
<p>"You've just got to acknowledge those wishes," Martin said.</p>
<p>The chief executive recognised that the entire mail order business in Britain, including catalogues which sell via agents, was ripe for consolidation.</p>
<p>"It is a market ready for consolidation, but I'm not sure where that consolidation will come."</p>
<p>Martin said paper costs in the first half grew by almost 40 percent, but the group was able to mitigate some of worst effects of that increase.  </p>
<p>He said paper costs were now starting to reverse."We expect in autumn/winter of 1997 the cost of paper will fall below its cost prior to spring 1996. So it's past the worst."</p>
<p>Martin said Manchester-based N. Brown had about 25 percent of the direct mail order market in Britain and about five percent of the total market, which includes companies which use agents to handle sales.</p>
<p>The company's shares were up 22p at 400 by 0835 GMT, following the results news.</p>
