<p>Multi-million dollar Argentine international defender Matias Almeyda began training with his Sevilla team mates on Wednesday and looks set to make his debut for the Spanish club in Sunday's home game against Zaragoza.</p>
<p>The former River Plate star was received on Tuesday by 12,000 Sevilla fans in an atmosphere of euphoria similar to that surrounding the arrival of another Argentine, World Cup midfielder Diego Maradona, in 1992.</p>
<p>"It's like a dream, I could stay here all night," said Almeyda of the supporters' welcome.</p>
<p>Almeyda, 22, played a prominent part in helping Argentina to win a silver medal in the Atlanta Olympic Games and is a regular at full international level.</p>
