<p>Hong Kong stocks have blasted into record ground in the dying days of colonial rule, giving China a rousing welcome as investors revel in the prospects of closer ties with the mainland's burgeoning economy.</p>
<p>With business opportunities abounding in China and mainland money flowing into the territory, capitalist Hong Kong -- it boasts the seventh largest stock market in the world -- is set for a new phase of growth, analysts said.</p>
<p>"An emerging economy is merging with a developed market which surely must be the best type of combination," said David Semple, regional strategist at Peregrine Asset Management.</p>
<p>"You have an enormous economy needing an enormous amount of capital and the obvious place to look for it is in Hong Kong."</p>
<p>CHINA TO KEEP PUSHING HANG SENG INDEX TO NEW HIGHS</p>
<p>In a frenzy of euphoria ahead of Britain's handover of Hong Kong to China at midnight on June 30, the blue chip Hang Seng Index has surged 14 percent since the start of the year, hitting an all-time high of 15,322.33 points last Monday, June 23.</p>
<p>According to a recent Reuters poll of Hong Kong analysts, the index should add another 19 percent over the next 18 months.</p>
<p>"China will continue to keep the upward pressure on the Hang Seng Index," said Robert Rountree, regional strategist at Nomura Research Institute.</p>
<p>"The Chinese economy will look pretty good next year which is one reason why we are so bullish on the market," he said.</p>
<p>China's economy is expected to grow at an annual pace of nine to 10 percent for the next several years, providing plenty of opportunities for business expansion.</p>
<p>"There is a 1.2 billion person, US$700 billion economy sitting right next door which is available for investment, commerce, trade and expansion," said one fund manager.</p>
<p>"China is not such a bad place to be investing," he said.</p>
<p>CHINA GROWTH TO SPUR EARNINGS GROWTH</p>
<p>As Hong Kong companies continue to participate in projects on the mainland, they should generate a strong stream of future earnings through their exposure to China, analysts said.</p>
<p>The emergence of Chinese red chip powerhouses, whose market capitalisation has ballooned in recent months, should also become a powerful engine of growth as they expand rapidly through asset injections from their mainland parents.</p>
<p>"The most interesting issue is that there is going to be a far more diversified mix," said Abhijit Chakrabortti, senior strategist at Lehman Brothers.</p>
<p>"It will be going away from a concentration on financial assets and financial earnings, totally driven by property and banks, to companies which have real assets and real earnings and give access to mainland growth," he said.</p>
<p>Property stocks represent nearly one third of the market capitalisation of the Hang Seng Index and banking earnings are heavily influenced by fluctuations in the real estate market.</p>
<p>But as red chips grow, the Hang Seng Index is set to evolve, bringing higher growth stocks into its fold.</p>
<p>"Several components of the Hang Seng Index will see their importance diminish. Some of them will exit the index and be replaced by some red chip companies which are part of the Hang Seng China-Affiliated Corporations Index," said Chakrabortti.</p>
<p>The China-Affiliated Corporations Index was launched earlier this month and since its June 16 launch has gained 21 percent.</p>
<p>CHINESE CHARACTERISTICS BRING MORE SPECULATIVE MARKET</p>
<p>But as Hong Kong takes on its new Chinese characteristics, the market may also find itself subject to more speculative activity -- a favourite pastime of the betting-mad Chinese.</p>
<p>Mainland money has already found its way into Hong Kong, bolstering market turnover to record levels, and should continue flowing in as punters bet on asset injections for red chip stocks and mainland acquisitions into blue chip companies.</p>
<p>"We are in the midst of the biggest mergers and acquisitions bonanza that the world has seen for a long time," said Semple.</p>
<p>Analysts showed little concern about Chinese interference in the market despite Beijing's recent attempts to dampen speculation. It has recently tightened its rules on overseas listings and asset injections and ordered state banks earlier this month to stop trading in stocks.</p>
<p>"They are not really interfering with the market. What they are interfering with is at what price and at what level their assets are given away," said Semple.</p>
<p>"In the longer term China appreciates and understands the need for a very efficient capital market in Hong Kong and in the short term that might mean preventing booms and busts," he said.</p>
<p>As Hong Kong celebrates its return to Chinese rule on July 1, the stock market will be closed from Monday to Wednesday. When it reopens on Thursday, the new era under China is expected to usher in a flood of Chinese money.</p>
<p>"China will want to see the market do well after the handover," said Percy Au-young, director of research at DBS Securities. "Chinese money will push the Hang Seng Index up."</p>
