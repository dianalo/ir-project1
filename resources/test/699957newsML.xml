<p>Hillenbrand Industries Inc said Tuesday it remains optimistic due to margin gains and new product development, despite soft revenue growth.</p>
<p>The company announced net income for the second quarter ended May 31 of $37 million on sales of $426 million, compared to year-ago earnings of $34 million on sales of $424 million.</p>
<p>"Although revenue growth continues to be soft due to continued economic weakness and reduced health care expenditures in Europe and a lower death rate in the United States, we are very pleased with margin improvements, cost controls and new product development," said chief executive Gus Hillenbrand.</p>
<p>"Aggressive new product development efforts by all of our business units cause us to remain optimistic about our future growth," he said.</p>
<p>Hillenbrand makes caskets, cremation urns, hospital beds, hospital furniture and security locks, and sells funeral insurance.  </p>
<p>Health care segment sales were flat compared with a year ago, excluding the impact of lower sales in Europe, unfavorable currency adjustments and the disposition of Block Medical, the revenues of which were included in the second quarter of 1996, Hillenbrand said.</p>
<p>"Health care sales gross profit margins improved 1.2 percentage points due to a shift in sales mix to higher-margin products, good cost controls and declining losses in our European operations," it said.</p>
<p>Health care rental revenues were flat, while health care rentals gross margins grew 4.7 percentage points. Hill-Rom operating profit was down as improved gross profit was offset by more investment in new product development, it said.</p>
<p>Funeral services revenue grew on increased casket and cremation urn shipments despite a lower death rate during the quarter.</p>
<p>"Good growth in new products in the wood and stainless steel casket lines, coupled with continued double-digit growth in cremation products, were responsible for the revenue increase," the company said.  </p>
<p>Funeral services gross margins improved 1.5 percentage points due to good cost controls, while insurance revenues grew 23 percent and gross margins grew 1.6 percentage points.</p>
<p>Shares in Hillenbrand were up 3/16 to 47-11/16.</p>
