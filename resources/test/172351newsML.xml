<p>Zambia has privatised more than half the state-owned companies earmarked for sale under a privatisation programme that can be described as one of the most successful in sub-Saharan Africa, the country's privatisation agency said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Zambia Privatisation Agency (ZPA) technical director Stuart Cruickshank told Reuters that the World Bank recently praised the country's efforts to privatise state-owned assets since the agency was established in September 1992.</p>
<p>"They have highlighted Zambia as the most successful privatisation programme in sub-Saharan Africa," Cruickshank said in an interview.</p>
<p>After independence from Britain in 1964, the Zambian government nationalised about 80 percent of the country's economy -- including coal mines, breweries and the largest Zambian company, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines Ltd (ZCCM).</p>
<p>Cruickshank said some 140 companies or business units have been privatised to date.</p>
<p>"We are somewhere around 140 sold to date which is probably more than half, but the ones that are remaining are some of the bigger ones."</p>
<p>The ZPA said in June that the privatisation process had brought in around $139 million and this will soar with the next phase of the process which will see the government selling off the majority of the country's big companies -- with ZCCM the first.</p>
<p>"The progress is extremely satisfactory here," Cruickshank said, explaining that the ZPA was operating free of government control.</p>
<p>"The big difference between the programme in Zambia and (privatisation) elsewhere...has to be the political will," he added.</p>
<p>Of ZPA's 12 directors, only three represent the government. The other nine directors represent the private sector and trade unions. "The whole process is as transparent as possible," Cruickshank said.</p>
<p>Zambian President Frederick Chiluba's cabinet only involvement is to advise the ZPA which companies should be sold and by which method.</p>
<p>The agency widely advertises the proposed sales and issues regular reports on the privatisation process.</p>
<p>The sale of ZCCM -- whose copper and cobalt exports are responsible for most of Zambia's foreign earnings -- drew wide interest and the ZPA said last month 39 companies had pre-qualified to buy the company's mining and power generation assets.</p>
<p>Among the foreign companies that qualified are South Africa's Anglovaal Ltd, Australia's giant Broken Hill Proprietary Ltd (BHP), and South African mining giant Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd, which already holds a minority stake in ZCCM.</p>
<p>"The tenders are closing at the end of February and we hope that the privatisation...will be completed by the middle of next year," Cruickshank said.</p>
<p>The government would retain a 20 percent share in the ZCCM units up for sale but this stake would be sold to the Zambian public within two years, he added.</p>
<p>Cruickshank said about $2 billion new investment was needed on Zambia's copper belt to bring mines up to modern standards.</p>
<p>"There has been a lack of investment because the money that ZCCM created was utilised for a number of other requirements by government and wasn't fed back into ZCCM the way it should have been.</p>
<p>"Obviously copper mining is an extremely important part of the economy. It is 80 percent of all exports," he said.</p>
<p>Chiluba has said that the privatisation process has to be completed by 1998.</p>
<p>"There is still a lot of work to be done," Cruickshank said.</p>
