<p>Cruise Holdings Ltd told Reuters on Monday it plans to acquire the cruise vessel Rotterdam from Carnival Corp.</p>
<p>The terms were not revealed.</p>
<p>"We have entered into a definitive letter of intent with Carnival and their Holland America Line arm in order to buy the Rotterdam," Larry Magnan, Cruise Holdings president and chief executive officer, told Reuters. "We expect that transaction to close on around October 1."</p>
<p>He refused to comment on the sale price for the ship, which was built in 1959.</p>
<p>"We are happy and they are happy," Magnan said. "It was a competitive price."</p>
<p>Rotterdam is operated by Carnival's Holland American Line Westours Inc subsidiary in Seattle. The company was unable to provide a comment.</p>
<p>Carnival previously said it intended to decommission the Rotterdam on September 30. It will be superseded in Carnival's fleet on October 6 by Rotterdam IV, built at a shipyard in Venice, Italy.</p>
<p>Rotterdam will be Miami-based Cruise Holdings' sixth ship. The acquisition builds on the company's niche position as owner and operator of 'classic' old cruise vessels for the mass cruise market, Magnan said.</p>
<p>Cruise Holdings will unveil a new corporate identity on September 9, combining the group's three brands, Seawind Cruise Line, Dolphin Cruise Line and Premier Cruise Line, Magnan said.</p>
<p>"After a great deal of market research and focus studies we have decided that, with the three bands, we have now it is cumbersome, so we are going to announce the 'new' company," Magnan said.</p>
<p>"The ships will stay the same, but under a new umbrella company."</p>
