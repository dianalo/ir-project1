<p>Unbeaten World Boxing Council super lightweight champion Oscar de la Hoya continued on course for a string of lucrative title-unification fights by battering former champion Miguel Angel Gonzalez to win by unanimous decision Saturday.</p>
<p>While de la Hoya stepped up to the challenge posed by the formidable Mexican, International Boxing Federation junior flyweight champion Michael Carbajal was shocked by Colombian Mauricio Pastrana in a split decision.</p>
<p>Undefeated junior welterweight champion Kostya Tszyu of Australia retained his IBF junior welterweight crown but suffered the first blemish on his record in the process.</p>
<p>Russian-born Tszyu hammered Puerto Rican Leonardo Mas, knocking him down twice in the first round, but in the final seconds of the opening round, Tszyu hit Mas as referee Joe Cortez was stepping in to break up the fighters.</p>
<p>The punch, ruled unintentional, broke the jaw of Mas, who could not continue. It was ruled an "accidental foul" and left Tszyu's record at 18-0-1.</p>
<p>Mas (23-2-1) 15 KOs) is ranked ninth by the IBF and was fighting for his first major world title.</p>
<p>De la Hoya put on a boxing clinic as he used a dead-on jab and series of left hooks to build a big early lead and answer any questions about the strength of his left shoulder. A case of tendinitis had kept de la Hoya out of the ring since June.</p>
<p>Gonzalez, who had points deducted in the seventh and 12th rounds, was never in the fight. Judge John Keane of England scored the bout 117-111, Anek Hongtongkam of Thailand had it 117-110 and Bob Logist of Belgium 117-109.</p>
<p>De la Hoya improved to 23-0 with 20 wins within the distance. Gonzalez lost for the first time in 42 career bouts.</p>
<p>Pastrana, the top-ranked contender, used strong combinations and relentless determination to edge Carbajal and capture the title in his first try.</p>
<p>Carbajal, who fell to 44-3, did little to earn the close verdict. Pastrana (16-0) had Carbajal wobbly in the third round of a bout in which neither fighter landed many power punches.</p>
