<p>British interest rates are expected to remain unchanged at six percent until after the election following recent signs of a slowdown in the economy, a Reuters survey showed on Friday.</p>
<p>A majority of economists, 23 out of 24, do not expect a change in interest rates after the monthly monetary meeting next Wednesday between Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke and Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George.</p>
<p>"On the whole since the last meeting when the Chancellor did not want to hike interest rates, virtually all the data releases have come down on his side," said Jeremy Hawkins, chief economist Europe at Bank of America.</p>
<p>"GDP and retail sales did not show the type of acceleration which would justify a rate rise".</p>
<p>December retail sales fell 0.8 percent month-on-month from a rise of 0.8 percent in November. Year-on-year retail sales rose 2.9 percent in December from a four percent rise in November.</p>
<p>Gross domestic product in the last three months of 1996 rose 0.8 percent quarter-on-quarter and 2.6 percent year-on-year compared to 0.7 percent and 2.4 percent for quarter three.</p>
<p>Eleven contributors to the survey expect a 25 basis point rise in rates after the election which has to be held by May 22. Another 11 expect a 50 basis point rise.</p>
<p>"It's unlikely that rates will rise before the election and this means that when they eventually have to tighten there will be pressure for a bigger rise," said Ian Amstad, senior economist at Bankers Trust.</p>
<p>Sterling strength on the foreign exchange markets will help the chancellor to delay a rise in interest rates, analysts say.</p>
<p>"The currency is still strong even though it has come off in the last few days. If it were to weaken dramatically over the next few weeks then we might be facing a rate hike before the election," Amstad said.</p>
<p>Sterling rose to a 52-month high versus the mark at 2.7120 on January 22. On Friday it was trading around 2.6150 marks.</p>
<p>Olwen Renowden, economist at Sakura Finance, does not expect an interest rate rise next week, but she is expecting a rise before the election.</p>
<p>"Some of the economic data do look weak, but money indicators have been and still are quite strong".</p>
<p>M4 money supply rose 9.5 percent year-on-year in December from a rise of 10.8 percent in November, still outside the government's target channel of three to nine percent.</p>
<p>Steve Hannah, chief economist at IBJ International, believes there is a possibility that interest rates will rise by 25 basis points after the meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Clarke will not want too wide a gap between himself and Eddie George, who has already indicated he will be pressing for a 50 basis point rise," Hannah said.</p>
<p>"Signs that the economy is slowing are less than convincing and to have your central bank disagreeing with you is not good politics. It also makes the market nervous".</p>
