<title>GERMANY: Bonn sick pay law in tatters as employers retreat.</title>
<headline>Bonn sick pay law in tatters as employers retreat.</headline>
<dateline>FRANKFURT, Germany</dateline>

<p>A law designed to spearhead a cut in German labour costs was thrown into doubt on Monday as employers in both the engineering and banking sectors were forced by union pressure to retreat from applying it.</p>
<p>The law, which from last October allows companies to cut sick pay entitlements by 20 percent, was originally seen as a 12 billion German mark ($7.7 billion) gift from Chancellor Helmut Kohl to employers who have long bemoaned Germany's high labour costs.</p>
<p>But with mass protests by German workers discouraging more and more companies from putting the law into effect, it now looks like a booby-trap that could ultimately blow up in the face of both German industry and Kohl's government.</p>
<p>Germany's banking industry -- which was virtually alone in putting the law into effect immediately -- said on Monday that it had now agreed to postpone the cuts until a wider wage agreement with the 460,000 staff in the industry was reached.</p>
<p>Suspending stoppages due in the industry later this week, officials at the HBV banking trade union declared the retreat as an "intermediate success" demonstrating the effect of walk-outs involving 15,000 bank workers last month.</p>
<p>The back-down by banks came after the admission on Sunday by Gesamtmetall, the metal and engineering employers' group, that it would have to accept a regional wage deal signed in the sector last week that also did not implement the sick pay law.</p>
<p>The set-back for the law in the metal and engineering sectors has been mirrored by similar retreats in the food, chemical and other industries.</p>
<p>The latest victory for workers was the decision by the German unit of Swiss food giant Nestle SA on Sunday to continue full sick payments after weeks of strikes by employees in its Hamburg and Berlin plants.</p>
