<p>Germany's opposition Social Democrats talked tough on Monday, ahead of talks seeking a compromise on tax reform, and seemed ready to continue to block government plans.</p>
<p>Parliament's 32-member mediation committee, drawn equally from the upper and lower houses, is set to start mediation on Thursday.</p>
<p>It will try to thrash out a compromise after the upper house, the Bundesrat, where the Social Democrats (SPD) have a majority, blocked two tax bills last week.</p>
<p>A working group of experts from both sides met on Monday to begin attempts to reach a deal ahead of formal mediation.</p>
<p>The legislation covering tax cuts for 1998 and 1999 easily passed in the lower house, or Bundestag, where a majority of deputies is from Chancellor Helmut Kohl's coalition of Christian Democrats (CDU/CSU) and Free Democrats (FDP).</p>
<p>But the Social Democrats appear more determined than ever to try to block the goverment's broad tax reform until after the next general election in 1998.</p>
<p>Peter Struck, SPD parliamentary group manager, said the mediation was not required to reach a compromise.</p>
<p>"It must be possible in a democracy that in such an important question ... there is no agreement and that different concepts are simply put up to the vote," Struck told Berlin's InfoRadio.</p>
<p>"I am very optimistic about this because I know that those who should really profit from a tax reform are normal citizens and we have the better proposals for that," he added.</p>
<p>The SPD, which controls a majority of states and therefore has the upper hand in the Bundesrat, rejects the government's idea of cutting the top income tax rate to 39 percent from 53 percent and wants instead to lower unit wage costs.</p>
<p>It says so-called supplementary wage costs, extra charges on labour that are not associated with production, should be reduced or removed from unit wages and instead be financed elsewhere.</p>
<p>It has called the government's bills socially unjust and is trying to divide the coalition proposals, hinting that it could agree on certain parts but not on the coalition's broad reform.</p>
<p>Gerhard Schroeder, SPD premier of Lower Saxony and a leading candidate to challenge Kohl in elections next year, proposed reaching agreement on the points where the government and opposition were close but not on the overall reform.</p>
<p>"I am optimistic that we could agree quickly on at least two points -- abolishing taxes on corporate trading capital and lowering supplementary wage costs," he told the daily Bild newspaper.</p>
<p>But the government coalition is still insisting that any deal must include lower income tax rates or there could be no agreement.</p>
<p>FDP leader Wolfgang Gerhardt told reporters ahead of a meeting of his party's leadership that the coalition had agreed there would be no tax increases in 1997 and 1998 to finance the budget deficit</p>
<p>At the weekend Finance Minister Theo Waigel confirmed that the federal budget deficit was forecast to surge to 70 billion marks ($40.1 billion) this year from previous forecasts of 53.3 billion. ($ = 1.747 German Marks)</p>
