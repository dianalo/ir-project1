<p>South African police on Tuesday arrested a second right-wing white wanted in connection with Christmas Eve bomb blasts that killed four blacks.</p>
<p>A police statement said Nicolaas Barnard was arrested on a farm in the arid Karoo region of Western Cape province. Police seized a number of handguns and rifles.</p>
<p>Barnard was among nine right-wingers convicted of murder last year for having planted bombs in and around Johannesburg that killed 20 people at the time of South Africa's first all-race election in April 1994. He and three others escaped from custody and have been on the run for nearly a year.</p>
<p>Police said Barnard and the two fellow escapees were also wanted for questioning about the Christmas Eve pipe bomb blasts in the farming town of Worcester northeast of Cape Town.</p>
<p>One of the three was arrested earlier this month on a farm near Johannesburg.</p>
