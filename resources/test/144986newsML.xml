<p>Japan's crude oil imports amounted to 20.27 million kilolitres in September, down 4.4 percent from the same month last year, the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) said on Friday.</p>
<p>Crude imports have fallen from most areas, with the exception of China and Africa.</p>
<p>A MITI official attributed the decline in imports largely to loading schedules of crude oil shipments.</p>
<p>He added that crude oil imports for the July-September period were about the same as a year earlier, and had declined only 0.5 percent from the third quarter last year.  </p>
<p>Japan imported a total of 124.07 million kl of crude oil in the first half of fiscal 1996/97, down 1.8 percent from April to September 1995.</p>
<p>The Middle East has traditionally been the largest source of crude oil for Japan, and in September the Gulf accounted for 78.8 percent of Japan's total oil imports.</p>
<p>The United Arab Emirates was the largest source of crude oil followed by Saudi Arabia and Iran.</p>
<p>Japan imported 5.18 million kl of crude oil from the United Arab Emirates, 3.37 million kl from Saudi Arabia and 2.56 million kl from Iran.  </p>
<p>Crude oil from Africa showed a marked jump in September.</p>
<p>Japan imported a total of about 238,000 kl of oil from Africa in September, up 43.2 percent from August.</p>
<p>A total of 82,000 kl of Nigeria's Bonny Light crude was shipped to Japan in September, up 27.7 percent from August.</p>
<p>Japan also imported a total of 156,000 kl of Palanca crude from Angola. The crude was not imported in August.</p>
<p>China was another country that shipped more oil to Japan in September than in August.</p>
<p>Crude oil from China amounted to 1.45 million kl in September, up 15.7 percent from August.</p>
<p>Crude throughput in September amounted to 19.43 million kl, down 0.3 percent from a year earlier.</p>
<p>It was the first time in five months that crude throughput had shown a year-on-year decline.</p>
