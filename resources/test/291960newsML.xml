<p>A large explosion, believed to be a car bomb, rocked central Algiers on Tuesday afternoon, residents said.</p>
<p>Speaking by telephone from Algiers, they described a huge explosion in the area of the main university faculty at one end of the main shopping street, Rue Didouche Mourad. One quoted a taxi driver who said he had witnessed the blast which was believed to have been a car bomb.</p>
<p>There was no immediate information on casualties or comment from the authorities.</p>
<p>Algiers has been the target of numerous bomb attacks blamed by the authorities on Moslem fundamentalists. Two car bombs in Algiers late in December killed at least 18 people.</p>
<p>The latest blast occurred amid a spate of rebel raids on villages in which at least 38 people were killed within a 24-hour period last week.</p>
<p>The violence flared as Prime Minister Ahmed Ouyahia said in a speech his government had crushed the Islamist guerrillas.</p>
<p>About 60,000 people have been killed, including more than 1,400 in bomb attacks, in Algeria since early 1992 when the authorities cancelled a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a commanding lead.</p>
<p>The worst bombing in Algiers was in 1995 when Moslem rebels slammed a car laden with explosives into the main police station in Colonel Amirouche street, killing more than 40 people and wounding more than 300.</p>
