<p>Gold fixed in London at $377.00 an ounce on Thursday afternoon, a fresh low since March 6, 1995.</p>
<p>Bullion had fixed at $378.50 an ounce in the morning, but came under selling pressure in the afternoon and was vulnerable to further downside losses, dealers said.  </p>

<p>Immediately after the fixing, gold was testing levels below $376 an ounce, which have not been seen for nearly two years. It slumped to a low so far of $375.70 an ounce.</p>
<p>"Below $377, gold isn't going to find much support before $374-$375," one London-based dealer said.</p>
<p>Sentiment in the gold market has been increasingly bearish in recent days since speculators were discouraged by the failure of a rally last week that peaked at just under $385 an ounce.</p>
<p>Silver shed about three cents so far in sympathy with gold's downward shift but was holding steady above $4.90 an ounce. The other precious metals were also stable.</p>
