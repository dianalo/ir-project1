<p>The British government prepared on Wednesday to unveil plans to impose some of the world's strictest gun laws in response to the Dunblane massacre in March when a crazed loner shot dead 16 children and their teacher.</p>
<p>Officials privately confirmed media leaks that Prime Minister John Major, bowing to public outrage over the killings, would go beyond the recommendations of a judicial inquiry and ban most of Britain's 200,000 legally held handguns.</p>
<p>According to the media reports, the only handguns Britons would be allowed to hold would be single-shot .22-inch calibre weapons, widely used in shooting competitions.</p>
<p>These smaller guns, accounting for 10 percent of the total, would have to be kept at registered gun clubs.</p>
<p>The sweeping curbs mark a victory for Scottish Secretary Michael Forsyth, whose own parliamentary constituency includes Dunblane, and for a grassroots campaign that has collected 750,000 signatures on a petition calling for a total ban.</p>
<p>A senior judge, Lord Douglas Cullen, presented a report to ministers on Monday thought to recommend that handguns should be banned from private homes and kept instead at registered clubs.</p>
<p>But Major, advised that he risked defeat in parliament unless he went further, decided at a meeting with senior ministers on Tuesday to opt for an almost total ban.</p>
<p>Even so, Major cannot count on reaping political credit from the proposals as he fights to revive his Conservative Party's flagging fortunes in time for an election now no more than seven months away.</p>
<p>For a start, Major risks being outflanked by the main opposition Labour party, which wants a total ban on handguns.</p>
<p>Nor will his proposals satisfy some members of his own party, who say that only an outright ban will satisfy voters increasingly worried that gun violence in Britain could become as commonplace as in America.</p>
<p>"Dunblane was a defining moment in the history of our society. This required definitive action," David Mellor, a former Conservative minister, said.</p>
<p>"Today we are going to get, at long last, months after we could have had it, some definitive action," Mellor, who wants a free vote on whether to ban handguns altogether, told BBC radio.</p>
<p>Dunblane has become synonymous with senseless violence since Thomas Hamilton, a loner with a worrying fondness for young boys, walked into the town's primary school in March and coldly began a slaughter of the innocents.</p>
<p>Hamilton, who held gun certificates from the police and was a member of a gun club, then turned one of his four semi-automatic pistols on himself.</p>
<p>Rosemary Hunter, one of the organisers of the anti-gun petition, said that if .22 weapons remained legal, another Dunblane could not be ruled out.</p>
<p>"Someone with Hamilton's mentality can simply book the weapon out (for a competition at another gun club) and then...commit such an atrocity as we saw on March 13," she said.</p>
<p>Gun ownership is relatively rare in Britain. Opinion polls show around 70 percent of Britons want a total handgun ban.</p>
<p>Gun lobbyists counter that the vast majority of the 57,000 holders of handgun licences practise target shooting and other legitimate activities and should not be penalised for the actions of one deranged gunman.</p>
<p>If the government pushes through restrictions on handguns, it will be the second time within months that a developed country has cracked down on firearms following a mass slaughter.</p>
<p>In July, Australian Prime Minister John Howard won national agreement to laws banning self-loading guns and tightening firearm ownership rules after 35 people were shot dead at the Port Arthur tourist site on the island of Tasmania on April 28.</p>
