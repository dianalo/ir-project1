<p>U.S. congressmen just back from visiting North Korea said on Wednesday they believe some foreign food aid might have been diverted to the communist state's military.</p>
<p>Seven members of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence told a joint news conference in Seoul they would seek measures to ensure future U.S. aid to North Korea would go directly to hunger-stricken people.</p>
<p>"I believe we would all agree that some food aid has probably ended up in the hands of the military and the other elites in the country and we are concerned about that," California lawmaker Jane Harman said. No one in the team contested his remarks.</p>
<p>The delegation, led by intelligence committee chairman Porter Goss, came to Seoul on Tuesday via Tokyo to brief South Korean officials on its three-day visit to North Korea.</p>
<p>Seoul foreign ministry officials said their visit was the largest yet by U.S. officials.</p>
<p>The congressmen said they saw serious food problems in the impoverished nation and agreed on the need for more aid.</p>
<p>Harman, a Democrat, said some international aid officials the delegation interviewed in North Korea "confirmed that some food is reaching the people".</p>
<p>Another delegation member, Nancy Pelosi, like Harman a Democrat from California, said the North did not allow them to monitor food aid distribution.</p>
<p>"Despite repeated requests by members of this delegation to visit a distribution centre we were not able to do that," Pelosi said.</p>
<p>Pelosi said the delegation would have a hard time convincing other U.S. congressmen that Washington should continue its humanitarian aid to help stave off famine in the North.</p>
<p>"In terms of future U.S. aid we made clear that we need assurance that that aid go directly to the people who most need it," Harman said.</p>
<p>Goss, a Republican from Florida, said Pyongyang officials demanded Washington provide substantial food aid before holding formal four-nation talks aimed at forging a mechanism to end Cold War confrontation on the Korean peninsula.</p>
<p>The congressmen went to the reclusive North shortly after the two Koreas, the United States and China held their first four-nation meeting in New York last week.</p>
<p>Senior officials of the four nations failed to set an agenda for formal talks proposed by Seoul and Washington but agreed to meet again on September 15.</p>
<p>The peninsula has remained a flashpoint since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a truce agreement, and not with a peace treaty.</p>
<p>Goss said North Koreans demanded that "before those four-party talks could proceed with any immediate probability of success, the United States needed to provide substantially more food assistance to the people of North Korea".</p>
<p>Washington has led international efforts to provide food supplies to the North, pledging $52 million so far this year through the United Nations World Food Programme.</p>
<p>Pyongyang negotiators have repeatedly demanded more food assistance during the preparatory negotiations but Seoul and Washington ruled out any large-scale aid until the four nations begin substantive peace talks.</p>
<p>Goss said Pyongyang officials told him they did not want a serious dialogue with Seoul until the end of South Korean President Kim Young-sam's five-year term.</p>
<p>Kim has been reviled almost daily by the North Korean official media since his refusal to mourn the death three years ago of North Korea's founder, "Great Leader" Kim Il-sung.</p>
