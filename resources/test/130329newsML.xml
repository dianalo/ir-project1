<p>The Argentine government is considering postponing plans to introduce a new 10 percent tax on new diesel cars to April 1 from January 1, Horacio Losoviz, head of the industry association ADEFA, said Monday.</p>
<p>Losoviz told reporters that he was informed of the possible change by Economy Minister Roque Fernandez at a meeting they held earlier in the day.</p>
<p>The 10 percent tax hike was announced in August as part of an austerity package launched by Fernandez in an effort to bridge the budget deficit this year and next.</p>
