<p>Naphtha edged up on Wednesday on crude's rebound while gasoline was steady in lacklustre dealings, traders said.</p>
<p>The stronger naphtha prices in Asia have opened up the arbitrage window for Algerian and Suez cargoes, traders said.</p>
<p>But naphtha trade was stymied as traders eyed Mideast term negotiations.</p>
<p>Kuwait Petroleum Corp's (KPC) term talks in London for one-year supplies of over two million tonnes of paraffinic naphtha starting in August, traders said the offer was indicated at $20 per tonne over Mideast naphtha spot quotes, fob.  </p>
<p>But they said one South Korean firm bid at a $13.50, while other Asian buyers have yet to indicate their buying idea.</p>
<p>In ADNOC term talks, buyers were standing firm at a $19-$20 premium while ADNOC had lowered its offer to $21.75 from $22.50.</p>
<p>Fresh gasoline demand from Indonesia has yet to emerge, limiting regional demand to India's tender closing June 12 and valid for a day.</p>
<p>Pakistan's Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Resources bought from Mideast trader Star Energy, one 25,000 tonne cargo of 80-octane 0.15 grammes per litre motor gasoline for July delivery at around $25 per tonne over Mideast naphtha quotes,  </p>
<p>c+f Pakistan -- almost on par with its last purchase of two cargoes in May at a $25.43 premium.</p>
<p>But its optional purchase for September delivery from U.K.-based trader Hascombe was much firmer at a premium of around $29.00.</p>
