<p>Colombian forward Faustino Asprilla has pulled out of his country's World Cup qualifier in Venezuela next week after straining a hamstring in Newcastle's 2-0 UEFA Cup victory over Metz on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Asprilla, who scored both Newcastle goals, blamed himself and the rain-soaked St James Park pitch for the injury.</p>
<p>"I probably need to do more exercises in the warm-up to stop this problem occurring again," he said. "It's the first time I've had a problem like this with the right leg and it's probably because of the heavier pitches."</p>
<p>Newcastle manager Kevin Keegan said Asprilla could be sidelined for six weeks but club physio Derek Wright said he might be back before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Colombia are top of the South American World Cup qualifying group with four wins and two draws from their six games. Venezuela are bottom and have yet to win.</p>
