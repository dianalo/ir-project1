<p>French President Jacques Chirac, triumphantly elected only two years ago this month, puts his future on the line on Tuesday when he addresses the country in a bid to salvage a general election gone disastrously wrong.</p>
<p>Chirac speaks on television at eight p.m. (1800 GMT) to try to swing voters behind his centre-right coalition, which took an unexpected whipping at the polls on Sunday in the first round of a snap general election which he called to consolidate his term, which has five years to run.</p>
<p>But, against all expectations and most opinion polls, the opposition left chalked up 44 percent of the votes, when counting the Greens, the biggest environmental group which has an electoral pact with the Socialists.</p>
<p>The centre-right RPR-UDF coalition and other moderate rightists scored only 36.5 percent while the extreme-right National Front, which loathes Chirac, got 14.94 percent.</p>
<p>Polling institutes projected the left would win a slim overall majority in next Sunday's run-off if the pattern were repeated.</p>
<p>Analysts cautioned the race was still wide open, with the difference in seats between the two blocs equivalent to less than one percentage point of the popular vote.</p>
<p>But Chirac was still faced with the real, grim possibility that he might be saddled in less than a week with a hostile parliament and constitutionally obliged to appoint opposition Socialist leader Lionel Jospin as his prime minister.</p>
<p>This would inaugurate a period of "cohabitation" in which the two strong personalities would inevitably be pitted against one another, possibly leading to repeated conflict, or at least protracted paralysis of government.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, it would nearly inevitably dash Chirac's hopes of leading France in the construction of Europe with himself as one of its prime leaders.</p>
<p>In order to turn the situation around, Chirac on Monday jettisoned his own unpopular premier and close aide for two decades, Alain Juppe, less than 24 hours after the first round.</p>
<p>After calling on Chirac, Juppe told a meeting of coalition leaders: "We need a new team led by a new prime minister."</p>
<p>Opposition leaders jeered, leading Socialist spokesman Jack Lang calling the dumping of Juppe, who will presumably leave office next week, "a sign of panic in government ranks."</p>
<p>Extreme rightist leader Jean-Marie Le Pen said Chirac had acted like a sea captain throwing an overweight passenger overboard because his ship was leaking.</p>
<p>It was difficult to immediately predict what Chirac would offer the public, many of whom are angry at him for having rowed back on campaign promises to cut unemployment and lower taxes.</p>
<p>Chirac's mentor, the late General Charles de Gaulle, during crises which marked his 1958-1969 period in office, regularly laid his job on the line during referendums or key elections, threatening to quit unless the public gave him its backing.</p>
<p>Whether Chirac might try to emulate him remains an open question. The last time de Gaulle tried the ploy was in 1969, in a referendum over decentralisation.</p>
<p>He lost and left office the next morning.  REUTER  262229 GMT may 97</p>
