<p>Speculation about a looming takeover bid for Swiss insurer Winterthur looks set to be a feature of coming weeks after two groups said they had significant stakes in it, analysts and traders said on Friday.</p>
<p>The news revived speculation on an impending reshuffle among Swiss insurers or banks or both, rumours that have repeatedly erupted in the past three months on the bullish Swiss bourse.</p>
<p>Winterthur, whose shares shot up more than 7.5 percent from Monday through Thursday, closed on Friday down 20 Swiss francs or 1.4 percent at 1,418 after trading in a band betwen 1,401 and 1,474.</p>
<p>"Winterthur is the kind of medium-sized company that could interest a lot of big companies in Europe," said analyst Jean-Christian Huard from Societe General in Paris.</p>
<p>"It is well-managed but maybe not completely efficient and return on equity could be better with a more efficient, more pushy management," he said.</p>
<p>Winterthur had premium income of 13.07 billion francs ($9 billion) in 1996 and reported a net attributable profit of 506.7 million.</p>
<p>The spotlight was on Winterthur again after Swiss financier Martin Ebner said his BK Group had raised its Winterthur stake from 14.5 percent in mid-May to 18.3 percent at June 30. Customers of his BZ Bank held another five percent, he said.</p>
<p>Ebner also said Swiss Reinsurance Company, which sold its direct insurance business in 1994, held around five percent of Winterthur. Swiss Re later confirmed this.</p>
<p>In a strange twist, Ebner discovered the information on Swiss Re's stake from a letter that Winterthur sent to the BK Group. Winterthur later acknowledged that it had sent the information by mistake.</p>
<p>The letter, which Ebner showed to journalists, acknowledged BK's request for registration of newly bought Winterthur shares but then went on to say that Swiss Re, an unrelated company, had reached the five percent limit on voting rights.</p>
<p>The letter's news set off a flurry of statements by the companies involved aimed at dampening speculation centred on Swiss Re and its powerful ally Credit Suisse Group, one of Switzerland's three biggest bank groups.</p>
<p>"I have heard absolutely nothing about a move like this, a takeover offer for Winterthur from Swiss Re or CS," Winterthur chairman Peter Spaelti told Swiss radio DRS.</p>
<p>Swiss Re would only confirm that it had a stake of around five percent in Winterthur. "We have had this for a long time," spokesman Otto Kern said, declining to go into more detail.</p>
<p>CS Group said it did not have a strategic stake in Winterthur but held well below five percent of Winterthur through its investment funds and internal pension fund.</p>
<p>Asked to define strategic, Credit Suisse Group spokesman Andre-Lou Sugar said he meant an equity holding taken with the intent of linking two businesses.</p>
<p>"For example, about two years ago we sold 20 percent of equity in Credit Suisse Financial Products to Swiss Re. That was a strategic stake," he said.</p>
<p>As for the BK Group, Ebner was tight-lipped about his plans, repeatedly declining to answer reporters' questions about whether he wanted a higher share or if he had been among buyers who pushed up the Winterthur price this week.</p>
<p>Speculation dating to April that CS might want Winterthur was dismissed by some analysts as too adventurous. Others noted that German insurer Allianz had taken over two smaller Swiss insurers, Elvia and Berner, in the past two years.</p>
<p>"You can think of three or four big European insurers that might be interested, such as Allianz, Generali or ING . Or there are several big American insurers who are not yet present in Europe," Huard said.</p>
<p>But he said he thought the rumours were more speculative than real, adding that Winterthur's five-percent cap on voting rights added to the difficulty of taking over the company.</p>
