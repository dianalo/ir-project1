<p>Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Tuesday criticised the U.S. strikes on Iraq, suggesting they were prompted by U.S. domestic political considerations in the run-up to the presidential elections in November.</p>
<p>The attacks early on Tuesday "cannot be supported by anyone at all, except those who put domestic politics including pre-electoral questions above all else," Primakov told a news conference in the Swiss capital.</p>
<p>Primakov said it was essential to "exclude the use of force in international affairs" and expressed hope that the U.S. attacks would not be repeated.</p>
<p>"The world is increasingly convinced that this is not the way to solve problems, especially the sort that exist in the north of Iraq," he declared.</p>
<p>The Russian foreign minister -- speaking at the same time as U.S. President Clinton defended the military strikes in a televised speech -- said that in the long term, the U.S. action could have serious, negative results across the whole region.</p>
<p>"Whether they want it or not, such actions can only encourage separatism in the north of Iraq among the Kurds, which no one wants. It does not suit anyone and could destabilise the situation in the region," Primakov said. "It could also make solution of the Middle East problem between Israel and the Arabs more difficult and lead to other negative results. I hope this action will not be repeated and that good sense will prevail."</p>
