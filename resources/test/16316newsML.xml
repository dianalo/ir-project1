<p>Russian troops will restart their withdrawal from the Chechen capital Grozny on Wednesday after Moscow commanders and separatist rebels sorted out a conflict over the seizure of a Russian convoy.</p>
<p>In Moscow, peacemaker Alexander Lebed, who struck a military deal with rebel chief-of-staff Aslan Maskhadov last week, is waiting for President Boris Yeltsin to consider his plan to solve political aspects of the 20-month war.</p>
<p>Maskhadov and Russia's top commander in Chechnya Vyacheslav Tikhomirov said on Tuesday they had finally agreed on all details of the military deal signed last Thursday.</p>
<p>"There will be no more obstacles to the continuation of our task," Tikhomirov told reporters after talks in the village of Novye Atagi, 20 km (12 miles) south of Grozny .</p>
<p>The deal, which provides for a truce and Russian withdrawal from Grozny and southern regions of Chechnya, had been delayed after a group of Chechens disarmed a Russian column on Saturday.</p>
<p>But Tikhomirov said the seizure of the weapons would no longer block the deal.</p>
<p>Tikhomirov said the pullout of Russian troops from some districts of southern Chechnya, which has continued since Sunday, would be completed on Tuesday. Other districts would be free of Russian troops by Wednesday or Thursday.</p>
<p>Both sides said the truce was broadly holding.</p>
<p>Lebed, whom Yeltsin had ordered to restore peace in Chechnya, followed the military deal with talks aimed at solving political aspects of the conflict in which tens of thousands people died.</p>
<p>On Sunday Lebed abruptly broke off talks with rebel commanders and flew to Moscow to get support for his peace plans. But Yeltsin, who had offered his general backing in a phone call on Friday, has seemed unwilling to meet him.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency quoted Lebed's spokesman as saying that documents outlining a "comprehensive plan" and an account of Lebed's weekend talks with separatist leaders had been passed to Yeltsin.</p>
<p>Lebed's aide said on Tuesday that Yeltsin, on holiday outside Moscow, would possibly meet his security chief or talk to him by telephone.</p>
<p>The Kremlin could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, 65, who has given Lebed sweeping but undisclosed powers in Chechnya, has not seen him in person for weeks.</p>
<p>Lebed has disclosed no details of a possible deal to end the 20-month war which had killed tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>But Interfax quoted "well informed sources" as saying that under the plan the decision on the most painful issue of the conflict -- whether Chechnya should become independent as the rebels want or remain part of Russia -- would be put off until the region recovers from the war.</p>
<p>Yeltsin's slowness in meeting Lebed has prompted speculation that the president, who sent troops to crush Chechnya's bid for secession in December 1994, could be too unwell to deal with the matter or that he was waiting to see if Lebed succeeded.</p>
<p>"Boris Yeltsin has decided definitively to distance himself from the activities of Alexander Lebed in Chechnya until events there reach a final phase," Sevodnya newspaper said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Yeltsin has been seen twice on television since he was reelected in July, fuelling rumours that two heart attacks last year have weakened his grip on affairs of state.</p>
<p>Aides have dismissed such speculation, insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign.</p>
