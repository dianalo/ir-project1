<p>One airman was rescued and several bodies were spotted after a U.S. Air Force Reserve transport plane with 11 people on board crashed into the Pacific Ocean off California, officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Air Force said the HC-130 Hercules crashed on Friday night after the crew reported engine and electrical problems. It was flying from an air base in Portland, Oregon, to San Diego, California, on a routine training mission.</p>
<p>Coast Guard officials said wreckage from the plane was strewn over a wide area of the ocean, about 60 miles (95 km) off Cape Mendocino on the northern California coast.</p>
<p>Coast Guard and military planes and ships were searching throughout the night and officials said they had not given up hope of finding more survivors.</p>
<p>Sgt. Robert Vogel, a 31-year-old airborne communications specialist from Albany, Oregon, was rescued by the Coast Guard on Friday night and flown to a California hospital where he was listed in stable condition, the Air Force said. The other 10 on board were listed as missing, it said.</p>
<p>Lt. Joe Pesci from the U.S. Coast Guard Air Station in Sacramento, California, which sent a C-130 to help in the search and rescue efforts, said rescuers had spotted several bodies near the debris but had not yet been able to recover them.</p>
<p>Pesci said two Coast Guard and two Air Force helicopters were taking part in the search along with a Coast Guard C- 130. A Coast Guard cutter had arrived at the scene and another cutter was on its way along with a Navy frigate, he said. A merchant ship was also diverted to help in the search, Coast Guard officials said.</p>
<p>Coast Guard officials said the crew's chances of survival were better than an average person's because they were trained in survival techniques and wore flight suits that would help keep them warm in the cold water.</p>
<p>Pesci said it was possible some crew members could have bailed out before the crash, which would increase the size of the search area, although rescuers would not know that until it got light.</p>
<p>Before the crash, crew members reported they had shut down one engine and they had electrical problems, Air Force spokeswoman Karole Scott said from Portland, where the aircraft was based. Soon afterward, air traffic controllers in Oakland and Seattle lost radar and radio contact, she said.</p>
<p>Pesci said the crew had said it planned to turn toward land for a precautionary landing just before contact was lost.</p>
<p>The plane was assigned to the 939th Rescue Wing's 304th Rescue Squadron, the Air Force said. In war, the unit's mission is combat rescue behind enemy lines, Scott said.</p>
<p>The Air Force said it would not release names of other crew members until their families had been notified.</p>
<p>Scott said the Air Force would convene an accident board to investigate the cause of the crash.</p>
