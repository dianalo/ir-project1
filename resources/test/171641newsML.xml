<p>A federal judge in Florida has issued a ruling allowing the Securities and Exchange Commission to collect about $63 million in penalties from convicted stock manipulator Paul Bilzerian, the agency said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The ruling, issued Oct. 22, reversed and remanded to bankruptcy court a summary judgment against an SEC motion seeking to collect the penalties after Bilzerian's bankruptcy court case is resolved.</p>
<p>The SEC had asked the bankruptcy court to rule that the penalties were not "dischargeable" in the bankruptcy case, but the bankruptcy court ruled against the agency, saying the agency failed to prove its fraud case.</p>
<p>Judith Starr, SEC assistant litigation counsel, said the agency appealed, contending it had proved material misrepresentation and fraud against the market in the case.</p>
<p>Judge Steven Merryday, the district judge for the U.S. Middle District Court in Florida granted the appeal.</p>
<p>The SEC had filed civil securities fraud charges against Bilzerian in 1989 stemming from his unsuccessful takeover attempts or undisclosed investments in Cluett, Peabody &amp; Co., Hammermill Paper Co., H.H. Robertson Co. and Armco Inc. from 1985 to 1988.</p>
<p>Bilzerian, former chairman of Singer Co. NV, filed for bankruptcy in 1991.</p>
<p>In June last year, the District Court cleared the way for the SEC to file a claim against Bilzerian in the bankruptcy case. That ruling came after two bankruptcy court rulings that the agency lacked standing as a creditor to bring a claim against Bilzerian in the bankruptcy case.</p>
<p>The SEC originally sought a penalty of $33 million. The amount has ballooned to more than $60 million because of prejudgment interest, Starr said.</p>
<p>Bilzerian was previously convicted of criminal securities fraud charges and was sentenced to four years in prison and fined $1.5 million. The sentence was later reduced to 20 months.</p>
<p>Starr said Bilzerian can still appeal the district court's ruling. Bilzerian is not represented by counsel in the bankruptcy case, Starr said.</p>
<p>If the SEC's case is upheld, it can collect from him by garnishing his salary or going after his remaining assets, Starr said.</p>
<p>Starr said Bilzerian was known to be working as a consultant for a Utah company. He was also known to be seeking a tax refund in claims court amounting to about $8 million to $9 million in connection with an unrelated case, Starr said.</p>
<p>Bilzerian could not be reached for comment.</p>
