<p>Women could hold the key to Britain's May 1 election but opinion polls published on Monday show that more than 30 percent are still undecided how to vote.</p>
<p>A MORI survey for the Fawcett Society, which campaigns for equality between the sexes, found that nearly one in three women were floating voters, compared to 25 percent of men, and most women did not trust any of the main political parties.</p>
<p>"There is clear evidence to show that women voters have decided the outcome of British elections since 1945," Fawcett spokeswoman Maryann Stephenson said in an interview.</p>
<p>"It is going to be one of the deciding factors (in this election) because there are nearly two million more eligible women voters than men."</p>
<p>The Fawcett poll of 2,000 British men and women at the end of February found that most undecided women voters thought politicians were out of touch and untrustworthy.</p>
<p>A broader survey for the Women's Communication Centre, which campaigns to promote female perspectives in political debate, interviewed 10,000 women last year. It's findings showed that most women felt the ruling Conservatives and the opposition Labour and Liberal Democrats were ignoring their views.</p>
<p>Issues such as the environment, work concerns, child care and maternity leave and equal pay for the sexes were not being addressed.</p>
<p>"This is an opportunity for any of the parties to take the initiative. Any party that did might fare very well," said Centre's director Sue Tibballs.</p>
<p>Since he called the May 1 election last Monday, starting Britain's longest campaign in more than 70 years, Prime Minister John Major has been battling sleaze allegations against 10 Conservative members of parliament.</p>
<p>Major's decision to announce the election last week and close parliament on Monday means a report into the allegations cannnot be published before the election unless the government, in an extraordinary climb-down, recalls the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Conservative MP Richard Shepherd broke ranks on Sunday and urged Major to do just that.</p>
<p>"I'm sure the prime minister doesn't want his campaign to be bogged down in the torrent of abuse that's now heaped on him personally, but on the whole system as well," he told GMTV.</p>
<p>"I think this should be stopped in the bud straight away."</p>
<p>The two parties have also been squabbling over the format of a televised debate between Major and opposition leader Tony Blair, whose Labour Party has amassed a 25.5 lead in the latest opinion poll.</p>
<p>Although Conservative Party chairman Brian Mawhinney said he has agreed to the basic principles, his party still insists on a two-man debate between Major and Blair with no audience participation.</p>
<p>Labour wants Paddy Ashdown of the minority Liberal Democrats to be included and says the candidates should answer questions from the audience.</p>
