<p>China's unpredictable shopping sprees keep traders in raw materials on their toes.</p>
<p>With 1.2 billion people and a burgeoning economy, any Chinese foray into world commodity markets can have a huge impact.</p>
<p>Baffling to Westerners is the way that these movements do not always seem to follow basic rules of supply and demand, traders say.</p>
<p>"China is not really driven by normal market forces. If it was, you could at least try to monitor prices to guess its likely demands," said one.</p>
<p>Latest to have been taken by surprise was the shipping market, where freight rates suddenly soared by 50 percent.</p>
<p>The Baltic Freight Index, a daily index of rates on key dry cargo routes, had plummeted to its lowest in a decade in September on the back of a bumper wheat harvest in China.</p>
<p>It looked as if fewer vessels would be needed to ship grain to Asia. Then the Chinese suddenly bought an unexpectedly large volume of American soybeans and fertilisers.</p>
<p>"People who felt the market was weak suddenly found that they had to scratch around to cover requirements," said John Banaszkiewicz at brokerage CIS in London.</p>
<p>"The Chinese have taken over as a major force in the freight market...they have taken over as the major importer and exporter of raw materials," Banaszkiewicz said.</p>
<p>"SWING FACTOR" IN BASE METAL MARKETS</p>
<p>In base metal markets China is a key "swing factor", with annual consumption of refined copper often outpacing its ability to mine and smelt its own metal.</p>
<p>Industry specialists Bloomsbury Minerals Economics (BME) estimated that China will need 1.3 million tonnes of copper this year, but the country will produce only 1.07 million tonnes.</p>
<p>The balance has to come from its own stocks, which are opaque, as China has commercial inventories and strategic stores. Or, the Chinese buy from a tightly-balanced market.</p>
<p>Despite intense international interest, much of what China does in raw materials trading is still shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>Some traders try to gauge China's likely demand on the basis of changes in infrastructure, tax regulations and monetary policies.</p>
<p>China is seen trying to shift labour power to cities from farms in a drive for modernisation which could diminish its exports of raw materials and boost imports.</p>
<p>"It is very difficult for the population in the countryside to move away but as infrastructure and transportation improves, China is going to be more of a deficit country," said an analyst with an international trading firm.</p>
<p>LARGEST WHEAT IMPORTER</p>
<p>China is the largest importer of wheat.</p>
<p>It has stopped issuing quotas for imports following its bumper grain harvest and might not reconsider them until April 1997, traders in Hong Kong, China and Singapore have reported.</p>
<p>Traders expect this to add to pressure on wheat prices which were already falling after bumper harvests around the world.</p>
<p>"But it may just be an excuse for the Chinese to get the price down," said one trader.</p>
<p>Another noted that China has seen a sharp rise in wheat demand under a government drive to produce more meat.</p>
<p>China's monetary policies are often reflected in import and export policies.</p>
<p>"The government is very concerned about keeping control over the rate of econmomic growth," a trader said.</p>
<p>A change in per capita income has a significant effect on food demand because a high percentage of the Chinese salary is spent on food, he added.</p>
<p>CHANGE FROM PRODUCER TO NET IMPORTER</p>
<p>China has swung from being a producer country to a net importer in many commodities including wheat and soybeans, he said, and a seemingly insatiable demand for soybean meal -- used to feed livestock -- is underpinning world prices.</p>
<p>Traders say the Chinese were expected to import 1.1 million tonnes in 1996 and one bullish trader forecasts an import need for 2.5 million in 1997.</p>
<p>Christopher Pack, an analyst at Czarnikow Sugar, predicts China would import around 1.5 million tonnes of sugar in 1997.</p>
<p>"But it could move a large amount either way," Pack said.</p>
<p>Sugar consumption is gaining momentum as soft drinks and confectionary manufacturers spring up across China.</p>
<p>The Coca-Cola company said in October it had begun construction of a $30 million bottling plant in the southwestern city of Chengdu, its 23rd in China.</p>
<p>Coffee industry leaders at the World Coffee Conference in Hamburg in September discussed tactics to promote a change of allegiance in China to their brew from tea.</p>
<p>One estimate was that coffee consumption in China could rise by the year 2005 to seven million 60 kg (132 lb) bags from the present 200,000.</p>
<p>Swiss food maker Nestle's range of instant coffee, chocolate and sugar-based confectionary is being produced in China.</p>
<p>Volatility in the Chinese internal prices is usually a result of supply rather than demand, a trader said, referring to factors such as natural disasters and production problems.</p>
<p>"But China's demand is just as volatile as its supply."</p>
<p>"China is a mystery."</p>
