<p>Wholesale prices fell for a record sixth straight month in June as food costs plunged, the government said on Friday in another sign the economy enjoys the best of all worlds -- solid growth with low inflation.</p>
<p>The 0.1 percent drop in producer prices last month followed a 0.3 percent decline in May. Prices paid to producers of goods ranging from beef to books declined.</p>
<p>"It is time to call in Sherlock Holmes, for we now have the case of the missing inflation," said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Charlotte, N.C.-based bankers First Union Corp., referring to the fictional English detective.</p>
<p>Excluding volatile food and energy costs, wholesale prices rose 0.1 percent last month after a 0.3 percent fall in May.</p>
<p>Analysts said the absence of inflationary pressures should help convince the Federal Reserve to continue to keep interest rates steady. Central bank policy-makers next meet to map monetary strategy on Aug. 19.</p>
<p>"This favourable price performance leaves the Fed in a watchful, waiting stance," said David Jones, vice chairman of Wall Street broker Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.</p>
<p>Wall Street stock and bond prices gained as investors were encouraged by the producer price report.</p>
<p>Analysts said producers of everything from grains to computers were having difficulty raising prices because of stiff competition, particularly from overseas. The strength of the dollar has also helped, by holding down prices of imported goods. So, too, has increased worker productivity.</p>
<p>"There has been a sea change in pricing behaviour," said Paul Huard, senior vice president at the National Association of Manufacturers. "For the forseeable future, inflation is dead. The Fed should not increase interest rates at least for the rest of 1997."</p>
<p>The steady decline in producer prices is likely to fuel speculation that the U.S. economy has entered a new era in which it can grow strongly without generating inflation, thanks to globalization and technological advance.</p>
<p>"The relationship between economic growth and inflation perhaps has been altered, although I don't think it has been eliminated," said Kevin Flanagan, vice president of Wall Street broker Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</p>
<p>Economists generally expect wholesale prices to remain tame in the coming months. Huard said that companies built up $30 billion worth of inventories in the first quarter and will need to keep prices down to sell those stocks off.</p>
<p>"Over the next six to eight months, I expect some stirring (in prices)," said Oscar Gonzalez, an economist at John Hancock Financial Services in Boston. "But it should be nothing to cause alarm and not a precursor of a surge upward."</p>
<p>The June decline in wholesale prices was paced by a steep 0.9 percent drop in food costs.</p>
<p>The drop in food prices was broad-based, with prices for beef, veal, pork, poultry, fish and vegetables all lower. Prices for fresh fruits and melons tumbled by more than 15 percent, their biggest decline in more than six months.</p>
<p>Energy costs turned up last month, rising by 0.7 percent, after declining steadily for much of this year. Gasoline prices rose unexpectedly, although heating oil costs dropped, by nearly 6 percent.</p>
<p>Prices of a variety of other products also rose modestly last month. Car prices increased by 0.3 percent, tobacco gained 0.1 percent and alcoholic beverage prices were up 0.5 percent. Computer prices, which have been falling steadily, also rose in June, by 0.6 percent, after a steep drop in May.</p>
<p>The producer price report showed there is little in the way of inflation in the pipeline.</p>
<p>Prices of intermediate goods, which are used to make finished wholesale products, were unchanged in June.</p>
<p>Prices of crude goods, or materials at the start of the production process, fell by 3.3 percent. Crude oil prices fell by more than 14 percent, the biggest decline in 2-1/2 years.</p>
