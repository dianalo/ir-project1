<p>ICI Pakistan Ltd, a subsidiary of ICI Plc, said on Tuesday it intends to enter into a joint venture agreement with U.S.-based DuPont Co for a pure terephthalic acid (PTA) plant in Karachi.</p>
<p>DuPont on Monday picked up a 50 percent stake in ICI Pakistan as part of a global deal to buy half of ICI Plc's bulk chemical business for $3 billion.</p>
<p>"In order to ensure retention of this very critical strength and assure the continued stability, competitiveness and future growth of the PTA business, ICI Pakistan intends to enter into a 50-50 joint venture with DuPont," said Munnawar Hamid, chief executive of ICI Pakistan.</p>
<p>Hamid said in a statement the joint venture proposal will be considered for approval by the board of directors of ICI Pakistan in its meeting on August 12.</p>
<p>"In proceeding further ICI Pakistan will ensure the best interest of all its shareholders," he added.</p>
<p>ICI Pakistan, listed on the Karachi Stock Exchange with paid up capital of 7.871 billion rupees ($193.77 million), is currently owned 61 percent by ICI Plc. It manufactures polyester staple fibre, soda ash, paints, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, explosives, some consumer items and other speciality chemicals.</p>
<p>ICI had planned to start commercial production at its $450 million PTA plant being constructed near Karachi's Port Qasim by November 1997.</p>
<p>The plant will manufacture 400,000 tonnes of PTA, a raw material used in making polyester staple fibre, to be sold in Pakistan and abroad.</p>
<p>"The joint venture proposal is based on and underpins ICI Plc UK's continued long term interest in retaining its traditional strategic position in Pakistan and its commitment to support strategies which enable growth, in line with market opportunities, in all ICI Pakistan businesses," Hamid said.</p>
<p>ICI Pakistan's 10-rupee shares closed 1.0 rupee higher at 27.50 on Monday on news of the acquisition of ICI businesses by DuPont.</p>
