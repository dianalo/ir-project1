<p>UOP, a partnership between Allied Signal Inc and Union Carbide Corp, is hoping to maintain its revenue growth of 10 percent in 1997, a senior company official said on Friday.  </p>
<p>"We have been growing at better than 10 percent as a company...(we) want to keep that growth on track," Richard Wilmoth, UOP's managing director in Asia said at the opening of its Singapore office.</p>
<p>UOP, a supplier and licenser of technologies to oil and gas related industries saw 1996 revenues of over U.S.$1 billion.</p>
<p>The company said the Asia-Pacific region which contributes around half of its revenue will be the big growth area.</p>
