<headline>NBA BASKETBALL-JORDAN SCORES 45 AS BULLS BEAT SONICS IN FINALS REMATCH.</headline>
<dateline>SEATTLE 1997-02-02</dateline>
<text>
<p>Michael Jordan scored 45 points and his Chicago Bulls sent a message to the Seattle SuperSonics with an emphatic 91-84 victory Sunday in their first meeting since last year's NBA Finals.</p>
<p>Again playing without suspended NBA rebounding leader Dennis Rodman, the defending champion Bulls improved to 20-4 on the road and 41-5 overall, both league bests.</p>
<p>They also snapped a three-game losing streak in Seattle and improved to 4-0 on their West Coast swing.</p>
<p>"We're still a good team without Dennis and we can still contend for a championship without Dennis," Jordan said.</p>
<p>Jordan (19-of-28 from the field) blistered a series of defenders including Defensive Player of the Year Gary Payton.</p>
<p>"When we cut it to two, he made two incredible jump shots," Seattle coach George Karl said. "There's no way you can say, 'Defend him better.'"</p>
<p>The Sonics were held to a season low in points. Payton had 24, Shawn Kemp 16 and Detlef Schrempf 14.</p>
<p>At Los Angeles, Shaquille O'Neal scored 24 points before straining his right knee as the Lakers set season highs for points in a quarter, half and game in a 129-99 rout of the Washington Bullets, their sixth straight win.</p>
<p>The Lakers scored 46 points in the first quarter and 78 points in the first half.</p>
<p>Eddie Jones scored 18 points and Nick Van Exel added 17 for the Lakers, who moved two games ahead of second-place Seattle in the Pacific Division and tied Miami for the league's second-best record (34-12) behind Chicago (41-5).</p>
<p>In New York, Glen Rice, who averaged 32 points a game in January, began February with 40 points to lead the Charlotte Hornets to a 99-93 victory over the Knicks.</p>
<p>Rice, who has averaged 37 points in his last four games, hit 12-of-20 from the field, including 4-of-5 from three-point range, and 12-of-15 free throws.</p>
<p>"It's total confidence. I feel I can do no wrong. Wherever I shoot the ball, it's going in," he said.</p>
<p>The loss snapped the 15-game home winning streak of the Knicks, who were without centre Patrick Ewing (strained groin) for a second game. John Starks led New York with 26 points.</p>
<p>In Orlando, Rony Seikaly scored 29 points as the surging Magic raced to a 103-90 victory over the shorthanded Houston Rockets, who lost their fourth straight.</p>
<p>The Magic have won seven of their last eight games.</p>
<p>Kevin Willis had a season-high 23 points and 16 rebounds but Hakeem Olajuwon was limited to 17 points for the Rockets, whose Midwest Division lead over the Utah Jazz was cut to one-half game.</p>
<p>Houston welcomed back All-Star guard Clyde Drexler, who had 12 points, eight rebounds and five assists after missing two games with a strained hamstring. But All-Star forward Charles Barkley sat out his third straight game and seventh in the last eight with a sprained ankle.</p>
<p>At Detroit, the Phoenix Suns salvaged the finale of a five-game road trip with a 106-97 upset of the Pistons, who had a five-game winning streak snapped.</p>
<p>Mark Bryant scored 21 points and Cedric Ceballos and Wesley Person 18 each for the Suns, who ended a six-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Otis Thorpe scored a season-high 27 points and Grant Hill added 17 for the Pistons.</p>
<p>In Miami, ex-Cavalier John Crotty scored eight of his 13 points in the fourth quarter as the Heat rallied for an 80-76 win over Cleveland, sweeping the home-and-home series.</p>
<p>Tim Hardaway scored 20 points and Alonzo Mourning 15 for the Heat, who have won four in a row and nine of their last 11. Cleveland has lost 11 of 14.</p>
<p>At Indiana, Travis Best hit the go-ahead three-pointer with 42 seconds left and Derrick McKey blocked a pair of shots by Kendall Gill in the final 27 seconds as the Pacers erased a 20-point deficit in a 92-90 victory over the New Jersey Nets.</p>
<p>Indiana's Reggie Miller 28 points. Gill led the Nets with 32 points.</p>
<p>In Denver, Dale Ellis scored 21 points as the Nuggets cooled off former teammate Dikembe Mutombo and the Atlanta Hawks, 115-104.</p>
<p>Mark Jackson scored 17 points and Antonio McDyess added 16 for Denver, which never trailed after the first two minutes and won for just the seventh time in their last 20 games.</p>
<p>Mookie Blaylock scored 29 points and Eldridge Recasner 23 for the Hawks, who had won 14 of their last 16 games.</p>
<p>At Minnesota, Tom Gugliotta had 27 points as the Timberwolves held off a furious rally for a 103-102 victory over the Portland Trail Blazers.</p>
<p>The Timberwolves managed just their second win in their last 19 meetings with Portland.</p>
<p>Kenny Anderson had 26 points and Gary Trent matched his career high with 24 for the Blazers, 0-4 on their road trip.</p>
<p>In Boston, Bryant Reeves had a career-high 33 points and 18 rebounds and rookie Shareef Abdur-Rahim scored 28 points to lead the Vancouver Grizzlies to a 102-92 victory over the Celtics in a game between the two worst teams in the NBA.</p>
<p>The Grizzlies snapped an eight-game losing streak and improved the league's worst record to 9-40. The loss was the eighth in nine games for the Celtics (10-33).</p>
