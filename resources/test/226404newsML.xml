<headline>Israeli Arab says border policeman beat him.</headline>

<p>An Israeli Arab said on Friday he had been clubbed and beaten by a border policeman in the latest in a string of incidents of alleged Israeli police brutality against Arabs.</p>
<p>An amateur video broadcast worldwide last week showing two Israeli policemen beating Palestinians at a West Bank checkpoint placed abuse of Arabs by the paramilitary border police who patrol Israel, the West Bank and Gaza, under close scrutiny.</p>
<p>Nasser Tarabiyeh said he was clubbed with a pistol during a dispute with a policeman near the Arab town of Sakhnin in northern Israel last week.</p>
<p>"He hit me on the head with his pistol...on the head, all over my body, arms and back. I was dealt all sorts of violence," Tarabiyeh told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>He said the policeman, also an Israeli Arab, fired two shots from his pistol before fleeing when a passerby approached.</p>
<p>The radio said the border policeman was under investigation by a Justice Ministry department which probes police misdeeds.</p>
<p>Israeli police and justice ministry officials were not available for immediate comment.</p>
<p>An Israeli court this week charged the two policemen captured on videotape with aggravated assault and abuse of authority. Four other border police were charged this week with beating a Palestinian unconscious after detaining him last June.</p>
<p>Israel's attorney-general said on Wednesday police brutality against Palestinians was "severe and widespread".</p>
<p>Some 800,000 Arabs live in Israel. Israel granted citizenship to those Arabs who did not flee their towns and villages during the 1948 Middle East war.</p>
