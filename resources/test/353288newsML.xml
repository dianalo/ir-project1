<p>Chartwell Leisure Inc said on Tuesday it had a net loss of $14.5 million, or $1.47 per share, on revenues of $26.9 million for the fourth quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>For full-year 1996, Chartwell had a net loss of $30.1 million, or $4.04 per share, on revenues of $89.0 million.</p>
<p>The company did not provide 1995 figures for comparison. It said it was entirely a gaming company that year but switched in 1996 to the lodging business, so no comparison would be meaningful.</p>
