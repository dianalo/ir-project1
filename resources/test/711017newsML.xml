<p>ChiRex Inc, a pharmaceutical contract manufacturer, said Monday that it has signed a letter of intent to buy Glaxo Wellcome's GMP pharmaceutical production facility at Annan, Scotland.</p>
<p>As part of the proposed deal, Glaxo Wellcome will award ChiRex a five year contract of up to $450 million, of which $250 million is guaranteed, to supply certain pharmaceutical intermediates and active ingredients.  </p>
<p>Chirex said the sale is expected to close later this year, and it anticipates retaining a substantial majority of the 170 employees currently employed at the facility.</p>
<p>It said it will continue to manufacture products currently made at Annan and plans to invest approximately $48 million over five years to accommodate newly contracted products and to modify the facility for general purpose manufacturing.</p>
<p>It intends to use senior bank debt as a source of capital for the facility purchase and modification, it said.</p>
<p>"This agreement is of major strategic importance to ChiRex," said Alan R. Clark, chairman and chief executive officer of ChiRex, who added that the deal "significantly expands our production capacity, and ensures a major revenue stream into the next decade."</p>
