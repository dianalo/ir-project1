<p>Swedish appliance maker Electrolux on Tuesday posted a 14 percent fall in earnings for the first quarter and promised no relief in its depressed traditional markets.</p>
<p>The company posted a profit of 777 million crowns ($99.6 million) after one-time items for the first three months of the year compared to the same 1996 period. It said sales rose 4 percent to 28.72 million crowns ($3.68 million).</p>
<p>"So far this year we have faced a very difficult market situation in Europe, with lower demand in almost all product areas," said Electrolux Managing Director Leif Johansson in a written copy of his exit speech.</p>
<p>Johansson, who is leaving Electrolux to take over at Swedish vehicle maker AB Volvo, said the European white goods, or heavy household appliances, market shrank 3 percent in the first quarter.</p>
<p>"The North American market has, however, been more stable but with a slight fall in demand for white goods compared with the first quarter of last year," he added.</p>
<p>Johansson will be replaced by Michael Treschow, who had been chief executive of industrial engineering company Atlas Copco and is known in markets as a cost-cutter with a focus on shareholder value.</p>
<p>Average market expectations put the first quarter profit after financial items at 910 million crowns ($116 million).</p>
<p>The news sent the stock tumbling 16 crowns ($2.05), or 3.4 percent, to 457 crowns ($58.56), but it recovered a little later in the day.</p>
<p>The company said it would focus on improving logistics and marketing in order to make the operation less fragmented.</p>
<p>Both the U.S. and European white goods markets, which make up the backbone of the company's sales, have contracted, it said.</p>
<p>The company also said lower sales volumes and a less favourable product mix hurt the group's European operations.</p>
