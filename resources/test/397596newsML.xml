<p>Bosnia's Moslem-Croat federation and Serb republic are drawing up separate privatisation laws that directly undermine the unity of the country, the Bosnian co-prime minister said in an interview.</p>
<p>Haris Silajdzic, the central government's Moslem co-chairman, said the state of Bosnia-Hercegovina, not its two entities, should inherit the assets of Yugoslavia's former republic and therefore, regulate privatisation.</p>
<p>Bosnia emerged from a 43-month war as one country but was effectively split into two territories that include a Moslem-Croat federation spread over 51 percent of the territory and a Serb republic controlling the rest.</p>
<p>The country has a small central government consisting of a cabinet, parliament and a three-man presidency comprised of Moslems, Serbs and Croats. But diplomats say the joint institutions have been virtually paralysed because Serb representatives remain opposed to a unified state.</p>
<p>How the privatisation issue is resolved could determine whether Bosnia survives as a single state or permanently divides into Serb and Moslem-Croat territories, Silajdzic said.</p>
<p>"If the entities are in charge of this (privatisation), it would lead us to have two incompatible economic systems and eventually, the dissolution of Bosnia-Hercegovina."</p>
<p>Bosnian Serb authorities say they have the right to pursue their own privatisation programme.</p>
<p>And officials from the Moslem-Croat federation argue it is better to press ahead rather than wait for the inter-ethnic central government to work out an agreement.</p>
<p>Haggling between federation and Serb officials would waste valuable time and delay possible foreign investment, they say.</p>
<p>"It would be good to have a state privatisation law, but there is no chance to adopt it at the central level right now," former federation prime minister, Hasan Muratovic told a Sarajevo newspaper last week.</p>
<p>But Silajdzic said "does such a hasty decision solve anything or create long-term economic chaos?"</p>
<p>The International Crisis Group (ICG), a private agency monitoring the peace process, supported Silajdzic's views in an analysis of the succession issue. ICG based its conclusions on international law and recent practices applied afer the break-up of the former Czechoslavia and Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Only states, not autonomous provinces, posess the necessary capacity to succeed the rights and obligations of the predecessor state, ICG said in a report issued two days ago.</p>
<p>Separate legislation could create a legal morass for foreign investors, damage Bosnian companies with assets in both entities and open the way to nationalist discrimination against property owners, Silajdzic said.</p>
<p>"Only the state of Bosnia-Hercegovina can regulate this (foreign capital) according to our constitution and not the entities. Who in the outside world would want to deal with two systems?" he said.</p>
<p>Silajdzic proposed a compromise solution that outlines basic principles for privatisation, restitution and ownership and offered it to the entities. But so far, they have refused to budge, he said.</p>
<p>The international High Represenative to Bosnia, Carl Bildt, may ultimately settle the issue.</p>
<p>For Silajdzic, the dispute goes to the heart of the 1995 peace treaty, which called for preserving Bosnia as a single state. "If that is the wish here, then why did we insist on a unified state?"</p>
