<p>Tribal groups in Indonesia's remote Irian Jaya province have agreed to end clashes around the mining town of Timika after fighting killed four people, a community leader said on Monday.</p>
<p>"They agreed to end the fights on Sunday. The people have agreed to throw away their archer's bow," Tom Beanal, a leader from the Amungme Community Institute (Lemasa), told Reuters from Timika, some 4,000 km (2,500 miles) east of Jakarta.</p>
<p>The clashes were sparked by an attempted robbery or extortion last Wednesday involving Amungme and Dani tribesmen in the Kwamki Lama district, five km (three miles) north of Timika.</p>
<p>Beanal said two other tribes, the Nduga and the Damal, were also involved in the clashes, which lasted for three days. The last clash was on Saturday in which many people were reported to have been wounded.</p>
<p>"Basically, the fights have ended but there are several things to discuss further before a peace agreement could be reached," said Beanal. He gave no other details.</p>
<p>The official Antara news agency reported on Monday that Irian Jaya military commander Joni Lumintang said the military would not increase the number of troops in the Timika area to contain the violence.</p>
<p>"For the time being, it is not considered necessary to multiply the troops because the existing troops have already been able to handle the violence," Lumintang said without elaborating.</p>
<p>On Sunday Antara, quoting military sources, said three people had died in the clashes, although some residents say up to five had been killed.</p>
<p>In January, six people were killed and more than 60 wounded when thousands of Amungme and Dani tribesman clashed near Tembagapura after an alleged rape.</p>
<p>PT Freeport Indonesia, operator of one of the world's largest copper and gold mines at Tembagapura, about 45 km (28 miles) north of Timika, is 81.28 percent owned by Freeport McMoRan Copper and Gold Inc of the United States. Indonesian interests own the balance.</p>
