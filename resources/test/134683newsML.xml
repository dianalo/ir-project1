<p>UK leisure group Conrad Plc is seen sealing its proposed takeover of Sheffield United Football Club in three to four weeks, when details will be sent to shareholders after due diligence is complete, a senior source close to the company told Reuters.</p>
<p>Conrad confirmed earlier on Tuesday it was in talks with the UK soccer club about the acquisition which is expected to take the form of a reversed takeover with Sheffield floating on the London Stock Exchange. The source said: "Conrad will pay a figure approaching 10 million, but it'll be under 10 million."</p>
