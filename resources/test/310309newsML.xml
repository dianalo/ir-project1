<p>Frenzied buying by speculators and the return of small investors pushed Indian shares higher on Wednesday for the seventh straight day, but analysts were still cautious about future prospects.</p>
<p>"My advice to investors is to look at their portfolios and sell stocks that have risen sharply," said Kayu Mehta, chief investment officer at Tata Investment Corporation. "This is a game of speculation...punters are just pushing up the market."</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the top 30-share index of the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) vaulted 153.47 points, or 4.4 percent, to end at a provisional 3,645.73, off the day's high of 3,673.91.</p>
<p>"There is hectic speculation...the limited supply is giving an opportunity for players to jack up prices," said chief dealer Vijay Pandya at Classic Share &amp; Stock Broking.</p>
<p>The surge, fuelled by government promises to bolster the economy and local markets, had already produced a seven percent jump in the BSE index over the previous six sessions.</p>
<p>Analysts said the rally had prompted scores of speculators to join the buying spree, and this had pushed the market even higher.</p>
<p>"There appears to be a spillover of the excess liquidity in the domestic economy into the stock market. The key driver for that is the higher level of expectations on the government policy front," said Rajashekar Iyer, research head at Kotak Securities, the Indian affiliate of Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>"There is more risk of the market being disappointed by government policy now," Iyer said.</p>
<p>Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda earlier this month said the government was working on policies to pep up industrial growth and dormant capital markets. No details have yet been announced.</p>
<p>Finance Minister P. Chidambaram was expected to present the 1997-98 (April-March) budget to parliament in late February.</p>
<p>Market expectations include measures scrapping a controversial minimum tax for companies introduced in last July's budget.</p>
<p>Some analysts said the bull run had drawn many equity-shy investors back to the markets.</p>
<p>"Markets run on confidence...the most positive factor for this rally is the return of retail investors," said Brij Gopal Daga, chief general managaer (market operations) at Unit Trust of India, the country's biggest investment institution.</p>
<p>Favourable government comments had also led to increased speculation in pivotal stocks, he said.</p>
<p>"There is considerable pressure on the part of authorities to create conducive market conditions," Daga said.</p>
