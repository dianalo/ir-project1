<p>German retailer Karstadt AG said on Tuesday it was reshuffling the board management to put Karl-Heinz Schmidt, head of the lossmaking Hertie store chain, also in charge of the group's medium-sized branches.</p>
<p>Klaus Eierhoff, who had headed the mid-sized store group, moves to lead the group's headquarters in Essen and takes over an efficiency-improvement scheme, Karstadt said in a statement.</p>
<p>Local stores and food outlets chief Heinz Plagge also takes on responsibility for personnel matters in place of Reinhard Koep, who stays in charge of textiles purchasing. Other areas were not affected by the changes, the company said.</p>
