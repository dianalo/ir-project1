<p>A package of government tax reforms sent to parliament this week is likely to delay debate on Ukraine's 1997 budget, a senior parliamentarian said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Vladimir Yemelyanov, deputy chairman of parliament's industry committee, told a news conference the government delivered most of the package on Wednesday but some key bills were still being finalised.</p>
<p>"We have good reasons to send back the draft budget for amendment. How can we deal with this fundamental state law if the tax laws on which it is based have not been passed?" he said.</p>
<p>Among the bills listed by Yemelyanov, a member of the pro-market Reform group in parliament, are amendments to corporate profits tax, to personal income tax, and on payments rules.</p>
<p>Bills on property taxes and value added taxes have still not reached parliament but have been promised in the next few days, Yemelyanov said.</p>
<p>"Considering these documents in standing committees will take at least three weeks," Yemelyanov said, indicating that discussion of the budget itself would have to wait.</p>
<p>He criticised the government's latest budget draft, which includes a deficit agreed with the International Monetary Fund equivalent to 5.8 percent of GDP (4 percent by Western calculations).</p>
<p>"We think that for our economy the deficit should be at a minimum of 10 percent," he said.</p>
<p>Yemelyanov gave no forecast of when the budget might finally pass but another parliamentary official, Viktor Suslov of the Finance committee, said it might be approved in March.</p>
