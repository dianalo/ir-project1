<p>Shareholders of ailing Polish construction company Espebepe SA will vote on May 31 on a new share issue ex-rights, the company said in a statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It gave no other details, but earlier the firm said it planned to increase current share capital by 20 percent and offer the new shares to its creditors, if a debt write-off deal were concluded, at five zlotys each.</p>
<p>Creditors are expected to decide on the deal on May 16, after two previous meetings on March 14 and April 14 failed to reach conclusive decisions on the fate of the company.</p>
<p>Espebepe, with debts of 75 million zlotys, seeks a write-off of 95 percent from its largest creditors, but it has recently indicated it might agree to its largest creditor's debt-restructuring plan.</p>
<p>Pomorski Bank Kredytowy SA (PBKS) wants to write off 40 percent of its debts and to change the remainder into convertible bonds.</p>
<p>The firm had a net loss of 52.1 million zlotys in 1996 and 2.6 million in the first quarter of 1997 and has 2.15 million shares outstanding.</p>
