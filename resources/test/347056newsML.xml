<p>Stokely USA Inc said Friday that the processed vegetable markets have deteriorated recently and the company is still vulnerable to adverse changes.</p>
<p>"During the transition period as we continue to implement our restructuring initiatives, we will continue to be vulnerable to adverse changes in the processed vegetable markets," Stephen Theobald, president and chief executive of Stokely, said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, the markets have deteriorated recently from levels that prevailed during our third quarter," he said.  </p>
<p>Stokely launched a restructuring program of its canned vegetable business in September 1996 and the company said it benefitted from it during its fiscal third quarter.</p>
<p>"Despite declines in pricing during the later part of the third quarter, we are very encouraged by the dramatic improvements in operating results achieved during the quarter," Theobald said.</p>
<p>Stokely reported a profit of $0.06 a share for the third quarter versus a loss of $0.32 last year. Net sales were $55.34 million compared with $65.46 million.  </p>
<p>The sales decline, the company said, was a result of a $6.28 million decline in frozen sales and a $3.84 million or 7.1 percent decrease in canned vegetable sales.</p>
<p>The decrease in canned sales volume appears to be the result of fewer promotions at the retail level because of concerns over less available inventory and higher prices due to weather, Stokely said. It said trade promotions returned to historical levels later in the third quarter.</p>
<p>The fall in frozen sales reflects the liquidation of essentially all the remaining frozen inventory as the company continued with its previously announced plan to exit the frozen vegetable business.</p>
<p>Theobald said that, despite the recent drop in prices, the company continues to focus on its restructuring plan.</p>
<p>"We will not allow ourselves to be distracted by short-term events while we implement the changes to our business that should make those very events less problematic in the future," he said.</p>
<p>"Once the implementation of our restructuring efforts are completed, we believe the company will be positioned to deliver further improvements from our historical operating results," Theobald said.</p>
