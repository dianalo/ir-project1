<p>A Vienna-Warsaw express train careered off a bridge and some of its cars plunged into floodwaters in the northeastern Czech Republic on Monday, injuring at least 64 passengers, police said.</p>
<p>"As far as we know there was no loss of life," a police officer in the city of Ostrava told Reuters, adding that several carriages were submerged in water. The bridge had apparently been weakened by floods.</p>
<p>The incident occurred on the Odra river south of Ostrava, the third biggest Czech city, just before 1 p.m. (1100 GMT).</p>
<p>Initial Czech television footage from the accident site showed several carriages overturned next to a rushing river but they were generally intact and out of the water. A small bridge over the water was all but destroyed.</p>
<p>The Czech news agency CTK quoted a Czech Railways official from the accident site at Suchdol nad Odrou as saying that 10 of the 64 casualties were seriously injured.</p>
<p>CTK said torrential rain since the weekend was believed  to have caused six deaths -- two women and four men -- but it stressed no casualty report had been independently confirmed.</p>
<p>About one-third of Ostrava was inundated, Czech radio said.</p>
<p>A state of emergency was declared as road, railway, electricity, and telephone services were disrupted in many parts of the northeast and sources of drinking water tainted.</p>
<p>Officials issued appeals for potable water and emergency supplies as rivers kept rising.</p>
<p>Serious flooding afflicted parts of neighbouring Poland too and the Polish cabinet held a crisis session on Monday to come to grips with the situation. Army cadets, soldiers and police reinforced fire brigades dealing with emergencies.</p>
<p>Hundreds of homes were flooded in the Polish provinces of Katowice, Walbrzych and Opole. Children had to be evacuated from holiday camps while underground gas, electricity and telecommunications facilities were swamped in the Upper Silesia industrial belt not far from the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>Across the border, Czechs marooned by flood waters had to scramble onto their rooftops in numerous towns and villages lining tributaries to the Opava and Morava rivers.</p>
<p>Reuters photographer Sean Gallup said by telephone from the village of Rapotin that families were rushing to get their children out of danger. He said firemen had to form a human chain to help pull a man, his wife, and three young daughters make their way through surging waist-high water.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people, including children attending summer camps near the rising waters, were evacuated.</p>
<p>Rescue helicopters, soldiers, police and fire units were dispatched to flood zones from around the country.</p>
<p>Forecasts throughout much of the region were for heavy rain through at least Tuesday, threatening low-lying regions including Ostrava and the city of Zlin further downstream.</p>
<p>Early damage estimates have topped the two billion crowns ($62 million) caused by flooding in the same region last year.</p>
