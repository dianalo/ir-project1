<p>Perceptions that the Bank of England and the Treasury are at odds over monetary policy after the Bank's unusually critical Inflation Report could continue to unsettle gilts and sterling, economists said.</p>
<p>The Bank caused surprise and some consternation on Wednesday when its Inflation Report not only said further interest rate rises would be necessary, but added that the recent rally in sterling would probably prove temporary.</p>
<p>Some market participants saw this as an ungracious response to Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke's surprise decision to raise interest rates by a quarter of a point to 6.0 percent a week earlier.</p>
<p>"The Bank of England certainly aren't pulling their punches now," said Tom Rayner, UK economist at Societe Generale.</p>
<p>"The Inflation Report has definitely been unsettling for the markets. Talk of the need for higher rates and that the rise in sterling could be temporary is a pretty potent combination to upset foreign investors, in the gilt market at least. We had been seeing quite a bit of foreign interest."</p>
<p>Sterling fell around two pfennigs against the deutschemark after the Inflation Report, there was a sell-off in short sterling and the gilt-Bund spread at 10 years widened today to an eight-month high of 190 basis points.</p>
<p>Rayner said the Treasury's rule of thumb about a strong currency being equivalent to a tighter monetary policy had been "rubbished quite blatantly" in the report.</p>
<p>Clarke has always insisted that there is no serious difference between him and Bank of England Governor Eddie George, a point made again in a Treasury statement on Wednesday.</p>
<p>But economists said Clarke could be forgiven for being annoyed at the tone of the Inflation Report.</p>
<p>David Coleman, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy, found the Bank's comments on sterling bizarre. Instead of praising last week's rate rise, the central bank "grabbed it with both hands and asked for more," he says.</p>
<p>"They have upped the ante basically, but there didn't seem to be any need to do it at this stage. It runs the risk of upsetting the Chancellor unnecessarily."</p>
<p>Coleman believes markets could suffer if the Bank continues to press for a tightening of monetary policy in the months ahead, and finds Clarke reluctant to comply ahead of a general election due by May.</p>
<p>"If this tension were to continue, I think you would see it manifesting itself probably first in the currency, and then possibly in the credit markets as well."</p>
<p>Coleman is not convinced the slide in sterling was simply due to the Bank's comments that its rise could be temporary. "I have a feeling that part of that sell-off was due to the perception that the Bank has really upped the ante and is being much more aggressive and that might not sit well with Mr Clarke."</p>
<p>"But it is a surprising situation to have a central bank which effectively tries to dismiss a rise in the external value of its currency as not important."</p>
<p>Andrew Milligan, economic adviser at General Accident, agreed that perceptions of a policy rift, whether justified or not, could undermine markets but said there are also worries about a giveaway budget on November 26.</p>
<p>"Gilts were unsettled by the base rate rise because it came out of the blue and they are worried that this means inflation is going to be worse or that fiscal policy is going to be relaxed too much," he said.</p>
<p>"It is customary for a Chancellor of the Exchequer to talk a currency up. It is unusual for Bank officials to comment on the subject."</p>
<p>Milligan says that possibly the most important aspect of the Inflation Report was the veiled warning that fiscal policy should not be too loose in the run-up to the election.</p>
<p>"It was very coded but the implication was that the Bank would very much prefer a tight budget. The warning was clear that if there is a lax budget and too much is given away in the form of tax cuts, this will boost an already buoyant consumer sector."</p>
<p>Clarke is likely to wait at least another few months before contemplating a further tightening.</p>
<p>"I think the chancellor has shown that if he thinks another rate rise is needed, he's prepared to do it before the election," Rayner said. "But I think he will sit back for at least a couple of months to see how the data come in."</p>
