<title>MALAYSIA: Malaysia interbank rates fall on maturity.</title>
<headline>Malaysia interbank rates fall on maturity.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-05-22</dateline>

<p>Malaysian interbank rates declined on Thursday morning after the maturity of a 500-million ringgit Bank Negara bill issue.</p>
<p>One-week and two-week interbank rates was down at 9.0/10.0 percent against 10/15 percent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>One-month money was down at 8.0/8.5 percent against 9.0/9.5 percent on Tuesday, three-month declined to 7.5/8.0 percent against 8.0/8.5 percent and six-month was at 7.5/8.0 percent against 8.5/9.0.</p>
<p>The market was closed on Wednesday for a Buddhist festival.  </p>
<p>The dealers said another maturity of 500 million ringgit in Bank Negara bills was expected to pull down rates further on Friday.</p>
<p>Thursday's maturity of Bank Negara bills has already been rolled over through an issue on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Many people think that the rates are not sustainable at the high levels they have reached in the last few days," said a dealer with a large Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>"That is why there are a lot of lenders in the market, which has pulled down the rates," he said.</p>
<p>But many dealers were uncertain about the near-term trend.</p>
<p>"I am not sure if rates will fall because the market is facing too big a shortage to be covered by the maturities," said a dealer with another Malaysian bank.</p>
<p>The overnight rate, which rose to 15/20 percent on Tuesday after payment for the Bank Negara bill issue, was expected to ease on Thursday.</p>
<p>One dealer said it was possible that the rates were kept high by the central bank partly as a move to fend off a fresh attack on the ringgit by speculators on Wednesday, a holiday in Malaysia.</p>
<p>At prevailing rates, it would be too expensive for players to maintain short ringgit positions, he said.</p>
<p>The rise in interbank rates started last Thursday after Bank Negara intervened aggressively in the foreign exchange market to stem the slide of the ringgit. The central bank was said to have sold around $1 billion worth of the dollar.</p>
<p>The intervention drained liquidity from the system, causing the market to be short and interbank rates to rise to unusually high levels.</p>
