<headline>PdVSA says IMF wants less Venezuela oil investment.</headline>

<p>The International Monetary Fund has asked state-owned Venezuelan oil company PdVSA to scale back its $6.5 billion investment program for 1997 by some $1 billion, PdVSA officials said.</p>
<p>"All of Friday morning PdVSA president Luis Giusti has been discussing the theme with the Finance Ministry and the visiting IMF team," the PdVSA source, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"Giusti's defending the company's position: no cuts," he added.</p>
<p>The IMF request comes as part of a wider recommendation that Venezuela deepen fiscal reforms and lower spending to reduce inflation.</p>
<p>But the source said any cuts would jeopardize the credibility of Venezuela's oil opening which has seen PdVSA sign a series of multi-billion dollar joint ventures with oil majors this year.</p>
