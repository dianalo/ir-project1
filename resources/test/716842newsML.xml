<p>French stocks rose on Wednesday, bolstered by record gains on Wall Street, but shares closed off their highs as late weakness in the bond market and a huge sale of Alcatel Alsthom shares weighed on the bourse, brokers said.</p>
<p>One trader said 14 million shares in Alcatel, or 10 billion francs, traded off-market at 752 francs each. The stock closed down 1.68 percent, weighing on the CAC-40 index.</p>
<p>It finished up 20.75 points, or 0.71 percent, at 2,950.56 after easing back from a high of 2,978.64.</p>
<p>The CAC-40 July futures contract rose 14 points to 2,951.</p>
<p>Volume was 8.57 billion francs.  </p>
<p>Brokers said bond market rumours about France's ability to meet the Maastricht criteria for European monetary union weighed on the bourse in late trading, as did a reversal on Wall Street, which opened higher but then turned down.</p>
<p>* Remy-Cointreau slumped 12.36 percent to 130.50 francs after reporting a sharp drop in 1996/97 profit due to a 158 million franc loss on currency options. The group said its currency positions would limit the benefit to results of the dollar's increase. "The options strategy was catastrophic ... it's clear Remy-Cointreau won't benefit from the dollar's rise," brokerage Ferri said in its daily stock comment.  </p>
<p>French car stocks rose, helped by a 50.7 percent surge in June car sales in Italy, a major market for the French industry.</p>
<p>"Everybody looks at the French car sales but the French carmakers export a lot -- three-quarters of Peugeot's five-month sales were exports ... Further, the foreign exchange trends are very favourable," said Philippe Barrier at SGE Delahaye.</p>
<p>Valeo, which reported a 14.6 percent rise in first-half sales and reports first-half results next week, closed 4.49 percent higher at 414.50 francs.</p>
<p>PSA Peugeot Citroen, which introduced the Citroen ZX replacement, the new Xsara, rose 2.94 percent to 596 francs.  </p>
<p>* Renault gained 1.67 percent to 146.10 francs after Vilvoorde unions approved the plan for the Belgian plant closure, adding another ray of good news in a sector wrapped in gloom. Michelin rose 2.18 percent to 385 francs.</p>
