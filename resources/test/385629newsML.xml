<p>Oil-rich but landlocked, Central Asian republics desperate to get their crude to market see an export route through Iran blocked by Tehran's ice-cold ties with the West, diplomats said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tehran-based diplomats agree that Iran is well-placed to form a bridge for Central Asian energy exports, but say its politics scare off the billions of dollars in investment needed to back its dreams of being a player on a new Silk Road.</p>
<p>"Iran is strategically well-placed to transport oil and function as a regional hub," said one Western diplomat. "But its political situation makes it a bit of a regional black hole."</p>
<p>U.S. sanctions against Iran, imposed for Iran's alleged backing of terrorism -- a charge Iran denies -- have precluded any American companies from developing an export route.</p>
<p>U.S. sanctions and cool political ties with Europe had limited many European oil companies' room for manoeuvre, another diplomat said.</p>
<p>"Sanctions have kept the multinationals guessing," he said. Swaps offer some flexibility but not for the large volumes of oil people are talking about from Central Asia and Azerbaijan."</p>
<p>The diplomats and Iranian officials said there was little chance of an early thaw in Washington-Tehran ties, as implied in some recent media reports.</p>
<p>"We do not need the United States and are not prepared to have any dialogue unless the behaviour of the United States changes," Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Mahmoud Vaezi told Reuters late on Monday.</p>
<p>Iran, which lies between the remote deserts and steppes of Central Asia and the Gulf, is pushing its geographical position hard to strengthen its ties with its former Soviet neighbours.</p>
<p>In their turn, countries like Kazakhstan -- with oil reserves officially estimated at 24 billion tonnes -- look to Iran to break their dependency on Russian pipelines which they had to rely on in the days of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>That Russia has maintained its monopoly over export routes is proving the main obstacle to real independence for the Central Asian republics.</p>
<p>"They can go through Russia, or Iran...They can use both, but there is no other choice," Vaezi said of Central Asian republics' choices of export routes.</p>
<p>Kazakhstan has agreed an oil swap deal with Iran whereby Iran provides Kazakhstan with two million tonnes of Iranian oil in the Gulf for supplies of Kazakh crude to the Tehran and Tabriz refineries in northern Iran.</p>
<p>There are other potential, if remote and more expensive, options, analysts said.</p>
<p>But plans to build a gas pipeline through war-wracked Afghanistan and an oil pipeline through Georgia to the Black Sea are mired in complex political and security concerns.</p>
<p>Turkey's state oil company Botas estimates oil production around the Caspian basin -- from Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan and Russia -- could reach 120 million tonnes by the year 2010.</p>
<p>One Western diplomat warned that European oil companies could be further constrained if their governments decide to end their "critical dialogue" with Iran.</p>
<p>Bijan Sepasy, head of an American business lobby -- the U.S.-Kazakhstan council -- said: "The U.S. is imperilling the economic security of the region by its refusal to change its stance on Iran."</p>
