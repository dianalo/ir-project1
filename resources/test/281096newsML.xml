<p>UK finance trade union BIFU on Monday urged British politicians to stop compulsory redundancies at Lloyds-TSB and force the merged bank to consult customers before it closes high street branches.</p>
<p>The union said it was writing to members of parliament (MPs) and peers, asking them to make amendments to a bill relating to the 1995 merger between Lloyds Bank and TSB Group.</p>
<p>"We believe 10,000 jobs and at least 650 branches are at risk," the union said.</p>
<p>It added that about 1,000 jobs had already been cut or were about to be cut in Lloyds-TSB through the merger of some head office functions.</p>
<p>Although the merger took effect late in 1995, Lloyds needed an act of parliament to enable it to merge the accounts of customers at the two banks.</p>
<p>The bill was due to be debated early in 1997, BIFU said in a statement.</p>
