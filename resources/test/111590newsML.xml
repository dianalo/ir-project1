<p>U.S. Senate agriculture committee chairman Richard Lugar Thursday urged diplomacy to avoid a new grain subsidy war with the European Union.</p>
<p>"If we're diplomatically successful we'll stop (the EU) from doing that," Lugar said, referring to the possibility of EU wheat dumping.</p>
<p>"If we don't spend that much time on trade...we'll have some problems again," Lugar, R-Ind., added.</p>
<p>Speaking at the annual conference of the U.S. National Broiler Council, the senator repeated his opposition to the resumption of U.S. Export Enhancement Program subsidies.</p>
<p>USDA trade adviser Paul Drazek is currently in Europe for talks on grain trade and other issues.</p>
