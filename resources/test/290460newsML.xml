<p>A former Barings executive is to appeal against a reprimand from British financial markets regulator, the Securities and Futures Authority (SFA), a spokesman for the watchdog said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I can confirm that in connection with Mr Ron Baker, we have received an appeal against the tribunal's decision," SFA official David Jones told Reuters.</p>
<p>In November, Baker said an SFA tribunal had cleared him of most misconduct charges. He had been charged with failing to show "due skill, care and diligence" in the run up to the collapse of Barings in February 1995 but fought the case.</p>
<p>Baker's lawyer said then that the tribunal had not found in his favour over his monitoring of one part of Barings' proprietory trading activities. His punishment, a reprimand, was the lowest form of sanction open to the tribunal.</p>
<p>Baker was head of financial products at Barings and said he was not involved in the investment bank's agency business through which Singapore-based trader Nick Leeson racked up losses of around $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>The SFA said it had not lodged an appeal of its own against the first tribunal's decision to clear Baker of most charges. A separate appeals tribunal would be set up to hear Baker's case.</p>
<p>The DFA was criticised for not disciplining Barings' chairman, Peter Baring, and his deputy, Andrew Tuckey.</p>
<p>It did however ban chief executive Peter Norris in the wake of the bank's collapse.</p>
<p>Barings was rescued by Dutch financial giant Internationale Nederlanden Groep after it crashed. Leeson is currently serving a six-and-a-half year prison sentence in Singapore.</p>
