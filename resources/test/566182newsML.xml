<p>More than half of the Taiwanese investing in rival China have suffered losses on their investments, a government-sponsored survey said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The survey, financed by Taiwan's top economic planning agency, said 51.4 percent of Taiwan firms said their China investments lost money in 1995, while 43.5 percent of foreign companies reported losses there.</p>
<p>The survey did not offer any explanation for the losses and officials declined to comment.</p>
<p>The cabinet's Council for Economic Planning and Development made the survey public at the time when the government has urged its investors to remain cautious on investment policy toward its giant neighbour.</p>
<p>Fourteen percent of Taiwan-funded businesses said their profitability in the mainland was below three percent in 1995, while 13 percent said their profitability was between three and 15 percent.</p>
<p>Only a scant nine percent enjoyed a profitability exceeding 15 percent.</p>
<p>Taiwan, separated from China at the end of a civil war in 1949, bans direct contact and investment on the mainland. All investment must be government approved and routed through Hong Kong or other third places.</p>
<p>Some 30,000 companies from Taiwan, which China regards as a renegade province, have poured more than US$30 billion into the mainland.</p>
<p>Due to strained ties, Taiwan has expressed concern that its economy may become too dependent on China, thus becoming politically vulnerable.</p>
<p>Economics Minister Wang Chih-kang last week told parliament the government had drafted a set of criteria to govern local investment in China.</p>
