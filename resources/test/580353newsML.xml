<p>U.S. Plains feedlot cattle bids early Tuesday at $68.00 per cwt were passed by owners pricing cattle at $70.00, feedlot sources said.</p>
<p>Fed cattle prices this week were seen underpinned by smaller numbers of market-ready cattle and outlooks for continued firm beef demand, they said.</p>
<p>Many cattle were lighter following three weeks of active packer buying, which allowed owners to sell cattle ahead of schedule as much as three weeks and keep current in their marketings, sources said.</p>
