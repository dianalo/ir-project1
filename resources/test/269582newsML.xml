<p>Up to half of all prisoners in the Australian state of Queensland use illicit drugs smuggled in by prison visitors and staff, according to an official study.</p>
<p>A six-month inquiry commissioned by the state government found visitors were the main suppliers of drugs, but some prison staff were also involved.</p>
<p>"A small number of custodial officers carry on quite improper relationships with both male and female inmates, steal from the centres, use illicit drugs themselves and carry them into the custodial centres," it said.</p>
<p>"This trafficking is done both for cash profit and for other improper advantage such as sexual favours."</p>
<p>The report highlighted the pressure on families of prisoners with drug problems to smuggle drugs into jails and to settle debts incurred by inmates.</p>
<p>One couple mentioned in the study had turned in their own son for drug offences only to find themselves forced to spend a large part of their wages keeping him supplied with drugs in jail.</p>
<p>"Fear of retribution is very real," the report said. "Violence is an everyday occurrence in our prisons and murders do occur."</p>
<p>The inquiry found that nearly all forms of illicit drugs were readily available in prison, and prices could be three or four times higher than outside jail.</p>
<p>The high rate of drug abuse was directly related to the increase in the number of convictions associated with financing a drug habit.</p>
<p>Up to 70 percent of all prisoners in Queensland correctional centres had been convicted of a drug or drug-associated offence.</p>
