<p>Airports operator BAA Plc said traffic at its seven British airports in January rose 5.2 percent to 6.7 million passengers compared with a year ago.  </p>
<p>The company said the increase would have been six percent but foggy weather in mid-January disrupted traffic at its three London airports and cut traffic by 30,000 passengers. The number of flights using BAA airports increased, with total air movements up 4.2 percent at 77,395 landings and takeoffs.</p>
<p>Cargo tonnage was up 7.6 percent at 112,018 tonnes.</p>
<p>Passenger traffic at London Gatwick jumped by nine percent to 1.51 million passengers and was up three percent at London Heathrow at 4.04 million passengers. Traffic at Stansted, its third London airport, was up 11.4 percent at 286,700 passengers.</p>
