<p>Meetings between European and Asian nations that ended this weekend exposed deep rifts over political and human rights issues, partly a reflection of fundamental cultural differences, delegates said.</p>
<p>The 25 foreign ministers at the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) spent much of their time deciding what they would not talk about -- almost anything contentious.</p>
<p>They would avoid bilateral issues, ones already discussed in other forums and those that play to a domestic audience or the international media, the conference chairman, Singapore Foreign Minister Shanmugam Jayakumar told a news conference on Saturday.</p>
<p>Suggested topics could include international crime and environmental issues.</p>
<p>The muted ASEM talks followed robust exchanges over Burma and human rights among many of the same participants in last week's meeting between the European Union (EU) and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).</p>
<p>The ministers even had a frank discussion over whether to continue the 20-year ASEAN-EU dialogue or have it subsumed under the ASEM process. They decided to continue, but senior ASEAN officials said that debate was far from finished.</p>
<p>The Asian lineup in ASEM groups ASEAN -- Brunei, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- with Japan, China and South Korea. The 15 members of the European Union constitute the European side in ASEM.</p>
<p>Differences arise because Europe, with its Judaeo-Christian heritage and tradition of parliamentary democracy, is far more culturally homogeneous than Asia, a senior ASEAN official said.</p>
<p>ASEAN governments range from an absolute monarchy in Brunei, to parliamentary democracies in Singapore and Malaysia and a government dominated by former generals in Indonesia. Thailand has a long history of military coups.</p>
<p>It has Moslem majorities in Malaysia and Indonesia, Catholics in the Philippines, Buddhists in Indochina and strong minorities of Hindus, Taoists and other sects.</p>
<p>The opposition has been outlawed in Brunei and doesn't exist in communist Vietnam.</p>
<p>Political dissent is circumscribed across much of the region. Opposition figures like Megawati Sukarnoputri in Indonesia have been prevented from standing for office. Malaysia and Singapore have tough internal security laws that have been criticised by human rights groups.</p>
<p>Asia has not expressed much sympathy for Burma's pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.</p>
<p>"When the Europeans start pounding on about Burma, it makes some of us uncomfortable," said one Asian diplomat.</p>
<p>Indonesia's President Suharto, a former general himself, will meet Burma's ruling junta next weekend in Rangoon, where he will witness a joint venture agreement between a Burmese state firm and a company controlled by his oldest daughter.</p>
<p>Burma is due to join ASEAN possibly as early as this year. The prospect alarms Europe, which is trying to ostracise Burma's military rulers and will not give visas to its leaders. Europe is demanding ASEAN put pressure on Burma's generals to reform.</p>
<p>But Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn told reporters on Saturday that Europe should in turn pressure pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to talk with Burma's generals.</p>
<p>Asian leaders are not always comfortable with charismatic opposition leaders in their midst. It was only 11 years ago that Benigno Aquino was assassinated by soldiers loyal to Philippine strongman Ferdinand Marcos.</p>
<p>While Burma was the hot issue this time, previous meetings have seen Indonesia fend off criticism over its human rights record in East Timor by EU member Portugal. China does not want Taiwan and South China Sea territorial disputes to come up.</p>
<p>It was not surprising that the one concrete achievement of the ASEM meeting in Singapore was the opening on Saturday of an Asian-Europe Foundation to foster cultural ties.</p>
<p>The mission of this first institution created under ASEM, said Singapore's Jayakumar, was to provide cultural exchanges "to ensure that our growing political dialogue and burgeoning economic ties rest on the secure foundation of mutual understanding and enjoys public support".</p>
