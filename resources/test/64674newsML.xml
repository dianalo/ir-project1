<p>President Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire is convalescing after surgery for prostate cancer and is receiving outpatient chemotherapy treatment at a Lausanne hospital, sources close to his delegation said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The Swiss Foreign Ministry this week for the second time extended Mobutu's visa, granted on medical grounds, but a spokesman declined to say for how long.</p>
<p>Mobutu, who was operated on in late August for prostate cancer at the University and Hospital Centre of Switzerland's Vaud canton, is staying in a suite at a luxury hotel in Lausanne along Lake Geneva.</p>
<p>"He is doing fine," said a source close to his delegation.</p>
<p>Another source told Reuters: "He is being treated as an outpatient and getting some sort of therapy."</p>
<p>A hotel source told Reuters: "I heard he is pretty seriously ill and staying for some time. Apparently he is having chemotheraphy here."</p>
<p>In Kinshasa on Wednesday, Zaire's government banned a leading opposition newspaper after it published a report saying that Mobutu would have an operation for throat cancer.</p>
<p>Mobutu's spokesman in the central African country said that the President was recovering well.</p>
<p>"We expect him to return home in three weeks. He needs rests but to this day there is no cause for concern about him," the spokesman added.</p>
