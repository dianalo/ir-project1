<p>Illinois Development Finance Authority delayed until spring a legislative push to increase its bonding authorization, the agency's director said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Bobby Wilkerson said the agency was advised by officials in Gov. Jim Edgar's office that the fall veto session of the General Assembly, which began Tuesday, was too hectic to take up the agency's proposal.</p>
<p>In August, agency officials said that with existing authorization rapidly running out, a push was needed this fall to get lawmakers to approve $2.9 billion in new bond authorization.</p>
<p>Wilkerson said that he did not know exactly what the delay will mean for the agency. He added that a hiring and salary freeze were possible given the agency's dependency on fees from bond deals for its funding.</p>
<p>"We'll make do as best we can," Wilkerson said.</p>
<p>The legislative proposal outlined by the agency in August called for $900 million more in bonding authorization for environmental projects, $1.5 billion for general project, including industrial revenue bonds and debt sold for 501(c)3 organizations, and $500 million for government borrowing.</p>
<p>The authority's bonding power was last increased by the legislature in 1993.</p>
