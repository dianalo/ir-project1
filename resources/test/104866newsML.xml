<p>The Czech parliament may vote on the first reading of the state budget late Wednesday afternoon at the earliest, a senior parliamentarian told Reuters.</p>
<p>"There are 12 people scheduled to speak, but more can be added at any time during the debate so I don't expect a vote until late afternoon or maybe early in the evening," said Karel Ledvinka, of the banking and parliamentary office commission.</p>
<p>Ledvinka is also a member of the junior government coalition party, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA).</p>
<p>The lower chamber of parliament was originally expected to hold the first reading of the draft budget on Tuesday, but the opposition Social Democrats have said they would seek changes to two paragraphs in the draft.</p>
<p>The far-right Republican Party (SPR-RSC) and the little-reformed Communists (KSCM) are also expected to give lengthy speeches that could delay the vote.</p>
<p>Klaus's three-party coalition holds only 99 seats in the 200-seat chamber. The Social Democrats can therefore block the budget if they win full support from the Communists and Republicans.</p>
