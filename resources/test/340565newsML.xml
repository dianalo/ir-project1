<p>Brazilian shares closed sharply lower in moderate trade as investors reaped profits from several weeks of rises ahead of Tuesday's expected passage of a re-election bill by Congress' lower house, brokers said.</p>
<p>"It closed ugly," one broker told Reuters. "The only explanation is that the market has entered a profit-taking phase on the re-election vote, which was anticipated."</p>
<p>The Sao Paulo bourse's Bovespa index of 49 most-traded shares dropped 1.44 percent to close at 77,369 points in trade of 449.1 million reais ($429.8 million).  </p>
<p>Brokers said broad profit-taking after the Chamber of Deputies granted prelimiary approval to a re-election amendment offset the generally upbeat prospects for local stocks and rises on Wall Street to drive prices down.</p>
<p>"There was no news and no surprise in Brasilia today and the Dow was rising, so investors apparently had very much anticipated re-election would pass," one dealer said.  "It was really a wave of profit-taking."  Blue chips across the board were hit.  Benchmark Telebras preferred tumbled 1.66 percent to end at 88.60 reais while its voting common closed 1.65 percent lower at 82.70 reais.  </p>
<p>Telebras shares and options accounted for a majority of the day's turnover.</p>
<p>Among top-losing leaders, state power holding Eletrobras</p>
<p>Eletrobras's decline led the drop in the bolsa's Electrical Energy Index of nine most-liquid shares, which ended off 1.6 percent at 2,251 points.</p>
<p>Leading power share Cemig also fell, ending off 2.07 percent at 42.99 reais.  </p>
<p>State mining firm Cia Vale do Rio Doce closed 1.88 percent lower at 23.00 reais while Brazilian state oil monopoly Petrobras slipped 0.53 percent to end at 189.00 reais.</p>
<p>Bucking the tumbling trend, preferred shares of troubled meatpacker Chapeco skyrocketed 35.71 percent to 0.19 reais. "The company has had troubles for a while and the market speculated that the company has reached a deal with a large new partner," a broker sasid.</p>
<p>Brokers said profit-taking may continue Thursday at the open because the market closed in a selling mood.</p>
