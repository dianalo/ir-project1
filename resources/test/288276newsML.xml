<p>Zimbabwean stocks marched ahead in active Monday trade with brokers saying they expected them to continue firmer for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>The 57-counter industrial index rose 28.48 points to close at a new all time high of 8,951, boosted largely by publishing group Zimpapers' 450-cent leap to 2,900, merchant bankers FMB's 100-cent surge to 4,500 and clothing and furniture retailer Tedco's 60-cent jump to 1,050.</p>
<p>"The market opened on a very firm note again and I expect this firm trend to continue for the rest of the week before we see some profit-taking next week," one broker said.</p>
<p>Among Monday's winners, sugar producer Hippo and bankers Barclays each rose 50 cents to 1,100 and 2,600 respectively, while clothing retailer Truworths at 1,100, finance group Finhold at 725 and cable manufacturer BICAF at 325 all gained 25 cents.</p>
<p>Farming implement-maker Zimplow at 470 and tea producer Tanganda at 310 both added 20 cents while tea and coffee grower EHPL, textiler Spinweave and sugar refinery ZSR each put on 15 cents to 160, 140 and 1,475 respectively.</p>
<p>Against the trend, clothing retailer Edgars fell 200 cents to 4,000, hotel and supermarket group Meikles dropped 100 cents to 2,200, Alloys shed 30 cents to 770 and horticulture company Acacia lost 15 cents to 330.</p>
<p>On the mining board, gold producer Ashanti was unchanged at 10,000 while Rio Tinto -- another gold counter -- dropped 100 cents to 2,800.</p>
<p>Wankie Colliery added 10 cents to 630 in reasonable turnover and nickel miner Bindura gained 20 cents to 820, leaving the seven-share mining index 4.75 points up at 1,122.54.</p>
