<p>The European Commission will clear the merger between British Telecommunications Plc and MCI Communications Corp of the United States if the companies confirm proposed "remedies to competition problems", European Competition Commissioner Karel Van Miert said on Monday.</p>
<p>"If they confirm suggestions they have already made, I will be in a position to approve the merger," Van Miert told a conference organised by Belgian University of Leuven.  </p>
<p>Van Miert was quoted by Belgian news agency Belga. His spokesman could not immediately confirm the report.</p>
<p>The Commission started a full probe into the merger at the end of January saying it was concerned that it might harm competition on the UK-U.S. route. It has until June 11 to take a final decision.</p>
<p>Van Miert was quoted as telling the conference on telecommunications law that the two partners had committed themselves to "remedy" to a few competition problems. He singled out transatlantic cable capacity, according to Belga.</p>
<p>The deal, which involves BT taking over MCI, was never expected to pose major competition problems in Europe because the British telecoms sector is more liberalised than any other markets in continental Europe.</p>
<p>It faces its most important test in the United States where legislation forbids a foreign company from taking more than 20 percent in a U.S. firm unless its home market is effectively open to competition. -- Brussels newsroom 322 2876841</p>
