<headline>Australian regional banks announce merger.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-10-14</dateline>

<p>Two of Australia's largest regional banks, St George Bank and Advance Bank, announced on Monday that they had agreed to merge in a deal valued at valued at A$2.65 billion (US$2.09 billion).</p>
<p>St George said it would offer effective A$7.30 for each Advance Bank share, equivalent to a 20-percent premium to its recent trading price. Trading in both banks' shares were halted before the announcement but Advance closed on Friday at A$6.28.</p>
<p>The merger appeared to be an attempt by the banks to stave off a takeover by one of the big four Australian banks which are currently prevented by monopoly laws from merging with each other and have been eyeing the smaller regional banks.</p>
<p>St George said Advance shareholders would be offered a combination of A$2.10 in cash, a 20-cent special cash dividend and new St George shares up to a value of A$5.00 per Advance Bank, totalling A$7.30 per share.</p>
<p>They would also receive an Advance Bank interim dividend, expected to be 20 cents, payable in February 1997.</p>
<p>"As part of the merger implementation agreement, Advance Bank has agreed to reimburse St George Bank in certain ciricumstances for costs and losses, up to A$100 million, if Advance Bank is acquired by a third party," St George added.</p>
<p>News that the two banks, both Sydney-based, had agreed to merge pushed up the shares of other regional banks.</p>
<p>Bank of Melbourne shares rose more than four percent in early trading on speculation it could be the next bid target.</p>
