<p>If British Aerospace Plc and General Electric Co agree to merge after 12 years of flirting with the idea, as a newspaper report suggested this week, it would create a British industrial monolith with a combined market value of 15.6 billion sterling ($25.5 billion).</p>
<p>But it would also be a monument to the failure of the European defence industry's efforts to break out of their national identities and consolidate across the continent.</p>
<p>At the moment BAe is keeping its options open. "We are talking with everybody and everybody is talking with everybody else," said a company spokesman. "We are not ruling anything in or anything out."</p>
<p>Europe's defence firms are feeling lonely, concerned that if they don't get together they will lack the technological and financial mass to stop U.S. combines such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing with McDonnell Douglas and Raytheon from dominating world markets.</p>
<p>But weapon-making is a highly political business and so far the European industry has found it almost impossible to overcome nationalist obstacles to cross-border deals.</p>
<p>Last year BAe and Lagardre Groupe finally got the go-ahead to merge their missile businesses to create the Anglo-French joint venture Matra BAe Dynamics.</p>
<p>But it took three years of negotiating, a painfully slow process compared to the quickfire succession of mergers that have taken place in the United States.</p>
<p>Nevertheless BAe has remained a strong advocate of trans-European consolidation, saying that the priority must be to seek cross-border "horizontal" mergers of businesses making the same products like missiles and aircraft and not the "vertical" integration of national industries.</p>
<p>According to company officials, any tie-ups with GEC, which counts BAe as the biggest single customer for its defence electronics business, are seen as coming from within that effort, not from nuclear fusion of the two groups.</p>
<p>Analysts say vertical integration would not offer the same opportunities for pooling resources or for rationalisation as horizontal mergers.</p>
<p>"If you ask me what the benefits would be of vertical integration I could not tell you," said Zafar Khan of SocGen.</p>
<p>"It would be very difficult to put BAe and GEC together and have one and one equalling anything more than two," said Sash Tusa of UBS.</p>
<p>But newspapers speculated this week that the two British firms might go for the big merger if they felt they are not getting anywhere in mainland Europe.</p>
<p>The frustrations were underlined last week when France said it would not entertain foreign bids for defence electronics group Thomson-CSF.</p>
<p>Paris has raised the prospect of its defence firms going into a national melting pot of privatisation, to blend Thomson with St Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale, Dassault Aviation, Alcatel-Alsthom and Lagardere to create the sort of leviathan that GEC and BAe have so far avoided in Britain.</p>
<p>If this happened BAe and GEC might defy industrial logic and also combine to create a counterweight .</p>
<p>"The logic dictates that there should not necessarily be a BAe-GEC merger," said SocGen's Khan. "But the way the world is going it may prove inevitable," he said.</p>
<p>Conversely creation by the French industry of a single "national champion" could be the prelude to allowing BAe and GEC into cross-border tie-ups in their particular sectors.</p>
<p>"If anything BAe and GEC's current problem is that they already frighten almost every other European firm," said Sash Tusa of UBS.</p>
<p>"Individually they are far too financially strong, far too profitable and far too big for most other Europeans to do deals with from a position of equality," he said.</p>
<p>Sooner or later analysts say GEC will have to find a way of linking with Thomson-CSF as Europe's two big players in defence electronics.</p>
<p>But BAe's main challenge is completely different -- to get consolidation of Europe's civil and military aircraft industry to be able to rival Lockheed and the merger between Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. ($= 0.611 British Pounds Sterling)</p>
