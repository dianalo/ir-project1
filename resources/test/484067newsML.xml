<p>Ukraine slapped restrictions on Russian military aircraft flying in its airspace after unauthorised jets flew over the Black Sea during a recent NATO visit to Ukraine, a defene ministry official said on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Certain limits were imposed after some Russian aircraft flying over the Black Sea on March 25 and 26 violated rules governing the routes they were allowed to fly," a duty officer in the defene ministry press office told Reuters.</p>
<p>He gave no details about the restrictions or their duration, placed weeks before Russian President Boris Yeltsin is due to visit Ukraine -- a trip proposed and then called off at least six times in the past two years.</p>
<p>Ukrainian media, quoting unnamed defence officials, said the central Russia-based long-distance TU-22 military jets were flying spy missions in connection with a recent goodwill visit of NATO warships to the Ukrainian Black Sea port of Odessa.</p>
<p>"Russian planes must choose to follow international rules of aviation which require permission to fly certain air routes, in order to ensure safety in the air," the official said.</p>
<p>Ukraine, unlike Russia, is not opposed to eastward expansion of the western military alliance</p>
<p>In Moscow, officials in Russia's foreign ministry and air force confirmed that the restrictions were in place but declined to comment why they had been imposed.</p>
<p>Valery Yevnyevich, chief commander of the 6,000-strong Russian military base in the Dnestr region of Moldova bordering Ukraine, said its planes were trapped because of the new rules, Russia's Tass news agency reported.</p>
<p>Yeltsin promised last week to visit Ukraine in early June despite a long-running dispute between the two sides over division of the former Soviet Black Sea fleet.</p>
