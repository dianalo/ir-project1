<headline>Oregon executes first prisoner in 34 years.</headline>

<text>
<p>Oregon carried out its first execution in 34 years on Friday on a man convicted of killing three homeless men he lured off the streets of Portland with promises of work.</p>
<p>Douglas Wright, 56, died by lethal injection after he refused to appeal his sentence further and the Oregon Supreme Court rejected a last-minute effort by a civil rights group to save his life.  </p>
<p>Wright was pronounced dead at 12:16 a.m./3:16 a.m. EDT, said Perrin Damon, director of communications for the Oregon Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>An Iowa native, Wright was convicted of the 1991 execution-style slayings of three homeless men, whose bodies were found on the Warm Springs Indian reservation.</p>
<p>He previously had served time for a double-homicide and said he did not want to appeal his death sentence because he deserved to die.</p>
<p>He became the first person executed in Oregon since LeeRoy McGahuey died in the gas chamber in 1962.</p>
