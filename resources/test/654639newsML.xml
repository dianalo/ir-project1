<p>Finnish oil, chemicals and energy group Neste Oy said on Wednesday it expected full-year 1997 operating profit to improve on last year when it was 1.08 billion markka.</p>
<p>"Despite uncertainty in respect of the crude price and other market prices there is reason to believe that overall, Neste's operating profit for 1997 will improve on 1996," it said in a statement with its January-April results.  </p>
<p>Neste reported January-April profits before extraordinary items of 214 million markka, little changed from the 219 million markka booked in the same period last year.</p>
<p>First tertial performance was effected by a 250 million markka inventory loss at the group's oil division, due to lower crude oil prices, Neste said.</p>
<p>"Neste's basic petroleum inventories are not hedged against fluctuations in the oil price," Neste said, adding that most of the inventories were strategic petroleum inventories required by law. </p>
<p>Neste said progress had been made in negotations on the sale of its 50 percent holding in petrochemicals group Borealis, which it owns together with Statoil of Norway. It did not elaborate.</p>
