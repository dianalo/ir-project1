<p>Microsoft Corp chairman Bill Gates was quoted on Wednesday as saying India could become a global software superpower and was a more attractive investment target for his firm than China.</p>
<p>"India has the momentum to become a software superpower. It has the necessary potential. All that India needs is a few examples of successful companies," Gates said in an interview published in the Economic Times.</p>
<p>"The importance of India as a software country and a place we've decided to invest in is greater than China. I am impressed with the talent India has. The world can draw from this enormous pool of talent," he said.</p>
<p>Gates, who has won front-page headlines during his four-day visit that began on Monday, said he was impressed by India's success in halting software piracy and by government efforts to encourage the growth of information technology.</p>
<p>"My trip is a milestone in terms of my understanding of what kind of partnerships we can have (with India), where the market is, and I think we are getting quite a warm reception," Gates told the daily.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old Microsoft chief said he was optimistic that the firm would develop "talking computers" within the next five years.</p>
<p>"It's an area (in which) we have done a lot of advanced research. We have the higher speed chips that are extremely helpful. The thing that's tough is that speech is somewhat ambiguous," he said.</p>
<p>Gates, one of the richest men in the world with a 25 percent stake in Microsoft estimated at some $23 billion, said computer-induced changes had profoundly changed the way people think about education, democracy and markets.</p>
<p>"It's a sort of ultimate tool of capitalism -- to be able to reach out to see everybody who wants to sell a product or services, everybody who wants to buy that product or services, and let them collaborate," he said.</p>
<p>Gates was due to launch a new product and address a seminar in Bombay on Wednesday.</p>
