<p>Finnish national carrier Finnair Oy needs a strong European partner to secure growth in a market where air fares are falling steadily, Finnair CEO Antti Potila said in a company newsletter received on Thursday.</p>
<p>"European airlines are interested in Finnair. And Finnair absolutely needs a strong European partner to support our growth," Potila was quoted as having told an in-house marketing seminar earlier in March.</p>
<p>In Europe, outside the Nordic countries, Finnair was "looking into and investigating possible new schemes," he said but did not elaborate. @</p>
<p>"Cooperation groupings which will compete with each other are likely to be created around the big older airlines," Potila said, painting, according to the newsletter, his vision of the future trend in the European aviation industry.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Finnair, Norwegian Braathens SAFE and Swedish Transwede Airways said they planned to step up cooperation -- a move seen as closing ranks against Scandinavian airline SAS. More details are due next week.</p>
<p>In the newsletter, Potila said Finnair had adopted an offensive approach. "The old conservative national airline is being left behind." @</p>
<p>The future held more opportunities than threats, he said, adding, however that: "We are sellng a product the price of which is falling continuously."</p>
