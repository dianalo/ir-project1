<p>Esquire magazine has tapped David Granger, the No. 3 editor of rival men's magazine GQ, to become its newest editor-in-chief, it announced Thursday.</p>
<p>Granger, who has worked at GQ since 1991, becomes Esquire's editor effective immediately, the magazine said.</p>
<p>"Esquire was the first magazine I ever read," Granger said in a statement. "My ambition has always been to edit it."</p>
<p>Hearst Magazines President Cathleen Black said, "David's award-winning tenure at GQ, his ability to attract top writers, and his understanding of what men want today can make Esquire the most vibrant, intelligent men's magazine in America."</p>
<p>Hearst Magazines, which owns Esquire, is part of privately owned Hearst Corp. which also owns Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan and Harper's Bazaar.</p>
<p>In recent years, Esquire, the traditional leader in men's magazines, has seen declines in ad pages and circulation, while those of GQ have risen.</p>
<p>GQ is owned by magazine publishing rival Conde Nast Publications, which also owns Vanity Fair and Vogue, among others.</p>
<p>Granger was the No. 3 editor at GQ. Hearst said he was responsible for launching the magazine's "Personal Best" section and was credited with drawing top writers to the magazine, which earned two National Magazine Awards during his tenure there.</p>
