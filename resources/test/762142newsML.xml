<headline>NFL-CHIEFS SIGN THEIR FIRST ROUNDER.</headline>
<dateline>KANSAS CITY, Missouri 1997-07-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs on Tuesday signed their first-round pick, University of California tight end Tony Gonzalez, to a six-year contract. Financial terms were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The Chiefs traded four picks in order to move up five spots in the first round to select Gonzalez 13th overall in the April draft.</p>
<p>Gonzalez is expected to immediately become an impact player in Kansas City's revamped passing game.</p>
<p>The Chiefs signed quarterback Elvis Grbac and wide receivers Brett Perriman and Andre Rison as free agents to upgrade an offence that sagged last year with quarterback Steve Bono and a sub-par receiving corps.</p>
<p>Gonzalez, a first-team All-American in 1996, led all college tight ends with 699 receiving yards and tied Brigham Young's Itula Mili for the lead in receptions with 46.</p>
<p>In three years at Cal, Gonzalez caught 89 passes for 1,302 yards (14.6 avg) with eight touchdowns in 33 games. He had 37 catches for 541 yards and two touchdowns in 11 games as a sophomore in 1994.</p>
