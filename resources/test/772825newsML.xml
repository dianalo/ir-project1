<p>CSCE world sugar was off at midday in the  wake of technical-based fund selling, but rebounded slightly.</p>
<p>"The commission houses triggered some sell stops at 11.60-11.62 (in  the October contract)," one floor trader said. "It looked like the  funds were behind it."</p>
<p>He added that commercial traders were scale-up buyers later in the  session.</p>
<p>At 1241 EDT, October sugar was off 0.10 cent at 11.58 cents a lb,  traded 11.50 to 11.76 cents.</p>
<p>Volume on both sides of the Atlantic was quiet.</p>
