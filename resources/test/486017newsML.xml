<p>Concerns over the U.S.-Japan trade gap have been gnawing at the dollar's value against the yen, but are unlikely to take a major chunk out of the U.S. currency and usher in a sustained downtrend, analysts said on Thursday.</p>
<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin will hold high-profile talks in Tokyo on Friday, having already spooked markets with his warnings to Japan not to let its trade surplus swell again.</p>
<p>But the start of the Japanese fiscal year and the prospect of continued rock-bottom interest rates will ensure the yen reaps limited reward from the trade issue, analysts said.</p>
<p>"Our feeling is that this is probably temporary strength in the yen rather than a trend reversal at this stage," said Stephen Hannah, director of research at IBJ International here.</p>
<p>Dollar/yen pulled back to a three-week low 121.35 on Tuesday amid nerves ahead of Rubin's meeting with Japan's prime minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and finance minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka.</p>
<p>It edged back up to around 122.70 by the European midsession on Thursday, after stumbling earlier when the International Monetary Fund said some of the yen's depreciation could be reversed and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company declared it would be comfortable with levels around 110 yen.</p>
<p>But experts' forecasts suggest Matsushita is likely to be disappointed. A Reuters poll of 22 currency economists foresees dollar/yen trading around 122.57 one month from now, 122.14 in three months and 120.46 in six months' time.</p>
<p>"Whilst the yen is likely to receive some support from concerns about re-emerging trade tension between the U.S. and Japan...there's no reason why we should see any dramatic fall in the dollar against the yen," said Nick Stamenkovic, economist at DKB International in London.</p>
<p>Ongoing problems in Japan's financial sector mean the Bank of Japan will want to keep interest rates low, analysts said.</p>
<p>That, in turn, will dampen the yield attraction of Japanese assets. Japan's discount rate stands at an all-time low of 0.5 percent, while its U.S. equivalent is five percent. The U.S. Fed funds rate rose a quarter-point last week to 5.50 percent.</p>
<p>"Dollar/yen should rise on the back of the enormous yield spread in favour of the dollar as the new quarter starts," said Tony Norfield, treasury economist at ABN AMRO here.</p>
<p>Kampo, Japan's largest institutional investor, told Reuters on Thursday it was interested in buying more foreign bonds.</p>
<p>It cited wide yield differentials between Japan and countries such as the United States, plus expectations that the dollar is unlikely to fall below 120 yen in the near term.</p>
<p>General economic strife should also keep Japan's rates low, analysts said, noting that the latest quarterly "Tankan" survey of Japanese corporate activity showed small firms and non-manufacturers struggling, and not benefiting from the weak yen.</p>
<p>With the new fiscal year just begun and U.S. asset markets wobbly, Japanese capital has yet to flood out of the country. "But the market knows that U.S. Treasuries continue to top the shopping list for Japanese institutions," IBJ's Hannah said.</p>
<p>Even market fears of escalating U.S-Japan trade tensions may be exaggerated, some believed.</p>
<p>Vice Finance Minister Tadashi Ogawa has said Japan will tell Rubin it aims for growth centring on domestic demand, and that its trade surplus should not expand as rapidly as in the past.</p>
<p>And though Rubin warned overnight that a renewed Japanese surplus could cause friction, he vehemently denied that his remarks were aimed at moving any currency.</p>
<p>"Expectations of a heavy-handed approach by Rubin...are looking likely to be disappointed, particularly in reference to exchange rates," said Tim Fox, economist at Standard Chartered.</p>
