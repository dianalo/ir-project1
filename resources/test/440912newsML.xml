<p>Denmark's Icopal said on Thursday it upheld its last bid for local roadbuilder Phoenix.  </p>
<p>Last Friday, Norway's Rieber &amp; Son raised its bid for Phoenix to 875.8 million crowns, matching a rival offer by Icopal.</p>
<p>After Thursday's Icopal announcement, Phoenix board chairman Henry Petersen told Reuters that it would recommend its shareholders to take the Rieber offer.  </p>
<p>"The Phoenix board will present a recommendation within the next few days to shareholders to accept the Rieber offer. We have prepared our position, it only has to be confirmed now," Petersen said.</p>
<p>Both the Icopal and Rieber bids offer shareholders 790 crowns per share for A-shares in Phoenix Contractors and 710 crowns per share for C-shares.</p>
<p>Both bids expire on April 1 at 1500 GMT.</p>
<p>In a statement Icopal said it was upholding its original offer of March 1, which is identical to Rieber's latest bid.  </p>
<p>"Consideration for our shareholders obliges us to limit our offer despite the major strategic importance of the takeover bid," Icopal said in a statement.</p>
<p>Icopal said its aim in making the bid for Phoenix was to enable structural rationalisation to take place within Denmark's roadbuilding industry to the benefit of competitiveness and employment.</p>
<p>In a comment Reiber managing direrctor Olav Daviknes told Reuters: "I am optimistic. Only a new offer can now block Rieber's chances of taking over Phoenix."  </p>
<p>Thursday's statement from Icopal was the latest move in an increasingly bitter takeover struggle for Phoenix, launched by Rieber on January 15.</p>
<p>Heavyweight Danish construction and chemicals group Superfos, favoured by the pension funds which are Phoenix's largest shareholders, later made a higher bid but said it would not increase it again after Rieber leapfrogged ahead.</p>
<p>At one stage a fourth suitor for Phoenix, provincial Danish building contractor Marius Pedersen made an offer, but it expired two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The Phoenix board has earlier indicated its preference for Rieber on the grounds that the Norwegian firm seems more willing to respect the Jutland-based firm's autonomy and preserve jobs.</p>
<p>Rieber has a 25.7 percent equity stake in Phoenix with 23.1 percent of voting stock.</p>
