<p>It's not enough to have a pretty face.</p>
<p>Web and Internet watchers say the services most likely to succeed in 1997 will be those that help people get things done -- and they're not talking about reading the newspaper or playing a game.</p>
<p>Web-based shopping is one segment expected to generate revenue from services rendered rather than online advertising.</p>
<p>Another group comprises Web services that people use to manage the software on their computer.</p>
<p>One company offering such a product is TuneUp.com (http://www.tuneup.com/), which for minimal time and money helps owners of Windows 95 computers automatically diagnose and fix problems on their hard drive, update printer drivers and protect their personal computers from viruses.</p>
<p>Since going online Sept. 20, TuneUp.com has signed up close to 3,000 customers who pay $3.95 a month for a basic package called PC TuneUp that includes monthly virus sweeps and hard-disk optimizing and defragmenting.</p>
<p>For their money, subscribers can consult a TuneUp.com technician in a live chat room, or talk shop with other subscribers on message boards on the company's Web site. The company broadcasts daily tips on keeping a PC shipshape over BackWeb, a "push" information service similar to PointCast, and e-mails subscribers monthly reminders when it's time for a checkup.</p>
<p>For an additional $4.95 a month, subscribers can store up to 5 megabytes worth of critical files in a virtual safe deposit box, and for another $24.95 receive all the files they've stored during the year on one CD-ROM.</p>
<p>Computer-industry veterans Pat Dane and Michael Walter started TuneUp.com last May with $1.5 million in venture funding and an idea: provide an easy-to-use service for the estimated 90 percent of computer owners who don't regularly use virus scanners and other disk utility software.</p>
<p>Executives are betting most of the company's customers will come through partnerships with Internet service providers, which could offer TuneUp.com as a premium over and above a customer's regularly monthly access fee.</p>
<p>TuneUp.com announced such an agreement with GTE's Internet division in December, and TuneUp.com President Emerick Woods said the company will announce similar deals in the next 30 to 60 days. Under the agreements, TuneUp.com will share a percent of customer revenue with the service providers.</p>
<p>TuneUp.com has one competitor, CyberMedia's Oil Change (http://www.cybermedia.com/), a software programme available in retail computer stores that tracks all the software on a user's PC, then directs the person to dial into the company's remote database of available updates.</p>
<p>TuneUp.com plans to begin offering similar automatic software application upgrades in February, Woods said.</p>
<p>TuneUp.com will also soon offer subscriptions to a bundle of Internet utilities, including Net.Jet, a Web accelerator programme from Peak Technologies (http://www.peak-media.com/) that dramatically reduces the time it takes to download Web pages by making better use of existing dial-up modems and Web image-caching, among other things.</p>
<p>"We have the opportunity to go back to the subscriber again and again with additional offerings," Woods said. "It's a good business at $3.95 a month, but it's a great business" if they can persuade subscribers to sign up for more services.</p>
<p>But not all analysts are keen on the two companies' prospects.</p>
<p>TuneUp.com's business plan sounded great six months ago, but that was before Microsoft and Netscape announced competing plans to create a new type of software that marries a PC's operating system with a Web browser, software that will continually upgrade itself and deliver updates for other applications.</p>
<p>When that's available, it will make services such as TuneUp.com obsolete, said John Robb, an analyst with Forrester Research, the Cambridge, Mass., researcher.</p>
<p>"Things like virus scans will be done for you, hands off. A little service like TuneUp.com will find it difficult to find subscribers in the face of that," Robb said.</p>
<p>But commercial versions of the new Netscape and Microsoft software are unlikely to be ready until the third quarter of 1997 at the earliest. Meanwhile, Windows 95 users such as John Kennedy are happy to bide their time with TuneUp.com.</p>
<p>Kennedy, who runs a family printing business in San Francisco, tried TuneUp.com after twice being stung by computer viruses despite having installed a popular anti-virus software programme.</p>
<p>"I was taken with it right away," Kennedy said. "Every three or four weeks I get an e-mail from them saying download the latest virus protection. I do and it takes a minute or two. I hit the TuneUp.com icon and it does its thing. It's very simple. It's cheap insurance."</p>
