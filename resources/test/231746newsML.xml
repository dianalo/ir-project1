<p>The Danish KFX share index closed at a new all-time record closing high on Tuesday, buoyed by the strong dollar and unchanged or falling bond yields, with dealers seeing more gains ahead.</p>
<p>"Despite the fact that some of the key shares slipped towards the end, the market undertone remains basically positive and there should be more gains ahead if the dollar and bond situation does not change," one dealer said.</p>
<p>The top-20 KFX index gained 0.64 point to close at 131.62 - a new record closing high - while the KFX December future rose 0.75 point to 132.05 with 141 contracts each worth 100,000 crowns traded.</p>
<p>Virtually all shares advanced with the exception of FLS, which fell after fell after an initial positive market reaction to CEO Birger Riisager's prediction of an excellent 1996 result.</p>
<p>FLS slipped 10 crowns to close at 780, SAS and Copenhagen Airports dropped back, the former by one crown to 72, the latter shedding five crowns to 610.</p>
