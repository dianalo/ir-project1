<p>Israel's Tadiran Ltd announced a $3.3 million deal to supply the Turkish air force with electronic equipment used to trace pilots who abandon their planes.</p>
<p>The deal for the Asars Airborne Search and Rescue Systems is Tadiran's first with Turkey and could pave the way for other contracts, the company said.</p>
<p>The system includes a device in the pilots uniform that transmits information about his whereabouts after he has abandoned his plane.</p>
<p>Tadiran, Israel's largest electronics company, said it had already signed similar deals with Italy and France. Tadiran, also traded in New York, is a subsidiary of Koor Industries.</p>
