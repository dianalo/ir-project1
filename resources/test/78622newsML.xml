<p>By Rich Miller, Economics Correspondent</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin on Thursday urged rich creditor countries to do more to help debt-ridden poor nations get back on their feet.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters ahead of the semi-annual IMF/World Bank meeting here, Rubin said Washington backs expanding the scope of debt relief provided by the "Paris Club" of creditors to as much as 80 percent from the 67 percent ceiling now.</p>
<p>"The Paris Club reduction should be up to 80 percent," he said.</p>
<p>Representatives of the creditors' club, which includes the United States, are meeting this week in Paris to discuss how they can participate in a multi-billion dollar initiative to provide expanded debt relief to the world's poor.</p>
<p>The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have already pledged to do their part and have called on the Paris Club to expand the size of its debt relief to cover 90 percent of outstanding loans.</p>
<p>World Bank President James Wolfensohn warned last week that some debt-ridden poor nations would not be able to put their economies back on track if the Paris Club opts to provide only 80 percent debt relief.</p>
<p>Oxfam International, a private environmental and development group, singled out the Paris Club as the biggest obstacle now to the multi-billion debt relief initiative.</p>
<p>It warned on Thursday that failure to act could cost the lives of 21 million children in Africa.</p>
<p>It remains unclear though just how much the Paris Club will be willing to do. Although major creditors such as the United States seem to be lining up behind providing 80 percent debt relief, the stance of others is still uncertain.</p>
<p>In a Sept. 12 letter to the Fund, Paris Club head Christian Noyer said creditor nations would determine how much to expand their debt relief on a case-by-case basis, "taking account of the largest possible contributions of the World Bank and the IMF."</p>
<p>The IMF last week promised to find the financing necessary for it to take part in the debt relief initiative, but stopped short of spelling out where the money would come from.</p>
<p>Rubin told reporters on Thursday that the United States still believed that the Fund will have to sell off some of its nearly 104 million ounces of gold to do that.</p>
<p>But Germany and a few other industrial nations oppose gold sales and instead want the IMF to use bilateral contributions from member nations to aid the world's poor.</p>
<p>Rubin told reporters on Thursday that the United States would be willing to consult with Congress about possibly making such a contribution, but only if the IMF first agreed to sell some of its gold.</p>
<p>He suggested though that a decision on gold sales may not need to be made for some years, as the IMF currently has enough money in its kitty to last until around the year 2000.</p>
