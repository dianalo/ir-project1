<p>The total foreign currency deposits of commercial banks in the Philippines increased to $16.58 billion as of June 20 this year, the Central Bank said on Friday.</p>
<p>The level was $4.85 billion higher than a year ago.</p>
<p>"Since these deposits are considered a secondary buffer or reserve in servicing the country's foreign exchange needs, this favourable development adds more stability to the local currency," a Central Bank statement said.</p>
<p>Foreign currency deposits are mostly foreign exchange receipts of exporters and remittances of overseas Filipino workers.</p>
<p>The Central Bank sold dollars heavily earlier this week to curb the depreciation of the Philippine peso.</p>
<p>The Central Bank has not disclosed its gross international reserves level since.</p>
