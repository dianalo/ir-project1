<p>Merrill Lynch &amp; Co said on Tuesday it lowered its intermediate-term rating on Telefonica del Peru SA to accumulate from buy, but maintained its long-term buy rating on the shares.  </p>
<p>-- Merrill analyst Ray Liguori said he lowered the intermediate-term rating on the stock because it was close to his $30 per share price target.</p>
<p>-- Liguori said he lowered his 1997 earnings estimate to $1.90 per share from $2.03 per share and his 1998 estimate to $2.39 per share from $2.50 per share, because the company's accounting was becoming more conservative.</p>
<p>-- He said he raised his 1997 and 1998 revenue estimates slightly because Telefonica del Peru's cellular business was doing extremely well.</p>
