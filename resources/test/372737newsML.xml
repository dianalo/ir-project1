<title>USA: King family to reveal position on new trial for Ray.</title>
<headline>King family to reveal position on new trial for Ray.</headline>
<dateline>ATLANTA 1997-02-12</dateline>

<p>The family of Martin Luther King Jr. was expected to announce formally Thursday whether they would support James Earl Ray's request for a trial, a spokeswoman for the King family said.</p>
<p>Relatives of the civil rights leader, who was assassinated on April 4, 1968, in Memphis, Tenn., were scheduled to hold a morning news conference at King's tomb in downtown Atlanta next to the Ebenezer Baptist Church where he once preached.</p>
<p>The announcement would come a week before Ray was due to appear in a Memphis criminal court Feb. 20 to hear oral arguments on his request for a trial.</p>
<p>"The family's position on his request for a trial is what's going to be discussed. I'm sure that's what they're going to reveal at the press conference," King spokeswoman Hilda Tompkins told Reuters.</p>
<p>Ray has been serving a 99-year prison sentence since he confessed to shooting King on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis. At the time, the civil rights leader was visiting the city to support striking garbage workers.</p>
<p>Now 68 years old and suffering from cirrhosis of the liver, Ray maintains that he did not murder King but that he was the victim of a conspiracy.</p>
<p>The King Centre would not say whether the family intends to support Ray's trial request.</p>
<p>But King family members and other civil rights leaders recently have voiced qualified support for a trial that could bring them nearer to learning "the unequivocal truth" about King's murder.</p>
<p>King's son, Dexter King, who now directs the centre for nonviolent studies that bears his father's name, recently told the Atlanta Constitution that his family may now be able to cope with the pain of reopening emotional wounds that are nearly three decades old.</p>
<p>"I don't think his trial -- if he is granted a trial -- will necessarily give us the unequivocal truth," King was quoted as saying last week.</p>
<p>"But at least, in regard to new evidence, we will know more than we do now."</p>
