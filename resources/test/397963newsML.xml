<p>A 7-year-old Delaware City boy who lost part of a lung after being accidentally shot by a police officer was in a critical but stable condition on Monday, police said.</p>
<p>Brandon Sands was sleeping next to his mother on a mattress on the floor of a mobile home on Sunday when he was struck in the chest by a bullet from Newcastle County Police officer Leroy Bryant's gun, spokesman Joseph Lavelle said.</p>
<p>Bryant had entered the trailer to investigate a report of a tresspasser in the Delaware City Mobile Home Park, Lavelle said. "As he attempted to enter the darkened trailer, officer Bryant tripped over an object and lost his footing. The tripping caused his weapon to discharge a single round."</p>
<p>The boy was airlifted to Christiana Hospital in Stanton, Delaware, where doctors treated him for substantial loss of blood and partial loss of one lung, hospital spokeswoman Martha Lodge said.</p>
<p>"They're listing him as critical but stable," she said. "He had a gunshot wound to his chest and he did have surgery last night and he did lose part of his left lung."</p>
<p>She said doctors did not know when he would be discharged.</p>
<p>Bryant was at police headquarters on Monday assisting in the investigation, Lavelle said.</p>
