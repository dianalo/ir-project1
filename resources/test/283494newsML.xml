<p>Miguel Indurain, who announced his retirement on Thursday, was rated by many Spanish fans as their country's greatest-ever sportsman.</p>
<p>The burly Spaniard became the first rider ever to win the Tour de France in five consecutive years, from 1991 to 1995, and his career also included two wins in the Giro d'Italia and an Olympic gold medal.</p>
<p>Although he failed to win an unprecedented sixth Tour de France, finishing a modest 11th in the 1996 race, Indurain bounced back to take Olympic gold in the time-trial in Atlanta.</p>
<p>His failure in the Vuelta de Espana (Tour of Spain) a few weeks later was, with hindsight, predictable.</p>
<p>Indurain had not raced his home tour since 1991, fearing its tough schedule cut across other priorities.</p>
<p>But in 1996, under pressure from sponsors, Indurain relented, only to pay the cost on day 13 when he pulled out in a testing mountain stage after losing touch with his big-name contemporaries.</p>
<p>Many thought that might be the end of the line but Indurain kept cycling fans guessing until Thursday.</p>
<p>The Spaniard, whose contract with the Banesto team ran out on Tuesday, joined the team originally as a support rider for his compatriot and 1988 Tour de France winner Pedro Delgado.</p>
<p>But he emerged from Delgado's shadow to take second place in the 1991 Vuelta and shot to prominence later that season in the Tour de France.</p>
<p>An epic break-away in the important Pyrenees stage, which destroyed reigning champion Greg Lemond and the rest of the field, was the prelude to the first of his Tour de France successes.</p>
<p>Indurain produced impressive time-trial performances which became his trademark in five extraordinary years in which his command of the Tour was rarely challenged.</p>
<p>The absence of important time-trials in the Giro d'Italia one year led the Spanish press to accuse organisers of creating an 'anti-Indurain itinerary'. If that was the plan, it failed. Indurain won two Giros, showing solidity in the mountains and a growing tactical astuteness.</p>
<p>Doctors were amazed by Indurain's extraordinary lung capacity, characterised by a resting heart rate of around 30 beats per minute, a lung capacity of eight litres and a heart capable of pumping 50 litres of blood per minute for hours at a time.</p>
<p>In the mountain stages of the Tour de France, Indurain could take his pulse rate up to 150 beats per minute and drop it back to 60 on the descent within half a minute.</p>
