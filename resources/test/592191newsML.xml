<p>The Philippine interbank offered rates (PHIBOR) were higher on Friday after the Central Bank made a series of hikes in its overnight borrowing rate, traders said.</p>
<p>The sharpest increase was in the short-term rates amid the volatility caused by the problems of the Thai baht in the region's financial markets.</p>
<p>"Traders are still wary. They don't know how long the Central Bank wil keep its rate," a foreign bank dealer said.</p>
<p>Traders said the PHIBOR rates quoted still reflect the one percentage-point increase in the Central Bank's overnight rate to 13 percent. They said PHIBOR rates have now changed with the surprise announcement on Friday of the Central Bank's rate increase to 20 percent to protect the peso.</p>
