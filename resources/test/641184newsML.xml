<p>Physician Sales &amp; Service Inc said Thursday it signed a deal to buy privately owned Thompco Medical Inc.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for a stock-for-stock transaction, to be accounted for as a pooling of interest, by issuing shares of Physician Sales's common stock, valued at $2.1 million, subject to adjustment. Physician Sales stock closed at $15 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>As part of the transaction, the company will assume approximately $1.9 million of outstanding Medcor debt.  </p>
<p>Physician Sales expects the deal to be non-dilutive to fiscal 1998 earnings, before any charges related to the merger, and potentially accretive beginning in fiscal 1999.</p>
<p>Thompco, through its subsidiary Medcor, distributes radiology and imaging equipment, chemicals and supplies and provides technical service to the acute and alternate site markets through two locations and serves the Arkansas, Mississippi and Tennessee markets.</p>
<p>Medcor reported $12 million in revenues for the year ended December 31.</p>
<p>Physician Sales distributes medical supplies, equipment and pharmaceuticals to primary care and other office-based physicians in the United States and distributes in Europe through PSS-WorldMed, Inc.</p>
