<p>The sea is an inviting emerald green, the sand is golden under his shoes and the sun beats warm on his besuited back -- but nothing will persuade Shi Kaixing to linger at China's newest tourist paradise.</p>
<p>"I'll stay an hour at most... I've got work to do," said the 44-year-old private businessman as he strolled along Yalong Bay beach in the southern island province of Hainan.</p>
<p>Officials in Hainan, where holidaymakers account for a hefty 10 percent of the provincial economy, say Shi is all too typical of the Chinese visitors who are the mainstay of the local tourism industry.</p>
<p>Changing the tourist culture to persuade domestic visitors to stay longer and spend more was the key to cashing in on Hainan's tropical blessings, said Li Yingji, deputy director of the provincial tourism administration.</p>
<p>"Our purpose is to get people to spend their vacations here. Currently most visitors just come for a quick look," he said.</p>
<p>"We don't want to chase the sightseers... they are not very helpful for our economy," agreed Yu Peisheng, tourism chief in the southern Hainan city of Sanya, which channelled $200 million toward development of the Yalong Bay resort in 1995 and 1996.</p>
<p>The bay, a long arc of even sand and clear water, is the centrepiece of a tourism strategy that aims to turn virgin beaches, untapped hot springs and colourful ethnic minorities into the basis of an tourist hothouse economy.</p>
<p>Officials eager to create recreational possibilities are backing the construction of scenic spots, golf courses and resort hotels to tempt tourists to tarry longer.</p>
<p>WARM WELCOME FOR FREE-SPENDING FOREIGNERS</p>
<p>"We hope people can stop and stay for a few days," Yu said, adding that free-spending organised groups of foreign vacationers were the most welcome tourists of all.</p>
<p>While Japanese visitors spent an average 1,500 yuan ($180) for each of the average four days they stayed, Chinese visitors spent just 400 yuan and left after only 1.4 days, Yu said.</p>
<p>But despite a clutch of new luxury hotels and steadily improving links with the outside world, foreigners remain few and far between on Hainan beaches.</p>
<p>Of the 2.45 million visitors who passed through Sanya in 1996, just three percent came from abroad -- and 80 percent of those were overseas Chinese from Hong Kong, Macau or Taiwan.</p>
<p>Hainan officials plan to boost publicity in Asia and Europe to attract well-heeled tour groups, but say it can be difficult to compete with the Pacific region's more developed resorts.</p>
<p>While officials rush to build seaside hotels, they also argue that past neglect of the beaches that account for most of Hainan's 1,528 km (949 miles) of coastline can itself be a strong selling point for some visitors.</p>
<p>The determination to get more out of Hainan's tourist resources is plain on Sanya's Dadonghai Bay, which just five years ago was a placid beachfront peopled largely by backpackers and foreign students escaping northern China's bitter winter.</p>
<p>Now the bay is backed by rows of jutting hotel complexes, the dusty road to town has been widened and beach entrepeneurs offer high-priced scuba-diving lessons and sailboards for hire.</p>
<p>NO REMOTE AND MALARIAL BACKWATER</p>
<p>The high-rise hotels, along with Sanya's spanking new international airport and the three-lane highway that links the city to the provincial capital Haikou, are signs of the progress made in modernising an island known on the mainland for centuries as a remote and malarial backwater.</p>
<p>While many of the new hotels and restaurants have far to go to catch up with their rising prices and brochured promises, the tourism industry has already become a vital part of the economy of what is China's biggest special economic zone.</p>
<p>Officials say tourist takings have eased the economic slowdown that followed a speculation-fired boom in 1994, while also helping fill some of the properties left empty when the bubble burst and the bottom fell out of the real estate market.</p>
<p>Income from domestic tourists in 1996 is estimated at more than $840 million, with foreign tourists seen adding a further $85 million, said tourist administrator Li Yingji.</p>
<p>In all, 4.86 million international and domestic tourists visited the island last year, Li said.</p>
<p>"Between 1990 and 1995, the number of domestic and international tourists we received in Hainan rose by an average 36.8 percent every year," he said. "That's pretty fast growth."</p>
<p>Turning China's millions of sightseers into vacationers was the best way to retain such growth in future years, he said.</p>
<p>On Yalong Bay beach, Zhang Chunxi, a manager from the arid northwestern region of Xinjiang, seemed ready to have his holiday habits reformed.</p>
<p>"This is a fine beach," said Zhang, hauling waterproofs over his business clothes in preparation for his first jet-ski ride, a highlight of his one-day tour of Hainan.</p>
<p>"Next time, if possible, I'll bring my wife and children," he said. "I'd be very willing to stay for a vacation."</p>
