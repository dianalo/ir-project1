<p>An earthquake on Tuesday jolted an area in northwestern Iran where a quake killed nearly 1,000 people a few weeks ago, the Iranian news agency IRNA said.</p>
<p>It quoted Morteza Baqerzadeh, governor of the quake-stricken Nir area in Ardabil province, as saying the tremor damaged some houses but left no casualties.</p>
<p>The quake, measuring 4.1 on the Richter scale, hit at 10:44 a.m. (0614 GMT), the agency said.</p>
<p>In late February, an earthuake measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale killed nearly 1,000 people and injured more than 2,500 in Ardabil. It left 36,000 people homeless in the snow-swept mountainous region.</p>
<p>A force four earthquake is powerful enough to cause heavy damage in a populated area.</p>
