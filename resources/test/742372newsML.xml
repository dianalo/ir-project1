<p>The East African airline Alliance Air will add an extra direct flight between Tanzania and London to their schedule from the beginning of next month, a senior manager for the airline said on Monday.</p>
<p>Johan Bosman, Alliance's manager for Tanzania, said the airline in part was eying the increasing cargo loads of fresh produce out of the country's northern town of Arusha, close to the Kilimanjaro International Airport.</p>
<p>Alliance Air have operated two weekly flights between Dar es Salaam and London, via Entebbe in Uganda, since the start of its operation in July 1995. The new weekly flight will fly directly to London from Kilimanjaro and return to Kilimanjaro via Entebbe, Bosman said.</p>
<p>"The Kilimanjaro flight will be the first extention to our operations. Obviously we are looking at he cargo potential from the flower industry in Arusha in flying flowers to Amsterdam."</p>
<p>"The aircraft that we are using is a Boeing 747-SP which have ,a big cargo capacity of up to 23 tonnes of cargo per flight," Bosman told Reuters.</p>
<p>He said air cargo since the start of operations had been a good business for Alliance Air, which was seeing an average of some 15 tonnes of cargo per flight, mostly outbound cargo from Entebbe.</p>
<p>"We have an average of 12 to 15 tonnes a month out of Entebbe, mostly fish and vegetable. Out of Dar es Salaam we have prawns on a regular basis, about three tonnes a week on the two weekly flights to London," he said.</p>
<p>Bosman also said that SAA, on their two weekly flights to Dar es Salaam from Johannesburg, had an over-supply of cargo, but due to the small amounts of inbound cargo to the region it was not viable to start any chartered cargo flights.</p>
<p>"The cargo capacity on our flights from South Africa to here are full, it's in the region of 15 tonnes twice a week, and there is a real backlog of cargo, we just can't provide enough cargo space.</p>
<p>"But the cargo traffic is only one way and the landing and parking fees are quite high here in Dar es Salaam, compared to what you pay in Kenya for example, so it's not feasible to do cargo charters," Bosman said.</p>
<p>He said Alliance Air expected the Kilimanjaro-London flight's cargo availability of some 23 tonnes of cargo per flight, or four pallets in volume, to be running to full capacity already from October, mostly with cut flowers to the European flower markets in Holland and Germany in addition to small amounts of green beans.</p>
<p>Alliance will initially fly once a week, starting August 3 from London, but plans to increase to two weekly flights from April next year.</p>
<p>"From October we are expecting the flight to be full of flowers. The prices we have set are very competitive compared to the charter prices of flowers in Nairobi, we are charging about $1.70 per kg for the transport to London and then we truck the flowers from London to Amsterdam," said Bosman.</p>
<p>Average prices from Nairobi to Amsterdam are about $1.90 per kg.</p>
<p>"We've got very big expectations, the first flight which will get into Kilimanjaro on August four is already fully-booked," he said, adding that average occupancy rate on the two weekly Alliance flights to and from London in the last year had been at about 65 percent.</p>
<p>Alliance Air is a joint venture between South African Airlines (SAA) and the governments and national carriers of Tanzania and Uganda.</p>
<p>SAA holds 40 percent shares in the airline and the Tanzanian and the Ugandan side each holds 30 percent, devided between the government, the national carriers, Air Tanzania Corp and Uganda Airlines respectively, and private interests. - Reuters Air Cargo Service Tel+ 44 171 542 7706 Fax +5017 - www.racs.com</p>
