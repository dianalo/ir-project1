<p>Dutch pharmaceuticals wholesaler and producer OPG said on Friday it expected net profits over the current financial year ending April 30, 1997 to fall to around 60 million guilders from a year-earlier 69.2 million guilders.</p>
<p>"Barring unforeseen circumstances, the Group is forecasting a net profit of at least 60 million guilders," OPG said in a statement.</p>
<p>It said the decline in net profits reflected greatly reduced profitability in its wholesaling, distribution, pharmaceuticals manufacture and trading activities due to a new law capping Dutch drugs prices.</p>
<p>"The government's action is having a severe impact on the entire market for substitute pharmaceuticals (parallel imports and generic drugs)," it said.</p>
<p>OPG said it was taking legal action against the government.</p>
<p>"In view of the loss suffered by several group companies as a result of (the statutory reduction in pharmaceutical prices) and the unequal application of the measure, a legal action is being brought against the government and substantial damages are being claimed," OPG said.</p>
<p>It said the losses suffered through the introduction of the law at the beginning of its financial year were to some extent being made good by its subsidiaries active in other markets.</p>
<p>OPG said it was also seeking to offset lost revenues by cutting costs, adding it had cut around 100 jobs in its pharmaceuticals businesses.</p>
<p>OPG said it would publish interim results on January 16.</p>
