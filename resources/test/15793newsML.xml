<p>As one of the best mutual fund managers over the last eight years, Michael DiCarlo makes no apologies for this year's poor results at John Hancock Special Equities Fund.</p>
<p>The fund focusing on small companies has finished among the top 20 percent of all funds in its class for three of the past eight years, and two times Special Equities has been in the top 5 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services.</p>
<p>In June, Smart Money magazine named DiCarlo one of the seven best fund managers in the business.</p>
<p>But so far this year, the $1.8 billion fund has fallen about 0.3 percent, ranking it 365th out of 374 small-company funds, which have gained an average of 10.6 percent over that period, according to data from Lipper Analytical, which tracks fund performance.</p>
<p>So why has Special Equities dropped off this year?</p>
<p>DiCarlo said the fund often sputters at the beginning of the year, only to recover in the late summer and fall.</p>
<p>"It's hard to believe, actually, but it does seem to be seasonal to some extent," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>DiCarlo said the "nose-bleed" price-to-earnings ratios of many of the fast-growing companies he buys run an annual cycle of intimidating investors the first half of the year, then drawing a crowd in the second half when the companies often meet their own strong growth forecasts.</p>
<p>"Then at the beginning of the year, they go through a healthy consolidation of the gains they made in the third and the fourth quarter," he said.</p>
<p>Some others may blame the slump on DiCarlo's decision in March to leave John Hancock and start his own fund, DFS Advisors, which is expected to be up and running in October with between $100 million and $200 million in assets.</p>
<p>But DiCarlo, who has agreed to run Special Equities for another five years, said he has more time than ever to run the Special Equities fund since he left behind his executive duties at John Hancock.</p>
<p>Special Equities' high concentration in just 80 to 100 stocks can prove to be a volatile mix, said John Teall, an analyst with Lipper. About 45 percent of the fund's assets were invested in computer software and services and telecommunications companies as of July 31.</p>
<p>"He's willing to take big positions. If it works, it's great, and if it doesn't, it can be more painful," Teall said. "Certainly, he has a great long-term record."</p>
<p>Special Equities has returned 193 percent or 24.02 percent annually over the last five years, ranking it fifth out of 93 small-company funds, according to Lipper.</p>
<p>Technology shares, including one of DiCarlo's favourites, America Online Inc., took a spill in May, June and July when a long-awaited stock market correction finally arrived. America Online fell from a year high of $71 in early May to about $31 Tuesday on fears the Internet would displace online service providers.</p>
<p>"America Online is, in my opinion, a screaming buy at the price level it is at today," DiCarlo said. "You've got to realise that technology stocks are in the middle of a secular bull market that's going to last at least through the end of this decade, perhaps even longer. The '90s will be known as the decade when you had to own technology."</p>
<p>The fund held about 1.1 million shares of America Online at the end of July, the most recent date figures are available, accounting for about 2.1 percent of his portfolio.</p>
<p>Other favourites include Cascade Communications Corp., Electronics for Imaging Inc., Petsmart Inc., Elan Corp. Plc and Adaptec Inc.</p>
<p>John Hancock announced in May that Special Equities, which carries a 5 percent sales charge, or load, would be closed to new investors when it reaches $2.5 billion in net assets.</p>
