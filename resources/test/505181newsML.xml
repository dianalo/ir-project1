<p>A top executive of Mobil Corp., a key oil operator in Nigeria, said his company was uneasy about Western sanctions on Africa's largest producer of crude oil, a local newspaper reported Sunday.</p>
<p>The independent Thisday quoted Paul Hoenmans, vice president of Fairfax, Va.-based Mobil Corp., as telling a Nigerian planning group Friday that the sanctions have not provided the stable business environment the company needed.</p>
<p>The Nigerian unit of Mobil Corp. pumps around 600,000 barrels per day of Nigeria's two million daily ouput of crude oil.</p>
<p>"We are also aware of high-level policy discussions and diplomatic exchanges in the United States and elsewhere about the possibility of imposing economic sanctions against Nigeria," Hoenmans said.</p>
<p>"It is not an idle threat and Mobil is worried about the impact of sanctions on business activities in Nigeria."</p>
<p>The Vision 2010 planning group is a 197-man committee, made up of businessmen, oil executives, bankers and traditional rulers that military ruler General Sani Abacha formed in October to plan Nigeria's economic future.</p>
<p>The sanctions were imposed by Western nations because of Nigeria's lack of democracy and human rights.</p>
<p>Washington, the biggest buyer of Nigeria's main export crude oil, and the European Union banned visits to their countries by members of the military government and have also frozen arms sales and official aid following the 1993 annulment of a presidential election to restore democracy.</p>
<p>The sanctions were reinforced in 1995 when the Nigerian military defied international opinion and hanged nine minority rights activists, including writer Ken Saro-Wiwa.</p>
<p>The United States has threatened Nigeria with economic sanctions, including a possible boycott of Nigerian crude oil exports. Crude oil accounts for 90 percent of Nigeria's foreign exchange earnings.</p>
<p>The hangings earned Nigeria a suspension from the Commonwealth, a club of Britain and its former allies.</p>
<p>Ernest Shonekan, ex-Nigerian ruler and chairman of Vision 2010, said last month that the sanctions were hurting.</p>
<p>Despite criticism from the opposition, Abacha is implementing a transition plan, marked by phased elections, whereby he says he will hand power to an elected president next year.</p>
