<p>IPE gas oil futures were expected to open  around $1.50 a tonne higher on Friday with Brent crude 5-10 cents  a barrel lower, after the United Nations said overnight it expected  to give Iraq's aid distribution plan the green light early next week,  brokers said.</p>
<p>But while brokers said the U.N. news was already factored-in and was  unlikely to throw the market, the trend was downwards.</p>
<p>"The U.N. news was already doing the rounds on Thursday afternoon,"  one broker said. "But I don't see crude making fresh highs."</p>
