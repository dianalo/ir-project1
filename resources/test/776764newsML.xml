<p>Banco Bansud, one of Argentina's largest private banks, will launch a $100 million three-year bond this week, bankers said on Monday.</p>
<p>The deal is expected to be launched on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Credit Lyonnais is lead manager with Citibank tipped as joint lead manager. Price talk is 200-210 basis points over U.S. Treasury notes.</p>
<p>The bond will be issued off the borrowers' Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) Programme.</p>
<p>The new three-year deal will offer a yield pick-up over the previous dollar bond, which Banco Bansud launched last November.</p>
<p>The $100 million December 1999, 9.25 percent, bond was priced to yield 365 b.p. over and was last trading at around 190 b.p. bid, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The tight spread is a reflection of the market. Generally spreads have been tightening aggressively within Latin America," an emerging market dealer said.</p>
<p>Last week, Moody's Investors Service downgraded Banco Bansud's financial strength rating to E+ from D.</p>
<p>At the same time, the rating agency confirmed the bank's long-term foreign currency bond and deposit ratings of B1.</p>
