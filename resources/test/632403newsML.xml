<p>The Straits Times newspaper trumpeted new figures on Monday that showed Singapore's crime rate is lower than Malaysia's, the latest salvo in a war of words that has seriously damaged relations.</p>
<p>Singapore's leading daily newspaper said the just-released 1997 edition of the World Competitiveness Yearbook "reports that Malaysia's crime rate has shot up and surpassed that of Singapore".</p>
<p>The statistics show Singapore with 37.4 serious crimes per 100,000 population in 1994 against 46.4 for Malaysia. In 1993, the figures were 13.2 for Malaysia against 43.8 for Singapore.</p>
<p>The yearbook is published by the Swiss-based International Institute for Management Development.</p>
<p>The 1993 numbers, from the 1996 edition of the yearbook, had been used earlier in Malaysian newspapers as evidence that Malaysia was safer than Singapore. That was part of a running dispute with Singapore which has been simmering for months.</p>
<p>It began when former Singapore prime minister Lee Kuan Yew said in a court affidavit made public early this year that Malaysia's Johor Bahru was "notorious for shootings, muggings and car-jackings", sparking a heated response from Malaysia.</p>
<p>Lee subsequently apologised and withdrew the remarks.</p>
<p>The Straits Times, however, used information presented by Lee to the court for an article suggesting that reports about crime in Johor, across a narrow strait from Singapore, would indeed have led people to conclude crime was a problem there.</p>
<p>That sparked fresh complaints from Malaysia, and a barrage of claims and counter-claims about crime rates.</p>
<p>The dispute has spilled over into other areas, including tourism, investment and shipping. The two countries "are going through difficult bilateral relations," Singapore Foreign Minister Shanmugan Jayakumar said on Saturday.</p>
