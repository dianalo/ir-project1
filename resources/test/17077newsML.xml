<p>Barrick Gold Corp said on Tuesday its takeover offer for Arequipa Resources Ltd was successful, with 93 percent of the 36.3 million shares not already owned tendered under the bid, which expired overnight.</p>
<p>"We are pleased that Arequipa shareholders ahave chosen so overwhelmingly to accept this offer. We now have the opportunity to realize the potential of Arequipa's excellent assets," Barrick chairman and chief executive Peter Munk said in a statement.</p>
<p>The C$30-a-share deal means Barrick will own Arequipa's attractive Pierina gold deposit in Peru.  </p>
<p>Barrick said details involving the allocation between Barrick shares and cash will be available shortly.</p>
<p>Barrick's offer of C$30 a share or part cash, part share offer was Barrick's second attempt to swallow the small Vancouver-based gold prospector.</p>
<p>Toronto-based Barrick, the world's third largest gold producer, sweetened its July 11 bid to C$30 a share from C$27 on August 16 after a fresh batch of drill results from the Pierina deposit.</p>
<p>Experts have speculated the deposit has potential reserves of up to 12 million ounces. More drilling results are expected soon.</p>
<p>The Barrick bid took observers by surprise, since Arequipa's exploration was still in its early stages.</p>
<p>Arequipa shareholders had the option to choose C$30 cash or 0.79 Barrick shares plus 50 cents for each Arequipa share.</p>
<p>Shares were to be pro-rated if more than 14.4 million were requested.</p>
