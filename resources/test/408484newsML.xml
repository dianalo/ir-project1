<p>A group of top U.S. business leaders said Wednesday that they saw virtually no likelihood that the economy's steady expansion was about to be undermined by inflation.</p>
<p>"There is no inflation anywhere," said John Welch, chaimran of General Electric Co., at a press conference following a session of the Business Council, an influential group of chief executives in industries from manufacturing to banking.</p>
<p>A survey completed by 72 of the Business Council's 175 members showed 90 percent of them anticipate the economy will expand between 1.5 percent and 2.5 percent in 1997 and nearly two-thirds expect interest rates to remain stable.</p>
<p>Douglas Warner, chairman of J.P. Morgan and Co. Inc., said the survey showed the corporate chieftains shared "an upbeat and optimistic view of the world, a steady-as-she-goes view of the economy."</p>
<p>The Business Council members were meeting as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan told Congress that he was concerned that that U.S. stock prices may have risen too far. Greenspan suggested central bank policymakers might raise interest rates before inflation heats up in order to sustain the six-year-old expansion.</p>
<p>But Lawrence Bossidy, chairman of AlliedSignal Inc. and also chairman of the Business Council, said competition generated by global markets was helping keep prices under control.</p>
<p>"I don't see any of the excesses that I know the chairman of the Federal Reserve worries about," Bossidy said, at least not in the economy's industrial sector.</p>
<p>Warner of J.P. Morgan said that while inflation was not seen as a rising threat, there were some developments in global financial markets that warranted concern. He said there has been "a tightening of credit risk" and that investors' premium for assuming risk "may indeed have become too low."</p>
<p>Kenneth Derr, chairman of Chevron Corp., pointed out that energy prices that had run up late last year were falling sharply and so removing another are of worry about inflation.</p>
<p>Derr predicted imported oil prices would stabilise at $20- $21 a barrel in 1997 and said that natural gas prices had dropped by about one-half in just the past three weeks.</p>
<p>The chairman of Ford Motor Co., Alex Trotman, said domestic automakers foresaw new-vehicle sales at around 15 million to 15-1/2 million units in 1997, which he termed "pretty healthy" and added he also saw no price inflation.</p>
<p>Trotman expressed some concern about the dollar's appreciation against the Japanese yen, saying it had helped Japan ship 60,000 more new cars to the United States in the fourth quarter last year than in the comparable final three months of 1995.</p>
<p>The survey of chief executives showed more than half did not anticipate wage and salary costs would go up more in 1997 than in 1996. Nearly two-thirds said employee medical costs would hold steady.</p>
<p>Welch said that gains in output per worker were lowering real costs for corporations. He said "enormous productivity increases ... mean wages are going up but costs are coming down."</p>
