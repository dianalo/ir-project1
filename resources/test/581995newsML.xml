<p>The Mauritian rupee firmed against the dollar and weakened against sterling on Wednesday reflecting international trends, foreign exchange dealers said.</p>
<p>The rupee was fixed at a commercial mean rate of 20.4445 to the dollar from 20.4705 on Tuesday, and at a commercial mean rate of 33.364 against the sterling from 33.2245 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Forex dealers said that the central bank had been seen selling dollars on the foreign exchange interbank market at the prevailing interbank rate on Tuesday mid afternoon.</p>
<p>"Despite (the) central bank's interventions on Monday and Tuesday, commercial banks are still having hard currency shortage positions," a dealer said.</p>
