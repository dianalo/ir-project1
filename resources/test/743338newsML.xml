<headline>Mexico stocks plunge amid Q2 earnings woes.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-07-21</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks eased off late falls but still posted their sharpest percentage drop since Jan. 6 at the close Monday.</p>
<p>Dealers and analysts said investors sold blue chips amid concerns second-quarter corporate earnings due in the coming days would not live up to earlier encouraging forecasts.</p>
<p>"I feel investors are now a little more moderate and waiting to see whether earnings really will be good, or not," said Gerardo Copca, an analyst at the Finamex brokerage.</p>
<p>The leading IPC share index ended down 130.34 points, or 2.76 percent, at 4,590.22.</p>
<p>"The first crop of earnings reports last week were good, but the latest ones have been disappointing," Copca added. "We still need to see whether good macroeconomic figures will filter through to company earnings."</p>
<p>Trading volume of 55 million shares was very slow due to market jitters, traders said, adding an initial public offering accounted for 13.8 million of that total.</p>
<p>Analysts said the market slid due to more to domestic factors than was the case last week.</p>
<p>"Brazil definitely had an impact all last week,"said Jose Gomez, an analyst with the Value brokerage. "But today it was definitely internal factors; the market was very nervous."</p>
<p>The Bovespa index of most active stocks traded in Sao Paulo, Brazil, ended the session up 0.98 percent at 11,292 points.</p>
<p>Dealers said telecommunications firm Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), financial firm Bancomer and retailer Cifra led the slide. The three stocks together accounted for about one-half of all shares traded, not counting an IPO.</p>
<p>Market heavyweight Telmex ended down 44 centavos (5.5 cents) at 19.46 pesos ($2.47), while its American Depositary Receipts bucked the mild upward trend on Wall Street to end down 1-1/16 at 49-1/4.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones industrial average, meanwhile, ended up 16.26 points at 7,906.72.    Bancomer B shares dropped 20 centavos (2.5 cents) to 4.30</p>
<p>pesos (55 cents), while Cifra closed down 18 centavos (2 cents) at 14.84 pesos ($1.88).</p>
<p>Traders said illiquid stocks and market stragglers dominated the short gainers' list.</p>
<p>On the broad market, sliders far outpaced gainers by 74 to 10 out of 99 stocks traded in total.</p>
