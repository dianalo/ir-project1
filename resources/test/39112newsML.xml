<p>Polish Prime Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said he fired Trade Minister Jacek Buchacz because he ill-managed state funds, notably planning to transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to a private Ukrainian bank.</p>
<p>Cimoszewicz said in a televised address late on Saturday Buchacz had ignored clear cabinet orders to stop guaranteeing export credits with state assets at his disposal and strived to move the credit guarantee system outside government control.</p>
<p>"The dismissal is not about a personal or political conflict. It is about protecting important state interests and clear rules of managing state assets," Cimoszewicz said.</p>
<p>"Buchacz was told by the cabinet in December 1995 not to use state assets to guarantee export credits any further, but a ...probe showed he made several decisions to implement such a system which would be outside government control."</p>
<p>Cimoszewicz said a probe by the Supreme Audit Chmaber (NIK) and the Council of Ministers showed companies Buchacz created to guarantee credits had been consistently bringing losses.</p>
<p>They also showed the ministry did not have control over the funds it supplied to the companies, which were partially privately owned and managed.</p>
<p>"The council of ministers probe established that export credit guarantee programmes accepted by the minister were created outside the ministry," Cimoszewicz said.</p>
<p>"It is especially peculiar that in each case where state and private capital were mixed, the privatly-owned stock was always represented by the same person, closely cooperating with the minister," he said.</p>
<p>The abrupt Wednesday dismissal of Buchacz, a member of the smaller Peasant Party (PSL) in the left-wing coalition by Cimoszewicz from the bigger post-communist Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), prompted an angry uproar from the peasants.</p>
<p>PSL threatened to quit the coalition saying the unexpected sacking was a clear breech of the coalition agreement. They demanded an apology and other concessions including changes to the draft budget for 1997 if they were to stay.</p>
<p>Cimoszewicz said he understood the abruptness of his decision hurt PSL's feelings but that, in the circumstances, he had no choice.</p>
<p>He said the president of Poland's biggest chemical trader Ciech SA, in which the treasury holds a 53 percent stake, wrote to him that he had been increasingly pressured by Buchacz to sign documents in conflict with Ciech board's resolutions.</p>
<p>The foreign trade minister exercises ownership rights in state-owned foreign trade companies, including Ciech.</p>
<p>"The president of...Ciech SA...wrote to me...that for several months, Buchacz and his advisor Piotr Bykowski have been increasing pressure on him...to sign documents prepared without the knowledge and approval of the board," he said.</p>
<p>"The documents were in conflict with resolutions voted by the company's management," he said.</p>
<p>"Ciech president said that the (minister's) handling of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of state assets with the intention of transferring them to a private bank in the Ukraine made him speak up in protest," Cimoszewicz said.</p>
<p>He said that facing resistance to his export guarantee and chemical sector consolidation plans at the Ciech supervisory board meeting last week, Buchacz called for an extraordinary shareholders meeting to change the board and management.</p>
<p>"These are...reasons why I treated the decision (on the dismissal of Buchacz) as an urgent matter. No decision could mean passive acceptance for actions which threatened the state treasury with losses," Cimoszewicz said.</p>
