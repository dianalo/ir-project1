<p>Countries which put European Union-funded research to military use should be forced to return the money, the European Parliament said on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a report on future EU science and technology policy, Euro-MPS said they objected to all use of EU research funds to develop weapons.</p>
<p>Parliament said the EU's fifth research framework programme, which will structure EU research at the start of the 21st century, should be clearly market-oriented.</p>
<p>The programme should focus on helping small and medium-sized enterprises as well as big industry and should do more to ensure the results of basic research were transformed into patentable technologies, Euro-MPs said.</p>
