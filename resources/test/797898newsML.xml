<p>Australian cables maker Metal Manufactures Ltd plans to expand into more Asian markets to take advantage of expected growth in the telecommunications sector, managing director Glenn Dudley said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We are looking at other markets in Southeast Asia. We have checked all of those areas and we see significant growth in their data and cable requirements over the next five years," Dudley told Reuters in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Metal Manufactures earlier reported a 20.3 percent fall in net profit to A$15.70 million for the six months to June 30.  </p>
<p>Dudley said the 1997 second half would result in an improved performance for the company, which is 61.2 percent owned by BICC Plc of Britain.</p>
<p>"The Asian markets generally are starting to come to terms with telecommunication requirements for the future.</p>
<p>"We are looking at China, there is potential for us to move in there as well as south east Asia," Dudley said.</p>
<p>"We are looking at a couple of opportunities at the moment and when we conclude those arrangements, will be making some announcements," he said.  </p>
<p>Metal Manufactures has plants in Thailand and Indonesia through its BICC Cables Asia-Pacific power and energy cables joint venture.</p>
<p>The partnership has a second venture called BICCOR, which is 60 percent-owned by BICC Cables Asia-Pacific and 40 percent by Corning Inc.</p>
<p>Dudley said the first half result was reflected by lower demand for telecommunications cable in Australia, in part due to the slowdown in the cable rollout programme by local carriers.</p>
<p>"But we have long term confidence that the requirements for optical fibre cable will grow in Australia.  </p>
<p>"Having said that we are not anticipating any significant change in the second half," he said.</p>
<p>"We see more telecommunications growth coming from our offshore markets than the domestic market," Dudley said.</p>
<p>Metal Manufactures also reported a lower interim dividend of five cents compared with six cents a year earlier. Dudley said this reflected the performance of the first half and did not indicate the prospects for the second half.</p>
<p>At 1.05 p.m. (0305 GMT), Metal Manufactures shares were seven cents lower at A$3.08.</p>
