<p>Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda faced almost certain defeat in a confidence vote in parliament on Friday amid signs his coalition and the Congress party were searching for a new leader to avert snap polls.</p>
<p>The prime minister put the motion of confidence before the 542-member lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha, and defended his 10-month-old government's record in an address that sounded more like a resignation speech than a rallying cry.</p>
<p>"I would like this House to ponder on the last 10 months where this government has gone wrong and betrayed the assurances given to the nation," he said.</p>
<p>The prime minister's fate appeared sealed when negotiations between his 15-party United Front coalition and Congress ended in deadlock on Thursday.</p>
<p>The United Front refused to buckle under Congress pressure to abandon Deve Gowda, who was propelled into power last June after inconclusive general elections.</p>
<p>Congress, hoping for a split in the centre-left governing coalition that would allow it to claim power, stood by its demand that Deve Gowda resign.</p>
<p>Waiting in the wings was the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which led the nation for 12 days last year and would like to go to the polls again to strengthen its chances of recapturing power.</p>
<p>The political situation remained fluid, but there were signs Deve Gowda's coalition was prepared to put forward a new leader once the prime minister was defeated in the confidence vote.</p>
<p>BJP leader Jaswant Singh told the Lok Sabha: "Before the commencement of the debate, sir, the air was thick with rumours about the resignation of the honourable prime minister, that there has been a last minute change and that the partners in this arrangement have now settled the dispute."</p>
<p>"A compromise has been reached. Deve Gowda will step down," said Jayanthi Natarajan, a senior Congress deputy. "A new nominee from the United Front will head the government."</p>
<p>But parliamentarians said Deve Gowda had rejected a demand by a delegation of United Front leaders to step down, and insisted on facing the confidence motion.</p>
<p>The delegation included G.K. Moopanar, a former Congress member from Tamil Nadu state who broke away last year to form the Tamil Maanila Congress, part of the United Front.</p>
<p>Moopanar met the president late on Thursday, fanning speculation he would emerge as the consensus United Front candidate to replace Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>Lawmakers said the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh state, Chandrababu Naidu, could also emerge as a replacement.</p>
<p>Politicians said United Front and Congress leaders were holding out the hope that they could cobble together a fresh government after Deve Gowda fell and avert snap elections that could propel the BJP back into power.</p>
<p>A failure by the United Front and Congress to put together a new government could pave the way for the second general election in a year or a period of uncertainty as parties struggled to patch together a new majority.</p>
<p>The political crisis has held the business-friendly 1997/98 (April-March) budget hostage and unsettled financial markets. The Bombay bourse's key index was down more than one percent in early trade on Friday.</p>
<p>The speaker, P.A. Sangma, had scheduled eight hours of debate, and a vote was expected after 8 p.m. (1430 GMT).</p>
<p>Deve Gowda would need a simple majority of members present and voting to survive, but the arithmetic appeared stacked against him.</p>
