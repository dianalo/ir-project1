<p>British Telecommunications Plc on Thursday declined to comment specifically on whether its chief executive, Sir Peter Bonfield, had met the chairman of Germany's Veba for talks about a possible alliance.</p>
<p>"We talk to a lot of people all the time," said a BT spokeswoman, adding: "If there were talks, we really wouldn't comment on the nature of them."</p>
<p>Bonfield was an "extremely busy chap", she said, spending one week in Japan and the next in Europe. She noted that it was "highly possible" that he had been in Germany on Wednesday, but she could not confirm it.  </p>
<p>Germany's Berliner Zeitung reported that Veba chairman Ulrich Hartmann had met BT's chief for secret talks. Veba and its partner RWE are searching for a new international telecoms partner since Britain's Cable and Wireless last week pulled out of the partnership.</p>
<p>BT already has an alliance in Germany with utility Viag, with which it wants to launch an attack on dominant phone company Deutsche Telekom's lucrative market share when competition is allowed around 1998.</p>
