<p>Under a collaboration agreement signed in October, Nextran made an up-front payment and an equity investment in Cytel for the right to enter into an exclusive supply agreement for the carbohydrate with Cytel's Glycotechnology business unit.</p>
<p>The agreement provides for further product development milestone payments to Cytel. Xenotransplantation is the process of transplanting animal organs into humans.</p>
