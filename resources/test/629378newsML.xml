<p>Republican Sen. John Ashcroft urged President Bill Clinton on Saturday to work for a change in employment laws to permit companies to offer workers time off instead of overtime pay.</p>
<p>In the Republicans' weekly radio response to the president, the Missouri lawmaker said federal workers now have rights to flexible work schedules that are illegal in the private sector. In some cases, federal workers work 80 hours in 9 days and take an extra day off every two weeks, he noted.</p>
<p>The Senate is to resume debate on the compensatory time legislation when it returns next week from the Memorial Day recess.</p>
<p>"Our plan has very strong protection for worker rights and penalties for employer coercion are doubled," Ashcroft said in addressing a key point made by the opposition that it could lead employers to force workers to take time off rather than pay overtime.</p>
<p>Ashcroft urged Clinton also to discuss the issues with organised labour, the chief opponents of the plan. "But to reach a bipartisan agreement that helps workers and families, the president must move promptly ...to get lobbyists for unions to stop tyring to kill flextime."</p>
<p>In his address he outlined benefits of more time off for parents with small children and others who would like a more flexible work schedule.</p>
