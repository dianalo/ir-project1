<p>India should implement a phased decontrolling of its oil sector by the year 2002, a government-appointed panel said on Friday.</p>
<p>Reforms of the hydrocarbon sector should be launched in three phases, with total deregulation of upstream and downstream sectors by the year 2000-2002, the Strategic Planning Group said in its report.</p>
<p>It said the government should announce its decision to deregulate the sector within the specified timeframe and appoint a panel to suggest ways to restructure prices.</p>
<p>The group, headed by the highest-ranking civil servant in the ministry of petroleum and natural gas, submitted its report to Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda on Thursday.</p>
<p>A summary of the report was obtained by Reuters on Friday. The group, set up last year, included experts from the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>As part of economic reforms launched in 1991, the government has opened domestic oilfields for exploration by private and foreign participation. It has allowed free import and marketing of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), kerosene and lubricants and cut import duty on oil products.</p>
<p>The group said the first phase should begin between 1996 and 1998 and cover rationalisation of the tariff structure, deregulation of natural gas pricing and of of furnace oil and bitumen, and partial decontrol of the marketing.</p>
<p>It suggested removal of subsidies on high speed diesel and cut in subsidies on kerosene, LPG and input for fertilisers.</p>
<p>Reforms between 1998 and 2000 should include pricing of indigenous crude on the basis of the fob price of comparable imported crudes, rationalisation of royalty and cess, and reduction of subsidies on kerosene, LPG and input for fertilisers.</p>
<p>The report said the final phase in 2000-2002 should cover deregulation of aviation turbine fuel, high speed diesel and motor spirit and total deregulation of upstream and downstream sectors of the oil sector.</p>
<p>"In order to provide the right signal to private investors, government should make a policy pronouncement declaring its intention to deregulate the hydrocarbon sector within the speicfied time-frame," it added.</p>
<p>The panel said the government should also announce appointment of an experts' group on the import tariff reforms.</p>
<p>It said the success of the reform programme would largely depend on efficient management of the transition period and pursuing a transparent policy.</p>
<p>"With appropriate levels of domestic taxes, import tariffs, cess and royalties, it is entirely feasible that the reform package is budget-neutral," it said.</p>
<p>The group said the decontrol would increase efficiency and reduce the cost by setting up a competitive and investment friendly market structure.</p>
<p>"In order to achieve the primary objective of securing oil supplies to meet the future growing demand, it would be absolutely necessary to move towards a market-driven price mechanism and to free the petroleum sector from APM (administered price mechanism)."</p>
