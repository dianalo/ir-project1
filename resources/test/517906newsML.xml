<p>A French court will rule on April 25 on a challenge to British Airways' move to manage its French carriers TAT and Air Liberte as a joint unit, union sources said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The unions challenged the move, implemented on April 1, saying BA had not consulted the staff councils at the two airlines. The case is being heard by a court in the Paris suburb of Creteil.</p>
<p>Cockpit crews have been on strike for the past nine days to protest BA's cost-cutting measures to bring the carriers to profitability. It acquired Air Liberte in January and plans eventually to merge it with TAT.</p>
<p>TAT-Air Liberte said it could guarantee only 40 percent of scheduled flights on Friday. It has called an extraordinary staff council meeting on Friday to discuss the situation of the company.</p>
