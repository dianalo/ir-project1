<p>Samsung Electronics Co, the world's leading memory chip maker, on Wednesday denied news reports that it was negotiating a deal to sell a stake in its U.S. unit to Toshiba Corp of Japan.  </p>
<p>"The article is totally groundless," said a Samsung spokesman, referring to a report in the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, a Japanese economic daily.</p>
<p>The paper said on Wednesday that Toshiba would buy a 20 percent stake in Samsung Austin Semiconductor Inc, which Samsung Electronics is constructing in Texas.</p>
<p>It also said Toshiba would receive 20 percent of the 64-megabit dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips the plant would produce.</p>
