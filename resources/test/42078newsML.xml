<title>GERMANY: No quick deal seen in Lufthansa wage talks.</title>
<headline>No quick deal seen in Lufthansa wage talks.</headline>

<p>Wage talks at Deutsche Lufthansa AG started on Monday with wide differences of opinion between the airline and its main unions, both of which have already rejected the airline's call for a pay freeze.</p>
<p>Lufthansa, up against tough competition and a price war in its main markets, has already said that it believed sector conditions meant that it should in principle be seeking to cut its overall wage costs.</p>
<p>Unions were further alarmed by press reports that the airline was interested in putting out some of its services to franchise, thus reducing its headcount of permanent staff.</p>
<p>German white collar union DAG said it would be demanding a four percent pay rise in the talks and would reject any moves towards the franchising of services and the shifting of some of its activities to cheaper wage-cost centres abroad.</p>
<p>Transport and public sector union OeTV said last week it would be negotiating for a 12-month wage pact based around 2.3 percent rise in wages and said it would be asking for a strengthening of guarantees on jobs protection.</p>
<p>Lufthansa however insists that it could only provide guarantees within a settlement that would allow it to plan staff costs three years ahead.</p>
