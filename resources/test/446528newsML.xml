<p>Although year earnings per share fell six percent in 1996, South Africa's Anglo American Industrial Corp (Amic) said most operations enjoyed a robust second half year and it looked forward to raising earnings in 1997.</p>
<p>"It had us worried, but hopefully the cycle we're in has this (1996) as the weakest year. All indications are for a real increase in earnings in 1997. Most operations had a very strong second half," Amic chairman Leslie Boyd said on Monday.</p>
<p>Amic announced headline earnings per share for the year ended December 31 of 1,476 cents compared to 1,569 cents previously and lower than analysts' consensus forecast of 1,498.75 cents per share.</p>
<p>The group held its total dividend steady at 545 cents.</p>
<p>Boyd said that in the year ahead Amic would focus increasingly on sustainable competitive advantages and on further global opportunities.</p>
<p>Last August Amic and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp announced a 100 million rand investment fund joint venture and in January this year Amic signed a joint venture with two more Japanese firms, Komatsu Ltd and Itochu Ltd.</p>
<p>"Throughout the Amic group we are very keen on these joint ventures with major partners," Boyd told a results presentation.</p>
<p>Asked whether Amic was considering unbundling in the future, Boyd said that it would not be beneficial to Amic's operations.</p>
<p>"If you haven't got big companies, you can't do big things. And if you can't do big things, then you can't compete in the global village," he said.</p>
