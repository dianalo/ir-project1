<p>Peru's business climate has not been hurt by the 58-day-old hostage siege at the Japanese ambassador's residence and United States investors should continue to invest here, the U.S. Embassy in Lima said.</p>
<p>"Despite the takeover of the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima, business activity has suffered no significant effects," the embassy said in a statement.</p>
<p>The country "continues to be a market which hold enormous potential for investors and traders, large and small," the statement, issued late Wednesday, said. "The time to look at the market is now."  </p>
<p>This confidence stems from President Alberto Fujimori's "disciplined economic program," which will enable the economy to grow five percent a year through the end of the century, with inflation below 10 percent, the statement said.</p>
<p>About 15 heavily armed Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrillas stormed the residence Dec 17 and seized more than 400 VIP cocktail party guests.</p>
<p>They have released all but 72 captives, including senior Peruvian officials and about two dozen Japanese businessmen and diplomats, including Tokyo's ambassador to the country.  </p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador Dennis Jett said U.S. firms are in the process of investing $2 billion in Peru's mining, oil and gas and tourism sectors and the hostage crisis is unlikely to stem the investment flow.</p>
<p>"Such an incident, even though it is serious, will not affect potential investors," Jett was quoted as saying in the U.S. Embassy statement.</p>
<p>The embassy said it also was expressing the view of the American Chamber of Commerce (AMCHAM) of Peru and the statement contained AMCHAM members' optimistic appraisal of the business outlook despite the hostage ordeal.  </p>
<p>AMCHAM counts 380 corporate clients with U.S. business interests here and the U.S. remains the leading partner with a 20-percent market share and will export more than $1 billion in goods and services this year.</p>
<p>"We view this siuation as temporary and unique," Susana Elespuru de Freitas, general manager of Proctor &amp; Gamble's local unit, was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>Coca Cola's local manager Marcial Mora said his firm "will continue to invest with our bottlers, and lead the beverages market in 1997, with a total planned investmentof approximately $60 million."</p>
<p>Charles Preble, president of ASARCO -owned copper miner Southern Peru Ltd, said the taking of the embassy is of concern but his company "continues to have confidence in Peru."</p>
<p>But one executive, Larry Smith, executive director of Bell South's TELE2000, struck a more somber note.</p>
<p>"While terrorist events occur, unfortunately all over the world, this particular hostage situation is most unfortunate and we can only hope that it resolves itself quickly and peacefully," he was quoted as saying.</p>
