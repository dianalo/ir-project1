<p>The Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Tuesday called for an immediate ceasefire among Cambodia's warring factions and for immediate steps to ensure the safety of foreign nationals.</p>
<p>"ASEAN is dismayed by and deeply regrets the unfortunate turn of events in Cambodia, resulting in the loss of innocent lives, both of Cambodian citizens and of foreigners," the seven-member grouping said in a statement. "ASEAN calls for an immediate ceasefire," it said. "ASEAN also calls upon the Government of Cambodia to take immediate steps to ensure the safety of foreign nationals and provide protection to their properties in that country."</p>
<p>It urged Cambodia's two warring prime ministers "to abide by the terms of the (1991) Paris Peace accords" which ended two-decades of civil war. ASEAN foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting on Thursday in Kuala Lumpur to discuss the crisis. Malaysia is currently chairman of ASEAN, which also groups Indonesia, Brunei, the Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam and Thailand.</p>
<p>Cambodia, which was plunged into turmoil following two days of fighting in the capital Phnom Penh over the weekend, was to join ASEAN later this month along with Burma and Laos. It has been ASEAN's ambition since it was founded to have all 10 Southeast Asian countries within its fold. But the collapse of Cambodia's troubled coalition government has thrown considerable doubt on the plan. Second Prime Minister Hun Sen has taken control of Phnom Penh and its outskirts, while his ousted rival, First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh, has vowed from France to organise resistance.</p>
<p>Singapore's Straits Times newspaper said in an editorial on Tuesday Cambodia's entry into ASEAN can wait. The pro-government English-language daily said the situation raises questions about who is really in charge of Cambodia and could speak for it when ASEAN meets on July 23 to formalise entry of Cambodia, Burma and Laos into the group.</p>
<p>The foreign ministers of Thailand and the Philippines said on Monday ASEAN may reconsider its decision to admit the three new members. Malaysia's acting Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said the ASEAN foreign ministers at the meeting on Thursday would review the decision to admit Cambodia.</p>
<p>"We're asking our Foreign Ministry to discuss with the other ASEAN foreign ministries the possibility of a change," he told reporters.</p>
<p>Malaysia's opposition leader Lim Kit Siang also said induction of the three new members should be deferred.</p>
<p>"The United Nations had sent more than 20,000 peacekeeping troops to Cambodia between 1991 and 1993 and spent more than $2 billion to organise elections to create a legitimate and democratic society -- but all these efforts seem to have gone down the drain," he said in a statement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The political stalemate has prevented Cambodia's National Assembly from meeting for more than two months to enact laws paving the way for the country's entry into ASEAN, he said.</p>
<p>But the Malaysian Business Times, which reflects government views, said in an editorial on Tuesday the Cambodian conundrum could best be solved if the country was within the ASEAN fold.</p>
<p>"ASEAN can, and probably will, play a key role in bringing the feuding parties in Cambodia to a compromise without anymore gunfire and violence," the newspaper said. "The vision of an ASEAN-10 must not be allowed to waver at this point in time."</p>
<p>A Western diplomat said of the editorial: "That argument can be made persuasively and not just by the Malaysians."</p>
<p>The political quake in Cambodia exposed possible fault lines in ASEAN as well, analysts and diplomats said.</p>
<p>Vietnam, which joined ASEAN in 1995, installed Hun Sen as head of a communist government after invading Cambodia in 1978 to end the "killing fields" regime of Pol Pot's Khmer Rouge.</p>
<p>Hun Sen visited Vietnam last week before making his move against Ranariddh but was on vacation and did not meet with any Vietnamese leaders, a foreign ministry spokesman in Hanoi said.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, ASEAN steadfastly supported an anti-Vietnamese coalition led by King Norodom Sihanouk that included his son Ranariddh's royalist faction and the Khmer Rouge. Vietnam is worried anti-Vietnamese sentiment may re-emerge in the wake of Hun Sen's takeover, analysts said.</p>
