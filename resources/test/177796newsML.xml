<p>East African peace mediator Julius Nyerere asked South African President Nelson Mandela on Saturday to contribute to a Zaire peace force but Mandela said he needed more information.</p>
<p>"Clearly we can't envisage a force, basically an African force, seeking assistance from the outside world, that does not have South Africa," Nyerere, former president of Tanzania, told reporters after meeting Mandela at the South African leader's Johannesburg home.</p>
<p>But Mandela said he needed specific details.</p>
<p>"We want to be part of Africa, not only geographically and politically but from the point of view of our commitment. I am waiting for specific information from (Nyerere). As soon as we get that information, we will be able to take a decision," he said.</p>
<p>The U.N. Security Council on Saturday called on U.N. members to lay the groundwork for a multinational force to help feed the hungry in eastern Zaire where fighting between Tutsi rebels and government forces has put hundreds of thousands Rwandan and Burundian refugees and Zaireans on the move.</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has spoken of "genocide by starvation" in eastern Zaire, was asked by the Security Council to draw up a "concept of operations and framework for a humanitarian task force".</p>
<p>Mandela declined to say what details he was seeking but Nyerere said he would provide them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Nyerere briefed Mandela on a summit of East and Central African leaders in Kenya last Tuesday where the crisis in Zaire was discussed.</p>
<p>One of the key decisions was that a neutral force be created to provide safe corridors for aid to more than a million refugees from ethnic violence in Rwanda and Burundi.</p>
<p>Nyerere said the force would help Rwandan refugees now in eastern Zaire to return to their home country.</p>
<p>"The region doesn't like the idea of these refugees being moved back to the camps. Because the nursing of these refugees in the camps has really been the nursing of the problem which has now burst out," he said.</p>
<p>South Africa decided on Wednesday to suspend an 87 million rand ($18.5 million) arms contract with the Rwandan government, agreed in September, in view of the fighting in the region.</p>
<p>Mandela said he had told his departments of foreign affairs and defence to work out options for contributing to the stabilisation of the Great Lakes region.</p>
<p>"But we are working in the dark," he said. "We don't have essential information...What is it that they want us to do? Precisely what form of assistance?"</p>
<p>South African government officials have said the country would like in principle to participate in African peacekeeping operations but feels the process of integrating soldiers from opposing sides in the apartheid war into one unifed defence force has not gone far enough.</p>
