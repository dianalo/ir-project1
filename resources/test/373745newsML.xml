<p>Italian shares faltered after a firmer start on Wednesday and drifted off throughout a subdued trading day to close lower with food group Parmalat and banking stocks weighing down on the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>The market started on a higher note encouraged by the dollar and domestic bonds, but not even a firmer opening on Wall Street could arrest the decline in prices.</p>
<p>"There's very little activity, with many investors happy to stay on the sidelines today," said one share trader.</p>
<p>The blue-chip Mib30 index ended off 0.69 percent at 18,587 while the all-share Mibtel closed down 0.68 percent at 12,490.</p>
<p>Italy's largest quoted food group Parmalat lost 7.25 percent to 2,495 lire on market talk that the group was planning a capital operation and also that its 1996 results would be below market expectations.</p>
<p>The group denied the market talk and after the market closed, it added in a statement that its 1996 were in line with expectations with 1996 turnover seen at around 5.5 trillion lire and operating profits at about 480 billion lire.</p>
<p>STET was one to gain after Treasury Minister Carlo Azeglio Ciampi said the government was hoping for a "hard core" of shareholders holding 10 percent of stock when privatised.</p>
<p>STET shares ended up 0.18 percent at 8,151 lire while its old offshoot yellow pages publisher Seat closed up 0.02 percent 625.8 lire following Treasury's announcement Tuesday there are six bidders including ITT and GTE in group's privatisation.</p>
<p>Mediaset continued to lose, off 1.31 percent at 7,259 lire following news of the Canal Plus bond on Tuesday convertible into Mediaset share, which was seen as a method of shareholder Nethold exiting from the Italian TV and advertising group.</p>
<p>Dealers pointed out that trading interest drifted off throughout the day ahead of tonight's World Cup soccer qualifier between England and Italy.</p>
