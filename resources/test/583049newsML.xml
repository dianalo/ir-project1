<p>The Anglo-French Intergovernmental Commission (IGC), which governs Channel Tunnel operator Eurotunnel, will not take a decision on the resumption of freight service before next week, an IGC source said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Traffic of heavy goods vehicle shuttle trains was interrupted after a fire broke out in the tunnel on November 18.</p>
<p>"The decision to resume freight traffic service has not yet been taken," the source said, adding: "Nothing will happen before next week. They (Eurotunnel) are not yet ready."</p>
<p>The source said the British delegation held up the approval.  </p>
<p>"The British delegation has some questions...(It) is following its minister," the source said.</p>
<p>John Prescott, deputy prime minister with responsibility for transport and the environment, has asked Eurotunnel for a precise schedule on carrying out the security committee's recommendations after the fire.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel had sought to resume freight traffic on May 15 and increase it gradually to reach full service by June 15.</p>
