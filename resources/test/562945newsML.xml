<p>Iraq said on Tuesday a Kuwaiti naval patrol killed a man fishing in Iraqi territorial waters in the Gulf.</p>
<p>"A Kuwaiti patrol consists of two boats opened fire against an Iraqi fishing boat carrying three people in Khour Abdullah in the Gulf...killing one of the Iraqi fishermen," the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.</p>
<p>The agency said Iraq informed the Arab League of the incident and urged it to "prevent Kuwait from doing such repeated and aggressive acts which contradict the League's charter".</p>
<p>INA said Iraq also wanted compensation for the incident which the agency did not say when it took place.</p>
<p>Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. The move prompted the U.S. to lead a multinational force that ejected Iraqi troops out of the emirates in the 1991 Gulf War.</p>
