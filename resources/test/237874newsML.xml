<headline>Chrysler raises dividend, share buyback.</headline>
<dateline>AUBURN HILLS, Mich. 1996-12-05</dateline>

<p>Chrysler Corp said Thursday its board had voted to increase the annual dividend to $1.60 a share from $1.40.</p>
<p>The new quarterly dividend of $0.40 a share is payable January 15, record December 15.</p>
<p>The automaker also increased its share buyback program to $2 billion for 1997 from $1 billion.  </p>
<p>Chrysler said it has now raised its dividend seven times in the past three years and has increased the payout by 433 percent since September 1993.</p>
<p>Chrysler said its share buyback program now totals $5 billion since it was started in 1995. Chrysler has repurchased 108 million shares under the program and had 714 million shares outstanding at the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>Since the $2 billion share buyback program for 1996 has been completed, Chrysler said the board had authorized it to begin the 1997 buyback program immediately, subject to market conditions.  </p>
<p>"The board has reviewed our long-range business plan and our projected outlook for 1997," Chrysler Chairman Robert Eaton said in a statement. "They are positive about the company's prospects and believe that, based on the current economic outlook, the increased dividend is sustainable and the buyback can be accomplished while the company continues to fund its aggressive product and marketing programs."</p>
<p>Chrysler said it will introduce several new vehicles in 1997, including the Dodge Durango sport utility vehicle, the Plymouth Prowler roadster, and the Chrysler Concorde and Dodge Intrepid sedans.  </p>
<p>It said it has a number of new vehicle programs under way for subsequent years.</p>
<p>"We've had outstanding results in 1996, from major product awards for our new Jeep vehicles and minivans to record sales and market share increases," Eaton said. "This is the right time to take these actions for our shareholders.</p>
<p>"We're confident about Chrysler's future and we know that we need to stay focused on controlling our costs and continually improving our processes and our products."</p>
