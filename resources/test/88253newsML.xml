<text>
<p>Plywood maker, U-Wood Holdings Bhd said on Tuesday it has received government approval to acquire the concession holder of a water privatisation scheme in Malaysia's Federal Territory and the central Selangor state.</p>
<p>The concession holder, Puncak Niaga (M) Sdn Bhd, will be acquired through funds raised from a rights issue, U-Wood said in a statement issued by its merchant bank.</p>
<p>U-Wood said the government's Economic Planning Unit (EPU) has approved the proposed rights issue of 40 million shares at 4.50 ringgit per share.</p>
<p>Both the acquisition and rights issue were submitted for approval in 1995.</p>
<p>Puncak Niaga, awarded the privatisation project a year earlier pending procedural approvals, will be fully responsible for managing and expanding water supply requirements in the Federal Territory of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor state.</p>
<p>U-Wood said the deal will now require approval from the Securities Commission.</p>
