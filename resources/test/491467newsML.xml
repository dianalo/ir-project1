<p>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Monday tried to force the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) onto the defensive for not having named a candidate to challenge him in the 1998 general election.</p>
<p>But the SPD, whose bitter leadership squabbles before elections have often made them an easy target for Kohl, refused to take the bait and stuck determinedly to their tactic of waiting until early next year before making a decision.</p>
<p>Kohl announced last week that he would run for a fifth term in 1998, ending speculation that he had lost his appetite to tackle mass unemployment and a huge budget deficit.</p>
<p>On Monday, loking relaxed after his Easter holiday, he agreed to SPD demands to meet their chairman Oskar Lafontaine for talks on tax reform -- but then quickly sank the knife in.</p>
<p>"Perhaps it will be of some use to Lafontaine in the fight over who will be the SPD's candidate," Kohl said.</p>
<p>But the SPD insisted there was no fight, and no need to decide on a candidate before next April -- almost certain to be either Lafontaine or Lower Saxony premier Gerhard Schroeder.</p>
<p>Lafontaine told reporters he was not worried by union leaders and SPD parliamentarians calling for an early decision to divert media pressure which is sure to focus on the issue.</p>
<p>And he made his own jab at Kohl, who has refused to commit himself to serving out another full term.</p>
<p>"As for whether the other big party will still have the same candidate in a year's time -- I wouldn't be too sure of that. At least you can be sure that whoever runs for us will certainly be prepared to serve for four years."</p>
<p>Commentators agree Kohl's move had one main purpose -- to lure the SPD, clear leaders in the opinion polls, into embroiling itself in internal squabbles.</p>
<p>"Kohl has managed, merely by announcing an expected decision, to put the SPD in a tight spot," commented the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung. "Whatever the SPD does now will be wrong."</p>
<p>Schroeder, ambitious and charismatic, has shown in the last two campaigns that he has no scruples about undermining his party leader when it suits him. He is also much more personally popular with voters than Lafontaine.</p>
<p>Schroeder on Monday renewed what has been a fairly solitary campaign among big-name politicians to make European monetary union an issue in next year's campaign, telling the Neue Ruhr Zeitung daily the question "cannot be made into a taboo".</p>
<p>But German voters elect parties, not leaders. And before the general election late next year, Schroeder has a difficult poll to contest in his home state of Lower Saxony in March 1998.</p>
<p>Even Schroeder has shown little interest in throwing his hat into the ring so early because this might make it hard for him to run in Lower Saxony -- and would weaken his position if he lost that election.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if Lafontaine decides now to use his right of first refusal, he will stand accused of pushing aside a more popular candidate with better chances.</p>
<p>But if he waits, he knows he is inviting the sniping which disrupted his own election campaign in 1990 and that of then-chairman Rudolf Scharping in 1994.</p>
<p>"If the SPD chairman really can manage to put off the decision about a challenger without letting the real issues suffer, that will be a masterful achievement," the Sueddeutsche Zeitung said.</p>
