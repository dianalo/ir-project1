<p>Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, condemned media reports on Sunday that a new truce by his IRA allies might last only four months and suggested the British secret services sought to undermine peace efforts.</p>
<p>"I think it is disgraceful journalism, I think it is totally irresponsible. It is the first that I have heard of this," Sinn Fein leader Adams told Belfast reporters.</p>
<p>Adams, whose party is poised for the first time to gain a seat at full-scale Northern Ireland talks in September if the truce holds, said such reports would be used as ammunition by pro-British Unionist opponents who did not want change.</p>
<p>He was speaking hours after the Irish Republican Army truce, announced on Saturday, took effect at midday, halting a 28-year war to end British rule in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>The Sunday Tribune, published in Dublin, reported that the IRA leadership had told its members that the ceasefire would last four months and would be renewed only if the province's peace process was seen to produce political benefits for Sinn Fein. It quoted unidentified "reliable sources".</p>
<p>London's Sunday Times, quoting republican and security sources, said the truce had been "sold to IRA members as a purely tactical manoeuvre which can be abandoned if necessary".</p>
<p>Adams told the CNN television network:"What you have to remember is that a lot of people have an agenda.</p>
<p>"Those in the British secret service and the intelligence services, those who want to treat this problem as a security problem have an agenda which is about destabilising this cessation," he said.</p>
<p>Britain, Ireland and the United States said the ceasefire opened the prospect of fresh start for the troubled province.</p>
<p>Politicians for the province's Protestant majority, who strongly back British links and oppose the IRA's aim of merging the region with with Catholic Ireland, are deeply suspicious of the guerrillas' motives. They are infuriated that the truce paves the way for Sinn Fein to enter settlement talks without any guerrilla arms being handed over.</p>
<p>David Trimble, head of the powerful Ulster Unionist Party, is due to have crunch talks with Minister Tony Blair in London to urge him to toughen demands for IRA disarament.</p>
<p>Peter Robinson, deputy head of the hardline Democratic Unionist Party, said newspaper reports had confirmed his scepticism.</p>
<p>"What we have according to our newspapers this morning is a ceasefire which will last for four months unless significant concessions are made to the Provos (IRA). That is not a ceasefire in any real sense," Robinson told Sky Television.</p>
<p>Adams called on Unionists politicians to lay aside their doubts and to "call a ceasefire in their minds" and join in negotiations to settle years of communal division.</p>
<p>Unionist parties are threatening to walk out of current multi-party talks, which exclude Sinn Fein, in protest at what they say are weak Anglo-Irish plans for achieving a surrender of guerrilla arms. Adams urged Unionists to be forward-thinking and build on the benefits of the ceasefire.</p>
<p>"This is the first day of the possibility of a new era...It will only happen if we seize the moment and build upon the momentus decision that has been taken by the IRA and if we build a proper foundation for proper talks through real negotations."</p>
