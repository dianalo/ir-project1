<p>The Zimbabwean government, in an attempt to end a three-week strike by civil servants which has paralysed essential services, offered on Wednesday to reinstate thousands of workers it fired over the stoppage.</p>
<p>Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Florence Chitauro said in a statement anyone who failed to report to work by Wednesday would be dismissed.</p>
<p>"Notwithstanding the fact that the civil servants took part in an illegal strike, government has now resolved that all the civil servants who had been dismissed be reinstated with effect from... the 4th of September," Chitauro said.</p>
<p>However, on Wednesday morning thousands of the strikers, who include doctors, nurses, mortuary attendants and prosecutors, streamed to a central park in the capital Harare, saying they were waiting to be addressed by their leaders on the government's climbdown.</p>
<p>The government last week offered the strikers -- who are demanding wage rises of between 30 and 60 percent -- a 20 percent pay increase in addition to a nine percent award which the workers had rejected as inadequate when they stopped work on August 20.</p>
