<p>Romario is back and Paolo Maldini now captains Italy, who meet world champions Brazil in a repeat of the 1994 World Cup final on Sunday.</p>
<p>The pair will renew a rivalry that ended in stalemate after 120 minutes of their Los Angeles showdown and was resolved with Brazil winning their fourth world title on penalties.</p>
<p>The timing of the new clash between Brazil and Italy in the fourth match of the four-team Tournoi de France in Lyon is significant even if it suits Romario more than Maldini.</p>
<p>Romario, 31, is in love with the game again after his much publicised comings and goings between clubs on opposite sides of the Atlantic and his predilection for beach football and partying led to a big loss of form.</p>
<p>He is back to his best, scoring regularly for Flamengo in Rio de Janeiro although on loan from Valencia of Spain.</p>
<p>Romario played his first match for Brazil since the 1994 World Cup final against Poland in February and has now scored six goals in five internationals this year.</p>
<p>"I really enjoyed playing this game," Romario said after Brazil drew 1-1 with hosts France in Tuesday's opening match of the tournament, a dress rehearsal for next year's World Cup finals.</p>
<p>"It was an excellent game. It's the style of football that we have to play, the game we are used to playing," he added after Brazil recovered from a lacklustre, shock 4-2 defeat to Norway in Oslo on Friday.</p>
<p>Coach Mario Zagallo has promised Brazil will defend their world title playing their traditional open, attacking game based on the ball skills of their many gifted players and this has inspired Romario to seek another world crown.</p>
<p>Maldini, 29 later this month, is at the height of his considerable powers and leader of an Italian team reinvigorated by father Cesare.</p>
<p>But, unlike Brazil, who with hosts France go automatically into the World Cup finals, Italy are involved in the qualifying competition in the same group as England, the other participants in the Tournoi de France.</p>
<p>"I'm not criticising the quality of the plate being served at the Tournoi de France, we're going to meet the cream of world football," Maldini said as Italy prepared to face the English in the second match of the tournament in Nantes on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"But, precisely, we ought to be able to line up our best team, which will not be the case."</p>
<p>When Maldini lines up against the Brazilians, however, he will forget that Italy have left key players at home because of injury or exhaustion at the end of a demanding season and the continuing demise of the great AC Milan team he played in.</p>
<p>He will look to neutralise the twin threat of Romario and Ronaldo, who hinted on Tuesday at the makings of an even more effective strike partnership than that which Romario enjoyed with Bebeto in 1994.</p>
<p>Maldini, now the senior player in the Italian side in terms of experience and honours with Franco Baresi finally out of the picture, will also want to add his accustomed weight in attack against a suspect Brazilian defence.</p>
<p>It is part of his preparation for another bid at the trophy that Maldini, who has five Italian league championships, three European Cups and two world club titles under his belt, most covets.</p>
<p>He has come very close to the World Cup with third place in his home country in 1990 and a runners-up medal in 1994.</p>
<p>"I don't want to end my career without winning a trophy with the national team," he said recently. "I'm tired of honourable placings."</p>
