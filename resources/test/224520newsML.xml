<p>Honours were just about even at the close of the first day's play in the four-day Supersport Series match between Transvaal and Boland at the Wanderers.</p>
<p>Put into bat after morning play was not possible due to overnight rain, Transvaal finished the day on 206 for five.</p>
<p>Slow left-arm spinner Claude Henderson saved his captain's blushes for an odd insertion with three wickets, including Transvaal's two top scorers, Adam Bacher and Neil McKenzie. Henderson finished with three for 76 from 29 overs.</p>
<p>Bacher took his season's first-class aggregate to 380 from only three innings with a well-constructed 58. But after hitting nine boundaries from 122 balls, Bacher lifted a cover drive and was comfortably caught by Elmar Liebenberg.</p>
<p>McKenzie, who added 70 runs for the second wicket with Bacher, played some quality strokes in an innings of 80. But he too fell to the wiles of Henderson, failing to clear deep extra cover with a lofted drive. McKenzie hit 13 boundaries from 152 balls.</p>
<p>Medium pacer Roger Telemachus made up for several wayward spells by picking up two wickets in the final session. Transvaal captain Ken Rutherford was brilliantly caught by Liebenberg at second slip for five, and the same fielder snared his fourth catch of the day to remove Nic Pothas for 12.</p>
