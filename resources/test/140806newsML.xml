<p>Whether the New York Yankees win or lose in the World Series, the big question on the minds of many fans is whether the team will abandon the famed stadium in the city's beleaguered Bronx borough.</p>
<p>For months, it seemed certain that Yankees principal owner George Steinbrenner would carry out his threat to leave the Bronx, a section of the city he has criticised as so decayed and dangerous that fans are scared away.</p>
<p>Bronx Borough President Fernando Ferrer this week renewed his oft-made call to keep baseball's "Bronx Bombers" in their home of 73 years. And a group of citizens has sued the club's owners and the city, arguing that such icons as the Yankee logo and name are owned by the city's eight million residents and should not be moved.</p>
<p>Ferrer, a politician who has fought to stop Steinbrenner from moving the club to New Jersey or Manhattan, said the 1996 clash with the defending champion Atlanta Braves that will be decided at Yankee Stadium this weekend is a chance for the world to take a fresh look at the borough the Yankees call home.</p>
<p>"This Series will smash a lot of stereotypes of the Bronx," he said recently as he ushered a group of reporters on a tour of the South Bronx, where the stadium is located.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, the South Bronx was the foremost U.S. symbol of urban decay, ravaged by arson fires, crime-filled streets, abandoned buildings and people suffering from poverty and drug abuse.</p>
<p>During the 1977 World Series, as television cameras covering the Yankees clash with the Los Angeles Dodgers panned over a building engulfed in flames, sports commentator Howard Cosell uttered the now-immortal words, "The Bronx is burning."</p>
<p>"The Bronx hasn't been burning for a long time," Ferrer said. "You see a community very different from the one that hosted" the series three times between 1977 and 1981.</p>
<p>Not far from the stadium, known as the "House that Ruth Built" after legendary home-run hitter Babe Ruth, is the faded elegance of the broad Grand Concourse, where the borough's wealthiest residents once lived. Nearby shops on bustling streets sport as many signs in Spanish as in English.</p>
<p>An ambitious housing programme in the South Bronx under Democratic Mayors Ed Koch and David Dinkins in the 1980s and early 1990s transformed the worst part of the borough, reduced crime and made some neighbourhoods liveable again.</p>
<p>But the South Bronx is still blighted with vacant lots and boarded-up buildings. By day the streets bustle with working-class and middle-income families, but by night there is still crime, although the borough's most dangerous neighbourhoods are well north of the Stadium. Police statistics show crime in the stadium's vicinity is relatively low.</p>
<p>Ferrer, a Democrat who is expected to run against Republican Mayor Rudolph Giuliani next year, said his $488 million proposal to redevelop the current stadium site would save hundreds of millions of dollars. He has promoted several plans to keep the Yankees, but Steinbrenner has panned them, encourging other politicians to make a pitch for the club.</p>
<p>Steinbrenner has delayed his decision on the move until after the series. One of his options is a consultant's plan, released in April, to build a $1.06 billion multipurpose stadium with retractable dome on Manhattan's West Side.</p>
<p>Giuliani has maintained that he would like the Yankees to stay in the Bronx but he has also said the Manhattan plan is feasible and could be financed.</p>
<p>Yankee Stadium's lease runs out in 2002 and Steinbrenner has also been wooed by New Jersey authorities, leaving the prospect of three major New York sports teams playing their home games in the neighbouring state. Two National Football League clubs, the New York Giants and the New York Jets, play at a stadium in the Meadowlands 10 miles away in New Jersey.</p>
<p>"He's commented about the enormous excitement generated by the Yankees' win, it has been extraordinary," Steinbrenner's spokesman Howard Rubenstein said. "He hasn't seen anything quite like this. That's very encouraging about New York."</p>
<p>A group of citizens, The Eternal Vigilance Society, filed papers in Bronx Supreme Court seeking an injunction to prevent the removal of the Yankees because their name and stature were part of the city, in effect the property of its residents.</p>
<p>"But whichever way the World Series goes Steinbrenner, being the great manipulator that he is, will come up with a story, win or lose," said the group's lawyer John Iannuzzi.</p>
