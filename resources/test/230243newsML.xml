<p>Information Resources Inc said Tuesday its business in Europe should get a boost now that AC Nielsen Corp has agreed to end restrictions on retailers' freedom to supply data to other companies.</p>
<p>As reported earlier Tuesday, Nielsen signed an undertaking with the European Commission agreeing to halt numerous contractual practices that hampered Information Resources' entry into European markets.</p>
<p>"We are confident that this undertaking will allow us, and our European partners, to offer services to European customers on the basis of inherent merit," Information Resources chairman Thomas Wilson Jr said in a statement. "This is a major win for consumer packaged goods manufacturers everywhere."</p>
<p>Information Resources said it still has a lawsuit pending in federal court for the Southern District of New York against Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp, Nielsen and IMS International, a unit of Cognizant Corp arising out of the practices which Nielsen has now undertaken to stop.</p>
<p>Information Resources provides data base product marketing information services.</p>
