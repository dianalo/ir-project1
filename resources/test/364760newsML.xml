<p>South Korean state prosecutors on Friday continued questioning three of the country's current or former bank chiefs over the Hanbo Steel loan scandal.</p>
<p>Korea Exchange Bank president Chang Myung-son, Korea Development Bank president Kim Shi-hyung and Cho Hung Bank's former president, Lee Chong-yeon, were summoned on Thursday.</p>
<p>"They are being questioned now. But I can't say whether they will be returned home without being charged," one prosecution official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The state Korean Broadcasting System radio said the three would not face any legal action and would be allowed home later on Friday, New Year's Eve in Korea.</p>
<p>State prosecutors have been investigating the financial failure of Hanbo Steel, which piled up some five trillion won ($5.8 billion) in loans from banks and financial institutions.</p>
<p>Hanbo is seeking court receivership. The nation's largest steelmaker, Pohang Iron and Steel Co, has officially accepted an invitation to help run Hanbo on behalf of creditors.</p>
<p>Chung Tae-soo, founder of the Hanbo Group of which Hanbo Steel is the flagship, and two commercial bank heads -- Sheen Kwang-shik of Korea First Bank and Woo Chan-mok of Cho Hung -- have been arrested on charges of bribery.</p>
<p>The arrests brought to 18 the total number of bankers who have been jailed or forced to resign since Kim swept to power in 1993 on an anti-graft platform.</p>
<p>Most were found to have accepted bribes from borrowers.</p>
