<p>The U.S. Supreme Court Monday granted Honeywell Inc's appeal and set aside a ruling that reinstated a jury verdict of patent infringement liability in a dispute with Litton Industries Inc.</p>
<p>The ruling by a federal appeals court called for a new trial on the amount of damages Litton should be awarded. Litton has been seeking $1.96 billion in damages from Honeywell as part of the legal battle that dates back to 1990.</p>
<p>Litton has charged that Honeywell had willfully infringed on a Litton patent for developing a laser gyroscope navigation and guidance system.</p>
<p>The high court set aside the appeals court decision and sent the case back for further consideration in view of a Supreme Court ruling earlier this month.</p>
<p>The Supreme court in that ruling upheld a key part of patent law that makes it easier for patent holders to protect their inventions from similar ideas.</p>
<p>After a lengthy trial in 1993, a federal jury awarded Litton $1.2 billion. But U.S. District Judge Mariana Pfaelzer in Los Angeles threw out the award, determining as a matter of law that Honeywell did not infringe Litton's patent.</p>
<p>But the appeals court in July reinstated the jury's verdict of patent infringement. It refused to reinstate the jury's $1.2 billion award and ordered a new trial to determine damages.</p>
<p>Honeywell appealed to the Supreme Court, saying the appeals court decision was wrong in finding patent infringement. The patent at issue in the case will expire in 1998.</p>
