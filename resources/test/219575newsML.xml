<title>UK: French wheat firms, other EU grains steady in week.</title>
<headline>French wheat firms, other EU grains steady in week.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-11-27</dateline>

<p>A local truckers' strike pushed French wheat up this week but elsewhere in Europe grain prices were generally steady amid a slow pick-up in demand.</p>
<p>Traders said the French truck drivers' strike, now on its tenth day, was starting to disrupt grain supplies to port silos.</p>
<p>Officials in the ports of Rouen, Dunkirk and Bordeaux have said road blockades and shortage of petrol were beginning to hamper operations while prompt grain supplies were needed to complete a few cargoes currently loading in Rouen.</p>
<p>Rouen-delivered soft wheat traded at 860 francs a tonne for December on Wednesday, 10 francs higher than a week ago.</p>
<p>Elsewhere prices were generally flat with the focus being the European Union's (EU) export rebate due on Thursday.</p>
<p>There will be bids to cover a recent wheat sale of 150,000 tonnes of French wheat to Egypt and traders will again test the limits of the EU's ability to challenge cheaper Argentine wheat, currently selling aggressively to North African outlets.</p>
<p>The EU said it was pricing its wheat against the U.S. product, which was bypassed again on Wednesday in imports sought by Morocco and Sri Lanka which mainly favoured Argentina.</p>
<p>Algeria is also in the market for 100,000 tonnes of optional origin wheat, which may include French, U.S. or Argentine.</p>
<p>German exporters kept their prices steady this week on prospects to sell more grain to eastern and southern Europe.</p>
<p>"We also won't reduce prices because we hope...for the EU to approve further export rebates to third countries," said one.</p>
<p>British feed wheat traded at a steady 99 stg a tonne in East Anglia for January-March but was about one stg off last week's peaks. Traders said the market was almost entirely chained to sterling's moves and physical dealings were slow.</p>
<p>"Export prospects were killed by sterling," said one.</p>
<p>Domestic millers and compounders were largely covered until after Christmas and farm selling had ground to a halt.</p>
<p>In Italy demand for durum wheat began to pick up as pasta makers prepared for a Christmas boost in sales.</p>
<p>Maize and soft wheat prices were largely unchanged from a week ago amid abundant supplies from abroad.</p>
<p>As for barley, the French market was helped up by news Saudi Arabia was working on a tender to import 500,000 tonnes of optional-origin feed barley for January delivery.</p>
<p>Potential suppliers were said to be Australia, Canada and the EU. But it remained unclear whether the EU will raise its refund to compete with Canada and Australia.</p>
<p>Barley was under pressure in the UK and Germany, where fob prices were marked down by 2.50-5.00 marks to between 250-260.</p>
<p>French maize firmed as cold and rain slowed the harvest. Spanish collection was also delayed in some regions by wet weather, but prices were lower in an otherwise steady market.</p>
<p>"Occasionally we've had batches of maize offered for around 22,600 pesetas but these are one-offs for people who can take it immediately," said a Madrid trader.  </p>
<p>Following are the latest prices of benchmark European grains. All prices are per tonne. French prices exclude carry.</p>
