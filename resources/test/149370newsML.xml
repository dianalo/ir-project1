<headline>NHL ICE HOCKEY-CANADIENS DEAL TURGEON TO BLUES FOR CORSON.</headline>
<dateline>MONTREAL 1996-10-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Two teams looking to jump-start their season pulled off a major deal Tuesday as the Montreal Canadiens dealt centre Pierre Turgeon to the St Louis Blues for left wing Shayne Corson in a five-player trade.</p>
<p>Corson, along with defenceman Murray Baron and a 1997 fifth-round draft pick were sent to Montreal for Turgeon, defenceman Rory Fitzpatrick and centre Craig Conroy. Corson and Turgeon were captains of their respective teams.</p>
<p>Turgeon is the fifth successive Montreal captain to be traded, joining Chris Chelios, Guy Carbonneau, Kirk Muller and, most recently, Mike Keane.</p>
<p>It is a curious trade from the St Louis perspective since Turgeon is a finesse player, not the kind of player Blues coach and general manager Mike Keenan usually covets.</p>
<p>But the 27-year-old Turgeon, who had one goal and a team-leading 10 assists for Montreal in nine games, is a playmaker and someone who can set up goals for right wing Brett Hull.</p>
<p>Turgeon, the number one pick in the 1987 draft by the Buffalo Sabres, led the Canadiens with 38 goals and 96 points last season. In the last three full seasons, Turgeon has at least 38 goals and 94 points.</p>
<p>Corson, 30, who is returning to Montreal, had only two goals and one assist in 11 games with the Blues. Corson had 18 goals and 28 assists in 77 games last season. He signed as a free agent before last season but was named captain of the team early on after Keenan stripped Hull of the honour.</p>
<p>Corson is making a return to Montreal, where he spent the first six-plus seasons of his career. Corson's best campaign came in 1989-90, when he tallied 31 goals and 44 assists for 75 points.</p>
<p>The dealing of the 27-year-old Baron leaves Hull as the only player that is still on the roster since Keenan took over 26 months ago in July of 1994.</p>
<p>Baron had two assists and 11 penalty minutes in 11 games. He is known primarily as a physical player who is good in his own zone and had 190 penalty minutes last season.</p>
<p>Conroy, a seventh-round pick in the 1990 draft, went scoreless in seven games last season. The 22-year-old led the Canadiens' top American Hockey League team with 10 goals and 15 points in nine games.</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick had one assist in six games for the Canadiens this season. The 21-year-old was Montreal's second-round pick in the 1993 draft.</p>
