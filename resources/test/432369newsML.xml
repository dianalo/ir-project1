<headline>U.S. corporate bond new issuance to perk up.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-03-11</dateline>
<text>
<p>After a typically slow start to the week, issuers of both high-grade and high-yield corporate debt are expected to begin pricing new deals in the U.S. market on Tuesday, market officials said.</p>
<p>Syndicate officials said issuers, drawn by relatively low interest rates and strong investor demand, are likely to sell a substantial amount of new paper on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In the investment-grade sector, American General Corp is holding a 144a private placement offering of $500 million in capital securities via competitive bid for late Tuesday morning, market sources said.  </p>
<p>The 49-year, bullet structure of the securities has been used by insurance companies before, syndicate officials said.</p>
<p>Also, Petroleum Geo-Services ASA is expected to sell $300 million in senior unsecured notes due 2007 via Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp on Tuesday, market sources said.</p>
<p>The company is a Norwegian offshore and seismological services provider.</p>
<p>In the junk-bond market, Anvil Knitwear Inc is expected to sell $130 million in 144a 10-year senior notes via DLJ, today. Price talk is around 10.75 percent, market sources said.  </p>
<p>Also on slate for Tuesday is a 144a offering of 10-year notes from Dyncorp Inc via BT Securities Corp. Price talk is between 275 to 300 basis points, market sources said.</p>
<p>Returning to high-grades, Archer Daniels Midland Co may sell $300 million of 30-year non-callable debt as early as Tuesday via Salomon Brothers Inc, syndicate sources said.</p>
<p>Northwest Airlines is also rumored to be selling $250 million in seven or 10-year notes via Goldman Sachs &amp; Co.</p>
<p>ABN-AMRO Bank is also expected to sell $250 milllion of perpetual securities, which are non-callable for 10-years, via Morgan Stanley &amp; Co Inc, market sources said.  </p>
<p>On tomorrow's agenda, Honeywell Inc is expected to sell $200 million in five-year and $200 milllion in 10-year notes via joint-lead managers Bear Stearns Co Inc and JP Morgan Securities Inc.</p>
<p>Price talk on the deal is 35 basis points over Treasuries for the five-year paper and 47 to 48 basis points over Treasuries for the 10-year paper, market sources said.</p>
<p>Market sources expect the deal to see strong demand from investors, as Honeywell, a well-known U.S. manufacturing company, is not a regular issuer in the corporate debt markets.</p>
<p>Honeywell makes automation and control systems for the home and areospace markets.</p>
