<p>Hungary's Postabank Securities started coverage of over-the-counter-market (OTC) traded electricity distributor Demasz Rt with a 'buy' rating on its profitability.</p>
<p>"Demasz Rt was the only profitable electricity distributor in 1996 and we estimate it to have the highest return on equity (ROE) in 1997," analysts Ferenc Szollosi and Tamas Hargitai said in a company report.</p>
<p>"This (estimated 5.03 percent ROE) is still below the desired eight percent, but represents a substantial improvement over the average of the past few years," they said.</p>
<p>Hungary promised an eight percent return on investment to strategic investors who bought into the sector in 1995.</p>
<p>"Comparing to other electricity distributors we established that Demasz's shares were the cheapest despite the highest return on equity," the analysts said. "As a result of (its) bourse listing we recommend the purchase of the shares."</p>
<p>Hungarian securities houses's officially published bids and offers range between 59.1 percent and 75 percent of Demasz's face value.</p>
<p>Demasz has not yet decided to seek listing of its shares but under Hungary's new securities act, which has been effective since January, electricity distributors have to seek listing no later than December 31, 1998, the analysts said.</p>
<p>France's EDF acquired a 47.98 percent stake in Demasz and has an option to raise it to 50 percent plus one share.</p>
