<p>Thousands of German soldiers and volunteers waged a desperate battle on Saturday to shore up weak spots in dikes along the Oder river that risk unleashing massive floods.</p>
<p>In the riverside village of Hohenwutzen, the Achilles' heel in the line of flood barriers on Germany's eastern border, military helicopters whirred overhead all afternoon, carrying sandbags to bolster the weakened dike.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 soldiers and thousands more aid workers, water rescue teams, volunteer firefighters and local villagers have fought for nearly two weeks to keep the dam from bursting.</p>
<p>While Germany has escaped the worst of a month of flooding that has claimed over 100 lives in Poland and the Czech Republic, damage to homes, businesses and farms is extensive.</p>
<p>Should the dike break, which officials still say is more likely than not, water would flood the Oderbruch basin, an area 17 km (11 miles) wide and 50 km (30 miles) long on Germany's border with Poland, engulfing dozens of villages, farms and factories.</p>
<p>Exhausted soldiers slept sitting up in green army buses as fresh troops were rushed in to repair cracks in the dike near Hohenwutzen, Reitwein and Zollbruecke.</p>
<p>"We are working around the clock," said army captain Michael Schierenberg amid the din of helicopters and the rumble of military transport vehicles.</p>
<p>"We no longer rest at night and there isn't a single point (in the dam) that is fully secure," he added.</p>
<p>As Schierenberg spoke a huge building crane swung out over the river's edge and placed a load of sandbags onto a barge to be pushed upstream to one of the three critical sections of dike now being constantly reinforced.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the flood crisis committee in nearby Bad Freienwalde said soldiers and aid workers had all three weak spots under control and had begun shoring up a crack in the dike further south, by Ratzdorf.</p>
<p>Other workers were busy felling trees to clear a route for the helicopters to fly in sandbags.</p>
<p>Repair work started on a second line of dikes near Zollbruecke. Private construction firms delivered tonnes of gravel to build a five metre wall as a second line of defence which officials hope will stop the flood should the main dike burst.</p>
<p>The last time a break in the dike flooded the Oderbruch region was in 1947 near Reitwein.</p>
<p>"It looks a lot worse to me than it did in 1947," said Erwin Guenzel, 66, a retired farmer in the village of Altreetz, which would be directly in the path of the flood.</p>
<p>In Zollbruecke, some people already had ladders leading up to second storey windows to climb to safety should the dam break.</p>
<p>The region lies below the level of the river, which presses against twists and turns in the dike as the Oder runs north to the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>The Oderbruch basin was created 250 years ago by Frederick the Great of Prussia by draining swamps and redirecting the route of the Oder, gaining a huge valley of arable land.</p>
<p>Weeks of flooding and relentless rainstorms seem to be driving the river to seek its original banks, now covered by fields of grain, sunflowers and sugar beet.</p>
<p>Around 15,000 people have been evacuated from the region since last week and thousands more warned to be ready to leave their homes at a moment's notice.</p>
