<p>-- Credit Lyonnais said it has started coverage of Chilean brewer Compania Cervecerias Unidas SA with a rating of hold.</p>
<p>-- "We expect a secondary ADR (American Depositary Receipt) issue to raise $175-$200 million which will be used to restructure debt obligations and invest in new capacity and marketing through the company's operations," analyst James Trowbridge wrote in a report.</p>
<p>-- He added, "The company's effort to gain share in new markets while maintaining its share core markets is pressuring margins.</p>
<p>-- "With the dilutive effects of the forthcoming capital increase, we do not forecast significant earnings growth in the next two years."</p>
<p>-- Trowbridge set a 12-month price target of $22 an ADR.</p>
<p>-- The company's ADR was down 1/4 to 19-5/8 on Monday in New York.</p>
<p>-- Ian Simpson, Wall Street desk, (212) 859-1879</p>
