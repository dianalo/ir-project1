<p>---------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The Key March Euroyen futures contract on TIFFE was a tad easier at the close of Thursday's day session, due to some technical selling by traders.</p>
<p>The key overnight call rate eased in late trade. This was despite the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) less accommodative credit stance for the third consecutive day.</p>
<p>The BOJ left the money market with a shortfall of some 90 billion yen after its regular market operation at 0020 GMT.  </p>
<p>The central bank has been leaving the market with a shortfall of approximately 100 billion yen since Tuesday, after the call rate dropped sharply to 0.39 percent on Monday.</p>
<p>The call rate rose to 0.48 percent in early trade with traders paying heed to the BOJ's operational stance.</p>
<p>But, it eased to 0.43 percent in late trade. The weighted average of the call rate was 0.45 percent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The BOJ, via its persistently parsimonious fund supply, has been trying to warn against what it sees as "excessive market speculation" that interest rates will stay low in the coming several months, traders said.  </p>
<p>Friday is the final day of the one-month bank reporting period of which banks are required to deposit a certain amount of their reserves with the BOJ.</p>
<p>The fall in the call rate partly reflected banks' intention to push down the rate ahead of Friday when they have to raise some funds to meet the reserve requirement, traders said.</p>
<p>In the long end of the money market, key three month certificates of deposit were traded at 0.53 percent, unchanged since September 3.</p>
