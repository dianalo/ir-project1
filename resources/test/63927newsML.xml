<p>Hungary's state privatisation agency APV Rt will announce an open tender for the sale of cab company Fotaxi Rt, APV's spokesman said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The potential buyer will have to bid for a 90 percent stake while the remaining 10 percent will be set aside for employees, Adam Dudits told APV's weekly news conference.</p>
<p>In case employees' package is undersubscribed the buyer will have to purchase the remaining stake, he said.</p>
<p>In 1995 Fotaxi was in red with 231 million forints of losses on total net sales of one billion forints.</p>
<p>Last year Fotaxi had an average of 1,374 cars for transport of persons and goods and wishes to buy 100 new ones this year, with 50 Opels and 50 Fiats among them.</p>
<p>Fotaxi has a 13.2 percent stake on the Budapest taxi market, he said. -- Budapest newsroom (36 1) 327-4040</p>
