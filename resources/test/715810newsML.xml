<p>Kenyan authorities on Wednesday closed the University of Nairobi after students marched into the city centre following a call for more protests by opposition groups demanding constitutional reforms.</p>
<p>A statement by the university Vice-Chancellor, Francis Gichaga, said the closure was necessitated by the deteriorating situation on the main campus as political tension rose in the east African country.</p>
<p>"Despite the appeal for calm in the circular of 8th July and the address by the vice-chancellor, the situation has continued to deteroriate...the Univertsity of Nairobi (UoN) will be closed with immediate effect," Gichaga said in a statement.</p>
<p>The University of Nairobi hosts 19,000 students. Its closure had been widely expected since last weekend when political unrest broke out in Kenya.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 students chanting "No Going Home" resisted the closure of the university and demanded an address by the vice chancellor. Riot and the elite paramilitary General Service Unit (GSU) police stood guard around the main university campus in the heart of the capital.</p>
<p>Heavily armed police and GSU units also patrolled the streets of Nairobi and more reinforcements were being moved into the city centre.</p>
<p>Earlier on Wednesday, students took to the streets to protest reports that four colleagues had died of wounds in clashes with police during protests on Monday.</p>
<p>Police spokesman Assistant Commissioner Peter Kimanthi denied the report in the independent Daily Nation newspaper describing it as "pure falsehood".</p>
<p>Kimanthi told Reuters in a telephone interview that only two students died in incidents completely unrelated to the protests on Monday.</p>
<p>He said one student died at the city's Kenyatta National Hospital in circumstances still unknown while another was knocked down by a hit-and-run lorry. Kimanthi said police were probing both incidents.</p>
<p>"The police wish to clarify media reports on the deaths. The position is that one student died yesterday (Tuesday) at Kenyatta hospital. We do not know what caused his death but we are investigating," Kimanthi said.</p>
<p>He added: "Another student was knocked down by a hit-and-run lorry. It was a road accident and we are also investigating the accident. Both incidents are totally unrelated to the protests on Monday."</p>
<p>Nine people were killed in Kenya on Monday during the most violent clashes between police and protesters since unrest in 1991 that helped push Moi to allow multi-party elections.</p>
<p>Opposition parties, human rights groups and other bodies under the umbrella National Convention Executive Committee (NCE) have called for protests on Wednesday to press the government for constitutional reforms before elections.</p>
<p>Reformists want the repeal of six laws that date from colonial times including the Public Order Act used to regulate public gatherings. They are also demanding free access to state-controlled media, particularly radio, and changes in the electoral law.</p>
<p>The students blocked the main highway through the Kenyan capital at the height of the morning rush hour. Riot police and elite paramilitary General Service Unit (GSU) personnel moved in to confront the students.</p>
<p>Witnesses at the main university campus said there was a standoff between yelling students and police units. A student leader told Reuters that the students had asked police for a permit to demonstrate peacefully and the request was being considered.</p>
<p>No date has been set for the parliamentary and presidential polls in which Moi, 73, is still widely expected to win another five-year term because of squabbling among oppositon leaders.</p>
