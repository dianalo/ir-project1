<p>United Parcel Service said Thursday it will start flying passengers on its huge fleet of cargo jets on weekends, a slack time for its package-shipping business.</p>
<p>But don't rush to book a flight at your neighbourhood UPS shipping agent.</p>
<p>UPS, which bills itself as the world's largest package distributor, will take its first weekend charter passengers from Pittsburgh to Orlando next month, UPS spokesman Ken Shapero said. An exact starting date has not been set.</p>
<p>"People don't get to call UPS and book a seat," Shapero said. "We'll be booking charter tours through travel agencies."</p>
<p>Shapero said initially five of the 197 distinctively brown UPS jets will be made over each Friday. Window covers will come off and seats and emergency oxygen will be added.</p>
<p>"You won't be sitting on pallets or crates," he said.</p>
<p>UPS pilots will fly the planes and contract employees will serve as flight attendants. Each Monday, the jets will be reconverted for hauling cargo.</p>
<p>UPS intends to offer the passenger services only in North America. But if charter companies show an interest, the company may expand the new service overseas, Shapero said.</p>
