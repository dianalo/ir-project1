<p>Dutch giant Philips Electronics NV on Friday signalled its clear intent to shed small underperforming businesses, freeing up resources to grow its core activities.</p>
<p>In a brief statement, Philips said its Industrial Electronics (IE) division would sell nine small operating companies this year, adding to a string of minor sell-offs by the group in recent months.</p>
<p>"Philips (IE)...announced its intention to further stimulate growth in several of its operating companies," the group said.</p>
<p>"This decision, which will allow the division to focus on and strengthen its key businesses, will also lead to nine smaller operating companies being sold."</p>
<p>It said the companies concerned employ around 1,500 staff and made up around 15 percent of total IE sales, which amounted to over three billion guilders in 1996.</p>
<p>The firms to be sold off are: Philips Power Systems of Wavre, Belgium; Thermocoax of Suresnes, France; Philips TV Test Equipment of Brondby, Denmark; Philips Weighing and Philips Electronic Center of Hamburg, Germany; Philips Industrial Automation Systems of Eindhoven and PBF of Almelo in the Netherlands; Philips Kistaindustrier AB of Kista, Sweden and Edax International of Mahwah, New Jersey in the United States.</p>
<p>Philips' IE division will now focus on several clusters of activities, such as analytical equipment, communication and security products and systems, electronic production equipment and industrial and infrastructure projects, it said.</p>
<p>The group, which slumped back into a loss in 1996, said on February 25 it was selling a 50 percent stake in cable television operator United and Philips Communications BV (UPC), a joint-venture with United International Holdings Inc.</p>
<p>Philips has not yet given a clear indication of what it plans to do with the proceeds of a string of disposals announced or completed since last October when new chairman Cor Boonstra vowed to tackle underperforming "bleeders".</p>
<p>Philips has embarked on a stringent restructuring to weed out non-core businesses and tighten management as a way of boosting profits, winding up or selling off units such as its Videoland and Superclub home entertainment businesses.</p>
<p>Another "bleeder", heavy loss-making German consumer electronics unit Grundig [GRNG.CN] was pushed out to arm's length in January when Philips said it would no longer pick up the tab for 100 percent of its losses, instead consolidating the firm in proportion to its 32 percent minority shareholding.</p>
<p>Analysts have welcomed the moves as emphasising that Boonstra meant business in sorting out the company's weak spots and putting Philips back on track towards profit.</p>
<p>In Amsterdam, Philips shares closed 1.40 guilders higher at 83.50 guilders each.</p>
