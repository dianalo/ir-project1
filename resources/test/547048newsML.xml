<p>House Speaker Newt Gingrich said Tuesday President Clinton needs about 90 Democrats to back trade negotiation legislation in order to get it through the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The so-called fast-track trade negotiation authority is needed for U.S. officials to negotiate an expansion of the North American Free Trade Agreement to include Chile and other market opening trade agreements.</p>
<p>"We'd move fast-track the minute the administration can help us find some Democratic votes and can agree on language," Gingrich told reporters after testifying at a House Ways and Means trade subcommittee hearing.</p>
<p>"The President needs to bring about 90 votes with him," Gingrich said. "I think we could almost certainly carry fast-track if he gave us the 90 votes."</p>
<p>Administration officials have said they have been consulting with members of Congress to draft fast-track legislation that could win both Democratic and Republican support. U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky said it was too early to assess how much bipartisan support there was for the legislation.</p>
<p>"I don't want to make any comments on possible vote counts. I don't think either the administration or the members of Congress are in any particular position to count votes at this point," Barshefsky told reporters.</p>
<p>Fast-track would give the president authority to negotiate a trade agreement without fear that Congress would change it. Congress would have to vote either for or against the proposed agreement without amendment.</p>
<p>Republicans and Democrats are split over labour and environment issues. Republicans, who control Congress, do not want those issues to be included in trade negotiations.</p>
<p>Many Democrats, including the two ranking members of the House -- Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Minority Whip David Bonior -- oppose fast-track authority that does not specifically include authority to negotiate on those issues.</p>
