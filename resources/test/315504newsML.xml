<p>The Finnish markka's current foreign exchange levels and current Finnish interest rates reflect the country's economic situation and outlook, Bank of Finland board member Matti Vanhala said on Friday.</p>
<p>"The rate and interest rates are in accordance with the economic situation and the outlook," he told Reuters by telephone in response to recent upward pressures on the markka.</p>
<p>Vanhala confirmed these had led to central bank intervention, which he said accounted for much of a 15.7 billion markka increase in the bank's foreign currency reserves in the week to January 15.</p>
<p>Asked to comment on recent demand for the markka, Vanhala said: "Some operators have painted a too rosy picture of the Finnish economy".</p>
<p>"Some may not have expected the Bank of Finland to raise its reserves as we did," he said. "We were actually quite happy to do so," he said. "They were unnecessarily low."</p>
<p>Vanhala said the economy is developing well, but that Finland still needs to run strong current account surpluses due to its high foreing debt, and that the Bank's analysis of the outlook was in line with domestic economists' forecasts.</p>
<p>"We have more or less the same view of the future," he said.</p>
<p>Vanhala said the central banks' intervention had always taken place at market rates and that the bank had absorbed the extra markka inflow back into its balance sheet.</p>
<p>He said the intervention corresponded to most of the superflous demand based on unfouded analysis.</p>
