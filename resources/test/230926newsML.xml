<headline>Argentine bonds rise, client demand expected.</headline>
<dateline>BUENOS AIRES 1996-12-03</dateline>
<text>
<p>Argentine bonds finished higher on Tuesday, driven by traders in anticipation of future client demand.</p>
<p>"There is a bullish mood at the moment," said a portfolio manager at a large Argentine bank. "Traders expect the client demand to come."</p>
<p>The dollar-denominated Bocon Previsional 2 due 2001 rose 0.30 to 122.30, while Argentina's FRB due 2005 advanced 3/8 to 87. However, traders reported very thin activity again, with still no signs of any pick-up in turnover imminent.  </p>
<p>A trader said the market is "very solid" particularly thanks to the boost from the firm U.S. Treasury bond market. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond last stood at 6.35 percent.</p>
<p>The portfolio manager said, however, he thought the market had risen too much recently and foreign clients would probably not be attracted at these price levels.</p>
<p>"I think the market is too expensive," he said.</p>
<p>In the money markets, call money rates fell to 6.75 percent from 6.85 percent.</p>
