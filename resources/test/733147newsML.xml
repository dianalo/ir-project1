<p>Hilton Hotels Corp Chief Executive Stephen Bollenbach, in a sharply worded statement, called ITT Corp's plan to split into three companies a "smoke-and-mirrors scheme."</p>
<p>Hilton bid $55 a share for ITT in January, ITT rejected the bid as inadequate, and since then the companies have been locked in a multibillioon-dollar battle for control of ITT.</p>
<p>"If ITT wanted to create shareholder value, they should be and should have been talking to Hilton," Bollenbach said. "This recent ITT move reflects a value-destructive 'anybody-but-Hilton' attitude."  </p>
<p>He continued, "A Hilton/ITT combination would bring more value to ITT shareholders than any 'smoke-and-mirrors' scheme, ITT, when faced with a ready, willing and able buyer, still takes an action that denies its shareholders the right to decide the future of their company."</p>
<p>ITT today announced plans to split in three: ITT Destinations Inc would focus on Sheraton Hotels and Caesars casinos; ITT Corp would own the publisher of telephone directories and other information; ITT Educational Services Inc would provide post-secondary technical education.  </p>
<p>In addition to the break-up, ITT said it would spend $2.1 billion to buy back 30 million of its common shares, or about 26 percent of the total outstanding, at $70 per share.</p>
<p>ITT also plans to buy back $2.0 billion of existing debt through a tender offer later this year.</p>
