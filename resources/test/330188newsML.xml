<p>Chechnya security officials said on Friday they were taking special measures to ensure that Monday's presidential and parliamentary election is not marred by violence.</p>
<p>Police patrols have been put on alert and each of the approximately 90 international observers monitoring the vote will be accompanied by armed guards, interior minister Kazbek Makhashev told journalists.</p>
<p>"From today (Friday) interior ministry personnel have been put on heightened alert," Makhashev told reporters in Grozny, renamed Dzhokhar-Ghala on Thursday to honour former rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, who died in a Russian rocket attack.</p>
<p>But Makhashev admitted there was to way to rule out problems. "It is difficult to exclude provocations by forces who want to destabilise the situation in the republic," he said.</p>
<p>Russia sent troops into tiny Moslem Chechnya in 1994 to crush its independence drive but pulled them out less than two years later after humiliating defeats, leaving the oil-rich region with its de facto sovereignty intact.</p>
<p>There are 16 candidates in Monday's poll for the presidency and last-ditch efforts to find a common position and unite round one candidate failed on Friday.</p>
<p>"There is now absolutely no chance of a common candidate," Mayerbek Vachagayev, top aide to front-runner and former rebel chief commander Aslan Maskhadov, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Vachagayev said acting president Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev had suggested fielding a common candidate only because he had little chance of winning and not from a desire to preserve unity.</p>
<p>He said the results of Maskhadov's camp's latest poll showed 62 percent of voters were likely to support Maskhadov. He said the survey was conducted over the last three days among several hundred voters in Grozny and in rural areas.</p>
<p>He said Yandarbiyev, former field commander Shamil Basayev and wartime propoganda chief Movladi Udugov were trailing badly with between 11 and 15 percent of the vote each.</p>
<p>A Reuter straw poll of 150 likely Grozny voters taken Wednesday and Thursday gave Maskhadov about 57 percent.</p>
<p>Many Chechens admit they are dismayed at how the campaign has smashed unity won in their 21-month war with Russian troops and Chechen elders had suggested seeking a single candidate.</p>
<p>But all candidates share a desire for an independent Chechnya and most say Russia is trying to sabotage the vote by provoking crimes against civilians, objecting to voting rules for refugees, and talking of giving arms to people in some Russian areas bordering Chechnya.</p>
<p>They have accused Russian intelligence services of being behind the brutal murders of six foreign Red Cross workers in the town of Noviye Atagi last month.</p>
<p>International aid workers pulled out of Chechnya after the killings.</p>
<p>The Chechens say all this will be used by Moscow to claim, after the poll, that the vote was illegitimate.</p>
<p>Russia, for its part, accuses Chechnya of shifting blame to cover up what it says is Chechen inability to control crime and violence on its own soil.</p>
<p>Maskhadov, seen as the most moderate candidate, would need to clear a fifty percent barrier to avoid a runoff with the second-place vote-getter in two weeks.</p>
<p>Polling stations open at 7 a.m. (0400 GMT) and close at 8 p.m. (1700 GMT).</p>
<p>The Central Elections Commission puts the registered electorate at approximately 400,000, but the figure does not include refugees who will vote in special stations or persons who returned to the republic recently.</p>
