<p>Development of market for futures and derivatives in India may be a year away, the president of BA Futures Inc said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I think in about a year's time," Gregg H. Byers, president of the Chicago-based Bank of America subsidiary told Reuters in reply to a question on how soon he expected to see a local market emerging.</p>
<p>India's National Stock Exchange (NSE) has developed excellent software to monitor customer exposures, he said.</p>
<p>"It is quite impressive. If that could be applied to futures trading, it would give confidence," Byers said.</p>
<p>"The technical expertise here is good. The NSE can develop (a futures trading programme) before someone else does," he said.</p>
<p>Byers heads a BA Futures team holding a training seminar on futures and derivatives for Indian treasury managers.</p>
<p>Officials of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) participated in the programme.</p>
<p>Byers said he expected stock index futures to come up first, possibly followed by treasury bill-based instruments.  </p>
<p>"The RBI has allowed Indian corporates and institutions to freely hedge their exchange rate risks using certain specified derivative instruments," said Tej Mohan Chhabra, assistant vice president (foreign exchange) Bank of America in Bombay.</p>
<p>"Bank of America has been an active participant in this market and it has been our endeavour to share our global expertise in this area with our clients," he said.</p>
