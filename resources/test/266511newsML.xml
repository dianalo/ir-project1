<p>The Bank of Canada said on Thursday it is considering changing the rules governing federal debt auctions in Canada to prevent manipulation and maintain investor confidence.</p>
<p>The new rules under consideration were included in a discussion paper released on Thursday which asks market participants for their views on the changes.</p>
<p>The central bank said the new rules are designed to avert so-called squeezes, which take place when just one or a few investors buy up an entire bond or T-bill issue. These investors then hike the price for resale to other investors who need to own the issue.</p>
<p>"It is very important that the confidence of direct participants and end-investors in the auction process be sustained. Auctions should be free of, and be perceived as being free of, manipulation," the bank said in the paper.</p>
<p>Under the new rules dealers and customers bidding at auctions would have to dislose their holdings of the debt issues being bid for. Bidding limits would also be put in place for customers buying through dealers. Penalties would be imposed on those who break the new rules.</p>
<p>The central bank also said it would step up its surveillance of bond and T-bill auctions.</p>
<p>Analysts said the push for new regulation is being prompted by a variety of factors, including a decline in the federal government's borrowing requirements.</p>
<p>Canada's budget deficit has shrunk since Finance Minister Paul Martin took office and it is expected to decline further in coming years. As a result the amount of debt being auctioned will also shrink, increasing the likelihood that entire issues may be bought up by one or just a few market participants.</p>
<p>The growing size and influence of many market players, as well as the consolidation of the major banks and investment dealers also increase the need for the new regulations, the central bank said.</p>
<p>"These things taken together point to a need to clarify and strengthen the rules. This has not just come up out of nowhere. It's been under discussion for some time," said a Department of Finance official.</p>
<p>The official noted there has also been an increase in anecdotal reports of squeezes, particularly with T-bills, which mature in one year or less.</p>
<p>The Canadian government has reduced the size of its T-bill tenders over the past several months and has shifted more of its borrowing into the less volatile bond markets.</p>
<p>"The T-bill sector is the area in which we've experienced the most frequently reported problems, although it has also been in the bond market," the official said.</p>
<p>The Bank of Canada is asking market participants for comments on the proposed rules by March 31, 1997. More discussion papers are expected in the new year, and new regulations would likely be put in place by this time next year, the official said.</p>
