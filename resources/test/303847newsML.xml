<text>
<p>Growth Fund of Spain Inc said about 1.7 million shares may still be repurchased under a previously announced authorization to buy back up to two million shares, Zurich Kemper Investments, its advisor, said.</p>
<p>This repurchase authorization is in addition to the one million share repurchase authorization completed June 25, 1996.</p>
<p>Repurchases will only be made when the fund's shares are trading at less than net asset value and at times and amounts that are believed to be in the best interest of fund shareholders.</p>
<p>Based on the January 7 closing price of $13.000, the fund's shares are trading at a 17.98 percent discount to net asset value.</p>
<p>Growth Fund of Spain is one of seven closed-end funds managed by Zurich Kemper Investments, which is part of Zurich Insurance Co.</p>
