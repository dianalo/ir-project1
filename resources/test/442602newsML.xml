<p>Cotton merchant William B. Dunavant Jr. said if polyester prices remain low, it could stop cotton from increasing its market share.</p>
<p>"One of my major concerns as I look at the future -- and one that I really haven't been paying attention to but I'm really focusing in on now -- is what's happening in the manmade fiber industry with polyester prices," Dunavant said in a speech to Rabobank International's World Cotton Conference here.</p>
<p>Polyester prices now ranged from 50 to 65 cents per lb, he said.</p>
<p>"Those prices, in my opinion, if they continue in that lower area, are going to keep cotton from enhancing its market share," he said.</p>
<p>He projected that cotton's world market share would decline to 45 percent by the year 2000 from 45.6 percent now.</p>
<p>"If you're looking at 60 cents for manmade fiber prices and 80 cents for cotton prices delivered to mill, that 20 cent gap is going to hurt cotton not only in the U.S. but around the world to some small extent," he said.</p>
