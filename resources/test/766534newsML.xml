<p>The American Gas Association Wednesday named David Parker as president, replacing Michael Baly, who quit last April.</p>
<p>Parker, who was approved unanimously by the AGA board, comes from the Aluminum Association, where he has been president since 1989, an AGA spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>He earlier worked for the Edison Electric Institute, which represents investor-owned utilities.</p>
<p>AGA, with a $29 million annual budget, represents about 250 natural gas distribution companies which account for more than 90 percent of local natural gas deliveries.</p>
