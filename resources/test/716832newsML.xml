<p>Ten-year bond futures settled higher but then retraced in after-hours trade on jitters about France's ability to qualify for European monetary union, dealers said.</p>
<p>The September bond future hit a new contract peak of 130.88 during the session before retreating to finish 0.36 higher at 130.74.</p>
<p>Dealers said the market was driven by Bunds, which also set a new contract high, and strong liquidity stemming from the maturing of the so-called Balladur bond on July 16, among other factors.  </p>
<p>The bond future then came under pressure, slipping to 130.64 on GLOBEX, following a report quoting an unidentified senior French source as saying he was more pessimistic than several months ago about France taking part in monetary union.</p>
<p>PIBOR finished two basis points lower at 96.58 on the back of a franc which weakened nearly a third of a centime against the mark to trade at 3.3767 late in the day.</p>
<p>Analysts said there was no specific reason for the franc's softness. "Volumes are really low, the smallest rumour provokes a movement," said one trader.  </p>
<p>"There's a bit of worry about monetary union being delayed," the trader said. "But there's no clear reason."</p>
<p>He said the franc's weakness was against a background of consolidation by the mark against other currencies under way for several days. But he said mark-franc volatility was still low.</p>
<p>Analysts said a household survey by national statistics institute INSEE suggesting a sharp upturn in consumer confidence also supported the market earlier in the day.</p>
<p>INSEE's overall consumer confidence indicator jumped to minus 23 in June after the Socialists were elected from minus 33 in May, one analyst said.  </p>
<p>INSEE economist Alain Chappert said it was "good information but it must not be overweighted. It's usual to have an improvement after an election."</p>
<p>The upturn was more marked than after previous elections but private economists said it was too early to conclude that a turnaround in confidence was taking place.</p>
<p>"We have seen this before. After elections, people tend to believe things will be all right and that unemployment will be attacked and then we have seen confidence fall again," said economist Philippe Brossard of ABN-Amro Finance.  </p>
<p>Economists suggested the findings could be a reflection of the Socialists' election campaign platform, which promised a war on unemployment. The confidence indicator stood at its highest level in June since the minus 21 it reached in August 1995. That was soon after Jacques Chirac was elected president -- also on a pledge to bring down unemployment.</p>
<p>Analysts said that they expected liquidity from the Balladur bond to continue underpinning the market.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the market was watching for Thursday's U.S. weekly jobless figures and Friday's U.S. inflation data.</p>
