<p>The Swiss-run International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Thursday it was axing some 100 jobs at its Geneva headquarters.</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Doris Pfister said the cuts were to reduce costs and were part of a restructuring to help the agency concentrate more on field work.</p>
<p>The reduction of the ICRC's Geneva workforce by almost one-sixth will be the first sizeable job cut ever made by the agency, which helps victims of conflicts around the world.</p>
<p>The cuts will be carried out gradually over the next few years. The ICRC has 670 employees in Geneva and another 900 in the field.</p>
<p>The ICRC had a deficit of 20 million Swiss francs ($13 million) in 1996. Its biggest contributor is the United States which covers some 20 percent of its annual budget.</p>
<p>The agency lost six Western employees in Chechnya and three in Burundi in terrorist attacks in 1996, the highest number of such deaths in its 133-year history.</p>
