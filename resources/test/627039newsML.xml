<p>Brazilian telephone holding Telebras SA rose Friday in heavy volume, highlighting trade in American Depositary Receipts (ADRs).</p>
<p>Telebras at midday was up 3-3/8 to 138-3/4, easing from a 12-month intraday high of 139-3/4.  Volume was 2.5 million shares, putting Telebras among the most active companies on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Traders said Telebras was spurred by rumors about long-distance revenues paid it by Brazil's regional telephone companies.  </p>
<p>"It's another strong day for Telebras, despite what's going on with the U.S.," a trader said.  Wall Street was dragged lower by technology stocks after chip maker Intel Corp said second-quarter results would be below expectations.</p>
<p>European shares were generally lower.  They were hit by the Intel-led selloff in New York and worries arising from Sunday's French elections, in which the left wing is confident it can win parliament.  </p>
<p>"The European ADRs as a rule are lower on jitters ahead of the French elections," said Val Kosmider, head of international equity trading at Schroder Wertheim.</p>
<p>Telefonica de Espana fell 1-5/8 to 86-1/8 on heavy volume.</p>
<p>The Netherlands' Philips Electronics NV was off 1-1/2 at 55-5/8 and Finnish telecommunications equipment maker Nokia Group fell 1-1/2 to 66-1/8.  </p>
<p>Decliners led advancers 295 to 170 among 814 ADRs. The ADR group was off 0.49 percent and volume was 53.5 million ADRs.</p>
<p>ADRs allow U.S. trading of foreign shares.</p>
