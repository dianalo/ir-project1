<p>Supervisors at Chilean state copper company Codelco's Chuquicamata pit are likely to accept the firm's pay offer in a vote next week and not go on strike, said a source close to the collective talks.</p>
<p>"The signals from the company are good. A strike is unlikely but there's always the danger something could change in coming days," the source told Reuters.</p>
<p>Talks are concentrating on several points including health benefits and bonuses, he said.</p>
<p>Codelco is due to make its final offer Monday and around 700 supervisors will vote on the deal Tuesday.</p>
<p>Chuquicamata's 7,000 miners went on strike for 10 days last year after scheduled wage talks broke down.</p>
<p>The mine, the largest of Codelco's four mining divisions, produced 632,000 tonnes of fine copper last year.</p>
