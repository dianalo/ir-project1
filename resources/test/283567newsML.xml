<p>"You may find one or two sellers who are willing to be flexible with their prices, but the buyers are not there," said another.</p>
<p>The opening rally in Chicago soy oil futures had no impact in Europe with soft oils closing unchanged from midday.</p>
<p>Dutch soy oil was unchanged to 0.50 guilders down with rape oil unchanged across the board.</p>
<p>Based on sellers' prices rape oil's permium over soy oil was three to four guilders at the close against three to 3.50 guilders on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Palm oil finished a dull session with sellers $2.50 down across the market with no futher business reported.</p>
<p>In the lauric oil sector one lone trade was reported for Jan/Feb coconut oil at $770 a tonne cif.</p>
<p>Closing coconut oil sellers were $5 to $15 down while palmkernel oil was unchanged to $15 up.</p>
