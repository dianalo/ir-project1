<p>Although Czech analysts view the major confectioner Cokoladovny a.s. as a healthy firm with expansion potential on east European markets, they say its shares are overvalued at 4,280 crowns.</p>
<p>"Through marked growth in the volume of sales and profit the stock is, in fundamental analysis, overvalued by about 15 to 20 percent," said Petr Zoufaly of the Brno-based Atlantik Financial Markets. "To us the valuation is about 3,500 crowns."</p>
<p>Cokoladovny shares closed on Tuesday 19 crowns lower at 4,280 on the Prague Stock Exchange, still well above its 12-month low at 2,820. The fairly illiquid shares traded as high as a 12-month record 4,520 last month in thin volume.</p>
<p>Nine-month 1996 gross profit of the sweets maker, based in Modrany south of Prague, rose to 910 million crowns from 677 million in the first three quarters of 1995. Analysts expect gross earnings growth of 20-40 percent for the calendar year.</p>
<p>"For (full year) 1996 we are expecting net profit of 630 million to 660 million crowns," said Tomas Navratil of AKRO Capital, which would be up from a net 516 million in 1995.</p>
<p>Most expect the company to raise its dividend on 1996 profits from the 50 crowns per share paid on 1995 earnings.</p>
<p>"We expect that dividends will be paid... something amounting to 64 crowns per share, pre-tax," said Daniel Martinu of Expandia Finance.</p>
<p>Cokoladovny is the largest foods producer in the Czech Republic, majority owned by a consortium of Swiss Nestle SA and France's Danone SA, which controls 83 percent of the company's shares according to a recent report of the Central Securities Registry.</p>
<p>Beyond the Czech and Slovak republics, it has geared its sales toward Poland, Hungary, Russia, and the Baltics.</p>
<p>"In 1996, it was able to increase its share of exports (excluding Slovakia) out of overall turnover to 15 percent from eight percent," said AKRO's Navratil.</p>
<p>But the analysts said the Swiss-French consortium's move to buy up Cokoladovny shares has thinned already-low liquidity.</p>
<p>"In the continuing purchase of shares on the market, the (majority shareholder) has reduced potential future liquidity," said Petr Dousa of Zivnostenska Banka.</p>
<p>But the shares have outperformed the PSE's PX50 index by eight percent in the past six months. Analysts think that 3,700 crowns is the ceiling for buying the stock.</p>
<p>"Although the company is fundamentally healthy, we believe, that the recent increases in the price of shares is based on technical factors, above all on strong demand for Czech blue chips in recent months," said Eric Volkman of Raiffeisen Capital &amp; Investment.</p>
