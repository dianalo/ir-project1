<headline>Banks, U.S. data boost Norwegian shares.</headline>
<dateline>OSLO 1997-04-29</dateline>
<text>
<p>Norwegian shares took a step upwards after a flat early session, boosted by fresh U.S. economic data, which showed reduced inflationary pressures.</p>
<p>Oslo's Total share index advanced 0.95 percent to end at 1,092.73 points in turnover of 1.28 billion crowns.</p>
<p>Focus was largely on the financial sector with Christiania Bank og Kreditkasse, Den norske Bank (DnB), Union Bank of Norway (UBN) and insurer Storebrand all releasing first quarter results.</p>
<p>The banking index was the highest climber on the bourse, gaining 1.28 percent to 116.55 points.  </p>
<p>A large off-floor trade of 12.5 million shares in Christiania made Norway's second largest bank the most traded share in value-terms at 386 million crowns.</p>
<p>Christiania booked first quarter operating profit before loan losses up 19 percent at 592 million crowns. It was the second best such figure in the bank's history thanks partly to it's non-interest income soaring 35 percent to 511 million.</p>
<p>Christiania ended three percent up at 24.20 crowns.</p>
<p>DnB also registered a healthy two percent rise to 26 crowns in 74.4 million crowns of trade after it said its net result rose 54 million crowns to 820 million crowns from a year ago.</p>
