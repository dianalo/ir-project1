<headline>CBOT corn closes lower on Sparks estimate, soy.</headline>

<p>A bearish crop estimate from the CEO of Memphis-based analytical firm Sparks Companies and a sharp drop in soybeans pressed CBOT corn futures to a lower close, traders said.</p>
<p>"With guys like Brunthave coming out with a crop like that the burden of proof is on the bull," said Steve Bruce of E.D. and F. Man International.</p>
<p>Sparks Companies CEO Carrol Brunthaver Monday told a National Grain and Feed Association conference in Kansas City the 1996 U.S. corn crop would total 9.3 to 9.4 billion bushels, above USDA's November forecast for 9.265 billion.</p>
<p>But the nearby December contract gained on spreads with other months on slow farmer selling and no deliveries on that month plus better-than-expected exports.</p>
<p>"Exports were bad for everything but corn," a trader said.</p>
<p>USDA's weekly export inspections report showed U.S. corn inspections for the week ended December 5 at 49.598 million bushels, above trade expectations for 45.0 to 48.0 million bushels.</p>
<p>Corn closed 1/2 to 3-1/2 cents per bushel lower, with December down 1/2 at $2.66-3/4. March was down 1-1/2 at $2.64-1/2.</p>
