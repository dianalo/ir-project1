<p>Boeing Co is considering raising production rates beyond the record 40 jets a month already planned for the fourth quarter, a company spokeswoman said Monday.</p>
<p>Barbara Murphy of Boeing's commercial airplane group declined to comment on specific figures, including a report that the company is preparing to boost production 10 percent beyond the level of 40 a month.</p>
<p>The report in the Wall Street Journal boosted Boeing stock, which was up 2-5/8 to 100-5/8 in New York Stock Exchange trading.  </p>
<p>As airline orders have poured in, Boeing already has ramped up production rates several times over the past year to a current level of 29 a month, compared with the historical peak of 39.5 a month in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Murphy said there was "room for growth" in production of the wide-body 747 and 767 models, currently each being built at a rate of four a month.  And she said Boeing actively was considering ways to increase production of the best-selling 737 model beyond the 21 jets a month scheduled for the fourth quarter, up from 12 currently.  </p>
<p>"We are considering a number of possibilities and certainly increasing the 737 production rate is one of those," Murphy said. "The market has really shown great interest in the current 737 as well as the new model."</p>
<p>Analyst Nick Heymann said he did not expect Boeing production to much exceed 40 a month unless the manufacturer won more major "sweep" contracts, such as deals it has lined up with Delta Air Lines Inc and AMR Corp.</p>
<p>He cited Continental Airlines Inc and Scandinavian Airlines System as possibilies among major airlines looking to upgrade their fleets.  </p>
<p>The newspaper quoted Boeing commercial airplane group President Ron Woodard as saying the company is studying the possibility of building up to 31 of the narrow-body 737s a month, which he described as an absolute maximum.</p>
<p>Industry analysts said they were skeptical production of the model would go that high in the current cycle but said they expected Boeing to exceed the level of 21 a month, which represents the historical peak.</p>
<p>Peter Jacobs, an analyst at Ragen MacKenzie, said he expected Boeing to raise production of the 737s to about 25 a month by sometime next year and sustain that rate for all of 1999.</p>
<p>He said Boeing would need to raise production of the 737 to higher levels only if it saw "overwhelming demand," which he considered unlikely given the competitive narrow-body models from Europe's Airbus Industrie.</p>
