<p>Corn and soybean crops improved slightly from the previous week but as the growing season approaches completion, little improvement can be expected, the Agricultural Statistics Service said on Monday.</p>
<p>An early frost would likely cause some damage to significant amounts of the corn and soybean crops.</p>
<p>Corn was rated four percent very poor, 14 percent poor, 39 percent fair, 38 good and five percent excellent.</p>
<p>Soybeans were rated three percent very poor, 16 percent poor, 40 fair, 36 percent good and five percent excellent.</p>
<p>Two percent of the corn crop was harvested, compared with three percent a year ago and five percent for the five-year average.</p>
<p>Only seven percent of the corn crop has matured, compared with 41 percent a year ago and 39 percent for the average.</p>
<p>The corn crop had reached the dent stage or beyond on 65 percent of the crop, compared with the five-year average of 96 percent.  </p>
<p>A few soybean fields south of I-70 have been harvested and a few fields north of the interstate highway have matured, but none had been cut as of Friday. The soybean crop was rated three percent very poor, 16 percent poor, 40 percent fair, 36 percent good and five percent excellent.</p>
<p>Soybean plants were dropping leaves on 20 percent of the acreage, compared with the average of 78 percent.</p>
<p>Winter wheat seeding remained at one percent, compared with four percent last year and three percent on average.</p>
<p>Pasture was rated six percent very poor, 20 percent poor, 41 percent fair, 30 percent good and three percent excellent.</p>
<p>Topsoil moisture was rated 27 percent short to very short, compared with 49 percent last week. Seventy-three percent was rated adequate to surplus, compared with 51 percent last week.</p>
<p>There were 4.5 days suitable for fieldwork for the week ended Friday.</p>
