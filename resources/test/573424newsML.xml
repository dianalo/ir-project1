<p>Parents worried about whether their babies are normal can feel reassured if they fidget, Austrian researchers suggested on Friday.</p>
<p>Brain-damaged babies almost always lie unnaturally still, Heinz Prechtl of the physiology department at Karl-Franzens University of Graz and colleagues reported in the Lancet medical journal.</p>
<p>They studied 130 infants born across Austria and found 96 percent of those who fidgeted normally were indeed mentally normal, while 95 percent of those who did not fidget were found to have brain abnormalities.</p>
<p>"Our technique is simple, non-intrusive, reliable, quick and can be done in very young infants," they wrote.</p>
