<p>Chilean blue chips on Thursday rallied to close nearly one percent higher on buy orders from cash-rich pension funds, traders said.</p>
<p>That may have set the stage for a wave of profit-taking at the opening on Friday, they added.</p>
<p>"The market could be hit by a technical adjustment at the opening, but the underlying trend is upward," said one dealer.</p>
<p>The selective IPSA index ended 0.84 percent higher at 99.88 points. The general IGPA index gained one percent to 5,494.87 points.</p>
<p>Volume held fairly steady at 10.4 billion pesos.  </p>
<p>Although turnover remained light, traders said investors were more optmistic amid signs that the pension funds -- the largest institutional investors in Chile -- were starting to return to the stock market after months on the sidelines.</p>
<p>The funds, which control $27 billion, have around 28 percent of their portfolios in stocks, lower than their usual level of 31 percent, said dealers.</p>
<p>High domestic interest rates have resulted in investors switching funds from the bolsa to fixed-income instruments.  </p>
<p>Leading gainers included Banco O'Higgins, which rose amid expectations the bank will benefit most from a debt deal between the Chilean central bank and Banco de Santiago. The agreement clears the way for a merger between the two private banks, said traders.</p>
<p>O'Higgins closed up 4.31 percent at 1,669 pesos.</p>
<p>Santiago's shareholders are seen losing out under the pact. The bank's B shares dropped 7.86 percent to 12.9 pesos.</p>
<p>Fertilizer maker Soquimich and supermarket chain Santa Isabel rose amid speculation the companies will report solid third-quarter earnings, traders said.</p>
