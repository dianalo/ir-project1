<p>Nextel Communications Inc said Monday it added a record 122,600 digital subscribers during the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>As of March 31, Nextel said it had some 422,900 digital subscriber units in service in hundreds of cities across the U.S. The increase is a 70 percent jump over fourth quarter results when 72,300 digital subscriber units were added.</p>
<p>The company also said there was an increase in average monthly revenue per digital unit to $59 in the first quarter from a fourth quarter level of $56.</p>
<p>"Strong subscriber growth and the early option exercise and enhanced financing from the McCaw family are significant votes of confidence and confirm that we're on target with our business plan," said chief executive Dan Akerson.</p>
<p>"We continue to aggressively build out our network and now have rolled out an equally aggressive advertising and marketing program to fuel our growth."</p>
<p>"Nextel is finally on the road to fulfilling the promise of high quality wireless communications for work groups," commented Craig O. McCaw, Nextel's leading shareholder.</p>
