<p>Kinay Narayana Shashikala could be on more lips than the name of the Miss World winner on Saturday if she carries out a threat to lead a multiple suicide protest against the beauty pageant.</p>
<p>Bangalore police chief S.C. Burman played down the danger posed by the second-year law student and leader of the Mahila Jagran Samiti (Forum for Awakening Women).</p>
<p>"Do you think they are motivated like the LTTE (Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam) are?" the police commissioner told Reuters on Wednesday, referring to Sri Lanka's Tamil rebels, who are fighting for a homeland in the Indian Ocean island's north and east.</p>
<p>An estimated two billion viewers in 115 countries will be watching the three-hour extravaganza planned for Saturday at Bangalore's Chinnaswamy cricket stadium.</p>
<p>The security forces will be watching for Shashikala, and her supporters, who say they will mingle among the expected crowd of 20,000 and set their saris alight after first swallowing cyanide to lessen the pain of burning alive.</p>
<p>"Whatever amount of security we will sneak into the stadium. We don't require kerosene or petrol to douse ourselves, our nylon saris are inflammable," Shashikala has warned.</p>
<p>Shashikala, a stocky woman in her twenties, who teaches self-defence to counter physical harassment by men -- known locally as "Eve teasing" -- says fighting exploitation of women in India is her main concern.</p>
<p>"We want to bring awareness among poor women and fight against exploitation of women in all walks of life."</p>
<p>In an Asian Age newspaper article on Wednesday, Shashikala was asked why she did not attack the big issue of prostitution in Karnataka instead of the Miss World pageant being staged in the state. Bangalore is the capital of Karnataka.</p>
<p>"There are only 500 members in the Mahila Jagran now. That is not enough," she replied.</p>
<p>One man has already turned himself into a human torch to protest against the pageant being staged in India. But that was hundreds of miles away from Bangalore.</p>
<p>Police could detain Shashikala and her followers as a preventive step, just as they did in Bombay last month when a man threated to burn himself at a Michael Jackson concert.</p>
<p>Unlike Western feminists the west, Shashikala, who favours saris and chididar pyjamas, is a traditionalist who fears shows like Miss World will undermine Indian culture.</p>
<p>Miss World Limited international president Julia Morley invited Shashikala and her followers to meet her and the 88 young women contesting the title to come and talk to them. Shashikala said she was talking to no-one until the show was called off.</p>
