<p>Bangladesh's booming ready-made garments industry, facing threats by the U.S. government to cut imports, says it has removed child workers from its factories.</p>
<p>"Garment factories are now free of child labour," Redwan Ahmed, chief of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association, or BGMEA, said Thursday night.</p>
<p>"It's a memorable day for the garment sector of Bangladesh. I invite the importers, retailers and consumers from USA, Europe, Canada to come forward to patronise Bangladeshi garments produced in child-labour free factories" he said.</p>
<p>The BGMEA chief declared that from now on, no garment factory of Bangladesh would employ workers under the age of 14.</p>
<p>"Violators will be subject to heavy penalty," he told representatives of international agencies, officials of the American embassy in Dhaka and local agents of U.S. buyers.</p>
<p>He said factories would be opened to international inspection from Friday.</p>
<p>Ahmed said the children retrenched from jobs were being sent to schools run under a rehabilitation programme.</p>
<p>BGMEA, the International Labour Organisation and the U.N. Children's Fund were taking more than 10,500 child workers, the majority of them girls, to schools under an agreement signed by the three organisations in July, 1995.</p>
<p>Under the agreement, child workers had to be phased out by Oct. 31 and had to be motivated to attend schools.</p>
<p>Bangladesh's garment manufacturers agreed to the terms after the U.S. government threatened early last year to stop importing textiles from countries using workers below the age of 14.</p>
<p>The United States buys nearly 60 percent of Bangladeshi garments, worth $2.5 billion in the last fiscal year (July 1995-June 1996).</p>
<p>Ahmed said some 5,500 child workers were already enrolled in 247 schools in Chittagong, Dhaka and Narayanganj industrial town. "Some 5,000 more are in line," he said.</p>
<p>Each of the child workers is being paid 300 taka ($7) every month, until they reach the age of 15 years, as compensation against lost income.</p>
<p>The ILO, UNICEF, U.S. government and BGMEA are sharing the cost of the programme.</p>
<p>Factory owners said the retrenched workers in schools would get back their jobs when they reached the age of 15.</p>
<p>The U.S. Ambassador in Dhaka, David N. Merrill, lauded the Bangladesh garment sector, saying that dropping child workers would enhance the country's image overseas and help weather adverse publicity.</p>
<p>"Without child labour, Bangladeshi garments will be in a better position in the competitive international market," he told the BGMEA leaders.</p>
<p>Child labour has been one of the major social problems in impoverished Bangladesh. The UNICEF representative in Dhaka, Rolf C. Carriere, said children under the age of 15 years were still being employed in 300 different types of jobs in the country.</p>
