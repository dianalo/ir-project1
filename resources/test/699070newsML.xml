<p>The U.S. Treasury has overstated the inflation-adjusted cost of federal borrowing costs, the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"When computing net interest costs on the outstanding bonds that make up the federal debt, the Treasury ignores real capital gains and losees, that is, changes in prices as a result of inflation and changes in interest rates," a study to be soon published by the Chicago Fed said.</p>
<p>The study, available in New York, was conducted by Chicago Fed economist George Hall and Chicago Fed consultant and University of Chicago economics professor Thomas Sargent.  </p>
<p>Hall and Sargent recalculated the cost of federal borrowing by taking into account the real capital gains and losses and found that "the true inflation-adjusted borrowing costs of the government are substantially lower and more variable than the Treasury reports."</p>
<p>The authors said the miscalculation affects issues related to government borrowings -- from the new inflation-indexed bonds to the proposed balanced budget agreement.</p>
<p>The study found that in 11 of the past 35 years, inflation was higher than the interest rates the U.S. government paid on its debt.  </p>
<p>"During these 11 years, the government actually paid a negative real rate of interest on its debt," said the researchers who also noted the risks inherent to "playing with the yield curve."</p>
<p>"Issuing short-maturity debt when short-maturity yields are low and issuing long-maturity debt when long-maturity yields are low ... amounts to betting against financial markets on future movements of interest rates and inflation," they said, pointing out the "two movements are notoriously hard to predict."</p>
<p>Hall and Sargent found that the U.S. Treasury could have slowed the growth of the U.S. debt and lowered the debt services by issuing more long-term securities in 1960-80 and more short-term instruments after 1989.</p>
