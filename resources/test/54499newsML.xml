<p>Opposition parties in Niger have formed a united front to campaign for democracy and challenge the rule of President Ibrahim Bare Mainssara, a spokesman said on Sunday.</p>
<p>The opposition contests the results of the May 7-8 presidential election during which Mainassara, who seized power in a coup last January, sacked the electoral commission and appointed a new body which declared him the winner.</p>
<p>A statement by the country's eight opposition parties said they had agreed on Saturday to form a Front for the Restoration and Defence of Democracy (FRDD).</p>
<p>"The illegitimate nature of the regime in power today constitutes the principal obstacle in the way of a rebound in economic activity and the improvement of the lives of the people," the statement added.</p>
<p>Mainassara's four civilian opponents spent two weeks under house arrest after the elections and the Supreme Court rejected a request by three of them to scrap the results.</p>
<p>Niger's three main opposition parties plan to boycott parliamentary elections on November 10 unless the presidential ballot was cancelled.</p>
<p>Mainassara seized power in January, ending a paralysing 16-month political standoff between civilian president Mahamane Ousmane and his opponents who held the majority in parliament.</p>
<p>The new 83-seat parliament to be elected in November will replace the military National Salvation Council appointed by Mainassara after the coup.</p>
