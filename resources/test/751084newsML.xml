<title>AUSTRALIA: Australia posts negative quarterly inflation.</title>
<headline>Australia posts negative quarterly inflation.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1997-07-23</dateline>

<p>Australia announced its first quarter of negative inflation for five years on Wednesday, putting further downward pressure on interest rates.</p>
<p>The headline consumer price index for the June quarter fell by 0.2 percent for an annual rise of 0.3 percent, the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) said.</p>
<p>It was the first quarter of deflation since June 1992.</p>
<p>The underlying rate -- used by the Reserve Bank of Australia to help set monetary policy and watched closely by the markets -- fell to an annual 1.7 percent, its lowest rate since records began in 1971.</p>
<p>The ABS is due on Thursday to announce May quarter wages data and economists said the combination of low inflation and weak wages data could persuade the Reserve Bank to cut interest rates for the fifth time in a year as early as Friday.</p>
<p>Underlying inflation is now below the Reserve Bank's own target band of two to three percent, allowing it more flexibility on official interest rates despite upward pressure on rates in the United States.</p>
<p>The previous four cuts, each of 0.5 percentage points, have so far failed to work their way through to boost consumer and business confidence.  </p>
<p>It was the first quarter of headline deflation since June 1992. Most analysts had expected June quarter CPI to fall by 0.1 percent for an annual rate of 0.5 percent and underlying inflation to rise by 0.4 percent for an annual 1.7 percent.</p>
<p>The ABS is due on Thursday to announce May quarter wages data and economists said moderate figures could persuade the Reserve Bank of Australia to cut interest rates for the fifth time in a year with a cut coming as early as Friday.  </p>
<p>Underlying inflation -- which excludes from the CPI basket items that are highly volatile, follow seasonal patterns or are largely affected by policy decisions -- is now below the Reserve Bank's own annual target band of two to three percent, allowing it more flexibility on official interest rates.</p>
<p>The previous four RBA cuts, each of 50 basis points taking the official cash rate to 5.5 percent, have so far failed to work their way through to boost consumer and business confidence.  </p>
<p>Economists pointed out that comments by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan overnight appeared to have relieved pressure for a hike in U.S. interest rates.</p>
<p>"It's a splendid result and we think it meets the second of three conditions for a rate cut to be announced on Friday," said John Edwards, chief economist at HSBC Markets.</p>
<p>"The other one was the confirmed reluctance of the Federal Reserve to raise rates and the next condition is tomorrow's average weekly earnings which in our view have to display moderate overall earnings growth to permit another rate cut."  </p>
<p>Rob Henderson, chief economist at Dresdner Australia, said headline deflation would have a powerful psychological impact, but the RBA would pay more attention to the underlying rate.</p>
<p>"We are going through a system now of ticking off indicators," Henderson said.</p>
<p>"The next one is wages and then the icing on the cake will be the retail trade and building approvals figures next week, which we think are going to be weak. So given a good inflation outlook and weak indicators there is a 50/50 chance that the bank will cut again," he said.  </p>
<p>The Australian dollar eased slightly and bonds jumped in immediate reaction to the second quarter inflation report, which came in slightly below median expectations.</p>
<p>The dollar was US$0.7367/72 compared with US$0.7372/77 just before the data release while the September 10-year bond futures contract was 93.595 against a pre-data 93.555. September bill futures also rose, moving to 94.96 from 94.92.</p>
