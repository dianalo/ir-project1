<p>Transport Minister Vilis Krishtopans is considering resigning, the transport ministry said, amid a growing corruption row linked to ministers who have posts as company directors as well as their ministerial jobs.</p>
<p>Under anti-corruption laws, ministers and members of parliament (MPs) are not allowed to combine their official work with employment in the private sector.</p>
<p>The transport ministry said in a statement that Krishtopans was considering resigning even if the results of investigations into the anti-corruption scandal do not compromise him.</p>
<p>Krishtopans is among a number of ministers and MPs who have been named as holding directors' posts according to lists in the hands of the state company register.</p>
<p>The job of Economics Minister Guntar Krasts is also under threat due to the same reasons.</p>
<p>The transport ministry said that Prime Minister Andris Shkele has been informed that Krishtopans was considering resigning.</p>
