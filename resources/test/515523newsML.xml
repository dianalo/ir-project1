<p>Swiss telecommunications group Ascom Holding AG said it had signed an agreement to sell subsidiary Nexion pending approval by regulatory authorities in the United States.</p>
<p>"A contract for the sale of Nexion was signed on Tuesday, April 15, with an internationally active large company," Ascom said in a statement.  </p>
<p>Ascom did not elaborate on the buyer but did say regulatory approval had to come from the United States "among other".</p>
<p>"Both contractual partnmers have agreed not to reveal any details of the negotiations," it added.</p>
<p>Nexion was spun off from troubled U.S. subsidiary Timeplex in 1994.</p>
<p>Nexion is a small development company that is working on a universal telecommunications switch which would connect local area networks, wide area networks and public networks.</p>
<p>Ascom's original intention was for Timeplex to be able to finance the expected start-up losses at Nexion for its switch.</p>
