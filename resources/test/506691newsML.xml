<p>Author Michael Dorris, famed for his collaborations with wife Louise Erdrich and for a book on raising a brain damaged child, took his own life in a motel room here, police said on Monday.</p>
<p>Police said the 52-year old author of "The Broken Cord," a book about his difficulties raising a child suffering from Foetal Alcohol Syndrome, suffocated himself on Friday with a plastic bag after checking into a motel under an assumed name.</p>
<p>A note was left at the scene but police declined to disclose its details. An autopsy report from the state medical examiner was expected on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The news of Dorris's death sent shock waves through the U.S. literary community with many, including close friends and associates, saying they could not believe the news. American Indian groups with whom Dorris worked closely for decades also expressed their dismay.</p>
<p>A family spokesman said Dorris was in the midst of a divorce from Erdrich, his wife of 15 years and his closest literary collaborator.</p>
<p>The two had written one book together and had edited each other's work for years. Erdrich dedicated her bestselling novels, including "The Beet Queen," to Dorris and he, in turn, had dedicated his books to her.</p>
<p>John Baker, an editor at Publishers' Weekly, recalled Dorris's work and said, "It is difficult to believe that someone who cherished difficult lives would end his own.'</p>
<p>In a statement, Erdrich said, "Michael did a great deal of good for the world. He is deeply grieved by his family and friends." She asked that donations in his memory be made to the Seattle Foundation for Foetal Alcohol Syndrome.</p>
<p>His agent and lawyer Charles Rembar said Dorris's death "was a shock and a surprise given what I know of him. He had a bunch of good qualities -- he was bright, witty and likable. If you had to pick out a person least likely to commit suicide it would be him."</p>
<p>Dorris and Erdrich co-wrote "The Crown of Columbus" in 1991 after a publisher agreed to pay the couple $1.5 million on the basis of a five-page outline.</p>
<p>Born of mixed Irish, French and American Indian ancestry and raised, in part, on a reservation in Montana, Dorris was the author of two novels, including the recently published "Cloud Chamber." But he was best known for "The Broken Cord," his bestselling 1989 memoir of adopting an American Indian child who was born brain damaged as a result of his mother's heavy drinking while pregnant.</p>
<p>Dorris was the first unmarried American male to legally adopt a child. His son Abel died at age 23 in a car accident in 1992. Dorris also adopted two other Native American children who suffered from a lesser form of the disease called Foetal Alcohol Effect.</p>
