<p>Following are highlights of the midday briefing by the European Commission on Tuesday:</p>
<p>Spokesman Joao Vale de Almeida said the Commission's midday briefing would be at 1145/1045 GMT on Wednesday instead of 1200/1100 GMT.</p>
<p>Vale de Almeida said Commissioner Edith Cresson would hold a news conference on the Fifth Framework Programme for research and technological development at 1200/1100 GMT in Strasbourg. He said she would be followed, around 1230/1130 GMT, by Commissioner Neil Kinnock on road safety.</p>
<p>Vale de Almeida said there would be a technical briefing on the G-24 meeting on Bulgaria at 1300/1200 GMT on Wednesday in the Breydel news room.</p>
<p>Vale de Almeida announced a technical briefing on the Euro-Mediterranean conference in Malta at 1215/1115 GMT on Thursday.</p>
<p>Spokesman Peter Guilford said the Commission regretted the lack of a consensus on a United Nations resolution to denounce human rights violations in China. He said the Commission still believed it was a good idea.</p>
<p>Guilford said the three ways to pressure China to apply human rights were to use trade means, to raise the issue at political level, publicly if necessary, and to act at grass-roots level to try to improve such things as the treatment of women, the electoral practices at village level, the training of judges and lawyers and other projects.</p>
