<p>It will be business as usual in Indonesia following the sweeping victory by the ruling Golkar party in this week's general elections, political analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>The system put in place during President Suharto's 30-year rule ensured Golkar would win, they said. By late Friday Golkar had just over 74 percent of the valid ballots counted from Thursday's poll for 425 elected seats in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The Moslem-oriented United Development Party (PPP) had almost 23 percent and the fragmented Christian-National Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) a disastrous three percent.</p>
<p>"The results are not surprising," a senior Asian diplomat said.</p>
<p>He said the vote was about seats in a rubber-stamp parliament -- albeit one that is starting to show some signs of life -- and not government policy or President Suharto's record.</p>
<p>"It is not a mandate for Suharto, it's not a judgment on him," the diplomat added.</p>
<p>The key election will come next March when the 75-year-old president is widely expected to seek a seventh five-year term in office. Political and economic analysts are keenly watching who he will choose as a running mate and, given his age, potential successor.</p>
<p>But the violence of the election campaign -- the worst political turmoil in three decades -- must give the government food for thought in a country which has seen increasing turbulence over the past year.</p>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of PPP supporters took to the streets in Jakarta and central Java, clashing with Golkar partisans and security forces, who showed considerable restraint in handling a potentially explosive situation.</p>
<p>"The key issue is whether the youngsters will get off the streets and go home after the elections," a senior diplomatic source said towards the end of the campaign.</p>
<p>The possibility of violence, particularly in Jakarta itself, if PPP supporters feel cheated and refuse to accept the election results remains a concern for investors in an economy that has developed into one of the Asian tigers under Suharto's leadership.</p>
<p>Both the PPP and the Independent Election Monitoring Committee (KIPP) charged on Friday that there had been fraud in the election process. PPP campaign manager Jusuf Sjakir said his party would decide next week whether or not to accept the outcome.</p>
<p>Analyst Dewi Fortuna Anwar, of the Centre for Information and Development Studies (CIDES), said however she believed it was the system itself that worked against the minority parties.</p>
<p>"In terms of the election itself, I think it's free, so it is not the election itself that is the problem. If Golkar wins, I don't think it will be because of vote manipulation or anything like that," she said.</p>
<p>"It's just that conditions are made which means it is quite hard for Golkar to lose."</p>
<p>The government has attributed sporadic outbursts of rioting over the past year, mainly in Java -- home to 60 percent of the country's 200 million people -- to shadowy groups intent on destabilising the nation.</p>
<p>"The small group is trying to impose its cause on the bigger one (the community). In fact, the group that is struggling for democracy is behaving undemocratically. We can tell which is right and which is wrong," the official Antara news agency quoted Suharto as saying on Friday.</p>
<p>Political analysts have attributed pre-campaign riots to socio-economic tensions, frustrations at a rigid and authoritarian system and anger over pervasive corruption.</p>
<p>Analysts say there is no concrete evidence of a concerted and effective anti-government campaign. If one appeared, the goverment would have cause for concern.</p>
<p>"No-one has been able to bring together all the disparate elements under one umbrella to challenge Suharto's 'new order' rule," one diplomat said.</p>
<p>"Nobody expected the election to provide a vehicle for change ... most people believe change will only come after Suharto," he added.</p>
