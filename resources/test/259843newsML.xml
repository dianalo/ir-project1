<p>STOCKHOLM, Dec 16 (Reuter) - The mood of Swedish debt markets on Monday was optimistic due to the EU-decision on the stability-pact at the weekend as well as expectations of an upbeat inflation report and a cut in the repo rate on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Riksbank will present its final inflation report for the year and announce a repo operation that will run three weeks to cover the holiday period. A Reuter poll found expectations for a 25 basis point cut to 4.10 percent.</p>
<p>"The yields will probably be stay around today's levels on Tuesday if the Riksbank does not cut the repo rate by more or less than expected," one dealer said.  </p>
<p>Six-month T-bill rates fell five basis points to 3.81 percent and ten-year bond yields by six to 6.89 percent.</p>
<p>The trade in the crown was steady despite expectations the crown would strengthen considerably against the mark.</p>
<p>"The mark was strong against the lira and the French franc and that stopped the crown from further strengthening," one dealer said. "But I think the crown will strengthen against the mark tomorrow."</p>
<p>The crown gained a little to 4.3950 against the mark versus 4.4000 late Friday.</p>
