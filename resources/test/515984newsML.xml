<p>In Home Health Inc said Thursday it is studying ways to cut costs and restore profits.</p>
<p>"We are continuing the pursuit of specialized programs to set In Home Health apart from other traditional home health care companies and are also analyzing cost-cutting strategies in order to return the company to profitability," Mark Gildea, chief executive officer, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Revenues for the second quarter ended March 31 dropped to $31.4 million from $31.8 million a year ago. Its net loss was $0.07 a share, compared with a year-ago loss of $0.03.  </p>
<p>For the first six months, sales dropped to $63.0 million from $64.3 million, while the net loss rose to $0.11 a share from a loss of $0.06 a share.</p>
<p>In Home Health said its Extended Hours, Infusion and Hospice revenues for the first six months of fiscal 1997, ended March 31, rose 38 percent from the prior year.</p>
<p>Revenue from the Visit division, which provides short-term visits to a client's home, was 15 percent below a year ago.</p>
<p>"Although Extended Hours, Hospice and Infusion revenue continue to increase, the associated profit margins on these services have failed to meet our expectations," Gildea said. "The profit margins on this revenue, coupled with the decline in Visit division volume, continue to negatively impact the profitability of the company."</p>
<p>Separately, the company said it has been notified that the U.S. District Court granted its motion to set aside a decision by the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services, which had denied the company reimbursement of some costs for providing physical therapy services in 1992. The matter was remanded to Health and Human Services for further proceedings, it added.</p>
