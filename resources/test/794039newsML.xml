<p>A U.S. health panel Tuesday recommended a review of donated blood over the last decade to help trace transmission of the potentially deadly hepatitis C virus.</p>
<p>The review could affect 250,000 to 425,000 people, according to Dr. Stephen Nightingale, executive secretary of the advisory committee, which reports to the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>The panel, which included blood bank professionals, recommended a "lookback" for all patients who received blood from donors whose blood now tests positive for hepatitis C.</p>
<p>"That means that we identify a donor who has become hepatitis C positive, and we look back to all of the people who have received blood products from that person," Nightingale said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>The committee urged that this review date back to 1987, he said.</p>
<p>Nightingale acknowledged this could be a cumbersome process, but said much of the donated blood could be traced through blood banks to hospitals and ultimately to those who received blood. He noted that such "lookbacks" had been successful in Britain and Canada.</p>
<p>In addition, the committee recommended that patients who received donated blood before 1992, when a highly reliable screen for the disease was in use at blood banks, should consult their physicians to determine whether they needed to be tested for hepatitis C.</p>
<p>Donors who reliably test negative when they first give blood and then test positive later prompted a recommendation that all blood given by those donors between the first and second testing should be traced.</p>
<p>Hepatitis C causes an estimated 8,000 deaths in the United States each year, but can be effectively treated with interferon. Officials at the National Institutes of Health have estimated that this number could triple in the next 10 to 20 years.</p>
<p>It can cause progressive liver disease and liver failure and require liver transplantation. However, there is often a long period where no symptoms are evident and some patients spontaneously are cured of the infection without ever knowing they have contracted it, Nightingale said.</p>
<p>Those who are infected should be "very prudent" about consuming alcohol, Nightingale said.</p>
<p>The committee stressed that hepatitis C can be contracted through other means besides transfusions, especially through contaminated intravenous needles.</p>
