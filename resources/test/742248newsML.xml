<headline>BA sets date for cabin crew union talks.</headline>

<p>British Airways Plc moved a step closer to ending a damaging pay dispute with its main cabin crew union when it announced on Monday it would hold talks with union leaders later this week.</p>
<p>The airline will meet BASSA, the largest cabin crew union, at 0900 GMT on Wednesday at London's Heathrow airport to receive the union's proposals on how to achieve the 42 million pounds ($70.5 million) savings wanted in a pay restructuring dispute, BA said.</p>
<p>"We are pleased that BASSA has accepted our invitation and that it is now in a position to present firm proposals on how it would achieve the cabin crew savings which are needed to keep the airline competitive," BA chief executive Robert Ayling said in a statement.</p>
<p>Ayling said he hoped the talks would be constructive and would lead to a "speedy end" to the dispute.</p>
<p>No union representative was immediately available to comment on the talks.</p>
<p>The purpose of the meeting, BA said, is to "receive and clarify the proposals so the airline can subsequently evaluate the details put forward by the union."</p>
<p>The talks will be conducted through the British corporate conciliation service ACAS.</p>
<p>BASSA, a division of the Transport and General Workers' Union (T&amp;G) has accepted in principle the need for the target 42 million pound savings, part of the airline's one billion pound ($1.6 billion) cost-cutting and increased efficency drive, BA said.</p>
<p>But the union says it wants BA to consider its alternative proposals on how to make the savings.</p>
<p>BA said earlier on Monday that as long as the proposals met its target 42 million pound figure in a way acceptable to all parties, it would then seek a process to move things forward jointly with BASSA -- representing 8,500 cabin crew members -- and Cabin Crew 89, the second cabin crew union representing 3,500 members.</p>
<p>The dispute over the pay restructuring programme led to a 72-hour strike by cabin crew earlier in the month, an action that disrupted hundreds of flights and, BA estimates, cost the company tens of millions of pounds. ($ = 0.595 British Pounds)</p>
