<p>The U.S. National Science Foundation, which funded much of the original research for the Internet, said on Wednesday it would now focus on scientific uses for the global computer network now that commercial demand is exploding.</p>
<p>"The Internet is no longer primarily a medium for the exchange of information in the scientific community -- the original reason for NSF involvement," NSF Deputy Director Joseph Bordogna said in a statement.</p>
<p>Bordogna also said the NSF will not renew its agreement with Network Solutions Inc. to administer domain names, or Internet addresses, and may even terminate the agreement before its March 1998 expiration date.</p>
<p>"NSF is confident the Internet community will develop mechanisms to handle Internet registration without NSF involvement," he said.</p>
<p>The NSF would focus on matters of significance to the scientific community as the next generation of the Internet is developed, Bordogna said.</p>
<p>A February report by NSF's Inspector General recommended continued government oversight of Internet registration and the imposition of an excise tax on such registration.</p>
<p>"The long-term issues raised by the report may indeed require additional government oversight, and we are referring the report to appropriate policymakers in the administration," Bordogna said.</p>
