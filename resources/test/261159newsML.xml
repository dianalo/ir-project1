<p>Economy Ministry data indicate Argentina's unemployment rate is 16.3 percent, lower than the 17.3 percent announced by the official statistics agency last week, Ambito Financiero newspaper said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The official INDEC agency announced Friday that its semiannual survey of 25 major centers showed the jobless rate in October was 17.3 percent, up from 17 percent in May and from 16.4 percent in October 1995.</p>
<p>However, Ambito Financiero quoted top Economy Ministry officials as saying the rate is 16.3 percent when taking into account mid-sized and small cities.  That compares with 16.5 percent in May and 15.9 percent in October 1995 when using this calculation.</p>
<p>The rate lowered thanks to the creation of 200,000 jobs in some of these smaller centers, Ambito said, quoting Economy Ministry Cabinet Chief Carlos Rodriguez and deputy Planning Secretary Javier Ortiz Batalla.</p>
