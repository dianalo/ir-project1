<p>U.S. spot product markets were mostly subdued Thursday in a shortened trading day ahead of the three-day holiday weekend.</p>
<p>NYMEX ended trading at 1300 EST (1800 GMT) and will be closed Friday in observance of Independence Day.</p>
<p>On the NYMEX, August gasoline futures fell 1.37 cents to settle at 57.60 cents a gallon and August heating oil futures dropped 2.27 cents to end at 52.65 cents.</p>
<p>MIDCONTINENT</p>
<p>Differentials were steady to weaker in the Midwest, with values on third-cycle Group Three low sulfur diesel and Group conventional unleaded easing a half cent, traders said, amid perceptions of ample supply.</p>
<p>End-month Group diesel sold for 0.75 cent over the August futures, while prompt material was talked steady at 1.00 cent over, players said. Chicago material was offered at 1.0 cent under the screen -- stable with Wednesday diffs.</p>
<p>On the gasoline side, Group conventional unleaded sold for 2.0 cents over the screen, a half cent weaker than Wednesday differentials. Chicago material was stable, however, exchanging hands at 2.0 cents over.</p>
<p>"A few deals managed to get done," one trader said, despite the exodus of market players ahead of the holiday.</p>
<p>U.S. GULF</p>
<p>Reformulated A1 gasoline remained strong Thursday, with players putting nearby barrels between 3.00 and 3.25 cents over the August NYMEX futures.</p>
<p>"Nobody down here has much, and there's a couple people who need to buy," one trader said.</p>
<p>Prompt regular conventional M1 gasoline differentials remained firm between 1.75 and 2.00 cents under the August futures, according to traders, though no confirmed deals were seen.</p>
<p>NEW YORK HARBOR</p>
<p>Trading appeared extremely quiet Thursday as players abandoned offices ahead of the weekend.</p>
<p>Prompt regular conventional M2 gasoline differentials hovered between 2.50 and 2.25 cents under the August futures, even with the levels reached during late Thursday's strength.</p>
<p>Reformulated A2 gasoline differentials were seen unchanged between 0.25 cent under to even with the August futures.</p>
<p>Low sulphur diesel for nearby delivery was seen near 0.50 cent over the August futures, near the lower end of the week's range, traders said.</p>
