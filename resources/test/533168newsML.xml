<p>Medical experts said on Tuesday that Gulf War veterans with psychological or nerve problems should have detailed examinations to uncover any potential illnesses that may have been caused by Iraqi nerve gas.</p>
<p>Although there was no conclusive evidence that exposure to low levels of nerve gas causes long-term health problems, if it did they would probably be nerve or psychological problems, the panel of medical experts said in a report.</p>
<p>The panel recommended fuller examinations because of the Defence Department's announcement that about 20,000 U.S. Gulf War troops could have been exposed to nerve gas when Army engineers blew up an Iraqi weapons dump after the 1991 war.</p>
<p>The Defence Department said it would carry out the recommendations made by the committee of medical directors and professors at the federal Institute of Medicine set up to evaluate its programmes for Gulf War veterans with illnesses.</p>
<p>Defence officials said many U.S. troops were in the area when the dump containing Iraqi nerve gas weapons was blown up. But they said they had no hard evidence that any troops were exposed to nerve gas.</p>
<p>Dr. Margit Bleecker, a member of the Institute of Medicine committee and director of the Centre for Occupational and Environmental Neurology at Baltimore, said the committee recommended fuller examinations in case U.S. troops were exposed to traces of war gas and it does turn out to cause illnesses scientists have not yet identified.</p>
<p>"We don't know if there was an exposure," she said in an interview. "So we want to make sure that if there are problems related to the nervous system that those will be detected."</p>
<p>The committee also recommended military doctors who examine Gulf War veterans have more ready access to neurologists and psychiatrists who may be able to recognise such illnesses.</p>
<p>"Let me assure our Gulf War veterans and you that we will continue our efforts to understand these illnesses and to provide high quality care," Acting Assistant Defence Secretary Edward Martin told the institute in a letter.</p>
<p>"We will incorporate your recommendations into our programme."</p>
