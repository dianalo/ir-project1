<p>U.S. sour crude differentials continued to languish on Monday, experiencing pressure from active talk of foreign barrels on offer to the U.S. Gulf at a time of weak demand.</p>
<p>The basic bearish fundamental outlook was furthered on market talk Mobil Corp's Joliet, Illinois refinery experienced an incident over the weekend, leaving the plant awash in sour crude waiting for processing.</p>
<p>"We hear they had problems. That just means there is more sour crude without a home," said one Midwest crude trader.</p>
<p>Mobil was not immediately available for comment.  </p>
<p>April West Texas Intermediate/Cushing deflated 70 cts to $20.65-75 a barrel, reflective of paper market technical selling patterns, traders said.</p>
<p>The late performance in the Mar/Apr WTI roll pushed the spread to 25-27 cts, after trading early in the morning at 23 cts and in the early afternoon at 28 cts.</p>
<p>Effectively, the March WTI/Cushing was valued at $20.95-$21.05, 40 cts lower than late on Friday.</p>
<p>March pipeline scheduling deadlines were set for Tuesday, leaving much of Monday's activity "clean-up" work ahead of the April month taking full precedence.</p>
<p>On the grades, Light Louisiana Sweet/St. James talked late at a 40-50 cts premium in the March, but April LLS hung back from the gains in the spot month at WTI/Cushing +25-35 cts.</p>
<p>Midland/WTI was valued around 40-50 cts under the WTI/Cushing, and Heavy Louisiana Sweet/Empire at roughly 40-50 cts above the March WTI/Cushing.</p>
<p>The sour side of the market heard West Texas Sour/Midland done as weak as a $2.75 discount to the WTI/Cushing, only nominally better than the weakest deals on Friday.</p>
<p>"This is the first time I've seen the sour this weak in the last two years," said one broker.</p>
<p>Further pressure was generated for the sours on talk a second cargo of Iraqi crude was being shown for the U.S. Gulf for second-half April arrival.</p>
<p>Traders said the parcel was offered at May WTI/Cushing -$2.10. Last week, traders said Bayoil was offering first-half April delivery of Basrah Light at April WTI -$2.00.</p>
