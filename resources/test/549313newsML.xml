<p>U.S. stocks steamrolled higher on Wednesday, staging a broad advance that carried the Dow industrials above the 7000 level for the first time in nearly seven weeks.</p>
<p>The rally extended a fierce rebound that has seen blue chip stocks recoup more than 600 of the nearly 700 points shed during a one-month sell-off and recapture much of the swagger that served as a trademark of their historic bull run.</p>
<p>The Dow gained 47 points to close unofficially at 7009.  </p>
<p>Analysts generally remained reluctant to declare the market's sharp correction at an end, at least until stocks find their way back to record ground. Even so, several marvelled at the pace of the rebound.</p>
<p>"This market truly has been manic depressive in the last six weeks," said Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. "We corrected in four weeks and rallied almost all the way back in about two."  </p>
<p>The rally saw investors shrug off a report that showed the U.S. economy grew far faster in the first quarter than economists thought.</p>
<p>The Commerce Department reported GDP expanded at a 5.6 percent annual rate in the first three months of this year, its fastest pace in more than nine years and much stronger than Wall Street forecasts for a 4.1 percent rate.</p>
<p>But some analysts said the GDP data were skewed by accumulation of inventories, a factor that suggested growth would moderate in the second quarter.  </p>
<p>"Going into the fourth quarter (of 1996) the expectation was that the economy was going to turn sluggish, so companies let inventories draw down," said Phil Orlando, chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management.</p>
<p>"It appears we played a little bit of catch-up in the first quarter, but we think that build-up is over," he added.</p>
<p>If further economic data affirms the belief that growth is moderating and inflation is under control, the market may well advance to new highs as investors shake off concerns about further Federal Reserve monetary tightenings.  </p>
<p>But key manufacturing and jobs data are still due this week -- reports believed to be among those the Fed watches closest in gauging inflation pressures. As a result, few on Wall Street are modifying interest rate outlooks yet.</p>
<p>"We remain convinced the Fed will tighten some more," Orlando said. "Nothing we've seen changes that opinion."</p>
<p>And if rates are in fact headed higher, the recent bounce may be close to its conclusion, some said.</p>
<p>"It's certainly difficult to expect the market to make much headway here with a rate increase still on the table," said Dick Stein, vice president at U.S. Clearing Corp.  </p>
<p>Retailers and other cyclical issues turned in a solid performance, boosted by the robust economic picture. Woolworth Corp gained 1-1/2 to 21-1/2 and Dayton Hudson Corp rose 2-1/2 to 45.</p>
<p>Technology stocks were also strong, led by a resurgent networking group. Ascend Communications Corp surged 4-5/16 to 45-3/4, Bay Networks Inc gained 1-1/4 to 17-3/4 and Cisco Systems Inc rose 1-3/4 to 51-3/4.</p>
<p>Sinter Metals Inc soared 9-35/64 to 36-35/64 after Britain's GKN Plc offered to buy the auto parts maker for $37 per share.  </p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 index rose 7.29 points to 801.34.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq Composite rose 18.13 points to 1260.76.</p>
