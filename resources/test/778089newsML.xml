<p>Last year's Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek had no trouble putting away this year's runner-up as the 12th-seeded Dutchman scored a 6-3 6-4 victory over Frenchman Cedric Pioline on the opening night of the star-studded ATP Championship on Monday.</p>
<p>Ninth seed Marcelo Rios of Chile secured a 6-3 7-5 victory over Jonas Bjorkman of Sweden in another first round match on a day that saw one seeded player fall by the wayside.</p>
<p>In a minor upset, Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev ousted promising 15th-seeded Briton Tim Henman 6-3 6-3.</p>
<p>The ATP Championship features the most formidable field in a non-Grand Slam event on the ATP Tour this year. Nine of the top 10 players in the world, led by world number one Pete Sampras, are competing. Only ninth-ranked Carlos Moya of Spain is missing from the world's elite.</p>
<p>The top eight seeds all received first round byes, but Tuesday's schedule features a highly anticipated first-round matchup with French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil taking on former number one Andre Agassi, who has been mostly missing in action this year.</p>
<p>Kuerten, who reached the Canadian Open final Sunday, will make his debut as a top-10 player after becoming the first Brazilian to crack the top-10 with Monday's rankings.</p>
<p>The 15th-ranked Krajicek knew that his match against Pioline might be easier than expected. Following his surprising run to the Wimbledon final, Pioline has been slowed by an arm injury.</p>
<p>"On paper, it was a very tough match to be a seeded player playing a guy ranked in the top 20 who just came off an important final," Krajicek said. "But I knew he was a little injured in the arm."</p>
<p>Krajicek converted five of 10 break chances against Pioline -- in the third and ninth games of the first set and the second, fourth and 10th games of the second set.</p>
<p>Both the 11th-ranked Rios and number 25 Bjorkman had difficulties from the service line.</p>
<p>Rios managed to put just 46 percent of his first serves in play, while Bjorkman posted a dismal 34 percent first serve percentage.</p>
<p>The Swede also suffered eight double faults, including three in the second game of the match.</p>
<p>"That was probably the worst percentage I have had in a match, I think," Bjorkman said. "It was just one of those days. No excuses, I just had the wrong rhythm the whole match. I never found the way to get back in it."</p>
<p>The frequently surly Rios, who trailed Bjorkman 4-1 in the second set before winning six of the last seven games, refused to concede that his serve was off.</p>
<p>"I think I didn't serve bad," he insisted. "I think I played pretty solid and when I had to serve good, I served really good."</p>
