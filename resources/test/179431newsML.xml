<p>Phelps Dodge Corp and United Steelworkers of America union failed to resolve their labor talks deadlock despite a further round of discussions Friday, the company said.</p>
<p>"The Chino talks ended Friday evening and there has been no resolution," said Phelps spokeswoman Sue Suver.</p>
<p>Unionized employees at the 170,000-tonne-per-year contained copper mine in New Mexico have been working without a contract since June 30.</p>
<p>Suver said that on Friday the union sought a six-year contract, with a pay hike in the fifth and sixth year.  </p>
<p>Union officials were not immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Phelps rejected the union's proposal and said its four-year pay-freeze offer made at the end of August was final, Suver said.</p>
<p>"The company is standing behind its final offer," Suver said. "We have suggested to the union we would like a response to the offer we put on the table on August 22, and there have been no dates, either deadlines nor a date to resume discussions. We are waiting for the union to respond."</p>
<p>Suver said Chino was working at "100 percent production".</p>
<p>Earlier Monday, Phelps said a week-long strike at its Candelaria mine in Chile was over with little production disrupted.</p>
