<p>Spot bulk electricity prices in the Mid-Atlantic U.S. dropped Thursday, continuing a recent decline with natural gas on forecast of mild temperatures in the region through this weekend.</p>
<p>"Mild weather, and gas came off hard. Load was predicted to be low for Friday," said an East Coast broker.</p>
<p>The latest forecast indicated Friday's temperatures would climb four to seven degrees Fahrenheit above normal with readings mostly in the 30s-40s. Then, temperatures would rise further at eight to 12 degrees above seasonal norm Sunday. But readings would turn sharply lower Monday at six to 10 degrees below normal.</p>
<p>NYMEX February Henry Hub natgas futures were last down 34.5 cents at $3.421 per million British thermal units.</p>
<p>Friday electricity for firm, peak delivery in the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnect pool plummeted to $17.50-$18.50 a megawatt hour (MWh), down from Tuesday's day-ahead prices at $18.50-$20.00.</p>
<p>There was almost no bulk power trading Wednesday due to the Christmas holiday.</p>
<p>Firm, off-peak PJM power for Friday delivery held steady at $14.00-$15.00.</p>
<p>January 1997 PJM electricity with similar delivery terms were discussed at $30.20-$30.50.</p>
<p>PJM power deliveries for January and February slipped to $29.75-$30.00 from Tuesday's $30.35-$30.65.</p>
<p>March PJM electricity fell 25 cents to $25.00-$25.25 from Tuesday's $25.25-$25.50.</p>
<p>First-quarter PJM deliveries were talked at $28.30-$28.50, and second-quarter quotes were assessed at $23.20-$23.40, a slightly tighter range than Tuesday's $23.15-$23.50.</p>
<p>July/August PJM prices were pegged at $31.70-$31.90, down from Tuesday's $31.80-$32.10.</p>
<p>Third-quarter PJM power were still valued at 29.00-$29.25, fourth-quarter 1997 $24.00-$24.50 and calendar 1997 for peak hour delivery $26.40-$26.70.</p>
<p>PECO Energy said its 1,055 megawatt (MW) Limerick unit 2 returned on line today after its restart was interrupted Wednesday due to a turbine vibration problem.</p>
