<p>Bangladesh begins enforcing a new law on Sunday in a bid to recover huge amounts of defaulted bank loans, estimated at over 150 billion taka ($3.4 billion), central bank officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>"The bankruptcy act will come into force on Sunday. Rules have been formulated. We hope the law will sharpen the teeth of the banks to deal with defaulters," central bank Executive Director Abdur Raquib told Reuters.</p>
<p>Central bank officials said initially four special courts, two in the capital Dhaka and two in the port city of Chittagong, would function to deal with default cases under the law.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy courts will be set up in other major cities in phases.</p>
<p>The law, approved by parliament in March, empowers creditor banks to seek court orders to attach the property of borrowers in default to recover debts.</p>
<p>"Loopholes in the previous Financial Loan Court law have been plugged in the new law," one official said.</p>
<p>The central bank has asked private banks also to list their directors who had defaulted on credit and serve notice on them immediately to pay back their loans.</p>
<p>Some 20 directors of different private banks have already been served notice while the central bank is scrutinising a second list of another 30 bank directors who defaulted on loans.</p>
<p>"If they (directors) fail to pay back loans they will lose their position and their shares (in the bank) would be attached. We want to end the menace of insider lending at banks," said one central bank official.</p>
<p>Some 60 shareholder directors of different private banks were holding about one billion taka in overdue loans.</p>
<p>Large-scale loan defaults have caused severe liquidity problems for banks and squeezed their ability to provide loans for industrial ventures.</p>
<p>The government last week decided to urgently raise 10 billion taka ($227 million) through a new bond to replace bank funding in industry.</p>
<p>Central bank officials said they would start selling the Industrial Bond to the general public in a month.</p>
<p>Officials said the tax authorities would not question the source of the funds to be invested in the bond.</p>
<p>"We have decided to keep eyes close on the source of the investment. We badly need to raise funds for industrialisation," said one Finance Ministry officials.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is also discussing at least $500 million in loans to private industrial entrepreneurs with multilateral financial institutions, including the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.</p>
