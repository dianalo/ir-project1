<p>European oil swaps were little changed after early gains were mostly reversed by weaker afternoon discussions.</p>
<p>The crack spread between gas oil and Brent which held at $5.65 a barrel for the first quarter next year this morning eased a five cents lower during the afternoon as gasoil futures ran out of steam.</p>
<p>"The cracks definitely came off late in the afternoon. All the brokers were looking for the bid," said a trader.</p>
<p>The subsequent quarters next year were $4.45, $4.70 and $5.05 respectively.</p>
<p>Swaps for physical 0.2 percent sulphur were little changed all day, holding around $5.50 a tonne above the IPE on November, $6.50 for December and $7.75 on the first quarter next year.</p>
<p>Jet continued weak, dipping another $1.00 a tonne after losing ground late last Friday, particularly on prompter periods.</p>
<p>November talked either side of $31.00 a tonne above the IPE while December was around $35.50. The first quarter next year talked no higher than $40.00 but the second was about $29.00 above the IPE.</p>
<p>The nearby backwardation on Brent crude CFDs deepened sharply as this weeks dates jumped 10 cents a barrel but next week fell five cents. This week's dates trading at flat to November or the equivalent of 55 cents over December and at 53 cents above December.</p>
<p>Wet Brent slipped slightly, trading in the range 5 to 11 cents over november compared to trade 11 cents on Friday.</p>
<p>Gasoline lost early gains of $2.00 a tonne but activity was thin with just a couple of outright swaps traded and a few inter-month spreads. November was pegged around $230.50 a tonne by the close with the subsequent months as follows: Dec $212.00, Jan $209.00, Feb $210.00, Mar $213.00, Apr $216.50.</p>
<p>Fuel swaps edged up $1.00 a tonne but ended belows the morning highs. November barges traded at $124.75 but then eased to trade at $124.50 and later $124.00. Low sulphur was quiet but pegged around $129.00 for november by the close.</p>
