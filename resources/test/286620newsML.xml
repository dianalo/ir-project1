<p>Notorious opium warlord Khun Sa has built a fast-growing business empire in Burma a year after he surrendered to the government, sources said on Friday.</p>
<p>Khun Sa was leader of a defunct 20,000-strong Mong Tai Army (MTA) that previously sought automony for Burma's eastern Shan State. International drug agencies accused him of using the army as a personal guerrilla force to protect his heroin business.</p>
<p>Sources close to Khun Sa, who surrendered to Burmese troops in January 1996, said he had since led what they called a life of luxury in Rangoon, where he oversaw his diverse business in hotels, beach resorts and highway construction.</p>
<p>"He is doing well and busy making business trips between Rangoon, Mandalay, Taunggyi...," said a former MTA officer now running a teashop in Tachilek on the Thai border and a casino at Kentung in eastern Burma.</p>
<p>He told Reuters by phone that Khun Sa had invested in a hotel in Rangoon, a Burmese beach resort and a transport business in northern Burma.</p>
<p>"He has a hotel in Rangoon and on a beach. He also has won a transport service concession serving Mogok and Mandalay and in the northern part of the country," said the former Khun Sa aide. He declined to estimate the worth of the former warlord's business interests.</p>
<p>A Burmese government spokesman in October denied reports that Khun Sa had undertaken business in Rangoon, but close aides of the former MTA chief said he operated businesses under aliases.</p>
<p>Khun Sa, 62, is an ethnic Chinese Shan who portrayed himself as a freedom fighter for more than two decades.</p>
<p>The United States and anti-narcotics agencies have accused him of using the MTA as a front for drug trafficking.</p>
<p>The Shan state makes up a major part of the Golden Triangle that produces most of the world's opium and heroin. The triangle straddles border areas of Laos, Thailand and Burma.</p>
<p>The U.S. Drugs Enforcement Administration (DEA) has estimated that 70 percent of heroin originates in the Golden Triangle.</p>
<p>Khun Sa was indicted in absentia by a U.S. court in December 1989 on various heroin trafficking charges. Washington has offered a $2 million reward for his arrest and, since his surrender, has called on Rangoon to hand him over for trial in the United States.</p>
<p>Rangoon has turned down the U.S. request.</p>
<p>Khun Sa has denied the U.S. charges but admitted that he had taxed opium traders operating in his formerly controlled area in the Golden Triangle.</p>
<p>Khun Sa's former rivals in the drugs business, the United Wa State Army (UWSA), also claim to have diversified interests.</p>
<p>"We're also in hotel business in Kentung and in transport service in eastern Burma. Since his (Khun Sa's) surrender, we do not regard him as enemy or friend. We do our business and he does his. As far as business does not overlap, we have no problems with each other," an UWSA official said.</p>
<p>The senior UWSA officer said Khun Sa may also have invested in the construction sector. "I have learned that Khun Sa won a concession to build a Burmese highway but I do not have details," he told Reuters.</p>
<p>UWSA is a splinter group of the outlawed Burmese Communist Party.</p>
