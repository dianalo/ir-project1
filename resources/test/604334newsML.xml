<p>Citing conflicting court decisions, New York Gov George Pataki on Thursday directed the state tax agency to repeal laws for collecting taxes on gasoline and cigarettes sold on Indians reservations.</p>
<p>Further, the Republican governor said he sent a bill to the legislature that would let stores on Native American reservations sell tax-free gasoline and cigarettes.  </p>
<p>Pataki's hand was forced last year when a state supreme court ruled in favor of a group of about 3,000 convienence stores, who argued that the reservations' tax-free status gave them an unfair advantage. Judge Joseph Harris held that the taxes must be collected on all retailers or on none.</p>
<p>In March, Pataki reached interim pacts with six nations that required five of the tribes to raise cigarette prices as a first step in getting "an acceptable level of parity," while the sixth said it would do the same for gasoline.</p>
<p>However, State Supreme Court Judge Rose Sconiers of the Western District recently ruled the state went too far when it blocked supplies from reaching the Seneca tribe. The Senecas, who had not signed an interim pact, had had to stop selling gasoline and cigarettes. The state sought a stay of the judge's decision, and a higher court set a mid-June hearing.</p>
<p>Saying he worked over two-and-a-half years to solve the problem, Pataki, in prepared remarks, said: "These steps will allow the Indian Nations to manage these enterprises on their own, as they have done for decades. Let me make my message to all Indian Nations clear: It is your land, we respect your sovreignty and, if the legislature acts as I am requesting, you will have the right to sell tax-free gasoline and cigarettes free from interference from New York State."</p>
<p>Pataki's new policy infuriated the Independent Petroluem Marketers of New York, which had brought suit. "I just don't understand why, when you're this close to resolving an issue, you'd walk away like this," said Bob Reid, the group's executive director. He added it had not yet decided whether to takes its fight back to the courts.</p>
<p>The issue has been highly controversial and a recent rally outside Buffalo on the part of the state Thruway that runs through the Cattaraugus reservation turned violent, and 12 state troopers were injured.</p>
