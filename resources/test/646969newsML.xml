<p>The chairman of the House tax-writing committee on Monday unveiled legislation to give Americans their first major tax cuts since 1981 and ran straight into Democratic and White House opposition.</p>
<p>While his position as chairman of the influential House Ways and Means Committee Chairman gives Representative Bill Archer's plan political advantage, much wrangling is expected in the coming month over the $85 billion five-year tax cut.</p>
<p>Archer's tax bill aimed to detail the tax part of the agreement to balance the budget over five years reached last month between congressional leaders and President Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>"Tax relief and a balanced budget are on the way for the American people," said Archer, a Texas Republican, at a press conference.</p>
<p>The bill offers tax relief for higher education, children, investments, and estates. It would cut individual income taxes by a net $19.7 billion in 1998.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said the Clinton administration had "serious concerns with significant parts" of Archer's bill and that it fell short of fulfilling a pledge to provide $35 billion for education tax credits.</p>
<p>The most costly piece of the five-year tax package was a permanent tax credit for children under age 17 that would be $400 in fiscal 1998 and $500 after that. The cost over five years of that proposal would be $71 billion and it was expected to cover 41 million children.</p>
<p>Rubin said he liked the "substantial" child tax credit but opposed the fact it would computed after the earned income tax credit for the working poor. "That would adversely affect a lot of relatively poor or low-income working people," he said.</p>
<p>Rubin said Archer's construction of education initiatives, worth $31 billion through 2002, such as the HOPE scholarship to provide tax credits for college would "tend to disadvantage the less-well-off in our society."</p>
<p>Archer's proposal would give a 50 percent tax credit for higher education expenses of up to $3,000, while the president had proposed a straight $1,500 tax credit.</p>
<p>Republicans for years have wanted to cut the capital gains tax and see this year's push to enact major tax legislation as a key opportunity to accomplish their goal.</p>
<p>Under Archer's plan, the maximum capital gains tax rate for individuals would be cut to 20 percent from the current 28 percent. The capital gains tax provision would take account of inflation for stocks and other assets bought by individuals starting Jan. 1, 2001.</p>
<p>The indexing for inflation "is the piece of capital gains that we are most troubled about," Rubin said, in part because of its potential long-term loss of government revenue.</p>
<p>For corporations, the capital gains tax rate would be reduced gradually from a maximum 35 percent to 30 percent in 2000 for assets held more than five years.</p>
<p>"With the recent stock market boom, an increasing number of middle-class Americans are benefiting from the rising value of their stocks and mutual funds," Archer said. The effective date for the capital gains tax cut would be May 7, 1997.</p>
<p>Profits made from selling homes of up to $500,000 for married couples would be excluded from the capital gains tax.</p>
<p>Archer's bill would also create an "American Dream" savings account, a non-deductible modified Individual Retirement Account, in which earnings could be withdrawn tax-free.</p>
<p>Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth is currently working on his own tax bill. The Delaware Republican, said: "I know how difficult it is to balance the competing interests within a limited tax bill, and I think that he (Archer) did a fine job."</p>
<p>Archer's tax bill would also phase in an increase of the threshold at which the estate tax kicks in to eventually reach $1 million from the current $600,000. Proponents have said this will help farmers and small business owners who wish to pass on their businesses to their children.</p>
<p>Democrats that Archer will have to deal with on his committee criticised the plan. Representative Charles Rangel of New York who is the ranking Democrat on House Ways and Means said: "He's just pushed this envelope so far to the right."</p>
<p>Rangel said after seeing the bill he was not sure any of the Democrats would vote for it if the president opposed it.</p>
<p>Archer's package included about $47 billion in revenue increases over five years from airline ticket taxes, departure fees and ethanol tax credit reduction. Also Archer proposed imposing a federal tax on income earned by Indian tribes from commercial activities including gaming.</p>
