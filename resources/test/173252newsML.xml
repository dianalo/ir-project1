<title>SWITZERLAND: Swiss bond market closing report.</title>
<headline>Swiss bond market closing report.</headline>
<dateline>ZURICH 1996-11-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>Swiss bonds closed firm, but just off highs, with the market losing steam after the Swiss franc reversed some early gains.</p>
<p>Traders said the market lacked conviction despite its firmer tone and some were watching the German Bund contract to see if it could maintain levels above 100.00.</p>
<p>"The Bund is crucial. If it goes under 100 then we will see a sellout in our markets," said one chief dealer at a large Swiss bank. The cash Conf/Bund spread remained relatively narrow below 200 basis points  YLDS3. Traders said prices were helped by short-covering, with some even seeing a mild squeeze.  </p>
<p>The market was mainly watching the Swiss franc, which recovered against the dollar and mark. Traders expected any further declines in the currency to push prices lower again.</p>
<p>The dollar rose to 1.2850 francs on Wednesday, its highest levels since February 1995, and the mark rose to 84.32 centimes, its highest levels since March 1995.</p>
<p>The dollar ended Thursday at 1.2710, and the mark at 84.08.</p>
<p>The Swiss National Bank (SNB), as expected, left its discount rate unchanged at 1.00 percent at its weekly meeting.</p>
<p>SNB chairman Hans Meyer is due to speak this evening in Olten, Switzerland at 1800 GMT.  </p>
