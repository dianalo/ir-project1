<p>Pakistan recognised the Taleban Islamic movement's government in neighbouring Afghanistan on Sunday, becoming the first country to do so.</p>
<p>"I am happy to announce that the government of Pakistan has now decided to accord formal recognition to the new government of the Islamic State of Afghanistan," Pakistan Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan told a news conference which followed the purist Islamic movement's sweeping military gains in the north..  </p>
<p>Pakistan had previously withheld the recognition "to give time for the promotion of a broad-based government" in the war-shattered country through peaceful negotiations, Khan said.</p>
<p>"We feel that the new government fulfils all criteria for de jure recognition," he said. "It is now in effective control of most of the territory of Afghanistan and is representative of all ethnic groups in that country."</p>
<p>He said Pakistan looked forward to "a meaningful and cooperative relationship" with the government and people of Afghanistan in the interest of peace and security in the region.</p>
