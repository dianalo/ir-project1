<p>First polls closed in the U.S. election on Tuesday and there were some early signs that the race between President Bill Clinton and Republican challenger Bob Dole could be closer than anticipated.</p>
<p>In Kentucky and Indiana, the two states where the polls closed first, the race was too close to call, according to exit polls quoted by CNN.</p>
<p>Indiana is a staunchly Republican state which had not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since 1964. If Clinton won there, he would likely score a decisive victory.</p>
<p>Clinton carried Kentucky in 1992. If Dole won there, he could make the race closer than many had predicted.</p>
<p>Public opinion polls had projected Clinton the election winner by varied margins. The Reuters poll conducted by John Zogby International said the president would win by 7.3 percentage points. CNN said his margin would be 13 points. The New York Times and CBS said Clinton would win by 18 points.</p>
<p>The president, forecast as the victor in all public opinion polls, voted at a polling place in Little Rock, Arkansas, then joined family and friends to await his expected triumph. As night fell, Clinton supporters flowed towards the city centre in a festive mood.</p>
<p>Dole returned to the small town of Russell, Kansas, where he was born 73 years ago and grew up in the grim Dust Bowl years of the Great Depression. Surrounded by relatives and friends, Dole entered the flag-draped First Christian Church to vote on an old-fashioned paper ballot.</p>
<p>"I've voted before here lots ... but never voted for myself for president. I was a little nervous," Dole said after he and his wife, Elizabeth, left the polling booths.</p>
<p>"I guess I think the arguments about the election are over. The choice now rests with the voters of America, and I've never doubted their wisdom," Dole said, his voice cracking with emotion.</p>
<p>Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who took nearly one vote in five in a 1992 presidential bid, was a far weaker force this time around. He was low-key about his prospects when he voted in his home town, Dallas.</p>
<p>"We'll see how it works out," he told reporters. In a $2 million television advertisement on Monday night, Perot kept up a steady drumbeat of criticism of Clinton, charging a second term would bring "Watergate II."</p>
<p>Voters were also choosing 34 senators, 11 state governors and all 435 members of the House of Representatives. Republicans won control of Congress for the first time in 40 years in 1994 and were fighting to maintain their majorities in both houses.</p>
<p>Americans were also voting in ballot initiatives on a bewildering range of topics such as parents' rights in Colorado, clearcut logging in Maine and the future of affirmative action for women and minorities in California.</p>
<p>Many polling stations in major cities reported a brisk turnout during the morning rush hour under reasonably good weather conditions. Clinton was confident enough to dance the popular "Macarena" line dance aboard the presidential aircraft.</p>
<p>In Little Rock, city officials were preparing a huge election-night celebration in anticipation of the Arkansas native son's re-election.</p>
<p>Dole planned to watch election returns in Washington.</p>
<p>Experts were predicting a low turnout among 148 million registered voters. Only 55.2 percent of eligible adults voted in 1992 when Clinton won the presidency.</p>
<p>Most polls close between 7 p.m. EST (Midnight GMT Wednesday) in Eastern states and 11 p.m. EST (0400 GMT) in California. The White House result was expected to be known by mid-evening but control of Congress may not be clear until Wednesday, if then.</p>
