<p>Norwegian shares traded in negative terroritory on Friday as Thorbjoern Jagland's new government took office.</p>
<p>"It was very quiet for most of the day but some activity took place towards the end of the session and driving up volume a bit," one trader said.</p>
<p>The Total share index fell 0.39 percent to 872.93 points in moderate turnover of 637 million crowns, including 111 million crowns traded in industrial giant Norsk Hydro, which finished marginally lower at 297.50 crowns.</p>
<p>The market took note of a statement late in the day by Jagland that the government may reduce its controlling stake in the country's top commercial banks to below 50 percent.</p>
<p>One broker said the remark at Jagland's first news conference after taking office could prove positive for the banking sector and the market in general.</p>
<p>"Maybe Jagland is not such a left-winger after all," the broker said.</p>
