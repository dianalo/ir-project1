<p>Bundesbank President Hans Tietmeyer was quoted on Wednesday as saying current interest rate levels were not an obstacle to economic growth or jobs, but that he would not rule out further cuts.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer told the mass-circulation Bild newspaper, according to an advance release from Wednesday morning's edition, that it was important to note that interest rates were already at an "historic low".  </p>
<p>Tietmeyer said the Bundesbank's stability-oriented policies were not to blame for Germany's current high unemployment -- which leapt by over half a million last month to a post-war record 4.66 million.</p>
<p>"Without the Bundesbank's stability course, we would be in far greater difficulties," he was quoted as saying.</p>
<p>"Our policy of stability has given the German economy very low interest rates and so has created favourable investment conditions. Therefore we will maintain our course," he said.</p>
<p>Tietmeyer added that this was also a good contribution to the start of the single European currency, which Germany argued must be at least as stable as the mark.</p>
