<p>The Slovak trade deficit narrowed, year-on-year, over the first two months, but analysts said the data are in-line with forecasts and that several large investment projects would spur the deficit later in the year.</p>
<p>The statistical bureau (SUSR) on Tuesday said the trade deficit totalled 10.821 billion crowns for the January-February period, down from 13.193 billion for the same period last year.</p>
<p>SUSR said the figure was helped by a rapid reduction of imports coupled with an increase of exports.</p>
<p>But analysts said the changing dynamics were expected, and that the full year trade deficit would be near or just under the 1996 shortfall of 64.54 billion crowns.</p>
<p>"We expected the deficit to slow down this year, both due to growth of exports and the reduction of imports, so the figure is in line with our forecasts," Vladimir Kuklis of bank CSOB told Reuters.</p>
<p>"Our exports are closely linked to western Europe, which is generally expected to grow economically in the coming months... on the other hand, the administrative reduction of consumer imports also seems to have played its role," he added.</p>
<p>Auto imports fell 12.1 percent, year-on-year, after the government re-installed a 17.5 percent duty on imports of new cars with engines of 1,500cc from the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>SUSR said exports totalled 45.373 billion crowns, an increase of 13.1 percent over January-February 1996, which compares with a 0.9 percent year-on-year rise in January 1997.</p>
<p>Imports, led by a 19.9 percent rise fossil fuels and mineral oils, rose by 5.4 percent year-on-year in the first two months of 1997, totalling 56.193 billion crowns, compared with a 22.3 percent year-on-year growth in January.</p>
<p>Technological imports for upgrading of the ageing Jaslovske Bohunice nuclear power plant and the completion of the Mochovce nuclear power plant also figured heavily into the deficit.</p>
<p>Martin Barto, analyst at ING Barings, said the lower deficit was a positive signal, but that it was too early to celebrate the figure as the first sign of a longer-term trend.</p>
<p>"Several large investment projects scheduled for this year -- such as those of oil refiner Slovnaft, electricity producer Slovenske Elektrarne or for the telecommunications network, will require purchase of foreign technologies and this will significantly influence imports," Barto said.</p>
<p>"On the other hand, expected growth in western countries, mainly Germany, should help boost our exports, so the deficit could be at around last year's level," he added.</p>
<p>Iron and rolled steel were the most important export, rising 6.1 percent year-on-year, while the fastest rising item on export side was automobiles, which were up 109.6 percent against January-February period of 1996.</p>
<p>The Czech Republic remained Slovakia's main trading partner, accounting for 27.5 percent of exports and 23.2 percent of imports. Exports to Germany accounted for 26 percent, followed by Austria and Italy, with 6.1 and 5.4 percent, respectively.</p>
