<p>Belgian broker Vermeulen Raemdonck downgraded polyeureuthane foam products maker Recticel to 'hold' from 'speculative buy' on Monday in view of the share's strong performance over the past three months.</p>
<p>"Based on a slightly better EBIT and lower financial charges than we previously thought, we now expect EPS 97E at 22 Bfr (19 Bfr) and EPS 98E at 29 Bfr (23 Bfr)," it said.</p>
<p>"However, after the strong performance of the share since our speculative BUY recommendation on March 12 (at 404 Bfr), we downgrade our recommendation to HOLD," the broker added in its weekly market commentary.</p>
<p>The downgrading followed a meeting with analysts at the company last week.</p>
<p>At 0930 the share was down 0.4 percent at 470 francs.</p>
