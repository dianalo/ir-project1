<p>Portuguese financial markets are anticipating a cut of 20 to 30 basis points in the Bank of Portugal's repo rate on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>They said that if the Bank opted to cut the repo, currently 6.5 percent, by 50 basis points then this would lift the short end of the yield curve, so steepening it.</p>
<p>"The markets have already discounted a cut of up to 30 basis points (in the repo), which, if it happens, will consolidate the recent steepening of the curve," said analyst Martim Amaral Neto Banco ESSI.</p>
<p>"We expect 25 basis points and with a cut of 25 or 30 basis points, the spread between the two and the 10 year bonds will widen by up to eight basis points," said Nuno Godinho of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>On the secondary market, the yield spread between the March 1999 and February 2007 stands at 105 basis points against 75 at the start of April.</p>
<p>Traders said that the escudo was unlikely to be hurt even if the Bank opted for a more aggressive approach and cut by 50 basis points. But the currency could suffer if the Bank made no rate change, as this could be interpreted as a negative signal and unsettle the markets, they said.</p>
<p>Nine out of 10 analysts polled by Reuters said on Thursday that they expected a cut in rates, with up to 30 basis points coming off the repo rate, 20 to 50 basis points off the drain rate -- currently 6.2 percent -- and 20 to 75 basis points off the 8.3 percent emergency lending rate.</p>
<p>"The Bank should cut because (foreign) markets have been calmer since last week," said Pedro Azevedo head of treasury at Banco Mello de Investimento.</p>
<p>"This week we had a very good number for inflation," he added, referring to the year-on-year rate in March which dipped to 2.5 percent from 2.9 percent in February. "In April, it (inflation) could go below two percent," he added.</p>
<p>For Ana Paula Carvalho of Banco Portugues de Investimento, two questions restraining the Bank from cutting rates before -- uncertainty over inflation and the escudo -- had both been resolved.</p>
<p>The escudo was trading around three month highs against the mark on Thursday, looking to break 100 to the German currency.</p>
<p>Money market rates have been easing for the past 10 days, with very short-term rates below the central bank's drain rate.</p>
<p>June Forward Rate Agreements (FRA) stood at 5.62/5.67 percent against a three-month Lisbor of 6.0075 percent, a clear signal that the market sees lower official rates, analysts said.</p>
<p>"The market seems to have discounted lower rates and even with a cut tomorrow, the expectation will be for more cuts in the future," said analyst Isabel Costa of Banco Finantia.</p>
<p>Some analysts said that the FRA market was being conservative and that the central bank would need to cut interest rates even more aggressively in the future.</p>
