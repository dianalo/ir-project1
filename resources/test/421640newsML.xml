<headline>Cobalt under pressure despite Zaire woes, eyes DLA.</headline>

<p>Cobalt held softer levels during early European trading on Wednesday as the market still remained broadly divorced from the fighting between government troops and rebels in mineral-rich Zaire.</p>
<p>European traders said most of their attention focused on a U.S.DLA sale. The market is often pressured lower by traders around the time of DLA sales, they explained.</p>
<p>"The market is trending lower but is unlikely to make any significant moves until the result of the sale is known," one London- based trader said.</p>
<p>The Defense National Stockpile will announce the outcome of its sale of 1.1 million pounds of cobalt, offered on a negotiated bid basis, by mid-March.</p>
<p>The deadline for the bidding was February 20.</p>
<p>Traders suggested the quality of the material on offer was lower than usual, below 90 percent cobalt. On Wednesday the stockpile invited bids on a sealed basis for one million pounds of higher grade metals, 93 to 96 percent cobalt.</p>
<p>War news included a Defence Ministry official in Zaire's capital Kinshasa saying the rebels had gained more ground in the cobalt and copper producing region of Shaba and had overrun the town of Kabalo.</p>
<p>Kabalo is on the main railway line serving Shaba and around 500 km from the provincial capital of Lubumbashi, the centre of Zaire's cobalt and copper industry.</p>
<p>European cobalt traders said news from war-torn Zaire was slow to emerge.</p>
<p>Several said production remained at near normal levels, while others said that output had ceased completely.</p>
<p>"It's take your pick which side of the coin you choose at the moment...most of the news surrounding Shaba is unclear and distorted," one trader commented.</p>
<p>But most agreed that Zaire's cloudy production figures had been factored into current price gyrations.</p>
<p>Zaire produces many grades of cobalt.</p>
<p>According to industry specialists Chempro/Sassoon Zaire's 1997 output will drop to 1,500 tonnes. In 1996 production was 3,700 tonnes, above 831 tonnes seen in 1993 but well down on the dizzy heights of 14,478 tonnes in 1986, based on Cobalt Development Institute statistics.</p>
<p>Lack of investment in old and new facilities and infrastructure surrounding the mineral-rich Shaba region are seen as the main contributory factors to the decline in cobalt production from the 1986 peaks.</p>
<p>"Production has levelled off and will not recover significantly unless large amounts of money are poured into the region," one trader said.</p>
<p>"It's an obvious comment but no one is likely to invest in a country that is being torn apart by political chaos," said a European trader, adding that this suggests production from Zaire will remain low in the long-term.</p>
<p>High grade cobalt was indicated at around $19.50 a Ib, though several traders suggested lower levels could be achieved.</p>
<p>This was down on the November 1996 peaks of between $24 and $25.</p>
<p>Russian material was also lower at about $17.50, against $21/$22, also basis late November 1996.</p>
