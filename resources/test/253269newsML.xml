<p>The White House on Wednesday said President Bill Clinton was satisfied that Anthony Lake, his choice for CIA director, made an innocent mistake in not complying with an order to sell stocks to avoid a conflict of interest.</p>
<p>CBS News reported Lake, currently White House national security adviser, was questioned last week by the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section about his apparent inadvertent failure to sell off more than $200,000 of energy stocks.</p>
<p>White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry said that when Lake filed a financial disclosure statement with the White House in 1993, it was determined that some energy stocks he owned posed a potential conflict of interest.</p>
<p>He said Lake agreed to comply with the finding and "passed on information to instruct his accountant to sell those stocks but ... apparently that wasn't carried out."</p>
<p>When Lake filed his financial disclosure statement for 1994, the White House legal counsel's office discovered that he still owned the stocks.</p>
<p>In May of 1995, when Lake was notified of the problem, "he sold them immediately," McCurry said, noting that "the law requires us to bring to the Justice Department's attention anything related to a compliance issue."</p>
<p>McCurry stressed that Clinton had been fully aware of the situation and that he felt it should not be a factor in Senate confirmation of Lake as CIA director.</p>
<p>"We went ahead with this nomination knowing all the facts related to this situation because Tony Lake is exceptionally well qualified and he is known to the president and everyone in the White House as being someone of impeccable reputation," McCurry said.</p>
