<title>TAIWAN: Taiwan liberalising stock market entry in WTO move.</title>

<p>A joint committee of parliament has proposed revising the Securities Trading Law to allow new stock exchanges in a liberalisation to improve Taiwan's chances of entering the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p>Taiwan has one bourse, the huge Taiwan Stock Exchange, as well as a fledgling over-the-counter market.</p>
<p>The draft revision would allow the establishment of rival stock markets, the watchdog Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement issued on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The draft also would let foreigners join local exchanges as shareholders and work as brokers in securities brokerages.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Paul Chiu, quoted in several newspapers, said there were no applications pending to open any exchanges, confirming that the reform move had more to do with entry to the World Trade Organisation than with market demand.</p>
<p>The WTO's principles on market openness require that members allow multiple competitive securities exchanges to ensure transparency and high market liquidity.</p>
<p>The revision must be approved by the full parliament before it can become law.</p>
