<p>The U.S. Senate Energy Committee said Monday it was set to vote Wednesday on the nomination of Federico Pena to be Energy Secretary.</p>
<p>The committee is expected to approve the nomination, according to Energy Department officials.</p>
<p>Assuming it is approved, the full Senate could vote on it before the end of this week, according to Senate aides.</p>
<p>The committee is also set to vote Wednesday on a bill that could force the Clinton administration to build a temporary storage facility in Nevada for spent fuel from commercial nuclear reactors.</p>
<p>A similar bill was approved by the committee last year and was passed by the Senate by a vote of 63-37.</p>
<p>Undersecretary of Energy Thomas Grumbly reiterated last week that President Bill Clinton would veto the bill if it was passed without major changes.</p>
