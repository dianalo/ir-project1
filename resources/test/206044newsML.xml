<p>A cheaper air cargo service to Russia and the former Soviet Union via Prague is being marketed by UK cargo general sales agent Air Marketing Associations (AMA).</p>
<p>"It is really a matter of educating the marketplace that there is more than one option for Russia and the FSU," AMA managing director Len Bunn said.</p>
<p>The indirect flights offer significant cost savings which will vary depending on destination and at most an extra day might be involved, an AMA spokesman said.</p>
<p>"We have recently lost freight capacity on Aeroflot from the UK, which has placed considerable pressures on capacity into the whole region at the time of year when agents need it most. Also, the steady underlying growth in the market is generating some traffic which requires more competitive rating."</p>
<p>"These factors drove our decision to offer coverage on Czech Airlines (CSA), in addition to the LOT-Polish Airlines based transhipment services which we commenced a few weeks ago," he added.</p>
<p>AMA is marketing spare belly space in CSA flights from Heathrow to its Prague hub. It also markets cargohold capacity on direct Aeroflot flights to Russia. AMA is cargo UK GSA for all three carriers. LOT flies from Heathrow and Aeroflot from Gatwick and Manchester.</p>
<p>Bunn said a new CSA tariff to the FSU is now being prepared and will reflect the fact that the service is indirect. As most of the traffic for the region already tranships at least once service levels would be little different.</p>
<p>CSA and LOT fly Boeing 737s from the UK whilst Aerflot flies a mix of Airbus 310s, Illushin Il-62s and 86s and Tupolev Tu134s and 154s. -- Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+44 171 542 5017</p>
