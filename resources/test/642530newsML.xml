<p>NWE oil products were mostly weaker on Friday, traders said.</p>
<p>Gasoline was sharply weaker as NYMEX gasoline futures broke through technical support. Eurograde barges traded in the afternoon at $196/$197 fob ARA.</p>
<p>Naphtha was slightly weaker with crude, but an industry function stifled business.</p>
<p>Gas oil eased on softer benchmark IPE futures. Heating oil barges were done at June IPE +75 cents fob ARA for storage material for second half delivery.</p>
