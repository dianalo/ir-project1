<p>Chrysler Corp. said Tuesday it would make 180,000 minivans that can run on either gasoline or ethanol, the second major automaker in a week to unveil a large-scale alternative fuel vehicle programme.</p>
<p>The Chrysler announcement drew a stinging rebuke from environmentalists, who accused automakers of exploiting federal alternative fuel credits in order to sell more gas-guzzling -- but highly profitable -- pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles.</p>
<p>"This is a new low for the Big Three. They should be ashamed of themselves," said Dan Becker, director of the global warming and energy programme for the Sierra Club.</p>
<p>In a news briefing at the Governors' Ethanol Coalition Conference, Chrysler officials said vehicles will be available starting in the 1998 model year, which begins this autumn.</p>
<p>Ford Motor Co. said last week it plans to produce 250,000 flexible-fuel pickup trucks, sedans and minivans starting in the 1998 for the 1999 model year. Ford plans to spend about $300 per vehicle so they can run on gasoline or a mixture of gasoline and ethanol, alcohol made from corn and grains that burns cleaner than gasoline but is less fuel-efficient.</p>
<p>General Motors Corp., the world's largest automaker, offers a limited number of alternative fuel vehicles but has not announced a large-scale production programme.</p>
<p>The Chrysler official would not comment on how much it will cost the nation's third largest automaker to adapt the flexible-fuel technology, but he said it will not affect the retail price of the minivans.</p>
<p>Chrysler said flexible-fuel minivans that run on E85 -- a combination of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline -- will get about 33 percent fewer miles per gallon than minivans that run on gasoline.</p>
<p>All of Chrysler's 1998 Plymouth Voyager, Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town and Country minivans that come with the standard 3.3-litre, six-cylinder engine will be able to run on either fuel. Chrysler will manufacture the vehicles at its assembly plants in Windsor, Ontario, and in Fenton, Mo.</p>
<p>Bill Rotramel, a Chrysler spokesman, said that in addition to helping the environent, flexible-fuel vehicles helped lower U.S. dependence on oil imports.</p>
<p>Members of the National Corn Growers Association and officials from corn-growing states welcomed Chrysler's move.</p>
<p>"If 250,000 of these vehicles used as little as 100 gallons each year of E85, that would produce a market for 25 million gallons of ethanol or about 10 million bushels of corn," association Vice President Ryland Utlaut said.</p>
<p>Chrysler officials said little about the federal fuel credits automakers receive for offering flexible-fuel vehicles. Such credits allow automakers to raise their corporate average fuel economy, or CAFE.</p>
<p>That, in turn, allows automakers sell a higher number of less-efficient pickups and sport utility vehicles. The federal government sets CAFE limits to force automakers to offer a certain number of fuel-efficient vehicles.</p>
<p>Rotramel said Chrysler will benefit from the credits obtained from the ethanol programme, but he declined to give the number of CAFE credits Chrysler will get for each one sold.</p>
<p>The Sierra Club's Becker said Ford and Chrysler will be able to sell two additional light trucks for every flexible fuel vehicle. Because there are only about 40 service stations in the country that offer E85 to the public, he questioned how many Chrysler minivans will actually burn E85.</p>
<p>An official with the Department of Energy countered environmentalists' criticisms of Ford and Chrysler's motives.</p>
<p>"It's unfair to criticise the auto companies of taking advantage of a public policy which was designed to promote this very kind of alternative fuel vehicles," said David Rodgers of the department's Office of Transportation Technologies.</p>
<p>Chrysler stock was unchanged at $32.875 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
