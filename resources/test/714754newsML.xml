<p>Asian dollar deposit rates were quietly steady on Tuesday in moderate trade with most traders sidelined ahead of tonight's release of the U.S. May consumer credit data, dealers said.</p>
<p>Consumer credit for May is forecast to be around US$5.6 billion compared with $7.6 billion reported in April.</p>
<p>"Rates were quietly steady in the morning except for some position adjustments. Some traders were waiting for more clues to market direction from tonight's release of the (U.S. May) consumer credit figures," a local dealer said.  </p>
<p>"But I don't think there will be much impact, unless the numbers are way off market expectations," he said.</p>
<p>In day-to-day rates, Tuesday/Wednesday, Wednesday/Thursday and week-fixed were unchanged from Monday's common 5-9/16 5-7/16 percent, respectively.</p>
<p>Among longer dates, two-months was unchanged at 5-11/16 5-9/16 percent, four-months unchanged at 5-3/4 5-5/8, six-months unchanged at 5-7/8 5-3/4 and twelve-months unchanged at 6-1/16 5-15/16 percent.</p>
