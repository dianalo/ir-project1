<p>Cheap exports of subsidised European Union beef are destroying Southern Africa's beef industries, Rob Davies, chairman of the South African parliament's Trade and Industry Committee, said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"EU exports of frozen beef are sold on the South African market at fifty percent below the domestic production price," Davies told a news conference in the European Parliament.</p>
<p>"That in my book is dumping."</p>
<p>Davies said the cut-price EU beef, which attracts export subsidies of six  rand ($1.40) a kilo, on top of production subsidies of 5.5 rand/kg, was displacing local production not only in South Africa but also in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland, with which South Africa is linked in the Southern African Customs Union.</p>
<p>Loss of revenue in South Africa and Namibia alone amounted to more than the total amount of EU aid to these countries, Davies said.</p>
<p>He warned much worse was to come if the EU insisted on demanding a free trade agreement with South Africa under present conditions.</p>
<p>"It is exactly the kind of problem foreseen in opening up the South African market," Davies said.</p>
<p>The EU wants South Africa to allow over 90 percent of EU farm exports to enter the country duty-free and subsidised, but is only prepared to offer duty free access to some 50 percent of South African farm products, Davies said.</p>
<p>Exports to South Africa of subsidised EU beef shot up from 7,000 tonnes in 1993 to 47,000 tonnes in 1996.</p>
<p>British Socialist Euro-MP Glenys Kinnock said the surge in exports could not be disassociated from the crisis in the EU beef market caused by mad cow disease.</p>
<p>"Europe is trying to export the crisis," she said.</p>
<p>Mpho Malie, a member of the Lesotho parliament, told reporters the Southern African states were not opposed to competition as long as it was fair, but they needed 15 years to adapt their industries to a free trade agreement with the EU.</p>
<p>If the region was not allowed to open up its markets more slowly and less extensively than the EU, whole industries could collapse, he warned.</p>
<p>The impact would not only affect farm products like beef, sugar and maize but also textiles, household appliances like TVs and fridges, millers and the food processing industry.</p>
<p>Davies said South Africa would prefer to solve the dispute through bilateral negotiations with the EU.</p>
<p>Taking the more confrontational route of challenging the EU for violating international trade rules, which forbid dumping, would be more difficult but might be necessary if other options failed, he said.</p>
