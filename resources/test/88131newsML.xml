<p>Caracas stocks rose to record highs for the eighth straight session on undiminished foreign investor optimism in the bolsa's prospects, traders said.</p>
<p>The market's 19-share index rose 1.29 percent to close at 5,552.64 points, according to preliminary figures from the stock exchange.</p>
<p>"This is still an optimistic market, with foreign funds continuing to recommend it," said Financorp broker Hector Perez.  On Tuesday, U.S. investment bank Bear Stearns upgraded Venezuela to an overweight rating from neutral in its Latin American Model Portfolio.  </p>
<p>"We don't expect much profit-taking for the moment as investors are taking middle and long term positions," said Perez.</p>
<p>Trade volume was strong, as 22.8 million shares exchanged hands worth some 3.9 billion bolivars ($8.2 million), with brokers singling-out rises in wood-chip and paper manufacturer Venepal VNPa.C -- up 39.00 and 7.25 bolivars respectively to close at 479.00 and 380.00.</p>
<p>"Venepal rose on its proposed two-for-one stock split," said Interacciones broker Freddy Zambrano. The proposal is due to be discussed at an extraordinary meeting on October 17.  </p>
<p>Among the day's other leading trades, Manpa rose 2.15 bolivars to end at 136.00 bolivars. But traders noted that stocks rose generally across the board.</p>
<p>Among traded issues, 33 rose and seven closed flat, while five fell.</p>
