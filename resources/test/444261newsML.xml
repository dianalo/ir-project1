<p>Indonesian tyre-grade SIR20 offer prices were generally stable in late trading on Friday following overnight U.S. buying amid bearish market sentiment, traders said.</p>
<p>"Market sentiment remains bearish and we expect it to continue until next week as demand is still poor," one trader said. He said buyers seemed to be waiting until prices declined further.</p>
<p>Traders said offer prices were quoted at 52.00 U.S. cents/lb fob Palembang for March/April shipment following overnight buying and at 52.50 fob Surabaya after some deals.</p>
