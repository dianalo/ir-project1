<p>Sea Containers Ltd said Tuesday it is forecasting 1997 operating earnings of $160 million, which would translate to earnings per common share of more than double the $1.20 reported for 1996.</p>
<p>The company said it made the forecast in the 1996 annual report being mailed to shareholders starting Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We are targeting a one third increase in our operating profits from leisure activities in 1997 to $40 million from $30 million in 1996, with operating earnings from our passenger transport businesses also reaching the $40 million level," said founder/president James Sherwood in the report.  </p>
<p>"Together they should match our Container Division operating profits which we estimate at approximately $80 million," he said.</p>
<p>In his review of the businesses, Sherwood said the company sees 1997 as a transition year in container leasing, with operating earnings broadly similar to those in 1996. However, he noted that container utilization, which declined to 83 percent in 1996, has recovered to 85 percent with divisional management budgeting a further increase in the second half.</p>
<p>The company said passenger transport activities are expected to show continued growth in revenue and profits in 1997. The Great North Eastern Railway is operating to budget, while the outlook in the ferry operations is improved based on better results in the Scandinavian service, the addition of a SeaCat service to Isle of Man routes and further gains in the English Channel business where Hoverspeed enjoyed a satisfactory year in 1996.</p>
<p>Leisure activities are projected to produce record 1997 profits because of high demand for the company's 16 owned and managed hotels. Enhancements made to existing hotels in 1996 should translate into greatly improved results in 1997 and thereafter.</p>
