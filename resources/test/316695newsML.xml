<p>The head of Ireland's Roman Catholic church urged IRA guerrillas on Saturday to call a halt to an 11-month-old bombing campaign which has brought Northern Ireland to the brink of renewed sectarian warfare.</p>
<p>Archbishop Sean Brady, in a message to be read across the island of Ireland this weekend, urged Irish Republican Army guerrillas to restore a broken truce to earn their Sinn Fein political wing a seat at Belfast peace talks.</p>
<p>"An unequivocal restoration of the ceasefire by the IRA is ....an indispensable precondition for the comprehensive negotiations which are now so urgently needed," he said.</p>
<p>His message was read out hours after police announced the discovery of a high-powered sniper rifle hidden in the stairwell of a block of flats in Catholic West Belfast, an IRA stronghold.</p>
<p>Police chief Ronnie Flanagan said this week that the IRA appeared intent on killing members of the overwhelmingly Protestant Royal Ulster Constabulary police force.</p>
<p>The IRA, which wants to end British rule of Northern Ireland and reunite the province with the Irish republic, ended a 17-month truce in February 1996 and has launched a wave of attacks in Northern Ireland since Christmas.</p>
<p>"I call for intense prayer on the part of all our people that the ceasefire may be restored," said Brady, urging a political settlement to the 27-year Northern Ireland conflict in which 3,200 people have died.</p>
<p>Security chiefs fear that the latest IRA campaign will force the guerrillas' ideological foes, Protestant Loyalists who want the province to stay British, to end their own ceasefire and return to revenge attacks against the Catholic community.</p>
<p>The Ulster Freedom Fighters, one of the main Loyalist guerrilla groups, said this month that they would go back on the warpath if the IRA killed anyone.</p>
<p>The IRA targetted Britain and a British army base in Germany when it ended its truce but resumed attacks in Northern Ireland last October when it bombed Britain's Northern Ireland army base, killing one soldier.</p>
<p>Police believe Loyalists carried out two bombings this year but their umbrella organisation, the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC), has not declared the truce over.</p>
<p>This has allowed the Loyalists' political spokesman to take part in the Belfast peace talks from which Sinn Fein is excluded until the IRA calls a permanent halt to violence.</p>
<p>David Trimble, leader of Northern Ireland's main political group, the Ulster Unionist Party, urged the CLMC to make clear whether its gunmen were at war or not.</p>
<p>"Their (the CLMC) silence reinforces those who think that the loyalist ceasefire is in the process of breaking down," he told the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).</p>
<p>Billy Hutchinson, whose Progressive Unionist Party is close to the Loyalists, said that the ceasefire was intact but warned that further IRA violence would inevitably draw retaliation.</p>
<p>"If these attacks continue, certainly it will draw loyalists in," he told the BBC.</p>
<p>No one has died in IRA violence yet this year despite a daylight rocket attack on Belfast High Court and mortar attacks on police patrols but police chiefs say it is only a matter of time before the IRA claims a first 1997 fatality.</p>
