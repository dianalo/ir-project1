<p>Alcatel Alsthom chairman Serge Tchuruk said in a newspaper interview on Tuesday that the group's asset sales this year would exceed the 10 billion francs previously announced and he reiterated his forecast for breakeven in 1996 excluding exceptional gains.</p>
<p>"The debt to equity ratio will be brought to 30 percent at the end of the year," Tchuruk told La Tribune. "Even if circumstances are difficult, Alcatel should return to breakeven by the end of the year, excluding capital gains, as I have previously indicated."</p>
<p>"The asset sale programme on which I have embarked will be fully realised this year. We'll do even better than the 10 billion francs in sales that had been announced," he was quoted as saying. "I am very satisfied today."</p>
