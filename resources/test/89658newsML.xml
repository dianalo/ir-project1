<p>He may have only 273 days left in office but the 28th and last British governor of Hong Kong clearly has no intention of seeing them out quietly.</p>
<p>When Chris Patten steps up to the podium on Wednesday to deliver his fifth "state of the colony" address, the last ever by a British governor in the territory, he will, aides promise, deliver a hard-hitting speech demonstrating he is no lame duck.</p>
<p>"It will be personal in tone and strongly political," a source close to Government House said. "It will be both valedictory and visionary in nature."</p>
<p>Patten, a former British cabinet minister who provoked Chinese fury by spearheading democratic reforms and more open government in the twilight of British rule, is unlikely to be content merely to sum up his often controversial four-and-a-half-year stewardship of Hong Kong.</p>
<p>He intends to unveil new initiatives showing the British intend to govern right up to the stroke of midnight on June 30, 1997, when a century and a half of colonial rule ends.</p>
<p>Patten's address to Hong Kong's Legislative Council will be televised live.</p>
<p>"The governor is to argue that he would be doing a disservice for Hong Kong if the government stopped making decisions," said the English-language South China Morning Post on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The paper reported that Patten would announce "hundreds of new initiatives" in his 90-minute address, mainly concerning welfare, the environment and the economy.</p>
<p>The leaks have already caused some dismay, particularly in business and pro-Beijing circles, which have long advocated a policy of minimal change during the countdown.</p>
<p>"In looking to the future, we would like to urge restraint, with little in the way of new initiatives which might prove difficult for the new (post-1997) chief executive and government to implement," the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce said.</p>
<p>But Patten's record suggests he is unlikely to shrink from the challenge. "'Go quietly into the night' has never struck me as a very good motto of guide to leadership in a free society," he told a Hong Kong radio broadcast three weeks ago.</p>
<p>His aides say he intends to grasp the nettle of China's plans to dissolve Hong Kong's elected legislature and replace it with an appointed body, even though raising the issue is likely to ruffle Chinese feathers.</p>
<p>He will warn that Beijing risks eroding confidence in the small but wealthy community of just over six million people.</p>
<p>Beijing remains deeply suspicious of all British initiatives in the countdown to the handover, and the democratic reforms implemented since Patten's arrival in 1992 remain the greatest source of friction, sources involved in the transition say.</p>
<p>While some argue his combative style has wrought uncertainty during the drawn-out transition by provoking Chinese anger, Hong Kong's pro-democracy lobby argue Patten did not go far enough and the changes he heralded were too little too late.</p>
<p>"I have often said that Mr Patten is the best governor Hong Kong has ever had. This is not difficult because the others were so awful," said pro-democracy activist and politician Emily Lau.</p>
<p>But she did credit him with opening up Hong Kong's traditionally aloof and secretive colonial government -- a development clearly welcomed by ordinary Hong Kong people who are likely to look to his yet-to-be-named successor to build on the trend and would take a dim view of attempts to reverse it.</p>
