<title>MALAYSIA: Foreigners always allowed to buy local shares - KLSE.</title>
<headline>Foreigners always allowed to buy local shares - KLSE.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-06-03</dateline>

<p>Foreign investors have all along been allowed to buy "local" shares of Malaysian companies, with no rule change after the introduction of scripless trading, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"KLSE's trading rules have never prohibited foreigners from buying local shares of companies with foreign/local shares," the exchange said in a faxed reply in response to queries by Reuters.  </p>
<p>"Even before the CDS (central depository system) was introduced, foreigners have always been allowed to buy and sell local shares. This has not changed in any way with such companies being brought into the CDS," the statement added.</p>
<p>The exchange issued the statement following some market confusion last week on the foreign and local tranche of the stock of Public Bank Bhd.</p>
<p>Public Bank's foreign shares plunged while its local shares soared on market belief that the bank would soon allow foreign investors to buy its local stock.  </p>
<p>The exchange said individual companies have the right to decide if foreign investors whose investments exceeded a company's foreign shareholding limit will be entitled to all stock entitlements, including voting rights.</p>
<p>"The respective companies will decide whether foreigners who are holding shares in excess of the limit will be accorded entitlements atached to the shares that they are holding," KLSE said.</p>
<p>It said when foreign investors buy a stock's foreign tranche under the scripless CDS, they are automatically registered and accorded with all entitlements attached to the foreign shares.  </p>
<p>The exchange completed its conversion of all stocks to the scripless, or paperless electronic, system at the end of last year.</p>
<p>The foreign buying of "local" shares will still be credited into their CDS accounts, but they will not get the benefit of automatic registration.</p>
<p>Public Bank in its statement issued over the weekend said it has all always allowed foreigners to buy above the 30 percent foreign shareholding limit imposed by the authorities.</p>
<p>The bank said it was proposing that foreigners who hold above the 30 percent stock limit would in the future not be allowed voting rights.</p>
