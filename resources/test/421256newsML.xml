<p>A group of 29 Albanians fleeing violence in the southern port of Vlore arrived in Italy on Wednesday after their small boat was intercepted by a navy frigate in the Adriatic, coastguards said.</p>
<p>Italy's RAI state television reported earlier that a boat with 15 Albanians on board had been stopped off the southern Italian town of Otranto, opposite Vlore.</p>
<p>Coastguards said later that there were 29 on board, including nine children.</p>
<p>The boat was escorted into the Italian harbour and customs police said the men would spend the night in containers made ready in the port area for arriving immigrants. The women and children were accommodated by the local church.</p>
<p>The ANSA news agency reported some of the Albanians had requested political asylum while others had permits that allowed them legal entry into Italy.</p>
<p>It said the Albanians had bought the motorboat for $30,000 in Vlore, leaving the port in the afternoon.</p>
<p>One 17-year-old student was quoted as saying that his family had been living in Italy previously but had returned to Vlore to set up businesses with money they had earned.</p>
<p>"Now there is nothing left there, everything has been looted," he said. "We came here to work, we hope we can stay."</p>
<p>Another boat was also reported sighted farther north but was later found to be a merchant ship.</p>
<p>The frigate Espero earlier rescued two Albanian adults and three Italian children from a small boat.</p>
<p>Coastguards said the five came from Vlore, where more than 20 people have been reported killed since Friday.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the coastguard's office in Bari said a woman was taken to hospital in the town of Brindisi.</p>
<p>RAI said the two adults were grandparents of the children, whose father was Italian and mother Albanian.</p>
<p>It said the mother was in prison in the Italian town of Lecce for suspected drug smuggling and the father, who helped the family flee Albania and then returned to Vlore on an accompanying boat, was wanted on the same charges.</p>
<p>Albania has imposed a state of emergency to try to quell violence which has erupted since the collapse of dubious get-rich-quick investment schemes in Europe's poorest state.</p>
<p>Albanian army and police forces pushed towards the south on Wednesday to quash an armed rebellion.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Albanians made a mass exodus to Italy in 1991 after 45 years of Stalinist rule in the impoverished Balkan country crumbled.</p>
<p>Patrols have been boosted along Italy's Adriatic coast to try to ward off a fresh wave of immigrants.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, two Albanian pilots landed their MIG-15 aircraft at a military base near the town of Lecce and asked for political asylum.</p>
<p>Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said on Wednesday that as yet there were "no elements to make us believe a massive wave of Albanian refugees towards our coasts is likely."</p>
<p>He said 15 Italians, mostly members of religious orders, remained in the area around Vlore and had decided to stay, while remaining in constant contact with their embassy.</p>
