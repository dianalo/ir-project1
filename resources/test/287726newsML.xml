<title>TAIWAN: Offshore scramble for future of Taiwan futures.</title>
<headline>Offshore scramble for future of Taiwan futures.</headline>

<p>A race for Taiwan's potentially significant futures market begins this week with a number of American exchanges vying for investors.</p>
<p>An aggressive, Asia-focused Chicago Mercantile Exchange had hoped to be first out of the gate Thursday with electronic trading of new futures and futures options contracts linked to Taiwan's stock market performance.</p>
<p>However, the CME is now expected to be overtaken by the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, or SIMEX, which will launch open-outcry trading of similar Taiwan index contracts just minutes earlier.</p>
<p>San Francisco's venerable Pacific Stock Exchange, bolstering its claim as a U.S. gateway to Asia's financial markets, will begin trading Taiwan stock-index options a day later.</p>
<p>All are defying Taiwan regulators' appeals to go slow in a race to meet what they call intense demand overseas -- and in Taiwan -- for derivatives linked to Taipei's effervescent stock market, one of the world's top 15 in capitalisation and turnover.</p>
<p>Taiwan has no local futures exchange, something long scorned as a gamblers' plaything with little legitimate value. Its stock exchange is unlikely to offer index options before mid-1997.</p>
<p>Playing for time to build a futures infrastructure, Taiwan has stopped short of deeming the rivals hostile but has withheld technical cooperation and threatened to cut off access to stock price data crucial to their indexes.</p>
<p>The fate of Taiwan's own planned futures exchange remains a hostage of parliament, still bickering over at least three rival drafts of an enabling Futures Trading Law.</p>
<p>At the same time, Taiwan's watchdog Securities and Exchange Commission has refused to let foreign financial institutions use the local exchange's proprietary TAIEX index.</p>
<p>Nor has it legalised trading of offshore Taiwan index futures by Taiwan brokerages or investors, who are expected to skirt the ban by opening "underground" accounts offshore.</p>
<p>Analysts say local investors, who can legally trade overseas commodities futures, have legitimate need of a stock market hedge. Experts estimate Taiwan stock-index futures could fuel T$50 billion (US$1.8 billion) a month in turnover the first year.</p>
