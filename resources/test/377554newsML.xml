<p>NYNEX Corp Chairman and CEO Ivan Seidenberg said Wednesday he expected New York authorities to approve the company's proposed merger with Bell Atlantic Corp within three or four weeks.</p>
<p>He expected the merger to be completed by April 1.</p>
<p>NYNEX and Bell Atlantic agreed in April last year to merge, forming the second-largest U.S. telecommunications company under the Bell Atlantic name.</p>
<p>Seidenberg told Reuters in an interview that he was "disappointed and surprised" by New York Attorney General Dennis Vacco's opposition to the merger.</p>
<p>Vacco said last week that the merger could quash competition in the state and was not in the public interest. He filed a brief with the New York Public Services Commission saying his department opposed the merger.</p>
<p>"The Justice Department is the ultimate policy maker on the anti-trust law. They are still looking at this. We are confident they will be OK," Seidenberg said.</p>
<p>"I would also point out that 11 or 12 other state attorneys general have already in effect passed on this and suggested there's nothing unusual about it," he added.</p>
<p>He said he did not think Vacco's position would sway the New York Public Services Commission, which must rule on the merger.</p>
<p>Asked how confident he was of getting approval from New York state authorities for the merger, Seidenberg said: "We still feel that we'll get approval of this in the next three or four weeks and close it by April 1."</p>
<p>The Federal Communications Commission and the Justice Department are the only other two bodies that must still approve the merger.</p>
<p>Seidenberg, who was attending a Forbes Magazine conference on "Worldwide Infrastructure Partnerships" in San Francisco, said he believed the merged company had the potential to grow fast both internationally and in the United States.</p>
<p>"What we're doing now is making investments for the purposes of future growth that we think out in time will start to produce very, very fast growth for us," he said, adding that the company would see fast growth internationally.</p>
<p>"I'm hoping growth in our home markets will be just as fast because, remember, we get a chance to enter new markets, markets we've never been in before -- long distance and cable -- so I think that we can emulate a growth market as we enter things we are not in today," he said.</p>
<p>Asked whether the combined company would have all the assets it needs to compete with other industry giants or whether it would need to make acquisitions, Seidenberg said: "We don't feel we need to make any acquisitions ... Other companies, I'd suspect, don't have the assets that we have," he said.</p>
<p>"We have local networks, we have cellular networks, we are moving into long-distance networks, we have Internet access, we are beginning to move into the distribution of multimedia and video, so over the course of several more years we will have a full portfolio well in advance of anybody else," he said.</p>
