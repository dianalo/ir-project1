<p>These are the main headlines on Hungary's Kossuth Radio midday news. Reuters cannot vouch for their accuracy:</p>
<p>- Legal experts said it is doubtful whether the state can recover the 800 million forints the APV paid Marta Tocsik as consultancy fee.</p>
<p>- Officials said privatisation will continue unimpeded despite the sacking of APV's board of directors.</p>
<p>- Some Socialists disagree with the sacking of Industry and Trade Minister Tamas Suchman.</p>
<p>- Opposition Smallholders Party will seek to initiate a no-confidence vote against the government.</p>
<p>- The Tocsik-affair is not only about excessive consultancy fees, as some say it has only highlighted how confuse and without direction the privatisation process is.</p>
<p>- The government plans to simplify adoption procedures, but this will not facilitate foreigners adopting Hungarian children.</p>
<p>- Famous Hungarian singer Judit Halasz is still in critical condition after a police car hit her on Friday.</p>
