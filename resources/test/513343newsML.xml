<p>Uniden Philippines Inc said on Wednesday it decided to temporarily shut down its plant in Taguig, south of Manila, due to violence by employees staging a strike.</p>
<p>In a statement, Uniden said "the strikers have resorted to harassment, intimidation, physical violence on company workers, destruction of company property and other illegal acts...."</p>
<p>The closure of the cellular phone component plant will ensure the safety of the majority of its 4,000 employees, the company said.  </p>
<p>The strike is being staged by a labour union with 200 member employees. The union could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>The company did not say when it plans to resume operations.</p>
<p>Uniden Philippines exports the entire output of its plant to its parent firm Uniden Corp.</p>
<p>Uniden Corp makes mobile telephones, cordless telephones and satellite broadcasting receivers.</p>
