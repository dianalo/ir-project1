<p>Northern Afghan militia commander General Abdul Rashid Dostum withheld recognition on Sunday of the Taleban movement's new administration in Kabul.</p>
<p>"We do not recognise them (Taleban)," Mohammed Yussef, a spokesman for Dostum's Jumbish-i-Milli faction, told Reuters in an interview. "If they want to form a government, they must ask for our counsel."  </p>
<p>The Taleban Islamic militia seized the Afghan capital on Friday virtually unopposed and now controls most of the mountainous nation, torn apart by years of civil war. It set up an interim ruling council on Friday.</p>
<p>Dostum's forces control several northern provinces but have largely stayed out of the confrontation between ousted president Burhanuddin Rabbani's government and the Taleban.</p>
<p>Dostum himself, an ethnic Uzbek, has so far kept silent on events in Kabul. A Jumbish official said he would make a statement on Monday.</p>
<p>But the Taleban's capture of Kabul has placed the wily general, usually adept at playing off Afghanistan's warring factions against each other to his own advantage, in a precarious position.</p>
