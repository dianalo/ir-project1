<p>Ousted Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani said on Thursday his forces were at the gates of Kabul but would not re-take the city by force and urged his Taleban foes to negotiate a ceasefire.</p>
<p>Rabbani, on a private visit to Paris for a medical checkup, proposed that all the country's factions hold talks under the auspices of the United Nations to end the fighting and declare the capital an open, demilitarised city.</p>
<p>"Our forces are at this moment outside the gates of Kabul... but the military objective is not to fight inside the city," Rabbani told a news conference at a Paris hotel.</p>
<p>He said his troops were, at one location, four kms (2.5 mile) from Kabul and stepping up pressure to force the Moslem fundamentalists to leave the city they captured in September.</p>
<p>But they would not bomb the city, including Taleban military facilities, in order to avoid a bloodbath among civilians.</p>
<p>"We invite (Taleban) to cease fighting and accept negotiations with the other Afghan parties," Rabbani said.</p>
<p>"We strongly believe that the solution is a political solution with the cooperation of the United Nations," he said.</p>
<p>Rabbani said he had proposed to the Taleban and the U.N. that Kabul be declared an open and demilitarised city under the control of a mixed Afghan police force and U.N. observers.</p>
<p>He said negotiations should then start between all Afghan factions for a ceasefire and a government of national unity until Afghans could freely choose their own government.</p>
<p>He said the Taleban Islamic fundamentalists had so far refused to negotiate.</p>
<p>Rabbani in effect endorsed proposals made at a U.N. meeting on Monday of representatives of 19 countries and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference who said there could be no military solution to the Afghan conflict and urged a political settlement.</p>
<p>The Taleban movement dismissed the U.N. meeting as contrary to the wishes of the Afghan people.</p>
<p>Rabbani said the key to a settlement of the Afghan conflict was the end of foreign interference. He said he hoped the recent dismissal of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto would signal a change in Pakistan's backing of the Taleban.</p>
<p>While he had no strong evidence to back reports that the United States was supporting the Talebans and Saudi Arabia was financing them, he said the Talebans had "enormous" financial means that Pakistan would be unable to provide.</p>
<p>"We call upon our U.S. and Saudi friends to think twice and stop Pakistani interference," he said.</p>
<p>Rabbani said Taleban forces in Kabul were very nervous. He accused them of planning to gather civilians into a human shield to prevent an attack on the city.</p>
<p>He said the fundamentalists, who have been radically enforcing Islamic law in Kabul, recently cut off the fingers of a young girl who was wearing nail polish.</p>
<p>He accused them of sheltering training camps for international terrorists and embarking on a plan to rapidly develop poppy farming and produce heroin.</p>
<p>"We are surprised that the international community remains indifferent to this terrorist and drug-smuggling movement...This is a very big danger for the region and the whole world," he said.</p>
