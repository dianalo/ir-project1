<p>The planned sale of German state utility Berliner Kraft und Licht AG (BEWAG) to a German-American consortium for 3.19 billion marks ($1.9 billion) may not yet be completed, a state legislator said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"For us the Bewag sale is not yet a done deal," said Volker Liepelt, a deputy in the Berlin city-state parliament and a leader of the ruling coalition partner Christian Democrats.</p>
<p>On German radio Liepelt warned the government, scrambling to whisk Berlin from the jaws of bankruptcy, must not sell one of its most attractive assets for less than it its worth.</p>
<p>"We are living at a time and with a fiscal situation where every single mark counts, that is why we take the right to review contracts and check this," he told InfoRadio.</p>
<p>Analysts estimated that Berlin's Bewag stake was worth at least 3.3 billion marks and some said the company, which is nearing completion of an expensive modernisation of its infrastructure in east Berlin, could have fetched four billion marks or more.</p>
<p>The city's finance senator had earlier said Southern Co of the United States, plus Germany's Veba AG and Viag AG would be acquiring Berlin's stake in the monopoly for 2.9 billion marks.</p>
<p>The three companies will pay Berlin another 290 million marks for additional, unspecified factors.</p>
<p>"We cannot just remain indifferent to the whether we sell the business for 2.9 billion marks or whether some banks say that Bewag is actually worth 300 or 400 million marks more," Liepelt said.</p>
<p>Berlin, which is struggling to plug a five billion mark deficit in its 45 billion mark budget this year, will attempt to sell nearly six billion marks of holdings in 1997.</p>
<p>The German anti-trust agency has already expressed its doubts about the sale.</p>
