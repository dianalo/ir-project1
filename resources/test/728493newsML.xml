<p>Opposition politician Richard Leakey warned on Tuesday that Kenya's Indian Ocean port and tourist centre of Mombasa was the next focus of an opposition-backed drive for constitutional reforms which has sparked violent clashes in the capital, Nairobi.</p>
<p>Leakey, secretary-general of the unregistered Safina party, told Reuters the National Convention Executive Committee (NCEC) behind the reform campaign sought government agreement by the end of July.</p>
<p>"The NCEC is coordinating ... and Mombasa has been identified as the next major event," said NCEC member Leakey, Kenya's former wildlife guardian and a renowned palaeontologist</p>
<p>"We are conscious that Mombasa could turn very violent and are very conscious of the consequences and would hope to reach an understanding with the government by the end of the month," he added.</p>
<p>"The reform movement including opposition parties is very clear on its position: mass action will be used on an escalating basis to bring about constitutional reform," Leakey said.</p>
<p>"Nobody is calling for violence in the reform movement. But people hijack mass action and chaos might erupt because police beat people and violence ensues," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>At least nine people were killed in Kenya on July 7 during the country's worst political violence in seven years when riot police broke up a day of demonstrations called by the NCEC.</p>
<p>The July 7 violence, which closed down Nairobi, was followed by several days of student unrest in the capital last week and this week by two straight days of clashes between police and polytechnic students in the same city on Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mombasa, Kenya's main Indian Ocean port and the centre of its coast tourism industry, has been quiet since the opposition -backed campaign for reforms started protests in June.</p>
<p>Tourism is Kenya's leading source of foreign exchange.</p>
<p>In a statement on Tuesday, Safina threatened more unrest in Kenya unless President Daniel arap Moi's ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) party agreed to constitutional reforms before this year's presidential and parliamentary elections.</p>
<p>Safina, denied official registration since its formation two years ago, gave KANU two options to proceed with the reforms.</p>
<p>In a statement, it welcomed an announcement last week by KANU leaders that they would soon meet to review their response to the calls for the reforms, which would reduce Moi's power.</p>
<p>Safina said KANU had to make a clear decision on reforms to head off the opposition campaign of "No reforms, no elections". No date has been set for the general election in which Moi, 73, and Kenya's ruler for 19 years, will seek a new five-year term.</p>
<p>Safina urged KANU to immediately repeal "certain laws and sections of certain laws that will provide an environment where there can be genuine freedom of association and expression..."</p>
<p>"In recognition of the scope of work to be done, KANU representatives must negotiate with the political parties currently termed the opposition to extend the life of the present parliament and the term of the presidency by two years to facilitate the reform agenda in full," the party said.</p>
<p>"The only alternative would be for KANU and the government to accept the minimal reform agenda...and effect these demands well in advance of the general election so that it can proceed with at least an element of being a little fairer," it added.</p>
<p>"In our view there are no alternatives and should the government, as directed by KANU, offer less, the call for further mass action must be strengthened," the party said.</p>
<p>One of the "minimal" constitutional reforms demanded by the opposition is changes in the Societies Act, which requires all political parties to apply for and obtain official registration before they can function fully as parties and recruit members.</p>
<p>Such reforms would allow Safina to operate as a full party.</p>
