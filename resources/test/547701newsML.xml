<headline>WHX says tender for Dynamics oversubscribed.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-04-29</dateline>

<p>WHX Corp said Tuesday that, at the present time, about one million shares of Dynamics Corp of America's stock have been tendered to the depositary under WHX's tender offer for up to 649,000 shares of Dynamics.</p>
<p>In response to the announcement of a court order preliminarily enjoining its tender offer, WHX said it was reviewing the order and will announce its response in "the near future".</p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Dynamics Corp announced that the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut had issued a preliminary injunction against WHX in connection with its tender offer.  The court ordered WHX to make further disclosures on certain issues and extend the tender offer, currently scheduled to expire tonight, for an additional 20 days.</p>
<p>WHX has launched a hostile bid for up to 649,000 shares, or about 17 percent, of Dynamics's stock at $45 a share. This stake, if added to its current 2.9 percent holding, would give it ownership of 19.9 percent of Dynamics' common stock, just under Dynamics' anti-takeover provision which kicks in when another party acquires a 20 percent stake.</p>
