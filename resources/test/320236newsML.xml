<p>Property and banking stocks are expected to propel Hong Kong's Hang Seng index to 14,000 points on Monday, with Friday's records on Wall Street expected to give the local market a boost, brokers said.</p>
<p>"The U.S. market is still strong and Hongkong Bank (HSBC) hit a record high in London, so I suppose due to the strength of property stocks we should easily break through 14,000 today," said Edwin Cheung, dealing director at Taiwan Securities.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index ended at a record close of 13,856.40 on Friday. Later, the Hang Seng London Reference index gained 38.40 to 13,894.80 points.  </p>
<p>Shares in HSBC Holdings rose to a high of HK$185.325 during London trade on Friday.</p>
<p>The Dow industrials rose above 6,800 points for the first time on Friday, gaining 67.73 to 6,833.10.</p>
<p>"I suppose we could be up 150 points," said Geoff Galbraith, institutional sales trader at Nava SC Securities. "May be some people are underweight in Hong Kong and have to buy index stocks," he added.</p>
