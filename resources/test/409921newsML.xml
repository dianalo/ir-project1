<p>A new drug for treating heart failure, which won grudging approval from a U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel this week, could offer hope for patients with the deadly condition, doctors and analysts said on Friday.</p>
<p>SmithKline Beecham's carvedilol, marketed as Coreg, takes a novel approach to heart failure and could be useful, the panel decided. The FDA usually follows the panel's advice.</p>
<p>Trials have shown the drug, which combines the action of beta-blockers, slowing the heart rate and lower blood pressure, with a secondary effect of dilating blood vessels, can help heart failure patients live longer.</p>
<p>Heart failure is one of the most hopeless conditions. Half of all men diagnosed with it die within 20 months and half of all women in about two years.</p>
<p>Symptoms include extreme breathlessness, severe water retention that causes swelling, weight loss and general frailty.</p>
<p>"Heart failure is a malignant condition that is worse than cancer," said Dr Graham Jackson, a leading cardiologist at Guy's Hospital in London.</p>
<p>But some doctors and pharmaceutical analysts think Coreg can help change this.</p>
<p>"Current treatment is pretty poor," said Dr Andrew Baum, a pharmaceuticals analyst at Salomon Brothers.</p>
<p>This usually consists of ACE inhibitors, which are prescribed to lower blood presssure, and beta-blockers.</p>
<p>But Coreg acts differently by helping offset the damage done by ischaemia, caused when a clot or fat blocking the arteries reduces the amount of oxygen getting to the heart muscle.</p>
<p>It also helps stop high blood pressure from thickening blood vessels, a condition that further cuts blood flow.</p>
<p>Dr Milton Packer of Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, one of the world's top heart researchers, found a 65 percent reduction in death from heart failure with Coreg and a 27 percent reduction in the need to go to hospital.</p>
<p>But later studies were not so decisive. So the FDA has so far declined to approve Coreg for treating heart failure.</p>
<p>Thursday's decision by the FDA advisory panel sent SmithKline shares up in the United States and briefly in London but they settled back down later on Friday, hovering around 919 pence in London and $56 in New York.</p>
<p>Baum believes Coreg could prove a real "blockbuster", routinely prescribed for heart failure along with ACE inhibitors and diuretics. "We predict sales of 350 million pounds ($570 million) worldwide for Coreg in 2000," he said.</p>
<p>Reaction from doctors was more cautious.</p>
<p>Jackson already uses Coreg for heart failure and is pleased with the results but says he is being very careful.</p>
<p>"You can't just use the drug willy nilly in the community. The patients have to be very carefully selected and the drug started at a very low dose in hospital," he said.</p>
<p>But he added: "Carvedilol is a good advance and a logical one. It attacks the hormonal problem that makes heart failure worse."</p>
<p>Combined with ACE inhibitors, it "adds up nicely," he said.</p>
<p>Dr Brian Kirby, a coronary heart disease specialist at the University of Exeter, is less impressed with Coreg.</p>
<p>"I think we've got a way to go yet," he said.</p>
<p>Jackson said prevention was still the aim -- despite a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association last week that said most of the recent decline in deaths from coronary heart disease had occurred because of improved management of patients rather than lifestyle changes.</p>
<p>Coreg is approved for heart failure in Canada, Sweden, Denmark, Spain, Mexico and Israel. It is widely approved for use in treating high blood pressure. ($1=.6140 Pound)</p>
