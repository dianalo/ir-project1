<title>MALAYSIA: KL overnight rate steady on lack of lenders.</title>
<headline>KL overnight rate steady on lack of lenders.</headline>
<dateline>KUALA LUMPUR 1997-05-07</dateline>

<p>The overnight interbank rate was steady at around 7.0 percent on Wednesday due to continued shortage of lenders in the market, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Though the market is quite flush, there are not many lenders," said a dealer at a Malaysian bank. "Banks are also wary about lending lower amid uncertainty over the market direction. This has kept rates steady."</p>
<p>Dealers said a maturity of Bank Negara bills worth 500 million ringgit on Friday will have little impact as the market was supported at the current levels, partly due to reduced activity.</p>
<p>They said they expected the central bank to call for a fresh Bank Negara bill issue next week.</p>
<p>Dealers said there was also a persistent rumour about a possible long-term government bond issue soon, which would mop up liquidity and roll over maturing bonds. A 900-million ringgit long-term government bond issue will mature on May 15.</p>
<p>Earlier, short-term interbank rates were bidded up by finance companies seeking fresh funds, dealers said.</p>
<p>"Finance houses are bidding up rates. A couple of big banks are also believed to be short of funds," said one dealer.</p>
<p>One-week money was unchanged at 6.8/7.0 percent, two-week at 7.10/20 percent against 7.00/10 on Tuesday and three-week at 7.20/25 percent from 7.10/20.</p>
<p>One-month money at 7.25/30 percent, three-month at 7.30/35 and six-month at 7.35/40, were all unchanged.</p>
<p>Interest rate futures on the Malaysia Monetary Exchange fell back after gains on Tuesday.</p>
<p>At 0900 GMT, the benchmark three-month Kuala Lumpur Interbank Offered Rate (KLIBOR) September contract was down one point to 92.68, or an implied yield of 7.32 percent.</p>
<p>December and March 1998 were also down one each to 92.67 and 92.60, or 7.33 and 7.40 percent respectively.</p>
