<p>Baxter International Inc, upon reporting higher second-quarter sales and earnings from continuing operations, said Thursday that it expects to grow net income in 1997 in the low double digits.</p>
<p>The company also expects to exceed its goal of generating a minimum of $300 million in operational cash flow, said company president Harry Kraemer.  </p>
<p>"We expect our positive financial trends to continue," Kraemer said.  "We also are making significant progress on integrating the operations of our recent acquisitions of Immuno and RMI into our existing biotech and cardiovascular businesses, respectively."</p>
<p>The healthcare products maker reported second-quarter sales increased 18 percent to $1.57 billion, from $1.33 billion in the year-earlier period.  Without the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, sales rose 21 percent, Baxter said.</p>
<p>Net income from continuing operations increased 14 percent to $162 million, from $142 million in the 1996 second quarter. Earnings per share from continuing operations rose 12 percent to $0.58 per share, from $0.52 per share the prior year.</p>
<p>Baxter said second-quarter sales gains were fueled by strong growth in biotech and IV systems/medical products.</p>
<p>Non-U.S. sales grew 22 percent to $832 million, up from $684 million in the 1996 second quarter.  Second-quarter U.S. sales were $737 million, up 13 percent over the prior year.</p>
