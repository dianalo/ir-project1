<p>Nine Turkish soldiers, including an officer, were shot dead in an ambush by Kurdish rebels battling for self-rule in southeastern Turkey, military sources said on Sunday.</p>
<p>Turkish forces killed two Kurdish rebels after sending in helicopter-backed support to the region.</p>
<p>The sources said the Turks came under attack by guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) near Kemaliye township in the southeastern province of Erzincan.</p>
<p>The incident occurred about 5:30 p.m. (1430 GMT) on Saturday when the Turkish troops were returning from a military operation. The sources said they believed a group of 40 PKK militants behind the attack had been cornered in the region.</p>
<p>"Heavy clashes are continuing since last night and we suspect the death toll and casualties may mount," said a military official who asked not to be identified.</p>
<p>It was the biggest PKK action inside Turkey since the Kurdish faction's leader Abdullah Ocalan declared a renewed war last week in response to Turkey's saying it might impose a 10-km (six-mile) -deep security zone inside Iraq to repel the PKK.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 people have been killed in the 12-year-old PKK fight for independence or autonomy in southeast Turkey.</p>
