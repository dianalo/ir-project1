<title>USA: COMEX copper ends weaker after rangebound session.</title>
<headline>COMEX copper ends weaker after rangebound session.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK 1997-07-03</dateline>

<p>COMEX copper ended weaker in a dull, and abbreviated session ahead of the U.S. Independence Day holiday.</p>
<p>COMEX is closed Friday and reopens Monday.</p>
<p>Despite a further hike in LME stocks overnight and occasional easing in the London cash-to-three months backwardation, COMEX was able to hold on to most of Wednesday's late rally gains.</p>
<p>Copper consolidated this week after a sharp 10-cent drop late last week.</p>
<p>Traders said there was little feature in Thursday's dealings which were light and rangebound.</p>
<p>COMEX September copper settled 0.65 cent weaker at 111.25 cents a lb, traded 111.90 to 110.70 cents. Spot June went out 0.15 cent lower at 113.45 cents.</p>
<p>LME stocks rose 425 tonnes to 130,500 tonnes. COMEX stocks have been falling sharply this week, but dealers said the metal was moving into LME warehouses in the U.S. following arbitrage deals.</p>
<p>The LME cash to three months backwardation ended at $153/$158. With the bulk of the tightness in July, nearby prices were expected to remain firm for the time being, dealers said.</p>
