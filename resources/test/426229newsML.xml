<p>Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko agreed on Friday to push for closer union between their two Slav states and reiterated their common hostility towards NATO's eastward expansion plans.</p>
<p>Yeltsin, who looked energetic and fit, welcomed the hardline Belarus president in his Kremlin residence, saying Moscow was committed to seeking stronger ties with its western neighbour.</p>
<p>"Commonwealth with Belarus is the common desire of our peoples and we will not deviate from this path," said Yeltsin, kissing Lukashenko on the cheek.</p>
<p>The two leaders signed a joint declaration that called for integration of their countries' customs, fiscal, transport and energy systems and synchronisation of economic reforms.</p>
<p>The declaration also touched on the sensitive issue of NATO's plans to admit several former Warsaw Pact countries, probably including Belarus's neighbour Poland, later this year.</p>
<p>"Our countries are united in their non-acceptance of NATO's plans for eastward expansion, which will create new lines of division in Europe and dangerous confrontation," it said.</p>
<p>Yeltsin and Lukashenko signed a pact in April 1996 forming an economic "community" but there has been little concrete progress in furthering integration, partly due to the Russian president's long illnesses from which he is only just emerging.</p>
<p>Last year's crisis in Minsk, which saw Russian mediators looking embarrassed and ineffectual as Lukashenko swept aside parliamentary opposition and assumed sweeping powers to rewrite the country's constitution, did not help ties.</p>
<p>Moscow's renewed wooing of Minsk coincides with a diplomatic offensive against NATO's expansion plans and western diplomats say talk of effectively shifting Russia's territorial control westward across Belarus may be one of Yeltsin's strongest cards in his strategy to thwart the alliance's plans.</p>
<p>Yeltsin said in a state of the nation address to parliament on Thursday that reintegration with Belarus was his top foreign policy priority but should not be artificially accelerated.</p>
<p>In his speech, Yeltsin did not mention an idea he first mooted in January that the two sides should hold referendums on integration. Belarus was originally cool to the proposal.</p>
<p>Briefing reporters after Friday's talks, Yeltsin's adviser on foreign relations, Dmitri Ryurikov, said the two leaders did not discuss a possible date for the referendums.</p>
<p>Ryurikov said a bilateral commission overseeing the integration process would meet in Moscow on April 2, the first anniversary of the signing of the "community" pact.</p>
<p>"There are ample grounds for saying that that date will be marked by major new steps in the matter of integration between our two countries," Ryurikov said. He gave no further details.</p>
<p>Lukashenko said on Wednesday he foresaw joint economic, transport, economic and military structures between the two former Soviet republics. With just 10 million people in Belarus compared to 150 million in Russia, Moscow would inevitably call the shots in any joint structures.</p>
<p>Among the difficulties Yeltsin hinted at on Thursday were differences between Moscow and Minsk on economic reform. Belarus has moved slowly to alter its Soviet-era planned economy.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Lukashenko's Prime Minister Sergei Ling said that despite integration with Russia being a top priority, Minsk would take its own path to the market economy.</p>
<p>Lukashenko ordered limits on political rallies on Thursday and banned his opponents from using post-independence national symbols, which he has scrapped in favour of old Soviet ones.</p>
<p>About 5,000 demonstrators protested against Lukashenko's pro-Russian policies last Sunday.</p>
