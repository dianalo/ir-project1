<p>The presidents of Argentina and Paraguay agreed Thursday to postpone the deadline for their respective parliaments to approve legislation to privatize the Yacyreta hydro-electric dam.</p>
<p>The deadline will be extended to April 30 next year from December 31 to give the national parliaments time to pass the necessary laws to privatize the dam jointly owned by the two countries.</p>
<p>The two presidents signed the deal during an unofficial visit by Paraguay's President Juan Carlos Wasmosy to Argentina Thursday.</p>
<p>"The demand from Brazil (for electricity) continues to rise and the indications are for high growth, something which makes it more necessary than ever to finish the privatization as soon as possible," said Argentine Foreign Minister Guido di Tella according to the state news agency Telam.</p>
<p>Yacyreta is one of the world's largest hydro-electric projects.</p>
