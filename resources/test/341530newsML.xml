<p>Lomak Petroleum Inc said the value of its proven reserves more than doubled in 1996 to $492 million, mainly as a result of its acquisition of $400 million worth of properties from American Cometra.</p>
<p>During the year, reserves rose 29 percent to 384 billion of cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe), the company added.</p>
<p>The company said it added 387 Bcfe of proven reserves in 1996, including the acquisition, which was announced January 2. The company said it expects to close the acquisition within 30 days.</p>
<p>A Lomak spokesman said the increase in reserves would mean the company would report increased earnings and cash flow for fiscal 1997 but would not provide specific figures.</p>
