<p>China's management of its foreign exchange reserves was not aimed at making a profit due to the central bank's cautious approach, the Financial News said on Friday.</p>
<p>Operation of the foreign exchange reserves was an important part of China's monetary policy, the newspaper quoted Zhou Xiaochuan, director of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE), as saying.</p>
<p>The central bank must consider the policy benefits of managing its reserves to support other macro-economic policies and macro-economic controls, Zhou, who is also deputy president of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, said.</p>
<p>China has adopted policies to use its foreign exchange more effectively and the rise in the reserves was expected to be slow, Zhou said but gave no further details.</p>
<p>China's foreign exchange reserves have soared to $105 billion at the end of 1996, the largest in the world after Japan, from $21.2 billion at the end of 1993 and $73.56 billion at the end of 1995.</p>
