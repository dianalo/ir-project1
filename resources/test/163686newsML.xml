<p>Malaysia's Hicom Holdings Bhd said on Monday that its subsidiary, HICOM Properties Sdn Bhd has entered into an arrangement with Edaran Otomobil Nasional Bhd (EON) to develop a parcel of land in Singapore.</p>
<p>It said in a statement that HICOM Properties has successfully tendered for the land for S$84 million.</p>
<p>The land is designated as a "white site" which means that it could be used for commercial and apartment or hotel development, the statement said.</p>
<p>Hicom said the financing and equity structure of the venture are being finalised. It said HICOM Properties and EON intend to eventually invite other parties to participate in the venture with the approval of Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority.</p>
