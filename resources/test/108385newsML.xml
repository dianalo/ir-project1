<p>The Clinton administration should choose the next Forest Service chief "from the ranks of forestry professionals" in the agency and not give the job to a political appointee, Senator Larry Craig said Thursday.</p>
<p>Craig, Idaho Republican, also said in a statement that he hoped the administration would consult with lawmakers to ensure the new chief would have a good working relationship with Congress.</p>
<p>"I will definitely hold hearings early next Congress on what direction the new chief plans on taking the Forest Service," said Craig, an Agriculture subcommittee chairman.</p>
<p>Craig was disappointed with Jack Ward Thomas' decision to resign as Forest Service chief.</p>
<p>"Jack was the first chief chosen outside of the traditional path of Forest Service professionals," he said. "Thus, like him, his successor could be a political appointee. This administration should return to tradition and choose the next Forest Service chief from the ranks of ranks of forestry professionals at the Forest Service."</p>
<p>Along with being a career employee, the next chief should have field experience in managing forests, knowledge of natural resources and supervisory experience, Craig said.</p>
