<p>The European Commission postponed a vote on Friday by senior member state veterinary officials on a revised proposal to remove suspect tissue from sheep, goats and cattle, a Commission official said.</p>
<p>The official, speaking after a nine-hours meeting, said that the Standing Veterinary Committee would on Monday re-examine the proposal aimed at curbing the spread of mad cow disease.</p>
<p>The Commission decided to delay a vote after 10 member states expressed opposition, saying that removal of the tissue was economically unjustified in view of the negligeable risk involved.</p>
<p>A previous Commission proposal to remove sheep brains, spleens and spinal cords from human and animal food was rejected.</p>
