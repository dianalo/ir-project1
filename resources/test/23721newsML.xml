<p>Boatmen's Bancshares Inc said Friday the recent acquisition of about two million shares by two board members was not based on any insider information.</p>
<p>"There was no improper trading," Boatmen's chief executive officer Andrew Craig III said in a news conference Friday to discuss the bank holding company's planned acquisition by NationsBank Corp.  </p>
<p>Craig said he had outside counsel review the trades and determined that "there was no trading based on any non-public insider information."</p>
<p>He also said that the board members made the purchases before they knew about NationsBank's $9.5 billion offer for Boatmen's, about a 40 percent premium over recent Boatmen's stock prices.</p>
