<p>Feed firms scrambled on Tuesday to cope with Taiwan's hog foot-and-mouth epidemic, refocussing on chicken feed and other other businesses to make up for their pig feed losses, executives said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>As soldiers carried out the slaughter of some 400,000 hogs, feed companies were suspending their pig feed operations and boosting chicken feed production in anticipation a public shift away from pork.</p>
<p>"We plan to close down our hog business in June, after calculating our losses," Lin Wen-chung, spokesman of leading feed firm Sino-Japan Feed Industry, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"We will concentrate on breeding chickens and producing chicken feed," Lin said.</p>
<p>Lin said the company expected to lose T$40 million (US$1.45 million) because of the outbreak of the deadly contagion.</p>
<p>Sino-Japan would reinvest in other industries and expected to earn a net profit of T$50 million (US$1.81 million) in the third quarter despite the epidemic.</p>
<p>Sino-Japan's shares on Tuesday rose T$0.8 to T$23.20, defying a panicky selloff that has sent many farm-sector firms to successive limit-down losses since officials reported the outbreak and banned all pork exports.</p>
<p>Great Wall Enterprise said its hog feed business, worth about T$900 million (US$32.72 million) a year, would decline sharply in 1997.</p>
<p>It too would shift to produce more chicken feed and increase chicken farming to try to tide over the hog business crisis, said Great Wall president Han Chia-huan.</p>
<p>The epidemic was expected to cost Taiwan in US$1.55 billion in lost exports and reduce the island's gross domestic product by up to one percentage point -- a staggering T$65.2 billion (US$2.37 billion) in 1996 terms.</p>
<p>The government order to slaughter all diseased pigs -- nearly 400,000 out of 14 million hog population -- has seriously battered the hog and its related industries, officials said.</p>
<p>Health and farm officials said the hog industry would need at least three years to recover, and pork exports to Taiwan's main market, Japan, might not resume for five years.</p>
