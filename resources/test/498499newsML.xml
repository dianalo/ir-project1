<p>Arsonists tried to set fire to two cars belonging to the family of Jordan's former intelligence chief who is heading investigations into the shooting of seven Israeli girls last month, newspapers reported on Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said police were called before dawn on Tuesday to the house of Abdul-Halim Kilani, whose father Mohammad is leading the investigation into last month's shooting by a Jordanian soldier at the border area of Baqoura.</p>
<p>Al-Dustour newspaper said a family member, waking for dawn prayers, saw flames erupting from the hood of a Mercedes car owned by Mohammad Kilani but used by his son Abdul-Halim.</p>
<p>Police who put the fire out found bits of carpet and tyres soaked in petrol under the car. They found similar fuel-soaked material under the motor of Abdul-Halim's wife's car.</p>
<p>Officials have not commented on the motives for the attack.</p>
