<headline>Mexican stocks end slightly down, pierce support.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1996-12-24</dateline>
<text>
<p>Mexican stocks ended a fraction lower on Tuesday in dull pre-holiday trade in which the main IPC index fell 0.7 point, or 0.02 percent, to 3,298.47 points.</p>
<p>The index broke the 3,300 support level, but traders said volume was too light to give that much significance. Almost 100 million of the 114.06 million shares traded were crosses or packets of shares. There were only 731 trades.</p>
<p>"Today we broke the 3,300 point level. From here, the next level down is 3,270 points, but the movements were due to inertia, not so much because there was selling."  </p>
<p>Of 84 issues traded, 37 fell, 25 rose, and 22 were unchanged.</p>
