<p>U.S. rail freight traffic as measured in intermodal rose 7.5 percent in the week ended November 16 from the year-ago week, the Association of American Railroads said Thursday.</p>
<p>AAR said that intermodal traffic, which does not include carloads, totaled 172,089 trailers and containers in the week versus 160,101 in the year-ago week.</p>
<p>Ton-miles also rose 1.5 percent to 26.4 billion in the week from 26.0 billion a year ago. A ton-mile, a measure of freight transportation, equates one ton of freight hauled one mile.  </p>
<p> But carloads, at 353,000, were virtually unchanged from 353,017 in the same 1995 week.</p>
<p>"Severe winter weather in the Great Lakes states had an impact on ore traffic, down 16.6 percent for the week," Harvey Levine, AAR chief economist, said. AAR reported 18,457 metallic ores carloads in the week versus 22,131 in the year-ago week.</p>
<p>    But Levine added that "grain loadings are continuing the surge that began last month." AAR said grain loadings rose 10.6 percent to 29,694 from 26,856 last year.</p>
<p>AAR also reported a 10.3 percent increase to 16,728 carloads of crushed stone, sand and gravel from 15,164 a year ago. It said lumber and wood products rose 9.6 percent to 5,344 carloads in the week from 4,876 last year.</p>
<p>Metals and related products also increased by 3.8 percent to 11,919 carloads from 11,486 last year, while motor vehicles and equipment carloads climbed 2.3 percent to 21,732 from 21,253.</p>
<p>But farm products other than grain plunged 21.4 percent to 2,194 carloads from 2,790 a year ago, while primary forest products, at 7,561 carloadings in the week, were down 12.6 percent from 8,652 in the same 1995 week.</p>
<p>Nonmetallic minerals also fell 11.1 percent to 8,186 carloads in the week from 9,204 last year.</p>
<p>In the first 46 weeks of 1996, AAR said ton-miles rose two percent from the same period last year. Intermodal traffic also rose 1.6 percent, but carloads fell 0.6 percent, AAR said.</p>
