<headline>Sprint sets new shareholder rights plan.</headline>

<p>Sprint Corp said Monday its board of directors approved a new shareholder rights plan that replaces a plan in place since 1989.</p>
<p>The plan was not adopted in response to any specific threat to acquire control of Sprint, and the board is not aware of any such activity, the company added.</p>
<p>The new plan contains most of the elements of the previous plan, as well as enhancements aimed at better enabling the board to act in the best interest of shareholders in the event of a proposed takeover.  </p>
<p>As part of the adoption of the new plan, existing rights will be redeemed and the new rights will be distributed as a dividend.</p>
<p>The redemption price for the existing rights and the dividend of the new rights will be paid to holders of common stock and class A common stock of record as of close of business on June 24.</p>
<p>The redemption price will be one-half cent a common share, which accounts for a two-for-one stock split in 1989, and will be paid on or about July 15.</p>
<p>The rights generally will be able to be exercised only if a person or group acquires 15 percent or more of Sprint's common stock and class A common stock or announces a tender or exchange offer that would result it owning 15 percent or more of the stock.</p>
<p>Each new right will initially entitle the holder to purchase one one-thousandth of share of a new series of preferred stock at an exercise price of $225. The new rights are redeemable at a price of $0.01 per right and will expire on June 25, 2007.</p>
<p>Sprint is a global communications company.</p>
