<p>Belgian Budget Minister Herman Van Rompuy said on Friday that talks on the 1997 budget would resume on Saturday after exploratory talks earlier this week.</p>
<p>"Work is progressing well," he said, adding there were no solid estimates yet about the size of the austerity effort needed, or what measures would be taken.</p>
<p>Analysts have estimated that Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene's centre-left government will have to come up with at least 80 billion francs ($2.62 billion) in austerity measures to cut the deficit to the Maastricht Treaty target of three percent of gross domestic product in 1997.</p>
<p>Belgian media have speculated that higher taxes on petrol, alcohol and tobacco and the privatisation of part or all of another three banks will be some key measures in the 1997 budget. Other possibilities are a ceiling on top pensions, a reduction of family allowances and lower benefits for the long-term unemployed.</p>
<p>The budget is due to be presented to parliament early in October.</p>
