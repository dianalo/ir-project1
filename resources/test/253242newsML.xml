<p>New York Gov. George Pataki proposed gradually ending rules that set rents for 1.2 million apartments, which nearly all are in New York City, according to the New York Times' Thursday edition.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, another Republican, Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno, urged that most rent regulations be ended by mid-1999, but his plan was opposed by New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who also is a Republican.  The issue is expected to be a major battle in negotiations over the state's next budget.</p>
<p>The governor was quoted by the Times as saying "I don't want to negotiate in the press.  But I'm hopeful that we can bridge the differences between those who don't want any changes and Senator Bruno, who wants a very, very quick change, and come up with a reasoned transition that protects those who need our protection and has an orderly transition to a more market-oriented system."</p>
