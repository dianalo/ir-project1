<p>Moroccan Finance Minister Mohamed Kabbaj said on Thursday Rabat had no plan to devalue its local currency, the dirham, despite persistent rumours on the market.</p>
<p>The dirham has fluctuated in recent weeks at between 8.5 and 8.7 dirhams against the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>"These are normal flucutations...In any case we have no plans to devalue our national currency," the minister told Reuters.</p>
<p>France is Morocco's leading European Union trading partner and some exporters, fearing increased competition from their Spanish counterparts, have argued in favour of devaluation.</p>
<p>Against the French franc, the dirham has been trading recently at between 1.6 and 1.7 dirhams.</p>
<p>The dirham is at present not fully convertible except for transactions by foreign companies operating in Morocco and for local firms engaged in business abroad.</p>
<p>A Bank al-Maghrib (central bank) official said earlier: "It (devaluation) would have a negative impact on the economy."</p>
<p>The Moroccan dirham was last devalued officially by 9.25 perecent in 1990.</p>
<p>($1= 8.7 dirhams)</p>
