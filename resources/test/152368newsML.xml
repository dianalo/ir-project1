<p>Indonesian President Suharto has called on state oil company Pertamina to increase production of unleaded gasoline to control automobile emissions, Environment Minister Sarwono Kusumaatmadja said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The president is very aware of the urgent need for air pollution control," he said after meeting Suharto. "Therefore the programme for controlling air pollution must be accelerated."</p>
<p>Sarwono said the president had ordered state departments to coordinate efforts with Pertamina to boost the use of gas and unleaded gasoline in automobiles.</p>
<p>"The development of using gas for automobiles is slow. The president wanted Pertamina to increase the (facilities)."</p>
<p>"The production of unleaded gasoline also must be increased, because it will contribute to the environment. The use of petrol with lead must be phased out soonest," the minister said.</p>
<p>He gave no time frame for the move.</p>
<p>Sarwono said Pertamina must make changes in its refineries to boost production of unleaded petrol, adding that the move could cost about $300 million.</p>
<p>Pertamina currently produces a small amount of unleaded petrol from its Balongan refinery in West Java.</p>
