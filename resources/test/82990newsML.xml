<p>Alcatel SEL, the German unit of France's Alcatel Alsthom, said on Friday that it expected to reduce its operating loss in 1996 but restructuring charges would cause a significantly higher bottom-line loss.  </p>
<p>Alcatel SEL, an electronics business, announced first half operating losses down 54 percent to 130 million marks.</p>
<p>But a charge of 533 million marks to cover 1,300 job cuts this year and 1,700 in 1997 pushed total losses to 663 million marks. Last year's comparative loss was 265 million marks.</p>
<p>The company said that, despite difficult market conditions, sales, incoming orders and total orders had all risen in the first half.</p>
<p>Sales rose by 27 percent to 1.889 billion marks, boosted by a large order from Deutsche Telekom. Incoming orders were up by 22 percent to 2.349 billion marks, while the order book grew by 255 million marks to 4.154 billion marks.</p>
<p>The company was also positive on the operating outlook for the full year.</p>
<p>"Although market conditions will remain difficult in 1996 we expect improved incoming orders and a bigger order book. Turnover will probably also exceed last year," the firm said.</p>
<p>Although the restructuring measures will lead in 1996 to "deep cuts and financial burdens", the company said that the conditions had been created to return to profit in 1997.</p>
