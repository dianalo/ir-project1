<p>Shares in Zeneca Group Plc gave up early gains and moved lower amid profit-taking in the European drug sector, dealers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Zeneca shares were down 18 pence, or 0.97 percent, to 1843p by 1500 GMT, while the FTSE-100 index was 38.7 points, or 0.89 percent, higher at 4384.8.</p>
<p>The stock hit a 1897p intra-day high during the morning, just below the 1900p level which has proved a stumbling block on a few occasions for the company over the past couple of months.</p>
<p>"The stock has had a good run and now it has lost some steam," said one trader.</p>
<p>Another dealer said "Zeneca is just being Zeneca," referring to the stock's high intra-day volatility.</p>
<p>Drug sector analysts were today briefed during a site visit to a Zeneca operation in Surrey, England, the company said.</p>
<p>There was no immediate feedback from analysts.</p>
