<p>Procter &amp; Gamble Co on Thursday said worldwide unit volume in its first quarter ended September 30 grew by one percent over the year-ago period, but sales for the quarter fell one percent.</p>
<p>Sales, at $8.90 billion, were hurt by unfavorable exchange rates, particularly in Japan and Germany, Procter said.</p>
<p>Procter also said the company's results were affected by competitive pressures in Japan and difficult economic conditions in Latin America.  </p>
<p>Further, Procter said unit volume increased by three percent in North America, led by the laundry and cleaning business.</p>
<p>Unit volume in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, grew by five percent, led by growth in Central and Eastern Europe. But sales in the region were down one percent due to unfavorable exchange rate movements.</p>
<p>The company said unit volume in Asia fell nine percent in the quarter. China's unit volume growth was below recent levels, as trade inventories were adjusted in response to price increases taken earlier in the quarter.  </p>
<p>China's unit volume is expected to rebound in the second quarter, they said.</p>
<p>Sales in Asia declined fourteen percent. About nine percent of the drop was due to exchange effects, they noted.</p>
<p>Latin American unit volume in the quarter was down six percent compared with the first quarter of last year, reflecting declining markets due to slow economic recovery in key markets.</p>
<p>Sales were down one percent, as pricing policies designed to address inflation and devaluation trends helped offset the volume softness.</p>
<p>Earlier, Procter announced net earnings for the July-September quarter of $979 million or $1.39 per share, a nine percent increase over prior year earnings of $896 million or $1.27 per share.</p>
