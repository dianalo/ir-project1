<p>Ten mainly left-wing MPs of the ruling Labour party criticised British Airways Plc chief executive Bob Ayling on Wednesday for what they called the "worst kind of macho management" in his dispute with the airline's ground staff and cabin crew.</p>
<p>The members of parliament, led by left-winger Ken Livingstone, signed a motion expressing concern that Ayling was preparing for full-scale confrontation with his workforce.</p>
<p>They said his handling of the dispute constituted a "fundamental attack on internationally recognised trade union rights" and urged him to withdraw threats to his employees as a first step in solving the dispute.</p>
<p>Calling for the airline to negotiate, the MPs said: "The election of a new government provides the opportunity to move on from the brutal industrial relations of the Thatcher years."</p>
