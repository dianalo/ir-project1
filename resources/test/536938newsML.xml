<p>A European Commission warning that Italy is lagging in the race to join EMU is likely to be a spur for government action rather than a death knell for its hopes of signing up for a single currency, economists said.</p>
<p>The Commission forecast on Wednesday that Italy's 1997 deficit would be 3.2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), just wide of a three percent ceiling set to join European economic and monetary union (EMU) at the planned outset in 1999.</p>
<p>The Italian government has cried foul, accusing the Commission of double standards in its interpretation of economic data. Apart from Italy, Greece was the only country told it was in danger of failing to make the grade.</p>
<p>"There was special caution in weighing up the data of our country whereas other countries were promoted before they have even taken measures," Finance Minister Vincenzo Visco told Corriere della Sera newspaper.</p>
<p>Visco appeared to be referring to France and Germany, both EMU front-runners now struggling to meet the EMU criteria. The Commission forecast that both countries would just make the three percent deficit-to-GDP target.</p>
<p>But economists said it was by no means all over for Italy even though it faced an uphill struggle persuading its European Union partners, particularly Germany, that it had the credentials to join EMU at the outset.</p>
<p>"The Commission has sent a little reminder that the game is not up yet but that Italy has not done enough either. It's a way of keeping the pressure up," said Darren Williams, an economist with UBS in London.</p>
<p>The speaker of the Senate, Nicola Mancino, said that Italy had to press ahead with planned welfare reforms that alone can deliver a lasting fall in the public sector's borrowing needs.</p>
<p>Italy had to respond to Brussels "by pushing forward with ... a difficult course directed at a reform of a structural nature", said Mancino.</p>
<p>Forcing Italy's deficit ratio down to 3.2 percent by the end of 1997 would in itself be an achievement that many people would have thought unattainable as recently as six months ago, an irony that was not lost on Visco.</p>
<p>Italy's public sector deficit was 6.8 percent in 1996. "To fall from (nearly) seven percent to around three percent is in any case an operation without precedent," said Visco.</p>
<p>But the sting in the Commission's message was a forecast that the deficit would blow out to 3.9 percent in 1998 unless corrective action was taken.</p>
<p>This was a signal of EU concern that Italy's belt-tightening drive, which includes an array of once-off revenue-raising measures, could unravel later even if it comes within spitting distance of the three percent target in 1997.</p>
<p>The moment of truth will come when the government sits down to hammer out a package of cuts biting into Italy's pensions system -- a move that would put the loyalty of the centre-left government's communist allies to to a severe test.</p>
<p>That will determine whether the government can put together a convincing deficit-slaying budget for 1998 and keep alive its hopes of joining EMU at the start.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi's administration was nearly brought down earlier this month when the Marxist-inspired Communist Refoundation party -- on whose votes he relies in the lower house of parliament -- opposed sending troops to Albania.</p>
<p>"What we have seen is a dress rehearsal for the diplomatic battle Italy will have to fight next year. The immediate consequence will be to accentuate the debate on pensions reform," said Lorenzo Stanca, chief economist at Credito Italiano in Milan.</p>
