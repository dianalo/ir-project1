<p>Nippon Oil Co Ltd said on Thursday it would cut the wholesale price of its oil products by 1.8 yen per litre, effective April 1.</p>
<p>As a result of the cut, the wholesale price of gasoline will be 91.2 yen per litre and 69.5 yen for gas oil, including tax, the leading refiner said.</p>
<p>Kerosene, which is not taxed at the wholesale stage, will be 37.4 yen per litre, the refiner said.</p>
<p>The cut in April prices reflects a fall in the price of February-loading crude and a planned reduction in the import tariff on crude oil, Nippon Oil said.</p>
<p>Under a long-term programme, the Japanese government has decided to lower the import tariff on crude oil to 215 yen per kilolitre from fiscal 1997/98 starting on April 1, from 315 yen at present.</p>
