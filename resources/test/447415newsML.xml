<p>Ailing Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko sought to rally his crumbling government against relentlessly advancing rebels on Monday by telephoning ministers from his hospital bed in the Riviera principality of Monaco.</p>
<p>Aides said Mobutu, admitted to hospital for "additional treatment" of his prostate cancer on Sunday, telephoned twice during a cabinet meeting in Kinshasa and his son and spokesman said he was determined to return to Zaire very soon.</p>
<p>"He is in good health. He came for extra medical tests. He will leave the hospital very soon to prepare for his return home," spokesman Mobutu Nzanga said after visiting his father.</p>
<p>Mobutu, 66, in power for 32 years, has spent most of the last eight months in Europe convalescing from prostate cancer as Tutsi rebels led by Laurent Kabila have captured more than a fifth of the country, putting his ragged army to flight.</p>
<p>Zaire Foreign Minister Kamanda wa Kamanda, who is in Brussels, said he too had spoken by telephone to Mobutu three times on Monday and expected him to be released from hospital within hours.</p>
<p>The French Foreign Ministry said Mobutu's health was "a source of concern" in the clearest indication so far that his physical state was deteriorating along with his grip on power.</p>
<p>"Mobutu's health is an additional source of concern in the Zairean crisis," Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt told a regular briefing.</p>
<p>The Zairean cabinet had to put out a statement denying rumours that Mobutu was dead or had been toppled by a coup after the rebels captured the third-largest city, Kisangani, virtually without a fight on Saturday.</p>
<p>Mobutu's aides spoke for the first time of "treatment" at Princess Grace hospital in Monte Carlo. They had described his previous visits to the clinic as being for tests.</p>
<p>France is the last outside power to back Mobutu. Foreign Minister Herve de Charette this month called him "undoubtedly the only person capable of contributing to solving the problem".</p>
<p>De Charette renewed a call for a ceasefire, already rejected by Kabila, but appeared to distance France from events in Zaire, telling France-Info radio: "Frankly, I don't think we have real interests in that part of the world. We have duties, but that is true for the whole international community."</p>
<p>France has accused Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi of backing Kabila and tried in vain to mobilise Western powers to intervene militarily to provide relief to Rwandan Hutu refugees trapped by the rebels' advance.</p>
<p>Kabila has refused United Nations calls for a ceasefire and vowed to go all the way to Kinshasa to "liberate" Zaire.</p>
<p>The rebels, advancing on several fronts, said they were aiming next for the southern mining hub of Lubumbashi, capital of mineral-rich Shaba province. Pweto, 400 km (250 miles) north east of Lubumbashi, fell on Thursday.</p>
<p>Mobutu, one of Africa's longest-serving strongmen, was given a triumphant welcome when he returned to Kinshasa in December by crowds who believed he could save the country from collapse.</p>
<p>But after ordering a counter-offensive, hiring hundreds of white mercenaries and shaking up the army command, he refused to negotiate with the rebels or compromise with his political foes and withdrew to his jungle palace in Gbadolite, about 1,000 km (600 miles) from the capital.</p>
<p>After a second visit to Zaire, Mobutu returned to France on February 21 for more medical tests and had planned to go home last week. But his departure was delayed.</p>
