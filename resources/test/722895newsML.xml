<p>The Dow industrials made small gains in early trading on Friday and Nasdaq was relatively flat, as the equities market focused on corporate earnings reports rather than the broader economic picture.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up around 10 points at 7897, and the Nasdaq composite shifted between positive and negative ground, trading off 1.01 points at 1489.</p>
<p>The long bond gained 4/32 at a 6.56 percent yield, getting a lift from the release of the June Producer Price Index, which showed little evidence of inflation.  </p>
<p>"It's earnings period and all eyes are on that, because the bond market has been very stable," Guy Truicko, portfolio manager at Unity Management, said.</p>
<p>"The market looks okay but I don't think we're going to close above 8,000 on the Dow," he said.</p>
<p>Among active issues, shares of MCI Communications Corp sank 6-5/8 to 35-3/4, after the telecommunications company said its earnings for the second half of 1997 and going into 1998 would fall below Wall Street expectations.</p>
