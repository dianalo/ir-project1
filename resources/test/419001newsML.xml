<p>French hotel and tourism group Accor said it will set up a joint venture in Spain with the financial holding controlling Spanish hotel chain NH Hoteles.</p>
<p>The agreement signed earlier on Tuesday in Madrid involves the creation of 60 Ibis hotels in Spain over the next five years.</p>
<p>"We must capitalise on the expertise of NH in Spain and Accor's know-how regarding hotel creation," Didier Gros, the joint-chairman of Sphere International, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Gros and Jean-Claude Luttman head Sphere International, the company that groups the budget hotels of the Accor chain.</p>
<p>The 50-50 venture will be headed by NH president Antonio Catalan.</p>
<p>Total investment was put at two billion pesetas. But the initial investment will amount to 20 milion francs, evenly shared by the two partners.</p>
