<p>Growth in the New Zealand economy will pick up in the current quarter, the Bank of New Zealand said in its January Economic Review, published on Thursday.</p>
<p>But the bank said it feared a strong economic downturn in 1998.</p>
<p>"We estimate growth to have been at its weakest in the September and December quarters, and that activity levels will pick up from the March quarter of 1997," BNZ said.</p>
<p>The bank had a positive outlook for the economy during 1997 into early 1998 based on the following factors:  </p>
<p>* The recent rise in business and consumer confidence levels, BNZ's expectation of further rises during the March quarter, and the traditional flow-through from such rises into higher investment, retail spending, house buying etc.</p>
<p>* The recent decline in interest rates and BNZ's expectation of another 0.5 percent to 1.0 percent coming off bank bills by the September quarter.</p>
<p>* A strong investor preference for property, which will ultimately boost construction and prices.</p>
<p>* Higher house prices which will boost perceived wealth and therefore spending.  </p>
<p>* A slightly weaker exchange rate.</p>
<p>* Firm, though not accelerating, overseas growth.</p>
<p>* Increased government spending.</p>
<p>* Mild anticipation of the tax cuts in 1997, mainly relevant for the December quarter and early 1998.</p>
<p>* A pick-up in employment growth from the middle of the year.</p>
<p>* Construction activity related to the America's Cup, retailing developments, commercial and industrial property (falling vacancy rates), and infrastructure such as electricity generation.  </p>
<p>BNZ said the main risks to its positive scenario were interest rates rising earlier than it had forecast, the fall off in net immigration being greater than it expected, the exchange rate rising further, and the coalition government falling apart (for which BNZ assigned a relatively low probability).</p>
<p>The bank said its fears of a strong downturn in consumer spending during 1998 remained.</p>
<p>"Our concern is that householders will get too confident during 1997 and push house prices to much more overvalued levels, raising inflation in combination with loose fiscal policy, eventually extra wages growth, and a weaker exchange  </p>
<p>rate, forcing interest rates to quite high levels by early 1998."</p>
<p>This next cyclical rise in interest rates would spur a downward correction in house prices, assisted by householders focusing on the recent unsustainable growth in their debt levels, the bank said.</p>
<p>"This downturn will, possibly in a relatively short period of time, allow interest rates to fall strongly below their cyclical lows this time around, allow a full correction to the overvalued exchange rate, and see the exporting sector lead the economy up during 1999," BNZ said.  </p>
<p>"Our main hope in spelling out this scenario, which we give about a 60 percent to 70 percent probability, is to inject an element of caution into business expansion plans from the middle of 1997."</p>
