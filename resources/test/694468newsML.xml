<p>Guards at the Bulgarian embassy in Jakarta have ejected four East Timorese youths who jumped over the embassy wall, sources close to the embassy and police said on Saturday.</p>
<p>"The four have tried to enter the embassy on Friday morning, but were ejected. The motive of their move is unclear. They were then interrogated by security officers," one source told Reuters by telephone. The source gave no further details.</p>
<p>A policeman on duty confirmed the four had entered the embassy but were then ejected.</p>
<p>"They were kicked out. The case is now being handled by the military," he said.</p>
<p>Military and embassy officials could not be reached for comment and it was unclear whether the Timorese were in custody.</p>
<p>Since September 1995, 108 East Timorese have entered foreign embassies in Jakarta and asked for political asylum, which has always been granted by Portugal, the former colonial ruler of East Timor.</p>
<p>Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it the following year in a move not recognised by the United Nations.</p>
<p>Last February, guards at the Palestinian embassy ejected four East Timorese who jumped over the embassy seeking political asylum.</p>
