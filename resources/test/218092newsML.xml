<p>Leading European shares followed New York's soaring Dow higher on Tuesday with London hitting a new trading peak ahead of the British budget and Frankfurt breaking records in both electronic and bourse trading.</p>
<p>On the currency markets, the dollar was holding at around a three-week high of 1.5237 marks first touched in overnight dealings.</p>
<p>Against the yen the dollar was above overnight troughs and retaining a firm foothold above 112.00 yen ahead of the Bank of Japan's (BOJ) fourth-quarter Tankan survey of business sentiment due at 2350 GMT.</p>
<p>Analysts said the BOJ's survey would be a crucial gauge of what the Japanese economy is doing and interest rate prospects</p>
<p>"If we get a strong Tankan, the yen will do well on the back of that, and we could see dollar/yen retracing back to 111.00 yen. But if it comes in line with expectations then, I don't see it having a major impact," said Yamaichi's Chester.</p>
<p>The dollar also gained ground against the French franc as the lorry drivers' strike intensified and as Bank of France Council Member Paul Marchelli was quoted as saying French interest rates should be cut as soon as possible.</p>
<p>At 1100 GMT, the dollar stood at 5.1640 francs against 5.1290 in late dealings on Monday.</p>
<p>But the real exitement in European markets was on the stock exchanges after Wall Street soared 76 points, or 1.71 percent, overnight to pierce the 6,500 barrier for the first time. It was its 11th record in 12 sessions and the biggest one-day points gain since August.</p>
<p>Britain's blue chip FTSE 100 index opened sharply higher ahead of Tuesday's budget, setting an intra-day record at 4,094.4, up 28.3 points, before slipping slightly. The previous FTSE record was 4,073.2, set on October 21.</p>
<p>Traders said hopes for a "prudent" non-inflationary budget from Chancellor Kenneth Clarke (starting at 1530 GMT), coupled with New York's performance, had been the motive force.</p>
<p>"We are bound to start getting a bit nervous after the initial reaction to Wall Street," said one dealer. "I expect us to drift back and stocks to turn mixed until we see what Clarke has to say."</p>
<p>Traders said they expected to see the corporate sector's tax burden increase to offset any drop in personal taxes designed to woo the electorate ahead of a general election which must be held by May next year.</p>
<p>In Frankfurt, German shares opened pre-bourse electronic dealings sharply higher at new peak and went on to open floor trading well above the previous all-time high.</p>
<p>The DAX 30 index was up 20 points at 2,819.5 shortly after the bourse opened -- surpassing its previous trading record of 2,799.19 set on Monday. It later fell back somewhat from that level.</p>
<p>Dealers said the boost had come not only from Wall Street but also from the firmer dollar, which makes German exports more attractive.</p>
<p>In Paris, French shares firmed at the opening, with a jump of 0.34 percent on the CAC-40 index. They later retreated into negative territory on concerns about the franc and fears the truckers strike could provoke widening labour unrest.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel continued to suffer and was down 6.43 percent at 6.55 francs after last week's fire in the Channel Tunnel.</p>
<p>In London platinum was fixed at $379.00 an ounce on Tuesday morning, the lowest fixing since December 10, 1993. The metal had previously fixed at $381.75 an ounce on Monday afternoon. Platinum prices have been trending lower in recent months due to slack demand and ample supplies.</p>
<p>CURRENCIES AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>The dollar was quoted at 112.45 yen and 1.5233 marks against 112.62 yen and 1.5208 marks late on Monday.</p>
<p>STOCK MARKETS AT 1100 GMT</p>
<p>The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 22.9 points higher at 4,077.5.</p>
<p>In Paris, the CAC-40 share index was down 2.37 points at 2,274.77.</p>
<p>The 30-share DAX index in Frankfurt was up 12.19 at 2,811.38.</p>
<p>PRECIOUS METALS</p>
<p>Gold fixed at $374.50 compared with Monday's close of $375.05. Silver was off four cents at $4.77.</p>
