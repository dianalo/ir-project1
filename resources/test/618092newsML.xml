<p>---------------VIEWS FROM THE MARKET - May 27------------------</p>
<p>Copper prices are expected to consolidate on Tuesday but should maintain their recent upside bias despite over-extended signals, traders and chartists said.</p>
<p>Aluminium is expected to find support and may move higher following a constructive chart close on Friday, they added.  </p>
<p>COPPER - Expected to consolidate above $2,500 and may test resistance at $2,550 despite its overbought condition. "Good support centred around $2,500 is preventing prices from aggressively testing the downside, although volatility in the $2,500/$2,550 range can be expected given that the RSI at 77.60 percent remains seriously overbought," LME brokers Brandeis said in their daily market review.</p>
<p>Support is likely to be found from a tight physical market which has seen nearby spreads remain tight. London Metal Exchange stocks are expected to register a small fall on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Harry Creates of AMT agreed that the market was over-extended and also believed that prices needed to consolidate before breaking higher. He pegged initial resistance at $2,530, followed by $2,550.</p>
<p>Creates expected support at $2,498 and $2,470.</p>
<p>Following the long holiday weekend in the UK and U.S. three months copper was indicated at $2,513/18 versus Friday's late London close of $2,516/20.  </p>
<p>ALUMINIUM - Friday's recovery from lows at around $1,610 has helped offset recent down-trending charts and suggests that prices may probe towards resistance at $1,650, market operators said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>But to rekindle significant upside momentum aluminium needs to overcome stiff resistance at $1,650 and heavy resistance up to $1,678.</p>
<p>On the downside good support is given by the convergence of the 30-day and 100-day moving averages at around $1,620, Brandeis said.</p>
<p>Martin Squires of Rudolf Wolff pegged support at $1,600/$1,590, while Creates of AMT said support was available at $1,610 and $1,595.</p>
<p>At 0725 GMT three months aluminium was indicated at $1,645/47, versus $1,634/37.</p>
