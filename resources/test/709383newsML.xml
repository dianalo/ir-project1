<p>Seven rockets slammed into northern Israel on Sunday night after a day of fierce fighting between the Israeli army and Hizbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon, pro-Israeli militia sources said.</p>
<p>In Beirut, the pro-Iranian Hizbollah said it fired Katyusha rockets on Israeli positions in the Jewish state's occupation zone in southern Lebanon, inflicting injuries.</p>
<p>The pro-Israeli militia sources said seven rockets landed inside northern Israel.</p>
<p>"There were a total of seven rockets fired which landed in northern Israel," said a pro-Israeli militia source.</p>
<p>There were no immediate details on casualties from the rocket attack on northern Israel, the militia sources said.</p>
<p>A Hizbollah spokesman in Beirut said: "The Islamic resistance fired several rockets at Israeli positions in the occupation zone. There were direct hits and injuries."</p>
<p>In Jerusalem, an Israeli army statement, quoting preliminary reports, said mortar bombs and Katyushas were fired at Israeli forces and their local militia allies in the western and eastern sectors of the occupation zone.</p>
<p>"Some of the shells fired by terrorists fell north of the security zone and caused damage. It is possible that some of the shells fired by terrorists fell inside of Israeli territory," said the statement.</p>
<p>Israeli security sources in Jerusalem said there were no injuries or serious damage caused by the rocket attack and that the assault was apparently aimed at military posts and not civilian targets.</p>
<p>Under a U.S.-brokered deal that halted Israel's 17-day blitz of Lebanon in April 1996, Hizbollah is obliged to refrain from firing Katyusha rockets into Israel.</p>
<p>The accord, which ended a blitz that killed 200 people, mainly civilians, banned shooting from or at civilian areas in Israel's war in south Lebanon with Hizbollah guerrillas.</p>
<p>Israel said its blitz was meant to destroy Hizbollah and stop it firing Katyushas at northern Israel.</p>
<p>Hizbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust Israeli troops and their local militia allies from the 15-km (nine-mile)-wide border zone they hold in south Lebanon.</p>
<p>The reports of rocket attacks came after a day of heavy clashes between Israeli forces and Hizbollah (Party of God) fighters in the zone that triggered Israeli air raids.</p>
<p>An Israeli soldier, Major Nadav Milo, 24, was fatally wounded in the fighting with Hizbollah.</p>
<p>He was the 12th Israeli soldier to be killed in Lebanon this year. Last year, 27 Israeli soldiers died in Lebanon.</p>
<p>In Beirut, a Hizbollah spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack and said several Israeli soldiers were killed.</p>
<p>"We will continue carrying out attacks against the Zionists," he said.</p>
<p>Israeli artillery also engaged the guerrillas in duels in which three Lebanese civilians, including two boys, were wounded.</p>
<p>Israeli warplanes launched three separate assaults on Hizbollah positions, raising to 45 the number of Israeli air raids on Lebanon this year.</p>
