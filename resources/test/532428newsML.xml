<p>NYMEX electricity futures were trading lower Wednesday, backing off morning highs, on weaker Western physical power prices and some loss of strength in natural gas futures, industry sources said.</p>
<p>"What we're seeing is considerably weaker cash (electricity) prices, and I think natural gas got a little bit overdone and everyone reacted to that," said one Houston-based electricity futures trader.</p>
<p>As of 1210 EDT, May Palo Verde (PV) was trading down 33 cents at $18.55 after morning trade at a new contract high of $19.00, while June PV was down 46 cents at $18.80 after exchanges as high as $19.20 per megawatt hour (MWh).</p>
<p>August PV was down 45 cents at $25.40 per MWh after reaching as high as $25.85 per MWh.</p>
<p>Southwestern physical electricity prices were said to be talked lower with expectations of some cool temperatures and a lessening of recent air conditioning demand, sources said.</p>
<p>Southwest temperatures were called to average from five degrees Fahrenheit above normal in the far west to nine degrees below normal in the extreme east.</p>
<p>As of 1210 EDT, May California Oregon Border (COB) was trading down 26 cents at $13.85 after reaching as high as $14.30, while June COB was down 33 cents at $12.75 after exchange as high as $13.10 per MWh.</p>
<p>August COB was down 15 cents at $19.05 per MWh.</p>
<p>Weather forecasts in the Northwest called for temperatures to average from seven degrees above normal in the extreme northwest to seven degrees below normal in the the southeast area.</p>
<p>NYMEX said as of 1140 EDT an estimated total of 191 COB and 69 PV contracts had traded.</p>
<p>As of 1215 EDT, NYMEX Henry Hub May natural gas futures were trading up 1.2 cents at $2.126 per million British thermal units, while remaining deferreds were trading mostly down between two and three cents.</p>
<p>Higher natural gas futures prices in recent days were said to have put some upward pressure on the electricity futures.</p>
<p>Also contributing to electricity weakness was expecations of the return of some generation in the West that has been off line for maintenance or repairs, sources said, including reports that two coal-fired units at the Jim Bridger generating complex in Wyoming may resume operation today.</p>
<p>COB open interest for April 22 rose 95 to 4,507 while PV open interest fell 17 to 5,253, NYMEX said.</p>
