<p>French pay television group Canal Plus is preparing to leave the German pay television market altogether and focus on European countries that hold more promise for it, like Italy, company executives told the annual meeting.</p>
<p>"(Germany) is a market which will doubtless be very important, but is at the same time very slow, and this at a time wehn we are offered a historic and strategic opportunity -- and we have already started work here -- of taking full (managerial) responsibility in the exceptional Italian market," Pierre Lescure, the chairman of Canal Plus, said on Friday.</p>
<p>A Canal Plus executive said earlier that talks with Germany's Bertelsmann over Canal Plus selling its 37.5-percent stake in German pay TV channel Premiere were not yet over.</p>
<p>Bertelsmann and Bavarian media magnate Leo Kirch last week ended a long squabble for control of Premiere and agreed to share it 50-50.</p>
<p>Canal Plus wants to swap its Premiere stake for Kirch's 45 percent in Italian pay TV channel Telepiu, which would give it 90 percent of Telepiu.</p>
<p>It also wants to sell its 25 percent in German TV channel Vox, but would still sell its thematic channels to German pay television services, executives said.</p>
<p>The deal over Premiere and Telepiu would probably bring Canal Plus a cash sum, they said.</p>
<p>Lescure said Premiere, which has nearly 1.5 million subscribers, was "fairly close to its maximum valuation", and said he would give figures on this at a Canal Plus board meeting next Wednesday.</p>
<p>Analysts said Telepiu was valued at $1,600 per subscriber during Canal Plus's merger with Nethold, finalised in April, through which Canal Plus acquired its Nethold stake.</p>
<p>Michel Thoulouz, Canal Plus managing director for international affairs, said a Telepiu subscriber was worth the same as a Premiere subscriber.</p>
<p>Premiere currently has nearly 700,000 subscribers more than Telepiu.</p>
