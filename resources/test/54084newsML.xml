<p>Millions of Moroccans have voted overwhelmingly for King Hassan's plans to set up a powerful upper house of parliament to strengthen regional influence and economic development, official figures showed on Saturday.</p>
<p>Just over six hours after polling ended in Friday's referendum on constitutional reforms, the Interior Ministry said 99.56 percent, or more than 10.16 million of the 12.34 million people on the electoral role, had voted "yes".</p>
<p>Turnout in the vote was 82.95 percent.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Driss Basri told a news conference in Rabat on Saturday that innovations in the new constitution "consolidate decentralisation...enlarge the responsibilities and prerogatives at the regional level on the one hand, and correct the regional disparities... ."</p>
<p>He pointed out that division of the existing 333-seat parliament would bring about direct voting in the lower house -- the new House of Representatives -- and set up an upper Chamber of Counsellors with "the power to dismiss the government under specific conditions".</p>
<p>Upper house members will be indirectly elected, mainly through local councils, professional bodies and trade unions.</p>
<p>Under the changes, "Development Plans" would be launched and worked out by the High Council of National Promotion and Planning, while other changes would bring greater control of finance bills and public money.</p>
<p>"Next week, the government will start to examine the draft laws which will go to parliament for debate," Basri said.</p>
<p>The debate is expected to end in December.</p>
<p>No firm date could be set for dissolving parliament and setting up the new houses, but he expected the "electoral process" not to end before June next year.</p>
<p>Pro-government and opposition parties had called for a "yes" vote, but many of those casting their ballots gave their reason as loyalty to King Hassan.</p>
<p>"I voted today to respond to King Hassan's appeal," said Khadija al-Idrissi, a 42-year-old housewife, casting her ballot on Friday at the Lycee Hassan II in the capital, Rabat.</p>
<p>Officials say the changes will help ensure development in rural areas, home to 50 percent of Morocco's 27 million people, and a major contributor through farm products to foreign currency earnings.</p>
<p>Morocco's main opposition parties, the old-guard Istiqlal party and Socialist Union of People's Forces (USFP), both of whom have long demand direct elections to parliament, both called for a "Yes" vote.</p>
<p>Only some small parties called for a boycott or a "No" vote. One of the parties, the Avant-Garde Democratic and Socialist Party, said on Friday that police had arrested 10 of its members while they were campaigning on Thursday for a boycott of the referendum. An Interior Ministry official said he was not aware of the arrests.</p>
