<p>The French government said on Tuesday it wanted to sell the SFP film studio to a consortium of Generale des Eaux and Havas, conditional upon approval by the Privatisation Commission.</p>
<p>In a joint statement, the Culture Ministry and the Ministry of Economy and Finance said that the state would make a maximum capital injection of 1.2 billion francs into Societe Francaise de Production (SFP), of which a first 350 million francs would be paid before the end of 1996.  </p>
<p>The statement said Culture Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy had met European Commissioner Karel Van Miert in Brussels on Monday to discuss the planned capital injection and it added Van Miert had assured him of help in bringing the privatisation to a rapid conclusion.</p>
<p>"He (Van Miert) accepted the principle of a very quick opening of the examination procedure which would allow the European Commission to approve, in principle before the spring, the state's financial effort in the privatisation framework," the statement said.</p>
<p>It said that the cash injection was needed because of the financial and economic situation of the SFP and would allow the future shareholders to run the normal operating risks and contribute 40 percent to the costs of a job reduction plan.</p>
