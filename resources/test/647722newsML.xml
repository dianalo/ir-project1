<p>Europe's key stock markets were mixed at midday on Monday after a strong early rally following Wall Street's record close on Friday went into reverse, while the dollar steadied above six-month lows against the yen.</p>
<p>"We've just run out of steam a little bit," one London share dealer.</p>
<p>London shares were up 13.10 points, or 0.3 percent, at 4,658.1 by 1200 gmt, while French and German shares were down around 2.0 and 0.7 percent respectively, having seen all the opening gains eroded.</p>
<p>All Europe's leading share markets opened firmer in the wake of Wall Street's record-breaking form on Friday when the Dow Jones index of blue chip shares surged 130.49 to close at 7,435.78, beating the old record of 7,383.41 set on May 27.</p>
<p>The U.S. market got a shot in the arm from the May U.S. jobs report which revealed that while the unemployment rate dipped to 4.8 percent in May, it also indicated slower-than-expected job growth in May.</p>
<p>London's FTSE 100, which had been up around 40 points during the early surge, extending Friday's 68.8-points rise -- its biggest one-day rise of the year so far, saw most activity in bank shares.</p>
<p>"The banks gave us a leg up at the start but interest has fallen off a bit since," the London share trader said.</p>
<p>National Westminster Bank led the sector higher after a report in the Sunday Times said there was pressure from NatWest's major institutional shareholders for a bid or merger.</p>
<p>The newspaper said a deal could value the underperforming stock at 10.00 pounds. Separately, the Daily Telegraph said Abbey's chief executive had backed a merger with NatWest but had backed down after resistance from the rest of the company's board. In morning trade, NatWest gained 20-1/2p to 801p whilst Abbey climbed 14-1/2p to 874p, though both then retreated a touch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile gilt futures were unsupportive, slipping back after the latest economic data revealed higher-than-expected producer prices in May. Industrial production and manufacturing output in April were also stronger than forecast.</p>
<p>"The manufacturing data comes in the face of a strong pound and tends to vindicate the Bank of England's recent decision to hike rates," a GNI research report said.</p>
<p>French shares started higher and twice tried to break through 2,750 points, but then turned negative and had extended their losses at midday on the back of worries about about a possible delay to EMU.</p>
<p>German shares also shed their early gains as worries about monetary union escalated and the dollar slid against the mark, though volume was thin and this increased the market's volatility.</p>
<p>In currencies, the dollar steadied above six-month lows against the yen at around 112.55 after Japanese officials tried to offset concern about trade relations between the United States and Japan by stressing their desire for stable exchange rates. It stood at around 1.7135 marks compared with Friday's late level of 1.7261.</p>
<p>Speculation that Japan's trade surplus will be discussed by the Group of Seven leading industrial nations next week drove the dollar down more than two yen in Asia as low as 111.80, its weakest since November 25, 1996.</p>
<p>U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky sparked such concern after she said on Friday the U.S. was concerned about the potential for a rise in Japan's trade surplus with the U.S..</p>
<p>"Barshefsky's comments gave no new fundamantal insight but were timely as they reminded the markets about the natural focus on trade ahead of the G-7 meeting," said Paul Meggyesi, a currency strategist at Deutsche Morgan Grenfell.</p>
<p>Japanese officials quickly stepped in to limit the damage by calling for currency stability. Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said Japan will do its utmost to achieve currency stability. His deputy, Tadashi Ogawa, said he hoped for stable currency trading and that he was not aware that Japan's trade surplus would become a specific focus at the G-7 meeting in Denver between June 20-22.
