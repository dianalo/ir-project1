<headline>Australia's Optus confirms float delay.</headline>
<dateline>SYDNEY 1996-11-29</dateline>

<p>Telecommunications group Optus Communications on Friday confirmed shareholder Mayne Nickless Ltd's earlier announcement that Optus' planned float would not be held this calendar year because of litigation between shareholders of its Optus Vision pay television offshoot.  </p>
<p>"Optus Communications today confirmed that Channel Seven's litigation with other Optus Vision shareholders over shareholder rights is the key reason for postponement of the proposed Optus float," Optus said.</p>
<p>Optus Communications Chairman Russell Fynmore said in the Optus statement that the timing of the float would be subject to further review of the legal action by the Seven Network.</p>
<p>"But Optus acknowledges Mayne's and other institutional investors' desire to seek the earliest possible date," Fynmore said.  </p>
<p>Mayne holds 25 percent of Optus Communications Pty Ltd and had planned to distribute the stake to its shareholders through an entitlements issue.</p>
<p>Mayne said as recently as November 12, at its annual general meeting, that it hoped to achieve a share market float in calendar 1996.</p>
<p>Concerns over the timing of the float had been raised by a legal dispute between Optus Vision, 46.5 percent owned by Optus Communications, and the Seven Network Ltd, which holds two percent of Optus Vision and has an option to raise this to 15 percent.  </p>
<p>Other Optus Communications shareholders include BellSouth Corp and Cable and Wireless Plc, who each have 24.5 percent stakes.</p>
<p>The dispute centres on the relationship between Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd and Continental Cablevision of the United States, who are also Optus Vision shareholders.</p>
<p>Continental, which has recently merged with U.S. West, has 46.5 percent of Optus Vision.</p>
