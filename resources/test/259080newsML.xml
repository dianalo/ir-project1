<p>U.N. refugee chief Sadako Ogata said on Monday that involuntary repatriation of some groups of Bosnians to their shattered country could not be excluded.</p>
<p>"The principle of voluntary repatriation is the principle that everybody prefers," Ogata, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, told a news conference after a humanitarian meeting on former Yugoslavia in Geneva.</p>
<p>"However, when the conditions on the ground have improved in a way that for certain categories of people return is possible, then involuntary return is not excluded," she said. "This is the way that I think the legal interpretation should be made."</p>
<p>Germany, which is host to 320,000 refugees from the conflict, this month deported 24 people. It signed an agreement with Bosnia last month allowing for repatriation and said it hoped many would soon start returning of their own free will.</p>
<p>A year after the U.S.-brokered Dayton peace accord ended 43 months of war in Bosnia, only 250,000 of the 2.1 million uprooted Bosnians have returned home, despite the right to return being central to the peace treaty.</p>
<p>Most are blocked from returning by the failure of the international community to push separatist leaders, mainly in Serb and Croat areas, to stop ethnic intolerance and harassment.</p>
<p>Ogata called for a mass return of Bosnians by spring to areas where they are the ethnic majority. She later acknowledged her agency expected just 260,000 Bosnians living in Western Europe, Croatia and Serbia to go home in 1997.</p>
<p>UNHCR says another 200,000 people displaced within Bosnia may return to their communities of origin next year, although Ogata said the figure might be "rather optimistic".</p>
<p>Ogata said security would have to improve before minorities could go home.</p>
<p>She appealed to European host countries to continue providing temporary protection to Bosnian refugees from minority areas, couples in ethnically-mixed marriages as well as former detainees and victims of extreme violence.</p>
<p>"There are many who can and should now go back to rebuild their lives," Ogata said.</p>
<p>"But there are other categories whose return home will depend first of all on the removal of political barriers but also on more vigorous efforts on the part of all actors on the ground."</p>
<p>U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for European Affairs, John Kornblum, told the meeting that much remained to be done under the Dayton accord.</p>
<p>Kornblum said more than 90,000 people had fled their homes since the deal was signed and repatriation of Bosnian refugees had been well below initial hopes for 870,000 returnees by now.</p>
<p>"The primary obstacle to return has been the threat to personal security," he told the meeting, also blasting Croatia's leaders for failing to protect ethnic minority returnees.</p>
<p>"Croatian authorities have failed to protect the victims and have often perpetrated the crimes," he said.</p>
<p>Angelo Gnaedinger, in charge of Western and Central Europe and the Balkans at the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), echoed Ogata's views that the peace process was fragile.</p>
<p>"At the political level, progress is slow...Those who want to go back of their own free will should be given all necessary support, however, nobody should be compelled to do so," he said.</p>
