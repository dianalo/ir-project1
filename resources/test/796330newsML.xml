<p>Cuban President Fidel Castro turned 71 on Wednesday after 38 years in power, an occasion marked by low-key homages in the country's state-run media.</p>
<p>Castro, still a defiant guardian of communism and an enduring irritant to the United States, was not expected to make any public appearances on his birthday, traditionally marked with official discretion.</p>
<p>The Communist Party newspaper, Granma, published a journalist's brief account of accompanying Castro a year ago on a visit to the Cuban leader's birthplace, a farm in Biran in the east of the country.</p>
<p>The reporter wrote that the "head of the most worthy, strong and heroic revolution in modern times" was celebrating his birthday on Wednesday "with the love of all the people."</p>
<p>State radio station Radio Rebelde also recalled last year's trip to Biran, with an emotional reporter recounting every detail.</p>
<p>But the national news agency, Prensa Latina, said while there had been some fanfare for Castro's 70th birthday, this year Cuba was returning to the "habitual restraint" that surrounds the event.</p>
<p>Such restraint is encouraged by Castro, who, while he may dominate Cuba's political scene, keeps his private life a closed book and is said to spurn the cult of personality. Last year he sought to give the impression that try as he might, he could not prevent people from paying tribute.</p>
<p>Last year state media published lengthy homages, and Castro was invited to a birthday party by the Young Pioneers, Cuba's children's club, where he beamingly cut a cake.</p>
<p>Castro, who still sports his trademark beard and almost invariably dresses in military fatigues, has been quieter than usual lately, at least in public.</p>
<p>A polished orator since he led his rebel army out of the mountains to topple dictator Fulgencio Batista in January 1959, Castro has not given a public speech since early in April.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, he has appeared at several key events but has not made a speech and has looked tired on some occasions, leading to speculation in some quarters that he may be ill.</p>
<p>But Castro has lapsed into periodic public silences in the past. And state television showed him on Saturday speaking the previous evening with Cuban journalists, lamenting the fate of the former communist countries of the old Soviet bloc.</p>
<p>Castro, who heads Cuba's Council of State and is also First Secretary of the Communist Party, has given no indication he intends to retire.</p>
<p>While forced to make some cautious economic reforms as Cuba plunged into crisis after the demise of the Soviet Union, the Cuban leader has repeatedly vowed he will not take the island down the road to capitalism.</p>
