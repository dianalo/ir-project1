<p>French telecommunications company Alcatel Alsthom has won the tender to install the first cellular phone network in Mozambique in a deal worth $9.6 million, the official Mozambique News Agency reported on Wednesday.  </p>
<p>This first network will cover the southern region, including the cities of Maputo, Matola and Xai-Xai, and the roads from Maputo to the South African and Swaziland borders.</p>
<p>The contract is for the supply and installation of the network, which should start operating in June, the agency said.</p>
<p>The network will have capacity for 10,000 subscribers.</p>
<p>Studies will start this year into the viability of extending the cellular phone network to Beira, in the central province of Sofala, and to Tete, in the west, the agency said.</p>
