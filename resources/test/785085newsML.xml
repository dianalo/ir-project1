<title>USA: Microsoft co-founder Allen sells part of stake.</title>

<p>Microsoft Corp. co-founder Paul Allen has sold more than $700 million of stock in the software giant to fund other investments including his purchase of the Seattle Seahawks football team, officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>Allen has sold 5.45 million shares of Microsoft over the past several weeks to fund "a variety of investments that are contemplated or already have been agreed to," said Bill Savoy, president of Allen's Vulcan Ventures Inc.</p>
<p>At Microsoft's recent average stock price of about $140, the sales would have brought in some $763 million, less commissions.</p>
<p>While Allen has sold stock nearly every quarter since the company went public in 1986, the sales in the latest period were by far a record for the technology mogul.</p>
<p>Part of the money is going to pay for the Seahawks, which Allen recently purchased for a reported $200 million. Allen also has committed up to $100 million toward a new football stadium that will be funded mostly through taxes.</p>
<p>Even after the sale Allen retains about 100 million shares of Microsoft, a stake of nearly 9 percent, worth more than $14 billion and good enough for third place on the latest Forbes magazine list of the wealthiest Americans.</p>
