<p>Super 12 champions Auckland ended their brief European tour in style with a crushing 47-11 win over European Cup winners Brive of France on Saturday.</p>
<p>"It was like spending 80 minutes in a washing machine," Brive captain Alain Penaud said after the New Zealand side ran in six tries to one.</p>
<p>Brive officials had dubbed the game an "unofficial world club championship" but it turned into a rugby lesson which highlighted once again the superiority of sides from the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The Auckland Blues were simply stronger, faster, more skilled technically, more cunning strategically and they hardly made any mistakes.</p>
<p>Centre Lee Stensness led the Auckland charge with a hat-trick of tries, while Adrian Cashmore kicked 14 points, landing four conversions and two penalties.</p>
<p>"It was like being run over by a bus a hundred times," said Penaud. "The 101st time, the tackling gets a bit clumsy."</p>
<p>Auckland now travel to South Africa to begin their Super 12 campaign.</p>
