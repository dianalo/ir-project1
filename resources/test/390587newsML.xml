<p>The IPE natural gas futures market saw a late burst of activity on Thursday, with 100 lots changing hands in the last minute before the market closed, out of a total of only 230 traded all day .</p>
<p>The total was disappointing after record volumes had been set on both Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Only 90 lots had traded in the morning session, and until one minute before the market closed, only 40 lots had traded all afternoon, but the late rally in activity took the total to a respectable volume by the close, brokers said.</p>
<p>"It's been thin because of people with sore heads after two nights of partying," said one, referring to the week of industry events in London.</p>
<p>Prices in the front months, March and April, fell sharply, with March breaking resistance at 10.00 pence a therm to trade as low as 9.90 pence in the final trade, down 0.790 pence a therm from Wednesday's settlement.</p>
<p>April last traded at 10.10 pence, down 0.645 pence from the previous settlement.</p>
<p>June, July and August were steady to marginally firmer, with the three months last traded at parity at 10.15 pence a therm.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, this put the forward curve in contango from March through to the summer. August, when demand is at a seasonal low, is now at a premium to March, at the tail end of the winter.</p>
<p>But a broker was dismissive of the significance of individual month's price movements given how little was traded.</p>
<p>"It's basically flat from March through to August," he said.</p>
