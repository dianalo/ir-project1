<title>GREECE: New way out for Greek conscientious objectors.</title>

<p>The Greek parliament has passed a law offering conscientious objectors an alternative to military service for the first time, parliamentary officials said on Friday.</p>
<p>The 300-seat house passed the law by a majority vote late on Thursday. The estimated 2,500 Greek objectors will serve their time in the public sector.</p>
<p>They will be able to work in public hospitals or municipal services for about double the 19-month regular military service period.</p>
<p>Human rights groups have called the extended period for alternative service for conscientious objectors punitive and called on the government to shorten it.</p>
<p>Military courts often jail conscientious objectors -- about 300 of them are in prison now -- and international human rights groups had strongly criticised the country for providing no alternative to military service.</p>
<p>Most of those in jail are Jehovah's Witnesses who present themselves to military authorities but refuse to bear arms on religious grounds.</p>
<p>Most of the other conscientious objectors are Greeks who simply fail to show up for military service and are dodging authorities.</p>
