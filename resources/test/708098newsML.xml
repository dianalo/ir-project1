<p>A Bosnian refugee confessed on Friday that he had hijacked an Austrian Airlines plane flying from Berlin to Vienna in January but insisted he merely wanted to secure a German residency permit.</p>
<p>Salko Loncaric, testifying on the first day of his trial on hostage-taking charges, also said he had been emotionally disturbed and under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p>"I never physically endangered anyone," he said. "I am really not a dangerous man. If the pilot had been a little bit more courageous, he could have just kept flying."</p>
<p>Loncaric, 40, forced the pilot at knifepoint to return to Berlin and also demanded to speak to German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel about a residency permit.</p>
<p>The January 7 incident ended peacefully when police boarded the plane and pushed Loncaric out of an open door onto the tarmac. He fell about seven metres (yards) and was quickly overpowered and detained.</p>
<p>Loncaric said he had been carrying a kitchen knife in his jacket, a 45 cm (18 inch) long wooden baton in his waistband and another bat in his carry-on luggage.</p>
<p>"I thought the officials at security would have stopped me and taken the knife and the bat," he told the court.</p>
<p>The incident prompted a security probe at the western Berlin airport, which had enjoyed a reputation for thoroughness since the Cold War era.</p>
<p>Officials from the airport's private security company have said Loncaric was thoroughly searched but no weapons were found. They did, however, discover he was carrying 50 cigarette lighters, of which they confiscated 45.</p>
<p>About 320,000 Bosnian refugees lived in Germany before several German states began their forced repatriation after the 43-month-long war there ended. Loncaric's residency permit was set to expire the week after the hijacking.</p>
<p>"The economic situation in Bosnia now is very bad," he told the court through an interpreter. "I was looking for a good solution to my problem of not having residency and work papers."</p>
<p>The plane, a McDonnell-Douglas MD-80, was only one-quarter full, with 28 passengers and five crew members. The passengers included Germans, Austrians and Japanese.</p>
<p>Loncaric faces a sentence of between five and 10 years in prison for hostage-taking and air piracy.</p>
