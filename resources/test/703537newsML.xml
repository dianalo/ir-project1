<p>Australia's immigration minister must release government documents used to refuse Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams entry to the country based on his association with the IRA, a court ruled on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Federal court judge Doug Drummond ruled that Adams, who has launched a court challenge after being denied a visa, should have access to the government documents.</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock refused Adams a business visa last November because of his "intimate association" with the Irish Republican Arny, which is fighting to oust Britain from Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>Ruddock also said Adams was not a person of good character.</p>
<p>Adams, leader of the IRA's political wing, had applied in October for a visa to enter Australia to promote his autobiography "Before the Dawn".</p>
<p>Adams' court challenge to the visa decision is expected to be heard later this year.</p>
<p>But his Australian lawyer has said that government documents already gained through freedom of information laws, such as one from the country's main intelligence body which covers domestic security, do not support Ruddock's decision.</p>
<p>Solicitor Terry Fisher told Reuters that a document from the Australian Secret Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) did not oppose Adams visiting Australia.</p>
<p>The document dated October 29, 1996, said: "ASIO does not recommend against the issue of a visa for Mr Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the terrorist organisation the Political Irish Republican Army (PIRA)".</p>
<p>Fisher would not release the ASIO document.</p>
<p>"What we are saying is that the freedom of information document gives no evidence how he (the minister) reached his conculsion," said Fisher, who is a member of the Australian Aid for Ireland which raises funds for the families of IRA members deemed to be political prisoners in Northern Ireland.</p>
