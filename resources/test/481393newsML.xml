<p>A strike by stevedores is costing the Brazilian port of Santos 1.2 million reais (US$1.14 million) per day in delayed revenues, officials said.</p>
<p>"The port authority Codesp has revenues of 1.2 million reais per day at this time of year and these will be delayed," a spokeswoman for the port authority said.</p>
<p>The owners of ships were losing an average of 15,000 reais per day on ships that were not loading, she added.</p>
<p>Stevedores represent around half the workers at the port, she said. They went on strike at 0700 local/1000 GMT over a ruling which allows company workers from Cosipe to conduct loading and unloading at Cosipe's private terminal at the port.</p>
<p>The strike has stopped the loading and unloading of most commodities at the port. There are 21 vessels currently docked at the port, 17 at the port authority's terminal and four at private terminals. All but three are paralyzed.</p>
<p>Of the vessels, two were waiting to load soybeans, eight were container vessels, three fertilizer, two wheat, one sulphur and the rest unspecified cargo.</p>
<p>The strike is scheduled to last 48 hours and will spread to the national level on Friday, the National Stevedores' Federation said.</p>
