<p>NYMEX Henry Hub natgas futures mostly ended higher Friday in a moderate session, but technical selling and softer weekend cash prices ahead of milder weather left August with a slight loss, sources said.</p>
<p>August eased 0.7 cent to close at $2.168 per million British thermal units. September settled one cent higher at $2.142. Other deferreds ended up by one-half to 0.7 cent.</p>
<p>"August failed to get over $2.19 which set off some technical selling, and the cash was down and that was surprising with nearly three bcfd off the market," said one Midwest trader, referring to U.S. Gulf production shut ins due to Hurricane Danny.</p>
<p>The following pipelines reported production cuts Thursday and Friday because of Hurricane Danny:</p>
<p>- Columbia Gulf - 270 mmcfd</p>
<p>- ANR Pipeline - 125-150 mmcfd</p>
<p>- Transco - 250 mmcfd</p>
<p>- Tennessee - 500 mmcfd</p>
<p>- Trunkline - 200 mmcfd</p>
<p>- Texas Eastern - 200-300 mmcfd</p>
<p>- Stingray - 71 mmcfd</p>
<p>- Sonat - 380 mmcfd (includes Sea Robin)</p>
<p>Total Reported - 2,121 mmcfd</p>
<p>But most of the pipeline operators said they expected lost production to be restored over the weekend.</p>
<p>Separately, NGC's Venice gas processing plant was shut this morning due to high water from the storm. The plant, which typically receives about 750 mmcfd of offshore gas production, was expected back in service in two days.</p>
<p>With milder weather forecast for next week and hurricane fears on the wane, most expected the market to start next week on the defensive though some said stepped up storage demand could limit any weakness.</p>
<p>Danny was upgraded to a hurricane last night when sustained winds exceeded 74 mph.</p>
<p>At 1400 EDT, the storm was located at latitude 29.6 north, longitude 89.1 west, or about 60 miles east-southeast of New Orleans, moving northeast at about five mph with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph.</p>
<p>Danny was on track to make landfall in the next 24 hours somewhere on the Mississippi/Alabama coast.</p>
<p>Chart traders still pegged key August resistance at the down trendline at $2.22-2.23. Most agreed the spot contract needed to close above that level to turn sentiment more bullish. Further resistance was seen at $2.29 and $2.36. Support was pegged at $2.15 and then at last week's low of $2.051.</p>
<p>In the cash Friday, Gulf Coast weekend prices slipped a couple of cents to the low-$2.20s. Midcon pipes were off three cents to the $2.09-2.14 area. New York city gate gas lost about a nickel to the mid-$2.50s.</p>
<p>The NYMEX Henry Hub 12-month strip gained one-half cent to $2.215. NYMEX said 31,164 contracts traded, down from Thursday's revised tally of 45,732.</p>
<p>On the KCBT, August finished down 0.2 cent at $2.078, while deferreds ended steady to one cent lower. The East/West spread narrowed by 0.5 cent to 9.0 cents (NYMEX premium). KCBT said 315 contracts traded, down from Thursday's total of 486.</p>
