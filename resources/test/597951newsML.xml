<p>Shanghai copper futures ended down on Tuesday with selling from big copper producers weakening market sentiment, traders said.</p>
<p>The most actively traded September 1997 contract ended at 23,780 yuan ($2,868) per tonne, losing 110 yuan. It opened at an intraday high of 23,850 and hit a low of 23,730 yuan per tonne.</p>
<p>June fell 70 yuan to 23,380, July 90 to 23,540, August 120 to 23,680 and October 100 to 23,800.</p>
<p>Combined volume fell to 34,700 tonnes from 46,440 tonnes.</p>
<p>Copper opened slightly lower and fell further for most of the session.  </p>
<p>Traders said investors were unwilling to buy due to a lack of news in favour of long position holders, but lower physical copper prices encouraged selling by big producers.</p>
<p>They said investors could not see any upward momentum and so prefered to stay on the sidelines. This led to the fall in trading volume.</p>
<p>"Retail investors dominated today's trade," a trader said.</p>
<p>The price of physical copper is around 23,300 yuan in the Shanghai area, traders said.</p>
<p>Any show of strength on the London Metal Exchange (LME) would help boost local interest in buying, traders said.  </p>
<p>But they said they expected to see copper producers build short positions at the key resistance level of 24,000 yuan.</p>
<p>A small stock drawdown of 475 tonnes on the LME on Tuesday saw the red metal soften in early trade below $2,470, with support seen around $2,440-$2450 per tonne.</p>
<p>Shanghai trade sources said local copper should move in a range of 23,500-24,000 yuan per tonne in the next few days.</p>
<p>Aluminium ended down. June fell 60 yuan to 15,450, July 210 to 15,600, August 50 to 15,800, and September 150 to 15,950.</p>
<p>Combined volume rose to 1,890 tonnes from 1,280 tonnes.</p>
