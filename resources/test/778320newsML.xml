<p>Private Norwegian shipping investment firm Sjoinvest has called for an extraordinary general meeting of shareholders in Western Bulk Shipping at which it plans to propose the election of an undisclosed number of new directors.</p>
<p>The call intensifies the tussle between Sjoinvest and Belships Company Ltd Ships-ASA for control of Western Bulk, which operates one of the world's largest fleets of handymax bulk carriers through its Western Bulk Carriers pool.</p>
<p>Sjoinvest managing director Malvin Kleppe told Reuters on Tuesday he hoped the meeting would be called within the next fortnight.</p>
<p>"We have called for an extraordinary general meeting, which we are entitled to do, at which we intend to propose changes to the board of directors," Kleppe said.</p>
<p>"We are unhappy with the situation at present and are waiting for Western Bulk to name the date," he said.</p>
<p>He declined to reveal who or how many names would be put forward.</p>
<p>Belships managing director Sverre Tidemand admitted that he feared his company would lose its effective control of Western Bulk.</p>
<p>He said: "I am not very happy with this, as you can imagine. We will have to see what they come up with."</p>
<p>"If they have good ideas for the company, then I hope that I may have something to offer," added Tidemand, who is also chairman of bulk shipowner association Intercargo.</p>
<p>Belships and associated family interests have a 42 percent stake in Western Bulk. Both firms have close historic ties through Norway's Tidemand and Lorentzen shipping families.</p>
<p>Sjoinvest, which is owned by investor Pal Caspersen, has recently acquired a 26 percent stake in Western Bulk.</p>
<p>A further a 18 percent stake held by Norwegian engineering group Kvaerner ASA. That stake may be sold as part of Kvaerner's drive to focus on core investments.</p>
<p>Tidemand added: "It looks likely Sjoinvest will have a controlling say at any meeting since it is apparent they have the support of Kvaerner in this."</p>
