<p>A corruption probe that has shocked Italy with the arrest of its state railways chief accelerated on Tuesday when at least five more people were arrested, judicial sources said.</p>
<p>Italian news agencies, quoting judicial sources, said the arrests included the managing director of an arms company and two magistrates, but gave no details of charges.</p>
<p>They said the arrests were requested by magistrates in La Spezia, a coastal town in northwest Italy, who on Sunday jailed Ferrovie dello Stato (FS) managing director Lorenzo Necci, one of Italy's most prominent public sector executives.</p>
<p>Investigating magistrate Alberto Cardino confirmed that further arrests had been made and said they were part of the same probe. He declined to comment further.</p>
<p>Newspapers on Tuesday splashed Necci's arrest across their front pages and declared that the "Tangentopoli" (Bribesville) scandal which brought down Italy's political and business elite several years ago was still alive.</p>
<p>"Tangentopoli Re-explodes," read the banner headline in the respected newspaper Corriere della Sera, referring to thousands of graft investigations, beginning in 1992, which showed that bribes-for-public contracts was business as usual in Italy.</p>
<p>Such luminaries as former prime minister Bettino Craxi, party leaders and business barons were caught in the scandal and two of Italy's stalwart political parties, the Christian Democrats and Socialists, disbanded.</p>
<p>Necci has been overseeing plans to build a high-speed rail network, a multi-billion-dollar public works project which will be one of Europe's largest once set into motion.</p>
<p>Magistrates said they would question Necci on Wednesday on suspicion of involvement in a host of crimes including fraud, embezzlement, false accounting, corruption and abuse of office.</p>
<p>Italian news agencies quoted judicial sources as saying that Pier Francesco Guarguaglini, managing director of the La Spezia-based arms producer Oto Melara, was among those detained on Tuesday and that he had been released into house arrest.</p>
<p>They said others included Roberto Napolitano, a magistrate in the Tuscan town of Grosseto who is already suspended from his duties in a separate case, and Orazio Savia, magistrate in the central town of Cassino.</p>
<p>Media reports have said judicial sources indicate that the probe focuses on suspected bribes for lucrative rail contracts.</p>
<p>Necci was being held in a solitary cell at the jail in La Spezia, where La Stampa newspaper said he could catch a glimpse of railroad tracks from his window. Two businessmen and a secretary arrested with Necci also were being held there.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Romano Prodi acknowledged Necci's arrest was "worrying for the image" of Italy, but insisted his centre-left government, elected in April, was not touched.</p>
<p>"The activities of the company will not suffer any interference or any delay," he told reporters in Valencia, Spain, where he was attending an Italian-Spanish summit.</p>
<p>Necci's arrest was not the first time scandal touched the railroad. In 1988, the whole board resigned in the so-called "Golden Sheets Affair" which revealed that FS paid $110 million simply for linen and paper sheets for its sleeper service.</p>
<p>Necci also had previously come under magistrates' scrutiny in connection with the ill-fated Enimont chemicals joint venture of which he was president between 1989 and 1990. He was one of few officers spared indictment.</p>
<p>Magistrates charge that companies spent tens of millions of dollars in bribes to political parties to extricate themselves from the disastrous venture between agro-chemicals company Montedison and state energy group ENI.</p>
