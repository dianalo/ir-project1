<p>The United States would consider some form of peaceful nuclear cooperation with China even before a previously signed accord is fully implemented, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"As we move forward on nuclear non-proliferation, the U.S. is prepared to consider, as consistent with U.S. laws, further steps in the area of peaceful nuclear cooperation even in advance of our full implementation of the 1985 agreement," Christopher told a news conference in Beijing.  </p>
<p>"If they (the Chinese) are making progress towards putting the 1985 agreement into effect, we are prepared to consider other things," Christopher said.</p>
<p>The United States has held up a 1985 agreement on peaceful nuclear cooperation because of concerns over Beijing's nuclear sales although the two sides have recently begun talks aimed at allowing the accord to proceed.</p>
<p>China is eager to buy billions of dollars worth of nuclear power reactors from U.S. firms.</p>
<p>Christopher arrived on Tuesday for a three-day visit that included meetings with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng.</p>
