<p>Singapore shares reversed losses in late afternoon trading on Wednesday as retail punters chased Malaysian over-the-counter shares.</p>
<p>"The market just started moving again following Malaysia. I think the market was a bit oversold," said a broker with a local firm. The UOB-OTC index ended sharply higher at 1,329.97, up 16.54 points.</p>
<p>Soft drinks group Fraser &amp; Neave slumped to a new year low of S$12.50 (US$8.74), down 40 cents. "People are disenchanted with F&amp;N. Its property earnings are drying up and drinks side is facing a lot of start up costs," said an analyst at a foreign firm.</p>
<p>The benchmark Straits Times Industrial index ended up 3.09 points at 2,192.53. Total market volume was 342 million shares with 269 gainers against 118 losers.</p>
<p>Topping the actives was newly-listed Omni Industries which ended at S$0.76 against its offer price of S$0.45.</p>
<p>OUB Bank foreign topped the gainers list with a 40 cent rise to end at S$11.10. Dealers said the sell-down at the start of the week over the bank's exposure to Thai banks was unwarranted.</p>
<p>DBS Bank foreign ended down 30 cents to S$18.10 ahead the release of its results on Thursday.</p>
<p>US$1.00=S$1.43</p>
