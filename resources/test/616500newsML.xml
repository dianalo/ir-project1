<p>Finance Minister Jose Antonio Ocampo denied a published report Tuesday claiming that official figures showed Colombia's economy suffered negative growth of 1.26 percent during the first quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>"I don't think the first quarter was as bad as is reflected in these figures," Ocampo said in an interview with the Radionet news network.  A report in Bogota's El Espectador newspaper attributed the first quarter figure for GDP growth to senior Planning Department officials. But Ocampo said the source of the figure was unknown and insisted there were still not enough data to give an accurate read-out on Q1 growth.  </p>
<p>"It's really impossible, with the information available so far, to precisely calculate first quarter growth," he said.</p>
<p>He noted, among other things, that there had been no official figures for industrial output since January and no figures for retail and wholesale sales since February. Additionally, he said there had been no official estimates for agricultural production -- with the exception of the coffee sector -- since last year.</p>
<p>Gross Domestic Product growth was two percent last year, one of the lowest figures in a decade, according to still preliminary Planning Department figures.</p>
