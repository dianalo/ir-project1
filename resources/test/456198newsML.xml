<p>Malaysian shares closed lower as investors locked in profits posted on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Analysts said trading was likely to remain choppy until after the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) interest rate policy meeting next Tuesday.</p>
<p>"People are waiting for the FOMC meeting to get out of the way though some have discounted it," said an analyst with a foreign brokerage house. "The market is still attractive."</p>
<p>The benchmark Composite Index of 100 large-capitalised stocks ended down 8.84 points at 1,225.99, while the all-share EMAS index closed 2.58 points lower at 359.17.  </p>
<p>Market volume stood at 376 million shares, compared with 405 million on Wednesday. Losers overwhelmed gainers 509 to 135.</p>
<p>United Engineers fell 70 cents to 22.30 ringgit. After the close, the company announced a net profit of 513.2 million ringgit, up 90 percent from the previous year.</p>
<p>Trenergy dropped 35 cents to 9.60 ringgit on profit-taking. The stock had risen over the past week on speculation that the company had won an oil and gas contract in an eastern Malaysian state.</p>
