<p>A major Mexican banking group, Serfin, fired one its top analysts for organising a teleconference with foreign investors in which a fiery opposition congressman was to be the sole speaker, bank officials said.</p>
<p>The firing underscores the depth of political sensitivity in Mexico, which has been ruled for 67 years by one party.</p>
<p>John Green, chief Serfin analyst in New York, was dismissed after he sought to stage an investor teleconference with independent deputy Adolfo Aguilar Zinser without due authorisation.</p>
<p>Green "organized an event of a political nature without seeking authorisation from the executive committee. He was not allowed to do that, the policy of the group is very clear on that," Grupo Financiero Serfin spokesman Roberto Aguirre said late Tuesday.</p>
<p>In an interview with Reuters, Aguilar Zinser accused the government of pressuring the troubled bank to cancel the conference, a charge denied by Serfin.</p>
<p>Serfin did, however, cancel the conference at the last moment. "If we'd have organised something like this, it would have to have other points of view. A good teleconference has to have a plurality of views," a Serfin source said.</p>
<p>Aguilar Zinser said he was contacted the night before the Nov. 8 conference call by a Serfin official in Mexico City who told him the briefing was unauthorised. Later, when he contacted Green, he was told it had been called off.</p>
<p>"I have received the version that the cancellation was in the most energetic and angry terms and that it was ordered by the (Finance Ministry) Hacienda," the deputy said.</p>
<p>A Finance Ministry spokesman said the ministry had no comment on the allegations. "We don't intervene in the internal decisions of any bank," he said.</p>
<p>Aguilar Zinser, a strident opponent of the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, has been one of the main thorns in the side of the government in Congress during the almost two-year rule of President Ernesto Zedillo.</p>
<p>He said he was planning to tell investors that next year, when Mexico goes through what are expected to be critical mid-term elections, the going will be tough.</p>
