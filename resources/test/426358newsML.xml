<p>The Russian government, savaged by President Boris Yeltsin for its failure to cope with an economic crisis that was driving people to despair, is to be extensively overhauled.</p>
<p>"There will be a series of changes in the coming days,", Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said on Thursday. Criticisms in Yeltsin's annual state of the nation address delivered on Thursday were merited, he added. The changes would be significant.</p>
<p>Kremlin sources said Anatoly Chubais, Yeltsin's liberal chief-of-staff, is likely to be parachuted in by the president as Chernomyrdin's number two, taking sole responsibility as first deputy prime minister for supervising economic reforms.</p>
<p>Interfax news agency said Yeltsin, whose speech on Thursday confirmed both his ability and determination to rule again after eight months of illness, could sign a decree appointing the 41-year-old administrator to the post on Friday.</p>
<p>Chernomyrdin refused to name names. But he called Chubais, who spearheaded Russia's privatisation campaign, a "high-calibre economist" who would be an asset to the government.</p>
<p>The 58-year-old prime minister, who has kept his job through more than one storm of complaint from Yeltsin over the past four years or so, indicated he would restructure the cabinet in a way that Chubais and other reformers called for last August.</p>
<p>Then, after Yeltsin's re-election in a campaign masterminded by Chubais, Chernomyrdin divided government responsibilities into separate broad spheres under three first deputies.</p>
<p>His latest comments reinforced expectations that he will streamline his team under a single economic supremo -- Chubais.</p>
<p>"The whole approach must be economic," Chernomyrdin said.</p>
<p>The communist speaker of the State Duma lower house said on Thursday night he was "99 percent certain" Chubais would get the government number two job and that it would be "a tragedy".</p>
<p>"Many people already want the government to resign. Now they will call for that even more loudly," Gennady Seleznyov told reporters. "Many people who are suffering now believe it is all the fault of Chubais's privatisation programme."</p>
<p>In practice, parliament has little power to overrule the president's choice of government. But Seleznyov warned that Yeltsin had given Russia's disenchanted workers a new set of slogans for a threatened general strike on March 27.</p>
<p>The 66-year-old president demanded an end to delays in paying pensions and wages -- a source of misery for millions. One homeless man expressed his despair by setting himself alight on Red Square, outside the Kremlin, shortly after Yeltsin spoke.</p>
<p>"Enough is enough...The time has come to restore order and I will do that," Yeltsin said. But he has promised that before.</p>
<p>Clearly already thinking of his place in history, he reminded parliament he would step down in the year 2000.</p>
<p>"I want to pass on to my successor...a country whose people look to the future with confidence," he said.</p>
<p>It seems he may now be counting on Chubais to oblige.</p>
<p>Yeltsin will turn his attention to foreign policy on Friday, when he meets Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko.</p>
<p>Promising "great decisions for Russia and Belarus", Yeltsin said deepening integration with the friendliest of the former Soviet states would be his foreign policy priority this year.</p>
<p>His spokesman said on Thursday that Lukashenko's visit would be the occasion for "serious, detailed talks" on integration.</p>
<p>NATO, whose expansion into eastern Europe earned another blast of criticism from Yeltsin on Thursday, may find the prospect of Moscow again embracing westerly Belarus troubling.</p>
<p>Lukashenko's fiercely pro-Russian stance enjoys wide support but, in a move to clamp down on nationalist opposition, the hardline Belarus leader announced heavy penalties on Thursday for unauthorised demonstrations and use of nationalist emblems.</p>
