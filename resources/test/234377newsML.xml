<p>White House adviser George Stephanopoulos, who is leaving the Clinton administration for a university teaching job, said on Wednesday he may run for political office some day.</p>
<p>"It's something I want to think about," he told a news conference at Columbia University, where he will teach political science next year. Asked if he had political aspirations, he said, "I certainly haven't ruled it out."</p>
<p>In addition to teaching, Stephanopoulos, 35, said he planned to work in television and write a book after he leaves his White House job.</p>
<p>At Columbia, where he earned an undergraduate degree in political science in 1982, he will be a visiting professor for two years, teaching seminars, delivering lectures and holding informal "town meetings" with students. He will focus on politics, policy, the press and the presidency, he said.</p>
<p>After helping in President Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign, Stephanopoulos became White House communications director and briefly served as the president's spokesman. As senior adviser behind the scenes, he has been a Clinton confidant and worked closely with members of Congress.</p>
<p>Stephanopoulos' boyish good looks also made him a bit of a celebrity. Asked by a reporter how he felt about becoming one of New York City's most eligible bachelors, he laughed and refused to comment.</p>
