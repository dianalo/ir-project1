<p>Arizona Gov. Fife Symington on Tuesday proposed a $5.1 billion state budget for fiscal year 1998 that included a $100 million income tax cut and a $90 million funding boost for public schools.</p>
<p>The governor said his $100 million cut would reduce taxes for all Arizonans by at least 6.8 percent.</p>
<p>"This latest cut would continue the trend toward our goal of reducing the burden of government on the working people of this state," Symington said.  </p>
<p>Kindergarten through grade 12 schools would receive the largest budget increase, up $90.4 million over fiscal year 1997, the governor said. The budget proposal also included $10 million for the first year of a phased-in voucher system, expected to reach more than 6,700 students in the first year.</p>
<p>Symington said he would give the state's universities their largest budget increase in seven years, $43.3 million.</p>
<p>For welfare programs, the governor said he planned to spend $187.6 million of the $226.4 million expected to come from Arizona's share of federal block grants. He said remaining funds would be deposited in a "rainy day" fund.  </p>
<p>Symington recommended that the state spend $28 million for state employee merit pay raises and adjustments. His plan would also provide funding for several air quality programs and $12 million to open an 800 bed state prison in Yuma.</p>
<p>"This budget continues to make more with less," he said. "It recognizes and respects the taxpayers ability to spend their money better than government and directs state resources where they are needed the most."</p>
<p>In the past six years, the state has enacted more than $2.5 billion in tax relief, the governor said.</p>
