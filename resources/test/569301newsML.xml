<headline>Mexico's SCT releases long-distance guidelines.</headline>
<dateline>MEXICO CITY 1997-05-07</dateline>
<text>
<p>The Communications and Transport Ministry (SCT) unveiled on Wednesday guidelines for government departments to follow when selecting carriers in Mexico's recently deregulated long distance telephone department.</p>
<p>"Contracting shall be done following a restricted invitation procedure, with the participation of each and every carrier with a concession in the public telecommunications network that includes long-distance services," the SCT said in Wednesday's edition of the Mexican Official Gazette.</p>
<p>The SCT added that "the contract will be awarded in favor of whichever concessionary offers the lowest price."</p>
<p>Bids may be called for as of May 8, by all federal government offices in areas where the long-distance market has been opened to competition, such as Monterrey, Guadalajara, Queretaro and Mexico City.</p>
<p>The guidelines do not cover local telephone carriers, cellular telephones, cable television, pay television, individual and fleet paging, private or maritime radio communication or private band radio.</p>
