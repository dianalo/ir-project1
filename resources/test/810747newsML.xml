<p>When journalists die violently in Latin America no one seems to care. Corruption and ineptitude block official investigations. The killers and those who gave the orders to kill remain free.</p>
<p>Those were among the conclusions on Friday of the annual conference of the Interamerican Press Association (IAPA) following three days of meetings focusing on the unpunished murders of journalists.</p>
<p>"There is a lack of consistent public outrage. ... We have found that impunity is the rule and not the exception," IAPA Vice President Oliver Clarke said in a speech at the closing of the conference.</p>
<p>At least 169 journalists were murdered in the Americas in the last seven years, and almost none of the cases have been solved, IAPA said.</p>
<p>Clarke, of the Jamaican newspaper The Daily Gleamer, said violence against journalists had not stopped and may even have increased in countries enjoying new democratic governments.</p>
<p>Publishers from across the hemisphere called on governments to open up closed files and get to the bottom of these deaths.</p>
<p>"We urge that governments complete full investigations of crimes against journalists," said a document of recommendations drafted at the conference.</p>
<p>Participants in the conference heard wrenching testimony from family members of six journalists killed in Guatemala, Mexico and Colombia.</p>
<p>Marta de Carpio said her husband, Guatemalan politician and newspaperman Jorge Carpio, died in her arms after 30 armed men ambushed them on a country road in July 1993. She said she knows it was a hit because she still remembers one of them yelling, "kill Jorge, kill Carpio."</p>
<p>But the "police kept insisting it was a common crime," de Carpio said bitterly.</p>
<p>Eight different judges have passed the case around like a hot potato, files have been lost and false evidence presented and then destroyed, de Carpio said.</p>
<p>Former Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro, widow of a slain newspaper editor, was visibly moved as she heard de Carpio's story.</p>
<p>Chamorro was part of a commission of notables, including politicians, judges, media chief and other influential Latin Americans, that listened to the testimony and helped draft recommendations at the conclusion of the conference.</p>
<p>Witnesses also gave testimony on the cases of five other slain journalists: Colombians Guillermo Cano Isaza, murdered in 1986, and Carlos Lajud Catalan, killed in 1993; Guatemalan Irma Flaquer Azurdia, who disappeared in 1980; and Mexicans Hector Felix Miranda, killed in 1988, and Victor Manuel Oropeza, murdered in 1991.</p>
