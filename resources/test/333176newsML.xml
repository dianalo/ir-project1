<p>German Finance Minister Theo Waigel on Saturday defended a controversial tax reform plan against a barrage of criticism from within and outside Chancellor Helmut Kohl's ruling centre-right coalition.</p>
<p>Waigel, in an interview with the weekly news magazine Focus, said now the government has presented its plan for billions of marks in tax cuts beginning in 1999 it was up to industry to do its part to create jobs.</p>
<p>"The tax reform is a growth programme for industry and for more jobs," he said. "The entrepreneur must consider that it is good for him to invest now and from 1999 pay fewer taxes on profits."</p>
<p>The government coalition last week approved the tax plan, which sharply lowers income tax rates and cuts taxes by some 82 billion marks.  The plan would also slash tax breaks, bringing the total amount of tax cuts to 44 billion marks.</p>
<p>With an eye to reining in budget deficits in order to qualify for Europe's planned single currency, Waigel wants to raise value-added tax (VAT) by one point to 16 percent to pay for tax reform, reducing total possible tax cuts to 30 billion.</p>
<p>But this idea has not sat well with a group of aspiring young CDU party officials, who launched a fierce attack on Waigel last week, demanding that he scrap the planned VAT hike and resign his post as finance minister.</p>
<p>The German media have dubbed the CDU upstarts "the wild bunch" and have portrayed them as the next generation of CDU leadership after the 66-year-old Kohl retires as CDU party chairman and Germany's longest-serving post-war chancellor.</p>
<p>But Waigel rejected that notion.</p>
<p>"No, that is certainly not the CDU leadership of tomorrow. That would frighten me," he said.</p>
<p>"These yuppies who meet over pizza to plan out alternative CDU policies with enemies of the party is in my mind not a realistic generation for the future."</p>
<p>But the criticism of Waigel has had some success. The finance minister initially wanted to raise VAT two points and now the government has postponed any decision until February.</p>
<p>Criticism of the tax plan also emerged from east German CDU officials, who said Waigel was holding continued aid for the poorer east German states hostage to a VAT hike.</p>
<p>Georg Milbradt, finance minister in the state of Saxony, said linking VAT and aid for the east was "nonsense" and said similar efforts in the past had failed.</p>
<p>Waigel said he did not expect the main opposition Social Democrats (SPD) to block the tax reform or a VAT hike.</p>
<p>While the SPD is the minority in the lower house of parliament, it has a majority in the upper house, which represents the federal states. Waigel said the states would profit from the VAT hike because they get half of the revenue.</p>
<p>"The SPD will try for tactical reasons to let the reform programme fail, not everyone, but certainly party boss Oskar Lafontaine. That fits to his scorched-earth strategy."</p>
<p>But Waigel said he did not think the influential SPD state premiers would follow Lafontaine's lead at all costs.</p>
<p>"The official line is one thing. But unofficially, the state premiers come to me and say, 'Why don't you finally raise VAT at least two points?'," Waigel said.</p>
