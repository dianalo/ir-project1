<p>Hong Kong stocks ended with small gains on Wednesday, after investors spent a cautious session searching for direction and awaiting fiscal 1996 results from the Henderson group due after the close, analysts said.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index ended with a 12.74 point gain at 11,236.36. Turnover was HK$3.74 billion, down from HK$4.71 billion on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"People are still looking for direction. Not a great deal happened on the Street (overnight)," said Rory McAllister at HSBC James Capel.</p>
<p>Wall Street stocks ended slightly weaker on Tuesday with the Dow industrials slipping 6.66 points to 5,727.18.</p>
<p>Edward Chan, research director at Standard Chartered Securities, said Hong Kong stocks were likely to move sideways in the short-term following a sharp rally early in the week.</p>
<p>The Hang Seng index gained 187.01 points on Monday and rose 11.02 points on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We have already seen a strong rebound over last few days so sentiment tends to be quite cautious. I think people expect there will be a minor (U.S.) interest rate increase either at the end of the month or next month," said Chan.</p>
<p>Shares in Henderson Land finished the session down HK$0.75 at HK$61.00 ahead of the release of its fiscal 1996 results.</p>
<p>Shares in Henderson Investment, also due to release results later on Wednesday, closed unchanged at HK$8.15 and Henderson China Holdings rose HK$0.50 to HK$17.00.</p>
<p>China Light &amp; Power Co Ltd rose sharply, ending the session up HK$0.80 at HK$33.70 amid talk of a possible covered warrant issue on the stock, brokers said.</p>
<p>Swire Pacific shares were also boosted by talk of a covered warrant issue and closed HK$0.75 higher at HK$68.25.</p>
<p>Swire said the pre-sale of 48 residential units at its Island Place property development had received an "enthusiastic reponse" with 160 applications registered on Tuesday, the first day of registration.</p>
<p>Star Entertainment continued to surge ahead of a proposed rights issue. The stock gained HK$0.29 to close at HK$1.13.</p>
<p>New World Infrastructure fell HK$0.25 to HK$17.45 and Road King Infrastructure Ltd shed HK$0.20 to HK$6.20.</p>
<p>Brokers said investors were concerned about an oversupply of highway infrastructure related stocks, with at least two H-share issues in the sector expected in coming weeks.</p>
