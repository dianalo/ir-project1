<p>Iomega Corp said on Friday it plans to open a North Carolina packaging and distribution facility, creating 300 jobs when it is operational in September.</p>
<p>Iomega plans to move the packaging and distribution facilities, currently in Roy, Utah, to the new facility in Greensboro by the fourth quarter of 1997.</p>
<p>This completes the manufacturing and distribution restructuring which began in late 1996 when Iomega shifted high-volume production to its new facility in Malaysia, Iomega said in a statement.</p>
<p>A majority of the current distribution employees in Roy affected by the move are under temporary employment contracts and have already found new employment opportunities inside and outside the company.</p>
<p>In December, the company announced that it would eliminate between 500 and 700 positions at its Roy facilities in production, manufacturing and distribution areas.</p>
<p>Roy remains the worldwide headquarters for Iomega and will continue to house research and development, strategic procurement, finance, sales and marketing as well as prototype development and production.</p>
