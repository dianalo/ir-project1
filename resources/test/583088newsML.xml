<p>Austrian brick maker Wienerberger was poised to sell its abrasive materials and chemicals unit Treibacher after the group on Wednesday said it would make an "important" announcement early on Thursday, analysts said.</p>
<p>"That is a strong possibility," said Austria analyst Alfred Reisenberger of IMI Group Sigeco. "They've always said that they want to concentrate on their core business and sell this unit when the time is right."</p>
<p>The Vienna bourse suspended Wienerberger shares, which are part of the key ATX index, from trading on Thursday until 0900 GMT. The market opens officially at 0730 GMT.</p>
<p>Treibacher, with 1996 sales of 3.5 billion schillings ($292 million), accounts for about 23 percent of Wienerberger's group sales. The unit reported earnings before taxes and interest (EBIT) of 206 million schillings last year.</p>
<p>Analysts put the value of the company, which operates nine plants in Europe, the U.S. and Canada, at around 500 million schillings ($42 million).</p>
<p>Wienerberger said its announcement on Thursday would concern an "important structural development" in one of its business units but declined to give any details.</p>
<p>Another analyst speculated it was likely that Wienerberger was about to sell its real estate unit, which accounts for only three percent of group sales but reported a hefty 1996 EBIT of 264 million schillings.</p>
<p>The unit operates a chain of multi-storey car parks, prime Vienna offices and retail outlets, as well as refuse sites.</p>
<p>Wienerberger's group EBIT fell to 1.602 billion schillings in 1996 from 1.674 billion a year earlier. Group sales were at 15.06 billion schillings, up from 12.86 billion in 1995.</p>
<p>Chief executive Erhard Schaschl told a news conference last month that the group wanted to continue concentrating on its core businesses -- bricks and pipes.</p>
<p>Asked specifically whether a sale of Treibacher was on the cards, he said: "We love Treibacher, but nothing lasts forever."</p>
<p>Wienerberger made a string of acquisitions to strengthen its hold on the European brick market over the past years, including Belgium's Terca Bricks in April of last year and France's Sturm in the second half of 1995.</p>
<p>The group, which is 32.2 percent controlled by Austria's Creditanstalt, now operates 157 plants in 21 countries on three continents.</p>
<p>But analysts agreed it was unlikely that the group would make another acquisition in this area for the time being.</p>
<p>"I can't imagine that they would make another acquisition in this area of business," Reisenberger said.</p>
<p>"My bet is on Treibacher," said another.</p>
