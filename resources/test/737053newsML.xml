<p>U.S. stocks trading in London edged lower on mild profit-taking Thursday after the Dow's surge through the 8,000 mark overnight.</p>
<p>"We're looking for a slightly lower opening in New York," said one trader. "The market appears to be unstoppable but must be vulnerable to profit-taking...it really looks to have overstepped itself."</p>
<p>The Dow shattered the 8,000 mark on Wednesday after strong corporate profits and mild inflation data triggered a buying spree. The Dow ended 63 points higher at 8,039 and the Nasdaq posted its biggest single-day point rise of 38.5 to 1,581.  </p>
<p>Shares in Microsoft had traded around $1-3/4 better at $150 in London on expectations of good earnings news.</p>
<p>Kodak, which tumbled in New York after posting worse- than-expected results, bounced from lows to trade at $69 compared with a close of $68-3/8.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, shares in AT&amp;T slipped $1/4 to $36 after news that President John Walter had resigned nearly nine months after he was chosen as the heir apparent to Chief Executive Officer Robert Allen.</p>
<p>Woolworth meanwhile, added $3/8 to $25-1/2 on reports that the group was considering closing or converting more than half of its troubled stores to improve profitability.</p>
