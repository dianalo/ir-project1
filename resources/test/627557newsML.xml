<p>If opposition Socialists overpower the centre right in French elections on Sunday, Bund investors will view the two mainstays of Europe's planned single currency with great scepticism, economists said on Friday.</p>
<p>Faith in Germany as the last defender of a strict line on Maastricht criteria is crumbling amid bitter squabbling over plans to use central bank reserves to meet entry rules.</p>
<p>The prospect of a left-wing French government favouring flexible, if not lax, EMU interpretation adds another layer of doubt over the strength of the future euro.</p>
<p>"These would not be good preconditions for EMU," said Petra Koehler, economist at Dresdner Bank in Frankfurt. "The biggest burden for Bunds is the gold reserve issue, but a socialist win in France would be an additional burden."</p>
<p>Monday's market reaction will depend largely on how far, if at all, the French people vote for a move to the left.</p>
<p>Bunds, under attack from all sides over the past few weeks, sold off sharply last Monday after French socialists posted strong gains in the first round of voting. They dived again on Wednesday on rumours that latest polls predicted a victory for the left -- so the market is braced for a socialist win.</p>
<p>"If the socialists get in, the market has priced that in, so the fallout shouldn't be too bad," said a debt futures broker in London.</p>
<p>"But the absolute worst case scenario for the markets would be a socialist-communist coalition -- then French markets would really come under attack and Bunds will suffer," he said.</p>
<p>Markets are not worried that a socialist government will return to traditional policies of fiscal slackness. But economists said that Germany's mooted gold reserve revaulation plan will invite a new French government to stress that room for manoeuvre is offered in the Maaastricht treaty.</p>
<p>Indeed, socialist leader Lionel Jospin said earlier this week that Germany should stop going on about strict Maastricht rules and accept the flexibility Bonn itself is seeking to apply to its own books.</p>
<p>"Our German friends, who are so rigorous about the criteria, are looking to see if they can fudge things," he said.</p>
<p>With both France and Germany likely candidates to fail a strict meeting of Maastricht rules, and amid apparent political softening on both sides, investors are becoming increasingly convinced that the euro established in January 1999 will be weak and built on shaky foundations.</p>
<p>Against that background, Bunds will be in almost as much trouble as their French counterparts if the left-wing wins through on Sunday.</p>
<p>"The risk is that we will see France underperforming Germany if we get a socialist win on Sunday -- but not by much," said Phyllis Reed, European bond strategist at BZW in London.</p>
<p>In the cash market, the spread between 10-year German Bund yields and their French counterparts has pulled back over the last week, moving from around minus 14 basis points to minus nine currently with France lagging behind Germany on performance.</p>
<p>Bunds might not be as badly hit as French bonds in any immediate post-election sell-off on Monday. But further out, concern about a weakling euro will take its toll and Bunds, tarnished by talk of domestic 'fudging', will no longer be able to rely on its status as a safe haven for support.</p>
<p>"Investors are getting completely fed up with European bonds altogether," said BZW's Reed. "We would say that in this environment Treasuries are the best safe-haven."</p>
