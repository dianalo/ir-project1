<p>Papua New Guinea oil explorer and producer Oil Search Ltd said on Tuesday an unfavourable currency exchange rate weighed on its first half profit.</p>
<p>Oil Search said the first half to June 30 had been a particularly successful one for the company, marred by a foreign exchange loss because of volatility in the Papua New Guinea kina.</p>
<p>Pre-tax operating profit increased 10.7 percent to A$23.6 million, but higher tax and a $3.5 million foreign exchange loss dragged net profit down to A$9.06 million, the company said.  </p>
<p>In first half 1995, Oil Search recorded a currency gain of A$3.2 million.</p>
<p>Development of the Kutubu oil field operated by Chevron Corp is progressing above expectations, with production in the first half of 1996 well over 100,000 barrels of oil a day, Oil Search said.</p>
<p>Oil Search said its share of output from Kutubu totalled 1.51 million barrels in the first half, up 6.7 percent from a year earlier. Oil Search holds a 7.7 prcent interest in Kutubu.  </p>
<p>The increase reflected a successful development drilling programme that added to oil reserves and increased production capacity, Oil Search said.</p>
<p>"While the result was adversely affected by foreign exchange losses, because of volatility in the PNG kina, the company has never been better positioned financially and operationally," chairman Trevor Kennedy said in a statement.</p>
<p>The average realised oil price for the period was A$25.25 a barrel, up from A$24.61 a barrel a year earlier.  </p>
<p>Reserves at Kutubu in the half-year were extended and now are estimated at 305 million barrels, up from 293 million in the same period a year ago, Oil Search said.</p>
<p>Further development work on the field is progressing in an effort to delay a decline in production, the company said.</p>
<p>It said it was confident Chevron would be able to continue to find new reserves at the field while maintaining low operating costs in comparison with other fields in the region.</p>
<p>Low-cost drilling and development options for further work at Kutubu are being reviewed for 1997, as well, the company said.  </p>
<p>Some higher-risk drilling is also likely, following acquisition of seismic over the fields in late 1996, Oil Search said.</p>
<p>At 1.20 p.m. (0320 GMT), Oil Search shares were trading one cent lower at A$1.42.</p>
