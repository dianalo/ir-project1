<p>Manila has secured a preliminary air services agreement allowing Philippine carriers to increase their services to Hong Kong, the presidential palace said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The new agreement will allow Philippine carriers to increase their maximum capacity to 11,500 seats a week from the present 9,500.</p>
<p>This will rise to 12,500 by 1997 and 13,000 by 1998, the palace said.</p>
<p>The new deal will also allow Philippine carriers the right to fly onward to Europe from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The agreement was initialled earlier this month but will have to be vetted by the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group overseeing the British colony's transition to Chinese sovereignty next year, the statement said.</p>
