<p>Taiwan food giant President Enterprises Corp said on Wednesday it was holding talks with potential buyers to sell its franchise rights to all 31 Kentucky Fried Chicken (KFC) stores on the island.</p>
<p>A company spokeswoman confirmed local reports that a Hong Kong-based investment fund was interested in buying President's rights to operate KFC outlets in Taiwan for T$1 billion.</p>
<p>"The company is having discussions with the investment fund," the spokeswoman said by telephone, but declined to give further details.</p>
<p>KFC is a subsidiary of PepsiCo Inc.</p>
<p>In April 1995, President said it would eventually be forced to close all KFC outlets in Taiwan after failing to reach agreement on renewal terms with PepsiCo.</p>
<p>President obtained the rights to use the KFC trademark under the agreement that it paid four percent of total turnover to KFC's U.S. parent and US$5,000 on the opening of each KFC store.</p>
<p>President had said the U.S. fast food giant wanted to raise the trademark fee to five percent of total turnover in Taiwan and the fee for opening a new outlet to US$25,000. President said the hikes were unacceptable.</p>
