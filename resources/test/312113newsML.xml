<p>The dollar rose against the mark Thursday, while talk of Japanese central bank sales weakened the U.S. currency after an early rally against the yen.</p>
<p>The dollar advanced broadly in early trading, lifted by remarks from a German central banker that weakened the mark and rumours that a newsletter released by a Washington-based consulting firm said the U.S. government could tolerate the dollar climbing to 120 yen.</p>
<p>But traders, already on tenterhooks after Japan's finance minister again carped about the yen's recent slide during Tokyo trading, soon discounted the newsletter rumours.</p>
<p>The Japanese central bank declined to comment on rumours it had sold dollars early in the U.S. session. But talk of such intervention cut off the dollar's early rally just short of Wednesday's 45-month high near 117.50 yen.</p>
<p>"I cannot confirm anything. I don't know if anybody can," said John McCarthy, of ING Barings Capital Markets in New York. "Obviously there was some selling interest driving it all the way down to 116.25 (yen)."</p>
<p>The dollar ended at 116.50 yen, down from 116.82 on Wednesday and at 1.5943 marks, up from 1.5877.</p>
<p>Commenting on the dollar's rise to 117.48 yen on Wednesday, Japanese Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said Thursday it is not desirable for the foreign exchange rate to fluctuate wildly, and that the excessive yen depreciation is also undesirable.</p>
<p>Concerns that Japanese government proposals on budget belt-tightening this spring could derail an already fragile economy sent Japan's stock market into a tailspin last week. The yen has tumbled since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Foreigners have exacerbated the yen's slide by selling Japanese assets and then exchanging the revenues for other currencies.</p>
<p>"Utlimately we'll probably see Japan intervene in some protracted fashion, because there is very little reason at this stage to own yen," said David Gilmore, partner at consulting firm Foreign Exchange Analytics.</p>
<p>The mark slumped after remarks from Hans-Juergen Krupp, who sits on the Bundesbank's policy-making council.</p>
<p>Krupp told an audience in Hamburg the record rate of German joblessness proved the German economy was in a grave position and said the German central bank could not be indifferent.</p>
<p>"That would be probably be one of the reasons why the dollar popped up and I think that is one reason why the mark is under so much pressure," said McCarthy.</p>
<p>The dollar reached a 30-month high at 1.6001 marks on Wednesday, fuelled by speculation the Bundesbank might trim interest rates to stimulate Germany's weak economy.</p>
<p>Lower German rates make dollar investments in the United States, where deposit rates are already higher, even more attractive.</p>
<p>"I think the outlook is just so rosy on the U.S. economy and not so on Germany that it just seems to be a natural play people want to make," said John Beerling, chief dealer at Norwest Bank in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>In other trading, the dollar rose to 1.3765 Swiss francs from 1.3710 on Wednesday. It fell to Canadian $1.3413 from C$1.3415. The pound fell to $1.6793 from $1.6845.</p>
