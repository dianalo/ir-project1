<p>President Sali Berisha made concessions to Albania's opposition, halting a drive against insurgents as a senior European Union team was due to arrive on Friday to help map out a solution to the armed rebellion.</p>
<p>Berisha's five-hour meeting on Thursday with his own Democratic Party and nine opposition groupings produced an agreement to suspend for 48 hours operations against heavily armed rebels in the south of the country.</p>
<p>The fighters, in turn, were offered an amnesty if they handed in their weaponry beginning at 6 a.m. (0500 GMT) on condition that they had committed no crimes.</p>
<p>But there was no indication that rebels in the port of Vlore and other southern towns under their control would abide by an accord, even if signed by political opponents of a government whose replacement they have demanded.</p>
<p>Many of the insurgents vowed to maintain their rebellion until Berisha, re-elected to a second term this week by a parliament dominated by his Democrats, stepped down.</p>
<p>"This is a popular uprising and won't stop until Berisha resigns," former army officer Davar told an evening rally in the main square of the port of Sarande -- in violation of a curfew.</p>
<p>Dutch Foreign Minister Hans Van Mierlo held talks on his way to Tirana in Rome and Athens -- the two capitals most directly concerned by any flood of migrants if order broke down in Albania. He believed Berisha was giving ground.</p>
<p>"It is not a matter of if but when," Van Mierlo, whose country currently holds the EU's rotating chairmanship, told reporters in Athens.</p>
<p>Van Mierlo is the first senior Western minister to visit Albania since it imposed emergency rule on Sunday to quell the unrest in the south of the country. A day later, Berisha easily won re-election from parliament to a second five-year term.</p>
<p>Berisha last week suggested early elections within 45 days to opposition parties and pledged to step down if his rightists lost power. The opposition said that,given the climate of turmoil and suspicion, the time frame was too short.</p>
<p>International pressure has mounted on Albania to take swift action. A Council of Europe delegation was already in Tirana and former Austrian Chancellor Franz Vranitzky said he intended to come to Tirana despite logistical troubles and warned the conflict could spill over into other parts of the Balkans.</p>
<p>Berisha issued a decree enacting the amnesty after more than five hours of talks with 10 political parties. He also pledged to seek a political consensus on replacing Prime Minister Aleksander Meksi, who stepped down last weekend.</p>
<p>State television said the Defence Council, which oversees emergency regulations, had ordered a suspension of military action in southern areas.</p>
<p>At least 16 people have died in the past week, most in the Adriatic port of Vlore, focal point of the protests which first erupted last month by investors who lost savings in failed pyramid investment schemes.</p>
<p>State television showed other towns in the country of 3.4 million with shops and factories functioning normally. Italy said it would send back Albanians who crossed the Adriatic Sea to escape the violence. Twenty-nine people who arrived by boat on Wednesday would probably be returned by ferry.</p>
