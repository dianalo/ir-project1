<p>Sierra Leone's U.N. ambassador said on Monday that his country's coup leaders wanted money to give up power and called on the U.N. Security Council to warn the rebels against genocide.</p>
<p>James Jonah, representative for elected President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, ousted by junior army officers on May 25, said negotiations initiated by Britain and the United States were largely acceptable to Kabbah, now in neighbouring Guinea.</p>
<p>He said the president had sent a letter to Nigerian head of state, General Sani Abacha, with a copy to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, saying  he accepts a deal that would grant amnesty to the coup leaders, look at grievances in the army and other demands.</p>
<p>"They asked for monetary payment," he said without mentioning a sum. "And they want 18 months in office to loot further. That is all they want to do. It is just shameful."</p>
<p>Asked again if they wanted money to step down from power," Jonah replied, "Exactly."</p>
<p>Jonah said Kabbah had asked him to say publicly that his government supported all diplomatic efforts to end the coup. However, he said the demand for the restoration of his government was "non-negotiable."</p>
<p>He said the coup leaders had agreed to many terms but their allies, the guerrilla Revolutionary United Front (RUF) which took up arms in 1991, had refused.</p>
<p>Jonah, a former U.N. undersecretary-general, said he was not seeking a Security Council meeting on the coup because the West African group, ECOWAS, had full authority to take any action "if they think this is necessary."</p>
<p>But he said he had spoken to Council President Sergei Lavrov about killing and threats of killings of civilians by the junta. He said the council should warn the coup leaders that they all would be responsible before an international tribunal if they carried out their plans.</p>
<p>"The junta and the RUF are planning genocide in the event of what they consider (military) intervention. In light of the experience in Rwanda...I met with the security council president to issue a warning on this."</p>
<p>Jonah said those in open opposition to the government were in danger of being killed. Three of his brothers had been threatened with death on Sunday unless he personally "condemned any Nigerian intervention."</p>
<p>Nigerian troops have sent soldiers to topple the coup leaders, some of them already in the country under a treaty.</p>
<p>Jonah also said the junta had sent numerous cables to the United Nations, trying to recall him as ambassador, without realising this would mean recognition of their regime, which has been roundly condemned.</p>
<p>In answer to queries, he also criticised the British charity group, International Alert, which facilitated early contacts, saying their strategy fed into the hands of the coup leaders. He said they wanted to establish a fact-finding mission during which time no outside action could be taken.</p>
<p>"This could take months, so in a way they are trying to strengthen the coup d'etat," he said.</p>
<p>Asked why Nigerian soldiers did not appear to be making headway in their attempt to topple the coup leaders, he said Kabbah was concerned about civilian casualities. "You should not expect a very hasty operation."</p>
<p>He said some of the Nigerian actions were not accurately reported after they had shelled military headquarters last week. In response the junta attacked a hotel that was lightly defended and considered a safe haven housing foreigners.</p>
<p>"In the end the Red Cross intervened, asked for a ceasefire and asked the Nigerians to leave" because their presence was drawing fire. "Instead of focussing on the inhumane action of the junta and the RUF in targeting a civilian hotel, the focus was on Nigeria," he said.</p>
