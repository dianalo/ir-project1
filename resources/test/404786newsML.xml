<p>Continental Airlines said it will be marketing its own freight capacity on flights from Paris when it moves from Paris-Orly airport to Paris-CDG next month.</p>
<p>"Air Canada currently serves as our cargo sales agent in France but this agreement comes to an end at the month," said Francois Leplace, who has been appointed Continental Airlines Cargo Operations and Sales Manager France, a newly-created post, effective March 3.</p>
<p>Continental Airlines seven-strong cargo team will move into offices at CDG Terminal 2 on April 6 with the first of its flights from the airport scheduled for April 7.</p>
<p>The U.S. carrier currently operates daily flights between Paris/Orly and Houston and Paris/Orly and New York/Newark using five pallet-capacity DC10-30 passenger aircraft.</p>
<p>"The advantage of being at CDG as opposed to Orly is that the vast majority of our freight is consolidated there so the move should facilitate operations on top of having our own personnel on-site," Laplace added. - Reuters Air Cargo Newsroom Tel+44 171 542 7706 Fax+5017</p>
