<p>The company said in a statement the group has made inroads into foreign infrastructure markets with completion of a road system in Batam Industrial Park, Indonesia and a major public road construction in Cambodia.  </p>
<p>The group's turnover more than doubled to Singapore $63.3 million in 1996 from S$25.7 million in 1992, the statement said. Pre-tax profit quadrupled to about S$6.0 million from S$1.3 million over the same period.</p>
