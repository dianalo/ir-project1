<p>Croatia's central bank cut the interest paid on its liquidity bills on Wednesday, in what it said was a logical step to follow trimming of the official rates.</p>
<p>It declined to say whether it had signalled investors -- commercial banks -- to put in bids at lower rates for the paper sold weekly to mop up excess kuna from the banking system.</p>
<p>The central bank plans no other operations on the money market this week, an official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The 35-day 35- and 91-day rates were cut by 50 basis points to 7.0 and 8.50 percent, respectively at the regular auction.</p>
<p>Bill volume rose slightly to 92 million kuna on an average 470 million on the banks' balances this week. Clients can view full auction results on page  NBHT.</p>
<p>The banking sector liquidity was bolstered after the central bank broght the reserve requirement down to under 35 percent on kuna deposits, effective from April.</p>
<p>In March it cut the discount rate to 5.9 from 6.5 percent previusly and the Lombard emergency lending rate for banks to 9.5 percent from 11.</p>
<p>The central bank envisages further easing of its monetary policy this year in a bid to help the economy. -- Kolumbina Bencevic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075</p>
