<p>A hike in interest rates by the Bank of England on Monday sparked a rush of activity in the short sterling options pits, and pummelled implied volatility, traders said.</p>
<p>The British central bank raised official rates by a quarter point to 7.0 percent, the fourth consecutive rise since May. Although the move was not unexpected, doubts about the timing had arisen over the last week.</p>
<p>"Things have gone crazy down here since the rate rise," said a trader at a British brokerage on the LIFFE floor. "Short sterling has been so stuck recently, it's like a dam just burst."</p>
<p>Implied volatility of the December straddle was trading around 7.5 percent by 1230 GMT, off from around 8.0 percent in early trade. At-the-money volatility started the week around 8.75 percent in December, and has been sliding since then.</p>
<p>"Volatility is being heavily sold off in the wake of the rate hike," said a trader at a Japanese bank.</p>
<p>Traders said the feeling in the market was that the move was the last one for the time being, leaving few upside barriers to short sterling futures. December futures were up 0.13 at 92.68 by 1300 GMT, compared with 92.59 before the rate rise. Traders noted some resistance at the July 7 high of 92.70, but said that was likely to give way.</p>
<p>The December futures contract has been trading in a broadly sideways range since early July.</p>
<p>Upside call buying was enjoying the lion's share of trade, with the 92.75 strike most active, followed by 93.00. About 8,000 lots of the former strike were done and more than 2,500 of the latter. Puts traded briskly at the same strikes but with far less volume.</p>
