<p>Pakistani money market rates remained high on Sunday as the market continued to run short of funds, dealers said.</p>
<p>Overnight trades continued to be conducted at 17 percent, one dealer of KASB &amp; Co said.</p>
<p>One-week rates showed no change as borrowers were willing to cover positions at rates as high as 17 percent but trading remained very thin, he said. The repo window of the State (central) Bank of Pakistan had to be tapped for funds, he said.</p>
