<p>Sri Lanka stocks closed marginally down on Monday on retail profit-taking among blue chips, but turnover was high on foreign buying, brokers said.</p>
<p>The all share index closed 2.00 points down at 771.8 with decliners outnumbering gainers 34 to 27. Blue chips Commercial Bank fell five rupees to 215, Hayleys three to 247, John Keells Holdings seven to 273, Lanka Orix Leasing 9.50 to 225.50.</p>
<p>"Retailers took profit among a number of highly capitalised blue chips which pushed down the index," said a broker who declined to be identified. "But there was enough buying to cushion the downside."  </p>
<p>Turnover was 102.9 million rupees, led by foreign buying of 100,000 Development Finance Corporation.</p>
<p>There was a net inflow of foreign funds, as buying was worth 58.7 million rupees and selling 33.1 million.</p>
<p>The stock exchange lifted the trading halt on Kotagala Plantations on Monday. Trading in the firm's shares was suspended on Friday, pending clarification of the fate of a subsidiary which bought another plantation firm last year.</p>
<p>Brokers say the all share should be ranged this the week, though volumes may be high, as retail profit-taking restrains the index, following the steep rise of the previous week.</p>
