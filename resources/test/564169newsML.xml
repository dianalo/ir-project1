<p>Ireland's Minister for Commerce, Science and Technology Pat Rabbitte on Tuesday expressed satisfaction that the long-running dispute at Irish Life Plc had been referred to the Employer Labour Conference.</p>
<p>Rabbitte noted in a statement that the parties to the dispute had accepted the involvement of the Employer Labour Conference as a binding arbitration process.</p>
<p>A meeting of staff in the chief office branch of the Manufacturing, Science and Finance Union (MSF) union in April called on both sides to allow the Employer Labour Conference to become involved in the dispute so that a binding settlement might be agreed upon.</p>
<p>Irish Life suspended most of its field force in February after failing to solve a 15-month old dispute over new work practices. Further attempts to resolve the dispute had also failed.</p>
