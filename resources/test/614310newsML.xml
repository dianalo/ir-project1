<p>The Dutch Finance Ministry will try to raise between 5.0 billion and 7.5 billion guilders when it reopens tap sales of its 5.75 percent bond due February 2007 on Tuesday, two banks said on Monday.</p>
<p>Rabobank International said in its Financial Weekly publication that it expected the issue would raise 5.0-7.5 billion guilders, increasing the amount on issue in the 10-year benchmark state loan to between 12.5 billion and 15.0 billion.</p>
<p>It said first prices in the grey market indicated it would be issued at a spread of almost eight basis points below the German 6.0 percent January 4, 2007 Bund.</p>
<p>Rabobank noted that the yield spread to Germany had narrowed from 10 basis points in the last two weeks due to issuance of long guilder Eurobonds and the expectation that the 5.75 percent February 2007 bond would be reopened.</p>
<p>"We think that the current spread is appropriate. Dutch institutions are looking for long bonds but at prevailing prices, the tap is not really cheap," it said.</p>
<p>It said the 10-year benchmark was likely to become "rich" when compared with other 2006-2007 bonds.</p>
<p>ABN AMRO Hoare Govett said in its Bond Weekly report that it expected 5.0 billion guilders would be raised in the tap sale.</p>
<p>It said the 5.75 percent February 2007 bond had never traded very rich since it was first issued in January, but it would probably cheapen in coming days because of the reopening.</p>
<p>The tap sales begin at 0700 GMT each day until further notice.</p>
<p>The existing tranche of 5.75 percent February 2007 bonds, first issued in January, were trading at a bid yield of 5.82 percent at 1550 GMT, a discount of seven basis points to the January 2007 bunds.</p>
