<p>British motorway restaurants to rental television company Granada Group said on Thursday it was selling textile service firm Spring Grove Services to Davis Service Group for 136.5 million pounds ($213.9 million).</p>
<p>The sale is conditional on Davis shareholder and regulatory approval. Davis said it was setting a one-for-three rights issue at 215 pence to raise 71.5 million pounds to help pay for the deal.</p>
<p>Granada said the disposal was part of its strategy to focus on core businesses.</p>
<p>Since the company won its hostile bid battle for hotels group Forte in January, its disposals, spanning bowling centre interests to the White Hart Hotels portfolio, have generated over 350 million pounds of cash proceeds to cut debt, Granada said.</p>
<p>Davis, which earlier reported a 10 percent rise in half year pretax profits and dividend to 12.3 million pounds and 3.39 pence respectively, said the acquisition of Spring Grove would start benefiting earnings in 1997 with the full positive impact flowing through in 1998.</p>
<p>Spring Grove, which mainly provides rental and cleaning services for workwear as well as washroom towels and mats to business customers in Britain, Ireland and Germany, made a pretax profit of 11.6 million pounds in 1995 and has assets of about 53 million pounds.</p>
<p>Davis, whose activities focus on textile maintenance services, site maintenance services and support services, is holding an extraordinary meeting on September 23 for shareholders to vote on the acquistion and the rights issue.</p>
<p>"The directors consider that the opportunity to strengthen the product and services range, to improve operating margins and to derive benefits from enhanced systems across the enlarged customer base, combined with the scope for operating synergies, create significant potential for earnings growth," said Neil Benson, Davis chairman.
