<p>The government raised its real economic growth estimate for 1996 to around 10 percent from its previous estimate of seven percent or more.</p>
<p>"According to the central payments bureau, total income of the real sector for the sale of goods, services and other income rose 14.4 percent between January and October 1996," Deputy Prime Minister Borislav Skegro told a news conference.</p>
<p>Deflated, these figures produce a real GDP increase of well over 10 percent.</p>
<p>"And that excludes the so-called "non-real' sector (public services and state institutions)," Skegro said.</p>
<p>He estimated the average rise in budget revenues at central government and local levels, plus revenues of institutions such as health and pension funds and the employment bureau, at 15.6 percent.</p>
<p>Electric power production, another factor closely linked to economic growth, rose 25.5 percent, he said. -- Kolumbina Bencevic, Zagreb Newsroom, 385-1-4557075</p>
