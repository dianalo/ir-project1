<p>Albanian gunmen sprayed a public bus with bullets on Wednesday, killing one passenger and wounding seven others just south of the capital Tirana, an interior ministry source said.</p>
<p>In one of the worst incidents in the wave of violence which has swept the Balkan country, the gunmen overtook the bus in a four-wheel drive vehicle and then opened fire. A child was in critical condition in hospital, the source said.  </p>
<p>Albania has been engulfed by turmoil since January, when a series of fraudulent investment schemes collapsed, igniting furious protests by ruined depositors. Most of the south has since been taken over by rebels in an armed insurrection.</p>
<p>But the kind of lawlessness by armed gangs which has reigned in the south has been rare in the capital itself, where police and the army are still in control.</p>
<p>The incident took place near the village of Sauk, just south of Tirana and about one hour before an evening curfew which was imposed with a state of emergency early this month. The gunmen fled and the motive for the shooting was unknown.</p>
