<p>Spot electricity prices in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) eased Tuesday with little demand due to mild temperatures, brokers and markters said.</p>
<p>"I'm having one heck of a time getting rid of our power," said one frustrated seller.</p>
<p>Temperatures through much of Texas were in the mid-80 degree Fahrenheit area, and were expected to remain at normal or below normal levels through to October 10.</p>
<p>On-peak firm ERCOT power for Wednesday delivery was talked steady in the $18.50-19.50 range, the brokers and marketers said.</p>
<p>Off-peak firm next-day power was said to be offered as low as $11.00 per MWh with no takers.</p>
<p>"Everybody seems to be an off peak seller, there's just no demand for it," said one marketer.</p>
<p>Off-peak ERCOT power was assessed at $13.25-14.00 on Monday.</p>
