<p>Daimler-Benz InterServices AG (Debis), the services arm of Germany's Daimler-Benz group, on Thursday dismissed market speculation it plans to raise its stake in French software maker Cap Gemini.</p>
<p>"We have no interest at this time of raising our stake of 24.4 percent in Cap Gemini," Debis spokesman Rainer Knubben told Reuters.</p>
<p>He added that this would not be allowed because it would violate the bank holding company law of the United States.</p>
<p>Traders have speculated that Daimler could carry out a capital increase without the participation of Deutsche Bank and thereby get around the U.S. law.</p>
<p>But when asked about this, Knubben just repeated his statement that Debis had no current plans to raise its stake in Cap Gemini.</p>
