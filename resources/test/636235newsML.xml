<headline>CWB grain shipment complaint hearing to be Aug 11.</headline>

<p>A hearing to determine whether Canada's two major railway firms were to blame for a backlog of vessels at Pacific ports earlier this year was set on Wednesday to begin in Saskatoon, Sask., on August 11.</p>
<p>"The Canadian Wheat Board is allowed to submit its complaint and the railways will be cross examined," Canadian Transportation Agency spokesman, Charles Mojsej said.</p>
<p>The CTA is a federal, quasi-judicial tribunal that rules on transportation disputes. The CWB faces more than C$15 million in demurrage fines after ships waited up to 62 days to load grain at Pacific ports between January and March.</p>
<p>In a complaint filed to the CTA in April, the Wheat Board said the railways gave grain movement a low priority.</p>
<p>Canadian National Railway Co and Canadian Pacific unit CP Rail System has asked the CTA to dismiss the CWB's complaint but were their motion was denied.</p>
<p>The railway firms blamed shipment delays on heavy snowfall, extreme cold and equipment failure.</p>
<p>Importers such as Japan expressed concern over the delays.</p>
<p>Two weeks of hearing were scheduled to begin August 11 at Saskatoon's Sheraton Cavalier Hotel, the CTA's Mojsej said.</p>
<p>Forty-one other parties applied to testify, he added.</p>
