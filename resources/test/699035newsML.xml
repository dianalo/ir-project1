<p>The National Labour Relations Board (NLRB) said on Tuesday it would seek an injunction requiring Detroit's two daily newspapers to offer to reinstate striking workers and fire replacement workers if necessary.</p>
<p>NLRB Chairman William Gould said in a statement that the board voted unanimously on Tuesday in favour of the action.</p>
<p>The NLRB's regional director in Detroit will file the petition in the U.S. District Court there later this week or early next week, the statement said.</p>
<p>The NLRB move follows a June 19 decision by an administrative law judge that the employers had unlawfully refused to bargain with the unions. The strike, which started July 13, 1995, was an unfair-practice strike at its start that was prolonged by subsequent unlawful threats to replace strikers, the judge decided.</p>
<p>The NLRB's injunction would seek to reinstate only those strikers who have unconditionally offered to return to work and who have not been discharged for strike misconduct, the statement said.</p>
<p>"Collective bargaining -- through which our nation seeks to translate the democratic principles so well accepted in our political process into workplace relations -- is at the heart of our legal system," Gould said.</p>
<p>Gould's agency administers the National Labour Relations Act.</p>
<p>The Detroit News is owned by Gannett Co. Inc. and the Detroit Free Press by Knight-Ridder Inc. The papers are editorially separate but are published by a joint operating company.</p>
