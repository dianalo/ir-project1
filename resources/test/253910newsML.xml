<p>Shenzhen-based China Bicycle Holdings Co Ltd said on Thursday it had obtained a US$25 million loan from an overseas banking group headed by the Singapore Development Bank.</p>
<p>An agreement on the three-year loan, carrying annual interest of SIBOR plus 1.65 percentage points, was signed on December 4, with repayment to begin in stages one year later, China Bicycle said in a statement in the China Securities newspaper.</p>
<p>China Bicycle plans to use the loan to expand output and sale of bicycles, a company spokesman told the Hong Kong-based newsletter China Securities Bulletin.</p>
<p>He said the Shenzhen-listed firm turned out and sold less than one million bicycles so far this year, with 75 percent exported and the remaining sold within China. Half of the exports went to the U.S. and the rest to Europe, he added.</p>
<p>The company sold about 600,000 bicycles in the first half of this year, against 1.30 million in all 1995 and 1.60 million in all 1994, the official said.  </p>
<p>He blamed this year's low sales on U.S. anti-dumping charges. Washington had accused China Bicycle of dumping its products in the U.S. market, but, following a year-long investigation, U.S. trade officials said in June this year they had decided not to impose sanctions on Chinese bike makers.</p>
<p>"Overseas purchasing orders dropped in 1996, which forced China Bicycle to reduce its output," the spokesman said.</p>
<p>He said the company aimed to make and sell 1.2 million bikes in 1997 thanks to months of efforts to re-build business relationships with foreign customers it lost during the legal dispute.</p>
<p>He declined to estimate China Bicycle's profits this year or give a forecast for 1997, but said the firm's exports would fully recover next year.</p>
<p>He said the bike maker was negotiating with a German firm on joint construction of a high-tech fertiliser project in Shenzhen in 1997. If successful, the project should become one of China Bicycle's main profit sources in the future, he added but gave no more details.  </p>
<p>China Bicycle said in an interim report that it had net earnings of 8.58 million yuan in the January-June period of 1996, down from 72.53 million yuan in the year-ago period.</p>
<p>It did not state whether the results were compiled under Chinese or international accounting standards.</p>
