<p>U.S. service center shipments of aluminum mill products in August fell from July's level, and shipments in the year through August were 3.2 percent below last year's comparable period, National Association of Aluminum Distributors said.</p>
<p>According to NAAD's three-month moving average index, shipments in August fell to 133.9 points from 135.1 points in July. Inventory fell to 122.5 points from 124.2 in July, but inventory rose slightly to 2.8 months in August from 2.7 in July.</p>
<p>A service center in western U.S. said third-quarter shipments were down 13 percent due to weaker offtake by the technology sector. Truck transportation demand was still sluggish but the aircraft/airframe market was improving markedly.</p>
<p>A Midwest service center said volumes shipped were still good but prices continued to decline slowly. "We think that will be the scenario through the end of the year with 1997 showing a leveling in the price deterioration," the service center official told NAAD.</p>
