<p>The Bulgarian Agricultural Chamber (BAC) urged the government to raise wheat purchasing prices and buy grain from local producers rather than import grain from abroad at higher international rates.</p>
<p>"The government should not seek credits to import wheat, but use dollar credits to buy wheat from local farmers," BAC chairman Todor Pandov told a news conference on Thursday.</p>
<p>Bulgaria, currently battling an acute grain shortage due to excessive exports last year, faces a poor harvest this year and intends to import large quantities of wheat.</p>
<p>If the socialist government gives incentives to local grain producers, it is likely to buy more wheat from them to cover the annual domestic consumption of 1.6 million tonnes.</p>
<p>Bulgaria has so far secured 473,000 tonnes of wheat from local producers, down from the planned 1.2 million tonnes, the agriculture ministry said.</p>
<p>Many local producers refrain from selling their wheat to state mills hoping for higher prices from private grain exporters.</p>
<p>State wheat purchasing prices range to maximum $134 per tonne. This compares to lowest international prices of around $200 per tonne, said Pandov.</p>
<p>Bulgaria had said it hopes to negotiate an import deal for 150,000 tonnes of wheat with the European Union. The country also expects to import around 100,000 tonnes of grain worth $25 million under the U.S. Export Credit Guarantee Programme.</p>
<p>The government plannes to apply for funds to meet grain import payments from an International Monetary Fund facility extended to countries with short-term balance of payments problems. -- Jana Katsarova, Sofia Newsroom, 359-2-84561</p>
