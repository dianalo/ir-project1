<p>A cold front sweeping into the U.S. from Canada this week again sent NYMEX natgas shorts scurrying for the sidelines Wednesday, driving the front of the complex to another series of new futures contract highs.</p>
<p>The unexpected cold, forecast to cover much of the nation for most of the rest of the month, caught many by surprise and helped fuel a spectacular 37 percent rally in the NYMEX spot-December contract over the last five sessions.</p>
<p>"There's a short squeeze going on. Some people must have been caught big time and there's a lot of panic," said a Texas trader.  </p>
<p>A New York trader agreed, adding, "The locals smell blood. They must be burying a lot of people."</p>
<p>December futures, which expire Thursday, surged Wednesday by 32.1 cents, or 10 percent, to close at $3.627 per million British thermal units after earlier setting a new contract high of $3.65. The December close was the highest ever for a spot month and the highest intraday level since Dec 21, 1995, when spot futures soared to the all-time high of $3.72.</p>
<p>January futures also set a new benchmark of $3.34 today before closing up 9.4 cents at $3.264.</p>
<p>But some said the recent move may be too much, too soon, particularly with winter still on the horizon.  </p>
<p>"The weather forecast was a big surprise, but I would think a 60-cent rally was sufficient for any kind of weather surprise," said one Houston-based trader, adding he expected a profit taking pullback after December goes off the board.</p>
<p>But traders said any pullback was likely to be short-lived, citing ongoing concerns about low storage in some areas and the uncertainty about winter weather.</p>
<p>"People are being very conservative about storage. They're trying to hold off on withdrawals. They'd rather pay up a little now than get caught later," said a Texas trader, referring to the price spikes seen last winter when stocks were drained to record low levels by a steady stream of cold from Canada.  </p>
<p>American Gas Association said Wednesday U.S. gas stocks fell last week by 86 bcf, at the high end of expectations. Overall inventories are still 181 bcf, or six percent, below year-ago, but storage in the critical Consuming Region East was at 92 percent full and still slightly above last year.</p>
<p>U.S. Gulf Coast spot natural gas prices followed the paper market higher this week, with swing climbing to the $3.40 area today, up almost 70 cents since November 1.</p>
<p>But some feared lofty gas prices this month and next would chase end-users back to cheaper residual fuel and shift the supply/demand balance in favor of the bears.</p>
<p>"At these prices, you're going to lose industrial and utility load to resid," a Midwest trader said.</p>
<p>December gas at the New York city gate was pegged near $5.00/mmBtu versus December New York Harbor one percent resid at a $3.50/mmBtu equivalent.</p>
