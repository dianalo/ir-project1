<p>The condition of Indiana's winter wheat crop slipped a bit during the week ended April 20, according to the weekly crop report from Indiana's Agricultural Statistics Service.</p>
<p>The winter wheat crop was rated 57 percent good to excellent, down from last week's good to excellent rating of 66 percent.</p>
<p>The wheat crop was 27 percent jointed, versus last week's pace of 13 percent and the five-year average of 22 percent, the report said.</p>
<p>Indiana farmers also began to plant corn at a more active rate, the report said. Corn planting progress was five percent in the latest week, versus the previous week's rating of one percent and the five-year average of three percent, the report said.</p>
<p>"Corn planting is picking up speed around the state," the report said. "The best progress was made in the northwest quadrant of the state."</p>
<p>Tillage operations also made good progress as farmers continued to apply fertilizer. Much of the acreage is awaiting warmer soil temperatures for seeding, the report said.</p>
<p>For the week ending Friday, 3.5 days were suitable for fieldwork. Topsil moisture was rated 73 percent adequate.</p>
