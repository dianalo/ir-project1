<headline>Baby Bells rally on Bell Atlantic merge OK.</headline>

<p>U.S. local telephone stocks rallied Friday after U.S. antitrust regulators approved Bell Atlantic Corp's merger with NYNEX Corp, which analysts said gives an unexpected green-light to industry mega-mergers.</p>
<p>Bell Atlantic led the pack, racing ahead 5-3/4 to 64-1/2, following the news of the U.S. Justice Department's go-ahead for the merger and a ratings ungrade by Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>"There is a fervor in the stocks today," Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Klugman said of the uncharacteristic flurry of activity in the group, adding that "They are not moving like Bell stocks traditionally do."  </p>
<p>"Some of that is perhaps a spillover from the Department of Justice news," Prudential analyst Guy Woodlief said. "There may be some speculation in the marketplace regarding potential further mergers and combinations," he said.</p>
<p>In addition, Woodlief said he believed some of the gains reflected the "very strong" earnings report released by U S West Communications Group earlier Friday, the final member of of the group to report first quarter earnings.</p>
<p>"Now we have seen all of the local exchange carriers report very healthy earnings for the first quarter," he said.  </p>
<p>By mid-afternoon, NYNEX had swelled 4-1/2 to 48-7/8, Ameritech Corp rose 2-3/8 points to 59 and BellSouth Corp added 1-1/2 to 42-3/4.</p>
<p>Local service provider GTE Corp, often grouped with the Baby Bells, gained 1-3/4 to 45-1/8.  SBC Communications Inc rose 1-3/8 to 51-7/8 following its recent merger with Pacific Telesis Group.</p>
<p>U S West shares were at 33, up 1-5/8.  Net income of $0.68 per share had beat the $0.65 consensus and the year-ago first quarter's $0.61.  </p>
<p>Woodlief, who reiterated his buy rating on Bell Atlantic Friday in a report entitled "Top 10 Reasons to Buy Bell Atlantic Now," said the stock was due for a bounce as it had been trading at a large discount to other Bells recently.</p>
<p>He said Bell Atlantic stock was 16 percent below that of its peers in terms of its price earnings multiple at Thursday's close.</p>
<p>"Some of that discount represented uncertainty about what the Department of Justice would do regarding the merger," he said in an interview. "Now that uncertainty has been removed."</p>
<p>Woodlief said he believed the gap in price/earnings multiples separating Bell Atlantic from and the Baby Bell group, including GTE, will now close.</p>
<p>While agreeing that merger speculation was behind the Baby Bell share price gains Friday, Goldman's Klugman remained doubtful whether actual deals would result.</p>
<p>"I think you will see continuous speculation, but that doesn't necessarily mean deals, Klugman said.</p>
