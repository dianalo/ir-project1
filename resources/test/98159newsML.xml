<p>Thousands of Israelis took to the streets of Jerusalem on Saturday in support of the Middle East peace process ahead of the resumption of negotiations with the PLO, interupted by a wave of violence in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>
<p>The demonstrators called on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to resign for his handling of peace talks and mourned the murder of prime minister Yitzhak Rabin 11 months ago by a religious Jew bent on halting peace moves.</p>
<p>In Gaza, Palestinian President Yasser Arafat returned home, three days after an emergency Washington summit with Netanyahu which Palestinians described as a failure.</p>
<p>Asked about the chance for progress in the talks with Israel on Sunday, which PLO officials said would begin at 6 p.m. (1600 GMT), Arafat said: "We have to wait and see.</p>
<p>"We are not asking for the moon and we gave a new chance for peace," he told reporters outside his Gaza office as hundreds of supporters cheered his return.</p>
<p>Arafat arrived from Egypt after stops in Morocco, Tunisia, France and Italy. He was scheduled to brief members of his Palestinian Authority on results of the summit U.S. President Bill Clinton convened to save Middle East peace talks.</p>
<p>Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa warned that in Cairo the region would be thrown into a crisis if Israel does not change its hardline stance in talks with the Palestinians.</p>
<p>"Pessimism is the prevailing feeling in the area. The Washington talks, the decision to resume negotiations, the presence of the American side...all that behoves the Israelis to move and change their negative posture," Moussa told reporters after Arafat met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.</p>
<p>"If not then it will be indeed be a very, very serious situation," he said.</p>
<p>The U.S.-sponsored peace process faced its biggest threat yet as violence erupted in the West Bank and Gaza last week when Israel opened a second entrance to an archaeological tunnel near a Moslem shrine. Clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police and civilians killed 73 people.</p>
<p>Israeli hardliners hailed Netanyahu for refusing to give Arafat concessions at the summit on the tunnel issue or set a date for Israel's promised redeployment of troops in Hebron.</p>
<p>The fate of Hebron, the last large West Bank town under Israeli occupation and the only Arab city with a Jewish settler population, was expected to head the agenda at Sunday's meeting.</p>
<p>The talks will be conducted at the Erez crossing between Israel and Gaza by members of an Israeli-Palestinian steering committe and mediated by U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross. PLO officials said Arafat and Netanyahu would not take part.</p>
<p>U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christoper was expected to arrive in the region early on Sunday and meet separately with Netanyahu and Arafat.</p>
<p>The peace demonstration in Jerusalem marked a year since a right-wing protest at the same site where portraits of Rabin in a Nazi uniform were distributed. That protest was a key link in the chain that led to Rabin's murder on November 4, sponsors of Saturday's demonstration said.</p>
<p>"We did not come here to hate...we came here to remember and to remind people," Rabin's son, Yuval, addressed the crowd. He warned that the gun of assassin Yigal Amir "could shoot again".</p>
<p>Other demonstrators called on Netanyahu to withdraw Israeli troops from Hebron.</p>
