<p>NYMEX heating oil settled higher than anyone had expected Thursday, but with gasoil prices on the IPE spiking even more, few doubt that the rally is far from over, traders said Thursday.</p>
<p>"It's the more of the same on the heating oil," said Jim Ritterbusch, a trader with Sweeney Oil Co in Chicago. "Thus far the prices have not risen enough to attract more supplies to market," he said, referring to low domestic stocks.</p>
<p>November heat, taking out contract and post-Gulf War highs all day long, settled 2.71 cents higher at 74.69 cents a gallon -- just shy of the intraday high of 74.80 cents.  </p>
<p>November crude succumbed to heating oil's pull by the end of the day after spending most of the session at or just below resistance at $24.65 a barrel, settling a sharp 76 cents higher at $24.81 a barrel.</p>
<p>"Water keeps building up against the old dam and it breaks," Ritterbusch said, referring to how heating oil's stellar performance in the end cracked crude's resistance.</p>
<p>The November heat-to-crude crack spread blew out Thursday to $6.56 a barrel, up from Wednesday's settlement of $6.18.</p>
<p>November gasoline was tugged along too, ending 1.26 cents up at 63.68 cents a gallon, with resistance at 64.00 cents.  </p>
<p>The rally began with the first cool weather sweeping into the huge Northeastern heating oil market at a time when inventories in the region are the lowest they have been in a generation.</p>
<p>"Basically, the sky's the limit," said Tom Bentz, energy analyst at ING Derivatives in New York. "It's low stocks, cold weather, and it's technical strength," Bentz said.</p>
