<p>China's infrastructure sector will open its domestic market to foreign investment further in the next 15 years, the China News Service said on Thursday.</p>
<p>China plans to raise at least $30 billion from abroad for road construction in the next five years, it said, quoting a report by Wang Luolin and Jiang Xiaojuan of the think-tank, the China Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).</p>
<p>The telecommunications sector needed $6.0 billion in foreign investment in the same period, the report said.</p>
<p>The State Planning Commission was also seeking investment for some key projects, including the Three Gorges Dam project and construction of highways between Beijing and Shanghai, it said.</p>
<p>Direct foreign investment in China is expected to rise an average 10.2 percent a year from 1996 to 2000, to total $230-270 billion in the five-year period, state media said.</p>
<p>State statisticians had calculated that if annual economic growth was around 8.0 percent, China would need $50 billion in direct foreign investment each year. If annual growth rose to 9.0 percent, $90 billion would be required.</p>
