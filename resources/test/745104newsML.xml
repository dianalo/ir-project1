<p>Italian defender Alessandro Pistone has joined English premier league Newcastle from Internazionale for 13 billion lire ($7.6 million), the Milan club said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Newcastle signed Pistone on a four-year contract worth $1.0 million a year with a clause which stipulates that if he returns to Italy he must play for Inter.</p>
<p>"The offer from Newcastle was sizeable, Pistone will be earning more than double what he's making here," Inter president Massimo Moratti said.</p>
<p>"His choice was inevitable and he'll pick up experience in England but I hope to see him in the blue and black shirt of Inter in the future."</p>
<p>Pistone, who turns 22 on Sunday, joined Inter in November 1995 after three seasons playing in the lower reaches of the Italian league.</p>
