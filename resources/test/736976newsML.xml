<p>Cargo airline Air Foyle said it is evaluating using the commercial freighter version of the McDonnell Douglas Corp C-17 military transport which is being planned by the St Louis-based planemaker.</p>
<p>(Corrects to make clear that Air Foyle is evaluating the aircraft for itself, not for McDonnell).</p>
<p>McDonnell announced on May 13 plans to produce a commercial model of the military transport C-17, to be called the MD-17, to carry large cargo shipments.</p>
<p>"We have been approached by McDonnell Douglas about the new aircraft, which it is seeking to promote, develop and sell," Chris Foyle, chairman of the UK independent cargo specialist airline, told Reuters in an interview.</p>
<p>"The difficulty involved in converting the C-17 to civilian operation is how to make it work economically and financially," he said.</p>
<p>He added that the aircraft could carry 60-70 tonnes of cargo and would cost $170 million per plane.</p>
<p>"The payload is less than the (100-tonne capacity) Boeing 747-400 freighter and yet it would cost more," he said.</p>
<p>But he added that the MD-17's advantages include the fact that it is a cargo aircraft ideal for carrying outsize shipments, unlike the 747F.</p>
<p>"Its role is similar to, although it is smaller than, the (Ukraine-built, 140-tonne capacity) AN-124," said Foyle.</p>
<p>Air Foyle has a management agreement with Ukraine-based Antonov Design Bureau, under which it operates up to six AN-124s on worlwide charters.</p>
<p>"Other advantages of the MD-17 are that it can use short, 1,200-metre-long runways, meaning it can gain access to airports that cannot be served by the AN-124, and it needs only a small crew,"he said.</p>
<p>"So there are some plus points and some negative ones. We are still looking at the proposal," Foyle added.</p>
<p>Airline industry sources said that it is unlikely Air Foyle would be able to afford an MD-17 aircraft.</p>
<p>Therefore, some form of leasing agreement with McDonnell Douglas would be its preferred option if the airline pursued an interest in flying the new aircraft, the sources add.</p>
<p>Foyle said that McDonnell Douglas had talked to other carriers apart from Air Foyle about their using MD-17 cargo planes.</p>
<p>McDonnell agreed in December last year to merge with Boeing Co in a $14 billion dean. However the merger is expected to be blocked by the European Commission, if it follows a recommendation of a European anti-trust panel, concerned at Boeing's dominant position in the world's civil aviation market. - Reuters Air Cargo Service Tel+ 44 171 542 7706 Fax +5017 - www.racs.com</p>
