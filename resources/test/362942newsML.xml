<p>Slovak shares firmed slightly in livelier trading on the the Bratislava Stock Exchange (BSE) on Friday, as gains to several blue chip shares countered a 3.61 percent fall in the average price of oil refiner Slovnaft.</p>
<p>Slovnaft lost 30 crowns to close at 800, but on trade of only 30 shares. Brokers said investors were testing the waters off the automated market at higher levels.</p>
<p>"There were some direct trades (in Slovnaft) at 850 crowns, and we think current demand for Slovnaft shares could push it to between 830 and 850 crown levels," said Dusan Sykora of ING Barings.</p>
<p>Steel producer VSZ climbed 10 crowns to this year's high of 670 crowns, but brokers said it was hard to predict future trends on the stock.</p>
<p>"Though there is still demand for VSZ share... its price often moves in cycles and you can never be sure whether or not this is the peak," Sykora said.</p>
<p>But he said that the bullish sentiment was expected to remain on the market in the short-term, boosted mainly by interest among foreign players.</p>
<p>Oil and gas storage company Nafta closed unchanged at 1,700 crowns. The largest commercial bank VUB rose 16 to close at 1,720 crowns.</p>
<p>Overall volume rose to 528,114 shares, boosted mostly by direct trades, up from 154,397 stocks traded on Thursday. Turnover increased to 480.69 million crowns from 60.75 million. -- Peter Laca, Bratislava Newsroom, 42-7-521-8402</p>
