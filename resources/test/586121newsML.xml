<p>Cuba said on Thursday it will use "the necessary means" to ensure there are no violations of Cuban territory by a protest flotilla of boats and planes planned for this weekend by Miami-based Cuban exiles.</p>
<p>Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Marianela Ferriol described the exile plans as a "new attempt at a provocation."</p>
<p>Speaking at a regular weekly news briefing, Ferriol reiterated the government's stance that it will use "the means necessary to ensure there are no violations of Cuba's airspace or territorial waters."</p>
<p>She did not elaborate, although Cuba has made similar statements ahead of previous exile-organised flotillas.</p>
<p>In February 1996 Cuban MiG fighters shot down two small exile-crewed planes near the island, killing the four Cuban-American crew and sparking outrage in the United States and elsewhere.</p>
<p>President Fidel Castro's government defended its action by saying the planes were violating its territory. Washington said the downed planes were outside Cuban airspace, and wherever they were, should not have been shot down.</p>
<p>This weekend's flotilla was planned by an exile group called Democracy Movement, which said on Wednesday that about 35 boats and 14 planes will travel to the edge of Cuban territory to promote a national work stoppage on the communist-ruled island.</p>
<p>The flotilla will be part of a series of waterborne and airborne demonstrations planned this year in advance of Pope John Paul's scheduled visit to Cuba in January 1998, the group said.</p>
<p>In Washington, the U.S. State Department cautioned the exiles against entering Cuban territory, territorial sea or airspace without authorisation from the Cuban government, saying they would place themselves and others "in serious danger."</p>
<p>The Saturday flotilla will be the latest in a series of demonstrations that have taken exiled Cubans near the island in the past three years.</p>
