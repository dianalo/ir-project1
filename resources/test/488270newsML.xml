<p>The bipartisan Congressional oil and gas caucus is drafting legislation that would provide federal tax breaks on production from marginal oil and natural gas wells, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Despite recent record-setting lease sales and equipment shortages caused by producers racing to explore for oil and gas in traditional U.S. fields, Hutchison said tax incentives were needed to ease the country's reliance on foreign oil.</p>
<p>"I think it is one thing that will pay great dividends in the end," Hutchison, a Texas Republican and caucus co-chair, said after meeting with industry executives here.</p>
<p>The tax breaks would be modeled after a program in Texas that has boosted drilling of marginal and difficult-to develop wells in the state. Those incentives led to 6,000 new wells and increased industry employment in Texas, she said.</p>
<p>The caucus also is mulling options to lower the industry's costs of complying with federal environmental regulations and head off a simmering dispute over the industry's alleged underpayment of royalties on oil and gas production, she said.</p>
<p>"The Superfund clean up just doesn't make sense at all. The only people profiting from the clean up are the lawyers," she said of the multi-billion dollar clean-up program.</p>
