<p>U.S. Treasuries closed sharply lower on Wednesday as foreign investors dumped long positions, spreading jitters that a recent heavy inflow of international capital may be over, analysts said.</p>
<p>The 6-1/2-percent 30-year benchmark Treasury bond ended at the day's lows at 98-10/32, down 1-26/32. Its yield jumped to 6.63 percent, the highest since November 6 close.</p>
<p>The selloff, which started overnight in Tokyo, gained momentum in New York trading as hedge and pension funds decided to liquidate part of their Treasury portfolios.  </p>
<p>Analysts said several domestic big players, which had been perceived to be mostly long following the recent heavy influx of foreign money, got scared after the initial selling and decided to rush to the door as well.</p>
<p>"We have talked all along about foreign central bank buying being one of the reasons underpining the (market recent) rally," said Kevin Flanagan, first vice-president and money market economist at Dean Witter Reynolds.</p>
<p>"If you lose that, there is not the wherewithal on the domestic side to pick up the burden ... The market is vulnerable," Flanagan added.  </p>
<p>Foreign investors, mainly Asian governments and corporations, are said to be holding heavy volumes of U.S. currency and dollar-denominated assets, such as Treasuries and some selective corporate bonds.</p>
<p>Paul Kasriel, chief domestic economist at Northern Trust, said China is perceived to have built up a huge war chest of foreign exchange possibly for the purpose of defending its own currency, the yuan.</p>
<p>Also, he added, the Chinese could be buying dollars and dollar-denominated assets to defend the Hong Kong dollar when China takes over the key east of the colony in July.  </p>
<p>"It's estimated that they have about $100 billion in foreign exchange now. Not all dollars, but $100 billion worth," Kasriel said.</p>
<p>So will the Chinese government continue to buy dollar-denominated assets? "I don't know, but I'd suspect probably not," Kasriel said.</p>
<p>The jitters about capital flows in the market practically overshadowed the release of a fairly friendly producer price index on Wednesday. The PPI rose on averall 0.4 percent in November. However, the core rate, which excludes food and energy price fluctuations, rose a tame 0.1 percent last month.  </p>
<p>"The PPI wasn't bad at all ... but most of the market ignored it," said a trader at a U.S. investment bank. "Everyone was looking at flows and technical levels today."</p>
<p>In technical terms, the market broke some support levels and may now dig deeper into negative territory, analysts said.</p>
<p>The 30-year bond yield, whose support in terms of yields was seen at 6.60 percent, closed at 6.63 percent. "We're now looking for 6.80 percent as the next target for the bond yield," the trader added.</p>
<p>Volume was extremely heavy at around $111.0 billion as measured by GovPX.  </p>
<p>The year bill rate was up five points at 5.20 percent.</p>
<p>The two-year note closed down 6/32 at 99-21/32, yielding 5.81 percent. The five-year note traded off 20/32 at 98-28/32 to yield 6.14 percent. The ten-year note closed down 1-6/32 at 100-26/32, yielding 6.39 percent.</p>
<p>The volume was around 38 percent above the average turnover for an autumn Wednesday. GovPX publishes real time Treasury prices and volume from five of the six intra-dealer brokers, representing 65 percent of the intra-dealers trades.</p>
<p>Analysts said the long end of the curve was mostly hurt by the selloff. The damage on the short-end of the spectrum was contained as players sought a safe-haven in short-term securities and cash-like investments.</p>
<p>The three-month Treasury bill rate up two basis points at 4.84 percent. The six-month bill rate rose four points to 5.03 percent.  </p>
