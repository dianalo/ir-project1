<p>Australia's competition regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), had advised the current proposal for Global Wool was likely to result in a lessening of competition, Wesfarmers Dalgety Ltd, a partner in the proposed venture, said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Global Wool is a proposed wool marketing and handling joint venture between Wool International, Elders Ltd and Wesfarmers Dalgety. Proposed start-up date was July 1.</p>
<p>Partners evaluating Global Wool had received an outline of the ACCC's position on the project, Wesfarmers said.  </p>
<p>The partners had arranged to meet the ACCC to seek further details of its advice that, as presently structured, the proposal was likely to result in a lessening of competition, Wesfarmers said.</p>
<p>The three organisations had reaffirmed their conviction that the Australian wool industry was in dire need of reform in the handling and marketing of its product if it was to remain competitive in the long-term in the international textile market, it said.  </p>
<p>Further announcements would be made when the meeting with ACCC had taken place and Global Wool had had an opportunity to consider its position, it said.</p>
