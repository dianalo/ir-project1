<p>Tamil Tiger guerrillas said on Thursday they had killed or wounded some 800 Sri Lankan soldiers in the first two weeks of 1997, giving the government what it said was an inauspicious start to the year.</p>
<p>"The Sri Lankan military has lost 799 men during the first two weeks of this year. The military has suffered 357 deaths and has had 442 wounded," the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam's (LTTE) official Voice of Tigers said in a radio broadcast.</p>
<p>"It has been a very inauspicious beginning for the military this year," the radio said.</p>
<p>A Defence Ministry official said the rebels' figures were exaggerated, but admitted the number of casualties have been high for both sides this year.</p>
<p>"They too have had a bad year so far. Their casualties are higher than ours," the official, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters.</p>
<p>Rebel radio said a bulk of the casualties were from last Thursday's attack on Paranthan, a key road junction town just south of the Jaffna peninsula, 320 km (200 miles) north of Colombo.</p>
<p>The Defence Ministry has said that 223 soldiers were killed and 232 wounded in the attack.</p>
<p>It said at least 350 LTTE guerrillas were also killed and more than 700 were wounded in the attack.</p>
<p>The radio added that the LTTE, fighting for an independent homeland for minority Tamils in this predominantly Sinhalese island's north and east, have inflicted casualties in several other attacks on military targets this year.</p>
<p>At least eight soldiers were killed and ten wounded when an army tractor was blown up by a rebel landmine at Kachchai in the Jaffna peninsula on Sunday.</p>
<p>The government says more than 50,000 people have died in the war, now in its 14th year. The LTTE says the toll is higher.</p>
