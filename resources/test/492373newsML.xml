<p>The official Wallis report into Australia's financial system may not be released until Tuesday or Wednesday at the earliest, government sources said on Monday.</p>
<p>Cabinet begins a two-day session on Monday afternoon and is expected to consider the report and the government's response, the sources said.</p>
<p>The report was not expected to be released until after the cabinet meeting, they said.  </p>
<p>Treasurer Peter Costello said late last month that the report, which is expected to recommend the easing of rules currently preventing any merger of Australia's largest banks, would be released in the week starting April 7.</p>
<p>Costello is currently returning from a meeting of Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group Finance Ministers in the Philippines.</p>
