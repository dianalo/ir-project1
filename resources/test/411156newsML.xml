<p>Summit Bancorp and Collective Bancorp Inc said Friday they have a definitive agreement to merge in a stock-for-stock exchange.</p>
<p>Collective shareholders will receive 0.895 share of Summit for each share of Collective in a tax-free swap, according to a joint statement by the banks.  </p>
<p>Summit will receive an option to purchase up to 19.9 percent of Collective's common stock if certain conditions occur, they said.</p>
<p>Based on the closing price of Summit common stock last night, the transaction has a value of $42.51 per Collective share, or a total of about $867 million, the companies said.</p>
<p>Collective has the right to terminate the deal if Summit's average stock price during the determination period falls below $39 and is 18 percent below an index of 20 banking companies.  </p>
<p>The terms of the merger have been approved by the boards of both companies, the banks said.</p>
<p>The merger is expected to be completed by the third quarter, subject to regulatory and Collective Bancorp shareholder approval, they said.</p>
<p>Summit said it will account for the acquisition as a pooling-of-interests, and expects to incur a one-time after-tax restructuring charge of about $33 million.</p>
<p>Collective said it had 20.4 million common shares outstanding on December 31, 1996.  </p>
<p>Both advisers have provided fairness opinions in connection with the transaction, according to the companies.</p>
<p>"Collective offers us the opportunity to expand the market penetration of our key businesses into additional important areas of the state (New Jersey). We expect this acquisition to be accretive to earnings in 1998," Summit Chairman and Chief Executive Officer T. Joseph Semrod said in the announcement.</p>
<p>Summit is based in Princeton, N.J., and has $23 billion in assets and $18 billion in deposits. It operates over 350 branches throughout New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Collective is a thrift holding company based in Egg Harbor City, N.J., with $5.5 billion in assets. Through its subsidiary, Collective Bank, it operates 82 branches in the state.</p>
