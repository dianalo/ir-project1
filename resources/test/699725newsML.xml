<p>LIFFE cocoa futures rallied to a one-year peak early in the session on Tuesday but ended the morning trade firmer but off day's highs.</p>
<p>Benchmark September advanced to 1,169 stg a tonne, the highest since June 1996, after gapping 15 stg higher at the open and breaching the previous support at 1,162.</p>
<p>But it lacked further upward momentum and the contract ended the morning business 12 down at 1,162 after a seven stg range.</p>
<p>"I think a lot of people are waiting to buy if the market goes down," said one trader.</p>
<p>Traders said business was less brisk and it centred on light July/Sept switches and AA trades.</p>
<p>Overall volume totalled just 4,131 lots, compared with Monday's full-day volume of 14,112 lots.</p>
<p>Monday's session was dominated by massive against actual trade, the bulk of it posted against the July contract ahead the first tender day on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A total of 4,301 10-tonne lots were tendered on Tuesday. But traders said the quantity was within expectation based on the large number of grading and the sizeable amount available for tenders.</p>
<p>The open interest on July shrank sharply to 7,500 lots by the close of business on Monday from 15,000 on Friday, LIFFE said.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, traders were keeping an eye on second quarter European cocoa grind data, due later this week or early next week. Analysts said the figures were expected to show a mixed trend. -- Jalil Hamid, London newsroom +44 171 542 4985</p>
