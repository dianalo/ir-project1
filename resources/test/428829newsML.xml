<p>Indian Foreign Minister Inder Kumar Gujral said on Saturday that talks with Pakistan this month will address all issues of mutual concern and the freezing of trade between the two neighbours had been "mere waste".</p>
<p>"The Indo-Pakistan dialogue, which will resume later this month, is expected to address all issues of mutual concern," Gujral said in a speech prepared for delivery to a business conference in New Delhi.  </p>
<p>Pakistan announced on Thursday that foreign ministry secretaries of the two governments would meet in New Delhi on March 28-31, and Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda said he hoped to see a positive outcome.</p>
<p>"I think that there is a growing perception on both sides of the India-Pakistan border that the freezing of our bilateral trade and economic relationship over the past decades has achieved nothing better than mere waste and futility," Gujral said.</p>
<p>The last round of talks between the South Asian neighbours in January 1994 bogged down in differences over Kashmir, which is divided between India, which controls two thirds of the Himalayan region, and Pakistan, with the rest.</p>
<p>India and Pakistan have fought three wars, two of them over Kashmir, since they gained independence from Britain in 1947.</p>
