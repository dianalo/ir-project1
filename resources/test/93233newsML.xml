<title>UK: IPE gas oil curve seen still steep into year-end.</title>
<headline>IPE gas oil curve seen still steep into year-end.</headline>
<dateline>LONDON 1996-10-03</dateline>

<p>The steep backwardation across the price curve in IPE gas oil futures will continue to support the market early in the fourth quarter after outright prices hit 5-1/2 year highs on Thursday, analysts and traders said.</p>
<p>But their views were divided for deeper into winter after a rally of nearly $45 or 23 percent in the last month alone.</p>
<p>How much the arrival of heating oil cargoes from North America can dent the backwardation in prices was also uncertain.</p>
<p>"Every time we don't build stocks in the U.S., we won't build in Europe," said Bo Van Wijk, vice president in energy risk management at UBS in Zurich. "The problem is if the U.S. is going to export product they're not going to build stocks."</p>
<p>"By exporting the oil they will import the potential problem," he said.</p>
<p>This comes on top of a strategy by oil companies that one analyst referred to as KILL -- keep inventories lean and low -- that raises demand for immediate supplies but widens the backwardation and discourages inventory building.</p>
<p>The October 1 deadline for changing the sulphur content of diesel to 0.05 pct has also contributed to tightness in the higher sulphur gas oil, analysts said.</p>
<p>"If we go into winter with a similar stock situation we could easily see $30-$40 backwardation a month," in the Jan/Feb, Feb/Mar and Mar/Apr spreads, said Van Wijk.</p>
<p>With the October expiring next Thursday, the Oct/Nov backwardation was trading near $13.00 late Thursday.</p>
<p>The nearby-to-second-month spread ballooned to roughly $23.50 in March and then narrowed to minus $3 in May.</p>
<p>Oct gas oil was $3.25 higher at $246.50 a tonne after rising to $247, the highest since prices hit $352 in February 1991.</p>
<p>Charles Gray, analyst at Prudential Bache, said a next target was $248.25, roughly a 50 percent retracement of the Gulf war high at $363 to a post-Gulf War low in 1994 near $133.75.</p>
<p>Consumer stocks in Germany, which accounts for about one-third of European demand, were about 62 percent of capacity at the end of August, eight percent below normal, Van Wijk said.</p>
<p>He also said that stocks rarely build more than one percentage point from end-August to end-October, so the prospects are bleak for inventories to catch up there.</p>
<p>"Inevitably, the avalanche of material that is coming into Europe has to take the edge off people's needs and once that happens we're not going to see the same intensity," said Mari Buglass, senior European oil analyst at Smith Barney in London.</p>
<p>"After we get through the first half of October it will be difficult for gas oil to sustain the ferocity of the upward move," she added, while acknowledging that prices were still vulnerable to further gains ahead of October's expiry.</p>
<p>Total middle distillate stocks in Europe at the end of August were 286.3 million barrels, down from 312.1 million a year ago, according to Euroilstock data.</p>
<p>Paul Horsnell, assistant director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said prices were more vulnerable to a price spike due to the low stock cover and steep backwardation.</p>
<p>"(But) I think it's far too early in early October to start seriously predicting what's going to happen in the late fourth quarter or first quarter," he said.</p>
<p>"It's not clear what the Asian market is going to look like and we have to sort out the spec change."</p>
