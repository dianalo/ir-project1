<p>A Sumitomo Corp shareholder has submitted a warning to the firm stating his intention to sue the company for compensation for the trade house's massive copper trading losses, one of the shareholder's lawyers said on Monday.  </p>
<p>"We have decided to file a suit," said Tadashi Matsumaru, a lawyer for Sumitomo shareholder Kazuyoshi Yuoka.</p>
<p>He added, however, that it had not been decided whether the suit would request compensation for the full $2.6 billion in estimated copper trading losses or whether all the company's directors, or just those considered responsible for the losses, would be targeted.</p>
<p>The notice submitted to Sumitomo on Monday, required by Japanese law, requests that the auditor file suit against the directors within 30 days. If no action is taken during that time, the shareholder may then file suit.  </p>
<p>Under Japanese law, representative shareholder suits such as Yuoka's require the directors to compensate the company as a whole rather than just the shareholder who files suit.</p>
<p>Yuoka, who owns 2,000 of Sumitomo's more than one billion shares, also filed a suit against the company in late September to repeal the approval of a fund to cover the massive copper losses that was given at Sumitomo's shareholders' meeting in June.</p>
<p>A Sumitomo spokesman declined to comment on Yuoka's latest move, stating that the company was still studying the notification.  </p>
<p>Sumitomo officials have repeatedly said the massive copper trading losses, first announced in June, were due to unauthorised trades by the company's former chief copper trader Yasuo Hamanaka.</p>
<p>They have also insisted that none of Hamanaka's superiors knew of the deals.</p>
<p>Hamanaka was recently arrested for fraud and forgery in connection with the unauthorised trading. One of his lawyers has said Hamanaka has admitted the forgery charges but that he has not commented directly on whether any of his bosses knew of his activities.  </p>
<p>The statement Yuoka submitted to Sumitomo on Monday charged that the directors did not fulfil their responsibility to supervise copper transactions and ensure there were no improprieties.</p>
<p>The statement said, for example, that if Sumitomo's directors had carried out investigations and supervision in response to inquiries from the London Metal Exchange in 1991, when a U.S. trader accused Hamanaka of asking for verification of phoney trades, they should have been able to discover Hamanaka's allegedly improper actions.</p>
<p>The statement added that if the auditor did not sue the directors for compensation of the copper trading losses within 30 days, a shareholder suit would be filed. -- Edmund Klamann, Tokyo Commodity Desk +81-3-3432-6179</p>
