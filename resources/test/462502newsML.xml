<headline>MALEV STARTS TRUCKING CARGO TO UKRAINE.</headline>
<text>
<p>BUDAPEST, March 24 (Budapest) - Hungarian national airline Malev Rt [MALV.CN] said on Monday it recently started weekly cargo shipments by truck to Lviv, an industrial city in western Ukraine.</p>
<p>The truck, which has capacity to carry 20 tonnes or 80 cubic meters, leaves Budapest on Tuesdays, arrives in Lviv on Thursdays and returns to Budapest on Saturdays, Ferenc Harmath, Malev's commercial manager for cargo operations, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"We started the service because we had some requests from Germany and the United States to export a variety of goods to Lviv," Harmath said. "We've carried electronics, textiles and toys."</p>
<p>The volumes have been small, and the trucks have been returning empty from Lviv, but Malev expects the route to improve over time, he said.</p>
<p>"When our road service to Skopje started in 1995, the loads were only in the hundreds of kilograms," Harmath said. "Now we're transporting five-to-six tonnes on the route every week."</p>
<p>Malev started road-haulage services in 1994 as substitutes or supplements for short-range flights in Europe, mainly in the former East bloc.</p>
<p>The airline has trucked cargo to Bratislava, Frankfurt, Kiev, Ljubljana, Tirana, Vienna, Zagreb and Moldova's capital Chisinau, he said.</p>
<p>Malev plans no other new truck routes this year, he said.</p>
<p>The airline is owned 63.9 percent by Hungarian state privatisation agency APV Rt, 30.0 percent by Italian national airline Alitalia , 5.0 percent by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Trade's investment agency SIMEST and 1.1 percent by other interests, including Hungarian municipalities.</p>
