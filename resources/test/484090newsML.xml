<p>Bosnian authorities are struggling to overcome technical and political problems at Sarajevo airport which are preventing commercial flights from landing in poor weather, airport officials said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Although the battle-scarred airport reopened to commercial air travel last year, many civilian flights are cancelled, delayed or forced to land elsewhere because of fog and low cloud in the Sarajevo valley.</p>
<p>The French government has donated a $2 million Instrument Landing System (ILS) which guides planes to land in poor weather. But the equipment, installed only in March, has yet to be activated.</p>
<p>The ILS equipment cannot be used until the airport obtains a stable power supply, ensures security for antennae and prevents interference with its radio frequencies, officials said.</p>
<p>"I am not a financial expert, but somebody should know how much money is being lost because flights are delayed or cancelled or when an airline has to seek another airport's services," Sead Kebo, technical manager at the airport, told Reuters.</p>
<p>"The (ILS) system needs to be supplied with quality electricity and the frequencies need to be sorted out, so that a local radio station does not interfere with the landing system," said Kebo.</p>
<p>Problems surrounding commercial flights do not stop there.</p>
<p>Because the airport lies between former front lines which now in peacetime still separate Bosnia's Moslem-Croat federation and Serb republic, airport officials fear the ILS's antennae, just a few metres from Serb territory, could be easily disrupted.</p>
<p>"If a truck passed down the road close to the equipment a plane could be misguided," said an airport official, who asked not to be named.</p>
<p>"How do you get Serbs to respect the red traffic light asking them to stop when a plane is approaching the runway, I don't know. It's way too risky," he said.</p>
<p>Since the airport was reopened to civilian flights last summer, landing pilots must rely on their own eyes. The airport's previous landing system was destroyed during the 1992-95 war.</p>
<p>Controlled by United Nations peacekeepers during the war, the airport was caught between rival armies who exchanged machinegun and artillery fire across it, damaging the runway and terminal buildings.</p>
<p>The NATO-led peace force currently uses one part of the airport and its pilots use military precision radar to guide planes down, something for which civilian pilots are not trained.</p>
<p>Bosnian authorities have repaired a devastated civilian terminal building which offers bare necessities rather than glitzy duty-free shops.</p>
<p>The ILS was installed and tested three weeks ago when electricity and frequency problems were spotted during a test flight, Kebo said.</p>
<p>Airport director Bakir Karahasanovic refused to comment on possible financial losses. But the director of Bosnia's Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said the airport's problems were being addressed.</p>
<p>"The electricity problem is about to be solved and the telecommunication ministry is working on the frequency issue," Ismet Secic said.</p>
<p>He could not predict when it might be possible to use the ILS for which the CAA must give its approval.</p>
<p>In the meantime, passengers travelling by plane to and from Sarajevo in wintertime will remain hostages to the whims of Mother Nature.</p>
