<p>Gulf Arab and European ministers opened talks on Monday on forging a free trade agreement aimed at eliminating barriers to investment and technology transfer between their regions, officials said.</p>
<p>"The meeting began on an optimistic note and we hope to narrow the gap in due course to conclude the accord," a Qatari official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The talks were held behind closed doors.</p>
<p>Talks between the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and the European Union on a free trade accord have been blocked for more than 10 years by EU demands that GCC states should first unify their tariffs, which range from four percent in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to 20 percent in Bahrain.</p>
<p>The two blocs agreed in April on a time frame of no more than two years to complete the crucial accord which could open European markets for cheap petrochemicals from GCC states which sit on 40 percent of the world's oil reserves.</p>
<p>A final accord between the GCC states -- Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain and the UAE -- on tariffs has been postoponed several times.</p>
<p>The Qatari official said the GCC states had agreed on a unified tariff for nearly 85 percent of more than 1,000 commodities on the classified list and hope to forge a common customs union by 1999.</p>
<p>Raffaele Langella, general director of economic affairs at the Italian government's EU external department, was quoted by Qatari English-language paper "The Peninsula" as saying that reaching an accord between the GCC and the EU was "only a matter of time, but I hope the time is not too long".</p>
<p>Other topics to be discussed by GCC and EU ministers include growing opportunities of investment in both regions and incentives they offer each other.</p>
<p>GCC states have expressed concern at the low rate of investment by EU states in the Gulf compared to that in other regions.</p>
<p>GCC states imported EU goods worth $36 billion in 1995 and exported goods worth $25 billion, mainly oil, to EU countries.</p>
