<p>Istanbul shares dropped in subdued trade on Wednesday ahead of a 6-1/2-day holiday beginning from mid-Thurday, brokers said.</p>
<p>The IMKB National-100 closed down 12 points, or 0.78 percent at 1,523. Trade volume retreated to 14.07 trillion lira ($106.2 million) from Tuesday's 17.52 trillion ($132.2 million).</p>
<p>"Volume was very low and trade margins were narrow due to approaching holiday. Only a few stocks were active. I expect this trend to continue tomorrow," said Fatih Aslanoba from Alfa securities.</p>
<p>The market will close after the first session on Thursday and reopen on April 24, Thursday due to a 4-1/2-day religious holiday to be followed by a national holiday on April 23.</p>
<p>"I expect some selling next Thursday and Friday ahead of the National Security Council (MGK) meeting," Aslanoba said.</p>
<p>The market is unnerved by the MGK meeting scheduled for April 26 following a rift which emerged between the coalition's Islamist and conservative wings after the secularist military demanded measures against rising Islamist zeal in the February 28 MGK meeting.</p>
