<text>
<p>NetVantage Inc said Wednesday it has signed a preliminary agreement to allow Lucent Technologies Inc to license its new Ethernet switching technology.</p>
<p>The agreement calls for Lucent to make and market switching products under its own name in addition to supplying chipsets for incorporation in NetVantage's Ethernet products.</p>
<p>A NetVantage spokesman said the so-called Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)-based system reduces the size of a product designed to eliminate Intranet and local area network (LAN) traffic flow problems to the size of a single chip rather than a plug-in board.</p>
<p>Financial terms were not disclosed, although a definitive agreement is expected to be signed within 45 days.</p>
<p>NetVantage designs Ethernet workgroup switching systems.</p>
<p>Its shares were up 1/2 Wednesday at 7-1/2.</p>
