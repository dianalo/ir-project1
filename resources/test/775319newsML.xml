<p>Bulgaria's Agriculture Ministry has downgraded its 1997 tobacco output forecast to 65,000-70,000 tonnes, from its previous level of 80,000 tonnes, a ministry official said on Monday.</p>
<p>The official, who declined to be named, told Reuters that the 80,000 tonne target announced by the government in mid-July would not be met because of bad weather.</p>
<p>"This figure will not be reached due to unfavourable weather conditions and between 65,000 and 70,000 tonnes of tobacco will be produced this year," the official said.</p>
<p>The official said the ministry had information that in some areas tobacco had been hit by hailstorms in June but added that if the weather was favourable from now on and summer lasted long the output might reach 70,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>The expected output is still much higher than figure of 39,790 tonnes achieved in 1996 and the record low of 25,000 tonnes in 1995, when bad weather, low purchase prices forced growers to switch to other activities.</p>
<p>Representatives of Bulgaria's Union of Tobacco Growers last week forecast tobacco output for this year at 60,000 tonnes.</p>
<p>Last month agriculture minister Vendceslav Varbanov set new tobacco purchase prices which are 25 percent higher on average in mark terms than last year's prices, but lower in lev terms.</p>
<p>The new prices of Virginia tobacco vary between 1.07-2.78 marks per kilogramme depending on quality, compared to 0.78- 2.25 marks for tobacco from the 1996 crop. Prices of Barley tobacco will range between 1.08-1.99 marks per kilogramme, up from previous 0.78-1.62 marks.</p>
<p>Private tobacco growers, who also qualify for payments from the state tobacco fund, said the purchase prices were not attractive enough to stimulate production.</p>
<p>Under the current scheme, purchase prices of tobacco are updated twice annually in line with inflation -- in mid-July and mid-October.</p>
<p>The local lev currency was pegged at 1,000 to the mark from July 1 under an IMF-prescribed fixed exchange rate mechanism. Seven years ago, when tobacco output was between 100,000 and 150,000 tonnes annually, Bulgaria exported some 40,000 tonnes of tobacco to the former Soviet Union and only some 10,000 tonnes to Western buyers.</p>
<p>Since the collapse of Eastern bloc trade links, exports have started going mainly to French, German and U.S. companies.</p>
