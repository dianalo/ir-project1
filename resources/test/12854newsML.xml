<p>Mother Teresa, battling for her life in hospital with a weak heart, began her life-long mission in the teeming slums of Calcutta and later became an inspiration to the world with her devotion to the poor.</p>
<p>A doctor attending the 85-year-old nun said he was spending half his day taking telephone calls from around the world and nuns said well-wishes were pouring in, including messages from Pope John Paul II and Indian Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda.</p>
<p>Known as the Saint of the Gutters, Mother Teresa won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979 for bringing hope and dignity to millions of unwanted people.</p>
<p>"The poor must know that we love them," was her simple message.</p>
<p>Bowed and wrinkled, her head shrouded by a sari, she became a familiar symbol of selfless commitment to the destitute and a living saint to her multitude of followers.</p>
<p>But while the world heaped honours on her, the nun of Albanian descent has maintained she is merely doing God's work.</p>
<p>"It gives me great joy and fulfilment to love and care for the poor and neglected," she said. "The poor do not need our sympathy and pity. They need our love and compassion."</p>
<p>The diminutive Roman Catholic missionary, who turns 86 on Tuesday, was in serious condition in intensive care in a Calcutta hospital on Saturday with an unstable heart.</p>
<p>Though her high temperature was falling and her malaria was under control, a doctor said she remained on a respirator.</p>
<p>But he said she was battling for her life. "She is showing enormous strength given her age, which has surprised all of us," Dr S.K. Sen of Woodlands Nursing Home said.</p>
<p>The task Mother Teresa began alone in 1949 in Calcutta, India's most densely populated city, grew to touch the hearts of people of religions around the world.</p>
<p>When in 1979 she was told she had won the Nobel Peace Prize, she said characteristically: "I am unworthy."</p>
<p>The world disagreed, showering more than 80 national and international honours on her including the Bharat Ratna, or Jewel of India, the country's highest civilian award.</p>
<p>Her health began to deteriorate in 1989 when she was fitted with a pacemaker. A year later, the Vatican announced she was stepping down as Superior of her Missionaries of Charity order.</p>
<p>More than 100 delegates flew in from around the world to elect a successor. They could not agree, so asked her to stay on. She agreed.</p>
<p>In 1991, Mother Teresa was treated at a California hospital for heart disease and bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<p>In 1993, she fell in Rome and broke three ribs. In August the same year, she developed malaria, complicated by her heart and lung problems. Last April she fractured her left collar bone.</p>
<p>But her increasing frailty, arthritis and failing eyesight did not stop her travels around the world.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa was born Agnes Goinxha Bejaxhiu to Albanian parents in Skopje, in what was then Serbia, on August 27, 1910.</p>
<p>At the age of 18 she became a Loretto nun, hoping to work at the Order's Calcutta mission. She was sent to Loretto Abbey in Dublin and from there to India to begin her novitiate and teach geography at a convent school in Calcutta.</p>
<p>She said her divine call to work among the poor came in September, 1946. After intensive training as a nurse with American missionaries she opened her first Calcutta slum school in December 1949.</p>
<p>She took the name of Teresa, after France's Saint Therese of the Child Jesus. In India she was simply called Mother.</p>
<p>Mother Teresa set up her first home for the dying in a Hindu rest house in Calcutta after she saw a penniless woman turned away by a city hospital. Named "Nirmal Hriday" (Tender Heart), it was the first of a chain of 150 homes for dying, destitute people, admitting nearly 18,000 a year.</p>
<p>Her Missionaries of Charity, a Roman Catholic religious order she founded in 1949, now runs about 300 homes for unwanted children and the destitute in India and abroad.</p>
<p>In 1994 a British television documentary called the myth around Mother Teresa a mixture of "hyperbole and credulity" and Catholics around the world rose to her defence.</p>
