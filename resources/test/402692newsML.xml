<p>A meeting of senior financial officials from six Asia-Pacific economies next month will not function like the Group of Seven, but will be more of a forum for deep discussions, former vice finance minister Makoto Utsumi said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I don't think it will function like the G7 to discuss specific issues and so on, but is a kind of forum for more dense dialogue," Utsumi told a news conference.  </p>
<p>Utsumi added it was important that China and the United States be included in the discussions.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka said earlier that Japan would host the meeting, which would also include the United States, China, Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore, on March 4.</p>
<p>Mitsuzuka said the major topics that would be discussed would be macro-economic issues and financial market stability, including currencies.</p>
<p>He added that he hoped the meeting would be held on a regular basis, and that in the future it would include finance ministers and central bankers.</p>
