<headline>Swedish debt/currency market closing report.</headline>

<p>Swedish bond yields closed lower on Tuesday ahead of the expected decision of the ruling Social Democratic party which ruled out membership in the European economic and monetary union (EMU) in 1999.</p>
<p>The crown rose against the mark.</p>
<p>Debt yields drew their strength from stronger markets abroad in rather quiet trade while the Swedish crown firmed ahead of the statement made by Prime Minister Goran Persson.</p>
<p>"The weaker the euro is, the easier it will be to stand outside EMU. Then, markets will look more at fundamentals and Sweden looks strong now," one dealer said.  </p>
<p>The Swedish currency had gained ground to 4.4855 by 1500 GMT against an overall weaker mark compared to late on Monday when the crown was at 4.5120.</p>
<p>Six-month T-bill rates dipped two basis points to 4.23 percent. Ten-year bond yields fell six basis points to 6.95 percent.</p>
