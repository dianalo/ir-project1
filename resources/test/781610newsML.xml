<p>About 80 percent of Venezuela's working population had joined a 12-hour national work stoppage which started at 0600 EDT/1000 GMT Wednesday, a top union official said.</p>
<p>"Reports from 16 regions suggest that the strike is massive," Federico Ramirez Leon, president of the Venezuelan Workers Confederation (CTV) told the Televen television network.  The CTV called the strike to demand wage rises from private sector companies and protest a recent hike in gasoline prices.  Government offices and public institutions were shut by the stoppage and public transport had ground to a halt.  </p>
<p>Domestic and international flights were operating normally and telephone and electric services were not affected.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear if the strike had hurt oil operations or whether banks and markets would open.</p>
<p>State oil company Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA) said Monday that installations would be run by white collar staff.</p>
<p>Interior Minister Jose Guillermo Andueza congratulated unions for organizing what had so far been a peaceful strike.</p>
<p>"Union leaders are showing a great capacity to fight within the currents of Venezuelan democracy," he told the Globovision network.  </p>
<p>It was Venezuela's first national strike in eight years.</p>
<p>In the capital Caracas streets were relatively quiet. Greater than normal numbers of police patrolled the streets and National Guardsmen were stationed at certain key installations.</p>
<p>Caracas Mayor Antonio Ledezma said the walkout had brought public transport in the capital to a standstill.</p>
<p>"The strike has been a total success in Caracas since the early hours of the morning," Ledezma told the Venevision network.</p>
<p>The work stoppage has won broad support from across the political spectrum, including the government itself which has called the action "justified."</p>
<p>"This is an alarm bell for the business sector," Planning Minister Teodoro Petkoff told the Venevision network.</p>
