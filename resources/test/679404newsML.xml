<p>The Mediterranean Games proved a literally pointless experience for Albanian tennis player Imed Sejati.</p>
<p>The Albanian, whose age was given at between 15 and 18, made a brief and spectacularly unsuccessful debut at the Games in Bari, Italian newspapers reported on Monday.</p>
<p>After watching his unknown Moroccan opponent fire four straight aces past him in the first game, Sejati replied with four successive double faults. Then he retired, smiling.</p>
