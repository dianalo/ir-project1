<p>Venezuela sold 8.32 billion bolivars ($17 million) of oil bonds backed by state-owned oil company PdVSA to small investors in the first two days of the offering, PdVSA subsidiary Sofip said.</p>
<p>Nearly 13,000 Venezuelans participated in the scheme, that has been designed to spread popular participation in the country's oil industry, including President Rafael Caldera who symbolically purchased a bond Thursday.</p>
<p>Small investors will be able to purchase the paper, that yields 12.75 percent, until next Friday. Thereafter mutual funds, and then international investors, will be able to participate.</p>
<p>The ceiling on the issue is 30 billion bolivars.</p>
