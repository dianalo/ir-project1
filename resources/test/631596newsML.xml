<title>ISRAEL: Israeli bonds close higher led by unlinked bonds.</title>
<headline>Israeli bonds close higher led by unlinked bonds.</headline>

<p>Israeli bonds closed broadly higher on Monday with strong demand continuing for unlinked bonds in expectation of lower inflation, traders said.</p>
<p>Indices:</p>
<p>* Government bonds general: +0.04 pct to 106.58</p>
<p>* CPI-linked government bonds: unchanged at 106.51</p>
<p>* Unlinked government bonds: +0.08 pct to 107.33</p>
<p>* Dollar-linked government bonds: +0.13 pct to 105.43</p>
<p>* Bank of Israel short-term Makam bills: +0.05 pct to 105.94</p>
<p>Volume including Makams was a high 221 million shekels, with most of the trading in unlinked bonds, traders said.</p>
<p>"Unlinked bonds continue to show strength, with strong demand especially for Makams," said Ilan Doron of Solid Financial Markets. "This is because inflation in the coming months is expected to be low and yields on these bonds are an attractive 13.8 percent. I expect demand to continue for these bonds."</p>
<p>Demand for dollar-linked bonds was up, which Doron attributed to the sharp rise of the U.S. currency against the shekel on Monday and to reports that the government would be introducing the foreign currency liberalisation measures soon.</p>
<p>The Maariv daily said on Monday that the cabinet would meet this week to discuss measures that might include a widening of the shekel's trading band and an easing of foreign currency controls. Finance Minister Dan Meridor denied the report.</p>
<p>"Some traders fear the reform will raise the dollar and are already taking a position," he said.</p>
<p>The shekel representative rate was fixed sharply lower against the dollar on Monday following the rise of the U.S. currency against the mark on overseas markets, dealers said. The representative rate for the dollar was fixed at 3.4060 shekels, against 3.3940 on Friday.</p>
<p>Trading in CPI-linked bonds was mixed with a positive trend. "Yields (at 4.2 percent) here are less attractive, but because supply is sparse there is a tendency to buy these bonds," Doron said. "Yields will continue to fall but more slowly because of the sparse supply."</p>
<p>Three months of budget surpluses and increased privatisation revenues have enabled the government to raise less debt, tightening the supply of CPI-linked bonds, traders said. On Sunday the Treasury said that during May it had raised 113 million shekels in the domestic bond market.</p>
<p>"The central bank today issued 150 million shekels in CPI-linked bonds for 15 years, which it hadn't issued in a long time, and 75 million shekels worth of CPI-linked bonds for six years," said Tamy Diamantstein, investment adviser at Israel Discount Bank.</p>
<p>Yields for the 15-year linked bond closed at 4.32 percent and for the six-year bonds closed at 4.35 percent, a trader said.</p>
<p>Note: Makams are zero-coupon unlinked certificates with durations of three months to one year. The Bank of Israel issues Makams to absorb liquidity.</p>
