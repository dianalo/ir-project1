<p>Millfeed sales to catfish farms in the Southeast were fairly active but were slow elsehwere in the U.S., dealers said.</p>
<p>Feedmixers appeared to be reviewing prices and supply needs for the week, dealers said.</p>
<p>In many locations millfeeds had stiff competition from green pastures, hominy, and gluten feed.</p>
<p>"The business slowed down because it warmed up and the grass started growing," a Texas dealer said.</p>
<p>In the Carolinas, supplies of hominy, a popular feed for dairy cows, were ample as dairies turned cows onto pastures.  </p>
<p>Buffalo sources said prices were steady to weak there despite reduced flour mill run times, as dealers want to keep millfeed competitive with other feed ingredients.</p>
<p>"We want to keep millfeeds in the rations," a dealer said.</p>
