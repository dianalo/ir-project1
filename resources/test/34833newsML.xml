<headline>Malaysia launches second bond rating agency.</headline>

<p>Malaysia on Thursday launched its second bond rating institution as part of government efforts to create a more active debt securities market, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said.</p>
<p>The Malaysian Rating Corp Bhd (MARC) should also be able to help shorten the time now taken to rate new debt issues, he said at the launching ceremony of the institution.</p>
<p>MARC, which started operations in June this year, will complement the role currently played by Rating Agency Malaysia (RAM), which was established in 1990.</p>
<p>Because of the large interest here in bond issues, RAM has faced criticism that it has at times taken weeks to decide the ratings of new securities.</p>
<p>"I hope that with the existence of two rating institutions, levels of professionalism at the two agencies will be raised," said Anwar, who is also finance minister.</p>
<p>"If previously there were complaints that debt securities were issued late, it is hoped that this will not be raised again with the existence of two rating institutions," Anwar said.</p>
<p>MARC has paid-up capital of 10 million ringgit. Its shareholders are the major life and general insurance companies, stockbrokers and discount houses.  </p>
<p>MARC on Thursday signed a technical cooperation agreement with New-York based rating agency Thomson BankWatch.</p>
<p>Anwar, who wants to turn Malaysia into a regional financial centre, said he envisaged the establishment of an active secondary debt securities market in the country.</p>
<p>"An effective debt securities market can only be created if there is an active secondary market. And, this does not exist in Malaysia now," he said.</p>
<p>In 1995, trade in medium- and long-term bonds totalled only 4.6 billion ringgit, or 23 percent of the total bonds issued.</p>
<p>"This shows the non-liquidity of the private debt securities market due to the preference by investors to hold the debt securities until maturity date, and also the lack of offers of such securities in the market," Anwar said.</p>
<p>"At present, most of the debt securities are issued through private placement and, as such, very little information is available when they are issued," he added.</p>
<p>The non-existence of benchmark bonds locally would also jeopardise development of a private secondary debt securities market, he said.</p>
