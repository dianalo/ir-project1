<p>The Australian share market reached new peaks on Wednesday before an avalanche of afternoon profit-taking wiped out most of the early gains by the close</p>
<p>The All Ordinaries index added 8.9 points to 2,488.0 after touching a record high of 2,515.1 shortly after the market opened. This surpassed the previous record high of 2,508.3 reached on February 19, 1997.</p>
<p>While the market proved unable to capture the heady levels above 2,500, traders remained impressed by the day's showing.</p>
<p>"It's had a fantastic run," said Greg Matthews, executive director of Australian equities at Mercantile Mutual Investment Management Ltd, as he pointed to the market's dramatic rise in the last fortnight.</p>
<p>Since its most recent low of 2,349.1 on April 14, the benchmark All Ordinaries index has climbed nearly six percent to today's closing levels.</p>
<p>Matthews was upbeat on the index's prospects, saying while it may take a little time to capture and hold the territory above 2,500, the uptrend could accelerate once it did.</p>
<p>"It will be a pretty exciting event once it goes through to those new highs. People will all start revising their upside targets," Matthews said.</p>
<p>Bellwether BHP flagged after a lightning start, ending up 1.2 percent at A$18.08 (US$14.10), as investors reflected on when benefits from Tuesday's steel restructuring might flow.</p>
<p>"There has been a few negative comments on BHP after the euphoria of yesterday and this morning. People are doing their numbers in a more sober light and you are now actually seeing some downgradings," Matthews said.</p>
<p>Sydney Harbour Casino missed the party at the opening and never got into the mood, its shares ending down two cents at A$2.16 after an early low of A$2.10 on newspaper reports that Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting could withdraw from its offer to buy control of the casino.</p>
<p>However, after trading closed Sydney Harbour Casino chief executive officer Neil Gamble told Reuters that The Australian's newspaper article was "totally inaccurate" and that Publishing and Broadcasting had indicated they were still going ahead with their planned purchase of management control.</p>
<p>ICI Australia jumped sharply to an intraday high of A$12.80 after reporting a 19.5 percent jump in first half net profit to A$110.7 million but the chemical group came in for the same selling that afflicted the rest of the market in the afternoon session and ended five cents lower at A$12.04.</p>
<p>Rises outnumbered falls by a ratio of about six to five, while about 32 percent of stocks traded remained steady.</p>
<p>(A$1=US$0.78)</p>
