<p>Scientists warned that activity within Montserrat's rumbling volcano remained dangerously high on Friday, two days after a surge of ultra-hot rocks and gas killed at least six people on the Caribbean island.</p>
<p>Government authorities said 17 people were still missing on the island, which is a British territory.</p>
<p>"Further pyroclastic flow activity is expected, and the high level of activity means that these flows could happen at any time and may be of significant size," the team monitoring the Soufriere Hills volcano, located in the southern part of the island, said on Friday morning.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, part of the giant dome of volcanic material that has been growing inside the volcano collapsed, dousing much of Montserrat with ash and sending a pyroclastic flow -- a fast-moving rain of superheated gases, ash and rock -- toward the eastern side of the island.</p>
<p>The flow burned all or part of seven villages -- authorities calculated that 175 homes and other properties were destroyed. At least five people were seriously injured, with four airlifted by helicopter to the nearby island of Guadeloupe and the fifth, the most seriously harmed, taken to Martinique by helicopter.</p>
<p>Searchers combing the affected area on Thursday discovered six bodies of people whose deaths were blamed on the volcano, its first victims since it roared to life in July 1995 after nearly four centuries of virtual dormancy.</p>
<p>Those injured and killed on Wednesday were believed to be people who had refused to heed an evacuation order for the southern and eastern portion of the island in effect for 14 months, or those who had made regular visits to check on their property and feed animals they had had to leave behind when leaving for friends' and relatives' homes or shelters in the island's northern "safe zone."</p>
<p>Search and rescue operations were continuing on Friday in the villages, which government officials said remained covered with as much as 10 to 15 feet (3 to 4.5 metres) of ash.</p>
<p>Montserrat's airport, which was evacuated on Wednesday, remained closed. No date for its reopening was set.</p>
<p>Monserrat is a British colony in the eastern Caribbean, about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Antigua. It now has about 6,800 residents, a third lower than the 11,000 it had when the volcano first became active.</p>
