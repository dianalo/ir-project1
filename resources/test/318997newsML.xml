<p>British Farm Minister Douglas Hogg said on Monday that Britain will present plans to the European Union in early February to exempt herds free of mad cow disease from a worldwide EU ban on British beef exports.</p>
<p>The EU imposed the export ban in March 1996 after the British government caused consumer panic by disclosing that madcow disease -- Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) -- can be transmitted to humans as Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (CJD).</p>
<p>Hogg said the British parliament will on Tuesday debate the plans, previously expected late January and which, if accepted, would be the first step in easing the export ban following a compromise reached at an EU summit in Florence last June.</p>
<p>"We wouldn't want to put forward a working document until the House of Commons has approved the Orders. That'll be tomorrow night. We'll be putting forward the working document I anticipate in early February," Hogg told Reuters.</p>
<p>Hogg, in Brussels for a half-day meeting of EU farm ministers, denied that the certified herd scheme would allow Northern Irish exporters to grab Scottish markets.</p>
<p>"I don't think that's the proper way to look at it," he said. "We...will be putting forward proposals, which are UK-wide both in terms of definition and...application."</p>
<p>"But it is certainly true and the point has been made before that Northern Ireland is well placed to take advantage of the certified herds scheme," he added.</p>
<p>This is because Northern Irish herds are mainly grass-fed and their details and movements are recorded on a computerised system.</p>
<p>Scottish herds are not yet recorded on a computer data base while English and Welsh herds have in addition been more exposed to contaminated feed containing meat and bone meal.</p>
<p>After Britain has presented the working document, it will be examined by various EU scientific and veterinary committees before the European Commission takes a final decision -- a process which could take months.</p>
