<p>The Dutch government confirmed a proposed night-time takeoff ban on noisy wide-body aircraft will take effect from tomorrow August 5.</p>
<p>The ban put forward by Schiphol airport had originally been due to take effect from August 1 but was delayed due to strong criticism from airlines and airfreight interests at the airport.</p>
<p>Additionally the government has now asked Schiphol to produce by September 1 an even tougher plan to keep noise levels within legal limits, the transport ministry said on Monday.</p>
<p>If the new plan was not adequate, transport minister Annemarie Jorritsma would consider sanctions which could include shutting all or part of the airport, the ministry said.</p>
<p>The first ban affects night-time take-offs of most wide-body aircraft -- such as McDonnell Douglas DC 10s and Boeing 747 100s, 200s and 300s and the Boeing 747SP -- from tomorrow and will operate between 2300 and 0600 (2100 to 0400 GMT).</p>
<p>A spokeswoman at Schiphol airport said they were aware of the Dutch government's objections to the current plan, but said it was too early to comment.</p>
<p>Dutch carrier KLM, Schiphol's biggest user, said last week the current restrictions were too stringent and could be relaxed without breaking legal noise limits.</p>
