<p>English premier league club Everton have protested to soccer's world governing body FIFA about a behind-the-scenes bid to take Ukranian forward Andrei Kanchelskis to Italy's Fiorentina.</p>
<p>"We have lodged an official complaint with FIFA about an Italian agent," Everton spokesman Alan Myers said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Everton say the agent, claiming to represent the Italian Cup holders, broke FIFA regulations by contacting Kanchelskis regarding a move to Italy even though the 27-year-old forward still has three years left on his contract at Goodison Park.</p>
<p>Under FIFA rules, clubs and agents can only approach players regarding transfer deals during the final six months of their contracts.</p>
<p>Myers said Fiorentina had not made an official bid for Kanchelskis, Everton's top scorer last season with 16 league goals, and any bid in the near future would be turned down.</p>
<p>"Andrei's got three years left on his official contract and as far as we're concerned he'll be seeing them out," he said.</p>
<p>Kanchelskis joined Everton in August 1995 from Manchester United for 5.0 million pounds ($7.8 million) following lengthy negotiations that soured relationships between the two clubs.</p>
