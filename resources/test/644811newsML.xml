<p>China witnessed fewer marriages and more divorces than usual last year, the China Daily said on Friday, quoting the Ministry of Civil Affairs.</p>
<p>Official statistics showed that 9.34 million couples registered their marriages in 1996 while 1.13 million couples split up in the courts or official marriage registration agencies, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>Analysis of the statistics showed the national marriage rate slipped 0.05 per thousand from 1995 to 7.7 per thousand, it said.</p>
<p>The divorce rate climbed 0.1 per thousand to 1.9 per thousand across the nation, and soared to a record seven per thousand in the remote western region of Xinjiang, it said.</p>
<p>Analysts found the marriage rate falling all across China, except in the Himalayan region of Tibet and on the southern tropical island province of Hainan.</p>
<p>Hainan's marriage rate could have been boosted by an influx of young economic migrants, the newspaper quoted sociologists as saying.</p>
<p>The number of Chinese marrying foreigners in 1996 rose to 47,227, up 7.2 percent from 1995, the newspaper said. It did not give details.</p>
