<headline>NZ govt to sell Works for over $80 million - sources.</headline>
<dateline>WELLINGTON 1996-08-27</dateline>

<p>The government would announce the sale of Works and Development Services Corporation Ltd (Workscorp) on Tuesday for over NZ$80 million, government and corporate sources said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The frontrunner to buy the corporation's construction arm is Downer Construction, owned by Brierley Investments Ltd 23 percent-owned associate Hong Kong-listed Paul Y-ITC.</p>
<p>The corporation's consultancy arm is expected to go to a separate bidder.  </p>
<p>The total sale price was likely to be above book value of about $80 million the government source said.</p>
<p>Downer earlier bought subsidiary Works Geothermal for an undisclosed sum.</p>
<p>A news briefing by State-Owned Enterprises Minister Philip Burdon is scheduled for 3.30 p.m. (0330 GMT).</p>
<p>The corporation, which evolved from the former Ministry of Works and Development, is the last asset sale flagged by the government that has yet to be resolved.  </p>
<p>Last week, the government announced the sale of Forestry Corporation for a net NZ$1.6 billion and in July indefinitely postponed the sale of the bulk of the property portfolio held by Government Property Services.</p>
<p>By comparison with other government asset sales Workscorp is small. It had shareholders' funds of $98.5 million dollars, according to the interim report for the six months to December 31, 1995. But since then it has sold Works Geothermal.</p>
<p>Burdon announced in February the corporation, consisting of the remaining two subsidiaries, would be sold.  </p>
<p>He said there was no reason to retain ownership and in a competitive market a publicly-owned player provided taxpayers with no particular benefits.</p>
<p>The main opposition Labour Party has not taken a public position on the sale.</p>
<p>Economic nationalist party New Zealand First is opposed.</p>
<p>A spokesman for left wing Alliance leader Jim Anderton said there was no good reason for the sale.  </p>
<p>"One of the most insidious aspects is the loss of expertise in Workscorp when an incoming Alliance government would be committed to repairing the neglect in infrastructure and to the environment," he said.</p>
<p>A government source on Tuesday said the current book value was around $80 million with a sale price slightly above that figure likely.</p>
<p>Writing in the interim report chairman Basil Logan said subsidiary Works Civil Construction had benefited from local authorities' focus on the efficient use of ratepayers' money.  </p>
<p>He said the company provided services more cost-effectively than local bodies' historical "in-house" delivery services.</p>
<p>The Works Consultancy Services subsidiary experienced strong growth both locally and overseas. It had won a major roading management contract with the Franklin District Council near Auckland and expected more work of that type from other local bodies.</p>
<p>He said strong competition was a feature of the industry.</p>
<p>In the year to June 1995 the corporation had total revenues of $280.3 million and after tax profit of $12.2 million.  </p>
<p>In the six months to December 1995 revenues were $145.3 million and profit after tax was $7.5 million.</p>
