<p>A German freighter was finally floated free on Thursday after spending 15 days grounded off Miami, the U.S. Coast Guard said.</p>
<p>The Igloo Moon ran aground on a sand bank in the environmentally sensitive Biscayne National Park about 3 miles (4.8 km) southeast of Key Biscayne, Florida, on November 6 after having somehow travelled 70 miles (112 km) off course.</p>
<p>Salvage efforts had been impeded by a run of rough weather and the freighter's cargo -- thousands of gallons of butadiene, a flammable chemical.</p>
<p>The cargo was unloaded to another vessel on Wednesday and the Igloo Moon was floated free of the sand bank as of 2:47 p.m. EST (1947 GMT) Thursday, a spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard said.</p>
<p>There was no pollution from the grounding.</p>
