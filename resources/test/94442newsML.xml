<p>A trio of oil companies on Wednesday announced plans to jointly develop a new major oil field on Alaska's North Slope, assuring the state will remain a major source of U.S. crude oil into the next century.</p>
<p>Atlantic Richfield Co's Arco Alaska Inc, Anadarko Petroleum Corp, and Union Texas Petroleum said they expect to spend up to $800 million over the next four years to develop "Alpine," a 10-mile (16 km) long, 40,000-acre (16,190 hectares) field 34 miles (55 km) west of Kuparuk.</p>
<p>Arco discovered Alpine in 1994, four years after the last major North Slope find and has spent the last two years trying to determine its commercial viability.</p>
<p>Alaska, which comprises a quarter of U.S. oil production, has seen output fall to less than 1.5 million barrels per day (bpd) from 2.0 million (bpd) in 1988.</p>
<p>The Alpine oilfield, located in the Colville River delta, is expected to start producing 30,000 barrels of oil a day in 2000.</p>
<p>The companies plan to begin construction and development of the field late next year or early in 1998, pending receipt of local, state and federal permits. Production is expected to double to about 60,000 barrels daily in 2001.</p>
<p>Arco owns 56 percent of the partnership, with Anadarko and Union Texas each holding 22 percent.</p>
<p>Oil analysts said Arco's share of the project would provide a much-needed boost to its oil reserves, adding about 6 percent to Arco's Alaskan reserves.</p>
<p>"It's part of Arco's effort to grow their production and offset production decline they will experience," by 2000, said Adam Sieminski, senior analyst at NatWest Securites.</p>
<p>Arco officials said the field is a key part of the company's efforts to maintain production from Alaska.</p>
<p>"Alaska's most active and number one oil explorer is back on track," Ken Thompson, president of Arco Alaska Inc told employees at company headquarters in Anchorage.</p>
<p>Thompson said Alpine could serve as an example for how  oil companies could safely develop Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge or other sites that are currently off limits to the oil industry.</p>
<p>"Perhaps that could be a model to have them reconsider opening ANWR or NRPA," he said referring to the 23 million-acre (9.3 million hectare) National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska on the western border of the Alpine disovery.</p>
<p>Alpine's discovery is also a positive development for two companies who have been outside Alaska's cadre of oil producers.</p>
<p>Union Texas, which began exploring Colville 1984 with Texaco, will now add 5,000 bpd of crude oil production by 2000. The company has reserves of 55,000 bpd wordwide, with the core business in Indonesian liquid natural gas.</p>
<p>The Alaskan deal will ease the pain of falling cash flows from LNG production, forecast to decrease 10 percent next year.</p>
<p>And Houston-based Anandarko will also add 5,000 bpd, to a worldwide production of 20,000 bpd. Previously, the company had pinned cash flow hopes in Algeria, with production set to begin in 1998.</p>
