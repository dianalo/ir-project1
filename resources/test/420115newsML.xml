<p>U.S. Robotics Corp said its proposed merger with 3Com Corp will enable the company to create greater long-term value for shareholders by positioning the combined company as the leader in the fastest growing sectors of the networking market.</p>
<p>"This new company will change the landscape of the industry," said Casey Cowell, chairman and chief executive officer, said in remarks prepared for delivery to the company's annual shareholders meeting held here Wednesday.</p>
<p>U.S. Robotics and 3Com have signed a definitive agreement to merge in exchange of stock valued at about $7.3 billion.  </p>
<p>Cowell said customers were increasingly demanding more integrated networking solutions. The combined companies will be able to provide customers worldwide with comprehensive end-to-end LAN/WAN networking solutions -- from network interface cards and high-speed modems, through local area network workgroup and enterprise switching solutions, to remote access and wide area networking solutions, he said.</p>
<p>"U.S. Robotics shareholders will own roughly half, or about 48 percent of the new 3Com," Cowell said in a statement. "So the upside potential is there for all of our shareholders, and we think that this combination will greatly increase our prospects of realizing that potential."</p>
<p>Referring to the company's new x2 fast modem, Cowell said "We are extremely pleased with the market's acceptance of this technology."</p>
<p>Shares of U.S. Robotics, which supplies products and systems that provide access to information, were trading up 1-7/8 at 59-1/4.</p>
