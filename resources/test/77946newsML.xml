<p>NWE gasoline barges were steady to firmer on Thursday but activity was thin, traders said.</p>
<p>Eurograde barges changed hands at $207.50 fob ARA and prices were quoted at similar levels for most of the day.</p>
<p>Regular barges were not heard traded but the market was assessed some $9 below Eurograde.</p>
<p>A mixed Eurograde/leaded cargo was heard to have been sold out of Antwerp but the price was not known. The cargo was thought likely to be moving to the Thames.</p>
