<p>U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley hailed a conference of 40 government ministers about the Internet as a success on Tuesday, saying there was broad agreement private enterprise must lead regulation in the sector.</p>
<p>Daley acknowledged there were differences on some issues, particularly over how to regulate encryption technology but said these were far outweighed by the consensus on most points among ministers and industry leaders at the Bonn conference.</p>
<p>"I think it's been a huge success because we seem to be in agreement on about 98 percent of the principles," he told a news conference as the two-day congress drew to a close.</p>
<p>Daley called on industry to seize the opportunity governments were offering by keeping regulation low.</p>
<p>"If governments take the position that their involvement should be minimal, then it is up to the private sector to lead in many of these areas," he said. "If they don't, then the most important thing that will happen is that consumers will not have confidence and trust."</p>
<p>Daley cautioned that if the general public did not trust the Internet, cyber-commerce would not become the engine for economic growth that many experts predict.</p>
<p>He conceded there was a difference of opinion on encryption, or technology that lets companies and individuals protect messages and transactions on the Internet by encoding them.</p>
<p>While some companies say they must be free to develop and use their own encryption technology, some governments have said the state must be able to decipher such codes in case they are being used for criminal purposes.</p>
<p>The United States heavily restricts export of encryption technology and requires companies to provide a so-called key that would allow law enforcement officials to "recover," or decode, encrypted messages.</p>
<p>France has virtually outlawed use of encryption software, while Germany has leaned towards keeping such coding and decoding software unregulated. But there are deep divisions within Germany's government over the issue, and no policy exists yet.</p>
<p>"We did not come here in the anticipation that on the issue of encryption, we would get standing ovations," Daley said."We feel very strongly that there must be a balance between encrypting products to protect them and legitimate law enforcement and security concerns."</p>
<p>Daley said all the ministers he had spoken to at the conference agreed there had to be such a balance. The disagreements arose over what sort of balance was acceptable.</p>
<p>He acknowledged that while Washington was generally in favour of less red tape on the Internet, its position on encryption meant some sort of regulation was necessary.</p>
<p>"There are certain legitimate areas where government has to be involved," he said. "There's nothing in you life, except maybe breathing, that government isn't involved in in some way. And even then, it has to be involved to make sure it's (the air) clean."</p>
