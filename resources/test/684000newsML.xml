<p>Anglo-French government talks on possibly extending Eurotunnel Plc's concession to run the Channel Tunnel resumed on Tuesday, a UK Department of Transport official told Reuters.</p>
<p>The first joint meeting between both governments' officials since the British and French elections was held in Paris this morning, with another scheduled for this afternoon.</p>
<p>"The two governments met earlier this morning in Paris and are meeting this afternoon...But they can't be bound by the timetable set(by Eurotunnel's extraordinary general meeting on July 10)," she said.  </p>
<p>Earlier on Tuesday, Eurotunnel said it hoped for an agreement in principle with both governments on extending its concession before its crucial EGM meeting on July 10, when shareholders will vote on the restructuring plan for its near nine billion pounds in debt.</p>
<p>The DOT in London told Reuters it could not say whether an agreement could be reached with the French government in time for Eurotunnel's make-or-break EGM.</p>
<p>The talks started last October after calls from Eurotunnel to extend its concession beyond the 65-year term which ends in 2052. But the discussions were put back by British and French elections, held in recent months.  </p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Eurotunnel in London was unaware talks had resumed between the two governments. She said although Eurotunnel had asked for a concession extention to 999 years from 65 years, it had already conceded that it would be grateful for any improvement on the current term.</p>
<p>"Anything is better than nothing," she said.</p>
<p>Eurotunnel hoped an extention would help secure support for its restructuring plans which were facing stiff opposition from French shareholders in particular.</p>
