<p>UK shares were expected to open lower on Friday, with politically-sensitive utility stocks leading the decline in the wake of a landslide victory for the Labour Party in the general election.</p>
<p>"Clearly the trend is down," said Jeremy Batstone, head of research at NatWest Stockbrokers. "But it's not looking like a blood bath."</p>
<p>Dealers said the FTSE 100 index of leading shares would open around 50 points easier after setting a record close of 4,445 on Thursday.  </p>
<p>Investors were also seen anxious about the U.S. April employment report and its possible influence on interest rate policy. The Dow ended 32.51 points lower on Thursday at 6,976.48.</p>
<p>City bookmaker IG Index was quoting a spread of 4,405-13 for the FTSE's Friday close.</p>
<p>The resounding victory for Labour came as a shock to financial markets. The projected final tally of seats according to the BBC was 419 to Labour compared with 166 to the Conservatives.  </p>
<p>"The result was very different from the expected 30-100 seats (majority)," one dealer said.</p>
<p>In sparse overnight trading, utilities stocks were marked down around two to three percent as investors began to fret over the size of the promised windfall tax. Financials were also weak.</p>
<p>"Undoubtedly a large majority is going to cause people to think twice about the market. It's no great surprise but people will start to think carefully about things like utilities," said Andy Hartwill, UK equity strategist at SocGen.  </p>
<p>Nigel Hawkins, utilities analyst at Yamaichi commented that "overseas holders may see opportunities to invest elsewhere in Europe."</p>
<p>Chancellor of the Exchequer-in-waiting Gordon Brown was expecting to honour the monthly monetary meeting scheduled for May 7 which analysts predict will result in a 1/4 point rise in UK interest rates.</p>
<p>Gordon Brown said early Friday that he will stick to the Conservatives inflation target of 2.5 percent. The new government will hold its first budget within two months.  </p>
<p>Gilts sagged under the weight of profit-taking but dealers expected losses to be capped. Sterling advanced versus the mark.</p>
<p>But with two months to wait for the first Labour budget and further details of corporate taxation plans, attention was likely to turn to events in the U.S and key economic data.</p>
<p>"If the non-farm payrolls is higher than expected it will raise fears of a U.S. rate hike and that could be the double hit that does quite a bit of damage," Batstone said.</p>
<p>"Whether we end up or down on the day may depend on the U.S. data more than anything else," agreed NatWest Securities strategist Bob Semple.</p>
