<p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin Thursday reiterated his support for a strong dollar, saying it was in the U.S. interest.</p>
<p>"Our policy remains the same. A strong dollar is in our economic interests," he told reporters, adding, "The dollar is not to be used as an instrument of trade policy."</p>
<p>The financial markets have been rife with speculation about a shift in U.S. dollar policy after senior Japanese official Eisuke Sakakibara told a newspaper last week that the dollar's rise against the yen was about to come to an end.</p>
<p>That speculation was fanned on Thursday by a newspaper report that influential private economist Fred Bergsten is being considered for a top post in President Clinton's second administration. Bergsten has in the past called for a weaker dollar to help cut the big U.S. trade deficit.</p>
<p>Rubin declined to comment on the Bergsten report. "There are all kinds of names being bandied about," he said. "I don't think I should comment on individuals."</p>
<p>He also declined comment on whether he would stay on as Treasury chief in a second Clinton term. However, sources close to the Secretary confirmed that he would.  </p>
<p>Rubin's comments on the dollar came in the wake of a series of remarks by Japanese and European officials Thursday that seemed designed to talk the U.S. currency back up.</p>
<p>Asked if the barrage of comments were a coordinated effort to buttress the dollar after Sakakibara's remarks knocked it lower last week, Rubin said, "I can't speak to the rest of them ... As far as I know, at least, we haven't been coordinating with anybody about anything."</p>
<p>Sakakibara also said last week that he thought the financial markets were taking an overly pessimistic view about the Japanese economy.</p>
<p>Rubin declined comment on that, although he did reiterate America's "very strong interest" in a strong Japanese economy led by domestic demand.</p>
<p>The Treasury chief made his remarks on the dollar in response to questions at the end of a briefing on next week's meeting here between U.S. and Chinese economic policymakers.</p>
