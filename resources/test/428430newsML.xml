<p>Springbok scrum-half Joost van der Westhuizen scored two tries to lead Northern Transvaal to a 14-3 victory over Queensland at Loftus Versfeld on Saturday.</p>
<p>Van der Westhuizen opened the scoring with a brilliant solo effort from the halfway line when he recovered a chip ahead to score near the posts.</p>
<p>He scored an opportunist's try late in the half when he pounced on the ball which squirted loose from a five-metre scrum.</p>
<p>Wallaby skipper John Eales had a nightmare evening missing four out of five kicks at goal, three of them simple shots.</p>
<p>Northerns led 14-3 at half-time and fly-half Theo van Rensburg caught Eales's disease missing four kicks in the second period.</p>
<p>Eales surrendered the kicking duties after his fourth miss in the 47th minute, but his replacement Shane Drahm could do no better hitting the post with another straight forward effort.</p>
<p>Queensland, the 1995 champions, looked anything but title contenders until an injury to winger Barry Lea in the 54th minute forced them to make a positional switch.</p>
<p>Tim Horan moved from full-back to centre and the Wallaby genius immediately sparked a host of threatening backline moves.</p>
<p>But eventually Queensland's handling errors let them down and they will have much cause for concern ahead of their last game in South Africa against Free State in Bloemfontein next Saturday.</p>
