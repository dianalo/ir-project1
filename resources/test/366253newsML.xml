<p>The defence lawyer of former Wimbledon goalkeeper Hans Segers showed video film on Monday to try to prove that his client could not have thrown soccer matches for money.</p>
<p>After each video snippet showing all the goals and saves against Wimbledon in each match, lawyer Desmond Da Silva asked Segers whether there had been anything he could have done to save the goals he missed.</p>
<p>"If I had been standing on the other corner, yes," said Segers of one goal. But he said most of the rest had been lost causes.</p>
<p>Da Silva told the court that Wimbledon had lost or drawn 14 matches in a row in the 1995/96 season while Segers was recovering from a knee operation. When Segers returned in late December, the team started winning again.</p>
<p>"That was a nice Christmas present," said Segers.</p>
<p>Segers is accused along with former Liverpool goalkeeper Bruce Grobbelaar, former Aston Villa striker John Fashanu and a Malaysian businessman, Heng Suan Lim, of rigging the results of soccer matches in England's premier league.</p>
<p>All four deny the charges and say that they were only involved in forecasting the outcome of matches for a group of wealthy gamblers in the Far East.</p>
<p>Segers earlier said he had told police "absolute rubbish" when he was arrested last year, because he was trying to hide his extra-marital affairs and the fact that he had been forecasting match results.</p>
<p>He said he had only learned a few days before his arrest that it was against English Football Association rules to forecast match results.</p>
<p>He feared heavy penalties if he was caught out and so he told police that the large sums he was paying into his Swiss bank account came from selling stolen cars.</p>
<p>The prosecution says that Segers received around 100,000 pounds ($160,000) from Lim, to whom he had been introduced by Fashanu, for throwing matches.</p>
<p>It has produced phone bills and bank accounts to show that Lim, Segers and Fashanu were in constant touch before big matches and that afterwards, Segers paid large sums into his Swiss account.</p>
<p>Segers explained his frequent telephone conversations with Fashanu by saying that both were having extramarital affairs and were arranging to cover for each other if their wives called.</p>
<p>"I played a few away matches," said Segers, referring to his own affairs. "I asked John quite a lot to cover for me."</p>
<p>Segers, who declined to have a lawyer present during police interviews, said most of his income outside football came from a business, Ties International, which he owned jointly with a Dutch friend. He was also involved in property deals with Fashanu, he said.</p>
<p>He said he received the proceeds from both of these ventures in cash, and this was the money he paid into his bank account.</p>
<p>But because he did not want to reveal that he had been evading taxes, he told police that the money in the Swiss account had been transferred from Jersey, another tax haven.</p>
<p>"Is the tax man interested in your affairs," Da Silva asked him.</p>
<p>"I think so," said Segers, smiling and pointing to a man at the back of the court. "I think that is Mr Taxman there." ($1=.6120 Pound)</p>
