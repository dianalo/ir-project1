<p>The dollar is likely to maintain a firm tone against the yen in Asia on Tuesday, supported by buying interest from Japanese importers and trust banks, traders said.</p>
<p>Traders said they will be watching to see if the dollar can breach the 200-day moving average of 117.97 yen, which is widely seen as a key resistance point.</p>
<p>"The dollar is likely to continue edging higher, but the speed of its upward move could be slowed by offers from Japanese exporters and institutional investors," said a trader at a trust bank.  </p>
<p>The dollar closed at 117.78/88 yen in New York on Monday, after rising as high as 117.90 yen. Against the German currency, the greenback ended at 1.8415/25 marks in New York.</p>
<p>"Earlier in Monday's New York session, the dollar briefly slipped below 117 yen on selling by U.S. funds, but the dollar was underpinned at the lows by bids from Japanese trust banks," said a trader at a city bank.</p>
<p>If the dollar continues to climb towards 120 yen, however, the market may start to get nervous about the possibility of Japanese financial authorities expressing displeasure with yen weakness, traders said.  </p>
<p>The dollar is also expected to be well-supported against the mark, although a test of 1.85 marks is considered unlikely during Asian trading hours, traders said.</p>
<p>The dollar rose as high as 1.8490 marks in New York on Monday, its highest level since it traded at 1.8690 in November 1989. The 1989 cycle topped out at 2.0478.</p>
<p>"Dollar/mark should remain well-bid. People are now more cautious about pushing the dollar higher versus the mark, however, as the Bundesbank left open the possibility for a change to a variable repo rate from the current fixed repo rate," said the city bank trader.</p>
