<p>Thai Danu Bank Plc said on Wednesday that the bank had delayed its planned $130 million floating rate certificate of deposit issue because of its planned merger with Finance One Plc.</p>
<p>"The arrangers of our FRCD suggested us to delay the syndication because the environment has been changing (after the announcement of the merger)," Satian Tantanasarit, vice president at Thai Danu Bank told Reuters.  </p>
<p>He said all arrangers of the issue were awaiting details of the merger before resuming work on the deal.</p>
<p>"In my opinion, the details and picture of the merger will be much clearer within this week," Satian said.</p>
<p>Thai Danu had mandated the arrangers of its planned $130 million FRCD late last month and expected the FRCD to be completed in March.</p>
<p>Medium-sized bank Thai Danu and the nation's largest finance firm, Finance One, earlier this month announced a friendly merger in line with a government policy to strengthen the finance sector.</p>
<p>They are now awaiting approval from regulators for the planned merger, although verbal support for the joining of the two entities has been warmly welcomed by the government and the central bank.</p>
