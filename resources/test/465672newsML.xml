<p>Botswana said on Tuesday it had submitted a proposal to an international body overseeing endangered animal trade to sell 25 tonnes of stockpiled ivory.</p>
<p>Botswana will join four other southern African countries at the Convention of Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in Zimbabwe in June to call for a 1989 ban on ivory trade to be lifted.</p>
<p>South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique all have large elephant populations which often devastate their environment and herds have to be culled to keep numbers down.</p>
<p>Botswana's 30-tonne ivory stockpile is the result of natural deaths and ivory seized from poachers and illegal traders.</p>
<p>The countries hope to convince governments and conservationists at the convention that the ban merely drives trade underground. They plan to propose that ivory collected from periodic culls be auctioned under tight controls instead.</p>
<p>Botswana said it would propose to transfer its elephant population from the convention's section which bans trade in elephant products to its section which allows limited trade.</p>
<p>The proposal needs support by two-thirds of the 130 CITES member countries to be approved.</p>
<p>Botswana said it had a Japanese buyer -- which it refused to name -- for the ivory. A similar move by Botswana in 1992, involving another buyer, was defeated.</p>
<p>"The buyer has agreed not to re-export the ivory, nor products made from it," Botswana Department of Wildlife deputy director Joseph Matlhare told Reuters.</p>
<p>"There is enough demand for ivory in Japan for it to be absorbed locally," he added.</p>
<p>Botswana has proposed that the trade of the ivory, envisaged to be in two direct shipments in 1998 and 1999, should be monitored by CITES officials. Tusks would be marked and registered.</p>
<p>"We stress that we want only to reduce our stockpile," Matlhare said. "There will be no killing, nor culling, nor has there been in the building up of the stockpile, apart from where we have had to protect villages from attack by elephants."</p>
<p>Matlhare would not discuss what price the ivory would fetch, but said there had been bids from $250 to $500 per kg.</p>
