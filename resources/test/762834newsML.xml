<p>Jakarta stocks ended higher on Tuesday as investors bought back several blue chip stocks, particularly Telkom and Bank Negara Indonesia, on the back of a stable rupiah, brokers said.</p>
<p>The Jakarta Composite Index was up 0.78 percent, 5.54 points to 716.36 points. Gainers led losers by 65 to 59, with 76 counters unchanged. Total volume was estimated at 395 billion rupiah.</p>
<p>Brokers said prevailing prices of some stocks such as Bank Negara and Telkom had provided a buying opportunity for investors.  </p>
<p>Telkom closed 125 rupiah higher at 4,025 rupiah on a volume of about 1.6 million shares, while Bank Negara was up 50 rupiah at 1,475 rupiah on a volume of 5.3 million shares.</p>
<p>"The strenghtening of the Indonesian rupiah today had given support to overall market sentiment," said Vera Marpaung, a broker with Asean Development Securities.</p>
<p>However, she said most investors, particularly foreigners, remained concerned about the currency and were awaiting further stability before resuming large-scale buying.</p>
<p>However, other analysts said some were using the current bout of stability to hunt for bargains.  </p>
<p>They said overall trading was sluggish, as reflected by the small turnover.</p>
<p>"The market needs more positive news to move on," a broker with a local firm said, predicting that index would be stable at current levels on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Local-led active buying was seen on property firm Royal Sentul Highlands or Bukit Sentul. It topped the active list with about 38 million shares traded, up 25 to 650 rupiah.</p>
<p>Finance company Putra Surya Multidana also attracted market attention on the belief that it would post encouraging first-half results, brokers said.  </p>
<p>Just before closing time, the company announced it posted a first-half net profit of 101.07 billion rupiah, compared with 18.87 billion rupiah in the same 1996 period.</p>
<p>Putra closed up 25 rupiah to 3,750 rupiah on a volume of 912,500 shares. -- Jakarta newsroom +6221 384-6364</p>
