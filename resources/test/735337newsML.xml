<p>Young men with bulging muscles jogged down the streets of Monrovia on Thursday as Liberia's former warlords staged final campaign rallies for presidential elections on Saturday.</p>
<p>The streets of the war-battered West African capital vibrated with the chant of groups of hundreds of young men and women, many of them militia fighters in Liberia's seven-year civil war.</p>
<p>Most visible were supporters of Charles Taylor, the man who started the civil war in December 1989 and who is widely seen as the likely winner in a field of 12 bidding for president.</p>
<p>Taylor supporters -- mostly teenagers well below the legal voting age of 18 -- swarmed through the capital's main street sporting white T-shirts with Taylor's portrait printed in gold.</p>
<p>"We want Taylor," chanted a group of girls heading for their candidate's rally at the main stadium.</p>
<p>Supporters of Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, the only woman candidate for president, were also visible in their green scarves over white T-shirts.</p>
<p>Johnson-Sirleaf, 58, joined the political race in Liberia belatedly from her job as a senior United Nations official in New York. She has quickly built up support among middle class Liberians determined to prevent a warlord winning power and is rated as Taylor's toughest rival.</p>
<p>Taylor's supporters shouted obscenities against Johnson-Sirleaf when they marched past her campaign headquarters.</p>
<p>Johnson-Sirleaf's followers there hurled back anti-Taylor slogans, harking back to the suffering in the civil war in the country founded by freed American slaves in 1847.</p>
<p>"We want Ellen, no more Taylor. We want Ellen, no more looting. No more raping," they chanted.</p>
<p>The presidential contenders were reduced to 12 on Thursday after the Supreme Court disqualified George Toe Washington and stopped him from further campaigning, electoral officials said.</p>
<p>The court announced its decision on Wednesday following a petition by members of Washington's Peoples Democratic Party, accusing him of hijacking the party's leadership.</p>
<p>The elections, with a possible second round runoff two weeks later, wrap up a faltering peace process brokered by Liberia's West African neighbours on ending the civil war.</p>
<p>More than a dozen previous accords failed to halt fighting which killed more than 150,000 people and wrecked the economy.</p>
<p>The big question remains whether faction leaders who have fought each other for so long will respect the verdict of the electorate. Twenty-six senators and 64 lower house deputies will also be elected.</p>
<p>The runup to polling has been relatively peaceful but West African peacekeepers policing Liberia since 1990 put up a show of force on Wednesday to deter trouble makers.</p>
<p>The 10,500-strong force from 10 countries led by Nigeria paraded tanks and armoured cars through the streets of Monrovia while Nigerian air force fighter jets flew over the city.</p>
<p>Force commander General Victor Malu warned warlords at the weekend that his troops would go after any losing candidate who decides to challenge the poll results with violence.</p>
<p>Apart from Taylor, two other warlords are running for president -- Alhaji Kromah, who headed the second largest faction during the war, and George Boley, the highest ranking political figure in the Krahn tribe that dominated the power struggle in Liberia in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Kromah's power base is in his stronghold in northwestern Liberia, close to Sierra Leone and home to his predominantly Moslem Mandingo followers.</p>
<p>He was Taylor's main rival in the war, but many Liberians say his position has been weakened by the arrival of Johnson-Sirleaf. A runoff ballot, if it came to that, would most likely be between Taylor and Johnson-Sirleaf, they say.</p>
<p>The West has contributed funds for the elections, with the European Union alone providing $4 million. More than 50 poll observers from 14 EU nations fanned across Liberia on Thursday to monitor voting, an EU statement said.</p>
<p>Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter, heading his Carter Center team, will be the highest-ranking U.S. observer.</p>
