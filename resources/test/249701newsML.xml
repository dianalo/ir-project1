<p>The Irish EU Presidency will hand over a proposal to protect geographical food origins to the incoming Dutch presidency, an EU official said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The proposal failed to get through the Special Agriculture Committee on Tuesday and the Irish announced that they would be leaving it to the Dutch," the official said.</p>
<p>The Commission has proposed that the new rules should apply after a five year transitional period following publication in the EU Official Journal on July 25, 1997.</p>
<p>The original regulation 2081/92 set up a five year transitional period expiring in July next year.</p>
<p>The regulation protects food products with a specific geographic identity.</p>
<p>The proposal created controversy over the question of feta cheese which is traditionally made from sheep's milk in  Greece.</p>
<p>Denmark which has developed a major industry based on a feta type cheese made from cows' milk, has sought to delay the the measure for as long as possible.</p>
