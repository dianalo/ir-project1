<p>T/SF Communications Corp said Tuesday it had engaged Prudential Securities Inc to help it explore strategic alternatives, including a possible sale of its Transportation Information Services Inc unit.</p>
<p>The unit operates under the tradename "DAC Services" and provides pre-employment and other information services to the trucking insurance, casino and convenience store industries, T/SF said.  </p>
<p>T/SF, a business and information services company that produces trade journals, said its goal is to maximize the value of the unit "through a suitable transaction, either a sale or merger."</p>
<p>It said any deal is unlikely to be completed until mid-1997.</p>
<p>The DAC unit had revenues for the nine months ended September 30 of about $15.8 million, up from $13 million in the year-ago period, T/SF said.</p>
