<headline>IBM stock rises on upgrade, Dow rally.</headline>
<dateline>NEW YORK</dateline>
<text>
<p>The stock of International Business Machines Corp. rose in heavy trading Friday after Merrill Lynch said it could reach the $150-level in 12 months as earnings prospects improve.</p>
<p>The brokerage strongly recommended buying the shares, which rose $4.125 to $121.375 on the New York Stock Exchange, where it was the most active issue on volume of more than 2.3 million shares.</p>
<p>IBM also benefited as the stock market rallied after the government reported more proof that inflation is well under control, which eased worries over an interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch was not immediately available for comment, but traders said the Wall Street firm maintained its long-term strong buy rating on the stock. It previously recommended accumulating the stock for near-term gains.</p>
<p>The brokerage expects IBM's new mainframes and disk drives to reach meaningful volumes in the third and fourth quarters, traders said.</p>
