<p>Spain's Supreme Court ordered the government on Saturday to declassify secret spy documents purporting to show the former Socialist administration of Felipe Gonzalez ran death squads in a 1980s "dirty war" on ETA rebels.</p>
<p>Judges and officials have said the documents could provide evidence to reopen investigations on whether Gonzalez and his associates masterminded the GAL "anti-terrorist" squads to fight violent separatist group ETA (Basque Homeland and Freedom).</p>
<p>Though Supreme Court justices probing the death squads have so far decided against questioning Gonzalez, the scandal tainted the Socialists and contributed to their election defeat in March 1996 after 13 years in power.</p>
<p>The ruling, announced in a court communiqu, overturned a decision last year by Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's conservative government to keep the so-called CESID papers secret for reasons of state security.</p>
<p>After four days of deliberations, the 33 magistrates decided the government must open up 13 of 18 classified documents sought by three lower courts to prove Gonzalez's government was behind the campaign of torture and kidnapping in which 28 people were killed from 1983-1987.</p>
<p>ETA has killed some 800 people in its 29-year struggle for Basque independence from Spain.</p>
<p>Aznar's ruling Popular Party (PP) said it would abide by the court order.</p>
<p>"This demonstrates our country functions as a state of law," Ignacio Gil Lazaro, a PP spokesman for judicial affairs, said of the ruling.</p>
