<text>
<p>English premier league soccer club Newcastle United confirmed on Wednesday that it would announce details of its planned flotation on Thursday.</p>
<p>Press officer Graham Courtney said the club would issue a statement on the flotation on Thursday.</p>
<p>Newcastle said last month that it would release details of the transaction in mid-January ahead of a spring listing on the London Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>The shock resignation of manager Kevin Keegan last week risked disrupting the timetable but it was put back on track by the appointment of Kenny Dalglish 24 hours ago.</p>
