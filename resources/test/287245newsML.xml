<p>French club Brive booked their place in the European Cup final against Leicester with a fine 26-11 win over last year's beaten finalists Cardiff on Sunday.</p>
<p>Cardiff, who were hoping to play a second successive final on their home ground, also suffered the ignominy of seeing hooker and Welsh national captain Johnathan Humphreys sent off in the 53rd minute.</p>
<p>Brive, helped by the goalkicking of international centre Christophe Lamaison, scored two tries as they avenged the defeat on Saturday of another French team, the holders Toulouse who were crushed 37-11 at Leicester.</p>
<p>Their victory was amply deserved but it took time to materialise, mostly because of Lamaison's poor kicking during an ill-tempered first half which saw Humphreys and lock Derwyn Jones given the yellow card by Irish referee Brian Stirling.</p>
<p>Lamaison missed with four of his seven attempts at goal but the three others went safely over to give Brive a 9-3 lead at the break.</p>
<p>The frozen pitch did not favour attacking rugby but the losing finalists of last year's French championship tried their luck at running the ball in the second half.</p>
<p>But once again, Brive were too clumsy to convert their domination in points as prop Didier Casadei spilled the ball just short of the line after a furious charge in the 45th minute.</p>
<p>A minute later they got their reward when  international centre David Venditti broke away on his own to score the opening try.</p>
<p>Shortly after, centre Sebastien Carrat had the chance to add but, under pressure from veteran Cardiff fly-half Jonathan Davies, he also lost the ball with the line in his sights.</p>
<p>Cardiff's hopes of fighting back took a massive blow in the 53rd minute when Humphreys, after a series of punch-ups, received his marching orders and Jones had to make way for the replacement hooker David Young.</p>
<p>From the scrum which followed, Brive number eight Francois Duboisset crashed over for the second, decisive try.</p>
<p>Cardiff tried desperately to salvage some pride in the dying minutes and were awarded a penalty try in the 70th minute.</p>
<p>The final takes place at Cardiff Arms Park on January 25.</p>
