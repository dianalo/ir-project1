<p>Cameroon police dispersed demonstrators outside the supreme court building in the capital Yaounde on Friday as the court announced final results of parliamentary elections won by President Paul Biya's party.</p>
<p>The results of the May 17 election gave Biya's Cameroon People's Democratic Rally (RDPC) 109 seats in the 180-seat parliament, the court said.</p>
<p>The Social Democratic Front (SDF) of John Fru Ndi won 43 seats, the National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP) of Bello Bouba Maigari won 13, the Cameroon Democratic Union (UDC) five, and three small parties one each.</p>
<p>Results for seven seats in three constituencies were cancelled because of what the court described as "severe irregularities and massive fraud". It said voting would be repeated in Mayo Banyo and Mayo Rey in the north and in Nde in Western Province.</p>
<p>Police used truncheons to disperse opposition protesters chanting slogans outside the court. Eight people were detained and taken away. "Paul Biya has stolen our victory, we will get it back," shouted one protester.</p>
<p>International observers said the elections, the second since the advent of multi-party politics in 1990, were tarnished by problems and irregularities. Voters complained of problems obtaining voter cards.</p>
<p>The SDF and the UNDP have both called for results to be scrapped and urged their supporters to be prepared to defend their rights.</p>
<p>The SDF said three of its supporters were shot dead by Biya loyalists in the southwestern town of Kumba on May 20 in the aftermath of the elections.</p>
<p>The Front's stronghold is the English-speaking North-West Province, a flashpoint in largely French-speaking Cameroon, but it also draws support from Cameroon's main ethnic Bamileke group and the urban poor.</p>
<p>Front leader Fru Ndi lost narrowly to Biya in the 1992 presidential election, which the opposition says was rigged. The Front polled well during January municipal elections, taking the nation's biggest city, the port of Douala.</p>
<p>Presidential elections are due in October.</p>
