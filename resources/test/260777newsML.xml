<p>Diversified British engineer FKI Plc on Tuesday dismissed a rejection by its bid target Newman Tonks Group, saying the company was asking shareholders to turn down cash with promises of future benefits.</p>
<p>"For the fifth consecutive year the management of Newman Tonks is promising jam tomorrow and asking shareholders to ignore the earnings and share price performance  of the last five years," FKI chief executive Bob Beeston said.</p>
<p>Earlier, building supplier Newman Tonks rejected FKI's 195.7 million stg cash and shares bid as "opportunistic", saying the offer undervalued the company and its prospects.  </p>
<p>Newman Tonks has undergone a restructuring over the last five years to turn the group into what it calls "a modern focused market-led and coordinated group" to give it the potential for "significant" long term growth.</p>
<p>FKI, which is also offering a cash alternative of 140p per share valuing Newman Tonks at 182.6 million stg, has already won the backing of two of Newman Tonks's institutional shareholders. M&amp;G, Newman Tonks' largest investor with an 11.18 percent stake in the company, is supporting the offer along with Britannic Assurance, which has a 2.19 percent holding.</p>
