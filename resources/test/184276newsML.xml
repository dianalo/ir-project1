<p>Vietnam will auction 50 billion dong ($4.52 million) in one-year Treasury notes on Wednesday, an official at the State Bank of Vietnam said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>At the last sale of government paper, on October 23, the central bank issued 27 billion dong worth of one-year notes to domestic institutions at an annual rate of 7.89 percent.</p>
<p>There have been 14 such sales so far this year, through which a total of 887 billion dong in Treasury stock has been issued. The central bank has been aiming to hold one auction every two weeks to lay the ground for a future secondary market.</p>
<p>Rates have fallen sharply this year, partly due to a dong surplus in the banking system. At the first sale of the year, on March 1, the state bank sold six-month bills at a rate of 15.00 percent. ($1 = 11,065 dong)</p>
