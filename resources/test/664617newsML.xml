<p>European Union leaders on Monday agreed an employment chapter to be incorporated into a new treaty, a Finnish diplomat told reporters at a two-day EU summit in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>"Based on what has come out of the meeting it has been agreed," he said.</p>
<p>The employment chapter in the revised Maastricht Treaty, initially a Nordic initiative, provides for incentive measures to boost cooperation on employment between member states.</p>
<p>This would primarily be through initiatives aimed at developing the exchange of information and the promotion of innovative approaches, such as limited European Union backing for pilot jobs projects.</p>
<p>These would be reviewed on an annual basis.</p>
