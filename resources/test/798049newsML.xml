<p>China has expressed support for economic ties between Cambodia and Taiwan and was willing to discuss an air link between Taipei and Phnom Penh, the Cambodian government said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Cambodian leader Hun Sen and a government delegation met China's First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Tang Jiaxuan on their current visit to Beijing, the government said in a statement.</p>
<p>"China supports Cambodia having private economic and trade relations with Taiwan," said the statement sent from the government delegation in Beijing and issued by the information ministry in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>"China still cooperates well with Cambodia," said the statement.</p>
<p>Cambodia follows a one-China policy.</p>
<p>Hun Sen and the Cambodian delegation are in Beijing for a meeting with King Norodom Sihanouk, who has been staying there for medical treatment since February.</p>
<p>Hun Sen shut down Taipei's representative office in Phnom Penh on July 22 after alleging the office had been involved in supporting the ousted First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh. Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh on July 6.</p>
<p>Taiwan denied supporting the prince and closed Cambodia's office in Taipei on July 28. Taiwan said it would not reopen its Phnom Penh office until Hun Sen apologised for closing it.</p>
<p>China welcomed the closure of Taipei's office in Phnom Penh.</p>
<p>China, which considers Taiwan a renegade province, was irked earlier this year when Cambodia signed an agreement with Taipei to establish air links without consulting Beijing.</p>
<p>The Cambodian government put the agreement on hold pending Beijing's endorsement after Chinese criticism of the plan.</p>
