<p>Diversified property group Tuan Sing Holdings Ltd expects at least a double digit profit growth in financial year 1997 and saw good results for the year ending December 1996, said chief executive officer and managing director Hwang Soo Chin on Monday.  </p>
<p>"Based on our past business plans, our property division will continue to improve," Hwang told Reuters before the ground breaking ceremony of its new landed property project KingsVille in central Singapore.</p>
<p>He said while not expecting to repeat the triple digit profit growth for the full fiscal 1996, as seen in its first six months results this year, performance for 1996 should be "good".</p>
<p>For the six months ended June 1996, Tuan Sing recorded a 108 percent net profit growth to S$14.86 million.</p>
