<p>Pakistan's money rates jumped towards the close on Wednesday after opening at 14 percent because the market remained short of funds and dealers said they expected the rates to stay higher on Thursday.</p>
<p>"Trading remained choppy today as dealers held different views about the liquidity flows," one dealer said. "The overnight market traded in a wide range of 14 to 20 percent and initial deals were done at 14 percent.</p>
<p>"Rates shot up to 20 percent in the last trading hour because of tight liquidity and discounting of about 700 million rupees was reported," he said.</p>
<p>Dealers said the State (central) Bank of Pakistan conducted its weekly open market operation and mopped up around 450 million rupees in five-month paper at a cut-off yield of 16.45 percent . -- Amir Zia 9221-5685192</p>
