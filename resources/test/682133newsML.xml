<headline>CSCE cocoa runs to 9-year highs but ends off peaks.</headline>

<p>CSCE cocoa futures powered to nine-year highs on Tuesday, as bullish technical indicators and ongoing concerns about El Nino fueled continued speculative buying, dealers said.</p>
<p>"The specs are getting hotter and hotter for it," said Allendale analyst Jim Cordier. "And as long as there's talk of El Nino, cocoa will have a nice run."</p>
<p>Benchmark September rallied to a new life-of-contract high of $1,737 a tonne before light origin selling and local profit-taking slashed gains. At the close, September stood at $1,713, up $17.</p>
<p>Spot July rose $8, to $1,680, after rising to a fresh contract high of $1,700, the highest nearby level on the continuous weekly charts since May 1988. The back months -- which also set lifetime highs -- rose $17 to $25.</p>
<p>Cocoa prices headed higher at the opening, as speculators followed through on Monday's steep run-up, dealers said. They said continued fears that cocoa crops from Indonesia to West Africa could be hit by dry conditions due to the developing "El Nino" weather pattern underpinned the recent rally.</p>
<p>"There was nothing new today," said one trader. "But there's still El Nino and I think the specs are riding that."</p>
<p>But views the market was overbought sparked a sell-off, sending the September contract to an intraday low of $1,685 -- down $11 -- before another round of speculative buying emerged.</p>
<p>After running up some 15 percent this month, some traders said the market may be vunerable to a massive sell-off. They also cautioned that it is still very early to gauge the effects of El Nino on next year's harvest.</p>
<p>"Sentiment is bullish, but people are very afraid of a correction of size," said one trader. "Locals have toned down the size of their long positions. They're wary."</p>
<p>Traders said news of heavy rainfall during June in top-grower Ivory Coast, which Ivorian weather analysts said boosted prospects for the 1997/98 main cocoa crop, may offset some of the bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>Volume reached an estimated 15,015 lots.</p>
