<p>At least 10 people were killed on Wednesday when two bombs ripped through a crowded outdoor market in Jewish west Jerusalem, Israel's army radio said.</p>
<p>Witnesses said two explosions tore through the Mahane Yehuda market in swift succession at 1:18 p.m. (1018 GMT) near fruit stands crowded with lunchtime shoppers.</p>
<p>The radio quoted a police spokesman as saying 10 people were killed. Israel Radio put the number of wounded at 50.</p>
<p>"The scene here is awful," Israeli Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani told reporters. "All the wounded have been taken to hospital."</p>
<p>Witnesses said one man had his leg blown off. Blood covered the ground, where it mixed with the debris of fruit and vegetables sent flying.</p>
<p>"There was a bomb in the market a few minutes ago and of course there are casualties," a police spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>"There were two large explosions and then I saw body parts flying in the air. There was a big fireball right in my face," one witness told Israel Radio.</p>
<p>Another witness, storekeeper David Boneh, said he heard the two explosions three seconds apart. "Suddenly everything went black. My store is completely wrecked," he said.</p>
<p>Police ordered the area cleared and the wail of ambulance sirens sounded through the city.</p>
<p>The last big bomb blast to rock the Jewish state, on March 21, killed three Israeli women along with the Palestinian attacker, and wounded 42 people at an outdoor cafe in Tel Aviv.</p>
<p>Wednesday's explosions occurred on the eve of a planned visit to the region by U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross with what the United States says are "new ideas" to revive stalled peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p>Ross was expected to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat separately on Thursday.</p>
<p>Palestinians say Israeli settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip captured in the 1967 Middle East war is aimed at sinking their chances for a Palestinian state.</p>
<p>The two sides have had some contacts but no formal negotiations since March when bulldozers began carving up a hill in Arab East Jerusalem where Israel plans a new settlement.</p>
<p>Palestinians have conditioned a renewal of peace talks on an Israeli settlement freeze while Israel says Arafat's Palestinian Authority must take steps to halt violence against Israelis.</p>
