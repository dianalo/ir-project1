<p>Shares in software systems group Computershare Ltd jumped over 10 percent in Tuesday morning trade after it placed 2.29 million shares with The Royal Bank of Scotland Plc just after the market open.</p>
<p>At 12.10 p.m. (0210 GMT), Computershare shares were 90 cents or 10.59 percent up to a record high of A$9.40 in light trade.</p>
<p>Computershare said the Royal Bank investment would provide the group with a foothold in Britain and that the Scottish-based bank would decide within the next six months whether to move to Computershare systems.</p>
