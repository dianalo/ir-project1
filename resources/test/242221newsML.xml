<p>Marxist rebels of the Popular Revolutionary Army (EPR) have turned up in several towns in the poor, southwestern Mexican state of Guerrero in recent days to carry out peaceful propaganda campaigns, officials said on Saturday.</p>
<p>Dozens of armed guerrillas appeared in El Meson and nearby El Bano, some 140 miles (230 km) south of Mexico City, late on Friday to distribute propaganda and urge locals to help topple the government of President Ernesto Zedillo, the head of municipality where both towns are located, said.</p>
<p>He said army troops swept through the towns shortly after the rebels appeared but there were no reports of fighting.</p>
<p>Two days earlier about 150 EPR rebels briefly occupied the mayor's offices in San Jose de la Hacienda, another town in the same general area, mayor Fabian Gatica said.</p>
<p>State officials said on Saturday that a peasant leader, Bartolo Guzman, was killed by four masked men in Tepetixtla, 145 miles (240 km) south of Mexico City.</p>
<p>Guzman's brother, Benigno, is the leader of OCSS, a local peasant group that officials say has ties to the EPR. Some 17 OCSS members were killed by state police in 1995 -- an incident that may have helped create the EPR, local officials have said.</p>
<p>The EPR, which first appeared in June at a rally marking the anniversary of the massacre, said earlier this week it had temporarily suspended military operations to focus on a propaganda campaign.</p>
<p>At least 25 people have died in EPR attacks in several central and southern Mexican states since June.</p>
