<p>Bulgaria, Romania and Greece will meet later this month to iron out differences that are holding up construction of a Danube river bridge intended to ease Europe's access to the East.</p>
<p>"We agreed that the three foreign ministers from the three countries, as well as the ministers of transportation, will meet to find the crossing point between political and infrastructural interests," Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadejda Mihailova told Reuters.</p>
<p>Senior Greek diplomats said Mihailova met Romanian Foreign Minister Adrian Severin on the sidelines of a Balkan Foreign Ministers conference in this northern Greek city and agreed to meet in Athens later this month.</p>
<p>Romania and Bulgaria disagree on where to build the bridge, which is part of the European Union's trans-European network, to the dismay of Greece which would benefit from an easier access for its products to northern Europe.</p>
<p>Bulgaria wants the bridge to link Vidin and the Romanian town of Calafat. Romania prefers to make the link further east, connecting Turnu-Maguerele with Bulgaria's Nikopol. The two countries are now connected by a single, heavily congested bridge.</p>
<p>A feasibility study by an independent British firm showed that the eastern position favoured by Bulgaria would be better suited. The bridge, which would connect Europe with Turkey and the Middle East, is estimated to cost between $320 and $450 million.</p>
<p>Greece has pledged to help raise money from international organisations such as the European Investment Bank but has warned the two countries that funding would be at risk if the project continued to be dogged by delays.</p>
<p>Romanian officials at the meeting said the issue was not as urgent as when the crisis in former Yugoslavia made transport in the Balkans difficult and insisted that the bridge should be built where it suited Romanian interests or not at all.</p>
<p>"This is part of a major European corridor and should pass through the middle of Romania, not its corner," a senior Romanian diplomat told Reuters.</p>
<p>Trilateral meetings in the past failed to produce a compromise but Bulgaria appeared confident that the project would finally go through.</p>
<p>"Our government is very interested in this project, which is strategic for us because it is part of our country's European goal and we are interested in structural and transport projects that will help the whole economy," Mihailova said. --Athens Newsroom +301 3311812-4</p>
